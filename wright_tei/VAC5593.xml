               <p>MY first distinctly-remembered impressions of myself and those about me were received on the morning of my fifth birthday. This sharply-defined impression was undoubtedly the result of the unusual circumstances which marked this particular day, causing it to stand apart in my memory, an era in my childish life.</p> 
               <p>On that day I arrived, a weary little motherless waif, at the home which was to be mine for the future.</p> 
               <p>It was in fulfillment of a sacred promise, that my father, on his second marriage, transferred me to the care of my grandmother. On her death-bed, my mother, who was a Protestant, had exacted of my father, a faithful and zealous Catholic; the solemn promise that in case he married again, and the new wife was a Catholic, he would permit his only child to retain the faith of her mother, and remove her to the protection of her mother's family.</p> 
               <p>My father had readily consented to this; no doubt<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5593-00000005"/> he thought, in the fullness of his grief, that no new wife should ever take the place of the dying-for they had been wed but a few years, and were tenderly attached. But time brings changes; the thing he deemed impossible had come to pass, and he was married again. And, true to his plighted word, he had brought me this morning some six or seven miles across country, in his little donkey-cart, and delivered me, with all my "belongings," to the full and undisputed control of my grandmother.</p> 
               <p>My grandmother's home was different, indeed, from the one I had left. It was a picturesque cottage, with pointed gables and overhanging eaves, embowered in flowers and vines and scented shrubs. The "lodge" it was called, an appendage to the Hall just discernible through the spreading branches of the grand old trees that lined either side of the broad, winding avenue, stretching up from the gates to the great house.</p> 
               <p>My grandmother had been brought up as an upper servant at the Hall. Faithful and disinterested, the Greyton family were to her world and worship, and she in turn was held in high regard by them. Late in life she had married the head gardener on the estate, and my mother was the child of that marriage. When she became a widow the faithful servitor was installed portress of the lodge, a place which she had held now for many years.</p> 
               <p>The old master and mistress of her time, however, were long since dead, and the present Sir Robert, their only child, with his family, occupied the place. The change made no difference in my grandmother's situation. Sir Robert was her staunch friend, and always<pb n=""/> bore himself toward her with a kindness almost amounting to tenderness. She had been his nurse in early years, and it was said that there had been a certain romance connected with his days of youthful folly, when she had saved him and the honor of the family. And for this he ever, in after-years, held her in grateful remembrance. The tale, as I afterward learned it, was on this wise:</p> 
               <p>My mother, carefully reared, and educated above her class, had developed into great beauty. The young heir at the Hall meeting her occasionally in his rambles, or on his visits to his old nurse, fell rapturously in love with this young creature, just budding into sweet girlhood. Any special devotion to her under her mother's watchful eye was, of course, out of the question; and so, disguising himself as a rustic, the lad followed her from place to place, becoming more and more infatuated. A thoughtful young friend, seeing the impending danger, remonstrated with the youthful lover; the sole result of the expostulation was a quarrel, followed by a duel, in which the impolitic friend was severely wounded. Robert Greyton was obliged to fly. Still, so blindly was he infatuated, that on his knees he entreated my grandmother to let her daughter accompany him. He would marry her on the instant; she was dearer to him than life. But my grandmother was too wise to listen to such pleadings, and besides, the honor of the Greyton family was at stake. Through none belonging to her should a tinge of disgrace tarnish its ancient nobility. He must go; she would preserve her child.</p> 
               <p>He secretly left the country, and did not venture to return (although his wounded friend recovered) until<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5593-00000006"/> summoned by the death of the old lord. Then he came back, bringing with him a young wife, an English lady, said to be possessed of great wealth.</p> 
               <p>My mother, it was said, grieved for awhile, but her affections had not been deeply engaged, and she was very young. Submitting to the inevitable, she finally married in her own position in life-my father being a small farmer; and with him she lived happily the brief life allotted her.</p> 
               <p>The reader may gather from this outline some idea of those among whom I was ushered on the morning of my arrival. I did not then understand the deep sadness overshadowing the faces I looked upon, nor did I know of the many tender memories stirred that morning by my presence. It frightened me to see my father shed tears, and to hear my grandmother sob as she accepted the charge of her poor Honor's child. I looked from one to the other in childish terror, and when my father rose to depart clung to him tenaciously. No persuasion could lure me away, and it was amid cries and tears that I was torn from his arms.</p> 
               <p>My poor father! the struggle was a hard one for you, too, as I knew well in after-days.</p> 
               <p>Scarcely had I been quieted after my father's departure, when the rattle of wheels announced the approach of a vehicle. My grandmother knew it well; it was the family coach, and with her it was almost a religious duty to open the gates with her own hands whenever Sir Robert and his lady drove through. But she could not get rid of me; I was still in a painful tremor of excitement, an undefined terror lest something dreadful was about to happen, and I held to her so closely that<pb n=""/> she was obliged to open the gates as best she could, encumbered by my clinging hands.</p> 
               <p>In imagination I can still see those huge steeds, as with prancing steps and foam-flecked jaws they proudly entered. Viewed from my diminutive standpoint, and judged by an experience limited to the dear old donkey that browsed in front of my father's door, the well-kept animals did indeed appear like some gigantic monsters ready to swallow me up, and, in view of this danger, I kept myself prudently in the shadow of my grandmother's skirts.</p> 
               <p>In the carriage, a large, open one, sat a stately company, whose names I afterward knew. They were Sir Robert and Lady Greyton, and their two children, Arthur and Florence.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, who have we here?" said Sir Robert's hearty voice, as he looked down into my frightened face. "A bright little maid, by my faith!"</p> 
               <p>"Who?" echoed her ladyship, while the children in different strains caught up the interrogation.</p> 
               <p>My poor grandmother's heart was still full of tears, and she answered with a broken voice, "It is my poor Honor's little girl, come to me at last."</p> 
               <p>"Ah!" said Sir Robert, and there was a pause. Then he added, looking at me, "But there is little resemblance to her mother, now. She is more like yourself."</p> 
               <p>"So they say," answered my grandmother with a deep sigh.</p> 
               <p>"And how old is the child?" asked Lady Grace.</p> 
               <p>Just five to-day, my lady."</p> 
               <p>"Dear me! our Florence is just five years old to-day,<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5593-00000007"/> also, and how much stouter this little girl is. What is her name?"</p> 
               <p>"Olive."</p> 
               <p>"A pretty name," said Sir Robert. "Come, let the little girls kiss each other on their birthday;" and in a twinkling I was lifted into the centre of the group. I remember the sweet kiss of the little fairy who sat there embowered in silks and roses; I remember a strange sensation, as if I were being wafted through the air amid sweet sounds and floating perfumes, and then everything vanished. Overcome by fatigue and excitement, I had fainted away.</p> 
               <p>When I opened my eyes again they rested upon my grandmother nodding by the bedside. It took a little time to recall my scattered wits. I was not hurt, I was not scared; I felt, indeed, decidedly happy; why then was I lying here? What did it all mean? The room was a small one. I had never seen anything so nice before; so cozily shut in and comfortable. The walls were white, the curtains of the bed white, the covering under which I lay was like a snow-drift. Looking through the open door just beyond me, I saw an outer room of apparently much larger dimensions. Beneath an open window in this room (a latticed window nearly darkened by close-clustering vines) sat a young boy. He seemed to me very tall and fair. In front of him, upon a table, was spread out a map or paper, I could not tell which; his head was bent down over it so intently that I could not see his face. The light was very uncertain and dim, only as the breeze outside fluttered the thick vine-leaves could a glimpse of the fading sunlight enter, yet the lad still pored over his<pb n=""/> studies, unmindful of the gathering shadows. I looked long and wonderingly at this picture, framed in the vine-hung window opposite, and finally I asked, "Who is he?" I put the question in a whisper, touching my grandmother's sleeve as she sat at my bedside.</p> 
               <p>"Bless me, child!" was her startled exclamation, "I thought you were still asleep."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no; I've been awake ever so long-but who <emph>is</emph> that?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, that's Walter, my pretty bird. And are you really quite well, now?" My poor grandmother was evidently much relieved to find me "coming to" again with a child's natural inquisitiveness. She called cheerily to the young student, "Come, Walter, Olive wants to see you."</p> 
               <p>My heart leaped out to the bright smiling face that now came towards me. Walter lifted me from the bed with strong and careful arms; he carried me out into the large room.</p> 
               <p>There we presently had tea; and Walter was so kind and I was shown so much honor, and so humored with all the dainties on the table, that I was charmed out of my usual shyness. All this was so different from my accustomed fare of porridge and milk, and I was so hungry, that I think a happier child than that evening closed upon was not to be found in Ireland.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
               <head type="sub">NEW FRIENDS.</head> 
               <p>AFTERWARD I learned more about Walter. The lad was an orphan. His father had been a laborer upon the estate, and at his death Sir Robert took charge of the boy, who was without near relatives, and when he was old enough to be of some service transferred him to my grandmother to be made useful about the lodge.</p> 
               <p>He had not been there long before my advent. My grandmother, not much given to manifestations of affection, had nevertheless taken kindly to the boy; indeed, I believe now she had a much more tender regard for him than she ever had for me. My shy ways and constrained habits, which to one of her quick and energetic nature must have appeared as either sullenness or stupidity, contrasted unfavorably, I doubt not, with his earnest, direct looks, and frank, open demeanor.</p> 
               <p>"I can always tell what Walter wants and thinks," the old lady would say; "but I cannot do so with you, Olive."</p> 
               <p>But Walter understood me better; I felt sure of this. From the first we were good friends. Being a few years older than myself gave him an importance in my eyes, and great authority; I was always ready to be guided by what he said; and, indeed, in those early days he taught me whatever I knew.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Before he came to the lodge, when he was living a lonely little fellow in his father's cabin, the old priest of the parish had been attracted by his bright intelligence, and had taught him to read and write. Walter was an apt pupil. "We will make a priest of him yet," the good father would say; "I am doing the church some service, my lad, in bringing such gifts to the altar."</p> 
               <p>When the boy was removed to my grandmother's care the persistent father still continued his visits and lessons. My grandmother put no obstacles in his way, but she was very careful to have me out of hearing. I believe she would rather have had me grow up in utter ignorance than have caught one gleam of knowledge from what she deemed so unholy a source. But to Walter's transferring this knowledge to me there could be no objection; and I came to long for the evenings when, with books and maps, and primer and slate, Walter, constituting himself my instructor, labored diligently to open the channels of my slow understanding. I took delight in those lessons, so new, so strange a world they opened to me; and gradually but surely I grew to feel the joy of acquisition apart from the mere pleasure of my young teacher's approbation. Those were happy, innocent hours; if I tasted no keen delights I knew no special deprivations, and with a child's adaptability I had transferred all my affections and interests to my new home.</p> 
               <p>Thus passed five years. I had no companion outside of our little home; in truth, I desired none. My grandmother would not admit of any association with those of our own rank in life. She was an humble<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5593-00000009"/> woman, she would say, but she could not allow that. Her aspirations soared much higher; humility was certainly not one of her weaknesses. One who was honored by the protection and regard of the Greyton family, and had been so long one of them, should feel it her duty to preserve an exclusive dignity. And she obliged me to do so, too. Walter, as an occasional indulgence, was permitted to visit some young friends at the little town of Arklow, a few miles distant; but I must keep at home.</p> 
               <p>Yet I was far from unhappy. I desired nothing more. Walter was everything to me, and would he but tell me all he saw and heard I was fully satisfied.</p> 
               <p>Of the young people at the Hall all this time I saw but little, and that little at a distance. Concealed behind the overhanging vines of my grandmother's porch, I would often gaze in a sort of fascinated wonder out over the broad avenue, and under the branching trees, on all that was visible of that life beyond me, so exalted, as I deemed it, yet so luring to my fancy. Often gay groups of visitors, in every fanciful variety of dress and color, would saunter about on that lawn, where to my eyes the grass looked greener and the sun shone brighter than anywhere else. But the figure that ever most fixed my rapt attention was that of the little girl Florence, as she flitted about followed by her dog, a fine specimen of the Irish greyhound. She was truly a revelation to me; her fair hair, her white, gauzy dress, and blue sash ever fluttering in her quick movements,-she was a vision, a dream, to my excited imagination. I never connected myself in any way with what I saw, I would not even speak about my fancies<pb n=""/> to Walter; I had an instinctive dread that he might laugh at me for a miserable little idolater.</p> 
               <p>But circumstances were most unexpectedly bringing about some changes that were likely to draw me into that charmed circle whether I would or not.</p> 
               <p>One day Lady Grace made a visit to the lodge. This was quite an unusual circumstance; I had seen her once in our cottage, but that was when my grandmother was ill. On this morning of her visit she spoke to me most kindly and asked my grandmother many questions about me, and then I was requested to walk out in the garden a little while; I might pick her ladyship a bunch of flowers. She wished to speak with my grandmother alone a few minutes.</p> 
               <p>The result of this interview was an invitation for me to spend a few days at the Hall. The cause which led to the unexpected honor was this: the young daughter of the house was growing up in feeble health; there was much anxiety about her. The family physician had recommended out-door exercise,-not the formal routine of riding or walking with governess or nurse, but real, downright romping and playing with those of her own age.</p> 
               <p>Some weeks previous a young relative of Lady Grace had been sent for from London. She had come accompanied by her mother for the purpose of making a long visit; but Florence had taken a dislike to the young miss; they could not assimilate. The young lady had to be entertained, not to entertain; the pursuits of a country life did not suit her. She might have borne with Arthur, who was now a large boy, and came nearer her own age, but Florence she could not<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5593-00000010"/> have forever after her; and so no love was lost, and the attempt had finally to be considered an utter failure.</p> 
               <p>Sir Robert and Lady Grace then turned their thoughts on me. I was the right age, strong and sturdy; and any one under my grandmother's care must be well brought up, of this they were sure. At any rate the trial might be made, and so the invitation was given.</p> 
               <p>I strongly opposed the arrangement. My grandmother scolded, "Was I not ashamed? Had not little Miss Florence sent me so many pretty playthings, dolls and the like? and now, when she wanted to see me and have me with her a little while, I was crying about it."</p> 
               <p>And I was ashamed, but I had such a dread in my shyness of going anywhere, and, above all, among such wonderful people, that the anticipation lay like a nightmare on my dreams. But I must submit; and so, dressed in my clean new gingham, my face swollen with tears and shining with a generous ablution of soap and water, I set forth, accompanied by Walter, who was to introduce me to the housekeeper, Mrs. O'Neil.</p> 
               <p>"Good-by, grandmother," I cried, scarcely able to restrain my tears, as I looked back at her standing in the doorway.</p> 
               <p>"Only for a day or two, you little simpleton," she said, but smiled more kindly than her wont.</p> 
               <p>"And I suppose," said Walter, as we walked slowly along, "you will get to be so grand at the big house, you'll forget all about us!"</p> 
               <p>Walter spoke with asperity. Ah, he little knew the terror that big house and all about it had for me to-day. I could scarcely keep down a sob.</p> 
               <p>"And Master Arthur," added he, "will be so pleasant<pb n=""/> ant, no doubt! oh, amazingly condescending! But I hate Arthur,-yes, I hate him! even though everybody calls him so handsome and so genteel. <emph>He's</emph> no gentleman! He kicks the stable-boys and puts on such airs."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, dear, what a bad boy!" I answered, in sympathetic indignation. "I'm sure he's not a bit handsome,-not half so handsome as you are, Walter. I heard Father Keane say to grandmother the other day that you were the handsomest lad in the county."</p> 
               <p>This seemed rather to mollify my companion; he spoke in rather gentler tones, as he said, "Master Arthur is as good as others, I suppose, but they all think they may knock us boys about. They'd better not try it on me," he added, with a suggestive shrug; "I will go to America, where the people are free, as soon as I can. Mike Noonan and I are going, for he says we can be as good as anybody there."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Walter! not before I come back!"</p> 
               <p>At that Walter laughed; and, chattering thus, we reached the side entrance of the Hall.</p> 
               <p>The family were not yet stirring, but Mrs. O'Neil received us into her room and invited us to breakfast. Everything looked very tempting, and the walk in the fresh air had whetted my appetite, so I partook with considerable zest of the nice muffins and eggs so kindly pressed on me, and almost forgot the dreaded ordeal in store.</p> 
               <p>When Walter left, my heart-sinking came back; but Mrs. O'Neil was so kind and talked so pleasantly, telling me what a nice little girl Florence was, and how she knew I would like her, that I quite cheered up again.</p> 
               <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5593-00000011"/> 
               <p>At length a servant came and said Lady Grace wished to see me in the breakfast-parlor. I followed her through a long passage, and then another and another. A door opened, I saw a glare of light, I heard a hum of voices, and all the rest was a bewildering chaos. It seemed as if some great eye were upon me, transfixing me into stone.</p> 
               <p>Then I heard a voice, as if far distant, saying, "Come, my dear, speak to me;" but I could not move, neither utter a sound.</p> 
               <p>At that moment some young people, entering through the low window, bounded into the room. The suddenness of their appearance roused me a little: I could see Florence and Arthur; I knew their faces, but who the tall girl was who pushed in front of them I did not know.</p> 
               <p>As she looked at me she burst into a loud laugh, whispering to Arthur so that I could hear, "Did you ever see such a guy?"</p> 
               <p>I was not insensible to this rudeness; it stirred my pride and restored me somewhat to myself. I could now both see and hear Lady Grace, as she said, "Adele, be more careful; this is our young friend from the lodge."</p> 
               <p>"Friend!" repeated the pert girl, "Florence's friend? Ha! ha! do introduce me!" and again she burst into immoderate laughter.</p> 
               <p>Sir Robert now rose hastily from the table where he had been looking over the morning papers; he came forward with an angry frown. "Stop your confounded impudence," he said, harshly, "or you shall leave the room on the instant."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Of course there was some confusion. The young lady pouted and her mother said some indignant words, but I was relieved, for Florence and myself were left alone.</p> 
               <p>And what a relief it was! The little girl, on the first rude outbreak of her companion, had crept close to me and taken my hand, and then had put her arm about my neck. My whole heart went out to her; yet even then, when we were alone, my tongue refused to utter a sound, although in my overwhelming gratitude I could have knelt down and worshiped her.</p> 
               <p>But Florence did not heed my silence; she was only intent, in her sweet, simple way, on making me happy. She brought me her books and toys, and we sat down on the carpet-that carpet that seemed to me indeed a bed of roses-and looked over the treasures together.</p> 
               <p>Such contentment I felt! The sun was shining in on us; the beautiful park outside, the splendors within, the shining mirrors, the beautiful pictures, the everything,-and I there, and so happy! It must be a dream.</p> 
               <p>We sat there some time; the servants were in and out clearing away the breakfast things, polishing the tables, and putting all things in order. Suddenly, as I sat there absorbed, my eyes busy with what was before them, a sound reached my ear; I started up, scattering everything about. "Oh, let me go!" I cried.</p> 
               <p>"Where,-what is it?"</p> 
               <p>"She's coming!"</p> 
               <p>"Who?"</p> 
               <p>"That girl!" I exclaimed, shivering; "that horrid girl! Oh, let me get away!"</p> 
               <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5593-00000012"/> 
               <p>"Yes, let us run and hide," responded Florence, quickly; "it'll be such fun!" And in an instant we had leaped out upon the gravel walk.</p> 
               <p>Outside we paused a moment. Yes, there were the voices again. She was with Arthur, coming back, doubtless, to have a little more sport tormenting me.</p> 
               <p>But we were off. How we ran! They missed us from the house, and now they were calling us by name, and evidently in close pursuit. Still, on we flew. Gaining the garden and feeling secure, as we skirted along its high hedge, we scampered on, turning over flower-pots, jumping flower-beds, to the general detriment of all that came in our way.</p> 
               <p>Our pursuers had evidently taken another track now, for their voices grew more distant; still we eagerly sought a more secure hiding-place.</p> 
               <p>Florence pointed out, at the extremity of the garden, a low door, almost hidden in the wall, which was covered by vines and bushes. Could we but open that we would be safe. It yielded to our vigorous efforts sufficiently to let us pass through, but with considerable damage to our bare arms and summer frocks. That was a matter of small importance, however, under the circumstances. We were completely out of sight now. A flight of stone steps descended steeply from the gate to a rapid stream in a wild gorge below, which formed the boundary of the grounds. There were plenty of scraggy bushes and wild vines to shield us there, and with laughter and suppressed exclamations of delight we awaited the result; I forgetting all my shyness in companionship with this bright little wood-spirit at my side.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>We could still hear the voices calling us, and with every sound we gave way to fresh bursts of delight, Florence fairly dancing with glee.</p> 
               <p>Presently there was utter silence. "They are gone," I said, drawing a long breath. "No, they are only making-believe gone." And then we waited, it seemed for a very long time, hovering on tiptoe in our covert, and keeping an outlook for the enemy. By-and-by we heard voices again: many voices, and among them the agonized tones of Lady Grace, as she cried, "They have opened the gate; they are down by that dangerous stream. Oh, Florence, Florence!"</p> 
               <p>"Mamma, mamma, here I am!" cried the little girl, springing toward the group who now pushed open the gate. "Here I am! Don't be frightened, mamma, it was only fun! Only fun, papa!"</p> 
               <p>Others now came running up, servants and visitors and gardeners. There had been great alarm, we had disappeared so suddenly and inexplicably. Sir Robert smiled and frowned both; he made some attempt at reproof, but seeing our disordered appearance, and the earnest, flushed face of his little daughter, he suddenly caught her in his arms, saying, "Well, Grace, I believe we have found the right thing, after all. Let the little maidens work it out in their own way."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A HOLIDAY.</head> 
               <p>THERE were now many changes brought about; my invitation was extended to a month. The children were to have a holiday. Arthur had begged that he, too, might be released from books and study, and have a season of relaxation and sport in the open air as well as his sister; and, after some coaxing, his father had consented.</p> 
               <p>So tutor and governess were relieved for a time, and there was a general stir of hilarity. Adele and her mother only wore clouded countenances. It was quite evident they were piqued, although they would not admit such was the case. Adele declared she would not, could not stay in this "horrid Ireland," and Mrs. Fortescue, her mother, when politely pressed to leave the young lady behind on her departure, haughtily responded that "no persuasion could induce her to leave her child exposed to certain influences." Poor me! if I thought at all, it was the first time I surmised there was any influence about me.</p> 
               <p>Of course after such insinuations there was no obstacle put in the way of their speedy departure. Sir Robert was to accompany them to the English packet.</p> 
               <p>It appeared the lady took occasion during the journey to advise and warn Sir Robert.</p> 
               <p>"It is about our dear Florence, so innocent and<pb n=""/> guileless, that I am most anxious. Poor Grace is <emph>so</emph>, yielding (there might be two opinions about that, doubtless thought Sir Robert), and she has become so accustomed to these people, that she really does not perceive the danger; but we who see with English eyes, are more, more-ah, you perceive?"</p> 
               <p>"'Pon my word I do not," returned the gentleman, completely mystified.</p> 
               <p>"Well-ah-you saw the quick repugnance of my Adele to that little low-bred rustic?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, now you speak of it, I do remember. But I think I would give it another name, my good cousin."</p> 
               <p>"The name is of little consequence," said the lady, sharply, "it was the instinct I noticed. But Florence, sweet child, seemed to adapt herself at once to the circumstances; and it is to warn you, as a friend, against such tendencies, that I venture to speak, Sir Robert. An aptitude to low tastes cannot too early be repressed. Remember she is the child of my much-loved Grace,-let that be my apology."</p> 
               <p>There were some uneasy motions and clearings of the throat on the part of the listener, as if he were undergoing the process of mental suffocation; still no word was spoken.</p> 
               <p>"But," continued the lady, "I would not have you misunderstand me. I do quite admire the Irish."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, thank you," with a smile of somewhat dubious meaning playing about his frank face, "I am, we are infinitely obliged to you for your flattering opinion."</p> 
               <p>"You mistake, my dear Sir Robert; I should never<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5593-00000014"/> think of classing you with these people. You are one of us."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, thank you again!" with the same questionable smile, "but I believe I must decline the honor. I am no cosmopolitan,-I prefer to belong somewhere, and at present I am quite content. In truth I must confess"-and here there was something of haughty elevation in his tone-"I am rather proud of my home and birthplace."</p> 
               <p>All this I heard as Sir Robert repeated it to Lady Grace on his return. I suppose he thought so stupid a little thing as myself would not understand the drift of all this,-a rather risky experiment.</p> 
               <p>"But," he continued, "you know she was under my escort, and gallantry would not permit me to do otherwise than I did; but I longed to say to her as I do to you, Grace, that I considered her a confounded fool."</p> 
               <p>I fancied her ladyship did not listen to her husband with cordial sympathy, and I was very sure she did not look on me with pleasant eyes. "It is unfortunate," she sighed; "Adele would certainly have been a much better companion for our Florence."</p> 
               <p>"I'm not so sure of that," was the blunt reply, as Sir Robert rose to leave the room.</p> 
               <p>On the morning of her departure Adele had declared her sentiments in regard to me without any of this circumlocution. I was wandering listlessly among the paths about the house, anything but happy in this new state of things; I longed to see Walter, and to be with my grandmother again. I was indeed miserable and lonely; the garden and house were solitary; only the<pb n=""/> servants apparently were astir. I was wiping away a few tears shyly, as not to be acknowledged even by myself, when I was startled by the sudden appearance of Adele, who, gliding softly through the low window of the drawing-room, where the maids were dusting, came hastily to my side. She whispered in my ear hurriedly and sharply these words,-I remember even now the thrill almost of fear with which I heard them:</p> 
               <p>"How I hate you, you mean, sneaking little jackanapes! Nobody wants you here! Everybody hates you as I do, except that silly Florence, and she'll soon find you out!"</p> 
               <p>To this hurried communication I had not a word to answer; in fact, it was all a sort of muddle to me, the prominent thought in my mind being-what was there to find out; what could it be?</p> 
               <p>After the departure of these guests things began to work smoothly, and we entered gleefully into the preparations for our gala days. Florence was to be dressed loosely and coarsely like myself. Even Arthur was to be transformed into a country lad, and with our dogs we were to be at liberty, under certain restrictions, to range where we pleased. Oh, the pleasure of looking back on those days of freedom! Freedom was the great idea; Florence was in an ecstasy, and Arthur also, as far as his dignity would permit.</p> 
               <p>Fortune had favored us in fixing our birthplace in one of the loveliest spots of the island. Wicklow, "the Garden of Ireland," as it is called, is not as famous as many other places for its antiquities, or the wildness of its scenery; but for finished cultivation and picturesque loveliness it can hardly be surpassed. And<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5593-00000015"/> fearing that my enthusiastic love for the dear place may mislead my judgment into exaggerated statements, let me use the words of another, who says,-</p> 
               <p>"In this district of Ireland are to be found assembled a variety of natural beauties, heightened and improved by the hand of art. Here we may behold lakes of more than Alpine beauty; streams that wind through quiet dells or roll their sparkling waters down rugged precipices; deep glens and sombre ravines where the dark mountain-shadows make twilight of the summer noon; mountains whose bare and craggy peaks seem to pierce the clouds; romantic woodlands, picturesque glades, with fertile fields and warm, pleasant valleys, whose quiet pastoral beauties remind us of the Golden Age."</p> 
               <p>And this is neither an ideal nor an exaggerated picture. Among such fair scenes, with youth and health, how could we fail of enjoyment?</p> 
               <p>Of course it will not be supposed that in these childish explorations of our beautiful island we looked on with either an appreciative or an instructed eye. Our enjoyment was rather sensuous than sentimental. It was only in later years that these scenes and sights became the living memories on which we loved to dwell.</p> 
               <p>It was customary to send for us to the drawing-room after our day of sport,-that is if no company were present; and we were expected to relate our adventures, and encouraged to speak freely of our rambles and pleasures. I could not possibly overcome my shyness on these occasions, but Arthur and Florence rattled on without restraint.</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, papa," said Florence, after a jocose remark<pb n=""/> mark from Sir Robert that he wondered whether I could talk, "Olive <emph>can</emph> talk; you ought to have heard her when we were among the beautiful mountains to-day. Olive said more than any of us, till she began to cry."</p> 
               <p>"Cry?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; I hardly know what for,-but something she said about it making her feel like kneeling down-as if-as if-oh, papa, as if God was there!"</p> 
               <p>"Why, the little maid has the soul of a poet, after all. Come, my little girl, you need not be ashamed."</p> 
               <p>And drawing me kindly toward him, Sir Robert stroked my hair, as he looked in my burning face with inexpressible kindness, and said, "You need not be ashamed, my child. It was the natural instinct of worship, honorable to your intelligence and heart."</p> 
               <p>Of course I did not wholly understand these words, but I did understand the warm approval, the cordial manner; these helped me to a confidence I greatly needed.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">ADVENTURES.</head> 
               <p>OUR holiday-month was drawing to a close. With something more than regret we saw our four weeks of unfettered out-door life passing away; such regret as I fancy a vagrant gypsy-band might feel when called in from their wild roamings to undergo the restraints of conventional life.</p> 
               <p>To me it had been a time of uninterrupted felicity. I had come to feel quite at home with my young companions in these unrestrained days; joyous, innocent freedom had for a time overcome my clumsy shyness, and bridged over the wide chasm of social distinction between us. I forgot, and I think they also forgot, that any difference existed.</p> 
               <p>Arthur would occasionally, boy-like, assume authority, but this same authority was equally exercised over his sister. He was a good leader, and would we always follow his guidance (which we generally did) without question, then there would be less occasion, he hinted, for the exercise of his superior masculine wisdom. Also there would be fewer sneers-which a little fretted us sometimes, especially Florence-at our girlish incompetency. But still these troubles were but momentary, generally ending with a laugh. We had a great respect for the young gentleman, his three additional years of life's experience giving him great<pb n=""/> importance in our eyes, and as a matter of course it was our place to submit.</p> 
               <p>And then Florence, like a sweet wild flower, kept the fragrance of beauty and love around me, charming to awakened life those deeper emotions which in my duller nature had laid comparatively dormant, and I clung to her with a sentiment akin almost to adoration.</p> 
               <p>She had grown so strong and blooming in this month of joyous liberty that it was a pleasure to look at her. The fair, pale face was now as blushing as the rose, and the brightness and elasticity of healthful life was in her every movement.</p> 
               <p>"And must we," said her father, looking fondly at her, "again impose those rules and restraints that nearly killed the child?"-Florence was jumping out of one low window and in at another, her great dog, almost as high as herself, bounding after her, while Arthur and I sat apart listening to what was said-"Yes, break her down to them by clipping these butterfly wings. By Jove! Grace," he added, partly aside, "I feel disposed to break loose and let her have her own way."</p> 
               <p>"Be careful, Sir Robert," answered her ladyship, guardedly; "such sentiments are dangerous for the young people to hear: our children are born to a certain position, and we would fail in duty to them as well as to society were they not fitted to sustain it."</p> 
               <p>"Society," was the rather contemptuous reply; "and what is society? Is it our best friend, our dearest and wisest, to whom we would turn for counsel and encouragement? No, emphatically no; it is a bubble, a sham, forever working under false pretenses.<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5593-00000017"/> If I am up, it will puff me still higher; if I am down, it will crush me still lower. Confound it, we are society-slaves; it is not what we think best, it is what the world will approve."</p> 
               <p>Oh, dear! I thought, he must be very angry. I looked at his flushed face in alarm as he sat bolt upright on the edge of his great, comfortable chair, beating an impatient tattoo with his foot; and then I looked at Lady Grace; but there she sat as unruffled as the flowers she was creating on the canvas in her embroidery-frame.</p> 
               <p>I was reassured. Her ladyship knew her husband well, perhaps better than he knew himself, and felt there was no occasion for alarm. Large-hearted, impulsive, with generous emotions easily roused, he lacked that persistency which would have made his theories and notions effectual. The resolves of to-day with him would vanish with the difficulties of the morrow. He loved ease, pleasure, and abundance; all these he could command; why trouble himself about that he could not alter? after all he might be in the wrong. And so his many resolves and plans about what might be generally ended, and her ladyship had her way.</p> 
               <p>Lady Grace loved the world and all its belongings; with her its wishes were final, and its minutest decrees sacred as the laws of antiquity. An excellent person she was, exact, conscientious, but limited in her loves and sympathies as she was in her tastes and passions.</p> 
               <p>But we were not yet to be deprived of our gypsy roamings. A note came from Miss Lucas begging off for a few days, and Arthur's tutor had not yet returned; so another day might be ours at any rate; and the Hall,<pb n=""/> too, was filled with guests; there was some famous hunt going on, and we could very well be spared.</p> 
               <p>This suited us exactly. There was one other exploration we wished to make. At least Arthur had talked us, simple girls, into the desire. Oh, yes, we would, we must go! It would be delightful; and yet all the time we had a secret consciousness we ought not to go. The proposed expedition would not meet the approval of our elders, in fact it would be, we knew, considered dangerous; and although not in words forbidden, yet we understood it the same. The gorge, or deep ravine, that bounded the Greyton estate, leading off we knew not where, we had talked so much about, and listened to so many stories of its wild loneliness, that I fear the spirit of adventure roused had deadened our sense of duty. We had planned a secret expedition thither.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I do so wish we could go!" whispered Florence.</p> 
               <p>"And I <emph>will</emph> go," was Arthur's bold rejoinder.</p> 
               <p>"But papa and mamma-."</p> 
               <p>"They will not know anything about it."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Arthur!"</p> 
               <p>"You always take me up so quick. I mean we need not trouble them about it; papa goes with the gentlemen to hunt in the morning, and mamma drives with the ladies to the Dargle, intending to luncheon there. I heard them make all the arrangements; so if we start early, before any one is up, we can be back before they return, and then they will be saved all fear about us."</p> 
               <p>The argument was hardly conclusive, even to our unsophisticated ears; but the temptation was so strong, that even Florence at last yielded.</p> 
               <p>Arthur won the good housekeeper over-although<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5593-00000018"/> much against her judgment-to give us an early breakfast in her room.</p> 
               <p>It must be admitted that this secrecy and little dash of daring added much to the interest of the thing. The early morning proved all we could desire; the air was bright and beaming; it was an exhilaration to breathe it. All life and joy, we glided noiselessly along the house-paths; our merry hearts were full of anticipation of childish glee; Sappho following with becoming gravity, as if impressed with the importance of his mission, carrying our little basket of good things between his great jaws.</p> 
               <p>We need not have had any fears of being discovered; the long line of windows in the tall house were still tightly closed; even the servants were scarcely astir.</p> 
               <p>"I do wonder," said Arthur, with an almost contemptuous pity, "how people can shut themselves in their close rooms, and lie in their beds such a morning as this."</p> 
               <p>"It is well for us they do not take a peep out," answered Florence, quickly.</p> 
               <p>"Do you suppose I should care if they did, Miss Pert?" was the impatient reply; adding with more dignity, "I do wish you would have less to say."</p> 
               <p>Poor Florence was used to these rebuffs, but gave them little heed; at this time it was doubtful if she heard; for, before his sentence was finished, she was in full race over the park grass, scattering the diamond-drops of early dew without any reference to wet feet or drabbled skirts. It was impossible not to follow, and we were soon all with headlong speed making for the declivity we were to descend to the stream.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>When we had descended the steep, zigzag path that brought us to the bottom of the ravine, we were quite out of breath, but instead of sitting down to rest, we were so impatient to see more that we pushed right on.</p> 
               <p>The narrow path we kept alongside the stream made anything but pleasant traveling; it was rough and uneven, often interrupted by masses of fallen stone from the rocks above; but it would have taken many more difficulties than these to dampen our adventurous ardor. We could climb and jump, but we had not calculated on the fatigue a few hours of this jumping and climbing might bring, till, alas! we found ourselves feeling very tired indeed. Still, with renewed courage and a cheering word from Arthur we would again move on bravely.</p> 
               <p>The clear water of the narrow stream that flowed by our path was bright and bubbling; relieving, by its sweet and gentle murmurings, the profound stillness of the glen, which had become almost oppressive.</p> 
               <p>"Dear me, how quiet it is! where are we going?" asked Florence, in a frightened tone, as her eyes wandered timidly over the steep, smooth sides of the wall that now closed us in on either side. "Oh, dear, it is so dark and deep; let us go back, Arthur! Come, Olive, I cannot stay."</p> 
               <p>But Arthur's spirit rose with the occasion; he ridiculed such fears. "Go back! no indeed," and again we started forward. We found it, however, hard work: even our brave guide began to fail; and, indeed, it was beginning to be evident that even if we wished we could not go much farther. The path was now a mere<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5593-00000019"/> strip, and soon ended altogether against a projecting ledge of rock too high to mount and pass over.</p> 
               <p>We were now in despair; we had been hoping there might be some lowering of these fearful walls, or some outlet where we could free ourselves from this prison; but, alas, for these vain hopes, we were more shut in than ever. What would we do? Go back? that was impossible, we were so thoroughly tired and we had passed over so many dangerous, difficult places, we dare not face them again.</p> 
               <p>Florence began to cry bitterly, "Oh, dear, we have been so wicked; poor papa and mamma! We knew we ought not to have come. We will die, we will be lost in this horrid place, oh, dear! oh, dear! And the mischievous fairies would love to drag us into that deep water. They always come to such dismal holes, and when one has been bad, too. Dear! dear! Kathleen told me so."</p> 
               <p>Fortunately for me I never had a Kathleen to fill my young brain with imaginary terrors. I began to look at the situation as it was before me. The water in this narrowed strip looked most uninviting; it seemed as if the huge rock in the bed of the stream had been cleft asunder to barely admit its passage. It was deep and dark, there were no pebbly stones invitingly in sight, nor soft murmurs to beguile away fear; but I will try it, I said to myself; and while Arthur was vainly endeavoring to reassure Florence, I had slipped off my shoes and stockings and was trying the depth of the stream. To my unexpected joy I found foothold; when with a loud cry of exultation I sprang around the ledge, calling on the others to follow.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Such was the change, and such the sense of relief, that we were, for the moment, wild with delight at our escape from the desolate ravine to the bloom of verdure, sunshine, and light. Those great walls had receded, leaving this little spot of enchantment, while still farther on we could see that although the hills were still precipitous, yet they were evidently subsiding, and hope again revived.</p> 
               <p>The midday sun was pouring its rays into our little valley, and revelling in its warmth Florence and I spread our garments on its grassy banks, drying as best we could our drabbled skirts; while Arthur, relieving Sappho of his charge, took out the contents of the basket, and if ever hungry children and hungry dog enjoyed a feast we did then.</p> 
               <p>But now we must be moving again to find our way out. What was care or trouble to us now? we were as blithe as the lark, refreshed and rested; Florence and I singing loudly, while an occasional shout from Arthur made the old hills echo in their reverberations as we rambled on, quite forgetting we were still miserable wanderers, far away from home and knowing not whither we were drifting.</p> 
               <p>We had proceeded but a short distance when we were startled by an unusual sound. "What's that?" we all exclaimed, in breathless affright.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, nothing," said Arthur, in a moment ashamed of his alarm; "it is only the sighing of the wind, or the distant bark of a dog."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it is something else; don't you hear it again?" This time it was more like a shout, and looking upward in the direction of the sound, we saw high up on the<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5593-00000020"/> embankment, among the shrubs and bushes, a handkerchief waving.</p> 
               <p>In an instant all Florence's fears were gone; some one was suffering, some one needed help, that was enough; and, making a spring, she began clambering up the steep sides, catching from bush to bramble, till she reached the object of her search.</p> 
               <p>A gentleman had slipped and fallen, spraining his ankle. "Oh, dear, sir, what can I do for you? you are very much hurt," were the first words she uttered, as almost breathless she reached the top.</p> 
               <p>By this time Arthur and I were beside her, he also making every offer of assistance.</p> 
               <p>"You are kind, truly," said the gentleman,-with a twitch of pain,-"and can help me indeed; you see I am held fast. What should I have done if you had not been near? I am too far from home to be heard there, and but few pass this way. I might have suffered long and fearfully. Now, my young sir," turning to Arthur, "will you enter those old walls,"-pointing to a huge pile we had not noticed before, rising in solitary gloom above a point of rock on a curve of the ravine,-"and have them send from there a couple of men to carry me home, and I will remain your debtor for life."</p> 
               <p>Arthur was off in an instant. The stranger had spoken so cheerily, and to our young eyes looked so venerable and good, that involuntarily Florence and I, when Arthur had gone, drew nearer to him with affectionate confidence.</p> 
               <p>"And now, my little cherub," he said to Florence, as he looked pleasantly on her sweet face, "come<pb n=""/> nearer, and whisper in my ear where you came from to save me. Did you drop from that white cloud up yonder, or glide down on this sunbeam by my side?"</p> 
               <p>"Dear me! no, sir; nothing of the kind," was the answer, in all the directness of her simple innocence. "I came, we all came, by the path below."</p> 
               <p>"Then who may you be?"</p> 
               <p>"I am"-was the reply, with that attractive, innocent directness so peculiarly hers-"Florence Greyton, daughter of Sir Robert Greyton, of Greyton Hall; and Arthur is my brother."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, is that so?" and a pause followed, interrupted presently by Florence, who asked simply, "Do you know my papa?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, no-yes-hardly;" and as if to avoid further questioning, the gentleman turned to me, saying, "Where did you pick up this sturdy little maiden, Florence?"</p> 
               <p>"Pick her up?" she repeated. "Indeed, sir, I did not pick her up. My mamma invited her to come to me."</p> 
               <p>"What, then, is her name?"</p> 
               <p>"Olive, sir."</p> 
               <p>"A very pretty name! but has she no other?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, sir, I do not know. I believe not; have you, Olive?"</p> 
               <p>Pride for once overcame my awkward shyness. To be a nameless thing-it was too much! and with burning face I stammered out, "I have a name."</p> 
               <p>"I knew you had," was the response in such a kind, encouraging tone, that it acted as an instant soporific on my disturbed equanimity.</p> 
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5593-00000021"/> 
               <p>"Come then and tell me it yourself, my little girl," as he reached out his hand and drew me towards him.</p> 
               <p>"It is Olive Lacey," I said, with almost a sob.</p> 
               <p>"Lacey, Lacey, I know that name. Is your father Richard Lacey?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p> 
               <p>"And your father is Richard Lacey-strange, indeed! And your mother was-well, no matter. Your father I knew well-a fine fellow;" and after a moment's pause, he added, "Come nearer, child, and look right up in my face."</p> 
               <p>I had been looking aside and blushing, and casting my eyes everywhere, but now with a strange confidence, an almost yearning love, I raised my eyes to his. He had won my heart for ever and ever by these kind words.</p> 
               <p>Ah, they who are always smiled upon, and petted, and loved, are hardly aware of the tumult of joy, the living sense of gratitude, a word of appreciation, a simple smile of approval, may bring to the sensitive nature doubtful and uncertain of its own worth.</p> 
               <p>He looked long on my face, and then shook his head. "A nice, a good girl, I am sure, but how unlike!"</p> 
               <p>The attendants now came with all their appliances, when, raising their master on a chair, we were soon all en route for the old castle. We had never seen anything like it before. Gloomy enough it was, almost a ruin, the ivy hanging close over its gray walls; but there was such a grandeur about it, so much of mystery in its lonely isolation, that my imagination was fairly taken by storm.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>We passed through a low archway well secured by a portcullis at either end-those heavy spiked gates of the olden times made to crush or fasten in the invading foe-into a square or court from which you entered the habitable parts of the building.</p> 
               <p>The gentleman, amused at our wondering looks as they put him down in front of a closed door, asked if it was not a curious old place. "But pleasant to me for all that," he added. "It is my home, and some day I'll be proud to show you some of the old relics it contains. But now you will excuse my not inviting you in. I must have this unlucky leg at once cared for. I am in considerable pain; and then I have an aged invalid sister whom it will not do to alarm, and she would be alarmed did she suddenly see new faces. But I will take an early opportunity to see you again, and express my great gratitude, my noble little deliverers. So now, farewell."</p> 
               <p>Of course, before we left, we disclaimed all thought of gratitude or return for what we had done; we were only made too happy by having it in our power to have done what we had. "And can we not do something else? Can I not find a physician, sir?" said Arthur.</p> 
               <p>"No, no, nothing else. I am something of a doctor myself; at least, with the help of my good Philip here, I can manage this little matter. But about your getting home, my little friends-it is too far for you to walk; it is much farther by the road than by the pass you came through. And now, Thomas," turning to the other man, "get the jaunting-car, with the pony, ready at once, and bring it round."</p> 
               <p>We would rather have walked, but he would not<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5593-00000022"/> allow it; at least we must be driven to the main road, that was a couple of miles off.</p> 
               <p>This seemed to be a day of unusual adventure. We had left the car but a few minutes, and were walking along the road, when we saw, but a few steps ahead, what appeared to be a bundle of rags, but on nearer approach we descried rising from their midst the old patriarchal head of one we knew well. But it had never struck us with such a sense of reverence before; we had only noticed the wonderful combination of rags and patches. Now the sunlight shone on the white hair lying on the bent shoulders, and the long snowy beard, and for a moment the wayside beggar was transformed, to our eyes, into the embodiment of venerable dignity. Beside the old man lay stretched full length on the grass a strange, misshapen lad, snapping a whip and whistling a merry air with the keenest relish.</p> 
               <p>The pair were quite familiar. We had often seen them in their repeated visits to the Hall, where they were well cared for. Even my thrifty grandmother, who despised all of their race, treated them kindly if they ventured as far as the lodge.</p> 
               <p>"Old Doughty" was the prince of beggars, one of those inveterate professionals to the manner born, who think the world owes them a living, and who almost think they do you a service by giving you the opportunity to exercise the sweet virtues of charity. At any rate, poor old Doughty was not troubled with those nice sensibilities that might lead to delicate scruples. He simply took what was given, and, it might be, was only sorry it was not more.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>And his boy "Tim," or the "innocent," as he was called by the poor people,-which means half-witted, or idiotic,-was an excellent accompaniment-a poor little unfortunate he had picked up somewhere, carrying the boy about with him, and proving his business capacities by this farseeing care of the future. For old Doughty's supplies might have suffered by this increased demand, were it not for the growing and varied interest excited in the community by the accomplishments of this young hopeful.</p> 
               <p>"Tim" was anything but an "innocent." He was, in fact, one of the shrewdest little rascals that ever lived, his eye twinkling with an intelligence that few could mistake; but cunning and dissimulation were the lessons he learned with his earliest breath and to fool his betters was ever a source of supreme delight. Deformed and stunted, he had learned to make capital of his infirmities, sometimes exciting pity by his weakness, or again creating laughter by the contortions of his supple frame.</p> 
               <p>As Tim advanced in years he became a mine of wealth to the old man. The lad was a natural musician, and from his ever-ready fife could bring forth the wildest strains of native melody, wringing the hearts of the old to softened memories of dear ones gone; "of days and hopes long passed away, ochone, ochone!" or, in changing mood, his merry tunes would bring the lads and lasses to their feet, whirling about in the gay dances of their country.</p> 
               <p>This brought in half-pence and farthings in showers, and to these simple people it sometimes seemed as if the old man was becoming rich. "Nae, nae, dears,"<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5593-00000023"/> he would say, with the most insinuating sigh, "don't think so. It's he, the daft thing, keeps me the poor craythur I am. Lord bless ye's, dears, it takes all I can gather to put the bit in his mouth and cover his back, the ne'er-do-well! It was an evil day for poor old Doughty when he laid eyes on the wee, decrepit thing;" and thus he would whine, but no one believed him for all that.</p> 
               <p>The old man was so fully occupied looking over the contents of his many bags and bundles, that he did not notice us until right upon him, when, startled, he cried, "Up, Tim, and do yer reverence to the quality; here's the young master and the ladies."</p> 
               <p>In an instant, the young scamp was on his feet, flourishing his apology for a cap around his head, and throwing it down to the earth as he bent low in mock reverence.</p> 
               <p>There was mischief in his eye; we all laughed outright, we could not help it. His short, ludicrous figure, his great shaggy head, with the overflowing sense of fun revealed in his supple movements, excited our mirth irrepressibly.</p> 
               <p>"Where's your fife, Tim?" said Arthur at once; "we want some music."</p> 
               <p>"Sure and ye'll have it, masther," and the boy began to fumble among the many folds of his old tattered jacket, and plunge his hands frantically into the pockets of his many-colored unmentionables, exclaiming as he did so, "May I niver,-by gorry if it isn't gone. Och, musha, musha!"</p> 
               <p>"Gone!" screamed the old man in his piping voice, "gone! I'll have yer life, ye-ye-limb of-"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Och, murther, an' here it is!" cried the mischievous imp, as he drew the fife from the depths of the tattered mysteries that surrounded him, "here it is!" and, quite regardless of the foaming rage of the old man, he raised it with a cool professional air to his lips, saying, "An' now, masther and the young ladies, what'll ye's have?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, anything," we all cried; "anything you please."</p> 
               <p>And then he sent forth such a wail of melancholy, that I fear me Florence and I might soon have been in tears, when Arthur, interposing, called out, "Come, now, Tim, we don't want any of your dismals." Tim changed his style without loss of time, and gave us one of the liveliest of jigs, which soon sent Florence and myself spinning around like a pair of madcaps, Arthur clapping and cheering at the top of his voice.</p> 
               <p>The uproar and confusion I suppose bewildered the poor old man, for he soon cried out, "Tim, ye divil, stop that screeching."</p> 
               <p>Of course there was a sudden lull, but Arthur could not seemingly at once check the exuberance of his spirits, and the next best thing was to tease Tim; so he began by provokingly touching him lightly with his little whip on head or shoulders.</p> 
               <p>Tim bore this for awhile with laughing good humor, parrying the thrusts as best he could with his fife. Thus they had crossed the road, the one backing and the other following, until they reached the bank on the other side, when Tim, throwing down his fife, cried out, putting himself in position, "Come, now, young sir, let's have a fair 'bout with the natheral weapons."</p> 
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5593-00000024"/> 
               <p>"Hurrah!" answered Arthur, delighted. He had been well instructed in what is called the manly art of self-defense, and, squaring off, with scientific accuracy of aim he made a playful lunge at the young savage.</p> 
               <p>But, alas for recognized rules of combat,-we had scarcely realized what they were about, when a trip, a helpless roll, and Arthur disappeared down the steep embankment into the ditch below.</p> 
               <p>Florence and I stood horror-struck and screaming wildly; while the old man, starting from his lair, rushed across the road with garments streaming, and fell upon Tim with murderous intent.</p> 
               <p>"Bad luck to ye, ye murtherin' villain; ye unnatural baste, ye've ruined me entirely! How can I look the ould masther in the face agin! an' he was my best standby;" and with every fresh remembrance of what he had lost would come a renewed volley of thundering blows, till, the yells of the prostrate lad becoming fainter and fainter, it fairly seemed as if he were at his last gasp.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, don't, don't!" we cried, forgetting all else as we ran to them; "you will kill him; don't, don't!" And with our best efforts we tried to pull the old man off, when to our great astonishment a corner of the old gown was gently raised, and the horrid boy, thrusting out his shaggy head, winked knowingly at us, as if to say, "Ye're a pair of dupes, it's only a lark!"</p> 
               <p>Arthur now sprang up the bank, shaking the dirt and dust from him, hardly willing to admit that <emph>his</emph> had been anything but a lark also, and telling the old man he was not a bit hurt, it was only fun, tried at once to extricate Tim. He had not been enlightened by our by-play, and really thought the boy was hurt. The<pb n=""/> poor old man, completely exhausted by his impotent effort, could scarcely drag himself back to the old bags and bundles, while Arthur with benevolent pity was trying to comfort the artful little rascal at his feet.</p> 
               <p>"Get up, now, Tim," he said, coaxingly, "get up; I'll help you."</p> 
               <p>"Och, yer honor, I'm kilt; the ould brute has broken my bones, an' what is a poor craythur like meself to do? If I had but enough to get a bit of plaster or a crutch. Ochone!"</p> 
               <p>"I'll give you money, plenty of money, Tim, only try to get up; here it is," and the contents of one pocket went into the outstretched hand. A great struggle, and Tim wriggled across the road a little way; but his groans and sighs continued until both pockets of his dupe were emptied, and then he managed to throw himself into the place he had left, a great relief indeed to all of us, for Florence and I had again been most woefully deceived, and thought he might die on our hands. Sappho seemed to be the only being of any sense or penetration among us; he appeared fully to understand what was going on. We could scarcely keep him from flying at Tim and tearing him to pieces, as if he thought him truly an unmitigated scapegrace.</p> 
               <p>Quiet being finally restored, we left amid a shower of blessings,-"May the heavens be yer bed! may glory be with ye!"</p> 
               <p>And we had the further satisfaction of knowing that Tim was quite restored to health and spirits by the repeated whoops and halloos that reached us for some distance on our way.</p> 
               <p>"Of course you will not say anything to papa or<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5593-00000025"/> mamma about this," said Arthur, a little nervously. "You know they would not like our speaking to such people."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, dear, no," both of us loyally exclaimed, although it was exceedingly doubtful if Florence could restrain herself so much; "we will not say a word."</p> 
               <p>"Now, if you <emph>do</emph>, Florence!" was the threatening rejoinder.</p> 
               <p>"Upon my word and honor I will not. You are always so afraid," she added, with a little pique; but in a moment after she was overflowing with the remembrance of the merry things Tim had said. "Oh, it was such fun, such fun!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, that is the way it will be," said Arthur, fretfully; "it will all come out, just like you!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
               <head type="sub">OLD ACQUAINTANCE.</head> 
               <p>WE were not back to the Hall any too soon. In a short time we should undoubtedly have been missed. The different parties had returned, and the dressing-bell for dinner was sounding.</p> 
               <p>We glided in unnoticed, and soon, under the skillful manipulations of Florence's maid, she and I were made presentable in case we should be sent for.</p> 
               <p>As we expected, during the early evening all three of us were sent for to the family parlor to say good-night<pb n=""/> night to Sir Robert and her ladyship. "And how has my beauty spent her day?" were the cheerful words of Sir Robert, as he kissed his little girl.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, papa, such times, such delightful times!" she exclaimed, her sweet face glowing with all she had to tell. Arthur moved uneasily; but she was so full of what she had to say about this gentleman who had so taken her fancy, that she forgot all else. "He was so handsome, so pleasant, and so grateful to us for saving his life!"</p> 
               <p>"What, what! Saving his life? What does this mean?" was the astonished question.</p> 
               <p>And now Arthur came forward to explain.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, that was fine; and what may be the gentleman's name?"</p> 
               <p>"I think, sir, it is Massarene. I heard the servants say this as we went into the castle yard."</p> 
               <p>"Massarene, Massarene," repeated his father, a frown evidently gathering on the usually pleasant face. "Massarene-well, my boy, I am happy you have had it in your power to serve any one, but-but-" with increasing severity, "I thought my commands were that you should not enter the premises or grounds of any one with whom I was unacquainted?"</p> 
               <p>"I know, papa; but what could I do?"</p> 
               <p>And now Lady Grace interposed, and thought Arthur ought rather to be praised than blamed for what he had done.</p> 
               <p>"Well, we will let this pass, but I hope it will not be repeated."</p> 
               <p>Florence, disappointed, eagerly cried out, "Oh, papa, don't say so; we were invited to the old castle<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5593-00000026"/> to hear all about it, and he is such a dear old gentleman!"</p> 
               <p>"Ha, ha, ha!" with a sudden turn of good humor. "That's rich! Dear old gentleman! why, he is not as old as I am by some years."</p> 
               <p>"Why, papa, I thought you said you did not know him," was the wondering child's quick reply.</p> 
               <p>There was no answer for a moment. It was evident, however, that something was wrong, for the angry glance came again as he almost thrust her from him, saying, "You are entirely too forward, Florence," and to Lady Grace, "cannot something be done to restrain this child?"</p> 
               <p>Poor Florence, as sensitive to blame as to praise from her father, turned away, her great eyes filling with tears.</p> 
               <p>But tears in the eyes of Florence were more than Sir Robert could well bear, and calling her instantly back, he caressingly apologized for his hastiness.</p> 
               <p>"I did not intend to say I did not know Mr. Massarene; but we have been long estranged. A difficulty in our young hot-headed days separated us; since then I have seen or heard so little of him, that I had almost forgotten such a person existed. I do remember some years ago hearing he had gone into absolute retirement; shut himself up in the old Abbey-Glen Abbey, as we used to call it-and would not see any one. But I am glad he feels some interest in my little girl, and happy indeed that she feels such an interest in him. I once loved him as myself. I still love him, and will always venerate him for the high character he has sustained. You and Florence," speaking to Arthur,<pb n=""/> "are at perfect liberty to enjoy his friendship, only I cannot see him."</p> 
               <p>We knew there was some mystery, but none felt at liberty to ask questions, and with a pleasant goodnight we went to our own rooms; highly delighted with the way matters had turned out.</p> 
               <p>The time had come for me to leave. Florence was sobbing, "Oh, mamma, why cannot Olive always live with us?" Even Arthur looked sorry. Sir Robert stroked my hair as he kissed me good-by, saying I must come often to see Florence; every day, if I chose.</p> 
               <p>But Lady Grace put in a prudent reservation; she was sure Florence would wish to see me often, and she, Lady Grace, would send a servant for me to the lodge whenever I was needed.</p> 
               <p>There was quite a serious time when I returned home. I cried and mourned with a sullen persistency, until my grandmother, not much given to tender sentimentalism, became angry and scolded me to silence, I sobbing, "I will be good, I will stop crying; but I do so love Florence!"</p> 
               <p>"Tut, tut, child," was the answer, but in a softened tone, "this will not do. Miss Florence is a dear, sweet young lady, but her way through life will take her far from you; she will soon forget, and so must you. I blame myself; I ought not to have let you have a glimpse of this world, so different from our own; it only leads to discontent. I well remember, saucy girl that I was, how poor and desolate my mother's cottage seemed when I came from the grand folks, and how all her kind words fell listless on my ear."</p> 
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5593-00000027"/> 
               <p>"But grandmother," said I, interested, "the lodge does not seem desolate, it looks to me sweet and pretty." And how could it seem otherwise, with its scent of roses and woodbine and the shining cleanliness of everything about it, while my grandmother herself, in this her vigorous old age, would have added dignity to any abode.</p> 
               <p>From this time it was understood to be a forbidden subject, this about Florence or the Hall; nevertheless, I did not forget. Walter was my only comfort; to him I could talk and secretly tell all my feelings.</p> 
               <p>In a week or two we fell into our old ways, I doing what I was called to do under grandmother's instructions during the day, and in the evening being taught by Walter.</p> 
               <p>Thus weeks went by; it was getting into the short days of winter, and not a word or message from the Hall. Carriages passed often through the great gate; but I did not see anything of Florence. Still my dream went on. In all my silent hours she was with me, and I was living again in that atmosphere of light and beauty which seemed her natural surrounding. I did not wonder at not hearing from her, or go into any imaginings why it was so; I felt content in what I had enjoyed, as one would with a jewel they never expected to wear, but considered themselves inexpressibly rich in its possession.</p> 
               <p>At length, early one afternoon, a summons came from the Hall for my grandmother. Even then there were no speculations raised in my mind as to what this might mean; I let her quietly depart without a thought, and I went on, seated at the little diamond-shaped<pb n=""/> window, with my morsel of sewing, which my thrifty kinswoman always insisted should be in my hands when not otherwise employed.</p> 
               <p>She had dressed herself carefully, as she always did when summoned to the Hall; and I could not but think as I cast my eyes up the long avenue and saw her still upright figure moving slowly on, that she looked about as grand as any of the fine folks there. The wardrobe of the old mistress, had fallen to her share, and the well-preserved silk dress and mantle added dignity to her naturally fine presence.</p> 
               <p>Her return was delayed until the old elms of the avenue began to throw out their darkening shadows; and when she did come back, and sat down in our little parlor, her face looked more care-worn than I had ever noticed it before.</p> 
               <p>I was always somewhat in dread of my grandmother. She had not spoken, but I ventured to draw near and say, "May I not untie your bonnet and take off your cloak, grandmother?"</p> 
               <p>"No, dear," was the unusually kind reply, "I have a little farther to go yet."</p> 
               <p>"You have not had your tea, and it is getting late," I again made bold to remark.</p> 
               <p>"That is true, child, but I have not the heart to eat till this matter is settled. Do you know, Olive,-" with a sudden burst of feeling,-"they want to have you and keep you at the Hall."</p> 
               <p>"Me, grandmother?" I cried in unutterable astonishment.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, child." It was some time before she could command her voice to speak, and I answered, "But<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5593-00000028"/> I will not go there, grandmother. I will not leave you."</p> 
               <p>And then she drew me to her, and talked with me with the most loving tenderness, and I came to know, young as I was, that she would suffer a great deal more than I would or could in this parting. "You are my all, Olive; but it is not our present feelings, it is your future good we are to consider, and it is this takes me to my wise, good friend, Mr. Massarene, for advice."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Massarene, grandmother? Why that is the name of the gentleman who said that we saved his life."</p> 
               <p>"Saved his life?" she repeated. "Saved his life? Is the child demented?"</p> 
               <p>And then I tried to stammer out an explanation.</p> 
               <p>"And why did I not hear this before?" was the angry inquiry.</p> 
               <p>"Why, why, grandmother, "I began to cry, frightened, hardly knowing where the wrong was, but aware that something was the matter-"you know you would not allow me to speak about any of these things," and Walter, coming in, corroborated my statement with telling energy.</p> 
               <p>"True, true, children, this was ever my way; ready with the hasty word, closing people's mouths, and then angry if they did not open them. I see it all now; there's none to seek my counsel;" and she sighed, "but, I fear me, it is too late to mend."</p> 
               <p>It would seem the advice she sought favored the change; for, before long, I was duly transferred to the Hall to be educated, trained, and reared as companion to the daughter of the house.</p> 
               <p>It seemed (although I only learned this in afteryears<pb n=""/> years) that Florence had conceived such a deep-rooted affection for me that no efforts that were made could eradicate it. She had been taken among friends and relatives in England and distant parts of the country to divert her mind; but, never used to self-denial in the slightest matter, the child, it was found, must have her way, or the consequences might be painful; her life was so made up of emotion that her parents became anxious about her health, and after due deliberation this proposition had been made, and her little playmate was restored.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A LEAF FROM IRELAND'S HISTORY.</head> 
               <p>LET me still solicit the patient forbearance of the reader who has followed me thus far, while I pause to make a few extracts from the history of this period, before entering upon the main incidents of the next ten years of my life.</p> 
               <p>It is the habit, I had almost said the fashion, of our English-speaking nations to represent the Irish character in the most preposterous light. While we know that education is the great leveler, and that the cultivated of all countries become much alike in modes of communication and habits of thought, the Irish are apparently made the sole exception to this rule. In the works of "distinguished" authors,-travelers, novelists,<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5593-00000029"/> etc.,-we find such phrases put into the mouths of educated ladies and gentlemen as might be expected from the peasant or workman, and the manners and language of the stable transferred to the nobleman's drawing-room.</p> 
               <p>So, from our travelers, we hear little of spacious cities, with their fine buildings, parks, colleges, and flourishing commerce, or of thriving towns, fine roads, and well-cultured lands, or of noble rivers, whose waters glisten with busy sails, and whose banks are studded with the tasteful residences of opulent proprietors. They prefer the description (perhaps intermixed with some enthusiastic admiration of picturesque scenery, of bewitching lakes, grand ocean views, etc.) of the miserable potato-patch, the mud-hovels, the squalor, filth, and beggary of the Irish peasants. These themes are dwelt upon until the imperfectly instructed almost incline to think there is nothing else to be seen in Ireland. And the native-born, away from the influences of home, and, it may be, somewhat timid and not over-patriotic, begin to be ashamed of their country, and to feel almost like apologizing for their nativity. If there is any loophole of escape, it will be caught at; it may be through some remote ancestor, who has been fortunate enough to hail from some other clime, let it be Phnicia, Egypt, or anywhere else; and then, happily, they are Phnician-Irish, Egyptian-Irish, or any other Irish, rather than of the true Milesian type.</p> 
               <p>The Irish are called, by their calumniators, turbulent, vindictive, and unmanageable. Without admitting that this is or is not the case, let us say it is fortunate we seldom find men unmitigatedly bad. Irish nature<pb n=""/> is human nature, and the causes which lead to certain results are about the same with them as with others.</p> 
               <p>The Irish are a conquered people, and have been ruled by their conquerors over six hundred years, and what are the consequences? We find the answer to this question oftener in the writings of their enemies than of their friends; doubtless the juster judgment would be found in the line between the two extremes.</p> 
               <p>During these six hundred years many efforts have been made by the people to free themselves from a very galling yoke, but one after another these have failed. Perhaps no country ever received less sympathy in its struggles. There could be many reasons given for this coldness, but the one sufficient and prominent is the want of success. Success throws a halo of glory over efforts which the want of it would sink to the level of contempt. All history attests this truth.</p> 
               <p>Again, if successful, the wrongs which led to the struggle are forgotten; if the effort, on the contrary, be a futile one, these wrongs become a rankling sore that cannot be healed. Thus, with the people of Ireland, has been transmitted, from generation to generation, a gloomy legacy of hate. But the worst effect has been that produced upon the character of the nation. Irritable, reckless, impatient of rule, they are a living proof that events have quite as profound a bearing on the characteristics of races as of individuals.</p> 
               <p>But it may be said that England and Scotland were also conquered countries, and were ruled by their conquerors for centuries with the same contempt for their laws, language, and institutions as was exhibited by the conquerors of Ireland. Why not the same results?<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5593-00000030"/> Simply because of fortuitous circumstances. England became the seat of government and the home of its invaders; a complete union of interests and races took place. In time, its monarchs, its princes and nobles, were natives of the soil; and the land and name, once despised, became the pride of conqueror and conquered. So with Scotland; marriage and intermarriage gradually made of those who dwelt upon the borders one people. In their bitter warfares, border feuds, and national animosities they were still as one family, united by natural bonds that could not be severed.</p> 
               <p>Not so with Ireland; in her isolated position she was a stranger to her rulers, yet she must be ruled. So the favorite at court for reward of services, the spendthrift lord, the needy adventurer, were well provided for out of Ireland's misfortunes. Any one who would hold the reins tight enough might hope to be happily appointed governor or viceroy of the king, to look after the affairs of that miserable country, to raise money for his majesty, and to maintain home authority. There was neither sympathy, common interest, nor affection to be cultivated with the inhabitants. Those who went thither were as strangers and aliens in the land. When they had attained a certain object, and received all they could hope to obtain, they would leave the country forever. A present footing was all they needed; and with a strong force to back their efforts, they found little difficulty in creating dissension among the native, half-barbaric chiefs. A subtle policy was maintained, in which the real promoters of feuds or outbreaks enacted the part of apparent mediators,<pb n=""/> and came in, thereby, for the lion's share of whatever booty was in question. This policy was continued even down to the days of Queen Elizabeth, as is evident from a certain letter of her majesty's minister to the then viceroy of Ireland, in which he says, "In these disorders are our safety." "They must soon," he continues, "acquire power, consequence, and riches, and the inhabitants may seek to erect themselves into an independent state;" therefore, he infers, in these internal jealousies and divisions lies the only safety.</p> 
               <p>Later came religious animosities; and, in their train, obnoxious laws and cruel persecutions. Then the demon of discord, uniting with whoever was in the ascendency, inaugurated the cry of "No faith with the party down." Were that party Catholic, then no faith with the heretic; were it Protestant, then no faith with the Catholic.</p> 
               <p>But we will leave these early times, where, as in the beginnings of all communities, we find the quick emotions and stronger passions have their sway, and come to a later period, where we expect that with the progress of intelligence these rudimental ills will disappear, and a more thoughtful wisdom guide our councils.</p> 
               <p>In this year, 1782, by the united determination of the people, without reference to sect, condition, or creed, a great moral victory had been achieved.</p> 
               <p>In the strong vitality of the native character, and in the immense recuperative powers of this beautiful island, she had outlived in a great measure the accumulated difficulties that had so long retarded her progress, and riches, prosperity, and intelligence were abundant; not so widespread by any means as they should be, but<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5593-00000031"/> still enough so to give the people a right to demand a yet further lifting off of their burdens.</p> 
               <p>In protecting the commerce and trade of England and Scotland, Ireland, with her activities and greater facilities for these, was found to be in the way. The lesser must give way to the greater, and so she was crippled; her most valuable exports were so hampered and restricted, as to be rendered almost valueless. So with some of the most flourishing trades; they were so burdened that they fell into disuse. And now they said these burdens must be removed. And they were removed. And they said, also, "We must have our own free parliament, independent of British legislation; we must be judged by our own laws without the appeal to a higher tribunal." And even this was granted them; and there was a general rejoicing all over the land. The gentleman of leisure, the doctor, the lawyer, the merchant, mechanic, farmer, and peasant, all, all rejoiced.</p> 
               <p>But alas! alas! this universal joy was rather premature. There were the promises, but not, as yet, the realization of these promises. These concessions had been forced, and they were felt to be so by the mass of the people; therefore they failed to elicit that gratitude they would otherwise have done.</p> 
               <p>In this year, also, the revolt of the American colonies was drawing to a successful close. The French revolution was in fierce progress. Thrones were tottering. The divine right of royal lines was being doubted, and a stronger faith in the power of self-government was fast gaining ground. Therefore the home government dare not turn a deaf ear to the reasonable demands of<pb n=""/> its Irish subjects. But government had still the power to madden, irritate, and put obstacles in the way; and if, in the progress of my narrative, I may be obliged to relate some things that, to the just-minded, may seem incredible, I can only refer them to the statements of the times, wherein they will find mention of still grosser outrages, that I would not even dare to relate.</p> 
               <p>"I have," said Lord Moria, in his speech in the English house of lords, "a knowledge of these tortures and cruelties of which I speak, so revolting to all our ideas in the present civilized state of the world; and, I must say, I have seen the most disgusting tyranny in Ireland that ever any nation groaned under."</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">LIFE AT GREYTON HALL.</head> 
               <p>FIVE, yes, six more years passed contentedly away-six quiet years in which there were few events worthy of record, yet their influence in the after-circumstances of my life was keenly and deeply felt.</p> 
               <p>Sir Robert and Lady Grace fulfilled every promise made to my grandmother,-nay, even more. I was not only cared for as a favored dependent, but almost or quite as though I were a daughter of the house. Florence knew no half-way measures in her generous and unselfish love for me; I was educated under the same masters, clothed as expensively, and I joined in all her<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5593-00000032"/> amusements; she would have it so, playfully introducing me as her twin-sister. Were we not born on the same day? she would say in her loving persistency.</p> 
               <p>We became more closely knit together, perhaps, because of the opposite qualities which characterized us, and were mutually benefited by the contact of contrasting dispositions. I unconsciously caught from her delicate grace a certain pliancy, while she gathered from my native obduracy of temper a firmness lacking in her own. Ours was indeed a happy, thoughtless girlhood, with no fears for the future. And why should we fear? Health, joy, and sunshine, were all we knew; and did a little cloud at any time drift into our horizon it only made the light more intense when it disappeared. Youth does not analyze, it simply desires and accepts; it is only in later years the emotions born of our susceptibilities are fully developed; and then it is that, accordingly as our capacity for nice distinctions is sharpened and quickened by the growth of the intellect, so will be the acuteness of our sense of suffering, if suffering comes.</p> 
               <p>But, at present, we were in the happy state of unquestioning acceptance; at least I was. I soon became accustomed to that which was so fully accorded me, and seldom questioned my right to the gift.</p> 
               <p>Seldom, I have said; yet, even in the midst of my happy thoughtlessness, there were moments, only occasional, however, when I was made to feel that, though one of the household, I was not one of the family. Lady Grace, I conceived, did not like me, and would rather not have had me there. But in this I might be mistaken; her ladyship was not demonstrative. Her<pb n=""/> temperament was cold, formal, and precise; even to her daughter, who was her idol, she seldom showed marks of warm affection; but she was just and highly conscientious; and I could remember so many of her acts of kindness that I was always ashamed of myself when I got into these doubting moods, and would make every effort to drive off such ungrateful thoughts.</p> 
               <p>Arthur, in our days of early roaming, had become so accustomed to the society of Florence and myself, that, apparently, he could not altogether abandon it. His dogs and ponies had lost their interest; and he so managed it that many of our studies were recited together; indeed, in some of them, we had the same masters from the city; and, in the long winter evenings, with our books and lamp, we would sit round the little table, and, under the supervision of tutor or governess, prepare our lessons for the next day; or else, in the late summer twilight, take our seats on the grass and work away until time for rest.</p> 
               <p>We liked it much; never tiring; for where Florence was there was an endless variety. She was quick as thought in mind and action. Arthur was slow; it was difficult for him to comprehend; and when she had dashed through with her lessons he would still have to plod on; this irritating him, no doubt, there would be sharp words if she disturbed him, which she usually did, in her light, airy way, at such times, and then the war began. "You are such an incessant chatterbox, Florence!" and "You are such a stupid, Arthur!" till Miss Lucas would interfere, lecturing Florence on the impropriety of a young lady using such language, and declaring she was afraid she would have to report to mamma.</p> 
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5593-00000033"/> 
               <p>"Oh, do not, dear Miss Lucas!" would be the penitential cry.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I wish you would," Arthur would say. But I fear had the lady done so she would have created a very uncomfortable state of affairs for herself; for although the lad was at times disposed to be sarcastic and severe himself, yet he would allow no one else that liberty. He loved his sister dearly, and thought her all but perfect. With myself he got along more quietly; I was not so much in his way. That silence so natural to me stood my shield; I could be angry, provoked, and blame severely, but fortunately I could keep it all to myself, and then it would be forgotten without mischief being done; but Florence, in the artless singleness of her nature, knew no such self-repression.</p> 
               <p>In this six years we had been much with Mr. Massarene, and learned to love him as our best friend. Lady Betty had told us all about him. And this reminds me that I have not yet introduced her ladyship to the reader.</p> 
               <p>Lady Betty Nugent, a maiden lady of strong character, was Sir Robert's aunt, his mother's youngest sister. She was now past her three-score years and ten, but still strong and vigorous in mind and body. Many called her eccentric; but her eccentricities consisted more in living out her own true self-hood than in anything else; there was nothing artificial or made up about her ladyship. Blunt, plain, strong, she had no sympathy with weakness, nor patience with any mediatory measures of conciliation. "A wrong is a wrong," she would say, "and anything you may urge cannot make it right;"<pb n=""/> and such invariably would be the testy old lady's last word in an argument.</p> 
               <p>An ardent lover of her country, she would hear to no apology for the stranger's rule therein. There was but one thing to do, "Drive them out! Do you think I would make terms with the robber who sought to force my door and take possession of my house? No; it would be compounding a felony, Sir Robert!"</p> 
               <p>Poor Sir Robert would be in despair whenever he ventured on this disputed ground. Even though one-sided, and judging mostly from her prejudices, there was so much directness and so much energy in her arguments that it was difficult to put them aside.</p> 
               <p>She loved her nephew, but she looked upon him as rather pusillanimous. "He is not a Nugent," was her favorite remark, "or he could not be ruled as he is." She did not like Lady Grace. "She is a prig," said the old lady, her nose becoming more elevated and the lines around her mouth more tightly compressed as she reiterated, "She is a prig!"</p> 
               <p>But this dislike could be very easily accounted for. Lady Grace was an Englishwoman; and, to Lady Betty's mind, nothing good could come out of that country.</p> 
               <p>Neither was Lady Grace partial to her Irish aunt; she too had her prejudices; but for her want of partiality in this instance she had some reason. Lady Betty could be very disagreeable when she chose; and, it must be admitted, she too often chose. And then Lady Betty had seen fit, in religious matters, to join herself with the Dissenters; and, to the mind of Lady Grace, this was about as serious a falling off<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5593-00000034"/> though she had lapsed into Catholicism. "It is a dangerous precedent," she had said to the rector's appreciative wife, "this thinking for ourselves, and deciding for ourselves away from established authority. It may do for the common people; it amuses and satisfies them; but for us, with the eyes of the world upon us, it is dangerous, very dangerous!"</p> 
               <p>Of course Lady Betty had few intimates, and necessarily lived much alone in her old dilapidated home by the sea. In this home she had spent her early childhood; and now she was wearing out in it the few remaining days left to her.</p> 
               <p>But she was neither despondent nor unhappy. There was such a fierce energy in her character, such a powerful antagonism to all that she considered wrong, that her mind, ever active, still working, dispelled all loneliness, while it brightened up the old dark chambers with the phantom opponents with whom she was ever battling.</p> 
               <p>Her income was limited; but she managed to keep up the old state with all its paraphernalia. The old family coach, servants, and liveries, with the diamonds and the velvet train, if ever she felt disposed to honor Sir Robert's drawing-room by her presence on any special occasion, were all made to do duty.</p> 
               <p>With all her warfare with the world, and her anger at its ways and doings, there was one love had crept into her soul unawares which had its own softening influence. She loved Florence, the sweet Florence, with all the love of her heart. Of Arthur she was proud. "Yes, he will redeem the honor of his family," said the old lady, eyeing the lad approvingly, when<pb n=""/> sometimes in our talk he dilated with boyish enthusiasm on his love of Ireland and Ireland's people. To me she was always kind; but Florence was her darling. Perhaps in the young girl she discerned another phase of that frank fearlessness of character which was her own distinguishing peculiarity. "She has the Nugent blood in her veins," said Lady Betty, triumphantly. But she did not perceive the essential point of difference,-with Florence these spontaneous impulses so freely expressed, that singleness of purpose that knew no guile, were all influenced by the one motive-power of her nature,-love,-true, genuine, human love.</p> 
               <p>But it would be doing Lady Betty injustice to insinuate that she was entirely controlled by the opposite qualities. She was too apt to judge hastily, and not always wisely; she allowed her better nature to lie dormant, and made use of her discernment rather to see faults than reasons for pity and forgiveness; but her intentions were right; it was in outward acts she failed.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Massarene was one of her few favorites. "Only he lacks spirit," she would say, "though he worked hard, I admit, in that corrupt parliament, which all of you, no doubt," looking round on our three listening faces, "hear talked of as the 'bulwark of Irish liberty.' Pshaw! But what could he do against English pretension, English gold? he was disgusted, he was disheartened, and left. But I would have let them tear my eyes out before I would have succumbed to their injustice; yes, that I would!"</p> 
               <p>And none of us doubted she would.</p> 
               <p>"And then to think of his shutting himself up in that old rookery to take care of a mad sister!"</p> 
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5593-00000035"/> 
               <p>"Mad! Oh, Aunt Betty, Mr. Massarene says she is an invalid."</p> 
               <p>"Invalid! fiddlesticks! she's as mad as a March hare, and fancies herself the Virgin Mary, or some other wonderful personage, and he humors her in it they say. But she was always a feather-brained thing; when we were girls together her head was turned with vanity; and then she must go to Rome to worship the pope and idols there. Probably she tired of praying and counting her beads; at any rate, the result was, she married some Italian prince, who proved to be a scamp and deserted her. The little wit she ever had then left her, and penniless, starving and alone, her brother found her in the Eternal City; pope, priest, and all having forgotten such a one had ever been; but he brought her back, and has devoted himself to her ever since."</p> 
               <p>"Poor lady," said the sympathetic Florence, almost in tears, "and how good of him!"</p> 
               <p>"Well, as for that, he owed her much; she was enough older to be his mother, and when he was left a helpless infant she was as a mother to him."</p> 
               <p>"Then it is good in him to remember it so gratefully, isn't it, Aunt Betty?"</p> 
               <p>"So it is, my child," was the answer in her gentlest voice. She always spoke gently to Florence when speaking to her personally.</p> 
               <p>These were indeed hours of unmixed pleasure to me, as I sat with the others in that dark, wainscoted room, listening to the firm voice of the old lady, when disposed to talk to us, and the continuous dash of the white wave as it foamed around the rocks beneath the windows.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>And how much we heard there that we would not have heard elsewhere, nor would have been permitted to listen to now had the theme of our conversation and the influence it had upon us been known.</p> 
               <p>Lady Betty was an uncompromising rebel; and love for her country and for its freedom burned as a flame within her breast. She had studied its language, and in her native tongue had read its traditions,-its histories,-the poems of its ancient bards, with all their fervent mixture of war, love, and wrong.</p> 
               <p>These she would translate for us, in all the rich abundance of their own figurative rhetorical exuberance, till our enthusiasm was roused to the highest pitch, or again, when a deeper pathos moved the song, the melting tones of its agonized sorrow would tear our young hearts with an anguish of tenderness and pity we had never before known.</p> 
               <p>"Aunt Betty," Arthur would say, in the height of his enthusiasm, "I will be a soldier, and help make my beautiful country what it might be if free from this self-imposed thraldom."</p> 
               <p>"No, my lad, the Greytons never were soldiers; and denunciatory and uncompromising as I may appear, I am not for the spilling of blood, or for having men meet as wild beasts to bite and tear each other in order to right a difficulty. But you may serve your country in a much better way, if you and all like you prepare in the honest uprightness of your hearts to meet the arguments of those self-seeking sycophants who persuade the unthinking, and those afar off that do not know us, and those whose interest it is to have it so, that it is best for poor Ireland to remain as it is. Meet<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5593-00000036"/> them and confound them on their own ground; let that be your work, my boy."</p> 
               <p>These were dangerous sentiments to instil into the mind of the coming representative of the loyal house of Greyton, and would have caused great confusion in its household had it been known; but there was nothing in the society at the Hall, nor in the spoken sentiments of his parents, to call for frankness of expression on political matters; indeed, they had ever been studiously avoided before us, and therefore our conclaves continued unchecked. Arthur was now approaching manhood, with few fixed ideas on these matters; but his feelings were roused, and his sympathies, it must be admitted, were all with his country. Whether he was of the material to make a determined stand for its benefit had yet to be proven; but we went on, day after day, in our afternoon freedom to gallop our three miles to Darkcliff, as we playfully called it, to place ourselves under the spell of Lady Betty's fascinations.</p> 
               <p>And Darkcliff was a most appropriate name; for, truly, everything was dark around Lady Betty's little domain. If we left the Hall in the glowing sunshine, and raced along the hedge-bound roads, and by the meadows, with the afternoon sun brightening the many colors of the wild flowers, buttercups and daisies, yet, as we neared the close, heavy-studded gate, and entered within its walls, all was dusk and shadow again.</p> 
               <p>The old trees, stunted by the ocean breeze, closed their heavy leaves and tendrils close around the eaves, gables, and parapets of the ancient manor; even the little piece of ground facing the sea was darkened in this continuous shroud; only under this low mass of<pb n=""/> foliage could there be caught occasional glimpses of the moving waters beneath, to lighten up the perpetual gloom.</p> 
               <p>But I liked this darkness, and the rolling of the waters, and the hazy mists forever rising; they suited my mood, and threw about the place a dreaminess and mystery I loved. Still, I knew there was little of shadow or mystery around our straightforward Lady Betty; but in the quiet and darkness, listening, listening, the imagination could take flight and dream and wonder, and shape out its own world of mysteries.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">AN OLD CASTLE, AND ITS INMATES.</head> 
               <p>IN the early days of our visits to Glen Abbey we had not seen anything of Mr. Massarene's sister; and, although Lady Betty had raised our youthful curiosity in regard to her, we were, of course, too considerate to let this appear.</p> 
               <p>With Mr. Massarene we had become quite intimate. The venerable aspect he first presented to our young eyes had quite worn away. We were charmed with his gracious manner, his commanding appearance, and always anticipated our visits to his place with great pleasure. He had shown us many of the mysteries of the ancient edifice: its dark prisons, its unroofed towers, through whose mouldering loopholes wary<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5593-00000037"/> watch was kept in the olden time, and from which the archers sent forth their weapons of death on the approaching foe, or guarded the persons of the goodly abbot and his followers should they choose to disport themselves on the greensward of the valley below. But the religious uses of the old castle had long since passed away, and in later times it had been, as far as possible, the peaceful residence of the lords of the soil. But farther than the few apartments appropriated to Mr. Massarene's individual use we had not yet penetrated.</p> 
               <p>One day he said to us, "You have not seen-would you like to see the few pictures left in the old gallery? Come, follow me."</p> 
               <p>"I am very sorry," said Arthur, as we passed through some long-disused passages, "to find you still continue lame, and cannot yet do without a cane; your injury must have been more severe than you supposed."</p> 
               <p>"No; you mean the slide on the precipice? Well, that was bad enough, but a few weeks got me over it. This lameness is of many years' standing, the result of a youthful episode." And, seeing our questioning looks, he added, with a smile, "Perhaps I may some day tell you all about it."</p> 
               <p>We were now in the gallery,-a long, narrow apartment, lined with the dark arbutus wood, the native growth of the country, whose dusky hue made the place seem gloomy. There were many old family portraits on its walls, dignified, austere, and unsmiling, as though questioning our right to be there; but there were other pictures to take our attention, exquisite gems, well calculated to attract even the uninitiated, and our host seemed to enjoy much the crude criticisms he heard.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>I had wandered on alone, charmed, but incapable of expressing what I felt, as the others could so engagingly, when most unexpectedly I came to a painting so different from all the rest that it held me spell-bound; and I gazed awe-struck, in a transport of admiration, with my whole soul in my eyes, till tears overflowing, I found them coursing down my face. Ashamed, indeed, I hastily wiped them away, when I saw Mr. Massarene standing by my side.</p> 
               <p>"Ah! I see you appreciate this wonderful work, Olive," he said, putting his hand gently on my shoulder; "you must have something of the artist's soul."</p> 
               <p>I could now have sobbed aloud. "This is an original," he continued; "the work of that good old monk, Fra Angelica; and truly," he said, looking up reverently at the forms before him, "no waking eye could ever have looked on the faces he portrays; it must have been in dreams or visions he beheld the ideal loveliness caught, as by inspiration, upon his canvas. In the solitude of his cell, in lonely hours of meditation, such beings, stepping over the border-land, must have revealed themselves, the loving types of what we deem purely imaginative conceptions."</p> 
               <p>My attention, taken from the painting, was now held by the glow and enthusiasm of the speaker; he seemed to make the beautiful creation a part of himself; and Arthur and Florence, coming up, became as much absorbed as myself in all he said, as we grouped around him.</p> 
               <p>At this moment we were startled by an unusual noise at the extremity of the gallery, and looking quickly up<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5593-00000038"/> we saw a hand putting aside a piece of hanging tapestry, from beneath which a tall figure, most fantastically attired, followed by a shorter one equally strange in appearance, came towards us.</p> 
               <p>In an instant we conjectured this must be the Lady Annastene we had heard so much about, and the other person, who was dressed as a nun, was probably an attendant.</p> 
               <p>We were, however, much alarmed, and could not avoid showing a little trepidation, and Mr. Massarene was evidently annoyed. "I might have known this!" we heard him mutter.</p> 
               <p>The lady slowly approached with great dignity. There was something almost regal in her style and demeanor. She bore a strong resemblance to her brother, or rather he to her,-there were the same high features, the same fair complexion; but she was now in extreme old age, wasted and pale, her face almost ghastly in its pallor; but her eyes, bright and dazzling, burned as though lighted from a fire beneath.</p> 
               <p>Her dress was peculiar, probably one of those in which she had shone triumphantly in the days of her power, when admiring eyes followed her every movement, in those gay saloons. A rich, embroidered silk of brilliant color, with flowing train, swept the floor; and on her shoulders was thrown a short scarlet mantle caught by a heavy chain, from which was suspended a large gold cross. Her head was crowned with a glittering tiara, bright with many a gem, while her hair, white with the frost of age though still abundant, fell in profusion around her person.</p> 
               <p>As she drew near she frowned darkly on us; and turning<pb n=""/> ing sharply to her brother demanded who we were, and if we knew who she was.</p> 
               <p>"I fear not, Annastene."</p> 
               <p>"Then instruct them in their duty."</p> 
               <p>When, bending down, he whispered impressively, "Kneel, my dear young friend, and kiss the lady's hand."</p> 
               <p>Instantaneously, without thought, I at once obeyed; indeed, I was in such a state of terror I hardly knew what I was about.</p> 
               <p>The action, however, pleased her, for laying her hand gently on my head she murmured some words, as though in blessing. And then her brother, before she had time to turn to Arthur and Florence, who stood gazing in mute astonishment, took her hand in the most deferential manner, begging to have a few words with her, and led her away, followed by the silent attendant. Passing under the drapery, they disappeared, and we heard a door close quickly behind them.</p> 
               <p>We looked at each other bewildered; the thing had passed so quickly it seemed like some shifting scene in a drama. "I am so frightened!" said Florence; "I wish we were at home."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Massarene soon returned. He looked dejected and sad. I felt a strange pity fill my heart for him.</p> 
               <p>"My poor sister!" were his first words, and turning to me he said, "Olive, will you forgive me for asking you to so humiliate yourself?"</p> 
               <p>"Humiliate myself!" I spoke low, with half-stifled utterance, still full of that great pity. "No, sir; no, Mr. Massarene, it is no humiliation to kneel for the blessing of such a venerable lady."</p> 
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5593-00000039"/> 
               <p>"Thank you! thank you!" he repeated, with touching tenderness; "you are right. A certain homage to some ideal is all she asks, and we might well afford to indulge the innocent fancies of one so afflicted as she."</p> 
               <p>I know not whether it was my ready obedience, or from some other unaccountable cause, I was always, after this, marked by her peculiar favor; and when the many infirmities of old age crept over her, and the tension of the irritated nerves was stilled, and she sat in her soft, rolling chair, helpless as a little child, then she loved to have me by her, holding my hand, smiling, and caressing me, as though I took the place of some one far back in the indistinct, misty memory of her faded life.</p> 
               <milestone n="" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>But a few years more, and childhood, with all its gay, light, keen, but evanescent emotions, was passing away, and the real play of life, whether for tragedy or comedy, was opening for us. Florence and I were now seventeen; and Arthur, three years older, had finished his studies, and was to travel until he had attained his majority, or, at least, within a short time of it.</p> 
               <p>This separation was our first great trial, at least we considered it one of the gravest importance; for a time we were inconsolable, the interest and zest seemed taken out of everything, and in the companionship of our mournings and sentimentalities we enjoyed all the luxury of our first days of woe.</p> 
               <p>But this could not last; the buoyancy of life and health was too strong within us; and soon returning hours brought with them their desires, and our many<pb n=""/> vows to devote thought, feeling, everything, to the contemplation of the dear absent one, began to vanish into thin air.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">YOUTHFUL PATRIOTISM.</head> 
               <p>ARTHUR was away. He had graduated creditably from Trinity College, Dublin, and was now traveling with his tutor, expecting to be absent until he attained his majority.</p> 
               <p>Every week there were letters from him,-long letters to his father and mother, descriptive of the places he visited and the people he met. With these generally came two dainty notes for Florence and myself,-his little sisters, as he styled us. These billets for our own special perusal were brimming with youthful vivacity, and were fresh and loving as their boyish author.</p> 
               <p>The reception of these epistles and inditing suitable answers to them occupied a large portion of our time, one perusal and discussion of their contents being altogether too brief a consideration of documents so important. Every little incident in our daily lives became vivid and interesting, because we were to describe it to Arthur. Daily visitors, daily discussions, the excitement of the times, which I, especially, felt without really comprehending, made up a large portion of our letters.</p> 
               <p>Sometimes the little notes which I received were so<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5593-00000040"/> ardent in expression, I shrank from showing them to Florence. Mere boyish words, perhaps, but I blushed as I read them: "He must fly to me!" "He could not live without me!" These were dangerous words; I felt them so, by the echoes they awakened in my own heart. I must battle against every inroad of sentiment such as this. Who was I, to dare indulge in or awaken such feelings as these? I might, however, love him as a brother-perhaps that was all he meant-a dear, good, loving brother. I wondered if he used such endearing, heart-stirring expressions to Florence, but I could not ask.</p> 
               <p>And then other letters came to me, more lengthy, full of inquiries about the country. He was hearing most unfavorable reports. Could I not get him some reliable information through Mr. Massarene or Walter? The English papers were filled with contradictory statements; they urged such severe measures that sometimes his fears, sometimes his indignation and patriotism, were roused. "A man must be a patriot," said Arthur, "and stand by his own people if he is a man at all. For my part, my blood boils as I read the slanders that are published against Ireland. The turbulent Irish, forsooth! 'Crush them,' cry the cold-blooded Englishmen; 'force is the only thing they understand.' Let them dare attempt it, we will see what Ireland's sons can do! But, Olive, gather all the facts for me, will you? Let me know, and quickly, how things are with the dear old land."</p> 
               <p>When in England, Arthur grew still more excited, as still wilder statements and stranger rumors reached him from day to day.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"It is a fashion here," he wrote, to throw everything Irish into contempt. I am constantly in open warfare with those about me: I vindicate my country; they condemn it. Then I am angry with myself for being so roused by those who only judge by their prejudices, and whom I should treat with silent scorn. I am astonished to find how little is known of our country and people, even among those most intelligent."</p> 
               <p>These letters I showed to Mr. Massarene, who read them calmly and thoughtfully.</p> 
               <p>"Is there not hope for our hardly-used country," I exclaimed, impatient for a response to my own enthusiasm, "when its young men hold such sentiments, and are ready to make such sacrifices? Oh, is he not generous-hearted and noble, Mr. Massarene?"</p> 
               <p>"Generous and noble he is, Olive, but-"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, do not say 'but'; let it be all right."</p> 
               <p>"But I must say I do not see the sacrifice, as yet. He is young, my girl, and has yet to be tried." Then seeing my crest-fallen countenance, he added, kindly, "But I hope he may prove all you anticipate."</p> 
               <p>I was disappointed. I thought Mr. Massarene, who had inspired us with patriotic fervor, and had always himself manifested so warm an attachment to his native land, would have been elated as myself at finding Arthur's attachments like his own. But then I whispered to myself, "Mr. Massarene is old; and that, they say, makes people cautious,-he does not wish to venture a decided opinion. I find it so in a great many other things."</p> 
               <p>I was walking through the lane that led from Mr.<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5593-00000041"/> Massarene's grounds to the back avenue of the Hall, as I pondered my disappointment, when, looking up, I saw Walter approaching. "Ah," I thought, "Walter will understand all this; I will tell him what Arthur says." With restored equanimity, I smiled and greeted my friend perhaps more cordially than usual. I delivered Arthur's message desiring some information from him, and read some passages in Arthur's last letter, which I deemed aglow with patriotism.</p> 
               <p>Walter listened as I read, but there was quite a pause before he answered; then he said abruptly, "If he is in England and so near us, I think he might come and hear for himself. Such as he are much needed now, I can tell you, Olive. If he feels all he says, let him come home, and that at once."</p> 
               <p>"But you know, Walter, he cannot come home without his father's consent; and that, I am sure, will not be given."</p> 
               <p>"I do not know any such thing," he answered, sharply. And then, looking me keenly in the face, he asked, with something of a sneer in his tone, "Why is it, Olive, that you are always defending and excusing Arthur?"</p> 
               <p>As he spoke and looked the blood rushed to my face, forehead, neck, even to the very tips of my fingers; and before I could, in my confusion, find words to reply, he had turned and walked away.</p> 
               <p>Angry and mortified, I stood still in the spot where he left me, vexed with Walter, doubly vexed with myself for this exhibition. I defend Arthur! What was there to defend? How everybody misunderstood me-how unfair Walter was!</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Thus I stood, so absorbed in thought that I did not notice, till he spoke, that Walter had returned.</p> 
               <p>"Olive," he said, gently.</p> 
               <p>I looked up, and seeing the sad expression of his face, my heart relented at once. Was he in trouble? What could I do for him? I wanted to ask him this, but I could not find courage to speak. I had lately become a little afraid of Walter, he was so fitful in his moods: sometimes tender and kind, sometimes harsh, almost discourteous, in his bearing towards me. I did fear him a little.</p> 
               <p>There was a message which he had forgotten to deliver, he said. It was from my father, who had been at the lodge that day, and would be there again in the evening. My father desired that I should meet him there.</p> 
               <p>I nodded assent and hastened on. Florence would be waiting for me to join her in her afternoon ride. But I could not get Walter from my thoughts. He seemed so changed, so different from the bright-faced boy who used, when we met, to open his arms wide for me to jump into. Well, I was a little girl no longer,-perhaps that was it. But he had been my only friend in those days, the only one to whom my shy nature could freely unburden itself. Now things were changed it appeared-sadly changed; a great, an unspeakable something had come between us. I could talk to Arthur, Florence, any one, more readily. It was not that I no longer respected Walter. I still acknowledged his superiority, though, perhaps, a more cultured taste and refined associations rendered his workman's garb and coarse hands unduly repugnant to me. Yet within<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5593-00000042"/> the rude exterior the MAN was always visible. If my fastidious tastes were sometimes shocked by his want of polish, the awkwardness of his movements, I knew that behind all this was a mind of rare force; and I could not but own that, with Arthur's advantages, Walter would have been far in advance of him. But Arthur was so much more companionable, one was so much more at ease with him, though he could occasionally play the tyrant, as I well remembered; but then he was so readily influenced-well-there I stopped the enumeration of my hero's fine qualities, for I felt myself getting on dangerous ground.</p> 
               <p>As I reached the Hall, I saw Florence standing in the portico waiting for me. Very lovely she looked, with the afternoon sun slanting on her bright hair and the drapery of her green riding-habit which swept the marble at her feet. If I could have conveyed to canvas the impression her whole appearance made upon me at that moment, rare would have been the tints, exquisitely delicate the penciling which embodied the radiant and spirituelle maiden who stood smiling and beckoning me. A strange feeling swept over me at the moment, a thought scarce breathed to myself, and vanishing instantly. Could it be that this rich flush of early opening would ever be otherwise than now? Would the fine petals unfolding, fragrant and glowing, fade slowly as hardier blossoms fade? Yet why indulge such ominous forebodings in presence of this overflowing life and vivacity? I shut away my silly shadows, born, no doubt, of the depression caused by my interview with Walter.</p> 
               <p>Florence had fulfilled every promise of her childhood,<pb n=""/> both in mind and person; frank, innocent, and pure, she loved me now with the same confiding friendship that she had in the first years of our intimate association.</p> 
               <p>I hurried up to my room, and was soon equipped; and, mounting our ponies, we cantered away, followed by the groom.</p> 
               <p>It was a fine autumn afternoon, and the trees were glowing with their October splendors, every copse and wood-crowned slope, of the great park shone jewel-like in the mellow sunshine. Florence was in high spirits, and my own soon caught the infection. For the sake of variety, it was proposed that we should take a new way to reach the "glen of Downs," our usual place for a gallop, and the fashionable resort of the gay neighborhood. We would go through a by-way or cut in the woods bordering this beautiful road. Through the narrow by-way, however, we found it only possible to pass one at a time, and Florence led the way, riding at full speed, and being under such headway, as we merged into the open road, that she almost came in collision with two gentlemen, who were quietly walking their horses under the shade of the trees.</p> 
               <p>Of course there was a full stop; the gentlemen reining in their startled animals in time to prevent any mishap, as the unexpected vision bore down upon them. Florence was all confusion and blushes; she apologized with the utmost earnestness.</p> 
               <p>"Not a word, not a word, my dear young lady," said the elder of the two gentlemen, gallantly. "A spirited steed and a spirited rider need no apology. I<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5593-00000043"/> feel myself the gainer by the encounter. I only fear," he added, glancing at his young companion, who sat speechless, the reins falling loosely from his hands, as he gazed at the fair apparition, "I only fear that my young friend has been struck."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I hope not," Florence replied, with perfect navet. Then seeing him smile, she colored still more deeply; and, the groom coming up, we bowed to our two knights and rode away.</p> 
               <p>"What a hoyden they must have thought me!" said Florence, with something of chagrin in her voice. "What would mamma say if she heard of it? Oh, dear! my 'usual heedlessness,' I suppose, would be her comment. Olive, it <emph>does</emph> seem as if I never should get to be a reliable and decorous personage."</p> 
               <p>Lady Grace was very strict in all conventional matters, and the prospect of her displeasure was no light matter; still we could not help laughing at the mishap, and more merrily still at the piteous picture of herself Florence presented in the garb of "a decorous personage." We cantered on gayly towards the seashore, chattering as we went, when suddenly the sound of a fife broke in upon our "high discourse."</p> 
               <p>"That is Tim," said Florence, listening. "Yes, I am sure that is his fife. I should like to see him; wouldn't you, Olive?"</p> 
               <p>We had not met either old Doughty or Tim for a long, long, time; and, drawn by the sound of the music, we set out to get a sight of them.</p> 
               <p>Passing through a rough, overgrown path, leading from the main road to the outskirts of the wood, we came upon a sort of mud hovel raised among a clump<pb n=""/> of trees; and there, sure enough, at its door, sat Tim enthroned on a rough box, and blowing away with such earnestness that he did not see or hear us until we were close upon him, when he jumped from his seat and gazed upon us in utter astonishment.</p> 
               <p>The boy was little altered since we saw him last, though it was some years ago. His head was, perhaps, huger than ever, covered with its immense brush of hair, but nature seemed to have stopped with that effort; his twisted and misshapen limbs were not improved by time or growth. Tim's face had lost, in a measure, its droll and quizzical expression; evidently the world had used him hardly.</p> 
               <p>"You do not remember us?" we said, in answer to his bewildered gaze.</p> 
               <p>"Be jabers," he said, with his old knowing look, "how should I remember such grand young ladies?"</p> 
               <p>We reminded him of that day by the roadside when we were all so frightened at his encounter with Arthur.</p> 
               <p>His face lighted up.</p> 
               <p>"Thrue for yees!" he cried; and taking off his old cap, swept the ground with it in the profoundness of his salutation. "Ay, thrue for yees! I might well remember it." And he screwed up his crooked shoulders significantly, as if still suffering the effects of that memorable battle.</p> 
               <p>"But, troth and upon me conscience," he added, rubbing his head and scanning us critically, "who would have thought yees would ever have been such splendid young ladies? and, asking yer favor, miss," looking at me, "espicially yerself. Whew! by gorry, it takes me breath away to look at yees."</p> 
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5593-00000044"/> 
               <p>"And where is the young master?" continued Tim, before we could reply to this overwhelming compliment. "He'd hardly like to have a bout with the likes of me by this time."</p> 
               <p>"I suppose not, and be worsted," said Florence, laughing. "But where is old Doughty-he is not dead?" she added, in a subdued voice.</p> 
               <p>"Lord, no, miss; there he is." And he pointed to what I had supposed was a heap of rags in the corner.</p> 
               <p>Poor old creature! there he lay, a repulsive sight, with his tattered gown over him and one of his many bundles under his head. Stretched at full length on a low platform slightly raised from the ground, the miserable beggar seemed to us to have arrived at the last low ebb of humanity.</p> 
               <p>"How uncomfortable he must be, poor old man!" we both exclaimed, compassionately.</p> 
               <p>"Not he, ladies; he is as happy as a king."</p> 
               <p>"And what does he have to eat?"</p> 
               <p>"Sorra a bit these ten days, only the dhrop of whisky that puts heart into him."</p> 
               <p>As if to corroborate the statement, the old man raised his head, looking around with glittering eyes.</p> 
               <p>"Tim, where's the bottle?" he said; then dropped back with a groan. Tim quickly administered the dose, and the invalid lay tranquil again. But there was a ghastly look on his shriveled face, and a bright spot burned on either cheek. The eyes were alert and shining yet, but the lips were pale, as with the touch of death. Indeed, this was no pleasant sight to come upon out of the radiant sunshine and the glad outer air. I could not help shrinking back a little as Florence,<pb n=""/> full of interest and commiseration, hung over the tattered wretch, who seemed taking his farewell of a forlorn existence to the sound of Tim's fife; departing as he had entered the world, not knowing or caring whither.</p> 
               <p>He lay still a moment and again called Tim, and fumbled with his skinny hands among his rags. The sense of property was always strong in old Doughty, and he was minded to pass away properly, surrounded by what had accompanied him in many a roadside tramp,-his bundles, his scraps of cast-off clothing and of broken meats, his tatters, great and small, and all else that should be his.</p> 
               <p>"Tim," said he, piteously, as he groped about, "Come, Tim, give me the ha'pence. Give me the ha'pence."</p> 
               <p>"Whist, ye old blatherskite!" shouted the impatient nurse. "Whist! the quality's here."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Tim!" said Florence, shocked beyond measure, "don't speak to the poor old man in that way."</p> 
               <p>"Lord, miss, he don't know! Say me love an' me dear, it 'ud be all the same."</p> 
               <p>"Then, why do you talk so?" she said.</p> 
               <p>"Because-well, by gorry, I must-if I didn't I'd beat him!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Tim!"</p> 
               <p>"Sure me heart's broke wid him, and I get mad an' savage. It's nothing but liftin' an' layin', running with the dhrop of whisky, or screeching on the fife night an' day. I've no rest,-I'm kilt entirely."</p> 
               <p>"And does he love music so well?" still continued Florence.</p> 
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5593-00000045"/> 
               <p>"Sorra a bit he cares for it, miss, but it keeps him quiet,-he thinks the pennies are coming in. I've whistled and blowed for him this long year, but divil a penny he'll give. Do ye hear them clinking under his bed?"</p> 
               <p>"Tim, Tim, ye'll move me now!" groaned the old man.</p> 
               <p>As Tim performed that office, he jerked the bag under the old man's head (willfully I am afraid); the action brought a volley of oaths and exclamations, as old Doughty spasmodically clutched his treasure.</p> 
               <p>"Ye limb of the divil, ye'll never have it!" he gasped, falling back as he said it, like one in the last agony. "Tim, darlint," he whimpered, in a moment after, "give me the whisky."</p> 
               <p>After the whisky, Tim was called upon to give him another turn.</p> 
               <p>"So it goes," said Tim, philosophically.</p> 
               <p>Pained and almost sick with the scene, we turned to go.</p> 
               <p>But it will not be long you'll be troubled, Tim," I said, softly, as we were about to leave.</p> 
               <p>"Why, how, miss?"</p> 
               <p>"Because he will soon be gone."</p> 
               <p>"Where,-to the poorhouse, miss? Now, divil a fut will he go there while Tim's alive."</p> 
               <p>"No, not to the poorhouse," I said, vehemently; "he's going to die! I see it in his face,-he'll not live a day longer."</p> 
               <p>"Die is it? Die? Oh, cushla, me old man,-me father and me mother! Oh, no; he <emph>can't</emph> die; he mustn't die; I'll not have it!" And he set up such a<pb n=""/> yell that even the deadened ears of the old man tingled with it.</p> 
               <p>"Tim, Tim, who's harmin' ye?" he cried. "Off man, I say, an' let him alone; he's but a puir body. Bring me the pennies, Tim; no, here they are, I've got 'em fast, never fear."</p> 
               <p>Glad to escape, we left the hut, telling Tim, whom we left moaning and sobbing, that we would send help to him very soon. How sweet the outer air felt after that stifling atmosphere, that scene of human degradation! Mounting our ponies, we soon reached the road; and had gone but a few yards, when we saw one of those monkish figures, which are no strangers to the eyes of travelers in Ireland, approaching. A singular figure, with eyes cast down upon the ground, and wrapped in a long, gray woolen robe girt at the waist with a stout string. His head was bare, the hair closely shaven, with no protection from the weather but a cowl or hood attached to the dress. Coarse sandals were bound on his bare feet, his hard and weather-beaten features were by no means prepossessing; a low forehead, heavy features, and eyes of dull blue were its distinguishing characteristics.</p> 
               <p>Florence, with her quick impulsiveness, instantly bethought herself that here was the proper person to attend old Doughty.</p> 
               <p>"Good father," she said, riding up to him, "there is one dying near by. Would you in mercy visit him?"</p> 
               <p>The friar, still with eyes bent on the ground, answered, "Lady, my vows forbid my holding converse with one of your sex." He spoke with a foreign accent.</p> 
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5593-00000046"/> 
               <p>But Florence, always ready and resolved in her purpose, turned quickly to our groom.</p> 
               <p>"Riley," said she, "you will explain to this father, and lead him to old Doughty. We will proceed on our way home alone."</p> 
               <p>"Well!" exclaimed Florence, as we rode away; "a self-made martyr to be sure! I have no patience with such. Mortifying themselves indeed-it is self-exaltation instead. They think they are doing great things. In my opinion it is very poor work indeed. Not speak with one of our sex, Olive, think of that! A little of their advice might do him good, I fancy."</p> 
               <p>She had almost worked herself into a passion over the poor priest, when we came in sight of the Hall. Anxious to get help for Tim, we rode into the back entrance, and hastened up to the drawing-room to see Sir Robert and Lady Grace before taking off our riding-habits. To our consternation we found ourselves in the presence of the two gentlemen whom we had encountered on the road.</p> 
               <p>Our confusion was unnoticed by Sir Robert, who, taking his daughter by the hand, presented her to his guests. The elder was Lord Castlereagh; the younger, Major Trenchard. I also was kindly introduced as his ward.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <head>CHAPTER X.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES-LORD CASTLEREAGH.</head> 
               <p>LORD CASTLEREAGH! The name with which Ireland rang at that time; the name which was at once the centre of hope and the centre of discord. The mention of that lofty title acted as a spell upon me; and for a time I was utterly silenced. To meet our heroes of the road quietly domesticated on our own hearthstone was astonishment enough; but to find ourselves face to face with so great a man, stumbled upon accidentally, like any other mortal, was like a return to the old days when the gods walked in disguise.</p> 
               <p>Some laughing explanations took place as to our having met before, and some faint attempts at censure were made by Sir Robert and Lady Grace; with playful threatenings of greater vigilance, if this was our manner of proceeding when out of sight,-running down peaceful travelers on the highway, and putting quiet horsemen in peril of their lives.</p> 
               <p>Florence, with her ingenuous apologies, her innocent blushes, and, above all, by her recital of our interview with the dying beggar, made a conquest at once, both of her parents and of their guests, especially of the younger gentleman, whose admiration was plainly written in his face.</p> 
               <p>For myself, my attention was absorbed in Lord Castlereagh. Much as I had heard about him, I found that<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5593-00000047"/> he differed essentially from the portrait my imagination had drawn. We always personify those whom we hear much about, and I had supposed his lordship an aged man; grave, stern, and inflexible; borne down by the weight of his responsibilities. But here was almost a young man, a man full of vigor, ability, and, apparently, reserved force. Grave and dignified he certainly was, but a man of the world, nevertheless; not withdrawn by loftier affairs from appreciation of the social amenities of life; he was elegantly attired, with even scrupulous attention to the fashion of the day. It seemed to me that his mind, remote and far (as I regarded it) above the trifles that filled our lives, sought ease and rest by occasional mingling with his fellow men on their own ground.</p> 
               <p>Yet, after all, the topics of conversation at the time of which I write were such as might have interested the profoundest statesman. Politics were the fashion; political discussion was familiar to all classes, from the peasant to the peer. In the lowest hovels and pot-houses, as in the fashionable club of the capital or the drawing-room of the aristocrat, the condition of affairs, the prospects of the country, were the absorbing theme.</p> 
               <p>Even among the ladies discussion and argument on these topics were quite general. I had listened to many a drawing-room chat between lofty legislators and fair and fashionable women. But gentlemen seldom do more than play at argument with the gentler sex. They cannot snub the fair creatures, to be sure; but they are non-committal, play off all the artillery of male coquetry. An expressive shrug, an appreciative smile, a condescending "Oh," and "Ah!" and "I quite<pb n=""/> agree with you, my dear madame!" these serve to ward off the attacks of the amiable politicians in petticoats, who are best no doubt kept in the background,-who may see too far, know too much, and who can't hold their tongues about state affairs and governmental secrets, you know, any more than about other things. It is best to fight shy of them.</p> 
               <p>But, as I have said, politics were now the fashion. In the small dinner-parties, lately so frequent at the Hall, nothing else was heard; and among the names most often mentioned as leader in the Irish Parliament had been that of Lord Castlereagh.</p> 
               <p>He seemed to be the especial hope of his party; regarded by them as a close reasoner, a skillful statesman, a friend of the government, who wished to benefit the people of Ireland through legitimate channels, and would put down imperatively any attempt at resistance to established authority. In the after-dinner gathering of the ladies, I heard his virtues discussed, his faithfulness to his friends descanted upon, his social and domestic gifts. My humble judgment had not dissented from the general voice which proclaimed this man a hero, and I stood in his presence somewhat awed and silent.</p> 
               <p>Seeing me thus withdrawn, as it were, from the animated group about me, Lord Castlereagh kindly drew me into conversation, asking me some local questions in regard to the country, and expressing himself pleased with my answers. I felt indebted to his courtesy, and charmed by his affability; yet, at this very moment, by some strange transition, my mind recalled some sinister things which, amid the general acclamation<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5593-00000048"/> tion, had been whispered in regard to his official career. I remembered a conversation held with Mr. Massarene, in which, after I had been expatiating with great warmth on what I had heard of this celebrated man, my old friend said quietly, with his peculiar smile, "Keep cool, my little girl,-wait a little. Do not judge too hastily. Your little inexperienced head cannot take the measure as yet of this polished diplomatist. You cannot penetrate his complicated motives. Never was Ireland," he added, "in greater need of a master-mind; one that, above the small ambitions of party and the influence of cliques, could legislate for its universal interests; but Lord Castlereagh is not that pre-eminent mind. He sees quickly but not profoundly; self-concentrated, unsympathetic, without comprehensive genius, he knows but little of those whom he would rule. He is essentially a party leader."</p> 
               <p>I remembered this, and much more of like import, as I stood for a few moments talking with this courteous and elegant guest. I tried to read in his face what manner of man he might be; the suave smile, the subtle glance of the keen, gray eye eluded my research. I left the problem for the future to decide.</p> 
               <p>After this we saw his lordship and Major Trenchard frequently at the Hall. Indeed, at this time, our house was thronged with visitors from far and near.</p> 
               <p>The Greytons, of Greyton Hall, were among the oldest and most influential Protestant families in the southwest of Ireland; and it was necessary, in these times of wide-spread disaffection, to conciliate, in every way, all those who might add to the strength of the British government. Statesmen, councillors, judges,<pb n=""/> now formed our society. His excellency the lord lieutenant and his lady, in their carriage and four with outriders, were often seen on their way to Greyton Hall. Post-coaches, with distinguished strangers direct from ministers in Europe, dashed along the quiet road to our home. They came to consult confidentially with Sir Robert; apparently they could not do him honor enough. Lady Grace was in her element, this atmosphere of almost official importance and influence suited her well. I had never seen her so lifted from her formal uniformity of bearing as at this time.</p> 
               <p>Perhaps the capital and the entire country never presented such a scene of gayety as during this fall and winter of 1797. Regiment after regiment marched into the various garrisons. Generals, colonels, and captains were bringing their families to spend the winter at the centre of life and attraction, the busy capital. Noblemen, long absent with their families, were returning to their neglected estates to look after their interests. Startling reports of the unsettled state of the country had doubtless reached their ears abroad; but here-here they saw nothing to give rise to disquiet. The only agitation was that of pleasurable excitement, surely. Entertainments of all kinds were in progress; military reviews and parades were the order of the day. A gay and busy season, truly; under whose animated current only the knowing ones discerned, perhaps, the signs of the times.</p> 
               <p>Young ladies and gentlemen fresh from the London metropolis, who had bemoaned their fate and the cruelty of papas and mammas who brought them to horrid Ireland, found themselves agreeably surprised.<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5593-00000049"/> Why, Dublin and Dublin society was absolutely delightful! Such drives! such balls! such polite people!</p> 
               <p>So the butterflies flitted secure in the sunshine of the present, caring nothing what came with to-morrow.</p> 
               <p>Lady Grace, as I have said, was unusually animated. Her sympathies were, of course, with her kindred and the land of her birth. She was an Englishwoman, and had many relatives in England. To be sure she had lived many, and, perhaps, her happiest years in Ireland, as she often remarked still, had she to choose between the two, her heart was with those among whom her childhood had been spent. She was thoroughly English in sentiment. Not so Sir Robert. I could discern, at this time, through all the gloss of his cordial hospitality, his hearty welcome of strangers, his cheerful bearing to his guests-I could, I thought, plainly discern-a deep-seated uneasiness. At times this amounted to actual unhappiness; once, especially, after bowing out with courteous smiles some emissaries with whom he had been closeted, I saw him return and, throwing himself in his chair, absolutely weep. His heart was with his country; but he had not the power to battle with circumstances, and stand forth in its defense. Weak, irresolute,-anxious to do right, yet timid in its execution,-this man was truly to be pitied. His ancestors, in the many outbreaks that had in past times distracted this unfortunate country, were always on the side of the government, and he supposed he must do as they had done. Then his family interests, his duty to his son, now arriving at majority, were all on the side of conservatism. Altogether, he was very unhappy. Many years of intercourse with the frank<pb n=""/> and friendly Sir Robert enabled me to read his mind without a word being spoken. And, perhaps, an inkling of the state of things had reached beyond his own demesne, and caused this constant and unusual attention from distinguished parties without. They knew their man: he must be conciliated, he must be reasoned with. Once committed to their policy, his sense of honor would bind him to his party; until then there might be danger.</p> 
               <p>Major Trenchard, as may be conjectured, became our constant guest. His regiment was garrisoned just below Arklow; and when off duty, which must have been frequent, he was always at the Hall. I saw that Florence was becoming as deeply interested in him as he was in her. The frank openness peculiar to her character rendered it impossible for her to conceal even these most delicate emotions. I was, however, her only confidante. To me she poured out her feelings. How wonderful, how brave, how handsome he was! I think she almost marveled there was not some public recognition of his claims to universal homage. Then, again, she was troubled with doubts. <emph>Could</emph> he love her-this military archangel?</p> 
               <p>At which uncalled-for humility, I laughed outright. <emph>I</emph> was not in love with Major Trenchard. In fact, when I first became acquainted with him, a feeling something like repulsion affected me towards the epauletted stranger; and it was with a feeling of pain that I noted the growing interest with which Florence regarded him. This feeling gradually wore away, however, when I saw his real devotion, his anxious tenderness for my friend.</p> 
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5593-00000050"/> 
               <p>Never was Florence more perfectly lovely than at this time. This great and growing passion gave to her almost childlike beauty the added charm of thought. She was living now for another.</p> 
               <p>Yet, with all her bloom and beauty, she was but a fragile flower. A slight fatigue exhausted her; a sharp, cool breeze would often give her a troublesome cough. The careful watchfulness of her lover, his exceeding attention to her health and happiness, worked a miracle in his favor. I dropped my dislike, and became a warm advocate of this major.</p> 
               <p>In our afternoon rides Florence had proudly taken him to visit the celebrated places in our neighborhood. In these rides I was fain to confess that the enthusiasm of our gallant escort was all that could be desired. He was in raptures with the wild glens, the lovely lakes, the mountain passes, the glories of the sea-side.</p> 
               <p>"But I want you to see the inside of some of our Irish cottages," Florence would say after one of these outbursts. "I know how you English people talk about them: papa has told me all that. Because some of them are too bad to mention, you will have it that all are so. I want you to see for yourself. I have one little gem in my mind,-the nicest, tidiest little place; I mean Dolly Jamieson's. Olive, <emph>isn't</emph> it nice?"</p> 
               <p>I assented; adding, with a smile, "But the major will hardly consider this a fair specimen, will he, Florence?"</p> 
               <p>"There are plenty more quite as comfortable," said Florence, quickly, "but I mean to begin with this."</p> 
               <p>The major assured her, solemnly, that he was waiting<pb n=""/> and anxious to be enlightened; that, as the subject of Irish tenantry was one on which he had no fixed opinion, she might mould him with her plastic hand. "Only," he added, "let the process be a merciful one. Begin with the best, by all means."</p> 
               <p>The cottages on the Greyton estate were in much better condition than many others, thanks to the constant care and vigilance of Lady Grace. She had her schools, her institutions for the destitute, her visiting days for oversight and instruction, her hours for care of and reading with the sick. Everything was thought of and looked after. In fact, the great trouble was that too much was done.</p> 
               <p>Her plans were all admirably arranged: so much so, that the worthy rector, her adviser and particular friend, had taken occasion to speak of them publicly in a most approving manner, and, with his bustling and cheerful wife, had held them up in private as a shining example of what other noble ladies might effect. Yet somehow, with all this commendation, but few things worked exactly right. There was a fearful wear and tear of conscience among her beneficiaries. They must listen to the good lady who had done, and might still do, so much for them. Sure an' it must be the truth that comes from such blessed lips,-Heaven be her bed!</p> 
               <p>Ingratitude is not the sin of the Irish peasant, but questions which have puzzled wiser brains were not likely to be unraveled by their simple processes of thought. Between the doctrines and benefits of her Protestant ladyship, and the commands of the priest, there must be some middle course. There must be truth<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5593-00000051"/> in the good books she sent them; troth! they believed every word she said. But if Father Brenan should hear of it! Wasn't it only the other day he tould us from the holy altar, on the peril of our sowls, not to listen to "delusive doctrines from whited sepulchres?" "Them was his very words," said good Mrs. Brady, one of Lady Grace's most exacting and able-bodied "poor."</p> 
               <p>"Whited sepulchres?" repeated the bewildered woman. "Surely he couldn't mean our good lady. Lord forbid! But sometimes, they do say, the devil comes in the grandest ways. Ochone! what'll I do?"</p> 
               <p>And then the gaping youngsters would be threatened with vengeance dire-they would be kilt entirely-if they ever dared to mention what they had heard, or to name her ladyship before his reverence.</p> 
               <p>My lady was reputed a zealous proselytizer; and so, in some quarters, there was a jealous watchfulness of her doings, and whispered threats and innuendoes were not wanting to urge that conscientious religionist to an unbending discharge of her duty.</p> 
               <p>She would have been surprised, doubtless, if some good angel had whispered her that, after all, most of the good that was done her tenantry reached them through her daughter Florence,-Florence, who made no effort, Florence, who made no sacrifice,-whose simple, impulsive nature was adapted to win love and kindness everywhere. When she appeared there were no fears nor concealments, no anxious efforts to please. It was natural to love her, and the good people did this with all their hearts.</p> 
               <p>Dolly Jamieson was one of our pets; and so, with<pb n=""/> great confidence, we set out at the appointed time, armed with a message from Lady Grace, who had heard, she said, that the good woman was in some trouble.</p> 
               <p>No trouble, however, appeared on the smiling countenance which greeted us as we dismounted at the cottage. Buxom and full of good-humor, Dolly ushered us within with bustling hospitality; scattering, with a vigorous sweep of her apron, some stray chickens in the doorway, and administering a sharp rebuke to a group of little ones who stood staring at the visitors with mouths agape.</p> 
               <p>At length we were fairly seated, Dolly herself remaining standing,-a comely figure in her short blue petticoat, tightly-fitting curricle, and check apron, the corner of which was flung over her stout, rosy arm.</p> 
               <p>"Mamma has heard you were in trouble, Dolly," said Florence, when the excitement of our entrance had subsided. "She hopes it is nothing serious."</p> 
               <p>"Thrue for you, miss, I am in throuble," answered comfortable-looking Dolly, lifting her apron to her eyes, "in sore throuble; but it isn't for the likes of me to spake of such things before your ladyships."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, do, Dolly! tell us what is the matter," we both exclaimed. "Is Matthew sick? or has he lost his work? or what else is it?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no! not that, my ladies; it's a heart trouble, and the Lord knows what may come of it. But ye'll laugh at me, young ladies" (which we earnestly assured her we would not); "ye scholar-bred folk don't think of these things as we do. But its rale sorrow. I never knew but ruin to come of it."</p> 
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5593-00000052"/> 
               <p>"How sorry I am!" said Florence, with her ever-ready sympathy.</p> 
               <p>"Thank ye, miss; and I'll begin an' take it up from the first. Well, last Sunday evening, after the childher was in bed and asleep, I says to Matthew (who is always quiet and at home-not, like some of our neighbors, off to the pot-house on the holy days), I says to Matthew, 'let's take a walk.' An' sure we did, an' wandered on till we came to the beach and clear down, by the ruins of the ould castle-ye remimber it, miss-that used to belong to the O'Toole family; and a grand place it was then, fit for a king, as I've heard my grannie tell. Well, miss, it was a fine, clear night, not a cloud anywhere, and yet the wind blew, and the waves came rolling in along the beach and dashed among the old foundations with a sound like thunder. I says to Matthew, 'No good can come to us if we stay here; some fearful thing is at work!' says I. 'Let us go home.' With that, Lord preserve us! above all the din there came clear to my ears, from among the ould walls and towers, the awful cry of the banshee! 'Matthew,' says I, 'there's the ould O'Toole banshee. There's trouble coming!' My heart was in me mouth with fear, an' I got home all of a thremble."</p> 
               <p>"Maybe it was a screech-owl?" suggested Florence, innocently.</p> 
               <p>"Lord bless ye, miss! haven't I heard it before? an' it always brings the throuble. An' sure enough it came the very next morning, miss, for in comes my young brother Dennis, an' says he was going to be married the morrow, miss, which is this very day-"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, dear!" we both exclaimed, too much relieved<pb n=""/> to wait the remainder of the story, "is that all? That isn't so bad, is it?"</p> 
               <p>At which I saw that Major Trenchard had much ado to keep from laughing; but Dolly proceeded more vehemently than ever. She was evidently warming with her subject.</p> 
               <p>"Not so bad is it, miss? Why, won't he be the third in the family that has married within the two weeks? My two sisters on Saturday, and now himself, the spalpeen! an' it niver fails to bring the bad luck."</p> 
               <p>"But won't he wait?" said Florence, deeply interested at this aspect of affairs.</p> 
               <p>"No, miss. I've begged it on my knees, but he declares to God he'll marry the day or niver."</p> 
               <p>Just then the figure of a strapping young fellow darkened the low doorway, and, with a spring, Dolly bounded toward him, taking his arm in her strong grip, and turning him in a twinkling into the middle of the room and right in front of us. He was evidently dressed in his best apparel. The gray frieze coat sat well on his broad shoulders, a gay, loosely-tied necktie adorned his throat, and from the buttonhole of his bright red vest was suspended the wedding-favor. Corduroy small-clothes, white-ribbed stockings, and high, well-polished brogans, well became the youthful figure of this rustic beau, whose holiday attire was completed by a high, narrow-crowned hat, set jauntily on one side his close, curly head. A manly fellow he looked, of whom no bride need be ashamed.</p> 
               <p>At first the youth was much abashed at being so suddenly presented, but the earnestness of his feelings<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5593-00000053"/> overcame his awkwardness. At this supreme moment of his life he was the equal of any one.</p> 
               <p>His sister tenaciously held his arm,-this was her last opportunity. She plead with him vehemently.</p> 
               <p>"An' sure, dear, ye'll think of your poor sisters and their families, and not do it the day?"</p> 
               <p>"Not do it the day!" he answered, violently, striving to get his arm away from her grasp. "Indade an' I'll be damned if I won't!"</p> 
               <p>"Ochone! ochone!" she cried, piteously; "is there no mercy in yer sowl?"</p> 
               <p>She still clung to his arm as though to prevent his leaving the house. The affair was so sudden we had not thought to interfere, sitting astounded spectators of the exciting and somewhat ludicrous scene.</p> 
               <p>Dolly now changed her tactics; she appealed to his feelings.</p> 
               <p>"Will ye not listen for the sake of the mother that bore ye,-that died for ye,-will ye have her curses instead of her prayers, ye unnatural baste? An' but for meself, where would ye have been the day? Did I not take ye as a baby, and do for ye? and ye'd bring us all to ruin! Ochone! ochone!" And again came another burst of despair.</p> 
               <p>The youth was evidently wavering; he began to look quite pale.</p> 
               <p>"But what will Mary say?" he cried, making one more effort to release himself. "Let me go! let me go, I say! Isn't Mary waiting?"</p> 
               <p>"An' would ye bring sorrow on us all for her waiting,-on yer own flesh and blood? Divil a foot ye'll stir."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>We now began to entreat for him. It was quite painful to see his agitation,-painful at least to us; on his sister neither that nor our entreaties had any effect. She only became more wildly obdurate. She went upon her knees and cursed him at one moment, the next fondled and coaxed and prayed, until the poor fellow, utterly prostrated, was obliged to submit.</p> 
               <p>"An' ye'll swear by yer dead not to do it?" cried Dolly.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes; anything!" was the answer; as, with a wild cry, he tore himself from her and rushed from the house.</p> 
               <p>We were all much shocked, this finale was so violent. But Mrs. Jamieson immediately recovered her equanimity.</p> 
               <p>"Don't you think he may go now and be married after all?" said Florence, breathlessly, having entered into the scene with intense interest.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, he daren't!" answered Dolly, triumphantly. "He knows there would be a blight on his sowl. He has taken <emph>the vow</emph>, and must abide by it."</p> 
               <p>Shortly after this we took our departure. Florence and I were a little flurried, but Major Trenchard could scarcely wait till we were beyond hearing of the victorious Dolly ere he burst into a fit of laughter, repeated at intervals as he looked at the discomposed face of Florence.</p> 
               <p>"Well, if that wasn't the richest treat," he said. "Why, she's a regular Nell Gwynne."</p> 
               <p>"Poor woman, but didn't she feel bad?"</p> 
               <p>"Bad!" he echoed; "did she look like it when the<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5593-00000054"/> contest was over? Poor fellow, <emph>he'll</emph> suffer, but she had a most enjoyable time."</p> 
               <milestone n="" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>Two important events marked the coming week. Major Trenchard proposed, and was accepted; not that there was exactly a formal engagement, Sir Robert and Lady Grace objecting to this, as Florence was so young and had not yet been out in the world. But the suitor had their full approbation, and as for my young friend, she knew she would always love him.</p> 
               <p>Sir Robert would doubtless have preferred that his daughter should have made choice of one of her own countrymen, but her ladyship was well pleased. The major stood high in his profession; his family were among the noblest; there was only one life between him and an earldom. A coronet would well grace the brow of her lovely daughter.</p> 
               <p>The other event was the announcement of Arthur's immediate return, and also that he would be accompanied by my old adversary,-Adele. Her brother had been ordered to Ireland with his regiment, and her mother had wished Adele to take the opportunity of visiting her dear friends in Ireland. She had hastened her preparations in order to accompany Arthur, as the regiment might not leave London for a couple of weeks.</p> 
               <p>With Arthur's letter of announcement came as usual a private note to myself and one to Florence. Hers I did not see, and mine I did not dare to show her, so full was it of tender protestations of regard. Oh, I wished he would not speak thus! And yet the words awoke a strange echo in my own heart. I would not<pb n=""/> acknowledge to myself the feeling they aroused; I was ashamed of it as of something to which I had no right; as though I were meanly stealing something which I should not dare to touch openly.</p> 
               <p>Arthur spoke very kindly of Adele. She was much changed and improved; in fact, quite another sort of personage. She had endeared herself to him by her frank admission and deep repentance of her girlish haughtiness and folly. "She hopes you will forgive her that little past squabble, Olive. I know you have forgotten it. I told her so, and told her all about you. She loves you like a sister."</p> 
               <p>But I had not forgotten it, and I doubted the sincerity of Adele's protestations. However, ashamed of the keenness of my recollections, and that my sensitiveness still retained the sting of what had transpired so many years ago, I resolved to regard the coming visitor in an amiable light, and follow her bright example of forgiveness and forgetfulness. If she had made me suffer, and wounded my childish pride to the quick, probably I had been obstinate and easily offended. At any rate, she was the near relation of my benefactress, and as such must be welcomed.</p> 
               <p>Great were the preparations made throughout the mansion; a beautiful boudoir was fitted up for Adele, and Arthur's favorite apartments were rearranged and beautified.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A LOWLY REVOLUTIONIST.</head> 
               <p>THE reader will recollect that I had received a message from my father on the day of our encounter with Lord Castlereagh and his friend. So busy have I been detailing events which grew out of that adventure, that it will be necessary to retrace my steps somewhat to take up the thread of narrative from that point.</p> 
               <p>My father's visit at the lodge was an unusual thing. Only once a year, on my birthday, did he make his appearance there. Poor father! in his struggle for subsistence he had little time for sentiment,-he knew that I was well cared for, and it sufficed. Yet I retained a strong attachment for him. Differing in appearance and manner from those with whom I was associated, there was yet a great power about him which inspired respect. He was grave, somewhat silent, having little of that hopeful buoyancy so natural to his class, which enables them to bound up from even the most depressing circumstances. He was not morose nor sour, but rather thoughtful, as one who ponders unfulfilled desires, and waits the issue of events. Of course he was uneducated,-at least so far as book-education went,-but he was a close observer, and had made himself something of an English scholar. I had heard from Walter that he was quite unhappy-troubled with the aspect of the times. I knew that Mr. Massarene highly<pb n=""/> respected him, and that there was a confidence between them in regard to political opinions, but that was all I knew. My grandmother was not in sympathy with anything that disturbed the present state of things,-indeed, she could not understand what better could be desired.</p> 
               <p>The conversation during the evening was general, inquiries for old remembered friends and neighbors, and the like, but I felt that this was not the purpose of my father's visit. When he arose to leave, he said, quietly, "It is a pleasant evening, Olive; put on your bonnet and walk a little way with me. Walter will return with you."</p> 
               <p>I was soon made acquainted with his reasons for wishing to see me. He was about starting for France.</p> 
               <p>"France!" I repeated in astonishment.</p> 
               <p>"Yes; and upon a mission of some importance, and it may be danger. You are no doubt surprised that they should send a man so obscure on an important errand connected with state affairs. But there are valuable papers to be conveyed to persons in France; any distinguished person might be suspected, and discovery would implicate a great many persons here. So they chose one in my unknown position, as being unlikely to be missed. A common countryman, you know, Olive," he said, with a quiet smile, "would not attract any attention. There are men enough, higher and better than I am, who are ready to go and take all the risks, but they would become objects of distrust to the government, and perfect secrecy is absolutely requisite. I am sure I can trust you, Olive; you have something of my nature in you,-safe and silent as a rock. Walter knows all about it, too,-but I wanted to see<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5593-00000056"/> you, my girl, before I went so far away. And if anything should happen when the water is between us, you will look a little after my good woman and the little boy, though they be not exactly your own kith and kin."</p> 
               <p>I promised everything he desired.</p> 
               <p>"But remember," said my thoughtful father, "I do not want you to go near them, only in case of need. Where you are it will not answer to have anything to do with the like o' them. It is only if I do not come back. The two of them are sickly like-and I doubt they will bear the trouble easily if it comes."</p> 
               <p>"But why go at all?" said I, in a sudden burst of grief. "There are young men without families, let them go. And your farm and your cattle, what is to become of them? and how will your family get food when you are away?"</p> 
               <p>For France seemed to me a great and far-off country that would take a long, long time to reach and to return from.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Olive, you talk as if this were a life-work. I expect, with fair wind, to go there and be back in a month. But perhaps I ought to tell you all,-I have no cattle and no farm, Olive. I am a desperate man. But do not start, child; I am no worse off than hundreds of others. Poverty and sore want are driving us on. It is this that stirs the devil in us."</p> 
               <p>"Do not talk in that way, father," I exclaimed, excitedly; "you will break my heart if you do."</p> 
               <p>"Well, well, my girl, I have no right to do that. I would not have told you anything, only I think you have now arrived at an age when you ought to know things as they are. The times are bad, terribly bad,<pb n=""/> my child; and among those you are with you will hear much against our class, the 'miserable, half-brutalized peasantry,' as they call us, and you may learn to despise us like the rest."</p> 
               <p>"No, no;" I utterly disclaimed such a possibility.</p> 
               <p>"Well, it would only be natural. There is little to love about us, I will own. But who made us so?" he cried, with a sudden fierceness of energy. "Not the God above us-surely not, such work is done in this world. Olive, I think the very brutes are happier than we are. They have no dreams nor desires, they only suffer when cold and hungry, they lick the hand of the giver when plenty comes. But we are not all brutes," he groaned; "though, because we cannot eat the food they give us, and grovel behind the walls of their pastures, they drive us into the shambles, as ugly, refractory beasts, fit only for the knife."</p> 
               <p>"But this is all folly," said he, after a pause; "all folly, Olive, to be troubling a girl like you with this."</p> 
               <p>"No, no, it is not folly," I said, hurriedly. "I am learning more and more, and thinking more and more about these things every day, father. I know I am but a helpless girl, but-but were I a man-"</p> 
               <p>"Stop, stop," said my father with a quick laugh, his native humor touched with my bravado, "this is treason. Why, my brave little girl, these loyal supporters of his most gracious majesty may thank their good fortune that fate has it otherwise."</p> 
               <p>"Now don't laugh," I said, somewhat hurt.</p> 
               <p>"I will not again, indeed," answered my father, as, putting his broad hand on my shoulder, he said with loving kindness, "You are a good, warm-hearted girl,<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5593-00000057"/> my own true daughter, and becoming a fine lady has not spoiled your generous nature. But the plain facts of the case are these: Many years ago, before you were born, I leased a bit of land, a few acres, the owner of which had always lived in England. When I took the ground it was a poor, barren spot; stony, bleak, without bush or tree; but I was young and hopeful then, and I went to work with a will. I picked out all the stones, made a neat wall with them all around my place, raised my little cabin, cultivated my ground, and had as nice a spot as was seen in the country round,-was it not, Walter?"</p> 
               <p>"True for you," was the answer; "there was not another place like it."</p> 
               <p>"Well, all this time, with all I could do, I was but just able to keep body and soul together. What with rent to pay, and taxes and tithes, there was little left to clothe, and feed us. Indeed, the chickens and eggs my wife sold, and the cow and the pig, were about all we held our own. Still we kept along and were not beholden to any one. But, about a year ago, my lease ran out; and then word came that my rent was doubled; and when I expostulated, they said if I could not pay, there were others stood ready to take the place. Had the landlord been here, and if he was a gentleman, I could have talked with him, and told him of the hardship of the thing, and how I had really made the place, and was paying a rent that took all I could get out of it, and what could I do more? but he was away; he knew nothing about us, and what did his agent care?</p> 
               <p>"Well, I stayed on, hoping against hope, that something might turn up, and when the six months came<pb n=""/> round I paid a little and begged off for awhile. Another six months passed; I was no better off, but I sold everything I could rake and scrape. I sold the cow, the pigs, the chickens, but all I could get together was little towards the amount required. Olive, it ended that all I had, even to the bed we lay on, was taken, and I was turned out. All my saving and hard labor for so many years would only serve the young masters and misses in London for a day's feast, but they got it. Justice-the devil's justice, not God's-said it was theirs and not ours. They say that many of the landowners are coming back to look after their estates; they are scared at the way things look. But it is too late; the mischief is done; they can't stop it now with soft speeches. Do they think we are fools to be wheedled by their proclamations? They have given us ten days to give up our guns and our pikes, and return to the loving fold of our protectors. Ha! ha!"</p> 
               <p>My, father's laugh, full of bitter meaning, made my blood tingle. It seemed to ring with death and danger.</p> 
               <p>"It seems to me, father," said I, "that if you were to represent the cause of all these poor people-"</p> 
               <p>"And," said my father, turning to Walter, and paying no heed to my words, "and if we do not give up our arms, what does my lord lieutenant say through his fast friend and abettor, Lord Castlereagh? Why, forsooth, if we do not, the soldiery will be let loose on us, our cabins will be searched, the utmost penalties of the law will be ours. And what does even our own most Catholic bishop of this diocese say to all this? He desires his priests to declare the heinousness of attempting to subvert the government of his most<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5593-00000058"/> gracious majesty. He bids us not be misled by wretched speculations on the rights of man, or the majesty of the people-fatal heresies-disastrous theories he calls them."</p> 
               <p>"Fatal they are, indeed," said Walter, "to the shame of our rulers be it spoken."</p> 
               <p>"Why go on?" said my father; "words are useless, weapons are what we want; when even among our own spiritual fathers place and power have such strong influence, and they speak from interest rather than principle."</p> 
               <p>Unable to restrain myself, and alarmed at the bitterness with which he spoke, I laid my hand upon his arm to interrupt the fierce torrent of words. He looked down upon me kindly, his face and voice softening instantly.</p> 
               <p>"Have I frightened you, my little girl?" he said, soothingly. "Well, well, do not mind all I say, child. I am vindictive,-I cannot help it,-but be sure I will never dishonor you, Olive, by word or deed; nor will I dishonor myself."</p> 
               <p>He stooped and kissed me, and we parted.</p> 
               <p>This interview left me distressed and miserable. Walter, as we walked to the Hall, was very kind and gentle, and endeavored to comfort me by showing the most hopeful side of affairs. He had gotten over the ill-humor of the afternoon, and begged that I would forgive his apparent rudeness.</p> 
               <p>To be sure I would forgive him-I had hardly felt anger, I said,-I was only sorry that he should feel so hard towards Arthur. There was no reply to this for some minutes. Walter paused an instant in his walk.<pb n=""/> I heard him sigh; it was almost a stifled groan. Then he said, in a singularly subdued voice, "Olive, I will deem it a favor if you will never mention that name to me again."</p> 
               <p>I was surprised. Never mention his name! why, it seemed to me the most natural thing in the world to speak of Arthur.</p> 
               <p>I suppose that the moonlight shining down upon us revealed the expression of my face, for he said, hastily, "No, you cannot understand it; do not try. Good-night."</p> 
               <p>We were now at the Hall, and, shaking hands, we parted.</p> 
               <milestone n="" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>That night I lay long awake, uneasy and excited. My father's desperate state of mind filled me with anxiety; it seemed to me that he might be tempted to commit some violence. And then Walter was so strangely whimsical,-sometimes so sympathizing that I felt like telling him every thought, again so hasty, harsh, and inconsiderate, that my heart utterly withdrew from him. Weary and full of misgivings, I tossed about until morning, resolved that at the very earliest opportunity I would ride over to see Mr. Massarene, and talk with him about my father.</p> 
               <p>Everything in the morning proved favorable to my plan. Sir Robert, with his wife and daughter, were going in the carriage to make a formal visit to a new neighbor, or rather to welcome an old one, a Mr. Neville, who had, with his family, been residing for many years in England. This family had returned to occupy their long-deserted mansion, now almost in<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5593-00000059"/> ruins, because the extravagance of its growing sons and daughters and the expenses of London life could no longer be supported from their Irish estates. They had come to Ireland to retrench. Many others, as I have intimated, were doing the like at this time.</p> 
               <p>This Mr. Neville was, I conjectured, from the similarity of the name, the very landlord who had brought such distress on my father. This raising of the rents on his estate in Kildare had given great dissatisfaction.</p> 
               <p>"But," said Sir Robert, as he stood at the door, waiting for his carriage, "I consider that every one must manage his own affairs. I think he has been guilty of gross injustice, however; and, although I make it a point of etiquette to call on him, I must say I consider the man a great rascal."</p> 
               <p>Lady Grace did not appear to hear this; she was occupied in adjusting her robe.</p> 
               <p>I thought to myself that it was a great pity Sir Robert, with his assured reputation and standing, could not be independent, and manifest his disapproval of wrong and injustice when he saw it so clearly.</p> 
               <p>I did not delay an instant after their departure; my pony was quickly saddled, and I set out on the road to Mr. Massarene's.</p> 
               <p>It was a lovely morning in the month of November, a season which, in this climate, is generally damp and misty; this year, however, it had been remarkably clear and bracing. The air was delicious, and everything that met my eye seemed lovely,-the undulating landscape of hill and valley, the changing leaves, the sparkling waters beyond,-all these were inspiring; my spirits rose; the depression of the previous night<pb n=""/> vanished as I cantered along the winding road; nor were they very much dampened even when, turning into the lane leading up to the abbey, I encountered the monk whom Florence and I had seen on the day when we visited old Doughty. His down-looking countenance, passing a woman with averted eye, as though she were an evil thing, had provoked Florence to mirth and an unwonted expression of disdain; and, as he moved silently on, without sign of recognition, I could not avoid a certain chill sensation, not the result of the November atmosphere.</p> 
               <p>As I entered the archway and passed into the courtyard, I saw in front of the main entrance two footmen, in showy livery, pacing up and down.</p> 
               <p>"This must be some visitor of distinction," said I to myself, holding the reins suspended, undecided what to do.</p> 
               <p>But it was decided for me. A servant came from the house; Mr. Massarene had seen me and desired that I should come in.</p> 
               <p>I was ushered into the small sitting-room, and found myself in the presence of Mr. Massarene, his sister Annastene, and their visitor, who was introduced to me as Father Bochera. A high dignitary evidently was the father, and a foreigner,-a refined and courtly personage, perhaps somewhat older than Mr. Massarene. He bowed low and with condescending grace when I was presented, and taking my hand with a kind and fatherly pressure, said that I was the first young Irish lady to whom he had had the honor of being introduced; adding that my blooming cheeks spoke well for the healthfulness of the sea-girt island.</p> 
               <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5593-00000060"/> 
               <p>Of course I was confused and fluttered; my native shyness, as usual, turning traitor to my self-possession. Mr. Massarene, however, spoke for me, and I heard him mention my father's name in an undertone, at which the reverend gentleman scanned me more closely, and said, "Is it possible!"</p> 
               <p>I seated myself beside the Lady Annastene, who smiled upon me pleasantly as I took the low ottoman at her feet; while the two gentlemen resumed, in a low tone, the conversation apparently interrupted by my entrance.</p> 
               <p>"Are they talking of us, my dear?" whispered the poor old lady. A certain confidence, if it might so be called, had grown up between this lady and myself, though we seldom saw each other. She always, in our visits, seemed to prefer me to Florence, perhaps because I was more sedate. Old age was now telling upon her; she was no longer so haughty and irritable as in former days; her nerves were quieter. With a priest from Rome before her, the representative of her beloved religion, she sat with the sunlight glancing in on her silken train and splendid toilet,-dress was even now her passion,-the personification of rest and trust. It had become evident to me that she had a certain terror of Sister Theresa, a terror expressed unconsciously in her actions, and she would take my hand at times in her helpless way, as if it gave her strength and a sense of protection. Occasionally I was sent for; and her brother, whose attention to her wants never abated, seemed well pleased when I answered the summons.</p> 
               <p>I liked well to be with these two. The trust and friendship of the lonely woman, the intelligent conversation<pb n=""/> sation of the brother, gave me a better feeling towards myself, and a more restful and satisfied spirit than I ever felt elsewhere. For, indeed, the questions of the times, the exciting themes of the day, pressed sore on my youthful heart, and made me feel, at times, utterly dissatisfied with my quiescent and questionable position. I longed to be doing something to help this striving, struggling world, and to lighten the misery, which, shut from my actual experience, was yet evident to my observation.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Massarene talked much with me over the topics which then absorbed the thinking minds of the country, and I felt honored by his confidence,-a confidence which drew us together in closer bonds of friendship than are usual between youth and later life.</p> 
               <p>This morning it was evident that some important projects were in discussion. I could hear the persuasive voice of the churchman occasionally rising in expostulation, and, as I thought, the still obstinate refusal of his host. I had taken up a book of prints, endeavoring to keep my attention from themes not meant for my ear; and the Lady Annastene, lulled by the hum of low voices, had fallen asleep in her chair.</p> 
               <p>At last the visitor rose to take leave. As he wrapped about him more closely the dark cloak that had enveloped him from head to foot, I caught a glimpse, beneath it, of a long, scarlet robe.</p> 
               <p>In fact, as I learned afterwards, this courtly gentleman was no other than Cardinal Bochera, who had come to Ireland on a secret mission to the influential Catholics of the country.</p> 
               <p>On the departure of the august visitor, I expressed<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5593-00000061"/> regret that Lady Annastene had not been awake to receive his parting blessing.</p> 
               <p>"He may be here again," was the answer; "we did not part satisfactorily. However, do not let us say anything to my sister about it. I doubt if she will remember his being here at all when she wakes."</p> 
               <p>"Poor lady!" I sighed; "perhaps there may be some vague impression, as if a bright dream or vision had passed before her."</p> 
               <p>"Probably," said her brother. "Happy is she in her profound and childlike adoration of all connected with her faith,-we need not grieve for her."</p> 
               <p>"Surely not," I replied, sympathetically. But, returning to my own perplexities, I added, "I could not avoid hearing my father's name mentioned by that gentleman; what may he know about him? and my poor father is in such trouble, and going away. It was that brought me here this morning."</p> 
               <p>"Has he gone?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; he went last night."</p> 
               <p>"About this person, knowing him and his movements, I am as puzzled as any. I fear there are traitors around-but who, that is the question. This father has been in the country but a few hours, and yet he knows names and circumstances-it is astonishing."</p> 
               <p>"May not that strange friar have told him?" I suggested.</p> 
               <p>"What strange friar?"</p> 
               <p>"That disagreeable Italian monk," I answered, with a shudder.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, one of your antipathies;" and he smiled. "But you are wrong this time. He is away; left some<pb n=""/> days ago for Boulogne, where your father is to meet him, and together they will go to Paris; he is to act as interpreter."</p> 
               <p>"He is not gone," I interrupted, hurriedly. "I saw him passing out of the lane as I came in a few moments ago."</p> 
               <p>"Is it possible! Are you sure?"</p> 
               <p>"Perfectly sure."</p> 
               <p>"This looks bad," was the thoughtful rejoinder, "very bad. Now I remember; our visitor was called out, some person wished to see him outside the walls. It must have been so, Olive. The monk has told him all; there has indeed been treachery."</p> 
               <p>"And is my poor father in danger by it? Do, Mr. Massarene, tell me," I said, in great distress.</p> 
               <p>"I will tell you, Olive," he replied, with one of his pleasant, approving looks; "but it is not every one of your age whom I would trust so far; you are strong, however, and clear-headed, and willing, I think, to undergo some pain for your country's sake."</p> 
               <p>I could only answer with my tears.</p> 
               <p>"It is a difficult matter,-very complicated,-but I will endeavor to explain. There is a secret society existing; you may have heard of it."</p> 
               <p>I said I had; Walter had told me about it.</p> 
               <p>"It is called 'The United Irishmen,' this among themselves. Its aims are to free the country from a galling yoke; to have, as in the new world, a republic, a free government, where political and religious freedom, with just and equal rights, will be secured to all. The intention of the society, at its commencement, was to do this without violence; to wait until strong<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5593-00000062"/> enough, and then by a united, persistent, moral force, to gain their object.</p> 
               <p>"At one time it really seemed as if this might be done; for in its organization are comprised some of the highest, best, and most enlightened elements of the country; in its ranks are the rich and poor of every sect and creed, who, without distinction, are willing to throw aside all minor differences for the general good. But lately the government, long cognizant of the society, but never able to reach it, has determined to use vigorous measures to extirpate it if possible.</p> 
               <p>"There is now a reign of terror fully inaugurated; no one feels safe. The jails are crowded with state prisoners. Martial law is proclaimed. The habeas corpus act is suspended. Then there is the gunpowder bill to disarm the people; the convention bill to prevent their assembling to remonstrate; in fact, everything is done, as it were, to goad them on to a sudden outbreak of fury, as it is felt that, in their present unprepared state, they could then be utterly crushed. So now their only hope is from outside aid; France has promised it. Alas! I fear it will be but a frail support. There are those there actively at work. Documents and statements must be furnished them. Your father has been chosen to carry these; his honesty and devotion are well known; and then, from his humble position, he is not as likely to be missed as one more prominent."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, I see it now!" I said, with a heavy sigh.</p> 
               <p>"The matter might be quite safe," he continued, "but the treachery of this priest may jeopardize the lives of all concerned. What a rascal! I must take some<pb n=""/> means to counteract his efforts, at least to let those here look out for their safety."</p> 
               <p>"And this holy father,-what can he have to do with it?"</p> 
               <p>"It may be he fears this heterogeneous element that is astir, and, with the barbarous reasoning of some, holds to the sacrifice of the few here for the good of the many hereafter; but I don't know, at any rate I will have nothing to do with it. You know, Olive, my family have always been Catholic, and suffered sadly for their faith. Fines and confiscations, in their strict adherence to it, have brought our once broad lands to the few acres around these old walls; but I would rather let all go, yea, and my life, too, than have this fair island brought under ecclesiastical rule. We have, alas! had too much of it already."</p> 
               <p>A great sadness was over Mr. Massarene as I parted from him. And with a heavy heart, full of forebodings, I returned to the Hall.</p> 
            </div>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE RETURN.</head> 
               <p>THE lingering hours drifted slowly away. It was getting towards twilight. On this day of days, full of excitement, full of expectation, the young heir of the house was waited for with love and honor befitting a young prince, and still he delayed. Sir Robert and Lady Grace could not conceal their impatience, and Florence and myself were glad when the arrival of Major Trenchard helped to divert our thoughts for a time.</p> 
               <p>At length the sound of wheels was heard. All rushed eagerly to the portico; but the lumbering vehicle turned off to the back entrance,-it was only the carriage with the luggage. On the box, however, sat Arthur's valet and Adele's spruce little maid. These, at least, brought news of the lingerers. They were on their way, would be with us soon, the cause of detention being that Mr. Fortescue, a younger brother accompanying Adele, had stopped at the Castle in Dublin, with papers from the government that must be at once delivered. With this excuse, of course, we were obliged to be satisfied; but the hours of waiting passed slowly and wearily as we lingered outside, the beauty of the cool, clear sunset, as it bathed everything around in its soft golden light, scarcely exciting our slightest attention.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>But hark! again there is the distant sound of wheels out on the road. Surely this time they are come. Yes, this time there was no mistake. The great post-chaise, with its foaming chargers, dashed up the drive.</p> 
               <p>At this moment a deadly faintness came over me; my head reeled; I felt as if I must sink to the floor. I could not remain thus to welcome the expected guests,-impossible! Unobserved, I glided back to the Hall, and through the drawing-room out to a side balcony, in the hope of regaining command of myself.</p> 
               <p>I heard them alight. I heard the glad words of welcome; and presently I heard Arthur's voice, quick, impatient, asking where was Olive.</p> 
               <p>"Where, indeed?" echoed Florence. "She was here a moment since."</p> 
               <p>A step sounded on the floor of the drawing-room. I knew the step. There was no time for escape. Passing through the open window out on the balcony where I had taken refuge, Arthur stood before me.</p> 
               <p>He must have imagined the cause of my absence, for he made no complaint, but, taking both my hands in his, he said, "My own dear Olive, I am blest in seeing you at last!"</p> 
               <p>I know not how I replied. The look which accompanied these words, the touch of the hands, the old, familiar voice, thrilled me with an exquisite joy. Like one in a dream, I passed through the necessary introductions, greetings, and compliments.</p> 
               <p>Adele met me with gay good-humor. "Is it possible," she said, glancing brightly over my face and<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5593-00000064"/> person, "this is my old antagonist? But how pale you look, and how you tremble!"</p> 
               <p>I now raised my eyes to hers, determined to throw off my embarrassment, and answer as I should her prompt salutations.</p> 
               <p>That instantaneous glance revealed to me a fact which covered me with confusion. I saw that Adele had discovered my secret,-a secret scarce known, at least scarce acknowledged, to myself, and certainly never suspected by those about me. She knew that I loved Arthur,-that this was no common meeting.</p> 
               <p>Oh, the humility of having all I had held thus sacred brought so rudely to light!</p> 
               <p>But I must command myself. I called in the aid of my pride, and, with a powerful effort, succeeded in regaining composure. I recalled the time when this same Adele held such a freezing control over me, when every faculty of my being seemed to stagnate in her presence, and I resolved it should not be so again. Indeed, I had no right to charge her with any attempt to distress me. She was all frankness and joyousness, and the ease and pleasure she evinced soon diffused its influence on every side.</p> 
               <p>When the travel dispersed to their dressing-rooms to rest and refresh themselves after their journey, the family comments began. Lady Grace thought Adele charming, and Sir Robert declared her a splendid-looking girl, though rather too self-assured for his taste. Major Trenchard pronounced her glorious.</p> 
               <p>"But no one says anything about Arthur," cried Florence. "When he was at home, and always with us I did not think how he looked; but now I see him<pb n=""/> as others would, and I think he is very handsome. Don't you, Olive,-though I remember you always like dark complexions, and Arthur is very light, but so clear and fair and striking. Major Trenchard, I know you will agree with me that Arthur is handsome, very handsome."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly," whispered the gallant major. "I could not think otherwise when he so much resembles his lovely sister."</p> 
               <p>Whereat Florence frowned playfully, blushing the while, and declaring that these compliments were not to her taste.</p> 
               <p>How beautiful she looked sitting there, her eyes beaming upon the man she loved, her face lit with a happy smile!</p> 
               <p>Yes, these two were happy, I thought. The world laid its treasures at their feet,-love and wealth and honor. For me my one first hour of half-acknowledged love dawned in misery and anxiety. Not as a prince, whose right it was to reign, crowned, honored, and fted, came my love to me, but rather as one sore pressed, with face averted, disguised, distressed, a fugitive; almost, it seemed, a traitor.</p> 
               <p>By the time that dinner was announced I had, however, recovered my composure. Whatever might be the result, I was resolved not to betray any weakness.</p> 
               <p>Adele, in full dress, now entered the dining-hall resplendent in her charms. She had certainly grown to wonderful elegance of appearance and bearing. Hardly to be called handsome, she nevertheless commanded admiration by a grace and fascination of style which is often more attractive than beauty.</p> 
               <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5593-00000065"/> 
               <p>I could not help gazing upon her with some surprise as I recalled the ungainly and awkward girl of former days.</p> 
               <p>Perhaps this feeling was reciprocated by the fair Adele. Certain it is that I underwent at her hands a curious and circumspect examination, as though she were searching for the secret which had worked my transformation. All this, however, under a mask of playful interest and the frankest friendliness. Adele was evidently a woman of the world, an adept in its ways and wisdom.</p> 
               <p>We all found her charming during the dinner hour. She was so overflowing with wit and repartee that the whole party became inspired with unusual gayety. Even Sir Robert and the dignified Lady Grace joined in the general hilarity. During the evening we had music; Adele, whose voice was really a splendid one, sitting at the piano until it was nearly time to retire, when we separated, apparently in fine spirits.</p> 
               <p>"How do you like her?" was the first question of Florence as we sat undressing by the fire in our cozy little chamber. This was the time for all our secret communings, when we spoke as freely as we thought, knowing that the words of each were sacred to the other, locked up from the outer world as surely as though never uttered.</p> 
               <p>"How do I like her?" I repeated. "Why, she is very agreeable. Don't you think so?"</p> 
               <p>Florence sat musing an instant, and then answered, in her usual frank way, "Yes, she is agreeable and handsome, and talented, I should say; but-it is hardly fair to be governed by one's impressions-but I<pb n=""/> don't like her, Olive; no, I really do not. Her despotic manner, her perfect self-possession, are not to my taste. How constantly she exacted the attention of Arthur and Major Trenchard during the whole evening! One must turn the leaves of her music and one must accompany her with his voice. I do think it was really unfeeling, when Arthur had been away so long; and then I was left to entertain that conceited Mr. Fortescue. But pshaw!" said Florence, suddenly repenting, as was her habit after any little outbreak of temper or fault-finding, "how I have been talking! I think the trouble must be with myself, Olive. Everything seems to be wrong with me tonight. Never mind; to-morrow we shall have Arthur all to ourselves."</p> 
               <p>But to-morrow brought its own engagements. Adele, either at the hotel where they landed from the packet or at the one where they had stopped to dine, had left a box of jewelry,-very valuable jewelry, it appeared,-about which she was very much alarmed. We all sympathized with her. The missing casket must be searched for without delay. Sir Robert offered to send his faithful man of business to hunt it up, but Adele objected. People at hotels were so cunning; the gems might have been stolen by the servants, and unless skillful management was made use of they might never be recovered.</p> 
               <p>In this dilemma, Major Trenchard, who had ridden over early in the morning, volunteered his services, saying that he was free for the day. But then Arthur must accompany him, that was admitted; the gallant major must have a companion, and Arthur knew where<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5593-00000066"/> they had been. It was absolutely necessary he should go.</p> 
               <p>"Why would not Mr. Fortescue answer?" timidly suggested Florence. "He, too, was with them."</p> 
               <p>But Mr. Fortescue knew nothing of the country or people,-could not be ready for any emergency that might occur. Arthur must go: the fates had, it seemed, decreed it so; and so for another day we gave him up.</p> 
               <p>But Adele made amends for his absence. She certainly was a great acquisition to a quiet country-house. She had so much to tell us of the gay world outside, was so full of life and animation, and her brother proved himself so much more agreeable than we had anticipated, that, with a walk in the park and a visit to the conservatories, we got through the day quite pleasantly.</p> 
               <p>The gentlemen did not return until quite late, and were so much fatigued that they retired immediately to their rooms, Major Trenchard remaining all night.</p> 
               <p>Adele was profuse in her expressions of gratitude on meeting the gentlemen next morning.</p> 
               <p>The major was obliged to ride over to the barracks very early; he must be there before midday. It was such a lovely morning. "Let us all go," said Adele. "I am dying to see the old castle and the quarters of the garrison. My brother will be there soon, you know. I hear you have such a splendid view of the ocean from the heights. Come, do let us go!" Of course, the major joined in the request. No matter how urgent or important his own business might be, this gentleman was never known to neglect the behests of a lady.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>But Florence had been forbidden to ride on horseback until her cold was better, and I would not go if she did not. Still Adele persisted. The day was too beautiful to be thrown away, she said, with so much longing in her animated face that no one could gainsay her; and Arthur must accompany them, because young Mr. Fortescue would not know the way back.</p> 
               <p>"I should be lost under his protecting care," said the young lady, smiling, and showing her pearl-white teeth. "He is as absent-minded as any old philosopher; aren't you, Tom?"</p> 
               <p>Tom kindly assented to this description of his youthful peculiarity, and Arthur went.</p> 
               <p>So another day went by, for the party did not return until nearly nightfall. There had been so much to see, so many departments to visit, and some dear, delightful old officers they had met abroad had insisted on their staying to luncheon, and the ruins of the old rock-fortress were <emph>so</emph> interesting! What strongholds those old Irish kings protected their royalty in, to be sure!</p> 
               <p>But this was only a beginning. Every day there were new plans. The country in every direction was to be explored, all its picturesque spots and old ruins visited, and, not least nor last, there were such glorious sea-side rides. Adele was a practiced horsewoman, and her health and spirits were unfailing. She must have Arthur with her to lead and direct; her brother was no horseman, he must stay at home and entertain the ladies; and, as it would not answer for Arthur and Adele to go on these excursions alone, why Major Trenchard must accompany them. Florence,<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5593-00000067"/> too, insisted that he should; she would not have him shut up in the house for her sake, when he enjoyed horseback exercise so much.</p> 
               <p>Thus it went on day after day, until we at last gave up all hope of having Arthur, as of old, our own property, Adele was in her element, and was, by her buoyancy, spirit, and ever-ready wit, fast becoming a general favorite. Her enthusiastic praises of the country even won the heart of Sir Robert, who, an ardent lover of his native land, found it a pleasant thing to hear its praises sounded from the lips of a stranger.</p> 
               <p>One soft, sunshiny morning, Lady Grace proposed that the ladies should take the close carriage and make a few long-delayed calls in the neighborhood. Florence could join them, thus protected from the air, without detriment to her health, and the gentlemen could accompany the party on horseback.</p> 
               <p>Florence was pining for outer air, having been kept in-doors for many weeks by an obstinate cold. Well wrapped up, and with her soft eyes beaming upon her attendant lover, she descended to the carriage. We were about ready to start, when Adele suddenly discovered that she could not ride in a close carriage; it always made her sick. She would take her brother's horse, and he could take her seat in the vehicle.</p> 
               <p>There was no changing her plan; and so, after a little delay, a side-saddle was brought, and she galloped off in company with the gentlemen.</p> 
               <p>I saw Florence turn pale as Major Trenchard rode gayly by, touching his hat to her as he passed to join those in front. Perhaps she thought he would have guided his horse so as to remain near her; and then<pb n=""/> she had been ill, and was so used to being petted and indulged that, having made this effort to come, she was disappointed that he took it so lightly. But she soon rallied. She was too unselfish to allow the pleasure of others to be overclouded by her gloom, and we soon had a laugh at the expense of Mr. Fortescue, who, snugly ensconced in the corner of the carriage, gave vent every now and then to an unguarded exclamation of surprise at what he saw.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, ah! really, now, I thought-I had heard, I mean-that your houses in the country districts were built mostly of mud, and here are some noble-yes, noble-specimens of architecture," pointing to a few fine country-seats in the distance.</p> 
               <p>Even Lady Grace smiled, though she checked by a look the continuance of Florence's mirthfulness.</p> 
               <p>But we must return; Florence was getting very tired. We had made a few short calls, and Mr. Fortescue expressed himself as charmed and bewildered by the beauty and grace of the young ladies to whom he was introduced. "Deuced fine girls, 'pon honor!" which was generally the extent of his encomiums. In ability, social qualities, and worldly polish this young man suffered in comparison with his brilliant sister. He accepted his position as a sort of attendant in her train with an innocence and quietness which should, doubtless, rank among his good qualities.</p> 
               <p>Our companions, who preferred going on to calling with us, were now far out of sight, and we drove back to the Hall without them. It was some hours before they returned, overflowing with good spirits, and declaring they had never seen such a glorious day.</p> 
               <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5593-00000068"/> 
               <p>I saw that Florence was wounded, she could not conceal it from me; but she only complained of being fatigued. Not all Major Trenchard's devoted attention during the evening, nor his expressions of regret that she had over-exerted herself, could restore her to her usual light-heartedness. She was weary and listless, and she and I retired early.</p> 
               <p>When in our own room neither of us seemed at first disposed to speak; there are some feelings too tender, too sensitively shrinking, to bear utterance. Thus we sat in silence until I saw the great tears roll down the sweet face of my companion, and then I rose and threw my arms around her, and she laid her head on my shoulder and sobbed like a little child. Oh, how freely I could have wept with her! "Olive," she said, "I am hurt, my heart is sore."</p> 
               <p>"I know it is, dear."</p> 
               <p>"Why, why is it," she added, "that I have felt so unhappy ever since Adele has been here? Is it that I have changed? I used to love everybody, and everybody looked kindly on me; but now I am suspicious, easily offended, and dissatisfied with myself and every one else. I just feel as if I could cry, cry, and still it does not ease me."</p> 
               <p>I could have answered, and did in my inmost thoughts, that some have the genius of spreading discontent, as some have of diffusing love, where all are unconscious from whence it comes; but I only replied, "There is one thing, Florence; you must assert yourself more decidedly. There are some persons who can only understand timidity as inferiority."</p> 
               <p>"You are right, Olive," she answered quickly, as if<pb n=""/> stirred with a new idea. "I <emph>have</emph> been weak, indeed; I see it plainly now. I will be so no longer, and you must help me, Olive. Adele does not understand our courtesy toward our guests; she has mistaken our hospitality, our giving way to her in everything, for a tacit acknowledgment of her own superiority. We have allowed her to go forward, direct, and assume authority until she has forgotten her position, I think."</p> 
               <p>I smiled at my companion's impetuosity, and said some soothing words; but Florence was now fully roused, and paid no heed.</p> 
               <p>"It vexes me beyond expression," she said, the color rising to her delicate cheeks, "to feel her condescending manner-her kindly patronage of me; as if I were a pretty doll. I hate her compliments, her anxious solicitude, her overwhelming apologies. Oh, she is false, false! I know it, and yet everybody is blind, I think; even-" She checked herself; the name of Major Trenchard she could not and would not mention, though perhaps his interest in the charming newcomer was one secret source of my friend's irritation.</p> 
               <p>"Do you know," said she, laughing, as she lifted her head with a pretty haughtiness, "she actually apologized to me for the constant attention paid her by our visitors! It pained her, forsooth, when she was well aware that <emph>I</emph> was the person entitled to them. Think of that, Olive! when it is so evident that her efforts are all directed to that end."</p> 
               <p>But Florence stopped. She had already expended her brief indignation. She began to make apologies: "I am sorry I cannot like Adele; I have tried, you know I have, Olive; and you know, too, that I would<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5593-00000069"/> not talk about her in this way to any one else. And she is mamma's near relative, too; and mamma thinks so well of her."</p> 
               <p>Our "plan," as Florence designated it, was carried out. The next evening, when music was proposed, she led the way to the music-room, and, sitting down at the piano, played a brilliant bravura. There were but few visitors, and all seemed astonished to find the usually retiring Florence so fine a performer. Major Trenchard and Arthur were delighted, and as she and I joined in singing some old Irish melodies, there rose in the room a pleasant murmur very like applause.</p> 
               <p>Our recreant knights became our slaves again for the time at least, and Florence looked happy.</p> 
               <p>I will confess to having made unusual exertions that evening, and to feeling the exultation of a not very amiable pride when complimented on the richness and purity of my voice. I knew Adele was listening. This, I will own, was not a respectable motive; it was mean, and I felt ashamed of it; but I knew, notwithstanding the civilities which passed between that young lady and myself, that Adele was my determined enemy.</p> 
               <p>Arthur seemed bent upon conversing with me this evening. He seated himself near me upon the sofa, his arm resting upon the back of it. "Olive," said he, reproachfully, but speaking in so low a voice that it could reach no ear save my own, "Olive, why have you so persistently avoided me since my return home?"</p> 
               <p>"Avoided you!" I repeated in astonishment.</p> 
               <p>"Yes. It was a cruel return for all the months I have given to constant thought of you, and lived upon the hope of meeting you again.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"I too have waited," I stammered out, scarce knowing what to say in my excitement.</p> 
               <p>"But you did not meet me as I met you; and since then, Olive, I have noticed a constant restraint and desire to avoid me."</p> 
               <p>Oh, if he could only understand the depth of emotion with which my heart responded to his voice! But I could not speak; I could not explain.</p> 
               <p>Arthur saw my agitation; and, I think, somewhat understood it, for he continued more tenderly: "I know, Olive, you were never very demonstrative in your actions, nor very profuse in your words of affection; but I always did imagine you loved me a little,-just a very little."</p> 
               <p>I could scarcely restrain my tears.</p> 
               <p>"I see we are watched," said he, abruptly, yet speaking still lower; "but whisper, Olive; whisper this to me, and I will bide my time; tell me that it was not any falling off of esteem that has made you shun me; say this, Olive, only this!"</p> 
               <p>"Say it!" I repeated, vehemently, my voice choking with the violence of my suppressed feelings, "say it! Yes, a hundred and a hundred times I will-"</p> 
               <p>At that moment Adele came up, all smiles and courtesy, to say that they were going to dance, and his mother wished him to lead with Lady Mary Chichester.</p> 
               <p>He left me, but I was happy. Oh, the joy, the heartfelt peace of those few hours, brief, flitting, as they were! Neither time nor circumstance can altogether efface their memory. Arthur loved me. He had not said it in words, but I knew it full well. It seemed that evening, with all the light and brilliance<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5593-00000070"/> about me, the hum of voices, the graceful movement of the dance, the rising and falling music, it seemed as though I was bathed in some strange, delicious atmosphere, which nothing earthy could penetrate; an aroma, as of a soul come newly into bloom, shed itself about me. I walked and moved apart from the rest of the world; not to be approached, depressed, or irritated longer by its petty cares or joys.</p> 
               <p>Not even was I greatly disturbed when a whispered conversation among a group, of which Adele was the centre, caught my ear, and sent the blood tingling to my cheeks. At that moment, though excited, I was too much etherealized to suffer.</p> 
               <p>The party was being made acquainted, as others had sedulously been, with the fact of my peasant origin. Suppressed exclamations, lady-like oh's and ah's, and sidewise glances over fair shoulders, indicated that I was being weighed in the balance.</p> 
               <p>"And she owes everything to the bounty of dear Lady Grace!" "Is it possible!" and "How independently she carries herself," and "One can see it after all her pride of bearing," were among the encouraging comments that reached my ears in the musical accents, and soft, harmonious voices, of unquestionable birth and breeding.</p> 
               <p>But what did I care, to-night? I was a plebeian, but my love was divine. And, after all, perhaps these things were wholesome reminders; for among these dear good friends, and with Florence always beside me, I was in danger of forgetting that I was in truth a peasant's daughter.</p> 
               <p>On the following morning, at the breakfast-table,<pb n=""/> Lady Grace casually remarked that she hoped Walter's conservatories would furnish her an abundant supply this evening, both of fruit and flowers.</p> 
               <p>Walter was now head gardener at the Hall.</p> 
               <p>"Walter!" repeated Arthur, with some vexation, "that is too bad. I have not seen him since I came home. He is one of the finest fellows in the world; I used to love him as a brother."</p> 
               <p>"As a brother!" laughed Adele, "and who next will be your sister? Shall I introduce you to my pretty maid?"</p> 
               <p>Arthur colored, but Lady Grace hastily interrupted any unpleasantness by saying that as Adele had not yet seen the conservatories or hot-houses, we might all pay them a visit, and, if scientifically inclined, we would find Walter most intelligent in giving us information.</p> 
               <p>"Do you know, Arthur," she added, "that some of his written statements about our native plants have received high commendation from the 'National Horticultural Society'?"</p> 
               <p>Of course we were all ready to go. We only waited Major Trenchard's arrival. "Wrap yourself up well, Florence," said her careful mother, for Florence was not yet off the sick list, and her cough was a subject of some anxiety to those who loved her. Bright and delicate as a dream, there was, however, nothing of the sick-room atmosphere about the young girl; she was neither depressed nor depressing.</p> 
               <p>Arthur gave me his arm, and Adele was left to the gallantry of her brother, whom she always snubbed without mercy. But she revenged herself on the party<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5593-00000071"/> by taking exclusive possession of Walter. There was so much to learn, so much to see! Oh, what an attractive field of knowledge! And as they passed and repassed us in the flower-bordered alleys, she wore quite an air of triumph.</p> 
               <p>But I saw or thought of little else than Arthur, on whose arm I hung. At his side, listening to his voice, a delicious delirium steeped my senses. At some future time it might be-some far future time-this cup of joy must be put from me. But now, now let me taste its nectar, uncaring, with youthful inconsequence, whatever might come hereafter.</p> 
               <p>Walter and Arthur met rather coolly. But I blamed Walter for this. Arthur had gathered a few flowers for me, and was in the act of putting them in my hand, when Walter and Adele approached.</p> 
               <p>I said, playfully, "Walter, will you allow this-that we should pluck your flowers without so much as saying 'by your leave'?"</p> 
               <p>Walter made no answer, and looking up I saw in his face an expression so strange that it pained and puzzled me. It might be bitterness, it might be hate; I shuddered and turned away. Why did he fix his eyes upon me so strangely? Was he, too, thinking that I was growing forgetful of my plebeian origin?</p> 
               <p>Neither Arthur nor Adele noticed this by-play; they had turned away at the moment to examine some rare and curious plant which hung its fragrant festoons just beyond us.</p> 
               <p>I was glad when all proposed to leave, and we had turned to go home.</p> 
               <p>A few hundred feet beyond the conservatories rose<pb n=""/> a gentle eminence commanding an extensive view. Many legends of old times were connected with this spot. Tradition held that here rival septs or chieftains had waged fearful battle over their dividing lines. A fair heritage it was, well worthy warrior's sword.</p> 
               <p>The ancient lore of his country was one of Arthur's hobbies, a taste first stimulated to activity by Mr. Massarene, and now he stopped to point out to Mr. Fortescue the position which each clan occupied in the fight, and the admirable adaptation of the spot for a fray.</p> 
               <p>At that moment I recollected a message in regard to the fruit and flowers which had been given me by Lady Grace for Walter. It had slipped my mind altogether. I ran back hastily, as they all stood absorbed in Arthur's description, my intention being to deliver the message and return before my absence was noticed.</p> 
               <p>I went the entire length of the principal conservatory, and still did not see Walter.</p> 
               <p>Pushing open the door of a small room at the end, where I knew he used to pot his plants, I entered. There stood the object of my search, his face buried in his hands, which rested on a cross-beam; he was evidently under the influence of some strong excitement, and did not hear my step as I approached.</p> 
               <p>"Walter! Walter!" I cried, "what is the matter?" But he took no notice.</p> 
               <p>"Walter, will you not speak to me? Oh, what <emph>is</emph> the matter; what have I done? Oh, why did you look at me so, Walter?"</p> 
               <p>He turned at my incoherent appeal, as one who makes a strong effort at self-control.</p> 
               <p>"Olive," said he, grasping my hands between his,<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5593-00000072"/> "bear with me a little while. You cannot understand this, Olive; you have not done any wrong, sweet love; but bear with me for old times' sake. I will soon get the mastery of myself."</p> 
               <p>I was about to answer; my heart was filled with pity, my voice shook with emotion, when looking toward the open door I saw Adele gazing intently upon us. I withdrew my hands hastily, ready to cry with vexation. I knew the use she might make of this; but I did not know the cruel extent to which she would carry her revenge upon me.</p> 
               <p>When I returned to where the others were, Arthur was just getting through with his explanations; he had just fought his battle, and dispersed his invisible army. No one had missed me. Why, then, had Adele? Why had she followed me, unless it was to watch my movements?</p> 
               <p>Arthur remarked that I looked flushed.</p> 
               <p>"You and Adele have been stealing a march on us," he said, carelessly; "walking into rosy cheeks and flashing eyes, while we have been boring ourselves over musty antiquities."</p> 
               <p>All that day I could not throw off the depression that beset me. I could not get Walter, his words and looks, from my mind.</p> 
               <p>Towards evening, as we were all assembled in the drawing-room, Lady Grace remarked, "I begin to feel a little anxious about the flowers and fruit. Walter is not apt to be so dilatory."</p> 
               <p>I started with a frightened exclamation that caused all to look at me. At that moment I remembered that I had again failed to deliver the message. In<pb n=""/> the conflict of feeling, all thought of it had vanished from my mind.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Lady Grace," I gasped, "do not blame Walter; it is my fault. I went back-I went back-" and unable longer to control my pent-up feelings, I burst into a passion of tears.</p> 
               <p>"Olive, my child," said Lady Grace, in astonishment, "what does this mean?"</p> 
               <p>Arthur now came forward with a cold, frowning countenance.</p> 
               <p>"There is no occasion for this excess of feeling," he said, severely. "I will attend to the matter myself." And with hasty steps he left the room.</p> 
               <p>I was now sick, indeed. Continued excitement, suppressed emotion, the misunderstanding, which I felt rather than saw, were too much for me. My head reeled, my limbs trembled. Soon as it was possible I retired to my room, and did not leave it for some days. Feverish, unnerved, anxious, I was ill; ill indeed, with a sickness which not all the tender solicitude of Florence nor the matronly prudence of Lady Grace were likely to cure.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5593-00000073"/> 
               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">LOVE.</head> 
               <p>FOR some days after this I kept my room, really ill with the fever and excitement caused by the apparently unimportant occurrence I have related.</p> 
               <p>The trifling omission of forgetting the message intrusted me by Lady Grace had brought upon me exposure, mortification, and utter misapprehension. For a time my spirit quailed before the entanglement of circumstances, which seemed to have woven a net about me.</p> 
               <p>And then Arthur was so harsh. But why did I show such unusual feeling? It certainly might create suspicion. Ah, could he but know all, how simple it would seem!</p> 
               <p>And then I knew what Adele would make of it; I saw it by the malicious triumph in her eye. I knew that by this time Arthur had been told everything, and told with all the art such a skilled deceiver could command. How cruel it seemed! Had I loved Walter, and Walter had said he loved me, then I could boldly avow my sentiments. Why need I be ashamed? As a man, in natural endowments, he was far superior to any around me. This I knew, but it did not help me. I did not love Walter,-I mean in that acceptation which made him dearer to me than any one else on earth. There was a tenderness in my feelings towards him; had<pb n=""/> always been. A deep sense of pity filled me at any slight, at any disappointment put upon his proud spirit, while I sympathized with all his aspirations, his broad, warm-hearted desires. And now had come this added sense of gratitude, this humbling realization of my own obtuseness, that he, through all the apparent insensibility I had manifested, had continued to regard me with such steadfast devotion, and I had not seen it.</p> 
               <p>For, of course, that brief scene in the conservatory, that deep emotion interpreted into broken words, had revealed to me this truth,-Walter loved me. By the light of this revelation I now understood clearly what had hitherto seemed eccentric, harsh, or unkind in his bearing toward me. But I could not return this devotion; therefore, I must guard his secret as a sacred trust; no, not even Florence should know it.</p> 
               <p>And then, in my musing, I would still repeat that Arthur need not have been so harsh; and he might, in these days of my absence, have easily sent some kind, inquiring message by Florence. The warm-hearted girl would have given it to me with so much pleasure. But, from all I could gather, he had not even mentioned my name. Oh, I knew it all: he now despised me; he turned loathingly from my seeming mean duplicity.</p> 
               <p>But why could he not seek an explanation? I would with one I loved; I would not condemn unheard. But explanations between us would be dangerous; I dared not allow myself to think of them; it was better even though my heart should break,-better that he should despise and avoid me,-oh, much better!</p> 
               <p>Ought I, could I, in honor, listen to the words explanations<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5593-00000074"/> planations might bring? My mind was awakening to this; bitterly was I realizing the anomaly of my position. Could I accept, even if offered, the affections of this cherished son of my generous benefactors? No, no, I could not be so unjust, so cruel, as to bring on them the sneers and the pity of their world; dash all their hopes to the ground, wound them in their tenderest sensibilities. No, no, rather let that vain, heartless girl have her triumph. I would bear myself with apparent insensibility, even though every heart-throe threatened to snap my thread of life asunder.</p> 
               <p>It was well Lady Betty came in. She had heard I was sick. "I will not have this moping!" were her first words; "come down with me to the drawing-room." I expostulated; but it was vain to expostulate with Lady Betty when she decreed a thing. "Come, smooth your black hair and put this yellow rose in it. Why, girl, do you know you are getting to be quite a beauty!" This was a great deal from the dear old lady, who was much more apt to see flaws than perfections, even in those she most admired.</p> 
               <p>I followed her down-stairs. In the drawing-room was a stranger, one of those arrivals of now almost daily occurrence, a British officer, who, with his regiment, was just from London. They had marched to their station in the barracks of the old castle, or fortress, at Arklow, and he had at once ridden over to call on his relatives. Florence introduced him to us as Captain Fortescue, Adele's eldest brother.</p> 
               <p>Arthur was also in the room, but his only recognition was a distant, formal bow. I felt a little sore at this. I had been sick; I was even now very weak; he<pb n=""/> might at any rate have found me a seat. But Captain Fortescue was all gallantry; and, during the short time we remained, he was most assiduous in his attentions.</p> 
               <p>Of course, Lady Betty, during this interview, held as usual her scornful, supercilious air. She looked upon these red-coats, as she called them, with utter detestation. "They are our licensed butchers," she would say to her nephew, "come to try their knives on our poor countrymen. How can you entertain-how can you <emph>endure</emph> them?" she would add, with increased asperity.</p> 
               <p>Poor Sir Robert could only reply with a kind of stifled groan. He could have told her much, have explained a great deal, but silence was his only safety with his hot-headed aunt.</p> 
               <p>She would only remain a few minutes this morning. While Captain Fortescue, Florence, and myself were engaged in one of those desultory chats made up of nothings, she and Arthur had withdrawn to a far corner of the room, and seemed to have some high words together.</p> 
               <p>"Come, Olive, my dear," the old lady said, brusquely, sweeping across the room in her rustling silks, "you're to drive out with me to-day, you know, and I've no further business here."</p> 
               <p>There was no resisting this imperative invitation, and so, escorted by the gallant captain, I was soon seated beside Lady Betty in the old coach.</p> 
               <p>"I've no patience with Arthur!" exclaimed my companion, as the coach-door closed and the captain bowed adieu. "No patience; he's lost all his spirit." She was silent a few minutes, but soon recovered her<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5593-00000075"/> animation. "And now, my dear," she said, as we drove along, "I want you to be well. There is to be a great dinner-party at the Hall, and you must be there. The guests will not be numerous, but will consist of the highest political magnates. My Lord Castlereagh, of course, will be present, and our lord lieutenant, with others; it is in honor of some minister fresh from the British court, some one high in favor with his most sacred and also most imbecile majesty. Faugh! But my reason for being there will be to meet that noble vindicator of our poor, hunted countrymen in these wretched 'State trials,' Mr. Curran,-you have heard of him, my dear?-than whom no nobler soul liveth," added the old lady in her energetic enthusiasm.</p> 
               <p>Yes, I had heard of him; Walter had told me all about him,-how he had risen trumpet-tongued to defend those whom no one else would dare raise a voice to shield. And Walter had read to me some of those glowing speeches, those heart-thrilling appeals, till my eyes would overflow with tears and his voice would be choked with emotion.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes, Lady Betty, I have heard of him,-heard of him so much! I love him with the warmest gratitude. Is he indeed to be there?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; and would you believe my Lady Grace is opposed to it? 'He is so uncouth,' she says, 'and is not one of our set, and you know my Lord Castlereagh and he are always antagonistic, and dear Lady Emily cannot endure him. How could you, Sir Robert, be so imprudent as to invite him at this time? Is there no way you can get out of it,-send an apology, appoint some other time,-anything?' And I do believe the<pb n=""/> poor, wavering fellow would have had to submit had I not been there! Bless me! I sometimes think he is not sure his soul's his own."</p> 
               <p>Poor, dear Lady Betty, she was ever at war. It would seem as if to her the world was one vast arena of pointed weapons, with which she must do battle. But I loved her; warm-hearted, impulsive, her sympathies were ever with the oppressed. She hated all pretension. Management, long-waiting, persuasion, were her abhorrence. She had no patience with those who, loving peace, would seek to bring about their objects by such means, neither had she patience with those who, even for the ambitious and self-seeking, might find a word of apology. In her strong one-sidedness, she did not always judge aright; seeing but in part, she would condemn, when in her moments of calmer retrospection she could not but admit she had been wrong. But I loved her; I knew the strong pulses of her heart beat for the right, and I rejoiced in their strength.</p> 
               <p>When we, or rather I, returned to the Hall,-for Lady Betty left me at the gate,-I found Florence alone. The other ladies, with Arthur, were out for a drive before luncheon, and the gallant captain was gone.</p> 
               <p>Florence was in high glee; I had made a decided conquest, she said. This was a delightful case of love at first sight. Oh, the captain had asked so many questions about me! If Ireland produced such forms and faces, he was a most lucky fellow to have been sent here.</p> 
               <p>"But do you know, Olive," she said, laughing, "that cool-headed Arthur had the heart to interrupt his rhapsodies, by quietly remarking you were father's<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC5593-00000076"/> ward. And then I said, I fear a little maliciously, that I doubted if he would find favor in your eyes so long as he wore that uniform, for you were a staunch Irish girl. But the captain didn't mind our raillery; he laughed, and said he would hope to blind your eyes to that, for there was such a thing as being color-blind as well as love-blind, and in the red you might come to see only the green. But Olive," she said, suddenly changing her tone, "what ails Arthur? He quite reproved me for my levity. I do not think there was anything wrong in what I said, do you?"</p> 
               <p>"No, dear, Captain Fortescue would understand it was all in jest."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly he would." And after a pause, her sweet face brightening, she added, "I have it all now; it is because it was Adele's brother, he is afraid of having anything done to give offense. You would be astonished to see how intimate they have become, all within a few days; there is so much whispering and talk between them. If Major Trenchard were to come now, I could have him all to myself. But you have heard, Olive, he is appointed aid to Lieutenant-General Lake, commander-in-chief of all his majesty's forces in Ireland, and they have been off, scouring the country. He has not been here in some days, but I have just had a note from him, saying he will be back to-morrow or next day; at any rate, he and the general will be here at papa's dinner-party. You have heard of that, dear, have you not?" I told her I had.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A FEW IRISH CELEBRITIES.</head> 
               <p>THE evening of our small, but brilliant dinner-party had come. I was to have the pleasure I had so desired of seeing Mr. Curran face to face. Curran, whose name Walter and I had so often pronounced with enthusiasm! Curran, the daring defender of the unfortunate State prisoners! Curran, who never drew back from danger in his country's cause, and whose burning denunciations against the wrongs inflicted upon his countrymen had, for a moment, arrested the attention of the corrupt, and stayed the uplifted arm of cruelty for a brief, astonished pause! I was to see this man; I was to hear his voice, be near him a whole evening. The thought filled me with excitement and a fluttering expectation.</p> 
               <p>But why had Sir Robert so determinedly invited him at this time? He must have known that most of the distinguished guests invited were the strong political opponents of Curran,-that even more than political animosity existed between them-that there was strong personal dislike also. Lord Castlereagh, of course, would be there, and all knew the bitter animosity between them; also his excellency the lord lieutenant, and the many military officers, with their chief. Of course, with none of these could there be any sympathy with this advocate of the people, and yet Sir<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC5593-00000077"/> Robert had invited him. It was quite a mystery to me. Could it be that he wanted it seen and felt that he was not wholly with the governing party? It might be so; I could not think of any other solution.</p> 
               <p>The dining-hall shone brilliantly on this evening, as the guests paired in in their proper order. Lady Grace, with the honorable Mr. Pelham. Then his excellency Lord Cambden and lady, followed by General Lake, commander-in-chief, who had taken under his escort the fair daughter of the house. Then, following Lord Castlereagh and the Lady Emily, came a few honorables and right honorables of both sexes, with young officers in their scarlet uniforms, and bright maidens in all the flutter of gauze and gossamer, while the rear was brought up by the venerable Lady Betty with Mr. Curran and Sir Robert on either side. Adele had secured Arthur, and Captain Fortescue, her brother, claimed me as his partner.</p> 
               <p>I would much rather have had it otherwise. I should have liked to sit apart unnoticed,-to watch the gay scene, the varying countenances; to listen to the wit, the repartee, the graceful words and polished phrases, coined, I was sometimes disposed to think, rather to conceal, than to express, thought.</p> 
               <p>And truly it was a brilliant scene. At either end of the long hall huge fires blazed in the ample grates, diffusing a cheerful glow and warmth; over the long table, glittering with silver and cut glass, hung the immense chandelier, with its numerous wax-lights, and along the walls the oval mirrors, with their branch candlesticks, reflected and repeated the brightness. On the spacious sideboard, fruits and flowers, heaped in<pb n=""/> splendid profusion, diffused a delightful fragrance over the room.</p> 
               <p>I think all felt the charm of the occasion, for the steps of the guests grew lighter and their smiles gayer, as they entered the cheerful hall.</p> 
               <p>"I think I never saw a beautifuller set of people," whispered Jenks to his powdered assistant, in my hearing; "and how grand the young master looks!"</p> 
               <p>I was well pleased with the place assigned me, though I would have preferred not to have had Adele and Arthur immediately opposite. I could have a good view of the faces I most wished to see. Mr. Curran and Lady Betty were next below Adele and Arthur, nearer Sir Robert, who seemed determined to pay the gentleman all honor.</p> 
               <p>Conversation, during the different courses, was quite animated; there were no dull pauses of comparative silence, but it was at first confined mostly to those in close proximity; as the dessert was removed and the fruit and wine were circulating it became more general.</p> 
               <p>There was great praise bestowed on the fruit and flowers, so abundant at this late season.</p> 
               <p>You must have a jewel of a gardener," said one of the right honorables to the host.</p> 
               <p>Truly, he is a jewel," answered Sir Robert, with warmth; "a splendid fellow, a true, natural genius."</p> 
               <p>"And who is this splendid fellow?" asked Captain Fortescue, speaking to Arthur across the table.</p> 
               <p>"Well, ah!"-altogether taken by surprise, Arthur began, "He is, he is-"</p> 
               <p>When Adele, taking the words from him, said, "He is a young rustic,-a proteg of the family in whom<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5593-00000078"/> Sir Robert takes some interest." This was said with a loud voice, that all could hear. And then Arthur, as if ashamed of his wavering, added, "He is, as my father has said, a truly noble fellow, and one whose capacity we might all envy."</p> 
               <p>As he said this he fixed his eyes on me, and I felt the blood mount to my cheeks, and fancied I saw that half-sneering smile on Adele's face which always provoked me. I was most painfully agitated. I had listened with pleasure to Walter's praises; but now, because Arthur looked at me, because I supposed I knew what was in his mind, I must connect it with myself, and act in this ridiculous way. How provoking! I did not know whether to be most angry with Arthur or myself. Did he suppose he was grandly magnanimous, when he thus patronizingly echoed the praises of one who could be great without them? But I was too angry to be just or generous; I felt this, and it made me still more vexed.</p> 
               <p>Fortunately, Captain Fortescue had not noticed my embarrassment, and continued talking, much to my relief, for the effort to catch his words, and answer as I should, diverted my thoughts from myself.</p> 
               <p>Politics had been avoided, no doubt purposely, during our meal; this rather threw a restraint on conversation. It was felt there were contending elements near, and subjects of discord were prudently avoided; there had been many other topics touched upon, but politics being the real interest of the day, every one's mind being full of them, made all efforts on other subjects grow inevitably tame and uninteresting.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Pelham, the honored guest of the occasion, was<pb n=""/> not much of a talker; he confined himself mostly to questions and monosyllables. He had been picking his filberts and sipping his wine with quite an occupied air, when he suddenly looked up, and, addressing the gentleman seated opposite to him, Lieutenant-General Lake, said, "I hear, General, that you and one of your aids have been scouring the country."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, we have had a very pleasant run," was the answer; "haven't we, Trenchard?" turning to the major, who was near.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes, very," answered the major, so much occupied at this moment with Florence, he hardly knew the question asked.</p> 
               <p>"And what did you see?" was the gentleman's next inquiry.</p> 
               <p>"Well, not much," was the rather tardy reply; "everything appeared quiet." The general was evidently annoyed at these repeated questions.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, just like them!" were Mr. Pelham's half-sneering words; "just like them! the rebel dogs, skulking in their holes and coverts, ready to give the back-handed blow when they dare. No,"-and now he spoke with a force in strong contrast with his former drawling, half-sleepy words,-"no, by everything I love, I never yet knew an Irishman who could face a manly foe!"</p> 
               <p>Here was a firebrand thrown in our midst; I was in a perfect flame of indignation. I looked at Florence; her eyes glittered with suppressed emotion, and Lady Betty, with a low growl, was striving to keep her words down. Sir Robert looked dark as night. This was a wanton insult; but as host, and in consideration of his other guests, he refrained from answering.</p> 
               <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5593-00000079"/> 
               <p>I dared not look at Arthur. How could he keep so quiet? How could he refrain from striking this insolent man to the earth? But he was at his father's table, and if Sir Robert did not choose to resent, it was unbecoming his son to do so, and Adele was making every effort to distract his attention.</p> 
               <p>There was quite an embarrassing pause after Mr. Pelham had ceased speaking. Mr. Curran had not yet made any sign. Indeed, I will confess, after all I had heard, I was much disappointed in him. Plain of feature, and small in stature, there were apparently few of the marks of that giant intellect I had heard so much about. He looked dull and dispirited all through the dinner-hour, saying little, and scarcely answering Lady Betty, who sat next him, when she spoke. But I heard afterwards that he was unusually exhausted on that particular evening, having been in court all day, pleading with all his energies, as only he could plead, for the life of one whom his eloquence had failed to save.</p> 
               <p>But now a change came. The fire of life was in his eye and every motion. His breast heaved, the great head, before drooping, now towered upward, and the whole person assumed, to my eyes, larger proportions, as he said in a low, but distinct voice, heard by every one present, "If these, Mr. Pelham, are the views of your countrymen, of my countrymen, and of the court you have so lately left, we need not wonder at much we see around us; but," he continued, in the same tone, "may I ask the honorable gentleman how many Irishmen he has the honor of knowing?"</p> 
               <p>"Not many, thank Heaven!" was the rude reply.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>I was so provoked now I could not help speaking to my neighbor in indignation.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, this is nothing," he said, with a smile.</p> 
               <p>"It is something," I answered, "when you hear such sentiments, or their equivalent, echoed by strangers who know so little of us, judging alone by their prejudices, and then assuming a superiority which gives them the right to condemn; it is contemptible, it is unjust," I repeated, scarcely able to restrain the tears of vexation that would come unbidden.</p> 
               <p>"But you must not include me," whispered my companion, "in these angry denunciations. I have learned to appreciate and admire much, very much, in your country." This he said with a softened voice, which made me momentarily ashamed of my absurd impetuosity.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Curran was, however, still pursuing his questionings. "And may I ask, Mr. Pelham, if not from personal knowledge, from what other source did you derive this information as to our national characteristics?"</p> 
               <p>The gentleman looked much puzzled. Mr. Curran was so calm, and yet spoke with such an intensity of purpose, there could be no evasion; he must answer. He said, with as much calmness as he could assume, "Oh, I have read much, and heard a great deal more."</p> 
               <p>"But was this reading and hearing from interested or disinterested parties, may I again ask?"</p> 
               <p>"Zounds, sir!-beg pardon, ladies,"-looking along the table, "but I would have this gentleman know I am not in a court of justice under cross-examination!"</p> 
               <p>"No, sir," was the answer, with heightened voice and increased severity. "No, sir; but you have made<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5593-00000080"/> a public accusation reflecting on the honor and manliness of my countrymen, and you are bound either to substantiate or withdraw it."</p> 
               <p>The matter began to look serious and smell somewhat of powder. There were oh's and ah's and smothered exclamations of excitement.</p> 
               <p>I fear the sympathies of most were with the stranger. There is so much of toadyism about. He was the lion of the feast, though not a very agreeable one, it must be confessed; but then he was a celebrated person, known to hold confidential relations with that weak, half-imbecile old monarch, George the Third, who hated as much as he dreaded his Irish subjects. This position, of course, gave him great importance; the odor of royalty still lingered round him, and he might be forgiven some presumption under such circumstances.</p> 
               <p>Lord Castlereagh was about to speak, when his wife, the Lady Emily, always timid and frail, laid her hand entreatingly on his arm; "Do not, my lord, do not interfere in this foolish quarrel!" But his lordship persisted, saying that, as a native Irishman, he might be allowed to speak, and might be supposed to hold the honor of his country as dear as any; and he had listened to the remarks of his right honorable friend, but had not attached any importance to them, considering them simply as mere passing words.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, my lord!" was the answering response of bitter irony, "you have chosen the better way,-you pour the oil of peace on the festering sore, while I irritate it to keener anguish; but, my lord, you may not know, as the ear can be attuned to acute sensibility, so that a false note, be it ever so indistinct, will thrill<pb n=""/> its every nerve with pain, so the emotions, in their severe training, may become so acutely susceptible that even the very atmosphere they breathe, full of discordant elements, will rouse them to a maddening frenzy; but, my lord, I may remember your lordship has never been put through such hard schooling, therefore it cannot be supposed you will understand these things as readily as those who have."</p> 
               <p>There was now a most uncomfortable silence, only interrupted by an occasional drumming of Lady Betty's fingers on the table, who seemingly must do something to allay her excitement. Lady Grace had been throwing indignant glances at her much-abhorred guest, and, indeed, many others had followed her example. They did not stop to consider the merits of the case; they only felt they were disturbed, that their hostess was annoyed, and so they looked on with contempt; but Mr. Curran did not heed all this. Was he thinking of that day's work of his, when, with heart and soul and every energy he possessed, he had been striving to save the life of a fellow-being, an honorable, just, high-minded man, but without avail? He must suffer, condemned by laws both cruel and unjust,-laws made for the occasion, and pushed through by some among these courteous, elegant gentlemen, among whom the one to whom he had been last speaking was one of the chief. Was it all this that had so embittered his thoughts? Was he going through that hard schooling of which he had been speaking, which made the very air he was breathing with them a furnace which was heating his blood to a maddening fury?</p> 
               <p>Ah, how I wished I was like the young people I saw<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5593-00000081"/> there! How many of them knew little and cared less about all that was going on about them! I almost envied their indifference. How lightly and airily and unbiased they could enjoy, could wonder, and raise their eyebrows in pretty alarm!-"A slight unpleasantness, easy to forgive." "Dear Lady Grace, never mind, <emph>we</emph> do not care for this little discourtesy." But withal, every one felt uncomfortable.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Pelham, however, by this time seemed to become aware how discourteously he had acted, considering by whom he was entertained, and, bowing to Sir Robert, hoped he would be pardoned for anything unseemly he might have uttered. "But the fact is, Sir Robert," he added, with still culpable thoughtlessness, "when I say Irishmen, I do not include any I should expect to meet at your table; it is but the rabble I mean."</p> 
               <p>This rather dubious apology was not at all calculated to allay unpleasant feelings. Sir Robert still frowned darkly, even while bowing acceptance of what was said, and Lady Betty drummed more loudly than ever on the table as she fidgeted uneasily in her chair, while Mr. Curran sprang to his feet as if unable to control his passion, his face burning as a flame of concentrated indignation, while he said, with that terrible force of his, "And is this, sir, your explanation of the insulting words used to our host and to his countrymen present?"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Pelham's countenance fell, and he fairly quailed under the searching glance of that eye that seemed to penetrate his very soul, as he answered, with an assumption of coolness, "Well-yes-not exactly-no insult was intended."</p> 
               <p>"Well, then," was the deliberate reply, "I understand<pb n=""/> stand your meaning is precisely what mine would be should I say, 'I never saw an Englishman who was not bombastic, filled with his own importance, a petty tyrant, an oppressor, a greedy gatherer of other men's gains,' and should shelter myself by declaring 'it is only the rabble I call Englishmen!'" This was said with a withering sneer, a scorn, a glance of the eye that seemed to flame down upon his victim like a devouring fire. "Am I right?" he added.</p> 
               <p>For an instant there was a perfect hush, then Lady Grace arose, her eye glanced lightning at her husband, and her voice was clear and sharp, as she said, "Ladies, we will retire to the drawing-room. Gentlemen, it is my desire that you follow us immediately-you, also, Arthur," glancing at her son. The dignity and self-command of the hostess seemed to recall all present to their senses. All rose from their seats, and in a few moments the room was cleared, only Sir Robert, Mr. Curran, and myself remaining. Lady Betty, I know not why, followed with the crowd. I had begged Captain Fortescue to leave me. As I looked at Mr. Curran his head was drooping on his breast. He was indeed like a flame fairly burned out. "Can you forgive me?" he said to Sir Robert, raising himself wearily up; "I have forgotten myself, insulted your guests-fool that I was, to come with this inflammable temper of mine, where I knew I should meet those with whom my whole life is at war. Can you forgive me? to you I owe every apology."</p> 
               <p>"Forgive you!" said Sir Robert, warmly grasping the hand held out to him, "forgive you! Why, Curran, all that I feel is honor for you, and shame for myself,<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5593-00000082"/> that I can sit by without finding a word to resent these damnable affronts."</p> 
               <p>"But you are held by motives," was the kind and soothing answer, "that I know nothing about."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, the trammels by which all weak minds are held, the dread of consequences," was the half-angry, despairing reply.</p> 
               <p>"Not so, my friend, not altogether so. A nicely-balanced conscience that weighs its duty everywhere, may force us to sacrifice the strongest desires of our heart. You have the interests of a wife and children to remember, the honor of an ancient name to transmit. I know your difficulties; forgive the part I have played to give you trouble; I will never so err again, believe me;" and with another warm pressure of the hand he was gone.</p>

               <p>SIR ROBERT sat for some time in moody silence, with occasionally a sigh that seemed absolutely bursting from his breast. At last he looked up, and started when he saw my pitying eyes fixed on him. I feared he might be angry to find me watching when he supposed he was alone, but instead of that he looked into my face with kindly affection, as he said, "Yes, Olive, you know how it feels. It is hard, but we must go on playing<pb n=""/> our part. Now, my girl, to the drawing-room. I will remain behind a few minutes longer."</p> 
               <p>When I reached that apartment I found evident consternation on every face. The ladies and gentlemen were ranged on either side the long room, leaving a wide space, which Lady Betty was traversing with slow, measured steps. She did, indeed, look formidable. I had never before seen her with such an air of majesty. Her black-velvet robe swept the floor, while the band of brilliants on the aged head trembled with every violent pulsation of her heart. Many eyes looked on her with timid terror; it might be her reason was really dethroned by excitement. Her actions were denunciatory, but she seemed unable by words to express those feelings. As she came near, I caught the low murmur, "And has it come to this?" As I looked, she tottered,-she was ghastly white,-while a strange expression at the moment passed over her face.</p> 
               <p>Regardless of all eyes, thinking only of my kind old friend, I ran to her, dear Lady Betty! I put my arm around her waist. I was tall and strong and could support her. Many now rose in alarm to assist, but she motioned them away in such an imperious style that none dare follow, as I drew her towards a small ante-room, where, placing her on the sofa, I closed the door by her command.</p> 
               <p>As I turned to her, she was still helpless and pale. I raised the pillow from the sofa, and, placing it on the arm, laid the aged head gently upon it. My whole heart went out to her in pity. What could I do for her. So solitary had been her life, so peculiar in its antagonism, there were none to love, none to come near her<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC5593-00000083"/> in tender solicitude in this her old age. I could not blame any; she had been a strange mystery, an enigma, to most.</p> 
               <p>But I loved her; I thought I understood her, dear old lady! My tears fell fast as I kissed the rigid lips, and chafed the cold thin hands. She seemed to sleep at last, and her respiration became more soft, her face lost its rigidity, an unusually gentle look suffused her features, and she lay like a child who, in the intensity of its emotions, had sobbed itself to rest.</p> 
               <p>Yes, with my full heart I pitied her, as I sat there in silence watching what almost seemed to me her flitting breath. So few understood her; so broad had been her ambition, so unproductive her life. Of the riches of human love she possessed a large share, but so eccentric had been its course among the ruins and outposts of humanity, so little had been available for the social and ordinary amenities of life, that many supposed she neither knew nor cared for friendship; but I knew she did. Her ambition had not been for self, or individual aggrandizement; it had been for her people, her race. Neither had it been that they might become a powerful nation, ready to hurl defiance, and absorb other nations as they had been absorbed; but that they might be individually elevated, be all they might be. She knew well they possessed the qualities which, under a right state of things, would make them the equal of any; this was what she desired, only that they might be truly themselves.</p> 
               <p>Poor old lady! Her one idea became a ruling passion, too often unmanageable. With her uncontrolled energies, her aptness for hasty conclusions, her imperative<pb n=""/> perative temper, her best-intentioned efforts often fell powerless, and she was disappointed and embittered; blaming others, when the fault was chiefly her own. She had gone by the straight way, the right way, the honest way; why should she fail? And why should others think to succeed by devious ways, by windings and turnings and subtle diplomacy? Hers was eminently a direct nature, and she could not conceive that others, without the basest of motives, should seek to attain their ends by another policy. So she had little patience with Sir Robert, or with those who bore the evils inflicted upon their country quietly, hoping for better things.</p> 
               <p>Presently she opened her eyes, and looked at me with a sort of surprise; then, seeming to recollect herself, she said, "Ah, Olive; it is you, child! Yes; now I remember. I will go, my dear, this moment. I must go home." And then she attempted to rise, but her head fell feebly back.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Lady Betty, do not; you are not able!" I answered, in alarm. But I forgot the old nature, that only gained strength by opposition.</p> 
               <p>"But I must, I will go home! Olive, say not another word." And now she raised her head and straightened herself on the sofa.</p> 
               <p>"Go now, child, and call Millicent,"-Millicent was her ancient maid who had waited on her from a girl,-"and mind you are to go down the back stairs; and tell her to make no fuss, but have Hodge here with the carriage, at the private door, in ten minutes; she can bring my wraps with her."</p> 
               <p>I knew there was no use in my wasting any more<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC5593-00000084"/> entreaties, and so I at once attended to her commands. She would hardly allow me to assist her, when all was ready, down the few steps, but she kissed me affectionately when I wrapped the shawls around her in the carriage. "Come to me to-morrow, dear," she said.</p> 
               <p>I felt a painful sense of sadness as I said good-by. I should have liked to have accompanied her home, but I knew it would not do to make such an offer; it would have given offense to have implied any sense of weakness.</p> 
               <p>I now went to my own room. I could not bear to go back among those who would be making comments, and might ask unpleasant questions; and so, taking a book, I waited for Florence to come when all were gone.</p> 
               <p>In the morning, however, I was early at the lonely mansion of Lady Betty. The morning was cloudy, with a heavy sea-mist, and the old place, with its surroundings, looked drearier than ever. The large gate in the high wall was open. That seemed strange, it was always so scrupulously closed after the ingress or egress of any visitor, and it was so early; and the main entrance door of the house too was open, but I did not see any one. I hurried through the hall, and up the wide, dark stairway, to Lady Betty's room, and there I saw it all-the old lady was seriously ill. Two physicians were present,-her own and a stranger. She lay prostrate. Still, when I spoke to her, she knew me; at least smiled when I kissed her hand and her forehead. How white she looked; how strangely near to death! She had been attacked again in the night. Medical aid was at once summoned; she was pronounced<pb n=""/> nounced to be laboring under a severe stroke of paralysis.</p> 
               <p>Gradually, however, the dangerous symptoms abated, and she recovered; but not as Lady Betty again. Dear old lady; the turmoil of life with her now was past! The quick pulsations of all those restless nerves were stilled forever. All that had been was henceforth to be to her as a dream; and a pleasant dream it must have been, for she often smiled, and always looked serene and calm.</p> 
               <p>But how sad to us who looked on! It seemed as though I could sob my heart away, as I looked at her, day after day, in that helpless, half-childish contentment. Had she been less strong, more yielding, more of a dependent nature through her life, I could have borne it better. But to see her thus, to miss the sharp, decisive tones, the spirited readiness for combat, was pathetic and pitiful beyond words, and beyond words I sorrowed over and sympathized with Lady Betty.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">FESTIVE PREPARATIONS.</head> 
               <p>FOR two weeks after the sudden illness of Lady Betty, I saw little of the inmates of the Hall. I remained at the bedside of the invalid, doing what little was in my power to soothe and ease her. There were messages to and fro, and visits of condolence from Sir Robert and Lady Grace, Arthur and Adele, but it was, I confess, a relief to me, for a time, to remain apart from my friends. But at length, when the old lady had recovered sufficiently to sit up, attended by her old servitors, there was no longer any necessity for my presence; and when Florence rode over one morning, asking playfully, but sadly, if I had utterly forsaken her, I no longer delayed my return to the Hall. Great festivities were shortly to take place there, to celebrate Arthur's attainment of his majority. A dinner was to be given to the tenantry; a grand ball was to signalize the evening, on which occasion, also, Florence was to make her first entrance into the great, fashionable world. It saddened me to leave my dear old friend, so strangely stricken, so sadly changed. On my knees beside her, as I held her hand to my heart, I tried to recall her recollection of me. But no; I was to her as though I had never been. She stroked my head, and played with my long locks; but she called me<pb n=""/> Mytha,-a name, doubtless, of some dear one long passed away.</p> 
               <p>On my return home, I found everything in the bustle of preparation for the great event; every one busy,-servants, housekeeper, upholsterers, decorators,-and all under the superintendence of Adele; even Lady Grace was waiting her advice.</p> 
               <p>"And," whispered Florence, as she drew me away to our own room, "we may as well stay here; we are not needed. In fact, we are entirely superseded, and may as well make the best of it. I shall not fret; mamma thinks nobody can do anything right but Adele, and Adele is fully persuaded of that fact herself. And to do her justice, Olive, she is wonderful; she thinks of everything, and never tires. Dear mamma has such boundless faith in her that any little interference I have attempted has only made trouble, so I intend gracefully to retire; and you and I will have quite enough to do to fit ourselves out. Papa has given me <foreign xml:lang="FRA">carte-blanche</foreign> as to dresses, so we must find our modiste at once, to make us presentable for the grand occasion."</p> 
               <p>"Make <emph>us!</emph>" I repeated, "Why surely, Florence, you do not think of anything so preposterous as presenting Olive Lacey to the world as one on the same footing with yourself?"</p> 
               <p>"And why not?" said the generous girl. "Nature has settled that; you <emph>are</emph> fitted for any station. Yes, Olive, you would stand as a queen among hundreds. Has not the brilliant Captain Fortescue, spite of his sister, discovered and proclaimed that fact?" she added, mischievously. "But, Olive, my friend," she said, thoughtfully, her smile vanishing, and her voice taking<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5593-00000086"/> that low, sweet tone which was its peculiar charm, "there is no jest about this. You are my adopted sister, the one who has, as papa says, sustained me in life, strength, and happiness. You must still be my sister, whatever may come, and you will not, and cannot, thwart me in this. If you do," she added, impetuously, "I will throw this thing up, and have nothing to do with it."</p> 
               <p>It is unnecessary to say that I yielded to Florence's wishes. Perhaps I hung back a little, dissuaded her a little, and flattered myself that I displayed a little philosophy in so doing. But what girl of eighteen can withstand the <choice>
                     <sic>eclt</sic>
                     <corr>clat</corr>
                  </choice> of dress and admiration, and all the thousand expectations and brilliant promises of a first entre into society?</p> 
               <p>I was soon as deep in all the mysteries of fashion as Florence could desire.</p> 
               <p>It seemed that this matter of my presentation had been fully discussed in family conclave. Lady Grace had opposed it, but Florence and Sir Robert had been persistent. Sir Robert's obstinacy had no doubt been intensified by some thoughtless remark of Adele, that such a thing would not be allowed in good society in England. Sir Robert hated such allusions.</p> 
               <p>"Confound her impudence!" was his after-comment to his wife, "I will teach her that in Ireland such upstart impertinence will not be tolerated. She is neither in mind nor person to be compared with Olive. English good society forsooth!"</p> 
               <p>But Lady Grace soon quieted her irate lord, excusing and palliating Adele's offense as attributable solely to thoughtlessness and youthful high spirits.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>During this week of preparation we seldom left our own cozy little sitting-room; our dresses were being made in the city, but we had a great deal else to do, and were fully occupied. Occasionally in the morning a few callers would drop in, our apartment being about only one in the house not subject to the invasion of upholsterers. Sometimes Captain Fortescue came with Major Trenchard to spend an hour or so, or we were enlivened by a call from our new neighbors, the Misses Neville, accompanied by their shadow, the younger Mr. Fortescue. The Fortescue and Neville families had been quite intimate in London, but Adele now saw fit to "snub" them, as she did her young brother, without mercy; so they betook themselves to Florence and myself for entertainment, invading our little boudoir of a morning in a flutter of excitement about the ball-what they should wear, and what they should do.</p> 
               <p>These young ladies were about the average young ladies to be met with every day,-occupied with themselves, full of the present with its enjoyments, and troubling themselves little about the future, whether for good or ill,-which was judicious, perhaps, for with their small amount of native character it would be made or marred by the circumstances surrounding them.</p> 
               <p>Now they chose to adopt the rle of the martyr. "Papa <emph>would</emph> have them remain in this horrid Ireland; it was always wet and always muddy, and they were always drabbled and not fit to be seen!" they exclaimed, as they bustled into our sweet little gem of a room, where Florence and I were plying our needles in quiet comfort.</p> 
               <p>Florence always received them good-humoredly; had<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC5593-00000087"/> she respected them more, perhaps she would have resented their unconscious rudeness; as it was, she found their childish chat amusing.</p> 
               <p>"And why did you not have your carriage? even though the distance is short, it is not worth while to expose one's self to such inconvenience," she said; "I shall be most happy to send you home in my pony-phaeton."</p> 
               <p>No, they would not allow that; they would be distressed, they would have colds, even if it were for nothing but to spite papa; he was so mean and churlish about the carriage!</p> 
               <p>This species of martyrdom is rather enjoyable, be it known, to those who suffer it, and to deprive them of their laurels would be a thankless task.</p> 
               <p>"But," said Florence, "I have heard that your English winters are even more wet than ours, and that your London fogs exceed anything we can get up."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, dear!" said Miss Charlotte, "I suppose Major Trenchard has told you this. Everything in Ireland looks bright to him now, I suppose."</p> 
               <p>Florence blushed, but she appealed to the silent Mr. Fortescue to say if it were not so.</p> 
               <p>That young gentleman was considerably startled by the appeal. He was accustomed to listen complacently to the rattling remarks of his lady friends, but as to drawing any conclusions from what they said, that was entirely out of his range.</p> 
               <p>"Well-ah-I declare!" he said, with his accomplished drawl, "I-ah-really hardly heard what was said; but, ah-" and here he looked uneasily out of the window, but the prospect could hardly assist his<pb n=""/> decision, for there was a fine misty rain falling-"it's deuced hard to say," he added desperately, "but I am disposed to think both young ladies may be right."</p> 
               <p>This sententious conclusion, being an uncommonly exhausting effort for the young gentleman, was accepted as satisfactory all around. The young visitors proceeded without delay to set forth the special object of their call this morning.</p> 
               <p>"Mamma wished to know if we could be supplied with flowers on the night of the ball. We hear that your gardener has such abundance of rare ones. Papa will not allow us new dresses, he is so stingy. He says we had so many in England-"</p> 
               <p>"And such lovely ones they were, too!" chimed in the sister.</p> 
               <p>"That it has broke him, and he says there is no squeezing any more money out of these 'cursed' Irish estates." I thought of the ruin of my poor father, and my heart rose with indignation.</p> 
               <p>"Gentlemen will speak out, you know," added the speaker, archly. "Everything is going to ruin by the improvidence of these miserable, lazy people-but excuse me, Miss Greyton, I forgot; you see we have to suffer for all this."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I will excuse you," replied Florence, with much dignity, "because you do not know of what you are talking; but remember, I am an Irish girl, and raised under the same sky and on the same soil with that 'miserable' set, and I can say truly I am proud of it."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, dear!" said the thoughtless girl, momentarily touched, "I am ashamed of myself; do forgive me!"<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5593-00000088"/> And then she rattled on in the same heedless manner, "Mamma says that with some fixing, and plenty of fresh flowers, the dresses will do very well for-for-" She stopped confused.</p> 
               <p>"A ball in Ireland," added Florence, laughing.</p> 
               <p>"Charlotte is <emph>such</emph> a blunderer," said the elder Miss Neville.</p> 
               <p>"Never mind," said Florence, good-humoredly, "you shall have all the flowers you want."</p> 
               <p>On the last day before the entertainment, etiquette being somewhat suspended in the general bustle, I hastened up-stairs immediately after dinner, expecting to be joined by Florence, that we might together put the finishing touches to our toilet preparations. Florence herself had proposed this hasty exit, but she lingered unaccountably below, while I waited impatiently,-now smoothing out nervously a shining ribbon, now trying the effect of a bit of lace. Around me in splendid confusion lay spread our dresses, just sent from Dublin. Of course I was full of excitement with anticipated pleasure; but Florence did not come.</p> 
               <p>At length, however, I heard her step in the corridor, and she entered with a flushed face and eye that indicated something was amiss. I asked no questions. She sat silently awhile looking out of the window; at length she broke forth as if it was impossible to restrain her feelings:</p> 
               <p>"I was <emph>so</emph> angry, I could not help speaking, although mamma was displeased. After you left the room, Olive, Captain Fortescue and the major detained me a moment in the drawing-room; and, as they were rising to go, the captain asked me if you would be<pb n=""/> present at the ball, and continued making some complimentary remarks. I was uneasy, knowing that you were waiting, but the poor fellow was <emph>so</emph> enthusiastic about you, Olive, that I had not the heart to interrupt him. I suppose Adele began to think he was about making proposals for your hand, for she suddenly stopped talking to Major Trenchard, and said, in her confident but airy way, 'Now, captain, you shall not torment Miss Olive; I won't have it; besides-'</p> 
               <p>"'Besides what?' said the captain, turning sharply upon her, in a way that startled me.</p> 
               <p>"'She is engaged to one in her own station in life,' said his sister.</p> 
               <p>"Of course, Olive, I knew that it was not so, and denied it with more vehemence than necessary, I dare say."</p> 
               <p>I had been expecting some such effect of Adele's espionage, so that I was not so much surprised as Florence had been.</p> 
               <p>"To whom does she say I am engaged?" I asked calmly.</p> 
               <p>"To Walter, of course. But how can you take it so quietly, Olive? I feel as if I must go to her and say all that is in my mind. I will not profess friendship for one so false! Oh, if you had heard her, had seen the air with which she said, 'Why is it so impossible-why blame her-is it not natural?' turning and appealing to mamma: 'Should she not be attracted to her kind?'</p> 
               <p>"Olive, I <emph>was</emph> vexed; I almost lost my temper. 'It is not so, she is not engaged to any one,' I cried, 'it is cruelly wrong to say it!'</p> 
               <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5593-00000089"/> 
               <p>"Then Arthur broke in with his sternest voice, and demanded if to my certain knowledge what I asserted was true. I declare I felt as if I were being tried for my life; and so after blundering yes, and no, and being utterly confused, I must finish by bursting into tears. Mamma was angry; every one was angry. She said I was a slave to my attachment to you. I wish papa had been there; he would have taken my part, I know. Indeed, Captain Fortescue was the only one who showed any kindness. Major Trenchard was deeply occupied turning over the leaves of a book-it must have been an interesting volume! I really do believe he is afraid of Adele: he chimes in with all she says, follows her about, and does her bidding as though she was the arbiter of his fate. But, Olive, why don't you speak?"</p> 
               <p>Agitation, and a feeling of disdain for the petty yet inextricable tangle in which I found myself, had kept me silent while Florence poured forth her flood of feeling. <emph>She</emph> was my friend, my sole, true, faithful friend. I looked up to her, with glad and grateful eyes, as I said, "And how did it all end, Florence?"</p> 
               <p>"It ended thus," said Florence, smiling in the midst of her tears. "As I rose in my excitement (with anything but dignity, I assure you) to beat a hasty retreat, Captain Fortescue gave me his hand to lead me to the door, and pressed mine reassuringly, saying he for one appreciated my spirited defense of an absent friend! I somehow imagine that Adele was providentially sent here to teach me and all my friends that I am not an angel."</p> 
               <p>I had the key to all this in my own secret keeping,<pb n=""/> and gladly would I have laid bare every thought to Florence, as she would freely have done to me, but I could not yet. Her simple, direct nature knew no complications, but mine was full of them. I could scarce myself analyze the various emotions that swayed my mind as I thought of Adele's treachery, of Walter's anguish, of Arthur's stern bearing, his haughty manners, which brooked no explanation. Pride at that moment had full sway over me, and not even to my noble, ingenuous Florence could I freely humble myself to tell all. I could only soothe and thank her, and in my heart of hearts love her more dearly than ever.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE YOUNG HEIR.</head> 
               <p>THE auspicious day at length arrived, ushered in by merry peals from the great Hall tower, and an answering chime from the pretty parish church near by, whose rector was a particular friend of the family.</p> 
               <p>The heir of Greyton Hall had now reached full manhood, and was to add another honorable link to the long chain of representatives who had upheld the dignity of the ancient house.</p> 
               <p>In the days gone by such an event would have been hailed by loud rejoicings, universal feasting, frolic, and fun. But now a gloom was over the country, distrust and suspicion were everywhere; even the immediate<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5593-00000090"/> dependents of the household were not free from it,-the very air was filled with rumors and plots; every stranger was looked upon as an enemy, and every native as a bloodthirsty rebel; all the horrors of a dreaded civil war hung as a pall over every thoughtful spirit.</p> 
               <p>The Greyton family, though ever staunch supporters of British rule, had always been regarded as steady friends of the people. Their representatives for many generations had ranked with those of sound, upright principles, and the present Sir Robert was looked upon as a worthy scion of the old stock. He was much loved even by those opposed to his principles, from the generous urbanity of a manner prompted by a natural kindliness of feeling.</p> 
               <p>His tenantry worshiped him; he had always been a just and liberal landlord; few of the farmers and peasants of the neighboring counties could boast of the comfortable circumstances enjoyed by those on his estate. They knew this, and they would have died rather than harm should come to him in any way; but they could not protect him from others. His principles were known. He entertained largely the British legions that were overrunning the country, and it was talked about widely that the young heir had also identified himself with the leading powers, and would soon lead to the altar a proud English girl, who had little love or care for them or their interests.</p> 
               <p>Thus, a gloomy atmosphere made itself perceptible. Of course the family knew nothing of these wild reports and personal misgivings; but they were conscious of the disordered state of the country, and felt that they must be prudent. It would not do to open the park<pb n=""/> gates and let all enter, and the first thought of a general jubilee was abandoned, and only a few of the leading tenantry with their families were invited to the afternoon dinner, which, instead of being given, as contemplated, under gayly-decorated tents, in the open air, was to come off quietly in the servants' hall.</p> 
               <p>Neither was there in the immediate domestic circle a much brighter prospect for enjoyment. Here, too, distrust and doubt had insinuated their presence. It seemed as if, with Adele, had crept into our midst a new and strange element. We had hardly defined it yet. We, who had been so free, frank, and unthinking, were now becoming watchful, cynical, sensitively alive to our own dignity, resentful about trifles.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, dear! what is the matter with me, Olive?" Florence would say; "I hardly know myself. I am half provoked all the time, without knowing what for, and I am so meanly suspicious! oh, I am ashamed. I may be too exacting; do you think so, Olive?"</p> 
               <p>Dear girl, although she hardly knew herself, I could easily perceive the source of this painful disquiet. There was a sense of neglect, so fine and subtle that even her keenest perception could not detect its reality, but it was, nevertheless, most keenly felt. Major Trenchard was still her devoted suitor in form, but not soul; his words were for her, but his eyes and thoughts were on Adele.</p> 
               <p>Adele had so absorbed his services during all these preparations; had made it such a point to need his constant attendance; had been so charming in her delighted expressions of gratitude for his assistance, that, for the moment, his head was turned with vanity.<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC5593-00000091"/> Florence had never flattered him; had never raised him to the third heaven in this delightful contemplation of himself. She had simply loved him. It remained for this lovely and gifted Adele to discover his rare worth! How could he help bearing the charmer in his thoughts?</p> 
               <p>But I, silent and apart, yet deeply interested, sometimes fancied I discovered the motive of all this by-play. Adele was bent on winning Arthur, and the major was, unconsciously, made subservient to her purposes. To have the latter hovering in her train, echoing her praises and watchful for her smile, rendered her the service of luring others, and of making Arthur jealous. Even Lady Grace had fallen under Adele's witchery. She had never been quite resigned to her daughter's devoted attachment for me, and now this feeling was but ill concealed. It revealed itself at times, in half-angry expressions to Florence, in cold and averted looks to me. We were, indeed, a very uncomfortable household on this festive day.</p> 
               <p>The banquet in the servants' hall passed off jovially, however. There was plenty of good cheer, and when the guests were seated, Arthur and Florence, accompanied by Sir Robert and Lady Grace, entered, and were received amid hearty cheers. "Long life to the young master!" and "blessings on the young lady!" and hearty wishes for the father and mother, greeted them on all sides. Looking on their beaming faces, one almost forgot that Ireland was not the centre of social and political happiness, but was torn by contending factions, full of unrest and dire dissatisfaction. Arthur made a neat speech, acknowledging the pleasure it gave<pb n=""/> him to hear their good wishes, and expressing a hope that he might always deserve their highest esteem.</p> 
               <p>The speech was received with much applause and exclamations of hearty good-will. "Never fear, master, we know you!" and "God bless you and all yours!" cried many a cheerful voice.</p> 
               <p>Arthur never appeared better than when on this day he responded to the good wishes of his people. His face flashed and excited, his manner suave and kindly, his eyes kindled to warmth, made him look the fit representative of their interests; a brother, who, by his height above them, was more capable of understanding their necessities and desires, and who would be warmed, not injured, by popularity.</p> 
               <p>In the evening, when all the rooms were thrown open and brilliantly lighted, the effect was very imposing. The Hall was an ancient structure, massive, roomy, covering a large extent of ground. It had, however, been so often repaired and modernized by its prosperous owners, that its antiquity was not suggestive of any decay or gloom, as is sometimes the case.</p> 
               <p>The wide hall of entrance, lined on either side with flowering plants and rare exotics, led to the ball-room, where, seated upon a raised platform at the farther end, a band of musicians were filling the air with inspiring music. The large apartments on either side were devoted to promenaders, or those wishing to employ themselves in any other way, and means of enjoyment were plentifully at hand. The walls were hung with paintings by celebrated masters; rare statuary gleamed here and there in many a niche; antique vases, gems of curious workmanship, and cabinets of costly, quaint,<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC5593-00000092"/> and curious relics, portfolios of exquisite engravings, and everywhere the picturesque architecture of the mansion itself, combined to cheer and delight the eye.</p> 
               <p>In the large apartment, as you crossed the hall, were extended rows of tables on either side of the room; these were for the card-players. For gambling was the vice and the passion of the age, extending to all ranks, but most extensively practiced by the higher ranks, among whom, even in private circles, fortunes were squandered; the winner not scrupling to take from his nearest friend.</p> 
               <p>In the course of the evening this room became the centre of attraction among those past the age for dancing. Statesmen, judges, commoners, even dignitaries of the Church, with their elderly wives, and sometimes their sons and daughters, might be seen around these tables; and few or none cared to play without the risk of at least some small stake.</p> 
               <p>Sir Robert, Lady Grace, Florence, and myself were early down to receive and welcome the guests as they came; and, as the room filled, and the varied colors of the ladies' satins and brocades and costly silks glowed under the innumerable wax-lights that from chandelier and gilded sconce sent down a flood of radiance, while the rich window-draperies of scarlet and gold lent depth and effect to the scene, it all seemed like some dazzling dream, some magic scene evoked by an enchanter's wand, to vanish when the spell was broken.</p> 
               <p>Never had I seen Florence quite so lovely as on this evening. Her animation, her desire to please, brought out that beautiful play of expression which constituted her chief attraction; tall and slight, her every movement<pb n=""/> ment was girlishly graceful, and her manner, if somewhat timid, was natural and unconstrained. No high society, no conventional etiquette, could frost over that native warmth and ingenuousness of character which made Florence always gently and beautifully <emph>herself</emph>-to be made and unmade at the bidding of no fashion or social arbitration.</p> 
               <p>Her dress, compared with the gorgeous toilettes of the evening, was exquisitely simple. Sir Robert had presented us each with a set of pearls as a birthday gift, and we wore no other ornaments. But Florence needed no adornment other than beautiful hair of rarest tint, which, waving around her fair face and ivory throat, fell over her shoulders and blended with the pale blue of her long gauzy dress, adding to the ethereal beauty of her aspect.</p> 
               <p>That night, that gay scene, that innocent girlish face, are indelibly stamped on my mind by the strange circumstances which followed.</p> 
               <p>Neither Adele nor Arthur had yet made their appearance. It was getting late, and Sir Robert grew impatient, as these two were to lead in the dance which opened the ball.</p> 
               <p>At length, a momentary hush, and an involuntary falling back of the crowd about the doors, announced an entre, and Adele appeared upon the scene, magnificently attired, and supported on either side by Arthur and Major Trenchard, while Captain Fortescue, in full military splendor, followed in her train.</p> 
               <p>A low bending of the jeweled head, a queenly sweep of the glimmering satin, acknowledged the general murmur of suppressed admiration which greeted her<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC5593-00000093"/> entrance. She certainly deserved this compliment, for her appearance was strikingly elegant. Her dress was in admirable keeping; the short waist, the fully-exposed neck,-which was the fashion of the time,-the bare arms, the long, sweeping train, with its rich folds clinging to the person, showed to advantage the fine proportions of her full, commanding form. Brilliants and emeralds, in compliment to the occasion (as she informed us), adorned her fair bust and encased her snowy arms, and in her taper gloved fingers a jewelled fan flitted coquettishly.</p> 
               <p>Graciously the lady approached us, radiant, triumphant. Perhaps the recent buzz of admiration had overcome her prudence, or she certainly would have had too much good taste to excuse to Florence before so many the remissness of Major Trenchard in coming so late, on the ground that he had promised several days ago to wait for her (Adele).</p> 
               <p>I saw that Florence was annoyed, though she laughed lightly, and taking Arthur's arm led the way to the ball-room; Adele followed with Major Trenchard, and I with Captain Fortescue. Arthur showed no sign of recognition. If our hands touched in the mazes of the dance, no lingering, electric thrill awoke at their meeting. Surrounded by this glamour of light and warmth and splendor, we two were far apart, icily courteous, more distant than the separation of acknowledged enmity. I was almost glad of this; for had Arthur shown any returning tenderness, I could scarcely so well have sustained my part. The captain was devoted to my service, and I flattered myself I received his profuse compliments with considerable spirit. The<pb n=""/> desire to show myself perfectly indifferent and quite unembarrassed by his attentions, inspired unwonted ease and freedom, and a quickness of repartee I scarcely knew I possessed. When the set was through Florence was much fatigued, and Arthur led her away from the crowd to a quiet seat in an oriel, but at once returned and joined the promenaders, among whom were Adele and Major Trenchard.</p> 
               <p>I certainly thought that now, at least, the major would return to his liege lady; but he did not. Adele for this evening seemed to hold both gentlemen fast in chains. Her consummate skill was shown in the easy way in which she played one off against the other, while each in turn felt himself the favored one.</p> 
               <p>In the course of the promenade we came to where Florence was seated. Of course a group of flutterers and flatterers surrounded her, but the one who should have been at her side was recreant, and I who could read that ingenuous countenance so well, saw, through all her efforts to be gay and indifferent, that her heart was full of pain and mortification.</p> 
               <p>Major Trenchard remained beside her a few moments in conversation, but it was evident his thoughts were elsewhere, and as we passed on he excused himself and joined Adele.</p> 
               <p>Florence, however, betrayed no want of spirit; she mingled among the guests, introducing those who needed introduction, and seeking out those who seemed to be neglected, promoting the friendly feeling among her guests, and drawing about her a charmed circle of happy faces wherever she went.</p> 
               <p>My friend, the captain, in the course of our extended<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC5593-00000094"/> promenade exerted himself to be agreeable, and there was something in his manner that was certainly pleasing; a frankness that inspired like frankness; an apparent independence and sincerity of thought that won confidence. As he chatted on gayly, interspersing his speech with many compliments, and bending over me with eyes that said all flattering things, a strange mood came upon me-strange, at least, for the time and place. I turned upon him abruptly:</p> 
               <p>"Captain Fortescue," said I, "do you know to whom you are speaking?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I think I do," he answered somewhat confusedly.</p> 
               <p>"Would you address me thus did you know that I was a peasant's daughter?"</p> 
               <p>I saw that he knew it; his face flushed, but he answered promptly, "Nature sometimes ennobles by her own perfectness."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, nature has done much for me, in giving me a good sound constitution, but good friends have done more. Had I been reared in my father's cabin, I would, no doubt, have been a stout, hearty maiden; but the crude material needed the education, association, and happy circumstances in which I have been placed, to make me what you say I am."</p> 
               <p>"True; I understand," he said; "we have the diamond in the rough, but the precious material must be polished to produce the brilliant."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, you misunderstand me!" I exclaimed; "<emph>I</emph> am no diamond. I do not presume to any innate worth. I only wanted to express my gratitude to those who have done so much for me, and to show my consciousness<pb n=""/> sciousness of what I am. I wish to appear no other than myself, for anything like deception my very soul abhors."</p> 
               <p>"Well," he said, laughing, "there I see the diamond gleam; but let us leave these abstruse and sober themes. I accept you-pardon my plainness-as one of the most splendid, nay, <emph>the</emph> most splendid woman in the room, and I do not care to analyze how the thing came about."</p> 
               <p>Glad to turn the conversation, I expressed a wish to look at the card-players for a few minutes.</p> 
               <p>We found the room thronged, each player eagerly absorbed as if his or her life depended on the game. Every table was occupied. The groups around some were silent, but most were laughing or chatting in a careless way. On the green covers of the tables in the centre were piles of small silver coin, and, as these passed from loser to winner, sometimes a hearty laugh attested a light heart and a heavy purse; but as often the looker-on detected a dark frown, an eye that betrayed disappointment and gloom.</p> 
               <p>"Do you see that elderly dowager?" said my companion, pointing to a stout, highly-rouged, overdressed old lady, busily engaged at one of the tables on the opposite side of the room, "that is the Honorable Mrs. May. She is said to be one of the most accomplished gamblers in Europe. She won all his estates from my lord the young Earl of Chichester, and a compromise was made by his marrying the worthy lady's daughter; such, at least, is the scandal. But here they come;" and a beautiful woman, leaning on the arm of a small, delicate, and slightly-deformed<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC5593-00000095"/> young man, approached the table at which the old lady was seated.</p> 
               <p>"I think her beauty might have justified her aspiration, without any compulsory motive," I said. "She strikes me as quite the superior of the two."</p> 
               <p>"She is," said the captain; "but the world has another standard, you know, and rank outweighs every other advantage."</p> 
               <p>Leaving the captain shortly after supper, I joined Florence, who was looking weary, surrounded by her busy, talkative, happy friends. Her face lighted up at my approach, and we sat down together to look at the gay groups coming and going, some making their adieux, and others arriving to take their places.</p> 
               <p>Presently we were joined by Miss Charlotte Neville; and her whispered remarks as each party passed in review, silly as they were, served to amuse us-and what else should one seek in a ball-room than amusement?</p> 
               <p>"Here comes my Lord Bishop of Dublin and his dowdy lady; that velvet hat has seen at least a score of winters. If I were he I would conceal my yawns until I got under cover of the old carriage. We can imagine the glorious nap he will have as they rumble home. I hope my lady has provided pillows and shawls; she must be used to it. Papa says the bishop's life is one long, luxurious nap, as well as her ladyship's.</p> 
               <p>"And here, close behind, is my Lord Castlereagh, courtly and conscious, and the delicate Lady Emily; she looks, indeed, as though she would wilt, but for the gracious attention of her lord.</p> 
               <p>"And my lord lieutenant and his lady, in that<pb n=""/> perpetual stiff brocade, like a bean-pole with a defunct vine clinging to it! If I were her friend, I-but here comes Lieutenant-General Lake, with a swarm of military men in his wake: captains, colonels, generals, every one of them, but General Lake is the star of them all."</p> 
               <p>I shook my head with vehement dissent, for the reports I had heard of this man's tyranny in his command had given me an abhorrence for him.</p> 
               <p>Two others came, equally distasteful to me: my Lord Clare, and my Lord Northampton.</p> 
               <p>"My papa says," observed Miss Charlotte, "they are the jolliest fellows in Ireland, and would rather any day sentence an Irishman to a whipping than follow the hounds. But excuse me, do; of course he only meant these rebels, you know; they deserve everything that's bad."</p> 
               <p>There was no use in being angry with this rattle-brained girl; she only repeated what she heard, and there was too much truth in her idle words. But I looked upon these men with horror, and turned from their smiles and gallantries with a feeling of the most profound contempt.</p> 
               <p>Adele and Major Trenchard now came up; the major was obliged to leave immediately. Arthur was not with them; he was engaged with other departing guests.</p> 
               <p>I saw there was some embarrassment in Major Trenchard's manner, but Florence seemed perfectly indifferent, and dismissed him with smiles, as she did the others. With Adele, too, she bore herself with the same polite nonchalance; replying with smiles to the<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC5593-00000096"/> anxious inquiries of the latter as to whether she had not over-exerted herself, and why she looked so pale.</p> 
               <p>Adele looked at the serene face of Florence, puzzled and baffled. She could have better understood her haughty scorn, and might perhaps have gloried in such treatment, but this style was beyond her comprehension.</p> 
               <p>Fatigued certainly the delicate girl was, but she did her part to the last. None were neglected or slighted, and light hearts and happy faces gave evidence of this as the guests bade us adieu.</p> 
               <p>Finally, the last of the throng departed, the festal lights were extinguished, the affectionate good-night kiss given to father and mother, and the mansion was silent.</p> 
               <p>"Olive," whispered Florence, as we retired to our room, "will you hurry Linda away?"</p> 
               <p>The girl had been nodding by the fire, awaiting our coming. I told her we would dispense with her services for that night, and she accepted with alacrity the permission to retire.</p> 
               <p>As the door closed upon her, Florence rose from the low seat where she had thrown herself, and, twining her arms around my neck, rested her weary head upon my shoulder, while the pent-up agony of hours burst forth in bitter sobs.</p> 
               <p>Not a word was spoken by either. I knew the depth of her feelings, and the utter mortification they had suffered this evening. Not only love, but pride had been outraged. She knew that the news of her engagement to the major had been whispered abroad, as well as among his brother-officers. She felt that curious eyes were upon her, that gossiping tongues were<pb n=""/> ready to take up the tale. And to be slighted before all; this was more than her young heart could endure.</p> 
               <p>I had no consolation to give. Incensed for her sake, I could only press her closer to my heart, while I endeavored to suppress the angry words that rose to my lips. Had this befallen myself, I might have framed an excuse for the desertion, but to one so unoffending it was more than cruel, it was inhuman. I knew that Adele did not care for Major Trenchard,-no, not one jot,-but his homage pleased her, and the stimulus of a mischievous triumph gave zest to all her efforts to bring him to her side. And then it helped to further her purpose; for a deep-laid purpose she had. I felt this instinctively; I knew it. But she had gone too far, and even her far-sightedness could hardly have foreseen the consequences.</p> 
               <p>Thus we sat, long and silently, close in each other's arms, until the poor girl, utterly exhausted by her emotion, lay quiet in my embrace. A faint shiver came over her, which increased till it seemed to shatter her very frame, as though she had been stricken by a sudden death-blow. I laid her on the bed, and, covering her up warmly, sat by her side until it passed off. A hot fever followed, which, burning out briefly and intensely, left her towards morning apparently more composed. But the sun was shining through every crevice of the closed windows ere we at length fell asleep, so profoundly that neither awoke until after midday.</p> 
               <p>I endeavored to dissuade Florence from rising when I did, but she insisted upon so doing.</p> 
               <p>"Olive," said she, "you are so tender of me. In<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC5593-00000097"/> thinking over my past life, I find I have only lived to be petted and made much of. I have grown to be a mere spoiled child, expecting everything, and giving nothing."</p> 
               <p>"Don't say so, Florence," I answered, hastily. "Your life has imparted joy and comfort to every one. You shine, you know," I said, smiling, "as the sun shines; we do not put the sunlight to the plow." I spoke lightly, for I wanted to rouse her from her sadness.</p> 
               <p>She looked at me thoughtfully.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I mean-I mean, I have only given that which it was no trouble to give. But I have made some resolves-yes, resolves," and she smiled. "You know I am now Miss Greyton,-properly recognized as such,-and I must prepare myself for the work I have to do. The sunshine, you see, is very busy this morning." She pointed to the window, through which the light was streaming, making bars of gold upon the carpet and a splendid shining and shadow in the room.</p> 
               <p>As I looked upon the pale young face-now so very pale-where, even with all the effort at smiling banter, traces of anguish were written, I could not but think that perhaps out of the struggle of that long, sad night, my friend had been born into a new and more matured existence.</p> 
               <p>The family were just seating themselves to the late breakfast when we joined them.</p> 
               <p>Florence had entreated me not to speak of her illness, but her paleness was noticed immediately by Lady Grace. It could, however, be easily accounted for. Sir Robert said pleasantly that his pretty Florence was<pb n=""/> not used to these hours of dissipation, and there must not be many more of them. But all anxiety was disarmed by his daughter's cheerfulness and sprightly manner. She chatted gayly of the people and events of the previous evening, and even when Major Trenchard came in, while we were still seated, she continued entirely unembarrassed.</p> 
               <p>I think he was touched by her paleness and the evidences of suffering in her face, for he spoke to her with unwonted tenderness. But although she replied as though she appreciated his kindness, I saw by the distance of her manner and its quiet dignity, that her determination was to allow him no more nearness of approach than she would have accorded the most ordinary friend.</p> 
               <p>He came with invitations to attend a grand review of the regiments of the south and southwest, to be held in Phoenix Park, Dublin, on the following day; after which we were expected to attend the levee of the lord and lady of the castle. A series of gayeties seemed crowding upon us, and if a shadow hung over them, a deeper meaning freighted them than ordinary frivolities, these things were not perceptible to the common eye.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">GAY SCENES IN DUBLIN.</head> 
               <p>THE world of fashion, meteor-like, moved on its brilliant course self-absorbed, all unmindful of the great pulsating popular heart that stood aloof looking on in mute dissatisfied wonder. There were the innumerable private entertainments; the grand public festivities, gala-days, bright shows, gayeties, and rejoicings occurring in quick succession. And if a thought or whisper did reach the general ear of lost hopes, despairing struggles, individual wrongs, they seemed so distant, so very vague, that amid the buzz and whirl they were lost and altogether forgotten.</p> 
               <p>On this morning of the much-talked-of grand review that was to come off in Phoenix Park at midday, the large open barouche, with its four spirited grays, postillions, footmen and coachman in the rich Greyton livery of brown and gold, stood ready on the broad graveled walk in front of the wide portico, to receive the ladies of the Hall. Arthur and his father were to follow on horseback.</p> 
               <p>The day was bright indeed; the clear sharp air of early March was cool and invigorating; a clear sky shone over the wide expanse of rolling country, bounded by the distant hills, just budding into verdure. It was truly an inspiring scene, fresh and beautiful to the eye.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Florence was still in her velvet and swan's-down.</p> 
               <p>"Papa would have it so," she said; "and I did so want to put on my new purple pelisse. He will always think I must take cold."</p> 
               <p>"My dear," said Lady Grace, "this fault-finding is not becoming."</p> 
               <p>"Fault-finding, mamma! I did not think of such a thing."</p> 
               <p>But I never saw Florence look more lovely, even with the despised swan's-down, than this morning. The white soft fur in contrast with the delicate bloom of the young cheek, the sweet pure eyes with that peculiar expression, that indescribable revelation of soul-depth in them, with the fascination of grace and motion which distinguished her, formed as lovely a picture as ever the eye rested on.</p> 
               <p>And Adele, sitting opposite, was all brilliance; dress was becoming to her, and she knew how to use it. But she was ill at ease this morning. Even the lively talk of Arthur, who rode up to say his adieux before starting, could not take her attention from Florence. I saw her furtive gaze, and, practiced as she was in the art of concealing her feelings, she could not altogether avoid showing something of that which was passing in her mind. She could understand the blanched face of yesterday, but not the tranquil, assured expression of today. She had looked upon Florence as the spoiled child of impulse, whose every emotion was mirrored on the innocent face, who could weep when disappointed, and laugh again when pleased. She had not given her credit for the deep, strong feelings of her nature. Perhaps this might be some excuse for her<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC5593-00000099"/> heartless tampering with this young creature's most inward emotions. Adele would have been prepared to meet the hardly-concealed expressions of mortified vanity, or perhaps the flippant impertinences she could have indulged in herself, and could have assumed the role of the martyr with great effect; but for this sudden transition into tranquil, assured womanhood, she was not at all ready, and for the first time in her life her easy self-confidence deserted her, and she almost quailed before the serene face and clear eye of the young girl before her.</p> 
               <p>But why dwell on Adele? Was it that a slight tinge of jealousy had so colored my perceptions that I could see nothing right in her? I had often asked myself this question. Others liked her; all who came in contact with her were charmed and fascinated. Lady Grace was her slave; even Sir Robert was pleased by her intelligence and constant effort to please. "Why need she trouble herself about an old fellow like me?" he had said. But Florence and myself saw all this in a different light. And might it not be that I was reading Adele's character untruly, by the light of my own antipathies? I had so long retained those vindictive feelings she had awakened in me in those early days, that in later times they might have unjustly tinctured my judgment. I tried hard to set aside my prejudices, to be just, but alas! that scene of years ago had branded itself on my memory. This was the same Adele who had sneered at my poverty, spoken to me so cruelly and cynically,-the same Adele, though clothed now in all the fascinations of a charming and worldly woman.</p> 
               <p>But I was sick and heart-sore this morning, notwithstanding<pb n=""/> standing the brightness of earth and air. And Arthur's animated chat, as he lingered beside Adele, called to my mind painfully the days when he was full of warmest interest for his sister and her humble companion. Yet I could not but acknowledge that Adele seemed well fitted to be his mate, and to uphold the dignity of the ancient house. And Lady Grace sat in her corner quietly looking on, bearing in her aspect the stamp of the lady of quality. Age had added much to the dignity of her appearance; her tall and rather angular form had become rounded and full; her smooth, full brow was unwrinkled by care, and her calm, untroubled eye betokened one at ease and peace with the world. She was richly and appropriately arrayed, she bore herself as one accustomed to recognition of her rank and station, and she smiled benignly on Adele and Arthur as they conversed together.</p> 
               <p>Yes, Lady Grace was content. Perhaps not one among the young hearts about her was so free from care, so happily exempt from petty annoyances, as her ladyship. She was not troubled with over-sensitiveness; she was thoroughly self-satisfied. Duty had been her watchword, and in retrospect it gave her pleasure to think of her long, prosperous life, in which she had certainly fulfilled that duty with scrupulous exactness. To be sure, there was little of the glow of love, or enthusiastic devotion, to reward her painstaking efforts, but she did not miss these; the world-that world so prized by her-acknowledged her worth, and honored her as one of its models. Her husband was easy and affectionate, never interfering with her plans; her children were dutiful and tender, and certainly any mother<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC5593-00000100"/> might be excused a little pride and exultation whose children were growing up as graceful and gracious as her ladyship's. I do not say that Lady Grace was exalted on this account, but if she had been it would have been excusable.</p> 
               <p>Why should not Lady Grace be contented? There was no drain on her sensibilities; her sympathies were limited; few made demands upon them, knowing by unerring instinct that she had little sympathy to bestow. The sorrows she could not assuage, the miseries she could not lighten, gave her no disquiet. The inner life of those about her was a sealed book to Lady Grace; she could decipher the title-page, the bold outline of the living "books" surrounding her, but further than that she could not penetrate-they were written in a dead language for her. Yet it must not be supposed that she was without feeling or sentiment, far from it. Her conversation was graceful and dignified, displaying much acquaintance with books as well as the world. Poetry for her had great charms, her ear was attuned to its finest cadences. Her tastes were perfect; her appreciation of art exquisite; but her understanding of all these was of the head rather than the heart, and therefore lacked warmth and full proportion.</p> 
               <p>But we must be off. Sir Robert rode up impatient at our delay. Arthur reined back; and then through the park road, shortening our way a little, we drove on.</p> 
               <p>With the fleetness of the wind our mettlesome steeds carried us over the twelve miles that lay between us and the capital, so that we arrived at the park before his excellency, with his generals and their brilliant staffs, appeared on the ground.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Occupying the immense area of the noble park devoted to such purposes, were drawn in line a vast body of soldiery, ready to receive, with due honors, their commanding officers. An imposing appearance they certainly presented, and one of enlivening interest, as they stood firm as statues, their polished arms upraised to the dazzling sun, and their scarlet coats flashing in its bright rays. Around this open space, even out to the park railings, were ranged the elegant equipages of the wealthy and fashionable, freighted with their merry groups of expectant sight-seers.</p> 
               <p>We had full time to look around, recognize some, and take in the extent of this great gathering, before the report of cannon coming in quick succession announced the approach of the heroes of the day. On they came with streaming banners and fluttering plumes, a gallant array; riding briskly forward, they made the sweep of the great circle, and turning sharply faced the long line before them.</p> 
               <p>The commander-in-chief, General Lake, now drew rein in front of his excellency, and, with courteous military salute, transferred the command for the hour to an honored guest. Then all were in motion again; with his excellency at the head, they dashed along the entire length of the line, receiving the military salute from each officer in position as they passed, making a glitter of swords that was almost blinding. Then burst forth the strains of martial music; triumphant, inspiring, full of human passion, full of human exultation. I almost forgot that these were men with bloody purpose in their hearts; men who only waited the behests of those epauletted and plumed officers to make havoc<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC5593-00000101"/> and ruin of all the fair scene about them. So lifted up does the imagination become under such circumstances! And when a halt was ordered, and the reviewing officers again stood still, as each regiment now in motion passed, dipping their colors, and marching from the ground with full bands of music at their head, each playing some soul-stirring national air, I was, like the rest, carried away by my enthusiasm; and responded in my heart to the loud burst of applause that followed them.</p> 
               <p>It was truly an imposing sight; and the stir, the hum, the buzz of many voices, the elation of spirits as the grand review closed and friends came crowding up to pay their respects, attested that enjoyment and exhilaration are by no means matters of pure reason, and that every bodily sense can be charmed and cheered, while the mind remains aloof, silent, irresponsive.</p> 
               <p>As I said, Florence was looking lovely this morning; the bracing air had kindled a rich color in her cheek, while the play of her beautiful features, as she naively expressed the enjoyment she felt, drew suppressed expressions of admiration from many.</p> 
               <p>Major Trenchard, too, was among the enamored gazers; but a sort of inward consciousness, apparently, made him slow of approach. He had left the staff-officers, when off the field, and taken a horse his servant held in waiting; and now as one who beholds a vision, he sat in the saddle, his hand absently caressing the neck of his impatient steed, but he came no nearer.</p> 
               <p>Looking at the major as he sat thus, apart, yet one of the gay crowd, it seemed to me that I could see the film falling from his eyes, and that Florence again<pb n=""/> appeared to them the beautiful, the pure embodiment of sweetest maidenhood that she had been on that day when she so suddenly came upon his dazzled vision in the lovely Glen of Downs.</p> 
               <p>Lady Grace also looked and listened with astonishment as she saw and heard her usually retiring daughter receive and converse so animatedly with all that came. She knew not the secret of that touch of bitterness that had entered the young soul, rousing to action forces hitherto slumbering. To us all she had been the sweet child, caressed and cared for; to-day she was the woman, commanding deference as well as love.</p> 
               <p>Major Trenchard saw this, or more probably felt it, though he scarcely comprehended its meaning. When at length he drew up to the carriage, Florence treated him with the same cordiality of manner that she did others, but nothing more. I ventured to look at him, and saw his face flush and his lips compress as he turned away and rode off.</p> 
               <p>He returned, however, before we left the ground, and rode home with us; but keeping on Adele's side of the carriage. That young lady seemed restored by his presence to something of her ordinary gayety,-for all the morning she had sat in haughty, gloomy silence, as though deeply offended from we knew not what cause. But if the triumph of Florence was unquestionable this morning, it was still greater on the following day when we attended the levee or drawing-room at the castle, for there even her fair compeers joined in the universal tribute of admiration; her sweet unassuming manner inspiring neither envy nor ill-will-the palm of beauty being naturally accorded<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC5593-00000102"/> her, as one would accord it to a rare combination of tint and odor and exquisite finish in a flower.</p> 
               <p>She ought not to have encountered the fatigue of this second day's excitement in her delicate state of health. Wiser heads than mine would have willed it so; but, her spirit rose superior to her physical weakness, and she would not be thwarted.</p> 
               <p>"Only this once, Olive, only this once," she said, playfully; and so we went.</p> 
               <p>The city of Dublin was at this time at the very zenith of its splendor, a very London in miniature,-fine streets, noble buildings, open squares and parks, and well-filled shops, displaying the richest goods. Statesmen and nobles, with a wealthy class of citizens, had their residences there; the public buildings were unrivaled for beauty of style and architecture; and, on this particular day, when all the devotees of fashion were assembling to pay their respects to the representatives of royalty, the streets presented a more than usually animated appearance.</p> 
               <p>The broad sweep of Sackville street, the great avenue of princely residences, was literally alive with the mass of rolling vehicles. Young exquisites, with whip in hand, were driving on their curricles; chariot, landau, and open barouche, crowded together,-for the fashion of vehicles, in that day, was varied to suit every fancy. Then there were the orderly close carriages designed to screen the full dress of the ladies from general view, side by side with the gay equipages whose owners did not care how many looked at them. A motley assemblage,-gay, eager, brilliant,-converging toward the same point.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Arriving at the narrow street in front of the castle, we found many there before us. A double line of carriages blocked the way, and we had to wait our turn with what patience we might. At length it came, and we drew up to alight. The entrance to the castle struck me as rather low; but the broad stairways and halls were spacious and imposing, and the state apartments magnificent. They were softly illumined by the afternoon sun, in whose mellow light the brilliance of the court-dresses showed to full advantage.</p> 
               <p>The gentlemen, in their many-colored, narrow-tailed, velvet coats, covered with embroidery, their small-clothes fastened at the ankle with the brightest of ribbons, their gold and silver buckled high-heeled shoes, their powdered heads, small swords and lace ruffles, vied in the fantastic gayety of their costumes with the highly-rouged dames they gallantly escorted.</p> 
               <p>When our party were presented,-the eldest first, and Florence and I together,-I wondered to find myself so entirely free from embarrassment. The crowd surrounding the sacred precincts of the raised dais, I was well aware, had all their batteries of eye and eye-glass ranged upon us, but I did not shrink. Had I known Arthur was among them, perhaps I might have been less composed.</p> 
               <p>Many pleasant things were said to us by their excellencies, and we could hear the whispered words of compliment: "Twin sisters, so unlike, yet so like in perfection of style and beauty;" "What grace; what dignity of bearing," etc. When we drew back among the crowd, we found ourselves still pursued by compliments<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC5593-00000103"/> pliments; many, even among the young ladies, sought an introduction.</p> 
               <p>"Bless your pretty faces!" said a kind old dowager. "But you must keep out of the wear and tear of such places as this, if you wish to preserve your bright bloom. It fades, my dears, it fades!" And her own well-rouged cheeks attested that she probably spoke from experience.</p> 
               <p>Captain Fortescue and Major Trenchard now came up, and extricated us from the crowd that hemmed us in, leading us to a small anteroom, where we could obtain seats. I was very weary, and, leaning back in the high-cushioned chair, too tired to speak, watched the actors and the scene about me in musing mood.</p> 
               <p>Adele was standing outside the door; I had her in full view. She was conversing with a gentleman, who eagerly described something he held in his hand. I said she was conversing; rather, perhaps, should I have chosen another word for the occasional reply that seemed to urge on her companion, as she scrutinized his countenance, bending her eyes upon his, and scanning even his dress and person as they talked. Adele was a sharp observer, but her penetration seldom extended deeply beneath the surface of things. No keen sympathies, no subtle emotion, suggested to her depths beneath outward ken.</p> 
               <p>There was no Spring in this young girl, either mental or physical; there had been in her nature no greenness and fragrance of opening and tender bud and bloom. Sentiment or passion were unknown to her. Self-possessed, observant, she could lay her plans wisely, watch their progress coolly, but, should they fail, she could<pb n=""/> bear the disappointment with philosophic imperturbability.</p> 
               <p>She was young, but a few years older than I was, yet she never seemed a fitting companion for either Florence or myself; beside her worldly wisdom, her knowledge of matters and things, we felt ourselves still mere children. And Adele was very wise in her way. The world was her study; in it she was determined to succeed. If her penetration was baffled by its deepest mysteries, its topmost strata was all before her, mapped out as clearly as though she had a hundred eyes. She was, therefore, perfectly consistent; setting her brain with vigor to the attainment of her purposes by means that she understood most thoroughly, and aspiring no higher.</p> 
               <p>Captain Fortescue was presently called away, and Arthur came to take his place. He offered me his arm, and we made our way through the throng. A gay woof and warp of many voices, of passing compliment and witty rejoinder, of greeting, parting, laughing salutation, and gathering up of costly robes, that rustled under foot-through this musical din, I caught the low, whispered words of my companion: "Olive, I can scarcely believe, as I look in your clear eyes and open face, that deceit lurks there. It is hard-"</p> 
               <p>"And do not believe it!" I said, almost piteously. "Oh, do not think this of me!"</p> 
               <p>At this moment Lady Grace approached.</p> 
               <p>"Arthur," said she, in a chiding tone, "how is this? Adele and I have been waiting for you."</p> 
               <p>Then Captain Fortescue appeared, and claimed his place by my side. The opportunity was gone which<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC5593-00000104"/> had seemed just swept within my grasp; the wave which had brought it, carried it waif-like away. Perhaps never again would occur the fortuitous moment in which I might hope to clear myself in Arthur's eyes.</p> 
               <p>It was almost dark as we approached the Hall. Arthur, who, with other gentlemen, was riding in advance, caught sight of a small boy loitering in the grounds, and asked him what he wanted.</p> 
               <p>"I have something for Miss Olive," said the lad; "but I am to put it in her own hand."</p> 
               <p>"Well, there she is, just coming up. Give it to me; I will hand it to her before your eyes, my boy. Will not that answer?"</p> 
               <p>I saw him take the note and look at the superscription. He knew the handwriting, apparently; even in the dusk I could see his face darken as he approached.</p> 
               <p>"Here is a note from Walter," he said, curtly; and I could have cried in the bitterness of my heart.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">FLORENCE.</head> 
               <p>BUT all thought of self was soon lost in anxiety for Florence. The severe tension of nerve which she had undergone, in her determination to carry out her part during the last two days, had been too much for her delicate frame; weakness and utter prostration followed, and she was very ill. Still she entreated me not to alarm any one in regard to her.</p> 
               <p>"It was my own obstinacy, Olive; I would go. Now, with rest and quiet, I shall be quite well again in a day or two. You must stay by me, and if mamma comes, tell her I am terribly fatigued-and-and-" she shuddered-"do not let Adele come near me."</p> 
               <p>Of course it excited no surprise that Florence did not appear the next day. "I thought she was doing too much," said Sir Robert. "She must rest now from all this excitement."</p> 
               <p>Alas! he did not know the secret excitement, from which no rest, no soothing anodyne, could ever restore his beautiful child. And even when Lady Grace visited the darkened room, and saw the delicate girl apparently asleep, at least very quiet, and with eyelids closed, she felt no apprehension that anything was amiss. How blind we all were! how sadly ignorant of what this peace and silence foretokened!</p> 
               <p>The following day Florence was much better,-able<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC5593-00000105"/> to sit up. Her father sent to ask if she was able to see him for a few minutes, and presently presented himself, bluff, hearty, and sympathetic, at her door.</p> 
               <p>He was evidently a little startled at her attitude of feebleness; but she greeted him with a smile so bright that he forgot his fears.</p> 
               <p>"But we must have Dr. Fitzley here, my darling. I see that you are not rid of that cough yet."</p> 
               <p>"No, papa, it is only a little additional cold-and all my own fault-going out in fall dress, bare neck and short sleeves. I do not need the doctor."</p> 
               <p>"Confound these balls and dresses," said the irate Sir Robert. "But, Florence darling, I have something to say to you about-about business, or something that concerns you, concerns us all-your happiness. Shall I speak now, or will it weary you too much? I can wait."</p> 
               <p>"No, indeed, papa, it will do me good to hear whatever it is you have to say," was her answer, cheerily.</p> 
               <p>"You recollect, Florence, that some months ago, when Major Trenchard asked your hand, I objected to a final engagement, on account of your youth, and because you had not yet appeared in society."</p> 
               <p>"I remember, papa."</p> 
               <p>"Well, my darling, he has now come forward handsomely, and renewed his proposals. Handsomely, I say, because that which was before a possibility has now become a certainty. His uncle having died childless, Major Trenchard is now Earl Jocelyn, and hastens to lay his honors at your feet. You know how it would please your mother to see you the wife of an English nobleman; but that is neither here nor there,-that is<pb n=""/> as you please. My girl may make her choice, and it is <emph>she</emph> will honor the one whom she selects."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you for that, papa."</p> 
               <p>"But I have forgotten one thing which I know will gratify you. He wishes me to assure you that as soon as honor will permit, he will retire from the army, so that you will not have the unpleasant thought that the one nearest to you is in arms against your own people, and the country you love. That is gallant, Florence, more almost than I should expect of a soldierly fellow like Trenchard. Now, what shall I say to him, my daughter?-but of course you want time, there is no hurry."</p> 
               <p>"No, papa, I do not want time;" yet still she hesitated, and a look of deep distress clouded her sweet face. At length she said, laying her hand caressingly on his: "Papa, I have ever spoken to you frankly every thought of my heart."</p> 
               <p>"You have, my dear."</p> 
               <p>"But now, papa, I am a little afraid to speak."</p> 
               <p>"Afraid! that is a strange word! Why afraid?"</p> 
               <p>"Because I cannot meet your wishes,-I cannot marry Major Trenchard."</p> 
               <p>"Bless me, child, you can't mean this!" exclaimed her father in the utmost astonishment. "This will kill your mother. He is a gentleman-you have known him long enough. What on earth is the matter, Florence?"</p> 
               <p>"Papa, don't be hard on me. You remember you said yourself then I was but a child, that, like a child, I was pleased with a new toy; that I must wait till I knew a little more of my own mind. And I have<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC5593-00000106"/> waited, and now, papa, I know my own mind. Surely, you would not ask me to marry one whom I do not love?"</p> 
               <p>"No, no, sweet child, there will be no urging on my part. But it is a tempting offer, and for your own sake I hate to give it up. But do as you please; you girls are all a mystery to me. I might better have let your mother talk to you about it."</p> 
               <p>"Now, papa, let me ask you to break this matter to him gently. I appreciate the honor he has done me, and am grieved to give him pain."</p> 
               <p>"Well, well, I will do my best; but it is like cutting a man's throat gently,-you cannot by that lessen the pain."</p> 
               <p>But Lady Grace was not so easily disposed of. She was severe and determined. She could not comprehend any reason for the change.</p> 
               <p>"Not love him?" she said, almost sharply. "You will learn to love,-and young ladies do not marry for that alone. They have social duty to regard, wealth and position to consider. And look how happy the majority of married women are. Florence, Florence, my heart is set on this thing, and you have grievously disappointed me."</p> 
               <p>At this the poor girl utterly broke down. She sobbed bitterly, but said: "I cannot do it, mamma, oh, I cannot!"</p> 
               <p>When Lady Grace was gone, I drew my chair beside Florence and soothed her as best I could; but she would not be comforted.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, what-what shall I do!" she cried.</p> 
               <p>"Now, Florence dear," said I, coaxingly, "you are<pb n=""/> not well to-day. Everything will seem different to you when you are strong and bright again. Perhaps, darling, you have felt piqued a little by Major Trenchard's apparent carelessness of your feelings. Appearances were against him, I know, but you should not let that influence an important decision like this. I am sure he loves you sincerely; I have watched him closely the past two days, and I feel assured it is so." She made no answer.</p> 
               <p>"Now, do not, dear, on the first blush of a mortified sensibility, throw away your happiness, and what will make your family so happy. I might do it; but it is not like you, Florence. You do not, I am sure, love any one else?"</p> 
               <p>"No."</p> 
               <p>"Then I know your nature so well that I am sure you could not but love one who depended on you for comfort and happiness. Do, I entreat you, think it all over again, before you make your refusal final."</p> 
               <p>She listened with her usual sweetness and patience until I was through, and then sat as if musing. Presently she said, "Well, Olive, I have become an enigma to myself. Until lately I scarcely knew that I had a self. I lived without thought, like the birds in the summer sunshine,-but to flutter and enjoy; and you all helped to spoil me. You petted and fondled me, and, until these new circumstances came up, I did not know there was anything but happiness for me,-anything but tenderness and worship. I made a flowery shrine for myself, and imagined that I was something better than earthly,-to be treated with delicious care and reverence, to be fed on incense, to be sung to and<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC5593-00000107"/> prayed to, I suppose; but never to feel the ordinary sufferings and trials of life. But the lamps have gone out on my shrine," she said, with a smile; "they forgot to trim them, and in the chill and darkness I awoke and found I was not a goddess.</p> 
               <p>"But it is better so, Olive," she added, after a pause. "If I have lost, I have also gained. I am disenchanted, like one whom a sudden and powerful blow has, for the moment, stunned, but who has been aroused after the first deadness of sensation. Aroused to quicker life, to unwonted alertness of every faculty. I can think now; I can reflect now; and this decision, which to you may seem hasty, is far from it, Olive. I have weighed it well; considered it on every side. Did Major Trenchard love me, as I can imagine some might love, I would hesitate to give him up even were he a man of many faults. Yes, I would sacrifice myself, and spend my life for his happiness; even though I could never resuscitate the dead love he has lost. But he cannot love so. He has not depth, nor strength, nor fervor enough. I now read his character clearly. Neither will he suffer as others might. He has sensibility; but let others forget, and he will soon do likewise."</p> 
               <p>I knew that what she said was true, and in my heart of hearts honored her for her truth and courage.</p> 
               <p>"And, Olive dear," she continued, "I do not think I deceive myself, when I say that it was not jealousy which first altered my feelings. I knew the major did not really care for Adele, nor Adele for him. She had other aims in view. She used him but to further her purpose, while he was pleased and flattered by her attentions."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"She knows how to use her weapons," I said; "and even shrewder and better men might have been lured by her wiles."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Florence, "that is true; but I am getting very weary, Olive. This long excitement has been so wearing. Oh, how tiresome have been, day after day, these trivial annoyances! Too trifling to speak of as they came one by one, but together in one sad aggregate a mighty sum. But when the final blow came, and I realized deliberate slight and open insult, it was a deadly blow, Olive. My heart is as stone,-I could not love-I could not associate with Major Trenchard again, if my very life depended on it."</p> 
               <p>"Well, love, we will talk no more of it. Rest now, and try to recover your strength."</p> 
               <p>"Recover!" she repeated, with a strange smile. "Olive, this has grieved poor papa and mamma, has it not? And I am afraid-I am afraid there is a greater trial in store for them. But, as you say, Olive, I must try to recover, for their sakes."</p> 
               <p>This was the first allusion Florence had ever made to any fears regarding her state of health, and it frightened me. I could scarcely command my feelings. Doubtless this was perceived by the invalid, for she said gayly, "One is always so childish when one is sick; especially if one is spoiled by too good nursing. You must spur me up with a round scolding, Olive."</p> 
               <p>And again I wrapped myself in fancied security, deceived by her playful voice and brilliant eye. I had seen her just as feeble as now, with a slight cold or other ailment. She always loved to have me nurse and pet her under these circumstances, and seemed to enjoy<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC5593-00000108"/> our seclusion from the rest of the household, our quiet reading, our friendly chat, the careful and pleasant process of becoming "convalescent." I thought, "After all, this illness will pass away as others have."</p> 
               <p>But Major Trenchard was not going to resign his bride so easily. He saw the value of the prize as he was likely to lose it. The idea of a refusal had been so far from his thought, the fact so unexpected! Ah, this was his great mistake; he had felt too secure. He had not comprehended the firmness as well as the fineness of character which Florence possessed.</p> 
               <p>Sir Robert was a little disposed to be vexed at the surprise, the almost incredulity, with which his daughter's decision was received by Major Trenchard. But after the first burst of disappointment and indignation was passed, the good baronet was really moved to pity; the undisguised distress of the young man rendered his violence pardonable, and the father listened to his entreaties for a personal interview, that he might learn his fate from the lips of Florence herself.</p> 
               <p>"Not to-day, however," said Sir Robert; "she is really very ill, and has been too much excited already."</p> 
               <p>"Then to-morrow, or to-morrow again," said the excited man; "for again and again I will return till I see her."</p> 
               <p>"Then let it be to-morrow, papa," said Florence, when she heard it, "for I want to have it over."</p> 
               <p>I helped her to rise and dress that morning, and she sat fragile and pale in the chair by the sunny window of our sitting-room.</p> 
               <p>I dreaded this interview for her. I had spoken no word on the subject, and I could not determine whether<pb n=""/> her resolution was still unchanged. Her face beamed with a peculiar expression as he entered,-an expression allied to pity. He had once been very dear to her; and her gentle nature, I knew, shrank from giving him pain. But there was a dignity, a composure in her manner, as of one removed by an impalpable barrier from the immediate fret and vexation that chafed the world about her. I could not tell how it would end.</p> 
               <p>As he entered our modest apartment, there was considerable haughtiness in his air: he was not used to the role of a humble suitor. This, I think, helped Florence. It roused her pride and spirit.</p> 
               <p>"Florence," said he, taking a chair and seating himself beside her, "how is this? am I to believe it? have you really determined thus lightly to throw aside my love, my devotion? I cannot believe it! Say it was but a fancy; a passing whim to try my love. Yes, we will let it pass. I will never, never name it again. Oh, say this, Florence; say it was but a fancy!"</p> 
               <p>She did not answer.</p> 
               <p>"Then where," he added, as if her silence had uttered the "no" he dreaded, "where are all those promises, those professions, I have listened to? Were they all meant to lure me on; to add something to your triumph?"</p> 
               <p>Poor girl! she trembled. I saw her lips open, as if to speak, but no sound issued from them.</p> 
               <p>Then a gentler mood came over the disappointed lover, and he plead with her tenderly; oh, how tenderly! But it was the eloquence of one who deems that he alone is the injured party. He could forgive,-he<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC5593-00000109"/> would forgive,-he could ennoble himself in the act of forgiveness; but he could not demean himself to admit that he himself was the wrong-doer.</p> 
               <p>Yet I felt a keen pity for him. It must be a struggle, a bitter struggle, to give up forever one so lovely and lovable. And I waited with breathless interest the answer from her lips. Could she repeat that fatal word? could she, so weak and helpless, firmly say "No," and cut herself adrift from this old, dear love?</p> 
               <p>A deadly pallor overspread her face. I thought that she would faint, and hastened to her assistance, applying restoratives, and fanning her back to a semblance of life.</p> 
               <p>"Florence," said the major, "I pray you, for God's sake, to speak! Relieve this suspense. Say you accept or reject; it is all I ask. Speak!" he cried, earnestly, almost fiercely. "I have a right to ask it."</p> 
               <p>"I <emph>will</emph> speak," she answered, in a low, but distinct voice; "and I repeat, Major Trenchard, that, although much obliged for your renewed offer, I cannot accept it."</p> 
               <p>He threw her hand from him as he sprang angrily to his feet, and, fixing his eyes full on me, said, furiously,-</p> 
               <p>"There is some devilish plotting, some influence here. This is not your own work, Florence; and, by heaven, I will get to the bottom of it!"</p> 
               <p>He turned as if to rush from the room.</p> 
               <p>"Stop, Major Trenchard!" cried Florence, with a decision that commanded attention. The deadly pallor that had overspread her face was displaced by a flush that brightened with the words she spoke. "You force<pb n=""/> me to say that which I desired to leave unspoken. I will not have others censured for that in which they have borne no part whatever. Those to whom you have dared to make reference have entreated me, for your sake, to reconsider, to hesitate, to be slow in pronouncing that word of separation which can never be unsaid. But I have decided unchangeably; oh, not eternity itself could alter my decision! My friend, it was your own hand, no other, inflicted this fatal wound that will not heal again at soothing words and chiding voice. Your own conscience must admit that I speak the truth. You may find many still to love you; I trust you will. I pray you not to sport with their affections as you have with mine."</p> 
               <p>She turned her face away. The action, full of significance and farewell, was understood by the listener. There was nothing more to be said; it was all at an end.</p> 
               <p>Perhaps he left the room a wiser and more thoughtful man than he had entered it. Perhaps a train of reflection had been started which might arrest the subtle selfishness of a character that saw all things as they bore upon himself only; that could understand no rights save his own.</p> 
               <p>Though I could not understand why any blame should attach to me in this affair, yet I felt that such was the case; a certain chill and dissatisfaction made itself felt in my mental atmosphere. Innocent of all blame, and knowing that I had used my influence to heal the difference between my friend and her suitor, I yet suffered keenly from this misapprehension. I was a plebeian, I was a dependent, yet I had dared to interpose my<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC5593-00000110"/> stronger will against a weaker, and disturb the existing serenity, the calm certainty of events, in "high society." So said Adele's not inscrutable countenance, so said Lady Grace's calm, stern face. But Florence turned on me her eyes of trust and faith, and I was satisfied.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">AN UNEXPECTED INVITATION.</head> 
               <p>IN the exciting circumstances following each other in quick succession during the last few days, I had forgotten Walter's note; indeed, Florence was the first to remind me of it.</p> 
               <p>"Poor fellow!" she said. "Did you not tell me something about his wanting to see you very soon?"</p> 
               <p>"True," I replied, and began to search for the missing note. I had felt so vexed on the evening when Arthur handed it me, so annoyed at this seeming confirmation of all the doubts I knew were in his mind, that I had thrust the scrap of paper into my pocket, scarcely glancing at its contents, and never wanting to look at it again.</p> 
               <p>But better thoughts came to me at last. Walter wanted to see me; no doubt there was some good reason for it. At any rate, the request was a very simple one. Walter was my old friend, at least. I owed him, as such, some courtesy. And, judging from the<pb n=""/> cool indifference with which he had repeatedly met me since that one painful interview, I knew that he would distress me with no further allusions to his personal feelings. Perhaps he had something to communicate in regard to my father, the time appointed for whose return was long past, and no tidings had been received.</p> 
               <p>The possibility of this having suggested itself made me very anxious to meet the appointment, and Florence, as usual, entered eagerly into my feelings. I must go, and at once.</p> 
               <p>When I urged the impossibility of leaving her (it was the evening after her painful interview with Major Trenchard), she looked up at me with a brighter sparkle in her eye than I had seen there for some time. "Why, Olive," said she, "where is your good sense and clear judgment now? Don't you see that I am really better? I feel as light and free as a bird. Don't think that I am wandering, Olive, but truly, since I have thrown off this crushing weight of indecision,-all this past, with everything belonging to it, all the wounded vanities and mortifications that beset me,-I feel like one suddenly relieved from an immense weight that was dragging them over a measureless abyss. I am out of the depths. I feel the air of heaven,-I see its blue above me,-I am weary, I am panting, but I am safe. Now, Olive, you'd better be off before my mood changes. I want to hear the news, you know. Letty will stay with me, and you will be back before mamma comes to say good-night."</p> 
               <p>Wrapping my cloak about me, I went my way without further delay, passing out through one of the side<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC5593-00000111"/> passages little used by the family, and let myself out without being observed.</p> 
               <p>As I walked in the shadow of the shrubbery through the lane leading toward the lodge, a horseman passed me, riding briskly toward the house. I saw at once that it was Arthur; he did not notice me, or if he did, no doubt thought the muffled figure one of the maids from the Hall.</p> 
               <p>He and I, so near each other once, were now far apart, strangers, enemies almost, it seemed. He had not been to see Florence in her illness, and I felt in my heart that I was the cause of his estrangement. No doubt he thoroughly despised me, and was averse to coming where I was. He had given himself over to pleasure, I heard, and was seldom at home; boating, riding, hunting, or at the club with the officers of the garrison at Arklow, so the heir of the Hall passed his time, and the old days of quiet pleasure which his sister and I used to pass with him seemed far away as a dim dream.</p> 
               <p>I sighed as I heard the tales of his dissipation; no doubt they were exaggerated, but I knew that there must be some foundation for them. And what a lost life it seemed for one so endowed, so full of energy and vitality! To spend the vigor and fullness of his youth in frivolity, when his country was in direct need of strong arm and manly heart to lift her from her peril!</p> 
               <p>And Arthur used to love his country,-in those old times I had seen his eye dilate and his cheek flush as he talked of its ancient splendor. He had been my warrior then, had Arthur, and we had held high talk<pb n=""/> together of how this sweet little isle should renew its glory and hold its place again among the honored of the earth. Alas! where were all these boastings now? Sadly I remembered the words of Mr. Massarene: that he hoped Arthur was all I thought him, but that he was yet untried. The time of trial had come now, and-but I turned my thoughts away from the painful topic, for just beyond me shone through the tiny diamond-shaped panes the cheerful light in the lodge window. A peaceful, quiet place it seemed, hidden in the shadow of its trees; and a feeling of regret, as for something lost forever, stole over me as, rousing myself from my distracting thoughts, I stepped upon the porch.</p> 
               <p>Quietly unfastening the door, I found myself in the presence of Walter and my grandmother.</p> 
               <p>Both were startled at my unannounced approach,-it was so late that they were not at all looking for me. But the warm welcome I received soon dispelled my gloomy thoughts, and the old ease and gayety that used to possess me whenever I entered the shining little parlor again wove its spell about my spirit.</p> 
               <p>Walter had shaken my hand with something of his wonted warmth, and my grandmother (a very unusual thing with her) had kissed me twice. I felt soothed and cheered and warmed. And then I had to detail all the news from the Hall. Every individual soul there was of special interest to her. "My dear, how is Master Arthur? He used to come and sit with me often in old times; but since his return from his travels he has not been at all. Is it true," she continued, "what they say, that he is so taken up with that English girl he has no thought for anything else?"</p> 
               <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC5593-00000112"/> 
               <p>This was rather an embarrassing question, especially as I saw that Walter was watching me closely. But I answered with assumed indifference that I did not really know; I had seen so little of Arthur lately I could not tell anything of his movements, or what influenced his actions.</p> 
               <p>Walter's gray eye wandered from the book in which he had been reading to the old lady, and rested, as I have said, intently upon my face as I spoke. I think I bore the inspection bravely, however, and kindly also, for that dim old volume reminded me how strangely kind and considerate Walter was to my grandmother, how devoted and attentive he was to one with whom he had few opinions in common. She was utterly conservative in everything, and their political opinions were widely different; but controversial subjects were avoided between them; he kept her apprised of all general matters of interest, talked with her of the weather, the crops, and like topics, and in the long winter evenings read to her from the old books she still remembered and loved.</p> 
               <p>Though now beginning to feel the weight of her eighty-three years, the strong and stately woman would not own to any failure yet. She still sat upright in her stiff-backed chair, and gave her orders with the precision of former days.</p> 
               <p>I was anxious to ask Walter about my father; his name rose to my lips, but I checked myself; it would not do to speak of his affairs before my grandmother, who, perhaps, was in happy ignorance of what had happened to him and his, and who had no sympathy with rebels and rebellion. Besides, I reflected that if there<pb n=""/> were anything to communicate Walter would undoubtedly find a way to do so.</p> 
               <p>After some general conversation, the latter said, pleasantly, yet with something slightly forced in his tone, "You will perhaps be surprised, Olive, when you hear what I wanted to see you for, and maybe you will be vexed, but I have your grandmother's sanction. She must protect me from your indignation, if I have presumed too far."</p> 
               <p>My grandmother nodded and smiled.</p> 
               <p>"After all, it is an odd request. I hesitate-"</p> 
               <p>"And why hesitate?" I interrupted, with some impatience; "haven't you a right to ask anything of me, Walter? Have I forgotten your kindness to me when I was a troublesome little girl, to say nothing of your goodness to my grandmother?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, that is neither here nor there. I have some scores to pay off on my own account. But, the fact is, Olive,-now do not hesitate to say nay, if you dislike the proposition,-the more I think of it the less likely I think it will be to meet your approbation."</p> 
               <p>"What <emph>is</emph> it?" I said, with some curiosity.</p> 
               <p>"Well, it is this: the boys insist on giving me a dance on the evening of my twenty-first birthday. It is to be at the widow Flanagan's. Olive, I wanted to ask you to accompany me. Is it too much to ask?"</p> 
               <p>I will own I was taken by surprise. The blood rushed to my face and neck; for a moment I did not reply.</p> 
               <p>"They're poor, but decent boys," said Walter, apologetically. "You'll meet there neither boys nor<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC5593-00000113"/> girls of your own kind, I know, Olive; but they want to do me a bit of honor, and I can't refuse it."</p> 
               <p>"And why should they seek to honor you, and I not do so also?" I said, hastily, now thoroughly ashamed of myself. "I will go with you, certainly; and with pleasure, too."</p> 
               <p>He seemed much surprised, and almost transported out of his usual calmness by my unexpected acceptance. Shaking my hand cordially, he thanked me again and again; his eye grew bright, his face beamed. Tonight he was again the old Walter of my childhood. The hour that followed is one of the brightest spots in my memory.</p> 
               <p>I would not let Walter accompany me up the avenue, preferring to return quietly as I came. I had no fears; indeed, there was nothing to fear. As I left, I asked in a whisper if he had heard anything of my father.</p> 
               <p>Nothing had been heard directly. But I was assured that he was safe and all was right; so, with a lightened heart, I kissed my grandmother, and, shaking hands with Walter, set out for home.</p> 
               <p>I found Florence sitting up before the grate, in which a cheerful fire burned. The little table, with its lighted candles, was drawn up before her; there were books and papers upon it. She had been enjoying herself reading, she said.</p> 
               <p>"But let me have the news," she added, as I threw off my cloak and sat down beside her near the fire. "What did Walter want to see you about?"</p> 
               <p>It had been a strange experience with us lately, that we could not speak our thoughts freely as they<pb n=""/> came uppermost; so many things had become painful and complicated, so many things had grown too delicate to touch upon, that without the slightest difference of feeling or diminution of friendship, we had tacitly agreed to leave them unspoken. But to-night my lips were unsealed; I could tell everything that had occurred. I expatiated on Walter, on his manliness, his wisdom, his conversational powers.</p> 
               <p>Florence kindled to enthusiasm at my words. "Yes, I always liked Walter,-what a nice, good fellow he is! And how handsome! What a pity he was not born a gentleman!"</p> 
               <p>"But he <emph>is</emph> a gentleman," she added, earnestly, as if in reply to her own remark. "Yes, a gentleman, just as you are a lady. Why, there are the Misses Neville, young Mr. Fortescue, and a number of others I could name,-silly, mean, and vulgar people,-and yet they are called ladies and gentlemen. Well, I could never get the thing straight in my mind."</p> 
               <p>"Neither would I try," said I, laughing, amused at the puzzled look on my friend's sweet face. "What I now want to know is, what you think about my going to this primitive ball."</p> 
               <p>Florence had been at first as much startled as I was at the oddity of the proposition, but freely said she was glad I had promised to go.</p> 
               <p>"There has been so much dissatisfaction among the people, they say, Olive, and everybody knows you are from the Hall, perhaps it may do some little good; who knows? Am I not something of a politician?" she said, smiling.</p> 
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC5593-00000114"/> 
               <p>"But how will it do to leave you so long? and what will Lady Grace say?"</p> 
               <p>"As to leaving me for one evening, I will fix all that. And mamma-I would not be afraid to tell her, but Adele is so-Well, I must not bear malice. But, Olive, we had better not say anything to mamma about it. I will shield you from blame; only leave it to me."</p> 
               <p>And so it was settled, and we passed to the all-important subject of what I should wear.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">MRS. FLANAGAN'S BALL.</head> 
               <p>PUNCTUALLY at seven o'clock on the evening appointed I was at my grandmother's, dressed for the dance.</p> 
               <p>Florence and I had exhausted all our ingenuity in the matter of dress. It was thought that, as a compliment to Walter, I should be well-dressed, and yet we felt that it would be a breach of taste to appear overdressed. At last we decided on a plain white muslin, with blush-colored sash, and a knot of rosebuds on my breast. Florence, in her fond partiality, saying, "Your own glorious hair banded round that proud, upright head of yours, is all the ornament you need there, Olive."</p> 
               <p>I found my own pony, with side-saddle on, waiting<pb n=""/> for me at the gate of the lodge. I would rather have walked, but Walter would not hear of it. "It was two miles and more to Enniskery," he said, "and he should be expecting me to dance, and we should have to walk home; for he had arranged to have the pony brought back by the boy Teddy."</p> 
               <p>As we paced leisurely along, Walter walking by my side, the early twilight was scarcely yet pale on the hills, and the purple heather tinged with a lingering gold, the soft and misty atmosphere, the shadows betokening coming night, made beautiful the distance and the nearness.</p> 
               <p>The silence, the loneliness, the freedom of such an hour out in the bracing air, suited me well. I felt its exhilaration, and as we rode forward, ascending the hedge-bound, slightly-rising road; I felt almost as if we were getting nearer those twinkling lights, those stars, now struggling dimly to assert themselves, but soon to claim the night for their own.</p> 
               <p>We did not talk, however; such a scene disposed us both to silence.</p> 
               <p>Reaching the top of the ascent, we entered the singular defile known as "The Scalp," a narrow pass, cut, as it were with one sweep, through a huge granite block. The legend tells that his Satanic Majesty, wishing to carry his herd to market,-his stout boars for shearing, probably,-found this tremendous mass of rock in his way. The Prince of Darkness never allowed himself to be impeded by slight obstacles, and had kicked his way through with his cloven hoof. And so the strange passage remains to the present day.</p> 
               <p>Passing through this wild gorge, the little village lay<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC5593-00000115"/> before us, among its high surrounding hills. The white cottages perched along the slope, each with its twinkling light, gave an amphitheatre-like aspect to the little town, seeming to ennoble it out of the commonplaceness of mere every-day life, as if one were entitled to expect better and gayer things of its inhabitants.</p> 
               <p>The house of the widow Flanagan, whither we were bound, was one of a group that stood on the outskirts of the village, by the roadside as we entered it. Approaching, we heard the sound of music and merry voices,-the evening was already begun. Walter assisted me to dismount, and pushing open the low half-door, we found ourselves in a roomy kitchen, with a bright turf-fire burning on the hearth.</p> 
               <p>There were plenty of warm greetings for us. "Ye'r late, Master Walter, but we're proud to see you any time." "And this is Richard Lacey's daughter, God bless her! an' come to the fire, acushla, and warm ye a bit. There's some little of the sea-mist in the air the night." From all I had an approving word. One aged dame sitting on the cruppy-stool in the chimney-corner, and sending up a cloud of tobacco smoke from a little old clay pipe, told me between each whiff that she knew my grandmother well in days gone by, "And a braw girl she was; and yer own mother, too, for the matter of that, mavourneen. A doucy, wee thing she was-but ye most favor the old lady," said she, looking at me approvingly.</p> 
               <p>Thus one and all had something to say in my praise, or for my pleasure; but there was nothing officious or obtrusive in all this; it was a kindly hospitality, wishing to make me feel at home, and was all done with a<pb n=""/> delicacy and tact that we only expect to meet with in more polished circles.</p> 
               <p>This outer room or kitchen seemed to be occupied by the more elderly guests, both men and women. When we first entered a dense cloud of tobacco smoke filled the apartment, but most of them had whipped the pipes out of their mouths on our appearance, only a few privileged old ladies still retaining them, looking both picturesque and cozy in their chintz gowns and wide-ruffled caps, as the odorous vapor curled about their heads.</p> 
               <p>Some cups of tea were being passed round, and among the sterner sex, too, for I heard one good old gentleman say, "I thank ye, Mrs. Flanagan; this is the finest cup of tay that ever crossed me mouth. Indeed, and troth it is. It would almost make a cat spake, Mrs. Flanagan!"</p> 
               <p>There was quite a bustle now. Some of the girls ran in, followed by their lads, to have their cups read by the old women, who were reputed, some of them, great proficients in the art of reading thus the secrets of destiny. But they beat a hasty retreat at the sight of strangers, casting laughing glances backward as they went, blithe, rosy-cheeked, and bashful, a cluster of as gay and pretty maidens as need be.</p> 
               <p>The next room, a large apartment also, was devoted to the younger revelers. The floor was nicely sanded, and the white walls were festooned with wreaths of evergreen, forming on the centre of the wall the name of "Walter Maury." It was a pretty compliment. There were plenty of lights,-candles burning in sconces hanging closely together about the room.</p> 
               <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC5593-00000116"/> 
               <p>As we entered, the music struck up, fife, fiddle, and flute joining gayly in "See the Conquering Hero Comes," and then I was formally escorted round the circle, in some places two and three deep, and presented as Richard Lacey's daughter. The girls made their little bob-courtesies, their faces and necks suffused with scarlet as Walter spoke to them, while the boys pulled their forelocks, scraping their feet on the floor with a great flourish, and bowing their heads very low.</p> 
               <p>As we neared the musicians I could not avoid a start and exclamation. Did my eyes deceive me? No, there sat Tim, our own identical Tim, not a whit altered, either; the same shock head, rough and huge, the same diminutive, twisted body, though now well clothed, and gentlemanly in appearance, and displaying, instead of the old black fife, a handsome flute. It was Tim to the life, and no other.</p> 
               <p>As he caught my eye he rose upright, straightening himself as he raised the instrument in the old fashion I remembered so well, and sending forth a weird and thrilling stream of harmony.</p> 
               <p>His associates did not attempt to follow him; such flights were far beyond their reach. The very soul of music seemed to dwell in Tim, and sometimes it must have its way.</p> 
               <p>We stood still, while all listened entranced. This was Tim's welcome, and I thanked him for the compliment with words and looks. Such music as this I had not often heard in the social gatherings of which I had been a participant, not even among the noblest and most aristocratic. It charmed and touched my<pb n=""/> very heart. Tim seemed delighted with my appreciation; his eye sparkled; pride and triumph seemed to transport him out of himself. This was not vanity, neither was it any feeling of superiority, but the real, artistic joy of recognition. For the man was a genius, I doubt not, and those who came under the witching spell of his music forgot his deformity, and treated him no longer as the poor and pitiable Tim, but as one to be duly honored and respected.</p> 
               <p>The centre of the room was now cleared for dancing, and the hostess entering, the musicians struck up the popular air of "Charming Mrs. Flanagan." One of the young men sprang up, and "cutting a pigeon-wing" in the air, approached the lady with insinuating smiles and both hands extended, humming as he did so,-</p>

               <p>The lady bowed and floated round a few steps in acceptance of this trial of skill, but before she entered fully into the spirit of the dance, carefully tucked up her bright calico, showing to advantage the scarlet petticoat beneath, as well as a pair of very neat ankles.</p> 
               <p>I looked on much amused; though stout, our hostess was light in movement, keeping time to the music as it dashed along, yet still preserving such an equanimity that there was no flurry or exhaustion. But her youthful partner was of another calibre; he went at his performance with vigor and gusto, working every limb, never sparing himself; sometimes springing into the air, then alighting in the graceful "shuffle," going through the steps with conscientious exactness, flourishing<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC5593-00000117"/> ing around his partner with whoop and crack of fingers, and spending himself so generously, that it soon became evident what with the heat and exhaustion he must presently give out.</p> 
               <p>"Barney, give up! own ye're beaten!" cried his friends. But Barney worked on heroically, though almost breathless. At length the widow herself came to the rescue.</p> 
               <p>"Now I'll own up," said she, "rather than you kill yerself, poor boy. Come, then, into the other room, and let's have a cup of tay."</p> 
               <p>Ah, this was the unkindest cut of all! Such a shower of raillery followed as would have seriously ruffled a temper less happy than Barney's."</p> 
               <p>Take it weak, my lad, or it'll be too much for ye. Let the widow have a care of ye, Barney!" And amid these flying shot, the pair retired to the next room.</p> 
               <p>Reels and jigs followed in quick succession, and then the country-dance, in which I could join. And glad I was to do so, for the spirit and life about me, the stirring music, inspired me, and Walter and myself went down the first set with much enjoyment. Going through the various figures, we reached the last of the couples, and then it was our turn to rest for awhile. As I looked around, my eyes rested upon a familiar face, and I recognized the broad, beaming, self-satisfied smile of our old friend Dolly Jamieson. Justly self-satisfied, for Mrs. Jamieson's goodly person was arrayed in its very best, and the red ribbons in her cap were of the newest and brightest.</p> 
               <p>"How do you do? And how is your husband?" I asked.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Matthew's well, miss."</p> 
               <p>"And is he here?"</p> 
               <p>"Indade is he, good man, and sore against his will."</p> 
               <p>And there, sure enough, was Matthew, meekly gliding along the walls, or lurking in the corners, to await the bidding of his rather imperious lady.</p> 
               <p>"And your brother?" I asked, remembering the little episode in his life of which I had been a witness. "Where is he?"</p> 
               <p>"Just forenent ye, miss." Yes, there he was, though in the crowd I had overlooked him,-a pretty, modest little maiden by his side.</p> 
               <p>"And is that Mary?" I inquired, in an undertone.</p> 
               <p>"Lord bless ye, no; that's the greatest fortin' in the country-side,-Peggy Moran. Her sister was married last week, and she had forty goold guineas put down on a mahogany table for her portion. And Peggy will have as much, besides the cow and feather bed, with a power of other things."</p> 
               <p>"But where is Mary?"</p> 
               <p>Before I could receive an answer to my question, however, I was whirled off in the mazes of the dance.</p> 
               <p>Our revel was about at its height,-every eye beaming brightly, every foot beating time to the merry music, when a scarcely-perceptible whisper went round, followed by a sudden hush, as an aged man entered the apartment. There was a sudden pause in the music, while all fell back to allow him free passage. His appearance was most venerable, as he bent forward on the stout stick that supported his trembling hands; but his eye was bright and clear as he returned the cordial greetings of those around.</p> 
               <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC5593-00000118"/> 
               <p>"Save your reverence, and may the heavens be about ye!" was among the ejaculations that met him on all sides, as he approached the chair some thoughtful hand had procured for him.</p> 
               <p>This venerable priest was no other than old Father Keane, "the good priest of Barran," as he was called, who had been Walter's early instructor, and was still his constant friend.</p> 
               <p>When he was somewhat rested, the old man said, "I am sorry to disturb you, my young friends."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no disturbance, your reverence!" they all exclaimed.</p> 
               <p>"But I have a little business with you to-night, and while I am thinking it over, let the boys give us a little music."</p> 
               <p>That enthusiastic leader, Tim, waited for no second suggestion,-a deep, pathetic prelude, a sad, wild wail, as from the unseen spirit that seemed to obey his behests, rose from his flute; fiddlers and fifers followed in some of Ireland's old national melodies, blending in with their leader in one weird and tuneful wail. There was no turbulent clashing of sound, no rush of battle, scarce a touch of hopefulness even, in these strange melodies; all was sad as the sighing of the wind, stern as the suppressed agony of the martyr. They were the songs of Ireland's anguish, not of her days of peace or prosperity.</p> 
               <p>A solemn silence followed. Tim seemed to hold a magic power over these impulsive natures. A few moments since they were bounding with life and gayety, keeping time to the intoxicating measures of a witching waltz; they stood now with folded arms<pb n=""/> and heaving breasts, as those who wait the fiat of destiny.</p> 
               <p>"Come, boys," said the old man, when a lull occurred in the solemn music, "this will not do; there is work for you, my lads. I have heard something this day, ay, have seen something this day, that has quickened my pulses with the spirit of vengeance. But, God forgive me!" he added, lowering his voice, "it is not my place to preach vengeance,-vengeance to those children dearer to me than the children of flesh and blood. But, lads, I have been sore tried this day, and if I dared,"-he ground his teeth, and his trembling hands struck the oak stick against the floor with a blow that shook the rafters, as he repeated,-"yes, if I dared, I would exterminate, I would drive from the land every red-coat, every sordid hireling who is bringing ruin and misery on our beautiful island. I would do it in the name of God; but, alas! I forget myself, vengeance is not for me."</p> 
               <p>"But vengeance is ours, father."</p> 
               <p>"No, boys, no; God forgive me for stirring up this spirit! You must have patience. Wait,-bide your time. And this brings me to my object in coming here. I want to introduce you to your captain, to one who will be cautious to preserve you from danger, but who will never flinch when danger comes. Step forward, my lad." And to my astonishment, out stepped Walter from the crowd pressing in.</p> 
               <p>"Will you accept him for your leader?" cried the old priest, his eye glancing at the tall, lithe figure, his strongly-marked yet benignant face beaming with pride in his old pupil.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE UNDER-CURRENT.</head> 
               <p>WALTER was in some sort a hero among his own class, than whom there are none more keen to discover and appreciate heroic qualities. Vigor, endurance, self-denial,-the qualities of leadership,-apart from any mere social good-fellowship, command a respect among them amounting almost to reverence. There was not one dissenting voice in the cheer that rose to greet him in token of acceptance as their leader and representative.</p> 
               <p>The musicians tuned their instruments to the martial strains of "Brian Borohme," and every voice joined in the chorus,- <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"Strike the harp, raise the voice,</l> 
                        <l>Sing the wrongs of old Ireland."</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q> During this burst of enthusiasm, the good father slipped quietly away. Scarcely had the echo of the song died, when an officer in British uniform made his appearance in the low doorway of the apartment. Unceremoniously approaching toward the centre of the room, in a loud, commanding tone he ordered the instant dispersion of the company. The girls and women turned pale: some of them screamed; the men stood as if petrified.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>The officer was Captain Fortescue; and, recognizing him, I at once made up my mind what to do.</p> 
               <p>"You here, Miss Olive?" he said, with a start, as I approached him.</p> 
               <p>"Let me speak with you one moment," I entreated; "one moment before any mischief is done." For hearing the hum of fierce voices, recovering from the momentary stupor, I knew there was not an instant to be lost, and I actually laid my hand on the captain's arm to lead him away. Walter came forward at this juncture, a fierce light burning in his eye.</p> 
               <p>"Walter," said I, "you must not stop me; I must speak with this gentleman alone. I will explain at another time; now let us pass."</p> 
               <p>Not another word was said; but, passing quietly through the throng, the captain and myself stood presently in the open space fronting the cottage.</p> 
               <p>A number of soldiers were grouped a little way beyond, and in the shadow of the doorway stood a silent figure, which I recognized as that of the strange monk, of whose treachery I had feared.</p> 
               <p>He touched Captain Fortescue's arm lightly as we passed, whispering something in his ear, then glided away as we went toward the road. I scarcely noticed this interruption, however, so eager was I to have these soldiers called off.</p> 
               <p>"There will be fearful work, Captain Fortescue," I said, "should they and those inside come in collision at this moment when their fiery blood is up. I pray you withdraw them, even for a little space."</p> 
               <p>He instantly acquiesced, almost to my surprise, ordering the men to march up the road a short distance.</p> 
               <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC5593-00000120"/> 
               <p>I then, in as few words as possible, explained the object of the gathering, and why I was there. My companion listened attentively, and replied that he was happy to say he would not, under these circumstances, be obliged to interfere with their merry-making. He had just been informed that the man they were in search of was not there, "And," he added, "we must be off at once in pursuit. It is an unpleasant business for me, Miss Olive, I assure you," said the captain, frankly; "I have learned to quite like your countrymen, belligerent though they be, but I must obey orders. We are hunting down an arch-rebel, one Richard Lacel, just arrived from France. He has brought some valuable papers from that government to certain parties here, and there is a price set on his head. These are the men that make all your troubles, Miss Olive."</p> 
               <p>I stood aghast to hear the name. This must be my father, though there was a slight mistake in spelling the name. The monk was, as I had feared, betraying him. I wondered that the captain did not connect my name with this, so nearly like; and read my terrible secret; but he did not. Adding that he was glad it was consistent with his duty to gratify me by a peaceful withdrawal, and wishing me a very good-night, he departed.</p> 
               <p>Great was the astonishment in the cottage when I returned alone. They had all been preparing for a desperate resistance. I explained to them through Walter that it was a mistake,-there was no intention of breaking up their social gathering; they were in search of some one whom they had supposed might<pb n=""/> be there. They did not know that that "some one" was my own father.</p> 
               <p>But the spirit and life of the occasion was over, and all were preparing to depart. Many words of congratulation, many a hearty hand-shake, were given to their new captain; and for myself, the good words that I heard, whether for my father's sake or my own, brought unwonted tears to my eyes.</p> 
               <p>Before Walter and myself started on our long walk, Tim had contrived to give me information that my father was near; that he wanted to see me; and that if I would be at the lower gate of the park on the next night, about eleven o'clock, he (Tim) would conduct me to my father's hiding-place.</p> 
               <p>Not having heard of my father's return, Walter was much surprised when I told him of Tim's communication, and he advised me to accept his offer of guidance without fear.</p> 
               <p>"He is a noble little fellow, this Tim," said Walter; "as trusty and true as steel."</p> 
               <p>As we walked on we talked over many matters. I expressed my gratification at the distinction which had been conferred upon him by these warm-hearted people; but added that I feared it was a distinction fraught with danger.</p> 
               <p>"Like most other distinctions," said the young man, with a smile; "but I intend to be very cautious, and may possibly do some good, in being able to restrain these impetuous spirits, so that they may not be driven too soon into the rebellion that must come some day. For I think, with Mr. Massarene, who has laid the whole matter before me, that the policy of the government<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC5593-00000121"/> ment is to drive us, by multiplied wrongs and cruelties, to sudden and immature revolt. That would be our ruin. Not a stir must be made, if we wish for success, until the plans now in progress are completed, and we can count upon the united action of the whole island,-north, south, east, and west. But we are sore pressed, though where you are (and I am glad of it, for your sake, Olive), you know little of the horrors attending the present state of things. This thirst for revenge and retaliation seems as natural as the breath we draw. "But," he added, "I trust for better things, though sometimes I have almost given up hope, for I see that something else than justice and right on our side is needed for victory."</p> 
               <p>We walked some way in silence, each absorbed in thought too deep for words.</p> 
               <p>Presently Walter spoke, in a manner so different from his usual collected and quiet bearing, that my heart gave a great leap. What I dreaded was coming, I knew, and I could not escape it.</p> 
               <p>"There is another matter, Olive, that I would like to speak with you about, if you will have a little patience with me."</p> 
               <p>I answered as composedly as possible, signifying my assent.</p> 
               <p>"My story may not interest you, Olive; it is not a sprightly one; I own to a painful despondency myself. But I have come to think that anything is better than this heart-wearing suspense."</p> 
               <p>Why need I repeat his words? The words of a passionate and manly love are never to be lightly heard by any woman. That which had dawned upon me in<pb n=""/> our interview in the conservatory was no fancy of mine; and it was with pain I listened to the avowal of a regard which I could not return.</p> 
               <p>"It has been all along a most desponding love, Olive," he said; "but at times some little gleam of hope would cheer me, and I would resolve to make myself more worthy of you. I would spur up my ambition, rouse my energy, that I might attain something nearer you; for you were ever my ideal, Olive, of all that is excellent and grand. More often, however, I have felt the pangs of bitter jealousy and despair. I know that I have been ungenerous to those to whom I owe much, and that I have been fitful and uncertain in my moods to you. Then, when I endeavored to overcome this feeling, to shun you, Olive, to shut myself out from your smile and your friendly eyes, I remembered that I had never told you of my love, and that I had given you the right to despise me for my whimsical and ungracious conduct. For this reason I have asked you to accompany me to-night, that I might find opportunity to speak with you alone, and know at last my fate. I accept it, whatever it may be."</p> 
               <p>But no answer was ready; sobs choked my utterance.</p> 
               <p>"Speak, Olive, my dearly loved. Let it be as it will, I can bear it."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, I perceive," he said, with some hauteur, as I still continued to weep: "you feel such pity for me."</p> 
               <p>"Yes; and for myself, too," I burst forth. "Oh, Walter, would that I could love you as you deserve to be loved!"</p> 
               <p>"But you cannot," he said, in a hard, almost harsh voice. "Oh, I understand! Still, you regard me with<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC5593-00000122"/> commiseration, a touch of tender regard; that is natural in you as a woman toward all who are in sorrow; I understand; but your love, that which is all you can give me that I could accept, this you withhold; this you reserve for another. I thank you, Olive, but I do not need compassion; I can stand alone, I think, even without your pity."</p> 
               <p>I gathered up my spirits at these bitter words. "This is unkind! this is cruel!" I said, hotly.</p> 
               <p>"Cruel?" he repeated, his temper now getting the mastery. "Who talks of cruelty? who is cruel? Do you know the death and torments I suffer? the hopeless life of misery to which you have doomed me? Do you know all this, and yet talk of cruelty?"</p> 
               <p>"I-I cannot-" the words died on my lips.</p> 
               <p>"Olive," said Walter, softening as he saw my agitation, "forgive me; you are not to blame in this. I must bear it all, and I will. I thought I was prepared for all this, but I find I was mistaken. Were this love," he added, in a low voice,-"this love I would so much have prized,-were it given to another than it is, I think I could bear it better; but I do not know-"</p> 
               <p>"Walter," I interrupted, now myself a little roused, "you have no right to place my affections anywhere until you know that they have been sought."</p> 
               <p>"True, my friend; but the eyes of love are sharpened strangely, and I have seen many things that needed no words to explain them." He spoke with some restraint and coldness, as if the words so spoken placed guard over further outbreak of passion.</p> 
               <p>By this time we had reached the avenue gate, and Walter bade me good-night, adding that he must go<pb n=""/> back to Father Keane's to meet some of the boys. "We have business yet to do to-night," he said.</p> 
               <p>I was heart-sick and sore; here from my sight was vanishing, with a cold touch of the hand, my early friend, my friend who offered me a real love, a real devotion, such as I might never know again; I was turning from his side toward a mere ideality, a shadowy, unhappy ideal, a love which could render me in this world neither happiness nor peace.</p> 
               <p>"Walter!" I said, stretching out my hands. "Can we not at least part as dear friends, as old friends, Walter?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," he answered, in his old, generous way; "I will always be your friend-after this is passed; for I could die for you, Olive. If it were not for the struggle that I see preparing for Ireland, if it were not that I must help her in her need, I would go away, never to return until I had trained myself to show the indifference I shall never feel in your presence; but I will try; I will be strong."</p> 
               <p>"And do you remember, Olive," he said, after a pause, "how many, many long years since, when you used to come down to the lodge of an evening, how you used to spring into my arms, clasp your little hands about my neck, and 'kiss me for joy,' as you said, 'Walter, I do love you'? And, Olive, once more, for the last time, darling; for you were my darling then, as, God knows, you are now-" His voice was broken; he caught me to his breast, gathering me to him with a frantic strain, then suddenly released his grasp, and was gone without another word or look, and I saw him disappear among the windings of the road beyond.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">AFTER-THOUGHTS-FLORENCE-PATRICIAN AND PLEBEIAN.</head> 
               <p>OVERCOME by my feelings, I stood for some time on the spot where Walter left me, absorbed in thought. Why must <emph>he</emph> suffer for my sake? I asked myself. Can I not consent to sacrifice myself for one so truly noble, so far above me in everything that is really generous and disinterested? Why could I not? The answer that came to my own consciousness made my blood tingle with very shame. Where was my pride,-my boasted independence? I was the slave of an infatuation,-an infatuation lightly regarded by its object, and coolly turned aside; an infatuation that my own judgment had never sanctioned.</p> 
               <p>Slowly and mechanically I turned to walk through the lonely avenue. Even the light of the stars was at this point shut out by the thick branches, but I felt no fears; the way was familiar,-these grand old trees had overarched my head on many an evening stroll; sturdy and full of years and dignity, they seemed to guard the patrician estate from the unseemly and unquiet outer world, yet they sheltered me, without one surly reminder that I was too plebeian to walk in their shadow. I felt grateful to the old trees, and as I looked about and thought of the luxury and refinement to which I had become accustomed, I wondered how I should feel to withdraw from all this and take my rightful place<pb n=""/> again. Walter and I had been born in the same sphere; I had been lifted out of mine to one of luxury and refinement, every want had been supplied, every taste gratified, till I had almost grown to think that wealth and ease and attendance were mine of right; he still remained in his, aided only by his own ambition, his own intelligent determination to raise himself from the obscurity in which he was born. Even to ourselves we had grown to seem as widely different as if separated by actual circumstances of birth.</p> 
               <p>This had been called my good fortune, this almost adoption into the family of kind Sir Robert; but I began to question whether it were so. I was unfitted for companionship with my own class, while this taint of plebeian blood that flowed through my veins prevented my being recognized as the equal of those with whom I associated, though training and culture had placed me on their level.</p> 
               <p>Lady Grace, who had given me every advantage with her own child, was unyielding in her prejudices of birth. She was supported in them by the dean and rector of the parish, who often favored the Hall with their presence. Their opinions on the matter were kept no secret from me; they could quote revered words and all the learned authorities in favor of the established order of things, proving with pious accuracy of quotation that "some were made to honor and some to dishonor." Did not our own poet say,-</p> 
               <q>
                  <lg type="quotation"> 
                     <l>"Order is Heaven's first law, and, that confessed,</l> 
                     <l>Some are and must be greater than the rest"?</l> 
                  </lg>
               </q> 
               <p>Thinking of all these things, I pursued my way, my heart goaded to bitterness, my mind tossed and distracted<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC5593-00000124"/> tracted by the anxiety and misery that seemed gathering around me; and I felt so sore about Walter, I suppose it was that made me so unthankful. As I reached the open lawn in front of the Hall, Helpo, the watchdog, came bounding toward me, licking my face and hands, and showing every mark of delight. Love is very humanizing; the great, shaggy fellow seemed like a friend come out to meet and call me back to myself. I caressed him, stroked his burly head, and called him the pet names he liked so well; and, soothed by the creature's demonstrations of affection, felt like myself once more as I entered the little side-door left unfastened for me by the housekeeper.</p> 
               <p>Poor Helpo whined and scratched at the door as he heard the bolt drawn. "Poor fellow!" I thought, "you have your troubles, too; and I suppose mine seem quite as unimportant to others as yours do to me."</p> 
               <p>I found Florence asleep, and would not disturb her; but knowing well that I could not rest, wrapped my shawl about me, and, throwing myself in the easy-chair by the bedside, continued my painful reflections.</p> 
               <p>But gradually they grew less painful. Was it being in such close proximity to that sweet spirit that had always had an influence on my harder nature, or was it that I had exhausted all the bitterness in me? Be it as it may, I soon fell into gentler musings. I saw the brighter side of life, I recognized the abundant gifts that had been bestowed upon me; could I not bear some inconvenience, some mortification even, for the benefits I had experienced,-the growth of mind, the expansion of my whole nature? Would I be willing to<pb n=""/> return whence I was taken for the sake of ridding myself of these keener sensibilities, these sometimes painful accompaniments of my elevation? No! rather let me suffer untold misery than pass through life unawakened, with darkened vision, with intelligence slumbering. Life and love were very beautiful,-more beautiful seen by the light of my changing mood than I had ever recognized them before. And as I gazed on the sleeping girl near me, I remembered with gratitude the love she had always shown me, and I thanked God that my ruder nature had been moulded by the silent teachings, the purity, the natural earnestness and truthfulness, of such a soul as hers.</p> 
               <p>Soothed and quieted, I must have fallen asleep, for I knew no more till I heard Florence saying,-</p> 
               <p>"You here, Olive? When did you get home?"</p> 
               <p>The sun was shining brightly in the room; I started up and hastened to remove all traces of the previous night's arrangement, and to dress for the morning. A bath soon restored me to freshness and vigor, and I was ready for breakfast, entertaining Florence, as we sipped our tea and toast, with an account of all that had transpired the previous evening.</p> 
               <p>She was delighted to hear about Tim. She always knew he was something wonderful, she said, with the eager interest which characterized her. And she asked about Mrs. Jamieson and her brother, and almost dropped a tear for the forsaken Mary, while she smiled at the description of the potent charms of Peggy.</p> 
               <p>At length I related what had passed between Walter and myself. She expressed much sympathy for him, for he was quite a favorite with her.</p> 
               <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC5593-00000125"/> 
               <p>"Of course you could not marry him, Olive; but still I feel keenly for his disappointment."</p> 
               <p>"And why could I not?" I replied, almost disposed to laugh at the gravity with which she made this decision. "What better am I than he?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Olive, do not talk in that way! It would be so strange, you know; like putting a thistle and a rose in a bouquet together,-like anything you can conceive of misplaced and extravagant. But you are only joking, I know. So let me hear the rest of your adventures."</p> 
               <p>Then retracing my story, I told her of Captain Fortescue's sudden entrance into the midst of the revelers, and how I had learned that he had a warrant for my father's arrest.</p> 
               <p>Florence was fired with indignation. "What!" she exclaimed, "are my countrymen to be hunted by these strangers like wild beasts? I would be a rebel myself; I would turn on them, the hirelings, and drive them from the land! Yes, I would. And were I Arthur-"</p> 
               <p>I saw that she was becoming too much excited, but at that moment Lady Grace came in.</p> 
               <p>"You look heated, my love; are you feverish?" she said.</p> 
               <p>"No, mamma; Olive and I have had such a pleasant talk. I suppose I had become unusually interested."</p> 
               <p>"You must be more prudent," said Lady Grace, looking at me, as I fancied, rather sternly; at least, I was exceedingly hurt altogether with her manner and words. "You have a very great responsibility in the present state of Florence's health."</p> 
               <p>And I felt that I had. Sometimes I would look at<pb n=""/> the frail girl with a sort of terror, as though she might pass from my sight like a snow-wreath; and again, perhaps in a few minutes, her glad smile and pleasant words would restore me to confidence, so that I would wonder what had made me afraid.</p> 
               <p>Ah, how little I knew of the working of slow, insidious disease! I had never had experience; and I was so strong and well myself, and every one around made so light of her illness. And certainly I thought she must be better; she did not have those distressing chills so often, and she was so cheerful and happy. Oh, she would soon be well again!</p> 
               <p>Then I had not the benefit of any judgment by those older and wiser than myself. Her father and mother saw her at her best, and she was so glad to see them, and so rejoiced while they remained, that they could not think of serious alarm. It was only one of those passing indispositions to which she had been subject from childhood, and the recent trial of her sensibilities, in the unfortunate affair with Major Trenchard, accounted for her unusual prostration. No physician made daily visits to the sick-room: Florence would not hear of it. She plead off from day to day. "I will soon be better; please wait a little while," was her plea.</p> 
               <p>But Lady Grace, this morning, was either unusually alarmed or unusually displeased with me.</p> 
               <p>"You must, Florence," she said, "have other care than Olive's about you,-one of more mature judgment. There is Adele; she has not much the advantage in years, certainly, but she has had more experience;" and, noticing a slight shade of uneasiness on<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC5593-00000126"/> the countenance of Florence, she added, "I do not, my dear, at all mean to supersede Olive, but only that you might have the pleasure of having both with you."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, mamma," said Florence, almost passionately, "it must not be so! I cannot have it so!"</p> 
               <p>"My dear, what does this mean? Do you object to having Adele with you?"</p> 
               <p>"I do,-I must, mamma."</p> 
               <p>"I hope, then, my child, that this is only one of those strange antipathies that sometimes come with illness, and will pass off. I trust, indeed, that it is so, and not the result"-looking severely at me-"not the result of mischievous misrepresentations."</p> 
               <p>Florence did not notice her mother's look; she said, brightly, "Oh, no, mamma; not at all. I am a little spoiled, you know, and just a little sick, and Olive is all I want."</p> 
               <p>"But Adele takes the deepest interest in you, my dear. She has long noticed the estrangement on your part, and it has almost broken her heart. Poor girl! she almost begged that you would see her; and she reminded me how you used to be playmates together."</p> 
               <p>"Why, yes, mamma; certainly Adele must come and see me. But-" And she stopped.</p> 
               <p>"But what, my dear?"</p> 
               <p>"She will not stay very long?" said the invalid, almost pleadingly.</p> 
               <p>"This is most strange,-unaccountable," muttered Lady Grace, as she turned away.</p> 
               <p>Poor Florence had another fit of sobbing, followed by utter prostration, after her mother left. I knew that these bitter tears were not for the trivial grief of<pb n=""/> to-day; but her mother's stern and unsympathizing manner had reopened the recently closed heart-sore. The nerves so lately shaken quivered at the lightest touch. I had not seen her weep in this way for a long time. I soothed her as best I could, endeavoring to woo her back to quiet and rest; but we never spoke of the real heart-grief which lay at the foundation of all this,-for the subject of Major Trenchard and his connection with herself was one on which Florence never entered; it was tacitly ignored between us after that final interview and parting. At length she lay back quiet and exhausted. A sudden fear seized me as I looked on her pale face. I could scarcely restrain myself. Must she die? I thought; she so young, so guileless, a victim to the foolish, hard-hearted vanity of a worldly and selfish woman? And in my heart of hearts I fear I cursed Adele as the cause of all this woe.</p> 
               <p>But an hour's perfect rest restored her. She smiled again, would rise and take her accustomed seat in the great arm-chair, and all went on pleasantly as of old, and I forgot my fears.</p> 
               <p>Early in the afternoon I was surprised by a message from Sir Robert, desiring my immediate presence in the library. Both Florence and myself made endless conjectures as to the meaning of this unusual summons, and it was with some trepidation that I proceeded to obey.</p> 
               <p>Entering the library, I found Arthur there, as well as his father. He was seated in the recess of a window reading, but, as I entered, arose, as though to leave the room.</p> 
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC5593-00000127"/> 
               <p>"Sit still, Arthur," said Sir Robert; "this is a matter concerning Olive that all of us are interested in. We all desire her happiness, and anything conducive to it cannot but give us pleasure. Take a chair, my dear. Sit still, Arthur."</p> 
               <p>I tried to speak, but could not; a trembling, a sickening agitation, overcame me. I must have betrayed my discomposure, for Arthur came to my side with a glass of water. Had he not been present, I should have felt calmer; but connecting the interview with my recent conversation with Walter, I supposed of course it was something in regard to him, and so I sat trembling.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, my girl," said Sir Robert, no doubt noticing my agitation, "I think you must have an inkling of what is coming! But to the point at once. Olive, I have this morning received for you a pressing offer of marriage."</p> 
               <p>"For me?" I faltered, while Arthur, apparently equally amazed, half started from his chair, but covered the action instantly by reaching forward to the bookshelves and taking down a volume.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, for you," said Sir Robert, amused at my consternation. "And what is there so wonderful in that? I, as your guardian, would be proud to have you accept. The gentleman making the offer"-it seemed to me the name never <emph>would</emph> come-"is Captain Fortescue."</p> 
               <p>The blood rushed to my face, and a strange sense of relief lightened my heart, as I repeated, "Captain Fortescue! It cannot be!"</p> 
               <p>"But it is. He has come honorably to me before he makes any attempt to gain your affections. He tells<pb n=""/> me he has loved you from the first moment he saw you-that is romance enough, even for you, is it not, Olive?-that he feels you are fitted to adorn any station, and that in consideration of your high merits, he is willing to overlook-to overlook-the-the-"</p> 
               <p>"The disadvantages of my humble birth," I suggested, with, I fear, somewhat too haughty a spirit, for I was weak enough at that moment to recall some of Adele's taunts, the smart of which had never been allayed.</p> 
               <p>"Well, Olive, we cannot but admit that the young man is generous and in earnest."</p> 
               <p>"For which I am truly obliged to him," I said, in softer tones, and much ashamed of my recent sharpness. "I feel it a great compliment, and Captain Fortescue has my profoundest gratitude."</p> 
               <p>"But I fear that will hardly satisfy him. What else have you to say? Speak freely, my child. You know one listens who has only your interest at heart."</p> 
               <p>"I know it! I know it!" I exclaimed, "dear, good guardian and friend!" The recollection of all his care and kindness rushed upon me at that moment and drove me from my moral stoicism. There was a long pause.</p> 
               <p>It was broken at length by Sir Robert, whose voice showed traces of deep feeling as he said,-</p> 
               <p>"I could wish that you might regard this matter favorably, Olive. He is a fine young man, this Captain Fortescue, of good character and rising fortune. His family are among the best."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Sir Robert, so exclusive," I replied, "they would hardly overlook the contamination such a union<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC5593-00000128"/> would bring on its fair name. And, Sir Robert, you have all spoiled me; you have so long made me your equal in everything, that I now find myself questioning the right of any to consider me an inferior."</p> 
               <p>"Bravo, my girl!" exclaimed the impetuous Sir Robert, clapping his hands with right good-will. "You have the real old Celtic blood,-no one shall trample on your rights. But this does not forward the suit of your friend. I'm pledged to do all I can for him. What say you: are you ready to become the Honorable Mrs. Fortescue?" Sir Robert could not easily forego his jest, even under the gravest circumstances.</p> 
               <p>"If Arthur would only take his eyes off me," I thought, "I could speak out freely;" but I felt their deep, penetrating power, though my own were studiously turned in another direction.</p> 
               <p>"I understand this maidenly diffidence," said Sir Robert, kindly; "but to me you can surely speak without hesitation. Shall it be yes, Olive?"</p> 
               <p>"No, I cannot say that," I answered, now with prompt decision. "No, Sir Robert, I can never marry Captain Fortescue. You will thank him, please, for this high compliment he has paid me. I feel it as such, and appreciate its worth; but he can never be other to me than a stranger."</p> 
               <p>"Why, Olive, this is high talk. Do not let your pride exaggerate this difficulty about family,-that will all pass off in time."</p> 
               <p>"But I have other reasons, Sir Robert."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, is that so?" said the baronet, smiling. "You are sure they are not fancies, Olive?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Yes," I said, excitedly; "the others may be fancies, <emph>these</emph> are reasons. He is the enemy of my country; he is here professedly to shed the blood of my countrymen; and more than that,"-I rose from my seat and approached the table,-"more than that, Sir Robert, he is even now pursuing my own father to the death."</p> 
               <p>"Your father!" repeated my listener, starting up from his chair.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, sir, my father; he has a warrant for his apprehension, and we all know, Sir Robert, what that means in these days."</p> 
               <p>"By heavens, this is too much! To what are they driving our unfortunate country! Will nothing but blood, blood, satisfy these infernal tyrants? But what can I do? I am tied hand and foot." (At least I knew that he thought so, and that the words of regret and sympathy were sincerely felt.)</p> 
               <p>He rose and paced the room with an air of deep perturbation.</p> 
               <p>"Do not fear, sir," I said, endeavoring to allay the storm I had roused; "my father is not taken yet, and they will have more trouble than they anticipate to do so."</p> 
               <p>This view of things seemed to relieve him. "True, Olive," he said, "very true; and we may be able to get him out of the country before these hounds get on the track. Now, Arthur, you can act in this; you know the country. But be careful, very careful, not to get yourself in any broils, or run in the teeth of established laws. We must manage these things as best we may."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE HIDING-PLACE.-THE FLIGHT FOR LIFE.</head> 
               <p>THIS was indeed a day to be remembered. At the appointed hour I was at the lower gate of the park, where Tim had promised to meet me. At first, in the darkness, I did not perceive him.</p> 
               <p>"Are you here, Tim?" I said, in some excitement; for if Tim had failed me, I knew no other means of reaching my father.</p> 
               <p>But his voice speedily reassured me. "We must lose no time, Miss Olive," he said. "We have far to go. Can you follow my quickstep without trouble?"</p> 
               <p>"To be sure I can, Tim; I am as nimble-footed as any. You need not ask a maiden who has traveled over the mountains of Wicklow, as I have, whether she can take the quickstep or not."</p> 
               <p>And off we started, on a kind of half-run, through many devious ways I had never seen before. Tim led and I followed. Sometimes the way grew so narrow that even one could scarcely pass, then it would widen to a broad plain, the wind making a clear sweep over it. But little was said: we were in too much haste. Sometimes Tim would give me a word of caution.</p> 
               <p>"Be careful there, Miss Olive; there is a steep precipice alongside this path." Sometimes there was a little stream to ford, and he would turn back to guide me over it.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"By gorry, Miss Olive, this <emph>is</emph> a hard road," was his sole comment; or, perhaps, a word of encouragement to me after this fashion:</p> 
               <p>"By jabers, ye're a brave young lady, Miss Olive!"</p> 
               <p>And on we struggled again, through scrub and brush, or toiling up some steep, precipitous path.-I certainly walking by faith, for in the dense shadow of rock and overhanging wood sight was of very little avail. Even when we reached the high levels, uncertain starlight, intercepted often by flying clouds, was all we had to guide our steps.</p> 
               <p>But I had full confidence in Tim; and on I went fearlessly, only careful not to delay our journey by an unwary stumble or fall. At last I began to feel the bracing air of the sea, to inhale the faint odor of seaweed and shell-fish, and soon I heard the roar of the incoming tide as it surged against the rocks girding the coast. Presently emerging through the cleft, we stood on the brow of a promontory stretching far out into ocean.</p> 
               <p>Tim gave a long, low whistle, which was instantly returned, and sliding rather than walking down the steep, sandy path, we reached the level beach below. A boat waited at the shore, hidden in a little cove overshadowed by the precipice we had just descended.</p> 
               <p>"Help the lady, my lads," said Tim, with quite the air of a master; and in a twinkling I found myself seated safely in the boat, which swiftly shot out from the shore. Nothing was said during this time; the men worked hard at the oars, and though the sea was rough, and the tide against us, we made considerable headway.</p> 
               <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC5593-00000130"/> 
               <p>We had proceeded thus about an hour, when, rounding a prominent headland, we entered a quiet little harbor, with what seemed to me a huge rock rising in its centre; a few strokes of the oar, however, revealed it to be a small island covered with ruins, which seemed the mouldering remains of some old monastery. This island was connected by a narrow causeway to the mainland. A sentinel was pacing the shore, his figure just distinguishable in the darkness; and as the boat neared we were challenged. Tim had the pass-word, and with a hearty response we were at once invited to land.</p> 
               <p>"Come on, my lads, and bring the young lady; it's a cold place to stand here. Tim, my boy, you know the way to the cave; take her there."</p> 
               <p>Scrambling through the loose, disjointed stones which lay scattered on every side,-passing through dismantled archways and long passages, open from above,-I followed my guide silently. At length we came to a halt, and, stooping down among what seemed to me a pile of rubbish, Tim said some words in Irish which I could not understand; but presently a trap-door opened, and I saw below a long flight of steps winding down in the darkness to what appeared a measureless depth. Tim descended, beckoning me to follow. With some trepidation, but with an unfaltering step, I obeyed. Only a coward would have yielded to misgiving after coming so far.</p> 
               <p>Before many minutes a sudden turn in the descent ushered us into a large cave, lighted by torches, where a number of men were busily at work putting handles to pikes, rubbing up old fire-arms, sharpening knives<pb n=""/> and swords. Lit by the flare of the torches, it seemed a scene in Pandemonium.</p> 
               <p>A feeling of terror came over me for a moment,-the flickering torches, the faces blackened with smoke, the busy, silent figures, presented so strange and wild a scene.</p> 
               <p>"Never fear, Miss Olive," said Tim, perceiving, as by instinct, my state of feeling; "they're all friends to ye. Any of them would die for ye this minute, miss."</p> 
               <p>A figure advanced from among the gnome-like band, a familiar voice greeted my ear, and my father clasped me in his arms.</p> 
               <p>Leading me toward his comrades, he said, "Boys, this is my daughter. Her heart beats as warm for us as though she had always been with us; it's in the blood, my boys. She's true as steel."</p> 
               <p>A cry of welcome arose: by no means a rough outburst such as might be supposed, but a cordial, almost tender greeting. There is a remarkable vein of sensibility even among the most untutored of these people, a rich warmth of human sympathy that almost allies them to genius. Had they but patience; the caution which avoids overt action; could they silently bear and forbear, success would be the result. But these qualities are lacking.</p> 
               <p>When the excitement of our first greeting was over, I saw that the countenance of my father was overshadowed by a deep melancholy.</p> 
               <p>"Are you not well?" I asked.</p> 
               <p>"Quite well, my child," was the brief answer, "but sick at heart. The anguish I have endured the past<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC5593-00000131"/> few days is almost more than I can bear; and but for the hope of revenge, the hope that I shall wipe out some of my wrongs in the blood of these dastardly villains, I could not endure it."</p> 
               <p>A wild, strange fire shone in his eye; an expression of malignity, fierce as that of some hunted tiger, changed his whole countenance.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, father!" I cried, and covered my eyes with my hand.</p> 
               <p>We sat upon a stone seat a little apart from the rest. The shadows lay all about us; the torchlight reddened the air. A lonely, solemn scene, down in the very heart of the earth, as it seemed; and this man, who sat beside me with a face of despair, was my father; frenzied, perhaps, driven out of his manhood by persecution.</p> 
               <p>"You will not wonder, Olive," he said, as if in reply to my thoughts,-"you will not wonder when you have heard it."</p> 
               <p>"Heard what, father?"</p> 
               <p>"It's a sad story, my girl, hardly fit for your ears; but I will tell it, so that if you ever hear some things that you may about your father, you will say that he could not help it; that everything that was left of him called for vengeance."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, father," I cried, "you used to be so wise and moderate."</p> 
               <p>"But I will be so no longer. What has it done for me, my girl?" he exclaimed, fiercely. "Did I not tell you they had taken my all,-my only subsistence,-hardly won by the toil of many years? I said it was my all; but I had my wife and child, my poor, little, sickly boy, that was to us like the tender veins of our<pb n=""/> hearts; but they grudged me even these. They are gone,-gone, Olive!"</p> 
               <p>And then he began a harrowing tale; telling it at first with a hardened stoicism, as of one who had exhausted grief; but, as he proceeded, the deep feelings of nature overcame him, sobs choked his utterance, and his frame shook with emotion.</p> 
               <p>"Say no more, father," I whispered. "I can guess the rest."</p> 
               <p>"Right, my girl. You might guess it from what you know of the disasters and degradation of us all. But <emph>this</emph>," he repeated, clinching his hand,-"<emph>this</emph> I doubt if you could conjecture, Olive. And you must know it; I want you to know it. Ask Tim to tell you, since I cannot; he knows the tale full well."</p> 
               <p>While this was passing between my father and myself, the men proceeded busily with their employment; but when his sobs broke forth, and for a moment he gave way to uncontrollable emotion, they all ceased working, and sat in silence, as though in respect for his grief.</p> 
               <p>"Father," I said, as he became somewhat composed, and I rose to take my departure, "of course you know that there is a body of soldiers out in search of you,-are you safe here?"</p> 
               <p>He smiled. "If not, there are other places in old Ireland that will shelter me yet," he said; "and as to being hunted, that is a game that two can play at. God does not always give the prey into the hands of the hunters."</p> 
               <p>"But, father, do you know that the priest, the monk who accompanied you to France, is a traitor,-is guiding them to your hiding-place?"</p> 
               <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC5593-00000132"/> 
               <p>"No, by heaven!" he exclaimed, with a start, "it cannot be. He is our friend; he was with us this very morning."</p> 
               <p>Then I told him all that I had noticed; and my father, much excited, communicated my suspicions to his comrades.</p> 
               <p>Some doubted; it could not be he would play them false with all his warm professions,-and he a priest, a holy father; surely it could not be. But others more penetrating had seen things they did not like about him; they prepared themselves with few words to escape his treachery, if possible, and to be ready for the worst.</p> 
               <p>I left with many forebodings.</p> 
               <p>Tim told me that we would return on horseback. He had a swift and strong little nag at the end of the causeway,-could I mount behind him? Would I trust myself with him? He would take me safely to the Hall in a much shorter time than by boat.</p> 
               <p>Of course I gladly accepted; and mounting without delay, we passed swiftly over the soft sand of the broad plain before us. The air was bracing and fresh from the sea; indeed, Tim told me that in times of violent storm this vast plain seemed itself a part of the ocean. It was now but a waste, covered as far as the eye could reach with the white sand of the beach, with here and there a stunted twig, or a heap of sea-weed left by the retreating tide. The night was clear and calm, the wind had fallen, and the solitary scene lay solemn in the starlight.</p> 
               <p>We were perhaps two-thirds of the way across this level when I heard a regular tramp, tramp, as of many feet.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"What is that?" I said, under my breath. "Tim, what is that?"</p> 
               <p>Tim listened.</p> 
               <p>"By gorry," he cried, "it's the red cut-throats!"</p> 
               <p>"After my father!" I exclaimed, my very heart standing still with terror.</p> 
               <p>Tim, quick-witted, and with all his faculties awake, prepared for the situation.</p> 
               <p>"They are full a mile off," he said, as he listened again. "I will drop you, Miss Olive, when we reach yonder clump of trees, and gallop back to the water-edge and give the alarm. They know my whistle,-the sentinel is always there,-and they will take to the boats in an instant. So don't be frightened, miss, they're all safe."</p> 
               <p>I insisted on dismounting at once. I could make for the trees myself, and would wait there till it was safe for him to return. All this was thought of and acted upon in an instant, Tim galloping off, while I hurried to the shelter of the trees.</p> 
               <p>The grove was a small one, ill-grown and scant of foliage. The high winds and sandy soil had left the trees stunted and starved, but they served an excellent purpose to-night; crouching down under their scrubby and twisted boughs, I could in my dark dress defy detection.</p> 
               <p>From my covert I could plainly hear Tim's shrill whistle, thrice repeated. This was a great relief; for he had told me that from the cave there was an opening to the sea where boats were always moored, so that with a few minutes' warning they could not fail of escape.</p> 
               <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC5593-00000133"/> 
               <p>Still I heard the tramp of men approaching nearer. The stillness of the night made every sound distinct. Had they not been so sure of their prey probably greater caution would have been observed; but I heard them descending the road along the hill, coming nearer and nearer; my heart beat high with excitement. Would my father get warning in time? Would the prey elude the hunter?</p> 
               <p>Nearer came the marching feet, nearer, nearer; they approached the low clump of trees where I was hidden; part going one side and part the other, they almost surrounded my little citadel; they passed on, the gown of the traitorous monk almost sweeping my face, and they were gone. I was safe, but how was it with my father? If by discovering myself I could at that instant have obtained a few moments' delay, I should almost have been tempted from my concealment. As it was, I could only wait in breathless anxiety the arrival of Tim. What if he should not come? What if they should get hold of him?</p> 
               <p>But this fear was of short duration. Very soon I heard his cautious whisper,-he had led the horse back. Mounting speedily, we were off fleet as the wind.</p> 
               <p>The spirit of adventure had quite inspired me, and now that I felt assured of my father's safety, I enjoyed our wild flight as if I were by natural inheritance an outlaw myself.</p> 
               <p>But I remembered my father's desire that Tim should relate his sad story to me, and as soon as we were safe from possible discovery, I asked my companion to tell me the tale.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>It seemed that about a week or ten days before my father's return an order had been given to search his cabin for arms. Such orders were common; the whole neighborhood of the poor knew what they meant, for on merest suspicion a body of soldiery would be sent, their commander oftentimes a mere lad, who, in the self-importance of a little brief authority, would destroy property, insult and punish, often apparently from mere wantonness. And for these things there was no redress.</p> 
               <p>Such an order had been given in regard to my father's poor home, and one of these reckless bands held it for execution. In the cabin they found only my step-mother lying ill, and my almost helpless young brother. The wife knew nothing of fire-arms, but the lad did, and with the characteristic truthfulness of his nature he would neither deny his knowledge nor tell them where they were concealed. He was faithful to the trust his father had reposed in him. Enraged by being baffled by a mere child, these inhuman wretches had seized the poor cripple and beaten him until he was nearly dead, his helpless mother witnessing the whole scene.</p> 
               <p>The men left, vowing vengeance on the lad should they ever meet him again. On my father's return from France there was another search by the same squad. Fortunately, he was away from his cabin. It was known that he had been there but recently, and they endeavored to obtain information from his son as to his place of concealment. Finding threats of no avail they repeated their former cruelty, and on the poor, weak body, scarcely yet recovered from their late<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC5593-00000134"/> brutal treatment, they laid the heavy lash again, until the half-murdered child lay in violent convulsions.</p> 
               <p>The poor mother was saved from this last sight; her weak spirit, so long trembling in its frail tenement, had mercifully taken flight when she beheld the agony of her child.</p> 
               <p>When night closed in, and my father ventured from his hiding-place and sought his home, he found his dead wife and dying child.</p> 
               <p>The boy smiled as he lifted him in his arms. "Oh, father!" he said, and his spirit passed away.</p> 
               <p>A terrible tale this; one that even now I shudder to repeat; but it is sadly true. My poor father! You did right to have me told all this, for now I can feel no surprise at the cry for vengeance, the bitterness of soul with which you looked upon the oppressors of your country, the murderers who despoiled your hearthstone.</p> 
               <p>The day was just breaking as we reached the park-gates, and with many tears over that dark tale, I thanked Tim for the opportunity he had given me of seeing my father.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">ARTHUR'S DEPARTURE.</head> 
               <p>MY first impulse on the next morning was to tell Florence all about my wild adventure; but on reflection I hesitated. Even my limited experience in such matters suggested that the excitement might harm her,-she was so thoroughly sympathetic, she would so enter into all my anxiety and alarm, that it would completely disturb the rest and quiet so needful to her recovery. So I refrained from speaking; and, although my heart was at times overwhelmed with sadness, endeavored to keep a cheerful countenance for her sake.</p> 
               <p>The damp and chill of winter was now disappearing under the bright influence of a warm April sun; tree and shrub and lawn grew freshly verdant; everywhere the stir and activity of spring made itself felt. Florence would have me place her chair by the window on the side of our sitting-room,-a large oriel-window reaching to the floor,-where a wide landscape of hill and dale was spread before us, bounded only by the heavy mists overhanging the ocean beyond.</p> 
               <p>A leading feature in the landscape of this portion of Ireland, our beautiful Wicklow, is its gracefully-undulating surface, every rise and depression being covered closely with the smooth emerald turf. It seemed to me that I had never seen the country so beautiful as now, so fresh and sparkling.</p> 
               <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC5593-00000135"/> 
               <p>"I feel so strong and well this morning," said Florence, "might we not have the window open a little while? And then will you bring the table, Olive, and all those things,-the paints and brushes and cardboard,-and let us finish the boxes and cases we have been so long about."</p> 
               <p>"Isn't it nice?" she added, with childish delight, as we settled ourselves to our work. And when I threw open the window, and the perfume of the violets, the soft scent from daisy and hawthorn-hedge filled the room, it seemed as though she could hardly contain her ecstasy.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, dear, how grateful I feel! Don't you, Olive? Such a wealth of sweetness and beauty everywhere; how good we ought to be for all this!"</p> 
               <p>We were quite silent for a few minutes, and then came a gentle tap at the door. "Come in," I said, and to our astonishment Arthur entered.</p> 
               <p>The pleasure which Florence exhibited on seeing him was unbounded. There were no reproofs that he had not come before, no upbraidings for his neglect. She thought wisely that she would enjoy the present to the utmost.</p> 
               <p>"And to have you with us, all to ourselves!" she exclaimed. "Now, come, bring a chair and sit close, and we will give you work. You can cut this card-board into all the shapes I show you. Oh, isn't it pleasant! It seems like old times again, doesn't it, Arthur?"</p> 
               <p>"It does," he answered, catching the spirit of the occasion; "and now let us forget that long time between, and let us be children once more. Come, where<pb n=""/> are the scissors? Let us go to work; I will spoil plenty of your card-board."</p> 
               <p>Florence now began to expostulate; with her usual earnestness, she took his remarks quite literally,-"But he must not." But he would. "She could not allow such wastefulness." Then she would take it from him, to be recaptured again by a high-handed manuvre; and so without any seeming effort the jangle of the boy and girl began, and they laughed at themselves that it was so.</p> 
               <p>When order was somewhat restored Arthur began, under proper instructions, to shape something as best he could. "A humble attempt at art," he suggested. There were squares and ovals, with various-shaped leaves to be made; but he was very awkward, quite untrainable, and there had to be explanation and expostulation, and for an hour we had as lively a time as could be imagined. We had indeed, as it were, forgotten "the long time between," and transported ourselves back to the days of childhood, where the present was all-important and vivid, and no thought of coming troubles clouded the light moment.</p> 
               <p>At first Arthur and I acted under a certain restraint; but Florence was so entirely abandoned to the joy of the moment, that unconsciously we became infected, and forgetting ourselves and personal feelings, we glided back together into the spirit of the old happy times.</p> 
               <p>"Arthur," said Florence, "do you remember how we used to sit round this table in the long winter evenings,-Olive and you and I,-studying our lessons for the next day, and how you would tease us when we were the busiest, by throwing all sorts of things on the<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC5593-00000136"/> page before us, and how vexed I would be, and poor Miss Lucas, too, and we would threaten to tell papa, and then you would laugh and beg to be allowed to escort us to his room? Do you remember all this, Arthur?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I do indeed remember it all, and much more," he answered, with studied emphasis.</p> 
               <p>"Well," she added, "I did not know but you might have forgotten it, as you never speak of those times."</p> 
               <p>"Forgotten!" he repeated, with a bitter laugh not pleasant to hear,-"forgotten! You do not know how I have tried to forget; but my memory is painfully tenacious, I can't do it, Florry."</p> 
               <p>This, I knew, was intended for me. "And why should you try to forget?" queried the unconscious Florence; "it is one of my greatest pleasures to remember;" and without waiting his answer, she added, "I do think it's your going away from home, Arthur, that has changed you so much."</p> 
               <p>"But I do not think I am changed," he replied; "others have changed,-I see that, I know that,-but I am the same as ever."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no, you are greatly mistaken. Olive and I have often talked it over, haven't we, Olive?"</p> 
               <p>This unexpected appeal covered me with confusion, which was not at all abated when Arthur turned quickly, and, looking at me with some severity, said, "And you too, Olive, have been dwelling upon my short-comings."</p> 
               <p>Seeing the altered and severe expression of his countenance, Florence supposed she had committed<pb n=""/> some great blunder, and, hastening to remedy the evil, interrupted him before I could reply.</p> 
               <p>"Oh," she said, "you need not be vexed with us, Arthur; we love you all the same, don't we, Olive? Oh, how often we have wished you had never gone away! You can't imagine how much we talk about you, and what a nice, dear, good fellow we think you are, you naughty, dear old brother."</p> 
               <p>"I suppose so," he said, somewhat mollified; "but what will you think of it when I tell you I am going away again? And it was to tell you this I came this morning."</p> 
               <p>"No, no!" cried Florence, "do not say so. You would not go away while I am ill, Arthur, and leave papa and mamma so lonely!"</p> 
               <p>He laughed. "Why, you make out quite a pitiful story. I cannot see that you are very sick, and I am sure Sir Robert and Lady Grace will be very far from lonely with all you here, and plenty of company beside; every day visitors are coming and going. I see you only want to persuade me into staying home."</p> 
               <p>A shade of thoughtfulness and perplexity, mingled with sadness, passed over the face of Florence. It was evident she wished to urge him to remain, but could urge no special reason why he should do so. She was silent.</p> 
               <p>He continued: "I suppose I ought to state my reasons to both you and Olive for going away at this particular time, when the country is in such an unsettled condition. I think when you have heard them you will agree with me that I am right in leaving. In the first place, it makes a fellow completely miserable<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC5593-00000137"/> to be doomed to inaction when everything urges him to action. I know that you girls are ardent patriots. I do not forget our many bursts of young enthusiasm,-how we vindicated Ireland from all wrong, how we vowed vengeance on her foes. Persecution always makes what we love doubly dear. I believe we were then heroic enough to enlist under any banner in her defense. We felt that she was wronged, though heaven knows we had little understanding of how or why."</p> 
               <p>"We understand it now," I said.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," he repeated, "we do understand it now only too well. I am no longer a boy, and could I act for myself solely, it would be less matter; but, unfortunately, I cannot. I involve the interest and reputation of an ancient and honored name, beside the distress of my own immediate family.</p> 
               <p>"My father knows to which side my sympathies lean, and he fears them more, I think, because his own naturally take the same course. He is afraid of himself and he is afraid of me. I see he is uneasy if I am out of his sight, and he dreads to have me speak, fearing I may give offense, or commit myself in some way.</p> 
               <p>"You know, Florence, our family have always been on the side of the government. It has always been a matter of pride with Sir Robert that this should be so, and yet we should retain the affection of those around us. If by any overt act (a thing which might occur, for one cannot always control their impetuosity),-but, if I <emph>should</emph> be so unfortunate as to compromise this established example and precedent which he has always delighted to follow, I verily believe it would break my<pb n=""/> father's heart. And so, as I cannot do anything to help, I had better get out of the way."</p> 
               <p>I was glad to hear Arthur speak thus. It accounted for much that in him had seemed weak and vacillating. Still, I could not but think it strange that so young a man should restrain himself so prudently. Walter was risking everything,-but then perhaps I ought to consider that Walter's actions involved no one but himself.</p> 
               <p>There was a pause. Florence, much agitated, watched her brother with earnest, loving eyes, but made no reply.</p> 
               <p>"I have talked with Mr. Massarene," he said, presently, "my old adviser. He says go. It is his opinion that a struggle is inevitable, and if it comes, as he fears, it will be ruinous. The policy of the government is to stimulate to a quick and sudden revolt. They are aware how wide-spread the dissatisfaction is, even among the most influential and law-abiding portions of the country; if they can provoke an uprising before any plans are matured they will do so. It is the poor peasantry that are most outraged by the present cruel exactions. They have little patience, less wisdom; if the government can drive them to open revolt, there will be an opportunity to crush rebellion at once and forever."</p> 
               <p>Florence wept bitterly. "Our poor, poor people!" she cried.</p> 
               <p>"But," said Arthur, speaking more cheerfully, "you need not accept this as a certainty because we wise-heads think it will be so. There is such a thing as being mistaken. Now tell me what you think of my<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC5593-00000138"/> taking a little trip somewhere,-say to Italy-or Jerusalem, or somewhere."</p> 
               <p>His sister laughed amid her tears.</p> 
               <p>"What shall I do, Florence?" he asked, pleasantly.</p> 
               <p>"You had better go," said Florence, slowly. "I do not think it is right to keep papa and mamma uneasy. But you will not go far?" she added, pitifully.</p> 
               <p>Why?"</p> 
               <p>"I might grow worse, you know."</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense! You have a fit of the blues this morning. I am not in the least afraid of your getting worse with that bright color on your cheek; and now that I have your royal permission, I beg to inform your majesty that I may be off to-morrow. Captain Fortescue talks of taking a run down to London, and I may accompany him."</p> 
               <p>"And what do you think of all this, Olive?" he asked, turning suddenly to me.</p> 
               <p>The words were so gently spoken, in the old familiar way, that for a moment I felt choked for utterance; at length I answered that I agreed with Florence, that he had better go.</p> 
               <p>"Well, you are very complimentary young ladies, to send me off in this way."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, we shall feel very badly after you are gone, Arthur," said Florence; "but you will write often to Olive and me, won't you,-just as you used to? I do not know how we could have lived without those letters."</p> 
               <p>"I will write to <emph>you</emph>," he answered, dryly, "and you can show the invaluable epistles to Olive, should she care to see them."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"How strange you are! To be sure she would."</p> 
               <p>At that moment Lady Grace entered the room, followed by Adele. They had been out for a drive. Her ladyship looked annoyed, perhaps at finding us together, and Adele was quite stately in her salutations. Lady Grace spoke first to Arthur.</p> 
               <p>"I understood you were to be in Dublin this morning," she said, with some asperity.</p> 
               <p>"I changed my mind, as you see," he answered, coolly.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, mamma," exclaimed Florence, "we have had such a pleasant morning! I suppose it was that kept him."</p> 
               <p>The cloud on her mother's face became still darker as, turning to me, she said, "I am surprised, Olive, that you should be so imprudent as to have this window open, and Florence sitting so near."</p> 
               <p>I started and colored with confusion; I had not really considered till that moment how imprudent it was.</p> 
               <p>"But, mamma, it was my doing,-I would have her raise it," Florence said, promptly, sympathizing with my distress.</p> 
               <p>Her mother did not seem to heed what was said, so resolved was she to find fault, and seemingly altogether with me.</p> 
               <p>Arthur now stepped forward, shutting down the window as he said, "Now it's all right."</p> 
               <p>"No, it is not all right," said her ladyship, in the same sharp tone; "the mischief is done, and if there is not more care taken in this sick-room, I will see what I can do to have it otherwise."</p> 
               <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC5593-00000139"/> 
               <p>"Oh, mamma!" said Florence.</p> 
               <p>I was utterly shocked and confounded. Had it been to save my life, I could not have spoken. Never had I heard anything like this from Lady Grace before; she seemed determined to mortify and humiliate me, and it was with difficulty I kept back my tears.</p> 
               <p>Arthur appeared to be much excited; he paced the room impatiently while her ladyship was speaking.</p> 
               <p>"Mother," he said, at length, "I cannot see why Olive should receive all the blame. Florence and myself are quite as much in fault." He strode out of the room, shutting the door after him with considerable violence.</p> 
               <p>His departure caused a lull in the storm; perhaps Lady Grace thought she had said quite enough. She now directed her attention to Florence, making many inquiries, admiring her work, and telling her whom she had called upon. There were the Misses Neville and many more who had begged to be permitted to see the invalid, "but I told them all they must wait a little longer, as I cannot have you disturbed, my dear."</p> 
               <p>"You are right, mamma; I am very well when Olive and I are alone,-but too many coming in make me feel very tired. I mean strangers, mamma."</p> 
               <p>"But you must not allow yourself to get morbid, Florence," was the mother's parting advice as she and Adele left the room. They had not much time to spend in the company of an invalid, for there was to be a large dinner-party at the Hall to-day. A number of friends were coming to say farewell to Arthur previous to his departure.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>When we were alone I gave way to my feelings, and had a "good crying spell." Florence coaxed and soothed me.</p> 
               <p>"It's all Adele," she said.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, now be fair, Florence," I answered. "Adele could not have had anything to do with this."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, she has. I have no doubt of it,-she had been talking to mamma before they came in. It isn't like mamma to act in this way."</p> 
               <p>That evening we had a note from Arthur, saying he would be with us in the morning to bid good-by. The tiny missive closed with love to the little girls, just as he used to write in old times.</p> 
               <p>"Isn't he a dear, good fellow?" said Florence, kissing the note.</p> 
               <p>We were early prepared for Arthur's coming. He entered with a light step and pleasant smile. "Now," said he, "the first sorrowful sound I hear, I will go right out of the room."</p> 
               <p>This was intended for Florence, whose eyes betrayed that she had been weeping.</p> 
               <p>"I do not know," she had said to me, "why I should be troubled, but I have such a feeling of clinging to him, as if I might never see him again if I let him go; I am so fanciful now, Olive."</p> 
               <p>"Mother and Adele," he said, "have gone in the carriage to morning service-I suppose to pray me through all imminent perils," he added, laughing. "They are to call for me on their return, to take me part of the way on my journey, at least to the post-station."</p> 
               <p>By this time Florence had recovered her smiles, and<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC5593-00000140"/> was busy arranging a basket of flowers from the conservatory. She was putting together a pretty bouquet for Arthur to take with him. He seated himself beside me, and began to assist in putting the rest in the vases waiting to receive them.</p> 
               <p>It was cordial and cozy, and for the moment it seemed as if nothing were wanting to our happiness.</p> 
               <p>"Oh," said Florence, suddenly, as she busied herself with her bouquet, "I forgot to tell you about Tim, Arthur. You remember that droll Tim, all tatters, we used to meet every now and then?"</p> 
               <p>"To be sure I do, and cannot soon forget the morning of the 'batin',' as he called it, when he rolled across the road, and I after him, thinking he must surely be dying, and then with a comical wink he said, 'It's only sport, young master!'"</p> 
               <p>"Well, you ought to see him now, Arthur. He is considered quite a genius. Mr. Massarene had him well instructed,-he can play on several instruments, and performs at musical entertainments in the city, and dresses like a gentleman."</p> 
               <p>"And I can answer for his music," I said, inadvertently; "he brings the sweetest notes from the flute, I ever heard."</p> 
               <p>I had scarcely uttered the words, however, when, with trembling, I thought of to what they might lead.</p> 
               <p>"And where did you learn all this, Florence?"</p> 
               <p>"Olive told me all about it. She saw him."</p> 
               <p>"Where?" said Arthur, turning to me.</p> 
               <p>The question was asked carelessly, but my miserable confusion gave it a meaning. I knew that my face was flushed with scarlet as he looked at me, but I was<pb n=""/> going to answer boldly, for why should I permit myself to be misunderstood so strangely?</p> 
               <p>But Florence hastily interrupted, "It is a secret, Arthur. Olive went with Walter to a party, and Tim was there." And noticing the dark look that came over the listener's face, she added, naively, "You need not be angry, Arthur, it is all right. It was only just for this once, on poor Walter's birthnight. He begged so hard, you know. He is such a good fellow!"</p> 
               <p>"Do not trouble yourself to give me any reasons. I care for none of your secrets!" was the angry reply, as, flinging the flowers from him, Arthur sprang to his feet, saying he must be off.</p> 
               <p>Of course all pleasure was at an end; Florence was heart-broken at this sudden leave-taking, but with her usual generosity she tried to console me. "He has grown so odd lately, Olive, but I know he loves you dearly for all, and he will get over this abrupt fashion after awhile and be like he used to be."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">TRIED AND CONVICTED.</head> 
               <p>LATE in the afternoon the carriage returned with the ladies. They had left Arthur at the post-station. Lady Grace observed to Florence in a whisper which I could not but think was intended for my ear also, that the parting between Arthur and Adele was quite trying.<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC5593-00000141"/> He had been moody all the way, and spoke but little, but when the moment of separation came, his fortitude forsook him.</p> 
               <p>"Poor Adele!" said her ladyship, aloud; "she wept all the way back."</p> 
               <p>"It would break my heart," said Florence, after her mother withdrew, "if Arthur should marry Adele. Oh, it would be dreadful! I cannot think, Olive, that papa likes her; indeed, I am persuaded he feels a little as I do. I do not think one need be ashamed of what seems almost like an instinct; there must be some good reason for it; and I cannot, I cannot endure her, Olive!"</p> 
               <p>I could have responded with all my heart to this feeling, but not wishing to excite her further, I said, gently, "We had better drop the unpleasant subject. The thing you speak of may never happen; and, at any rate, our fretting about it will not help the matter."</p> 
               <p>"True, Olive, I will try and forget it; only I want you to say, just once, it would be dreadful."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I will say it would be dreadful; I will say it once, I will say it a hundred times."</p> 
               <p>"That's right. Now I will do as you tell me, lie down and rest."</p> 
               <p>Holding my hand in hers she soon fell asleep, and I was left to my own thoughts.</p> 
               <p>How desolate I felt just then! There was no one to whom I could turn for a cheering word of support, no one to whisper in my ear that I might be wrong in these impatient repinings. I seemed left utterly to myself. I dared not speak to Florence, it would be wrong,-dangerously injudicious; and yet she was the<pb n=""/> only one who really knew me. Alas for these lonely wanderings, these inner desolations of the heart, that dare not ask for sympathy! to what depths of despair do they sometimes lead!</p> 
               <p>It seemed as if everything was conspiring to mortify, humiliate, and utterly crush me; and had it not been for the presence of Florence, whose love for me was my salvation, I almost felt at times as if I should have gone mad. This increasing severity of Lady Grace, those whispered words to Florence, stung me to the very soul.</p> 
               <p>Her ladyship had never made any demonstrations of attachment to me, neither did she to any, not even to her daughter. Still, through many years of uniform kindness I had learned to prize her esteem, and I had endeavored to make myself worthy of it. Perhaps I had rated myself too high, and in my ignorance had presumed and sometimes forgotten I was but Olive Lacey, a granddaughter of a servitor of the great house, a menial by birth. Then in my bitterness arose the question, Why was I lured to forget this? I had not sought it, I had not aspired beyond the lowly position in which I was born. Why was I forced to look upon an honest heritage as a disgrace? Why these educated tastes, these feelings made morbidly sensitive, if through them I was to be only wounded and trampled upon? I may have needed reproof, but to be reproved in this way and before others, and above all others before Adele and Arthur!</p> 
               <p>Thus I sat with my heart full of anger and anguish. I felt that I was unfair, knew that the exaggerated light in which I saw all things was the effect of my sore<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC5593-00000142"/> vexation; but I could not banish the feeling of disgrace and humiliation, I was so hurt, so utterly sore, with the recollection of what I had been made to suffer.</p> 
               <p>Very gradually had the change in Lady Grace's conduct toward me taken place. Yet for some time past I had felt, instinctively almost, that change. A something more imperative in the tone, a watchful glance of suspicion in the eye, an irritating manner to be felt but not put into words. It seemed as if some other mind than her own were secretly influencing her against me. Still, the indications were so slight they might after all originate in my own fancy; I had endeavored at least to persuade myself so.</p> 
               <p>But now there could be no mistake. As I thought the matter over, a new light dawned on my mind. Anger sometimes acts beneficially, like a physical storm clearing away dust, and dispelling the fogs that make mysteries of commonplace things. Lady Grace had, I felt certain, been brought to believe that I was aspiring to the honor of a closer relationship, that I was seeking to entangle the affections of her son. The distinction of being Lady Greyton was a thing not to be despised,-it would not be surprising if such a flattering fancy might dimly possess the soul of her dependent.</p> 
               <p>Bah! I sickened at the thought. In the intensity of my anger I could have gone to the proud lady and told her that I scorned such an alliance; that no high-sounding name nor lengthened lineage could atone for poorness of spirit and an inheritance of weakness. Yes, I could have done this, for at that moment my anger was as great against Arthur as against any one.<pb n=""/> Why did he treat me thus? make me the sport of his caprice, smile on me one moment, and cast me off as if I were the dust at his feet the next? Did he not know me well enough to throw off these miserable suspicions which I knew were rankling in his mind? Did he ever in those early days, when our intercourse was as free as air, know me to have a thought of untruthfulness or deception? Now I was misjudged, frowned at, watched as though I were some criminal. No, I would not bear it. I would speak out and let them all know I would not bear it.</p> 
               <p>At that moment Florence stirred and opened her eyes full on my face; still, I doubt not, impressed with my angry and unhappy mood.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Olive," she said, "what can be the matter? I never saw you look so excited before."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Florence, I never felt so-so angry, before. Perhaps that is the reason. I don't think I ever was so angry in my life. I have been abusing people and things in the most violent manner as I sat here."</p> 
               <p>"Dear me!" said Florence, sympathetically; and added, with much simplicity, "Has Adele been here?"</p> 
               <p>"Adele?" I repeated, astonished. "No; why do you ask?"</p> 
               <p>"Because I always feel in that way when she has been here."</p> 
               <p>Then we both laughed.</p> 
               <p>"Why," I said, "you make her out to be a most fearful ogre."</p> 
               <p>"Dear, dear, I hope not! I am always sorry when I feel in this hateful way, but I cannot help it. She<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC5593-00000143"/> seems to me to take the place of the evil fairy in our old fairy-tales,-something to keep my imagination astir with shivering and horror."</p> 
               <p>"But I must not allow this," she added, after a pause. "When I am strong I must reason myself out of all these whims. She is mamma's friend, and a great comfort to her. She may be Arthur's-" A deep sigh finished the sentence.</p> 
               <p>I often heard these sighs,-too often; they made me sad and heavy at heart. Then she would smile, seeing my sadness, something pleasant would be said, and the cloud, the foreboding, would pass away.</p> 
               <p>"But here is a note for you, Olive," she said, taking one from Letty, who had just entered with it. "It is from Walter," she added, glancing at the superscription as she handed it to me.</p> 
               <p>"From Walter!" I exclaimed, remembering the close of our last interview. "What can it mean?"</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps it is about your father," suggested Florence.</p> 
               <p>A sudden terror came over me. I took the note and went hastily to the window,-it was getting dusk. Within I read these words:</p> 
               <q>
                  <floatingText xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> 
                     <body > 
                        <div type="letter"> 
                           <p>"Your father is arrested. Come to me on the instant. You will find me alone on the conservatory-grounds.</p> 
                           <closer>
                              <signed>"WALTER."</signed>
                           </closer> 
                        </div> 
                     </body> 
                  </floatingText>
               </q> 
               <p>Stunned, scarce gathering the import of the words, I mechanically repeated them aloud to Florence. Her clear voice restored me to common sense.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Go at once," she said; "there must have been something very pressing to cause Walter to write in that way."</p> 
               <p>Without delay I obeyed. The night was gathering in shadow under tree and shrubbery as I hastened through the grounds, though a few faint, golden streaks still lingered on the spur of the mountain beyond. I found Walter at the place indicated; he met me frankly and cordially, as if nothing personal had ever passed between us. Even in my excitement and anxiety my heart thanked him for that highest courtesy. But there was nothing of the egotist in Walter; generous, unselfish, his was one of those rare natures which could forget itself in the desire to benefit others.</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry to have bad news for you, Olive," he said.</p> 
               <p>"I know," I replied.</p> 
               <p>"But I fear it is worse than you imagine-"</p> 
               <p>"Then let me know the worst," I interrupted.</p> 
               <p>"I would like to spare you if it were possible," he said, with kindly hesitation; "but there is no time to lose. I must come to the point at once."</p> 
               <p>"You need not fear for me; I am strong."</p> 
               <p>"Well, then, I have been in Dublin to-day, at the trial."</p> 
               <p>"The trial! Already?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; and the conviction."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Walter!" I gasped.</p> 
               <p>The terrible words rolled on me like a stone over a sepulchre; there was no air, there was no life; a faintness as of death overcame me.</p> 
               <p>"Olive," said Walter, softly; "I know you are a<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC5593-00000144"/> brave girl, Olive, but I have been too sudden. I feared to lose a moment."</p> 
               <p>He brought me a cup of water from a spring, seated me on a rustic seat under a tree near at hand, and presently, struggling against my weakness, I revived.</p> 
               <p>"Tell me all, quickly," I said, impatiently. "I can hear it all now. This was only a passing illness. Do not dally with words, or spare me one iota of the truth, Walter."</p> 
               <p>"A man's life is not worth much in these times," he said; "that is, if he is styled a rebel. A brief show of trial-perhaps a few hours-is followed by sure conviction, and the thing is over. Your father has been convicted of treason, on the testimony of that foreign priest we both disliked so much; sentence has been pronounced, and to-morrow he dies."</p> 
               <p>"Dies?" I repeated, wildly, scarce knowing what I said.</p> 
               <p>"Yes; that is justice, you know; justice swift and sure, such as we have meted out to us in these days. But I think we can save him,-myself and another. We will need your assistance, however."</p> 
               <p>"Tell me,-only tell me what to do."</p> 
               <p>"It is this: you shall go to Lord Castlereagh and plead for your father's life. Through him we can get a pardon."</p> 
               <p>"They say he is a hard man."</p> 
               <p>"Well, if you fail there, we have another hope."</p> 
               <p>The plan of operations as detailed briefly was this: In the first place, I was to request a line from Sir Robert, desiring Lord Castlereagh to admit me to an immediate audience on the following morning. If,<pb n=""/> being in Dublin and at the castle at the proper time, I failed in my intercession for my father's life, then I was to beg permission to see him for a few minutes in company with his confessor, who would be in attendance at the prison to which Walter would lead me, it being arranged that we should meet at a certain place not far from it.</p> 
               <p>Walter had made every arrangement for me. A horse and car were to be at the lower gate of the Hall at five o'clock on the following morning. I had only to obtain my credentials and trust in God for a happy result. "It will come out all right," said Walter, cheerfully; "only do not lose courage or temper if the boon you ask is refused, Olive. But earnestly, persistently, as only a daughter may, urge as a last request to have a few words with your father."</p> 
               <p>I readily obtained a note from Sir Robert, who was inexpressibly shocked when told of my father's misfortune.</p> 
               <p>"They are indeed a pack of bloodhounds up there," he said. "I think this will get you a hearing, Olive; and I hope, poor girl, that you may be successful." He handed me the letter with a pitying face, the kind expression of which touched me even to tears; yet I should not have expected further help from him because of that kindness. Action, decision, prompt assistance in time of need, were things that could not be demanded of Sir Robert.</p> 
               <p>"I have not mentioned that you are Richard Lacey's daughter," he added. "About that you may do as you please."</p> 
               <p>By daybreak I was on my way, and reached the<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC5593-00000145"/> capital before any of the public offices were open. But I had learned that his lordship gave private audience from eight o'clock in the morning until nine. Walter had enjoined it upon me to stop and rest for a few minutes and take some refreshment before seeking admittance, in order that I might be better able to accomplish all that I might be called upon to do. To be strong to pass the ordeal awaiting me I knew that I must attend to his suggestions, and I obeyed.</p> 
               <p>I found no difficulty in gaining admittance to the castle, and was at once shown to the apartments occupied as offices by Lord Castlereagh in his public capacity.</p> 
               <p>I was conducted to a small antechamber, where a number of others were, even at that early hour, waiting their turn for an interview.</p> 
               <p>A servant in livery carried in my note, and returned with the information that his lordship would see me in a few minutes.</p> 
               <p>Long, long minutes they were, dragging on slowly as hours. And how was it with those poor, waiting hearts around me? Their eager looks betrayed their anxiety at every sound,-the moving of a chair, a cough, a stir of foot, in that inner mysterious room.</p> 
               <p>My own heart beat as though its throbbing must be audible, and every nerve in my body vibrated as if shaken by an ague-fit.</p> 
               <p>Presently the door opened; every eye was strained, every ear attent. I felt a strange pity even in that supreme moment for their disappointment; their suspense would not be over as soon as mine. The servant came directly to me. I was the last arrival, but Sir<pb n=""/> Robert's wishes were of too much weight to be lightly thrown aside, and I was ushered into the presence of the great man.</p> 
               <p>As I entered and the door closed behind me, he rose from his chair in front of a table piled with documents, and said, with much cordiality, "My dear young lady, to what fortunate circumstance do I owe the pleasure of this visit?"</p> 
               <p>"My lord," I said, "I am in great distress. Will you help me? They say you have the power of life and death-"</p> 
               <p>I paused suddenly, overwhelmed with a terrible thought. I had been waiting so long,-hours, it seemed to me, had gone by,-perhaps at that very moment my father was being led to execution. I heard the click of a time-piece, but I dared not look.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, save him, my lord! save him!" I cried.</p> 
               <p>"Compose yourself, Miss Olive. Certainly I will do all that I can to help you. Who is it? Save whom?"</p> 
               <p>"Excuse me," I said, ashamed of my precipitation, "I did not intend to act in this way. My poor father-"</p> 
               <p>"Your father! Sir Robert! Is anything the matter? Ah! I remember; you are his ward. Your father?" He looked at me interrogatively.</p> 
               <p>"Richard Lacey," I replied; "he is condemned to death. Even now the time is drawing near."</p> 
               <p>"Richard Lacey your father!" repeated his lordship, with slow emphasis, as he drew himself up with stately dignity. I perceived with sudden anguish that I had thoroughly chilled the sympathies of this man by such<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC5593-00000146"/> an announcement. What trust in, what pity could he entertain for the daughter of such a person?</p> 
               <p>"I am deeply grieved, Miss Olive," he said, with a formality and precision contrasting painfully with his recent friendly manner; "but, but-ahem!-I cannot interfere. Higher duty than mere personal feeling must influence my action in affairs of this kind. Your father, pardon me, is a bad, a dangerous man,-an enemy to the true interests of his country. And as such, and all such, taking an extended view of the matter, must be removed for the benefit of the whole, the course of justice cannot be set aside, even when we most might desire it. In other words, we public men, bound to the interests of humanity, have public duties to perform to which we are obliged to sacrifice personal wishes. Therefore, painful though it is to me, I must decline all interference."</p> 
               <p>"But, my lord," I pleaded, endeavoring to retain my calmness, "my father is <emph>not</emph> a bad man; he has high and noble instincts. He has been driven from his peaceful, industrious life by oppression and poverty. Have pity on him! spare him, my lord, and he will leave the country if you will. Gratitude to you, my lord, will soften the bitterness of his resentment. He will not trouble you more. Oh, my lord, can you not, will you not, save this one poor, insignificant life? It is little to you; to me it is all things. Oh, God, have pity on my poor, poor father!"</p> 
               <p>Yet I felt that he to whom I spoke was steeled in his armor of cold official indifference. I could not reach him: my words fell idly; to him they had no meaning. As the daughter, or the well-born ward, of Sir Robert<pb n=""/> Greyton, they might have touched a cord of sympathy. But as the child of Richard Lacey, a rebel, a man who disturbed the established order of things, I had no power over the cool aristocrat.</p> 
               <p>"Then, my lord," I said, rising, and choking back my tears, "let me ask, as a last request, that you will allow me to see him. Give me a few minutes' private interview with him in company with his confessor, who has come for the purpose."</p> 
               <p>He considered a moment. "Certainly," he replied, at length, "you can see him. They will not deny you admittance at the jail. We do not intend to be unnecessarily severe; we only wish to be just."</p> 
               <p>"But let me have your direct permission; there may be delay; a line from you will carry me there at once; and oh, my lord, think," I cried, looking desperately at the time-piece, "there is but one hour and a half-" I shuddered; I could not finish the words.</p> 
               <p>He took pen and paper and wrote the permission, handing it to me, as, with his usual exactness and courtesy, he walked with me to the door of exit.</p> 
               <p>It may be supposed I did not linger long. Hastening from the castle, I followed the windings of some narrow streets and lanes, as Walter had directed, until I found myself on the borders of the Liffey.</p> 
               <p>Walter was awaiting me, with the priest of whom he had spoken.</p> 
               <p>"Have you good news?" asked Walter, as he hastened toward me.</p> 
               <p>I shook my head; I could not speak.</p> 
               <p>"Do not be disheartened, Olive; I expected this. But have you the permit?"</p> 
               <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC5593-00000147"/> 
               <p>I showed it him. "Then let us lose no time," he said, hastening on.</p> 
               <p>"Here is Newgate." He pointed to a large, gloomy pile, overshadowing the quarter as with the presence of crime and death.</p> 
               <p>I shuddered as I looked.</p> 
               <p>"Have courage," said Walter; "so much depends on your firmness, Olive." He whispered in my ear, "The turnkey is with us; he gave me the grip.<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="WRIGHT2-0073-NOTE001" n="*"

                     <p >A form of recognition between United Irishmen.</p>
                  </note> You know where to find me," and he left us.</p> 
               <p>Accompanied by the priest we entered the court-yard of the building, passing the sentinels,-the signature of "Castlereagh" to the permit giving us instant admission.</p> 
               <p>I had as yet taken little notice of the good father moving silently by my side. In truth, there was little to notice, his cloak or gown covering him completely, and the cowl being closely drawn over his face. Probably he was absorbed in devotion; but this assumption of sanctity was rather repulsive than attractive to me. I remembered that the treachery of one like him had betrayed my father. I sickened of the gloomy, winding passages, the stifling atmosphere of the old prison, and thought I could imagine the relief with which the doomed must walk forth, and breathe, though but for one short moment, the pure, fresh, outer air.</p> 
               <p>A low door in the wall opened to admit us, closing as we entered, and we were in my father's cell. In the dim light, my eyes, half-blinded by tears, could not for a moment discern anything. Something sat or kneeled in the farther corner, and before I could speak my<pb n=""/> father held me in his arms. "Olive, my girl," he exclaimed, "it is good of you to come and see the last of your poor father."</p> 
               <p>"Not a bit of it!" said the priest, abruptly, throwing off sundry wrappings and garments,-"not a bit of it! There's many a long day to come yet for Dick Lacey. Hurrah, my boy!"</p> 
               <p>My father and myself stood speechless, with hands uplifted, staring at the sudden apparition. There stood Tim, the identical old Tim, in all his original tatters.</p> 
               <p>I drew a long breath, I almost screamed, but a warning "whist!" silenced me. My father seemed utterly confounded, speaking not a word.</p> 
               <p>"Now, Miss Olive, we must act for him; there's not a minute to be lost," said Tim, picking up the cloak and cowl as preparing to put them on. "The good father must see you home, you know," he added, winking at me.</p> 
               <p>I woke to sudden comprehension. It was not upon himself, but upon the prisoner, that he adjusted the sacred garments.</p> 
               <p>"No, no!" said my father, endeavoring to throw them off. "No, no, Tim, I will not have it! No man must suffer for me."</p> 
               <p>"Lord bless ye, who'll suffer?" was the reply. "A few kicks, as they drive me out, will be all I'll get; and haven't I put on my old clothes for the occasion? Be off, man, I must to my prayers."</p> 
               <p>"May heaven forever bless you, Tim!" said I, fervently, as taking his hand in both mine, I raised it to my lips. At that moment the misshapen body, clothed<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC5593-00000148"/> in tatters, seemed to enclose an angel whom I could have knelt to and worshiped.</p> 
               <p>My father still hesitated. "Tim," he said, "I cannot do it. It is unmanly to leave you here."</p> 
               <p>"Now be off," returned the other, "and I'll meet ye at the Three Points to-morrow, you know."</p> 
               <p>Tim's priestly disguise had been cunningly arranged, a false face under the enshrouding cowl rendering the pretended priest apparently about the height of my father, and the cloak entirely covering his crippled limbs and limping gait. When the prisoner was at length arrayed in this drapery, I should not have known him from the good father who entered with me.</p> 
               <p>It may be supposed that after we had walked from the prison with the slow step and downcast air befitting those absorbed in grief, we were not very tardy in our motions. Once or twice my father gave a sigh as we hastened on, but we did not stop to exchange a word.</p> 
               <p>I remembered distinctly all Walter's directions, and, we were soon on the outskirts of the city, when hastening along an unfrequented road, we found Walter behind a little hillock, waiting with the car.</p> 
               <p>"So anxious I have been," was all he said, as, helping me in, my father and himself quickly following, he bade the driver whip up the horses.</p> 
               <p>Not a word was spoken for some time as we galloped along; we could hardly breathe in our anxiety to be safe beyond the precincts of the city.</p> 
               <p>The distant bells rang the noonday. "Oh, my God!" exclaimed my father, covering his face with his hands, "and I still live!" His strong frame shook with emotion.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"What shall I do for all this, Walter? You have saved me from a fearful doom; may Heaven bless you, my friend!" And he laid his head upon the young man's shoulder, shedding tears of love and joy and thankfulness; in truth, we wept together.</p> 
               <p>Walter's cheerful voice was the first to be heard.</p> 
               <p>"Why," said he, "this is nothing but what we all are ready to do for each other. Tim was the first to make the suggestion. Isn't he a noble lad?"</p> 
               <p>To this we all assented.</p> 
               <p>"I am glad I did not know it was Tim," I said, "when I asked permission for him to accompany me to the jail, and as I walked along with him; I should have felt nervous and anxious, and could not have done it so well."</p> 
               <p>"We thought it likely," said Walter, "and so kept it to ourselves."</p> 
               <p>"I hope no harm will come to him," said my father. "Life is a good thing, but-"</p> 
               <p>"But what, father?"</p> 
               <p>"But," he added, "I hope no harm will come to Tim."</p> 
               <p>"Never fear," said Walter, laughing, "he'll come out all right; he knows well how to play his part."</p> 
               <p>It was necessary, in order to avoid the main road, to put me down about two miles from the Hall, which distance I was obliged to walk. Utterly weary, yet with light heart, I at length reached home, and found Florence delighted to see me.</p> 
               <p>"I am <emph>so</emph> glad you are back," she said; "I have been miserable all day without you. Mamma is very kind, but it frets me to feel myself an invalid; and<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC5593-00000149"/> Adele has been here, but I did not say a word of where you had gone. So you must reward my patience by telling me all."</p> 
               <p>And I did tell her all, even while trembling lest the excitement of the narrative might injure her. But I think it rather did her good, giving her great, warm heart a joy that for a time invigorated and strengthened even her frail body.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">AFTERWARD.</head> 
               <p>I HAD not given a thought to the consequences that might follow my active participation in my father's escape. Had I done so, it would have made no difference in my action, my absorbing thought being to save him from a terrible death, and I should have taken any risk to accomplish that end.</p> 
               <p>My poor father, from his humble condition unknown, uncared for, outside of his own limited circle, might have walked to the gallows and laid down his life (a life imbued with the purest patriotism, and dear to him as life is to any), and in an hour it would have been forgotten that he ever existed. But now a widespread notoriety was likely to attend him. By this act of defiance to the government he had risen to supreme consequence; such audacity must be punished in the severest and most public manner. What right had he to live when a powerful government had bidden him<pb n=""/> die? To plan an escape in the very face of jealous and watchful authorities, to set an example of defiance of government officials, were things not to be tolerated or dealt with lightly. Large rewards were therefore offered for his apprehension, either dead or alive, and bands of military were ordered out to scour the country in every direction to hunt down the rebel, while those who had aided in his escape were threatened with the severest penalties.</p> 
               <p>Of course Florence and I, in our quiet little apartment, knew nothing as yet of what awaited. On the evening of my return we had retired early, slept soundly, with a serene unconsciousness of coming trouble. The next day, however, I felt the effect of my recent excitement. I rose feeling weary and almost ill. Florence, noticing my extreme paleness, urged me to go out and get the air, while she turned over for another nap. That, she said, brightly, would give me an appetite for my breakfast.</p> 
               <p>I was glad enough to obey. The fresh morning air, the breeze that swept through the silent paths, was reviving. The garden breathed only sweets; its atmosphere was laden with the delicious scent of early flowers and hedgerows. My spirits rose; an inspiration, a youthful lightness of heart, such as I had not known in a long time, took possession of me. Vexation, jealousy, all mental malady, seemed to drop with my bodily illness. I seemed to have risen to a new life, so loving, so forgiving, so at peace did I feel. My father was free, and I had helped to free him. I had done something. I was no longer a mere drone. I had participated in those stirring events, those exciting scenes of danger,<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC5593-00000150"/> which kept the times athrill. That which had moved my heart ever since childhood to love for race and country was now not a thing merely to dream over, it was a part of my actual knowledge and experience.</p> 
               <p>Thus in a pleasant reverie I wandered on amid the blooming flower-beds and through the fanciful maze of winding paths which threaded them, until I came to that well-known door in the old wall, through which, in the dear old times, Florence and Arthur and myself had so often passed in childish glee to our favorite range in the wild, deep gorge below. I hardly stopped to account for my unusual exhilaration of spirit. Youth does not often spend itself in reflection on the causes of its changing moods. Enough for me that I had been miserable, and that I was again in joyous good spirits. In this state of mind I was ill prepared for what followed.</p> 
               <p>Lingering in the ravine longer than I had intended, I suddenly bethought myself that breakfast might be waiting, and turned to take the short path through the kitchen-garden, which led to the back of the house. I had not gone far when I was startled to observe a number of persons grouped behind a clump of tall bushes, as if in secret conclave. As I came nearer I recognized some of the servants from the Hall, and one or two of the laborers about the grounds. Conspicuous among them in his plush small-clothes and scarlet vest was Jenks, the butler. They were so busy talking in a half-whisper that I was almost on them before they noticed my approach.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Miss Olive!" they all broke forth as they saw me.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"What can be the matter?" I asked in some alarm.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Lord help ye, dear!" "Oh, musha!" "Oh, that I should ever see this day!" was all the reply I could get, in various tones of distress, as the maids and matrons of the household closed around me, until Jenks, assuming his proper authority, commanded silence while he explained to the young lady.</p> 
               <p>The explanation was this: There was a body of soldiers on the place with a search-warrant.</p> 
               <p>"And to take ye to jail too, Miss Olive!" cried an irrepressible voice from among the women.</p> 
               <p>"And my lady is in fits," said another, impatient at the slow process of explanation.</p> 
               <p>I did not know but Jenks would lay violent hands on these unruly spirits.</p> 
               <p>"Silly, lying jades, will ye hould yer pace? Take yese to jail!" he exclaimed; "there's nothing in it, my young lady. But, Miss Olive," he added, in a whisper, "if there's any trouble, send them to me. I'll swear ye through. Were ye not at home all the day? I saw ye here in the morning and in the afternoon, and sure ye couldn't be in Dublin and do all they say you did between them times. But I fear it'll go hard with Mr. Walter."</p> 
               <p>"To be sure it will," cried one of the men, an under-gardener leaning on his spade at the outskirts of the group, who caught the last words; "they'll hang him if they catch him; but, bedad, they'll find it hard to do that."</p> 
               <p>Here some of the tender-hearted girls broke into sobs, which changed to a frightened general scream, and huddling together, as through the wire gates of<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC5593-00000151"/> the garden wall a body of soldiery were seen marching, preceded by an officer in full uniform.</p> 
               <p>A few minutes more and the butler's bell rang loudly; the servants quickly dispersed, leaving me alone. I was about to follow when Jenks returned, saying Sir Robert wished to see me in the library. "Keep a good heart, miss," were his last words, as I hastened to obey the summons; "I'll swear ye through."</p> 
               <p>Of course there was great indignation on one side, and great excitement on the other, as the news got abroad of the escape of a state prisoner, one convicted and about to be executed. The wildest stories were circulated. Some had it that the prisoner was a foreign prince in disguise, and that a daughter of one of the noblest houses had planned his escape and eloped with him; others intimated that he had been secretly made away with to avoid the indignation of the people. These tales I heard afterward. But now, with all my attempts to fortify myself with the martyr-spirit, I could not help a certain flutter of dread when I considered that I was about being brought to account for what I had done.</p> 
               <p>With Sir Robert I found two gentlemen, one the military officer whom I had seen, the other, from his dress, I judged to be a civil official. Neither of them looked very formidable. As I entered they rose courteously, while Sir Robert, wearing his old pleasant expression, said, "Ah, my girl, you have got me into a nice scrape; brought rebellion into my very family, eh?"</p> 
               <p>"I am very sorry, Sir Robert," I said, earnestly;<pb n=""/> for it now came to me in full force that I had probably greatly compromised this good friend by my acts. "Sorry, indeed, that I should have given you any trouble in this matter; and if there is anything I can do, even to laying down my life, I will do it,-I will do it," I repeated; but I could not get any further: tears choked my utterance. This kind reception by one whom I had deceived, and perhaps injured, filled me with emotion, for I had always loved Sir Robert as a father.</p> 
               <p>"Well, well," he said, using his handkerchief with some energy, "never mind, Olive; you're a good girl,-you did not mean any harm; and, after all, there's not much harm done. These gentlemen do not doubt my loyalty."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly not, Sir Robert; neither is it doubted anywhere," was the response.</p> 
               <p>"And all that will be required, my little rebel," he continued, "is that you keep under my surveillance for a time, as I am your bondsman, so that I can produce you whenever needed. And, gentlemen," he added, "after all, we cannot be very hard on a young girl, when we consider it was her own father she helped to rescue."</p> 
               <p>The strangers raised their eyes in polite astonishment. "The young lady is not your daughter, Sir Robert?"</p> 
               <p>"No, not my own,-my adopted daughter,-but just as dear to me."</p> 
               <p>I was about to leave the room, when the gentleman in citizen's dress asked courteously if he might put a few questions to me.</p> 
               <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC5593-00000152"/> 
               <p>To this there could, of course, be no objection; and immediately addressing me, he inquired when and where I had last seen this escaped criminal, Richard Lacey.</p> 
               <p>"You need not answer unless you are perfectly willing, my child," said Sir Robert.</p> 
               <p>There was a peculiar tenderness of tone in his voice all through this interview that touched my feelings most acutely.</p> 
               <p>I thought a moment. My father was now, no doubt, far away; my reply could make no difference. I answered, steadily, that I had last seen my father on the afternoon of the day previous, and had left him on the high-road, about two miles from the Hall.</p> 
               <p>"Which way was he going?"</p> 
               <p>"That I decline to answer."</p> 
               <p>"Was he alone?"</p> 
               <p>"No."</p> 
               <p>"And who was with him?"</p> 
               <p>"That I also decline to say."</p> 
               <p>"Have you no idea as to whither they were bound?"</p> 
               <p>"None, sir," I replied, promptly and truly, for not one word on the subject had been uttered while I was with my father. Excitement and joy at the release had occupied my mind to the exclusion of any thoughts on the subject of his future.</p> 
               <p>My interlocutors seemed satisfied, and Sir Robert intimated that I might withdraw, adding a caution against exciting Florence by recounting what had taken place.</p> 
               <p>This was a most pleasant termination to an unpleasant affair, and I began to think my troubles were<pb n=""/> all over. But, alas! I soon found my mistake, and that there were other and graver difficulties to surmount.</p> 
               <p>Lady Grace was a very different person from Sir Robert, and, beside,-how could I doubt it?-she had one at her elbow to fan her displeasure to a hotter flame. She had conceived an idea that the family were deeply disgraced by my proceeding. The exaggerated reports afloat had reached her ears, and the idea that the family name should be bandied in every common mouth was intolerable to her aristocratic nature. And that any whom she had fostered should place themselves in defiance of constituted authority, was, in her eyes, to be irredeemably degraded, be their cause right or wrong, and as such they were the recipients of her unalterable displeasure.</p> 
               <p>A few minutes after I had seated myself beside Florence, I was summoned to her ladyship's chamber.</p> 
               <p>"I hope mamma is not going to scold you," said Florence, "for being away yesterday. I knew she was vexed; but you must tell her I wanted you to go."</p> 
               <p>I laughed, and answered, "I am not frightened."</p> 
               <p>I have sometimes thought that, in adopting an opinion or considering a wrong, women are less flexible, less open to conviction, less forgiving than men, at least I found it so with Lady Grace. She had judged me, and any attempt to justify myself was not to be heard.</p> 
               <p>I was to leave the house I had disgraced.</p> 
               <p>"But, Lady Grace-"</p> 
               <p>"I wish to hear nothing more," said the autocrat, who lay extended on her silken sofa; "you see the state to which I am reduced."</p> 
               <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC5593-00000153"/> 
               <p>"Which makes me venture to entreat, Miss Olive," interposed the ready Adele, as she hastened to sprinkle some reviving perfume on her ladyship's forehead and hands, "that you will not press this subject any further. You see how prostrated our dear friend is. Dear Lady Grace, be calm," she continued in a transport of renewed tenderness, clasping the listless hands. "Olive will not distress you any more; I know she could not be so cruel!"</p> 
               <p>Cruel! I was bewildered. <emph>I</emph> cruel to my benefactress! Even then I could have gone down on my knees, wrong though I felt she was, and asked her forgiveness, and begged to be restored to love and kindness again; but I could not speak before that girl. She had the power always to excite the worst that was in me: my pride rose unconquerable, my heart felt as a stone. I left the room filled with bitter resolves.</p> 
               <p>Yes, I would leave the house-and on that very instant. But then I must also part with Florence, my heart's treasure, my love, my darling. The pang that came with this thought was so sharp, so severe, that I could not restrain a cry of anguish as I pressed my hand upon my heart.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. O'Neil, the housekeeper, heard the sharp sound of anguish, I suppose. She opened the door of her little room and said, in her kind, motherly way,-</p> 
               <p>"Come in, my dear."</p> 
               <p>She comprehended all my misery, and, with quick womanly sympathy, endeavored to ease my heart. "You had better do as her ladyship says for awhile, dear; it'll not be for long; it's all because of Miss Adele. I've seen it coming for some time, but it will<pb n=""/> all end right, never fear. The bad cannot always prosper, blessed be God; so, dear, don't take on so, it will soon come straight."</p> 
               <p>These kind words did comfort me, even though they could not reach the heart-sickening wound that I had received. She said no more, letting me weep in silence till the passion of grief was over.</p> 
               <p>When I returned to Florence, although I had made every effort to obliterate any sign of tears or emotion from my countenance, she at once perceived that something was the matter.</p> 
               <p>"Is it Adele?" she said. "Has she been telling mamma some stories again? Oh, poor mamma is so sadly deceived! Did she know Adele as we do, Olive, how different it would all be! But who can make her understand it? She would think it all unreasonable dislike if we attempted to do so."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said I, recalling the rigid and unforgiving aspect with which Lady Grace had last received me; "silence is all that is expected of us."</p> 
               <p>"Do you think it wrong to feel an instinctive shuddering dislike like this,-an antipathy, Olive?"</p> 
               <p>"No more than I would to dislike a noxious reptile," I answered, briefly, and with bitterness.</p> 
               <p>"And mamma,-Adele seems to have made herself so necessary to mamma's comfort,-and she has so many projects in the future for Arthur and Adele."</p> 
               <p>These words were torture to me; I knew it all to be true, but I could not bear to hear it spoken. "Now, dear," I said in my misery, "you know we resolved that we would not talk about Adele. Let me read to you; I am sick and weary."</p> 
               <pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC5593-00000154"/> 
               <p>"And I am sick, too," said Florence; "I had such a weary day yesterday. You must not leave me again, Olive. Yes, read; do read me something pleasant."</p> 
               <p>I reached for my book and sat down by the bedside, turning my face away from her, for it required all my efforts to hide my tears. The thought would keep uppermost, "I must presently leave her forever."</p> 
               <p>As I turned the pages the door opened and Sir Robert entered. It was an unusual thing for him to pay us a morning visit.</p> 
               <p>"What!" said he, "not up yet?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, papa, I am a little tired, and maybe lazy, this morning. I ought to be up, I know; but I am so glad to see you, dear, sweet papa! And they say poor old Sappho is dead at last. Won't you sit down and tell me all about it?"</p> 
               <p>I gave my chair to Sir Robert, and he sat down and began to talk to Florence in his gay, pleasant way. Gradually, however, he approached the real object of his visit, which was to insist that she should see the family physician. An animated debate followed, for Florence had always manifested an unconquerable aversion to being considered a bona fide invalid. She submitted at last to her father's wishes with a smile and a sigh.</p> 
               <p>I seized this opportunity to slip away. I could not bear the thought of a formal departure, and of saying good-by to Florence,-that would break my heart. While she was busy and happy I would go, and hide my mortification and misery in my grandmother's little cottage.</p> 
               <p>My garden-hat lay upon the chair by the door, and,<pb n=""/> picking it up, I glided outside. In the passage-way I met Letty. I threw my arms about her in a transport of grief which astonished the girl beyond measure.</p> 
               <p>"Take good care of your mistress, Letty," was all I could say.</p> 
               <p>Reaching the lodge, I found everything silent. The place looked deserted. Opening the door into the little parlor, I entered. There was no one there. I proceeded up to my grandmother's room, where I found her fast asleep on the bed. She did not waken on my entrance, and I softly retreated and went to seek Betty, the maid of all work, who, busy in the kitchen, had not heard my entrance.</p> 
               <p>From her I learned that my grandmother had been very poorly the day before, that she sometimes heard her moaning, as if in distress; that she had wanted to go up to the Hall for me, but the old lady would not let her, saying she should be better soon. And this morning she had not stirred, but kept on sleeping so sweetly.</p> 
               <p>I returned to the bedroom, and sat down quietly, to await my grandmother's waking. I was glad of a little respite, for I did not know how to tell her what had happened. I knew that her inquiries would be very sharp if I remained over the usual time, and how should I acknowledge "I have left the Hall forever?" Indeed, I had turned it over in my mind if it were possible for me to seek some other place of refuge rather than tell her all. To her now my father was doubtless a name forbidden,-she had no pity for or sympathy with rebels,-and whatever befell him hereafter would be looked upon in the light of a just punishment. I felt that she<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC5593-00000155"/> might be as severe as Lady Grace, perhaps she would even refuse me shelter, if I so lowered myself in her eyes as to relate all that had transpired of late. Yes, I was glad of a little rest, a little time to think, for I seemed as yet to have been acting in a dream.</p> 
               <p>Still she slept; it was now past midday. Betty crept in softly.</p> 
               <p>"And does the mistress still sleep, an' the sun glarin' in this way! It isn't like her; musha, dear, hadn't we better waken her up?"</p> 
               <p>This was the first I thought of alarm. It had not occurred to me that this sleep, so prolonged, so undisturbed, was other than natural. I bent over the bed and looked into the face of the sleeper. There was a little color there, and the hands as I touched them felt soft and warm . The sleep seemed to me like the sleep of an infant.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Betty, why did you frighten me?" I said; "grandmother couldn't be sick and sleep so sweetly."</p> 
               <p>"Sorra me, an' bad luck, dear, to any would harm ye; but old people are like babies, they may sleep their life away."</p> 
               <p>At that moment, perhaps roused by our whispering or the motion of my hand, my grandmother suddenly opened her eyes and looked keenly at me.</p> 
               <p>"You here, child!" she said; "you have been long away."</p> 
               <p>"Me, grandmother? Oh, no!"</p> 
               <p>"What! it's you, Olive? I thought it was-Yes, poor child! but where's your color gone? You look white as she did when I last saw her,-very white-very white."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>And again she slept.</p> 
               <p>Hours went by in a strange, hushed quiet. Occasionally the old lady would waken. She always knew me and would have a word to say,-</p> 
               <p>"Don't stay too long, dear. Walter will see you to the Hall," or something of the sort.</p> 
               <p>I offered her drink, but she refused it. She seemed to have some difficulty in swallowing; once or twice I persuaded her to take a few drops of wine, and I moistened her lips with water occasionally; still, sleep seemed to be all she desired.</p> 
               <p>Thus the afternoon wore away. Late in the evening my grandmother rested so calmly, and breathed so sweetly, that I could not think she was seriously ill. We fastened the doors and windows, and I bade Betty go to her room. Before she left, however, she came close to me and whispered, "Miss Olive, can ye tell me where Mr. Walter's gone? It's not like him to be away so long. If the ould mistress was herself, she wouldn't like it."</p> 
               <p>I assured her he was not far away, he would soon return, and she left contented. I sat up some time longer, but at length, weary with watching and thinking, threw myself across the foot of the bed.</p> 
               <p>I must have fallen into a deep sleep, for I had no recollection of anything more until something-a peculiar sound, as of heavy breathing-startled me, and I woke to find it broad daylight.</p> 
               <p>Being so suddenly awakened, I was stupefied for a moment, but again I heard that ominous sound. Springing from the bed, I called aloud for Betty. She came in a moment; we rubbed the stiffening hands, we<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC5593-00000156"/> bathed the cold face, but, alas! in vain. The grim messenger was there, the gathering shadows closed about the vanishing spirit; a sigh, and she was gone.</p> 
               <p>I could not restrain a wild outcry. "Dead! my grandmother dead, and I asleep! Oh, perhaps she had some last words to say! perhaps she may have called and I did not hear!"</p> 
               <p>Betty, more used to death than I, wasted no time in regrets. She attended to all the proper decencies, straightened the limbs, closed the eyes, and the calm face of the dead looked as though again composed to quiet slumber.</p> 
               <p>What now was I to do? Where should I get help? I thought of Lady Betty, but, alas! she was as dead to me. All those whom I had leaned upon were gone. Should I send for Mrs. O'Neil? She was always good, but perhaps now she felt as the others did. I looked up from the bed where I had leaned my head in sobbing despair, and there stood Mrs. O'Neil.</p> 
               <p>She had come on another errand, although willing to stay and do all she could in the strange emergency which had befallen. Miss Florence was very bad,-I must go to her at once.</p> 
               <p>And then I learned that Florence had been put off with many excuses for my absence, but when I failed to return at night her suspicions were roused, and they were obliged to tell her all. She refused to be comforted, she was utterly distracted, and Sir Robert, who then for the first time heard the particulars of my departure, was indignant beyond measure. Florence had passed a fearful night, and Lady Grace had herself called Mrs. O'Neil thus early to carry a note to me, in<pb n=""/> which she asked, even entreated, that I would return to her suffering child.</p> 
               <p>I did not linger,-scarcely did I finish reading her ladyship's note. And in a few minutes Florence, with her arms tightly wound about my neck, as if to keep me from ever again leaving her, was sobbing upon my breast.</p> 
               <p>"My God! to part these two!" said Sir Robert, turning away and wiping his eyes.</p> 
               <p>Even Lady Grace was visibly affected, though she was silent.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE DEATH OF FLORENCE.</head> 
               <p>MY dear grandmother's remains were consigned to their last resting-place with every mark of respect. Sir Robert and Lady Grace, with the numerous retainers of the house, accompanied them to the parish church, where funeral services were read, and thence to their consignment in the family vault of the Greytons.</p> 
               <p>The dead would have asked no more than to be permitted to mingle her dust with that of these revered ones. She had few personal friends; her nature was too stern and concentrated to admit of many social ties, and so her departure made very little stir.</p> 
               <p>Her little all, the savings of many years, was left to<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC5593-00000157"/> myself: the last of her race. A few hundred pounds; yet, though, a trifle, wealth to me, inasmuch as it gave me, if need be, the means of independence for a time. For my late bitter experience at the Hall had left me with some chill misgivings. I shed tears of real sorrow over that grave, but they were more of sadness than affection, and then I returned to my post at the bedside of Florence.</p> 
               <p>There was no allusion made to any former difficulty. Once more together in our pleasant, home-like rooms, we lived only in the present; forgetting, as far as possible, the cloud that had recently overshadowed us,-and Florence, at least, was happy as a bird.</p> 
               <p>But she did not gain strength; the soft spring air in which she rejoiced, the sunshine in which she reveled, brought no returning tint to this pale flower.</p> 
               <p>Lady Grace was very kind to me, and Sir Robert all affection and tenderness. Of Adele we saw little; she had wisely concluded to absent herself, only appearing a few minutes each day to inquire after "her dear Florence."</p> 
               <p>In these visits she always contrived to leave the impression that she was in some way injured. I think Lady Grace looked upon her as a martyr. "Affectionate creature," she would say in an undertone, and sigh, as she witnessed Adele's coldly received demonstrations. Probably she pitied her for not having some object on which to expend those abundant affections. Had it not been for me, perhaps they might have been lavished on her own sweet child.</p> 
               <p>But, apparently, the young lady found means of enjoying herself in spite of our coldness. She did not<pb n=""/> lack companions; there was driving and horseback-riding, and there were spirited games on the lawn. Even to our remote little den often rose the echoes of their mirth. "But I have to force her from me to these enjoyments, dear, devoted girl!" the infatuated Lady Grace would remark.</p> 
               <p>Florence had at last consented to see a physician other than the good old family doctor; and the celebrated Sir Michael Donan was now hourly expected.</p> 
               <p>Sir Robert was in a fever of anxiety, walking in and out of the room. "It is for your sake, to please you and mamma, that I see him," said Florence. "<emph>I</emph> do not feel at all uneasy, papa!"</p> 
               <p>"Nor I, my love; only it will be a satisfaction to have his opinion. And you know I am waiting to see if you cannot travel with me this summer."</p> 
               <p>Dr. Finckley accompanied Sir Michael. Florence, at the time of their entrance, was sitting up in the large easy-chair. It was signified that the family should leave the room; I alone, as being necessary to her attendance, was allowed to remain. I stood beside the invalid with my heart beating strangely. What was to be the outcome of this solemn sitting? I did not know. I trembled with an unspoken fear.</p> 
               <p>Florence, however, was calm; whatever might come, she was better prepared than I was.</p> 
               <p>Sir Michael's countenance pleased me; he had a kind, tender manner. But my heart sank within me as I watched the varying expression of his face. There was in it a mingling of alarm and pity, not to be concealed even by professional cautiousness.</p> 
               <p>"Then he questioned me in regard to the patient,<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC5593-00000158"/> whose own answers had, however, been far more intelligent than mine. I could not frame a clear reply. Sick and faint, I saw the doom that was written in his face.</p> 
               <p>But with much tact he drew attention from my choked voice and incoherent utterance by cheerily rising to admire some little matters of adornment about the room; he smelled the flowers, he looked out of the windows at the lovely prospect.</p> 
               <p>"By Jove, Finckley!" he said, "this would make a sick man well." Then, smoothing Florence's shining hair tenderly, he said she was a brave girl, and he would come to see her again.</p> 
               <p>When they had left, Florence sat for a few moments thoughtful and silent. Presently she said, "Come, Olive dear, sit beside me; I want to talk to you."</p> 
               <p>I sank down upon the low seat she indicated.</p> 
               <p>"Do you know I am not going to get well, Olive?" she said.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Florence, my darling, I cannot bear it!" I cried; shocked to hear my own thoughts put into words.</p> 
               <p>She put her hand in mine quietly. "I have been for some time thinking of this, but did not dare to mention it; poor papa and mamma, it will grieve them so! But I see the doctor thinks as I do, Olive."</p> 
               <p>"He did not say anything like it!" I exclaimed, abruptly. "True; but it is all the same, dear. I understood it well. My Olive, we must bear the truth: my days are numbered."</p> 
               <p>"You will kill me!" I cried, unable to control my distress. "You will kill me if you talk in this way.<pb n=""/> Why mind what the doctors say. Can they not be mistaken?"</p> 
               <p>"To be sure they can?" she answered, smiling. "But their judgment in this matter has only strengthened my own opinion. I have long felt that I could not recover. Do you remember that night of the ball, Olive,-our birthnight ball, when I had that fearful chill in our room? I felt a shock then that seemed almost to part soul and body."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," I answered, with indignant remembrance, "I remember it as well as if it had been yesterday, all of it."</p> 
               <p>"Well, since that night death has been ever present to me. I have become used to the thought. I know I am careless many a time, Olive, speaking out my thoughts in a childish way; but this I have kept to myself. My greatest suffering has been for you; I dreaded to alarm you and the rest. I do not want to leave you! No, oh, no!" And she laid her young head on my breast, while the tears trickled down her sweet, pale face.</p> 
               <p>We mingled our tears together. I could not be as unselfish as she; I must have sympathy, and it was Florence who pitied and comforted and tried to inspire me with strength.</p> 
               <p>After this I grew calmer; I promised to be brave, to imitate her heroism,-to bear whatever might come.</p> 
               <p>"Papa will need all your support," she said, as a suppressed cry of anguish reached us from the outer room, where the doctor was conversing with her parents. "Poor papa!" she said. "They know it now."</p> 
               <p>Sir Michael was quite unaware that the family were<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC5593-00000159"/> so little prepared for anything serious in this illness. Dr. Finckley had hinted at it; but Dr. Finckley was the old family physician, as tender of the feelings of those who employed him as of their bodies. He did not wish to alarm any one, and presumed they could not be wholly ignorant of what to him was so painfully evident,-the gradual sinking of their favorite child.</p> 
               <p>Sir Michael met the anxious, inquiring looks of the parents with a doubtful shake of the head.</p> 
               <p>"But you do not consider her very ill?" was the alarmed question.</p> 
               <p>"She is a very sick girl," he answered, sadly.</p> 
               <p>"But not dangerously so? Surely, doctor, you do not mean to say this? Oh, no, it cannot be-our darling, our delight,-it <emph>cannot be!</emph> She has always been delicate; she needs some strengthening medicine, does she not,-some change, you mean?"</p> 
               <p>He was much distressed. Used to painful scenes as he was, he was hardly prepared for this, and the sweet girl had interested him deeply.</p> 
               <p>"Would that I could give you hope!" he exclaimed.</p> 
               <p>"Hope!" repeated Lady Grace. "You cannot mean there is no hope?"</p> 
               <p>"I fear there is not."</p> 
               <p>The stern self-repression of the mother gave way at this unexpected blow. She fell back in her chair unconscious.</p> 
               <p>"I cannot bear it!" said Sir Robert, pacing the floor in anguish. It was his cry of despair that penetrated to us in our chamber.</p> 
               <p>"God will help you to bear it," said the sympathizing physician; "he is merciful."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"He will not be merciful if he takes my angel-child from me," was the father's reply.</p> 
               <p>Poor Sir Robert!-he was not impious,-for his blessings he had a heart full of gratitude,-but he could not reconcile this terrible visitation with any of his ideas of mercy.</p> 
               <p>The household was stricken as with a sudden blight. All that had been sunny and joyous crept away in the shadow. For Florence had been the pride and the delight of all. Love and peace had reigned in her presence; they were her attributes. There was nothing unpleasant to remember; her life had been one long ray of sunshine. Yet every one felt that she must not be disturbed with their grief. It was their place to show cheerful faces and speak pleasant words; but, oh, the bitter trial of doing this!</p> 
               <p>Sir Robert was still rebellious; still he could not submit; Florence must get well. She would get well if she but did as he wished; if she would go about in the fresh air every day, ride or walk, take exercise as of old.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, when she gets strong enough, Olive," he said, with reckless attempt at pleasantry, "we will be off, you and I, with our invalid to the South of France, and have a glorious time."</p> 
               <p>Florence would smile at this. "I will try my very best to get well, papa," she said; and added, with a sigh, when he was gone, "Poor papa!"</p> 
               <p>And she made the effort heroically; taking the daily drive when it had become a pain and trial to her, and she was too feeble to be benefited by it longer.</p> 
               <p>In one of these drives we met Major Trenchard.<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC5593-00000160"/> He had been very ill, and his face bore evidence still of suffering, both mental and physical. The separation from Florence had sunk deeper in his heart than his pride would admit; and the more he had reflected since their last interview, the more he was disposed to exonerate her for the decision she had made, and to regard himself as a despicable trifler, very far from the high standard of a man of honor, such as he had once regarded himself. He remembered that he had sought by every means to gain the affection of an innocent young heart, and when secure of his prize had trifled with and wounded that heart in its finest sensibilities, its most delicate sensitiveness, and for what? To minister to the vanity of a vain and ambitious woman, who made use of him only to stir up rivalry in another, whom she sought to win by every scheme and wile at her command. "I have been a fool," he said, "and truly I have had my reward."</p> 
               <p>On the day we met he was riding slowly along, thoughtful and absorbed; seeing the Greyton carriage approach, he lifted his hat. At first I think he did not see Florence; but, as I leaned forward to return his bow, he caught a glimpse of her reclining on the cushions, exhausted and with eyes closed. He must have been painfully startled, for she did at that moment look death-like. He asked the coachman to stop a moment; and, coming to the side of the carriage, inquired with much anxiety if she were very ill.</p> 
               <p>The voice roused Florence completely. She sat up, the color rising to her face, but without the slightest confusion replied, smiling her old, bright smile, "Oh, no, I am not very ill, only very tired."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"But you have been ill," he said, and seemed prompted to wonder why he had not been informed of it. Some bitter reflections, however, reminded him probably that he had no right now to be thought of in connection with this pure, pale young creature; he had forfeited all right of recognition even as her friend. There was a certain humility in his tone as he asked if he might see her again,-might have the privilege of calling on her.</p> 
               <p>The request was granted in the frank and kindly manner usual with Florence, and we parted.</p> 
               <p>But every day now brought added weakness; the drives had to be abandoned; even Sir Robert admitted they were doing her no service.</p> 
               <p>"And now, papa," she would say, "only let me be quiet in our own sweet little room with Olive, and you and mamma coming in every little while, and even though a sick girl, I may live with you a long, long time."</p> 
               <p>"Well, my love, you shall have it just your own way," said the father, with forced gayety.</p> 
               <p>When told that Major Trenchard was coming to call upon his daughter, Sir Robert was at first displeased. He had somehow connected the gentleman with this illness,-in what way he hardly knew himself. However, he laughed off his thoughts, saying, good-humoredly, that he had never altogether liked this major, but it might have been his red coat.</p> 
               <p>And so Major Trenchard came. And thereafter, nearly every afternoon an hour before sunset he would be with us. He seemed altogether saddened and crushed, sitting beside Florence the brief time allowed<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC5593-00000161"/> him, scarcely uttering a word. At parting she would speak and smile brightly, giving him her hand. The major's only answer was to raise the thin fingers to his lips and sigh.</p> 
               <p>Yet she grew to long for his coming. She had loved him once as she had never loved any one before, as she never now would love any one again. He had been her idol, her ideal, calling forth all the enthusiasm of her nature. The idol was dethroned now utterly; she had learned to look upon her god as a very ordinary mortal, perhaps, but she pitied and loved him still. She felt for his pangs, his disappointment, his weakness, and she would have saved him with her life if she could.</p> 
               <p>Arthur had not been heard from since the sad news of his sister's danger had been communicated to him. Of course there were letters coming from him, but none since then. He was moving from place to place; he seemed possessed by a wonderful restlessness, and probably the information had not yet reached him.</p> 
               <p>His absence was about the only thing that fretted the invalid. "Oh, if he should not come, Olive! if I should not see him!" was her cry.</p> 
               <p>"But you will see him, dear," I would answer, confidently. "I know you will."</p> 
               <p>One morning she surprised her father and myself-we were the only persons in the room-by saying, "Papa, I have a strong desire to see Mr. Massarene."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Massarene!" ejaculated Sir Robert, with astonishment.</p> 
               <p>"Well, papa, if you have any objections, I will not think of it again. I know you were hardly good<pb n=""/> friends, but that was so long ago. And he has always been so kind to me. I <emph>do</emph> want to see him!"</p> 
               <p>"And you shall, sweet love. I will go myself and ask him to come. It may be humiliating, but-"</p> 
               <p>"But, papa, I will not have you humiliated for my sake."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps, my dear, that is not exactly the word. Rather say I will ennoble myself by admitting my wrong. But this is all a mystery to you, children. Come, I will begin by making a confession."</p> 
               <p>"Not a confession!" we said, in a breath.</p> 
               <p>Pained at the word, I looked at Sir Robert, struck by a certain change in him, which had not impressed me before. This burly, pleasure-seeking man was becoming strangely humanized and lovable; he was growing every day more like Florence. It seemed as if something of her parting spirit was being breathed into him.</p> 
               <p>"Well, girls," he said, laughing, with something like the hearty pleasantry of old, "if you will not listen to a confession perhaps you will to a story, eh? An episode of my young, foolish days.</p> 
               <p>"In my young days Massarene and myself were closest friends. We went through college together. We were also near neighbors, which brought us into more intimate association. He was always ahead of me in everything we undertook, and I foolishly fancied that he sometimes assumed a sort of mastery over me; this idea occasionally gave rise to unpleasant feeling between us; too brief at first to mar our friendship perceptibly. However, circumstances at last deepened and darkened this shadow between us. A pretty lass<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC5593-00000162"/> came in our way, with whom we both fell in love,-or imagined we did,-that is, what such youngsters call love.</p> 
               <p>"I, of course, the more impetuous of the two, went at the matter in hot haste. She was a true and noble girl, but not in my position in life, and so my young friend Massarene thought fit to bring me to an account, demanding what my intentions were. A quarrel, of course, followed. In my heat and excitement I said many unjustifiable things, and a duel was the result."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, papa!"</p> 
               <p>"Both were wounded. My wound was, however, very slight; but Massarene bears to-day the marks of that quarrel. You have noticed that he is slightly lame?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, we had both noted that."</p> 
               <p>"It was the result of the wound then received. The encounter was an inexcusable one on my side, but it saved your mother, Olive."</p> 
               <p>"My mother!" I exclaimed, in astonishment.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, your mother; for her sake you owe him much."</p> 
               <p>I remembered my grandmother had once said the same thing.</p> 
               <p>"And is that the whole story?" we asked.</p> 
               <p>"I am not good, I find, at story-telling," said Sir Robert, smiling. "But now you know the true cause of our quarrel. Is not that enough? You can guess the rest, for I have to be in Dublin with Lady Grace a few hours this morning. I shall call at Massarene's on my way, and if he is the noble fellow of old, perhaps he will be up this very morning to visit this spoiled<pb n=""/> child, this little lady who will play the invalid instead of riding out with her old father."</p> 
               <p>We laughed, and Sir Robert went off gayly, as if some secret hope of his child's recovery still animated him.</p> 
               <p>He was right about his old friend. Not long after his departure Mr. Massarene himself appeared on the threshold.</p> 
               <p>How my heart bounded to meet him as he entered! There was the same noble aspect, the same frank charm of manner that had as children won our love and trust. He leaned heavily on his gold-headed cane, as he walked in with that peculiar halt, which now to me was full of meaning, an added charm and interest.</p> 
               <p>"I am so glad to see you, dear Mr. Massarene," said Florence, her eyes beaming as she saw him. "You are so very kind to come."</p> 
               <p>"I wanted to see my little girl," he answered, kissing the hand she held out. "You know you are one of my pets."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Mr. Massarene," she replied, while the tears gathered in her beautiful eyes, "I do love you very dearly! But I am so changed,-you did not expect to see me so altered?" she asked, with her usual direct simplicity.</p> 
               <p>"Well, no, perhaps not," he answered, with hesitation; "but you know it is a long time since I last saw you. Let me see-how many years-then you were a little romping girl with rosy cheeks and frolicsome spirit; now you are a young lady. We would not expect such boisterous animation and health. I dare say Olive does not think you much changed."</p>

               <p>Florence smiled. "Ah, you cannot deceive me," was her quiet comment.</p> 
               <p>I saw that with all Mr. Massarene's tact he could ill conceal the shock he had experienced on first seeing her. He had been told she was ill, but had not expected to find so great an alteration. He drew a chair beside her, still continuing to caress her soft hand.</p> 
               <p>"Dear child," he repeated, "you are very dear to me. What can I do for you?"</p> 
               <p>"Come here, Olive; bring your chair close; let us all be near together. You love Olive, too, don't you, Mr. Massarene?"</p> 
               <p>I thought he started. Perhaps he misunderstood the simple frankness which dictated the question. A feeling of pride rose within me; he should not be obliged in deference to my feelings to assert a sentiment he did not feel. I was about to speak, when he laid his hand upon mine, and said, promptly, "I do love her with all my heart. You know this, Olive, do you not?" his eyes beamed on me kindly and tenderly as he spoke, and made me ashamed of my misgivings.</p> 
               <p>"Then, Mr. Massarene, you will see to Olive,-you will cherish her, will you not? This is what I want to see you about. Papa would always care for Olive, I know, and so would mamma; but in time to come,-when I am gone,-there will be some one in this house whom Olive would not wish to be with. I want you to tell me, dear friend, that she will have a home with you, and then I will be content."</p> 
               <p>None of us now could refrain from tears, even Florence shed some. Dear, disinterested girl! even I,<pb n=""/> who knew her so well, had not fathomed the depth of her love and solicitude.</p> 
               <p>It was some minutes before Mr. Massarene could reply. Presently he said, with the utmost solemnity, "Florence, I accept this sacred charge you give me, and thank you for honoring me with such a trust;" and turning to me, he added, "Will you, Olive, accept my fostering care?"</p> 
               <p>I could only sob out my gratitude, and hastened from the room to try and master my emotion.</p> 
               <p>Florence was much fatigued after this interview. I begged her to lie down and rest, and she submitted quietly, as usual. She lay long, and apparently rested sweetly. Sir Robert and Lady Grace returning, were cheered and hopeful to find her in so tranquil a sleep, and left to dine.</p> 
               <p>On awaking, she asked to be placed in her favorite chair at the window. The air was tranquil and pleasant; it was twilight,-the long twilight evening of the early days of May, when in our climate the light is serenely clear as though the sun yet lingered above the horizon.</p> 
               <p>"This is the hour I love, Olive," said the invalid. "In such an hour I would like to depart-if I could but see Arthur before I go."</p> 
               <p>I could never altogether command myself when she talked of death, and now she chided my tears.</p> 
               <p>"Let me, Olive sweet, speak of it. It is not so fearful as you think, and I feel more composed and better when I talk about it. When the good Dean visits me,-and I have no doubt he talks very right and proper,-I have such a shivering dread; but with<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC5593-00000164"/> you, Olive, it is just as I am every day when I am awake and when I sleep-as if some dear, loving Something was coaxing, caressing, urging me not to fear. What can it be, Olive?"</p> 
               <p>"Maybe, dear, it comes from the good angels."</p> 
               <p>"So I think, Olive. You know I was always weak about these things, believing easily."</p> 
               <p>"Not that, Florence. You were ever such an angel yourself, you may have had such influences about you, and felt them as others would not. You know, dear," I added, as she remained silent, "this is not flattery. I was never given to that."</p> 
               <p>"I understand, sweet sister; this is not the hour for such mockery. You have ever been true and faithful to me. I have never been tempted as others are. I have loved every one, and every one has loved me. <choice>
                     <sic>I</sic>
                     <corr>It</corr>
                  </choice> is only lately I have learned some of life's darker phases, and I do not regret the experience, for life to me has now a much broader meaning, and I sometimes am sad that, when its many duties and needs are opening before me, I must go away. There is so much to do, and I have done so little, Olive, so little."</p> 
               <p>I saw that she was much excited; her eyes sparkled with unusual brilliancy, her cheeks were tinged with color. She was evidently feverish, and I urged her gently to rest, not to fatigue herself with further conversation.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, let me talk a little," she pleaded,-"there is no time to lose! I want to speak of Arthur. I wish I could say all I feel. And were I leaving him with you, Olive, as I used sometimes to dream might be, I should be happy, happy indeed. You would have done<pb n=""/> him so much good, have brought forth all his noble qualities-are you listening, Olive darling? I did not mean to grieve you,-but that other who has chosen Arthur, but whom he would never have chosen-dearest, I cannot help it-I wish so much it had been otherwise, and I pity Arthur so much."</p> 
               <p>"It is all for the best, Florence," I said. "Arthur needs a wife in his own position. But now let me tell you what I have never told another, scarcely whispered to myself. I <emph>have</emph> loved Arthur, Florence. Why should I not own it? Long and deeply, with sorrow and bitterness of spirit, I have loved him; but it is over now."</p> 
               <p>She threw her arms around me and kissed me. That sweet, silent sympathy was a balm to my heart. I felt stronger, more courageous. "Yes," I said, inwardly, "it <emph>is</emph> over. I will henceforth throw the infatuation from me."</p> 
               <p>We sat silently for some time, Florence leaning back in her cushioned chair, her eyes closed, her countenance peaceful. How lovely and child-like that face appeared now when it was about to pass from my sight forever! Framed in its mass of golden hair, subdued, spirituelle, with its infantile purity of expression unmarred by contact with the world and worldly things, it seemed already beaming with light from another world.</p> 
               <p>I sighed as I gazed. She opened her eyes and smiled.</p> 
               <p>"Now, Olive," she said, "traitorous Olive, I will have you smile and be happy, and, behold, you disobey as soon as I take my eyes away. Why, I am so favored,<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC5593-00000165"/> I suffer so little. It is only this cough that teases me at times." She raised her handkerchief to her lips. I saw that there was blood upon it. Terribly alarmed, I rang the bell vehemently.</p> 
               <p>"Be calm, Olive," she said, as I ran to support her, while the life-stream seemed oozing slowly from her lips. "You must not be frightened now, if I am going away. Sister, I hear wheels," she said. How keen her senses were! <emph>I</emph> heard nothing.</p> 
               <p>In a few moments the family were all gathered in the room, and, to my astonishment, Arthur entered with the rest. She saw him, a glance of infinite love shone from her eyes upon him as, rushing forward, he clasped his sister in his arms. She clung to him a moment, then lay back exhausted upon her pillows. "Olive!" I heard her murmur, "Olive!"</p> 
               <p>"Love, dearest love, what <emph>shall</emph> I do?" I cried, laying my head near hers. She threw her arms about my neck, and in the effort the tide of life ebbed forever.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE UPRISING.</head> 
               <p>OF the desolation at the Hall, the gloom which enshrouded the household, no words can give an idea. Its light, its hope, its pride was gone, desolation and complete abandonment to grief followed. The blow so long expected had fallen at last, but with such final<pb n=""/> suddenness that none could say they were prepared for it.</p> 
               <p>But so it ever is. No one, perhaps, is ever quite prepared for that last shock of separation. We fancy that if a little more time were given us, if it were permitted to come more gently upon us, we should more gracefully accept the fact, but in this undoubtedly we deceive ourselves. We are never ready for Death.</p> 
               <p>As for myself, I was utterly prostrated. Lifeless and helpless I lay on the bed where they carried, me when the arms of the dying girl relaxed their clasp about my neck. I could bear no word of comfort, I could listen to no consolation, closing my heart against it as with impenetrable bars. I could only cry in my anguish, "Florence! Florence!"</p> 
               <p>I remember trying to reason with myself, to shame myself. Why should I add to the misery of those so sorely stricken? Why should I not help rather to strengthen and comfort them? I did try. I endeavored to rise and do something, but it was only to fall back helpless on the couch.</p> 
               <p>Indeed, I was really ill. The doctor was sent for. He ordered strengthening food; I must be compelled to eat something. Then Sir Robert came; his stricken face, his bowed frame, renewed my grief. "Oh, it is selfish of me to distress you thus!" I cried. "But I cannot help it! I cannot help it!"</p> 
               <p>He kissed my forehead and stroked my aching head. "Poor child!" he said.</p> 
               <p>They took me to have a last look at Florence, as she lay enshrouded in her white robe and covered with fragrant white lilies. I fell back in the arms of those<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC5593-00000166"/> who bore me. Ah, surely to none was the loss so great as to me! She was my all. Never separated, thinking alike, loving alike, with kindred tastes and feelings, we had grown together as one.</p> 
               <p>How long I lay I know not; it might have been days, it might have been weeks. A dim unconsciousness hung over my faculties, a deathly weakness prostrated my nerves, a strange paralysis of will not to be shaken off. At times I heard vaguely the voice of Lady Grace; I caught with an intolerable shudder the voice of Adele.</p> 
               <p>While I lay there helpless, a care and a trial, the one whom I despised, the one whom in my fevered imagination I blamed as the cause of all this, had made herself invaluable,-<emph>she</emph> had been the prop and support of the whole-household. I had been only an added burden. Energetic, clear-headed, she thought of everything, attended to everything. She comforted Lady Grace, she wept with Sir Robert. "How could we live without her?" Lady Grace would say to her son. "Oh, Arthur, in this fearful loneliness, what a blessing it would be to have her always near us!"</p> 
               <p>"And you shall have it so," he answered, with a broken voice. "Mother, I will do all that man can do to help and comfort you."</p> 
               <p>I heard these whispered words as I lay stupid, unthinking, conscious of but one thought, of one fearful, crushing weight. A slow, burning fever was consuming me.</p> 
               <p>One day I was startled from my deadly stupor by a wild sound of lamentation. Letty stood at my bedside weeping and wringing her hands.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Miss Olive! Miss Olive, won't ye listen?"<pb n=""/> she cried. "Oh, they're killing them all, the Lord save us! Poor Master Walter and your own father, Miss Olive!"</p> 
               <p>All this went through my head like some distant, confused murmur. I heard it all, I comprehended its meaning, but it did not seem to belong to me.</p> 
               <p>At last hearing it repeated again and again with various changes, my weary senses began to rouse to its import. I listened, painfully and with effort.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Miss Olive! It's worse and worse! They're murdering every one!" Another loud outbreak of lamentation.</p> 
               <p>I remember giving a deep, quivering sigh. I remember a sharp, short spasm of pain that seemed to reach my very heart; then with struggle, with powerful effort, as though lifting myself through some dead, dark solidity, I sat up suddenly in the bed, looking with wild, uncertain gaze at Letty's tear-stained face and terrified aspect.</p> 
               <p>For a few brief moments I was confused and bewildered, but only for a few moments. Memory returned with its heavy burden, and, as when we awaken from some fearful nightmare the heart still trembles and the terror remains, so I recalled all that had passed, and shuddered to take up again the burden of life.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Letty," I cried, "I know it all now!-she's gone! she's gone!"</p> 
               <p>"In heaven's rest be her soul," said Letty, devoutly crossing herself. "My sainted young mistress! But it is not of her, Miss Olive, this trouble is in my heart." And then by degrees I heard Letty's story, and, making allowance for all the rumors that were<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC5593-00000167"/> afloat, I gathered for a certainty that the rebellion had actually broken out.</p> 
               <p>My head whirled with the excitement this news wrought in me. I felt as if I must shake off this benumbing weakness, get out into the fresh air and the great world, and take part in the stirring events transpiring. But the good housekeeper, Mrs. O'Neil, laid her motherly hand upon my hot forehead, and wisely gave me a composing draught, assuring me that if I would be quiet I should know everything.</p> 
               <p>Strange as it may seem, there were no serious consequences from this rough awakening, rather the reverse. My thoughts were directed from their morbid melancholy to a more active distress. The new and painful anxiety, the dread anticipations, were of a nature less wearing than the intense, self-concentrated woe that was destroying me.</p> 
               <p>I had not heard from either my father or Walter since I parted from them on the road on the morning of his escape. The times were full of peril, of excitement, of portentous meaning. For many nights there had been fires burning on the mountains of Wicklow; by many it was feared these indicated some belligerent purpose, but others scouted the thought. Were not the government troops numerous and vigilant in the neighborhood? were not the poor, unarmed people utterly cowed? Still, the rumor went whispering round that stealthy steps wandered over these mountains in the dead of night, that men were searching in these fastnesses for their concealed weapons. Suspicion, danger, keen interest, were all astir while I had been sleeping.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>True, these were poor men, these uneasy, disaffected spirits,-they were men who had never seen battle; their arms were only old blunderbusses and pikes, or rusty bayonets,-anything they could gather in the shape of weapons; but the government feared them, the government watched them. They were strong of arm and firm of purpose, for oppression and wrong had made them desperate, and in some almost stifled their natural kindliness, their very humanity.</p> 
               <p>A wide-spread plot had been discovered, which was to have been the signal of a general uprising. The city of Dublin was to have been attacked, and a general warfare was to have been inaugurated. This plot had been discovered in time to defeat all the plans of the rebel leaders; but true to their pledge, in more distant places the gathering had commenced. They could not retreat: their blood was up; and the green flag of their country floated over many a wild hill-top and lonely gorge where they held secret rendezvous.</p> 
               <p>In some of the counties there had been skirmishing between the people and the troops; still, there was as yet little real alarm. It was thought to be but a question of a few hours; it would soon be over. But each day brought accounts of fresh outbreaks. Towns had been attacked and barracks burned, some fearful acts of retribution had been committed. So far the rebels had been successful. It was admitted there must be some excellent leaders among them.</p> 
               <p>Consternation spread everywhere; the apparent defeat of the plot against Dublin grew less and less matter of congratulation; it seemed to have imbittered the rural districts to frenzy; everywhere the insurgents<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC5593-00000168"/> gathered strength daily. The quiet agricultural district of Wexford, to which we were in close proximity, was now in arms. Farmers had left their plows, and laborers their seed-sowing, to join the insurrectionists. People reasoned that if the prosperous and orderly men of Wexford had risen, there must be good cause for it, and the rebellion must be gathering numbers, and in prospect of successful issue.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">WAR AND RUMORS OF WAR.</head> 
               <p>AT the Hall there was much consternation. Lady Grace, though a woman of strong nerve, had been so shaken by her recent affliction, that her usual immobility was giving way. She grew ill and exacting, excited and fretful. She was constantly urging Sir Robert to fly to England, and was in terror of her own servants and all about the place. It was said she never left her room, save when accompanied by Adele and Arthur.</p> 
               <p>Sir Robert, however, could not be induced to leave the Hall. "They may burn the place over my head," he remarked, "but they will never touch me."</p> 
               <p>This confidence, however, did not ease his wife. She talked of dismissing all the servants and sending to England for others. "They will poison us, they will betray us," said her ladyship; "my life, all our lives, will be sacrificed."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Hearing of these suspicions somehow gave me pain. Perhaps Lady Grace included me also in this general condemnation. She had not visited my room in some time,-not at all since I had returned to consciousness. I felt hurt; I felt that I had better leave. Now that this thought had taken hold of me, it pursued me still-Lady Grace is afraid of me.</p> 
               <p>There was no one at the Hall now who needed me. Of Arthur I saw and heard nothing, save that he and Miss Adele were always together. Sometimes, as I sat at my window, I had seen the two walking slowly in the bordering paths of the park, she leaning on his arm.</p> 
               <p>How completely deserted I felt! The love of my lost Florence had seemed to fill all the world for me; it had been father, mother, sister, friend. And now I was alone; such a loneliness that life almost stood still in its calm.</p> 
               <p>Every day, until I showed signs of recovery, Sir Robert, I was told, had come in and sat by my bedside for an hour or more; but the past few days of accumulated anxiety and trouble had overwhelmed him; he sat moody and silent in his chair.</p> 
               <p>The fears and lamentations of Lady Grace seemed to fret him; he sometimes replied impatiently; otherwise, since the death of Florence, the hale and genial Sir Robert had grown subdued and strangely quiet.</p> 
               <p>The growing feeling that I was not wanted haunted me continually, and a wild desire to go somewhere, anywhere away from the Hall, possessed me beyond control. I was still so weak that I could hardly walk, but I exerted myself to get down to the lodge. I found everything there still as my grandmother had left<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC5593-00000169"/> it, no one having been appointed to fill her place; the boy and girl as usual attending the gate.</p> 
               <p>Another strange infatuation had also possessed me during my illness; and from this infatuation I desired by every effort of will, by every possible chance of change, to free myself. I had a nervous dread of seeing Adele, or rather of having her come to see me. I felt that if she did so, I could take no refuge in subterfuge, I must tell her all that was on my mind.</p> 
               <p>Harassed and wretched, I listened to every footstep, and glanced up with fear and trembling every time the door was opened. I did not want to tell her the thought that burdened me beyond endurance. I did not want to avow that I knew her for what she was,-the murderess of Florence; but I might not be able to control myself. Doubtless my mind was diseased, weak and sick as was my body-but I felt that my only escape from this dire necessity was to leave the house. I must get away from her at once and forever. I did not stop to reflect that in her own breast was a monitor which might some time prove as faithful as I dreaded to find myself.</p> 
               <p>So, gathering up a few things, I announced to Letty that I was going to the lodge, and that I should not be back very soon.</p> 
               <p>"When are you going, Miss Olive?"</p> 
               <p>"Now, this very evening."</p> 
               <p>"This evening!" she exclaimed. "Why, you are scarcely able to walk across the floor!"</p> 
               <p>But I went. So urgent had become the feeling to get away from my old home, that it admitted of no longer delay.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>I left a note for Sir Robert and his lady, expressing my deep gratitude for the kindness and care they had extended to me all my life, but stating that I now felt I must depend upon myself, though I would not take any step without their concurrence. Then directing Letty how to arrange my little matters, and what to bring me at the lodge, I set forth alone, much to Letty's disturbance, who begged that she might accompany me. "You will surely fall, Miss Olive," she said, "if you have no one to lean on."</p> 
               <p>But I did not want to lean on any one; I desired to test my strength, to rouse myself to exertion.</p> 
               <p>I took the back road leading to the lodge. Passing out of the garden-gate, and through a shaded path overhung with vines and bordered by sweet shrubs, I reached the lane. Everything was silent about the place; every laborer on the grounds, the moment he was released, was off to some rendezvous to hear the news and what had been going on during the day. For although this was reputed a loyalist family, and as a matter of course those in their employ were supposed to be of the same tendency, yet the servitors of Greyton Hall sympathized secretly, heart and soul, with the rebellion. Indeed, it was a trial for any Irishman to do otherwise, and even to Sir Robert it was no easy task to maintain his long-held position of fealty to a government so strangely ill-advised in its management, so cruelly and grossly ignorant of the needs and distress of his native land.</p> 
               <p>So I encountered no one on my way, and in the calm of this secluded walk I gained strength with every step. I reached the lodge glad as a child who had come<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC5593-00000170"/> home after long absence, yet weeping as I entered the familiar little parlor and sat down in my grandmother's leather-backed chair. Renewed courage, renewed hopefulness, came to me as I wept; I had made a great effort: had shaken off a terrible incubus. It seemed as if the quaint little apartment was peopled with those I loved, as if Florence were near me, and in the blessed illusion I held out my arms as if to clasp her to me.</p> 
               <p>Betty came in, and was overjoyed to see me. "An' will ye stay here, miss, and forever?" she cried, with real welcome.</p> 
               <p>I had her throw open all the doors and windows. The vines drooped through the open casement, and the high bushes laden with roses scattered their bloom over the floor as the sash was raised.</p> 
               <p>Such an exuberant spring and early summer this had been! The climate of Ireland is always balmy and delicious, yet this season was remarked by all as having surpassed itself; the skies were cloudless, and leaf and flower had put forth their richest abundance. Nature had worked here her perfect work, as if to soften man's spirit, to touch him to kindlier emotions, to better sympathies. Alas, she expended her sweets in vain!</p> 
               <p>The fierce fight was still going on. Proclamations were being issued from the capital which even made the more thoughtful of the loyalist party shudder with horror. It was to be a war of extermination. No quarter was to be given, and those taken alive were to be executed on the spot.</p> 
               <p>Still, the insurgents were unyielding. In most instances they were successful in the skirmishes which took place, and great numbers of the government officers<pb n=""/> cers and men were wounded or killed. The matter was growing serious; it was evident that a great decisive battle must soon be fought.</p> 
               <p>Repeated engagements, the troops driving the rebels from one point to another, gradually brought the terrible scene of warfare close upon us. The troops at Arklow, with their numerous garrison, were threatened; large reinforcements had been sent to this quarter, and the troops were ordered at all risks to meet the insurgents and arrest their progress.</p> 
               <p>The whole county of Wexford was in the hands of the people, and in their repeated victories the rebels had gained large stores of ammunition and fire-arms; yet, after all, it was doubtful whether they would be able to cope with the skilled and disciplined regular troops. More than courage, more even than indignant sense of outrage and burning desire for revenge, is needed to supply the sinews of war.</p> 
               <p>Some days passed, and I heard nothing from the Hall. I was not surprised at this. The consternation of the household, the illness of Lady Grace, the disconsolate quiescence of its master, left little room for outer interest. I would have gone up to the house myself, knowing the excitement and terror that must reign there. But what could I do? No one wanted me; no one inquired for me; only Sir Robert, I thought, would care to see me, and my presence would only add to the confusion.</p> 
               <p>From Betty I was hearing all that was going on. The success of the insurgents was bringing them nearer and nearer. I could see their watch-fires through the night among the hills. The government troops had<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC5593-00000171"/> been defeated at Arklow, were ordered back, reinforced, and were to make another decided stand against the enemy.</p> 
               <p>Day after day, at this time, troops from the capital came marching by with their heavy pieces of artillery; whose rumbling, unwieldy strength shook the earth.</p> 
               <p>But nothing daunted, the insurgents prepared for the issue; their leaders would not allow their enthusiasm to cool, and on the eve of the expected conflict there was busy stir of preparation. Entrenchments were being hastily thrown up around the encampment; sentinels were stationed, and advanced guards were constantly on the watch. Over twenty thousand men were ready on that night to march forward at a moment's notice.</p> 
               <p>But, alas! how inadequate the means to the end! These men were poorly equipped; perhaps not one-quarter of them were provided with fire-arms. They had but few cannon, and, compared with the resources of their enemies, were pitifully scant of ammunition. Many had only pikes wherewith to defend themselves, but their patriotic ardor was unquenchable. They shouted for victory and the Republic of Ireland, and, inspired with the new-born sense of liberty, thousands of voices joined in the chorus of "Erin mavourneen, Erin go bragh!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE BATTLE.</head> 
               <p>THE final battle had yet to be fought which was to decide the fate of the nation. The insurgent forces had been in active operation some weeks, and during that time had been singularly successful; daily recruits were strengthening their numbers, while that wild enthusiasm which had marked their early efforts was fast giving way to calmer, more deliberate judgments. There were cool, strong heads among them as their leaders-strong in the power of their own resources; and this was beginning to be felt and understood in high places; it was not a mere rabble they had to deal with, ready for change or excitement, or to fight for the love of fighting, but men sacrificing all, suffering all, in their daily pains and privations, and willing still to suffer in the strength and intensity of a high and noble resolve.</p> 
               <p>At the first outbreak of hostilities the authorities had looked upon this uprising as a mere mob-fight that could be quelled by one sanguinary stroke. It had commenced in an obscure place, and among an obscure people. Apparently the great body of the influential masses, whom they had most feared, were either indifferent about this movement, or else overawed by the immense preparations that had been making to suppress it, for they made no motion that could be perceived.<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC5593-00000172"/> But time revealed to the government its grave mistake. This was no insignificant matter. There had been several encounters between the military and insurgents, and the latter, most unexpectedly, had come off victorious. It was but a few days previous that a numerous detachment of troops, headed by their colonel, had been surprised and totally routed, their commander slain, cannon, arms, and ammunition captured, and the whole body obliged to fly for safety to the town they had just left.</p> 
               <p>And now the rebels, elated by their victory, and strengthened by the ammunition and arms they had captured, were in full force on the heights, near Gorey, in sight of their recent triumph. Something must be done, and that at once, to stop their further progress, and also to recover the lost prestige of British invincibility. And, indeed, there was danger of the whole country being laid open to the rebels, so unbounded was the joy-but ill-concealed-at their success beginning to be manifested in every direction.</p> 
               <p>The government made no delay; a hasty council of war was held, when it was determined to immediately concentrate all available forces within reach, and by one grand stroke give the final blow.</p> 
               <p>In fulfillment of this determination, over thirteen thousand of their best troops,-men of endurance, men inured to war, well disciplined, who made fighting their trade, their glory,-with plenty of ammunition, cannon, arms, and all the machinery of destruction in complete order, marched on the eve of this fatal twenty-first of June, 1798, to take position on the plains beneath the heights on which were stationed<pb n=""/> these scores of hardy, undisciplined men, ready in the impatience of their glowing enthusiasm to meet any foe, any number of foes, not stopping to reflect on the vast odds, the fearful, damaging odds, that existed between themselves and their enemies.</p> 
               <p>Where were their skilled marksmen, their men of endurance, of discipline, well used to all the sights and horrors of their bloody work? Where were their materials to work with, even though they had been thus skilled? Arms and ammunition were wanting; their meagre supplies were only obtainable with difficulty and secrecy; every outward circumstance was against them. But they had a united purpose. This stood them for much,-they were striving for a principle, for freedom-for their very manhood-to prove themselves, to throw off that incubus that was crushing them below themselves. For this they would fight. If they could not win it, they could die.</p> 
               <p>Thus sanguine and determined in their resolutions, the great body could look down on the gathering masses below them without fear. Their position was invaluable,-it commanded the approaches of the advancing enemy; and on they worked with great spirit, strengthening their defenses until far on in the night, when from absolute exhaustion all that might threw themselves on the ground to seek a few hours' rest.</p> 
               <p>But there were those there, who, while partaking of this enthusiasm, these hopes, these unbounded desires, yet comprehended the difficulties, the full responsibility of that which was before them; and sitting by the watch-fires through the still hours of that eventful night their thoughts were filled with anxious, sad forebodings.</p> 
               <pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC5593-00000173"/> 
               <p>What though they did overcome this tremendous opposing foe,-how much was yet to be done, even were there a Washington of the old world, as there was a Washington of the new, to lead them on their march of triumph with all the serene grandeur of an unselfish patriotism!</p> 
               <p>As they looked round on that mighty mass of restless, intrepid, determined men, they knew that but one desire, one ardent longing, pulsated in every heart; but that desire accomplished, how might it be? How were all these ambitions, these aspirations, to be satisfied? Simple patriotism animated all now, but how complex the problems following upon success!</p> 
               <p>So were there also those on that dark plain beneath who had their doubts and misgivings. They had watched carefully the activity of those who held the height; they had seen by the flickering glare of the watch-fires, and through the gathering shades of night, the indefatigable leaders riding through their ranks amid approving shouts and loud hurrahs. Such foes, so full of life and fire and energy, might prove truly invincible-a rush, a dash, and legions might be overcome; watchful and wary they must be, and even then they knew not what would be the end of all this.</p> 
               <p>But the morning rose brightly, fair, soft and summer-like; a busy hum pervaded the atmosphere; all were alive, gloomy forebodings had vanished with the night, and hope and expectation rose high with the advancing sun. The insurgents had resolved to await the attack.</p> 
               <p>And now the long lines of British soldiery, mounted and on foot, began to move forward, their bright scarlet uniforms and well-polished weapons glittering<pb n=""/> in the sun. On they came, silent and firm, these men of iron muscle. The loud command of the mounted leaders, or the rattle of the artillery over the uneven ground, the tramp of men and horse, broke the stillness as onward and upward still they moved. They could now see the hard, resolute faces of those who stood ready to receive them (but who dare not yet waste their fire), with the green flag of their country floating high above. But no more they saw. On came the rush, with the cries of the fallen, the sharp crack of the musketry, the roar of the cannon, the shouts of the commanders, "On to the front! more to the front!" their answering legions only to be hewn down like the rest.</p> 
               <p>Oh! unholy war! thou stifler of all that is generous and merciful within us! thou promoter and instigator of all that is evil,-merging the man in the brute, till that which began in a high resolve ends in the fury of maddening hate! The pain, the torture, the hot blood urges on the animal instincts of cruelty and vengeance. No quarter was asked, none was given,-to the death they fought.</p> 
               <p>And still over the heaps of their dead comrades these trained veterans moved on; but now no powder flashed across their faces, no whizzing ball flew by their ears; even the cannon's roar had ceased, but the pike, the bludgeon, the strong arm, were there to meet them as they ascended. Yet what were these against the fresh relays of troops pouring in? Ammunition exhausted, ranks decimated, they were at last compelled to retreat, so that when the victors finally reached the heights there remained to meet them only the heaps of slain. All who survived the fight had fled to the mountains.<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC5593-00000174"/> Still in hot pursuit, the troops followed; but once in their fastnesses those that knew them well were able to make good their escape.</p> 
               <p>Fearful, sickening was the suspense on that dreadful day. I could hear the sullen boom of the cannon, hour after hour, and every sound brought with it the horror of death and suffering. Oh! my poor father and Walter! I knew they were there. Oh! this agonizing suspense; at one moment hope, the next despair!</p> 
               <p>I went out into the grounds, through the outhouses, the fields; not a living creature was to be seen,-all were gone. I returned to the cottage, and straining my eyes up and down the road kept incessant watch, and if a chance wanderer came near I rushed to him to beg for some word, some news of the contest; but none knew aught, like me they were stunned and bewildered.</p> 
               <p>The day which, in its early rising, had been clear and sunny, closed dark and cloudy. A heavy mist was falling. I suppose this added to my despair; a terrible longing came over me. I would go to the battle-field; I must search for them; I might save them yet. Would not Walter do this for me? Yes, and a thousand times more for me and for my poor father.</p> 
               <p>No sooner had I resolved on this than I told Betty. "Oh Lord, miss, go among the dead people?" was her cry.</p> 
               <p>"And you will go with me?"</p> 
               <p>"No, no, it would kill me; I would die first."</p> 
               <p>"Then I will go alone," I said.</p> 
               <p>But Betty's tender heart could not bear that; she would accompany me. "And we may be of use-and how strong it will make us feel," I urged, "if we can,<pb n=""/> even with a drop of water, relieve some poor sufferer; and you will not be frightened,-I know you will not,-when you are doing such a good work, Betty."</p> 
               <p>Quickly we traversed the lonely road. I felt no fatigue or terror as we hurried on, urged by an impelling force which made us forget ourselves.</p> 
               <p>The terrible details of that night, the weary search among the dead and dying, are too painful to dwell upon. Many besides ourselves were there on a similar errand, silently, or with suppressed sighs, searching for their loved ones. Little was there upon that battle-field to tempt cupidity; many of those who had fallen were in their peasant dress, poor men, who had left their cottages, or their field-work, that very morning to swell the ranks of the insurgents.</p> 
               <p>Those whom we were seeking were not there, but one we had not looked for was. As we were about relinquishing our hopeless task, and turning wearily from the search, I saw a body lying somewhat in advance of a heap of slain who had evidently fallen in defending the flag which still fluttered above them, its standard erect. I thought I knew the great shock head, as, holding my lantern low to the ground, I approached. The face was downward. We gently turned the body, and there lay poor Tim. Alas, poor Tim!</p> 
               <p>He was still alive. We bathed the face and hands, all clotted with blood; we gave him a little wine. He revived, he opened his eyes. I bent over him and whispered, "Do you know me, Tim?" There was no reply. I repeated the question, whispering it as I smoothed away the hair from his forehead. A gleam<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC5593-00000175"/> of intelligence passed over the white face: he recognized the voice. "Miss Olive!" he said feebly, "God forever bless you."</p> 
               <p>"What can I do for you, Tim, anything on earth?" I said, much affected. "Tell me, Tim."</p> 
               <p>He shook his head, pressing his hand upon his breast; a torrent of blood flowed from his lips. I thought for a moment that he was gone; but, lifting him up, we moistened his lips with wine, and he rallied.</p> 
               <p>The short night was now passing into day, and the dawn lit up gently the face of poor Tim. He looked directly at me, a wild gleam in his eye.</p> 
               <p>"Miss Olive, by jabers, the boys done well! Now at them!" he cried, exultantly. "Where is it?" groping about him as if for the old fife. There, sure enough, it lay on the blood-wet grass beneath him. "Now, boys, to the charge!" and putting the fife to his lips, he sent forth a shrill and wailing peal. It was the last; the well-worn instrument fell from his lips, his head sunk back on Betty's shoulder. "Master Walter!" he muttered.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Tim," I cried, "tell me of him. Where is he? Where is my father?"</p> 
               <p>He strove to speak, but could not; a gurgling sound came from his lips, he pointed as if afar off, a spasm passed over his face, and a strange silence followed. Tim had passed away. With all his wild, untutored enthusiasm, his native genius, his good heart, Tim had served his country to his very best ability, and I wept as we laid him carefully down, straightened the limbs and smoothed the wan face. He looked placid, almost smiling; for him the battle was over.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>I had overtaxed my strength, and the next day lay, through many weary hours, in the stupor which follows intense exhaustion. Towards night, Betty insisted that I should have some tea. It was a lonely meal, and when it was removed I sat in the window looking out through the shadowy twilight across the open lawn towards the old Hall; from here the grand portico, with its great granite pillars, was distinctly seen, unobstructed by leafy avenue and branching shade-tree. The dream of my childhood came back to me as I looked; the day-dream, when its distant grandeur had loomed through my grandmother's lattice, unapproachable, splendid as a vision. I had looked in the face of my dream since then, and its glory had vanished in sadness and tears.</p> 
               <p>In these months, as I have stated, twilight with us almost merges into night, and I sat absorbed, watching the changing light, and growing soothed and calm in the serene atmosphere about us. Presently I saw a form approaching; it came nearer; I recognized it now with a beating heart, the tall, slight figure, the graceful motions were not unfamiliar to my eyes. Could it be that Arthur was coming to the lodge?</p> 
               <p>In a few moments he had opened the door and stood before me unannounced.</p> 
               <p>"I have come to say good-by, Olive," he said, holding out his hand, "and to tell you something more. You know you have been so long my sister, that I owe you this much-this much of confidence."</p> 
               <p>He spoke all this hurriedly, as if it had been a lesson conned over before he entered. The manner wounded me, but it also gave me unusual self-possession. I<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC5593-00000176"/> pointed to a chair, saying, as he seated himself, "Ah, you are going to leave, then?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, we are leaving for London; my poor mother's nerves are so perfectly unstrung by all that has happened, and by the present excitement, that she fears her mind will become utterly unhinged if she remains. My father will not accompany her, so I must do so. Adele will be with us."</p> 
               <p>"Of course," I said coolly, and added, "it is the best thing you can do, Arthur; you ought to go. Shall I not see Lady Grace before she leaves?"</p> 
               <p>"I fear not; we start at midnight."</p> 
               <p>"Then give her my dearest, kindest love, Arthur. And pray, what is that other something you were to tell me?" I said, after a long pause, dreading, yet knowing what was coming.</p> 
               <p>"Adele and myself are-engaged to be married."</p> 
               <p>He uttered the words with apparent difficulty, wiping the perspiration from his forehead as he continued, in a low voice, "I have told my mother, I have told Adele, that I must inform you of this myself."</p> 
               <p>I was glad that the shadows closed so darkly around us. A clearer light might have revealed the blanched face, the falling tears, with which I listened. I had looked for it, but the realization was sore. It seemed to be another severing from home, and Florence, and all that was left me of youth and happiness.</p> 
               <p>I said, however, with apparent calmness, "I had expected this."</p> 
               <p>"Had you? Still I do not hear a word of congratulation." Then speaking in a quick, hard tone, he added, "It is hard, when one has done a thing which<pb n=""/> will affect their whole life, very hard when those we love hear of it coldly, and have not a word of cheer."</p> 
               <p>Almost forgetting my imposed restraint, I cried, impulsively, "Oh, Arthur, you must know how much I would rejoice in your happiness."</p> 
               <p>He drew a little closer to me as he said, "Yes, Olive, we have been very dear friends; I know well your many fine qualities, and if you had not so-so"-he stopped.</p> 
               <p>"So what?" I asked.</p> 
               <p>"So deceived me."</p> 
               <p>Should I now tell him all I knew? Vindicate myself in his eyes at once and forever, and chill, at one blow, the hopes of the expectant bride? It was a strong temptation, but I resisted it. I knew that I would be destroying the hopes of his mother, the expectations of his father, whom I loved as my own, and whose ancient name would be sullied by an alliance between his only son and a peasant girl; an alliance whose effect that son would not, in all his life, have manliness or strength to overcome. My sense of right triumphed; I refrained my lips from speaking; but it was a struggle. Henceforth he would live on with a mistaken, a miserably mistaken conception of my character. I should be remembered only as a deceiver, while the real criminal sat by his side triumphant. I only answered, "I never purposely deceived you, my dear friend."</p> 
               <p>He saw that I was deeply affected; he urged no more that I should congratulate him, but said, in a low, agitated voice,-</p> 
               <p>"Would Florence have liked what I have done?"</p> 
               <pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC5593-00000177"/> 
               <p>I could not even answer this question. My lips were sealed. Perhaps he was satisfied that it should be so, or feared the result of any communicativeness on my part. He rose to depart, but lingered still a moment.</p> 
               <p>"You will be lonely here," he said.</p> 
               <p>His feelings, for the moment, seemed getting the mastery of him; but I answered cheerfully,-</p> 
               <p>"Not at all. When you are all away, I shall be a great part of the time with Sir Robert at the Hall."</p> 
               <p>"That's a good girl." He had still something more to say, it appeared. He took my hand in his. "Do you know that Walter has made himself quite famous in these disastrous skirmishes we have had? He is a noble fellow. There is none other in the world to whom I would resign you, Olive. Would to God it were not so hard-so hard."</p> 
               <p>His voice quivered. He grasped my hand, in a long, lingering clasp, till it thrilled with the pressure, then suddenly dropping it, he was gone.</p> 
               <p>And I was alone. In all the world, where could I look for protection? Oh, it is hard to feel like some stray, forgotten thing, with no one to love, no one to care for! For a moment a feeling like despair overwhelmed me. But I felt ashamed of my selfish ingratitude, when another voice sounded on the threshhold, and another familiar step entered the room.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Massarene; dear Mr. Massarene! You come like an angel to save me! I am so lonely, so lost!"</p> 
               <p>He smiled upon me with a beaming, kindly glance; he cheered me with comforting and manly words; there was strength in his very presence.</p> 
               <p>I did not know until then that he, with a few others<pb n=""/> of the suspected gentry, had been arrested, but had been released on the eve of the battle; it being hoped that their influence, which had always been opposed to the premature use of arms, might prevail to bring about a surrender on favorable terms. Neither did I know that his sister Annastene was dead. She had died quite suddenly at last, seated in her chair, and on the same day that had witnessed the death of our sweet Florence.</p> 
               <p>"And we are both alone," he said; adding, with a deep sigh, yes, my poor child, I have sad news for you."</p> 
               <p>"Tell me!" was my cry. "Do not spare me, my friend. Is it my father,-is it Walter?"</p> 
               <p>"Not Walter. Your father-"</p> 
               <p>"Is he wounded? Oh, can I not go to him?"</p> 
               <p>"Now let me say it all, poor child. It is best that you should know the whole truth at once. Your father was taken with arms upon him; a court-martial was called without delay; he was sentenced, and-"</p> 
               <p>"Shot!" I cried, rising in my excitement and horror. "I know it, I feel it! You need not spare me any dreadful tidings. Long, long have I dreaded the worst."</p> 
               <p>I wrung my hands as I said it; it seemed to me that the world itself was passing from under my feet.</p> 
               <p>"He is dead," was the low response. "I used my utmost endeavors to save him; but I only gained the poor favor of a few words with him. He was calm, heroic, Olive, as I expect you to be. His only solicitude was for his daughter. I promised that no harm should come to you, and he was satisfied."</p> 
               <pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC5593-00000178"/> 
               <p>A burst of uncontrollable grief overwhelmed me at this certainty of all that I had dimly feared.</p> 
               <p>This good friend allowed me to wail out my grief; with kindest patience he listened to my lamentations until they had exhausted themselves; and when a calm succeeded this outcry of anguish, he took my weak hand in his strong protecting one, as he said,-</p> 
               <p>"Now listen, dear child,-for you have long been dear to me, dear as my own life,-I have something to say to you that concerns us both. I am, no doubt, what you will call old, and perhaps I am so," he added, with a smile; "but, as I said, we are both alone; and, even at my age, I can protect you in but one way. And now, Olive, will you give me the right to protect and cherish you? Will you-dare I ask it-will you be an old man's bride?"</p> 
               <p>I was so utterly taken by surprise that I could not utter a word. It was not of his age I was thinking. I was overwhelmed that Mr. Massarene, so immeasurably above me, so superior in my eyes to all others, should use such words to me.</p> 
               <p>So long I pondered in my amazement, that he at length said, rather sadly, "I understand, Olive. It is natural that such an idea should be repugnant to you."</p> 
               <p>"No, no, my friend," I said, still clinging to the hand he was withdrawing from me, "it is not that-it is-it is-." After many attempts and many failures, I at length made him understand the thought that was in my mind.</p> 
               <p>"And is this all? Perhaps I ask too much-but would my good child deal frankly with me-open her mind to me? Has she any secret hopes, longing desires,<pb n=""/> loves or ambitions? Tell me all; begin at the very beginning. You will find me neither an exacting nor a severe listener. If I cannot have your love myself, I will try to make happy him whom you prefer, Olive; for my love is not a selfish one."</p> 
               <p>And I did tell him all, even from the very beginning to the last words of my interview with Arthur. "I <emph>have</emph> loved him," I said, with downcast eyes, "but that is over now. Everything that I love, everything that I respect in myself, calls upon me to be done with the infatuation. It has been an infatuation. The feeling I had for Arthur was not founded on anything I could respect or honor."</p> 
               <p>"Bravely said, Olive. I would not fear to trust my future peace of mind with such a spirit. Now, Olive," and he raised my hand to his lips, "may I ratify this treaty? Speak, dearest, best beloved."</p> 
               <p>My head rested upon his shoulder in blessed peace and trust. I was no longer alone. The tears which I shed for my dead were wiped by a friendly hand. Love was around me; love that would one day bring my life back to its old happy ways. Florence seemed near me, with her violet eyes; my father's spirit seemed to smile upon me blessed and at peace.</p> 
               <p>We talked long of our plans, or rather Mr. Massarene's plans; and, as we talked, we heard the rattle of the carriage wheels which bore the Greytons out of the lodge gate. It was midnight; Arthur had passed out of my life forever; in that moment I forgave him his misconception, his selfishness; all that he had been to me of woe or joy was at an end.</p> 
               <p>The rebellion Mr. Massarene regarded as now virtually<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC5593-00000179"/> tually at a close-though its final results could not as be yet foreseen; but some weeks must elapse before his affairs could be arranged. Then we would be quietly married; after which we would spend a year abroad, or perhaps longer. The gossip and wonder over the marriage would by that time be over, and we should return to live on the estate. In the mean time there was to be nothing said about it. He would drop in every day to see me, "and make sure," he added, smiling, "that my bird has not flown."</p> 
               <p>The hours now passed as minutes. For after the first shock of my father's death, I could not allow myself to feel despondency for him. He had died a hero's death, the death he would have chosen beyond all others; his name was enrolled among those who had served their country with their best blood-who should say whether wisely or unwisely?</p> 
               <p>Every day I was with Sir Robert; I read to him; I talked to him; we walked together through the park and grounds. Sometimes we sat in Florence's room and talked of her. She almost seemed to be present with us at such times; but the sweet illusion vanished in deeper gloom and silence after these hours of remembrance. Her father seemed to dwell upon her memory; to revert to her pretty, childlike ways, her innocent, angel-like purity of thought, with a tenderness deeper perhaps than he had felt for her in life. The coming daughter who was to fill her place was never alluded to.</p> 
               <p>Poor Sir Robert, he seemed so utterly crushed and broken down! Would he ever be again as he had been?</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">CONCLUSION.</head> 
               <p>THE war was over; the fearful outbreak so long dreaded, so fatal in its course, was crushed forever. Twenty thousand of the king's troops, and fifty thousand of the people, had perished during the period covered by this most disastrous rebellion.</p> 
               <p>Describing this time of desolation, a writer says: "The blast of the bugle now called home the pursuing legions. Peace was again in the land. Seven weeks had passed, and what a change! A hurricane had swept across the land. Now the air was still, but everywhere the eye saw marks of that desolating track. Many a village was in ashes; fighting was ended, but weeping remained. Sobs were heard from many a lowly cot. Sons and daughters were gone; the spring saw them full of lusty life, the midsummer saw them scattered like autumn leaves. Now their cabins were more desolate than ever. Many a father came not back from the war. The peasant wife, whose true, loving heart led her at night to the field of the unburied slain, recognized, with his face upturned to the moon, the cold clay of him whom she had followed through scenes of poverty and woe. But melancholy as were many scenes of this disastrous war, sad as was its issue, none can deny to those who took up arms that they<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC5593-00000180"/> had many wrongs, and that they fought with a bravery worthy of men struggling for their freedom."</p> 
               <p>The government, now seemingly satisfied with its victory, was disposed to mercy. A proclamation of universal amnesty was published to those who would at once lay down their arms; the only exceptions to the general pardon were those who had been the prominent abettors and leaders of the insurrection.</p> 
               <p>Of course Walter came under this head. He, with those that were left on that fatal day, had fled to the mountains, and was holding out successfully against the pursuing foe; but it was understood to be a desperate game. Their total subjection was but a question of time. Mr. Massarene and others were anxious to save the brave fellows, and used every means to induce them to accept the amnesty. "And be banished our country forever!" they cried, "no, rather let us die and moisten with our blood the dear old soil."</p> 
               <p>But at last the persuasions of those they could not but admit were their wisest friends induced them to submit, though not without many a tear and bitter sigh wrung from their hardy hearts.</p> 
               <p>Through Mr. Massarene's persistent influence, Walter was enabled to choose his place of exile. He chose America, the new world, that had always been his ambition, the great centre of his ideas of true liberty.</p> 
               <p>As a great act of clemency also, he was permitted to visit the old home before he left. He came to the lodge under guard of two officers of the law. I had desired to see him, and Mr. Massarene, with his usual trustfulness, left us together in the brief half-hour allotted to us. Walter knew I was to be Mr. Massarene's<pb n=""/> rene's wife, and I think he was quite relieved by the announcement. "Arthur is not worthy of you, Olive," he said, his face flushed with emotion, "and-and this other is."</p> 
               <p>"You are still hard on Arthur, Walter; do not speak in this way."</p> 
               <p>"I cannot help it. You know I never admired him; and now that he has proved a dastard, a recreant to his country, leaving it in its utmost need, I cannot,-I cannot but despise him."</p> 
               <p>Something of my old spirit now rose; I could not bear these hard words. "Do not say dastard," I urged. "He loves his country, I know he does; but he has not your free spirit, Walter, your clear, determined will; he is swayed by circumstances, influenced by those immediately around him. His heart is good, his instincts are right. I think we might rather pity than blame him."</p> 
               <p>"Pity!" he repeated, with something of a dash of scorn, but added quickly, with almost a smile, "At our old subject of quarrel; and I think now," looking at the two men pacing up and down in front of the door, "we have hardly time to waste on this disputed question. I wish I could see him as you do,-I owe the family much,-but I cannot. And now, before we part, yes, part forever, tell me-tell me of yourself, Olive."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, not forever, Walter!" I cried, feeling sick at heart. Walter was very dear to me. His uniform tenderness and affection, ever since my earliest recollections, his many and continued benefits to myself and those that I loved, crowded on my memory, and I felt sore indeed.</p> 
               <pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC5593-00000181"/> 
               <p>We sat down in that little home room, so teeming with recollections, while I told him all about my grandmother, her sickness and death, and how glad I was that she was saved the knowledge of his going away, and joining in what would have seemed to her a most unrighteous conspiracy against established authority. Her strong heart was spared this pang, at least. "Walter will soon be here," had been her hopeful and confident assertion to the last.</p> 
               <p>And Walter wept bitterly to have disappointed the faith of one who had always been as a mother to him. Then we talked of Florence, and my heart poured out its incurable sorrow; her beauty, her sweetness came up for remembrance in this hour of parting, and Walter sympathized with me in that loss which could never be replaced in this world. So long we talked that the men without gave symptoms of impatience; the allotted time was passed. Walter rose and offered me his hand for the last farewell. "I thank you, Olive, I shall never cease to thank you," he said, with emotion.</p> 
               <p>"Thank me?" I repeated. "What have I done worthy of thanks, Walter?"</p> 
               <p>"If there be anything in me worthy your regard or regret, Olive, I owe it to you. You have been the angel to lure me on to a higher and better life. I know what you would say, Olive; do not fear me now, my hopes and dreams are over. But you will still be my stimulus, and the secret spring of my ambition. I will strive to render myself worthy of your friendship, and to do honor to your partial judgment."</p> 
               <p>"I know you will," I said, with a sob I could not<pb n=""/> suppress. "I never expect to hear of you but as one of whom we may all be proud."</p> 
               <p>In a few weeks Mr. Massarene and myself were quietly married. He, so disinterested in his love for me, did not, after all, have to receive a dowerless bride. Lady Betty was dead, and in a will executed about a year before her death left me all she possessed, with the exception of a few legacies to old servants and dependents.</p> 
               <p>How strange it seemed that I should have been chosen for her heir! There were Arthur and Florence,-and Florence she loved so much more; but the dear old lady, ever eccentric, acting from her own convictions, no doubt thought of their abundance and my dependence, and acted from these ideas of fitness. And from the kind words in which her last desires were expressed, I learned she had loved me more than I thought.</p> 
               <p>I tried to think what I could have done to so gain her esteem. I remembered that I alone of the three had applied myself studiously to master her native language, so inexpressibly dear to her. She had taught me all I knew of it, and together we had read much of its wild romance, the legends of its cherished greatness, its now departed glory, and with a kindling enthusiasm almost equal to her own, I had been carried away to imaginations even more visionary and wild than those her beloved ancient bards and chroniclers indulged in. This had, no doubt, endeared me to her; I had seemed as the child of her intellect, and in her last will she had acknowledged me as such.</p> 
               <p>After our marriage we left Ireland for a year's travel<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC5593-00000182"/> abroad. That year was among the most blessed and beautiful of my life. Daily I learned to honor and love and reverence my husband more and more. I forgot the disparity in our years. He was to me all that my heart had craved. I was proud to be his wife, and my great strife was to attain in reality the height upon which his affections had placed me. He must not learn to blush for his young and thoughtless bride.</p> 
               <p>During our absence, Dark Cliff-or rather the Cliff Manor, its proper name-was carefully and thoroughly renovated. It was to be our future home. The close, stunted trees on the lawn were cleared away, only a few less exposed to the sea-air being retained. The high wall inclosing the grounds was taken down, and light and sunshine once more danced on turret and tower, casting their shadows over the rich greensward, down the terraced banks, even to the rocks and sands of the broad, open beach below.</p> 
               <p>The ancient mansion, stained by centuries of sea-blasts, also underwent strange transformation; its walls were rubbed and scraped until the rough white stone beneath revealed itself in its original purity. A new wing was added, and a tower; and our home, the old Dark Cliff, shone out again in its original attractiveness, a tasteful and elegant pile, visible afar off as you approached from sea, and to those who dwelt within it a home of joy and comfort.</p> 
               <p>We found many changes on our return. Sir Robert had passed away, and Sir Arthur and Lady Adele presided at the Hall. Lady Grace resided with them; she was painfully changed. She met me with unwonted demonstrations of affection; it was evident she was<pb n=""/> not happy at the Hall. Things were sadly changed there. It had now a mistress who lived and ruled for herself alone. "My poor Arthur," Lady Grace would say, "is all that a son can be, but-but-" She would shake her head, while a tear trembled in her eye, "but-but-how changed that home!" Before long she became an inmate of our household, withdrawing gratefully from that where the daughter of her choice resided.</p> 
               <p>We were now, my husband and myself, recognized as the Earl and Countess of --. In his early youth, discouraged by the political state of the country, and unambitious of the distinctions of rank, Mr. Massarene had laid aside his title. Now, he said, smiling, he would bestow on me all honor which the world regarded as such, and he resumed the discarded bauble of an earldom with as little affectation as he had resigned it.</p> 
               <p>We often met Sir Arthur and Lady Adele in public; and if taking precedence by right of rank was any satisfaction for early taunts and jeers, I had that satisfaction. Once, doubtless, this would have gratified a certain pride of spirit, a certain desire for "justice," inherent in my nature; but I have higher aspirations now, or perhaps in my husband's love I have forgotten some early griefs.</p> 
               <p>Yet I never go to the old Hall; I do not care to renew its old associations, or to see the haunts, held sacred in my memory, changed and adapted to new uses. I keep the memory of Florence fragrant and holy. I have no need to renew it by visiting the scene of our youthful friendship; I will not pain myself nor wrong<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC5593-00000183"/> her by attempting polite amenities, social courtesies, with one who had no place in her esteem.</p> 
               <p>In time my husband once more began to take interest in the affairs of his country. This he declared was rather to please his wife (whom he often rallies on her political tendencies), than from any hope that individual effort could avail much against the vast combination of political machinery, the league of political leaders whose interests and energies were devoted to the establishment of the "Union," as it was termed-the union of Ireland and England under one common government. In time this union was accomplished, as such unions are wont to be accomplished, by the complete paralysis of the weaker party. The labors of Ireland's patriots to give their country its own laws, its own rights of commerce, were ranked among the futile efforts that sadden the pages of history. The stream of wealth and influence was diverted from our capital to swell the pride of England and the coffers of London. The butterflies of fashion, the innumerable crowd that ever flutter in the sunshine wherever it be, the followers of the court, the minions of the government, all drifted away with the vanishing prosperity. Costly mansions were deserted, whole streets were left unoccupied, ranges of brilliant shops filled with rare goods stood deserted. No crowds of customers, no gay concourse of wealth and fashion, enlivened their dreary inactivity. Worse still than all this, the country gentlemen and the landed proprietors left their estates to be managed by agents, or by any one who would undertake to drain from them the money necessary to support them splendidly in their new homes.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>But still we hope on; we know that where there is vitality there must be ultimate recovery; the national character is strong in recuperative power; centuries may elapse with perhaps little apparent change, and with often much seeming retrogression, but hope still points triumphantly to the future, when political, religious, and traditional thraldom shall be done away, when governments shall be ordained for the best interests of those who sustain them, when individual rights shall no longer clash with the rights of communities, and justice and mercy shall prevail, freedom and toleration exist in reality as well as in name.</p>

                  <p>"The Quaker character, though its quaintness and simplicity may seem easy enough to catch, requires a delicate workman to do it justice.

                  <p>"The author of 'Misunderstood' has given us another charming story of child-life. This, however, is not a book for children.

                  <p>"A delightful story, founded upon the lives of children. There is a thread of gold in it upon which are strung many lovely sentiments. There is a deep and strong current of religious feeling throughout the story, not a prosy, unattractive lecturing upon religious subjects. A good, true and earnest life is depicted, full of hope and longing, and of happy fruition.

                  <p>"Mrs. Wister's admirable translations are among the books that everybody reads. She certainly may be said to possess unusual ability in retaining the peculiar weird flavor of a German story, while rendering it with perfect ease and grace into our own language. Few recently published novels have received more general perusal and approval than 'Only a Girl;' and 'Why Did He Not Die?' possesses in at least an equal degree all the elements of popularity. From the beginning to the end the interest never flags, and the characters and scenes are drawn with great warmth and power."-New York Herald.</p>
