PREFACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
READER, in this the eighty-fifth year of American Independence,&#xD;
we are suffering from the terrible effects of the greatest and most&#xD;
fearful crisis through which this nation has ever passed; a crisis&#xD;
induced perhaps by several causes, but chiefly, all will admit, by&#xD;
that base bone of continual contention-" Southren Slavery;" be-&#xD;
neath the 'final. cultination,-of the angry agitation of which the&#xD;
nation has raved, and reeled, and staggered like a. strong giant&#xD;
drunk, with very madness; aye macdness in the disunion fiend has&#xD;
ruled. already, too long;, and the insane convulsions aiid internal&#xD;
throes of republican liberty-the hope of the world-have been;&#xD;
during the fiery ordeal, indeed fearfully severe and painful.&#xD;
How careful then will be the man who has the welfare of his&#xD;
dear country at heart,- that by any meanshe does not add greater&#xD;
distraction to the dangers already quite, sufficient for the govern-&#xD;
ment safely to bear.  That by theoretic speculation merely on a&#xD;
subject that has already proved.a sword to separate very friend,&#xD;
he doesnot add still greater distraction to her distress.  It is with&#xD;
this care, this innate feeling of regard for the lasting welfare of&#xD;
our own native-land, that we have penned the history of strange&#xD;
vicissitudes, suffering, 'and wrong, as, comprised on the pages of the&#xD;
White Slave;-which, indeed, is no ideal dream; no fanatical&#xD;
phantorp of a speculative theory; but the careful words of sober,&#xD;
serious, and substantial truth, shaded and'tinged indeed at inter-&#xD;
vals with the roseate coloring of the seeming improbabilities of&#xD;
romance though they be. Yet we flatter ourselves, that if'calmly&#xD;
.  ulled, they will shadow forth at -least one of the 'several causes&#xD;
of our national domestic difficulties.&#xD;
Juan Mendeza   met with at the state capitol of South Carolina,&#xD;
Columbia,.where he,-unsolicited, revealed to me the fact that he&#xD;
was a natural born slave, which surprised me beyond measure, for&#xD;
he was a fine, intelligent looking man, of about twenty-four years&#xD;
of agie,  with hair dark, quite straight, and less' curling than my&#xD;
&#xD;
*1'.&#xD;

own; features as regular and of the Italian cast; and skin as fair,&#xD;
as white as the purest Caucasion.&#xD;
. I could not at first believe that a man so white, and of such fair,&#xD;
beautiful proportions, could be retained in bondage under the free&#xD;
government of Anierica, even though born a slave; and when I&#xD;
expressed my doubts of his African lineage, he grew quite excited;&#xD;
starting forward with considerable warmth, he hissed:&#xD;
"Look into my eyes."&#xD;
"Well,--" said I, calmly, after contemplating them a moment.&#xD;
"Do you not observe the bluish tinge through the whites of&#xD;
them ?"&#xD;
"Very slightly-" I answered, musingly, and with an inclination&#xD;
to impart, if I could, some word of encouragement to the poor serf.&#xD;
"And look at my hand, see that fearful color marking, though&#xD;
faintly, the root of each nail of my fingers, 'tis but a slight tinge,&#xD;
but alas, the mark though it be occasioned by but a single drop of&#xD;
African blood, is sufficiently indellible .to prove fatal. Though I&#xD;
be seven-eighths tviAte, of the purest Caucasion, and oneighth&#xD;
African, yet anjIexcluded from all affinity with my white brothers,&#xD;
impaled with the aown-trodden sons of the negro race- and com-&#xD;
pelled to remain a slave."&#xD;
And as hecontinued to recoitto me the bitter wrongs he' en-&#xD;
lured, vehemently vowing with upliftfed hands, that if ever he en-&#xD;
countered the author of his cruel destiny, he would certain as-&#xD;
sassinate him. Though my soul recoiled at the sound of the seem-&#xD;
ing unnatural vow of parricidal vengeance, yet I could not sup-&#xD;
press the train of' new thoughts the fearful oath suggested,"'and in&#xD;
spite of myself, grew deeply interested in the wronged and 'justly&#xD;
excited slave..&#xD;
And so, without the least extenuation of malice, have I written&#xD;
out the history of his bitter life, in unison with the spirit of the&#xD;
.story as I received it from his own lips. Hoping therefore it may&#xD;
exert a due share of influence in correcting, if possible, our na-&#xD;
tional fault; and that, by the voluntary and peaceable avoidance&#xD;
of it altogether, finally avert the sure and terrible consequences&#xD;
of crime that' as a nation we may forever remain the favored of&#xD;
heaven, the hope and glory of all lands, I dedicate to the cause&#xD;
of public morals the conservative lesson inculcated in the faithful&#xD;
history of the WHIT SLAVE,&#xD;

"the Theatre was crowded from pit to dome," yet the Parquette,&#xD;
family and dress circle and boxes, were filled with the "Elite 'and&#xD;
Fashion" of Philadelphia. Juan was youthful, scarce thirty years&#xD;
of age, but of ripe and elegant proportions, he was tall and manly,&#xD;
person regularly and classically developed; his features pf the purest&#xD;
[tallian mould,with eyes of glassy jet that in their dazzling seemed&#xD;

Among the charmed audience there was one, who, envious of his&#xD;
passion, thought him in truth, in love with the beautiful Cecelia, and&#xD;
while with her parents she admired his lofty eloquence, she longed&#xD;
for the blissful moment when from the depth of his full soul, and alone&#xD;
lie would breathe in her willing ear-the same impassioned sentiments&#xD;
of self-sacrificing love. She was the favorite daughter of Antonio&#xD;
Capello, a man of wealth and aristocratic ease, and of Spanish A mer-&#xD;
ican birth. Having accumulated a good degree of wealth in the land&#xD;
where cruel magnificence, slavery and misery seem twin born, he&#xD;
now lived in Philadelphia a retired gentleman. His daughter the&#xD;
beautiful Beatrice was beloved not only for her beauty, but also her&#xD;
oodness of heart, and man  excellencies of mind and character.&#xD;
She was young and surroundd with almost Queenly wealth, with&#xD;
everything to attract and  lease. She was courted, flattered and&#xD;
carressed by the noblest of e land.&#xD;
It was late at night, and the streets of the city were well nigh&#xD;
aeserted, silence prevailed, save at intervals, when a hasty carriage or&#xD;
iaise rattled over the pavement, and the quick footstep of an&#xD;
o  assional passenger fell upon the ear. The theatres and other&#xD;
pla es of amusement were closed for the night, and the swal'ms of&#xD;
plea ure-seeker's which they poured forth had time to reach their&#xD;
- om s,&#xD;
The select soiree of the proud Beatrice Capello had passed pleas .&#xD;
antly away, and the favored few,,who had been admitted to net&#xD;
society, were n6w taking their leave of her one by one, and sauntering&#xD;
into tie streets. Two alone lingered after the rest had gone, an&#xD;
these were among the most favored guests of Signor Antonio Capello&#xD;
and -his lovely daughter.&#xD;
Sinclai lJuval ad long been intimate with the family to which&#xD;
he had some time before introduced Juan, his bosom friend; and as&#xD;
Sinclair was held ih high estimationby both Beatrice and her father,&#xD;
Juan, for his friend's sake, was'regarded rather as an old acquaintance&#xD;
*than' one whom the scarcely knew.&#xD;
The two friends in ered after the rest had gone, but they too, at&#xD;
last took their leave, ind arm in arm.sauntered along the street. To&#xD;
have seen them, one would not have recognized in their thoughtful&#xD;
features, the two gay young rmen who an hour before attracted the&#xD;
attention of the entire party, by- their elegant address, ready and&#xD;
sparkling wit., Juan had.appeared.that evening in the characterof,&#xD;
- Othello," and he may have been fatigued, or was now relapsing&#xD;
into the strange cilmsucceeding his almost unapproachable person.&#xD;
ification of the loving though jealous, moor. It was -one of his&#xD;
happiest efforts. Flowers and boquets greeted him from the elite&#xD;
and fashion occupying .the, dress cicle and boxes. But now his&#xD;
gayety had passed away, and a sort-of pleasing seriousness possessed&#xD;
the heart of Juan and his friend.&#xD;
"Othello's active occupation seemed really to be gone. For soe&#xD;
tin neither spoke but walked on in silence all abused in their own&#xD;
-reflectigns.&#xD;

I&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
aWhat ails you Juan?" At length spoke Sinclair, breaking iM&#xD;
upon his friend's meditations.&#xD;
 "I was thinking," Juan replied with a smile.&#xD;
"Very probably, for I believe that every rational being thinks,&#xD;
but may I ask what weighs upon your mind, giving to your every&#xD;
look and action a tinge of melancholy."&#xD;
Well really Sinclair, I scarcely know myself. But somehow&#xD;
the look which our friend Capello gAve me, as I took my leave, calls&#xD;
up early associations, and it seems to me,-that I have seen his-face&#xD;
before."&#xD;
"Indeed!"&#xD;
"1Yes Sinclair, it is even so; although when or where, I cannot&#xD;
tell. It must have been many years ago, however-perhaps when I&#xD;
was-a poor forsakein orphan."&#xD;
"!Juan, Juan, tell me about that, when you were tho orphan you&#xD;
have so often mentioned in my hearing."&#xD;
"Not to-night, Sinclair, if you please," said Juan shaking his&#xD;
- head sadly,. "for the recollections Capello's strange look called up&#xD;
are ssad enough without recuring to the details of my earl history;&#xD;
you know that I am an orphan-but the wrongs I endured, the wrongs&#xD;
which killed my mother, and which I have since sworn to revenge.&#xD;
if heaven has not saved me the- task-you know nothing of them&#xD;
Sinclair, and I hope you never will."&#xD;
"Pardon me Juan for (fuestioning you, I was not aware of the&#xD;
deep wounds on your bosom, and am sorry to make you sadder than&#xD;
before."&#xD;
"Yes, yes," Juan exclaimed vehemently, "I am -sad, and unless I&#xD;
seek some stirring scene, some powerful excitement, the melancholy&#xD;
of this night will stay by me for days. ItAis what I cannot shake off&#xD;
without assistance."&#xD;
"Then I will remain with you Juan; and we ,will seek some&#xD;
diversiontogether, and I will help youto get rid of your melancholy&#xD;
thoughts."&#xD;
"Thanks, good Sinclair; but what do you propose?"&#xD;
"You are fond of play?"&#xD;
"It is an amusement, although I seldom play for money, except&#xD;
though courtesy."&#xD;
"I know Juan. But the game alone excites you. If you woulJ&#xD;
forget your own thoughts, you cpuld do no better than spend the&#xD;
-     remainder of the night-or at least a part of it at-P-ll-r's. The&#xD;
company there is always of the first class, the players generous, ant&#xD;
the wine superb. What do you say I"&#xD;
"I accept your proposition;" Juan replied quickening his step&#xD;

. CHAPTER 1.1&#xD;
TE GAMXSTEIS.&#xD;
. Twerty minutes more broug*t our two friends to o'0e of the most&#xD;
%ashionable gaming Saloons o Philadelphia. And though the hour&#xD;
was late, there was a large number- engaged at play. Spanish and&#xD;
Itallian amateures, Englis sportsmen, and German spectators, were&#xD;
mingled with American dandies, black legs and artists. All appeared&#xD;
upon the same footing there, all moved by one common impul, the&#xD;
passion for gaming. Juan was soon engaged with an experienced&#xD;
player named Livingston, while Sinclair together with several stran-&#xD;
gers stood by, watching the progress of the game.&#xD;
Although but a moderate player, yet Juan was unusually skillful&#xD;
at cards, bein quick at observation, and accustomed to all thetricks&#xD;
of the age.  n the resent occasion, however he had his match..&#xD;
His adversary played with great coolness and precision, turning his&#xD;
wholeattention to the game.' Juanat-first played carelessly, butnghen&#xD;
game aner game closed in favor of his adversary, he began to pay&#xD;
more attention, though he played with the same coolness as before.&#xD;
His fortune, however did not charge. Livingston continued to win&#xD;
from him until he had but a' single bill left in his pocket. This .Juan&#xD;
staked, played for, and lost.I&#xD;
"6Lawrence Livingston," he exbaaimed fyou are inluck to-night:&#xD;
rou have won from me more than two-huidred dollars, and I have'nt&#xD;
ime to stop, and recover my losses. - Another time however-"&#xD;
"It is not late.", Politely interrupted Livingston.&#xD;
"Not late,J know, but you must excuse me for to-iight," began'&#xD;
Juan, but arinmur of dissatisfaction among the speqtators checked&#xD;
him, and heeast' a meaning glance at Sinclair Duval.- Sinclair&#xD;
understood hini, and quietlyslippedabankbillintohis hands unobserved&#xD;
by the spebtators. Juan glanced at it hastily and a strange smile&#xD;
layed about his lips, he saw it was more than equal in value to all&#xD;
he hadlost  "If thenJ am to be revenged on you to-niht, Lawrence&#xD;
Livingston," said he gaily "I must  it at one stroke, there's any&#xD;
stake."&#xD;
"Good!"- exclaimed Livingston, and the cards were again&#xD;
arranged. The game was short, but played with the greatest cool-&#xD;
ness ahd attention.&#xD;
"You have lost" observed Juan carelessly, " are you satisfied&#xD;
now-&#xD;
"Ha, 'ha, you are very 'kind," returned Livingston, " but surely -&#xD;
you will not leave me so--'?'&#xD;
"Still at your service." Said Juan shuffling the cards.&#xD;
"9The stake,," suggested Livingston.&#xD;
"That same bill seems lucky one," the other observed with a&#xD;
anile, "if you have no objections."-&#xD;
&#xD;

Not the least."  Once more they played, and once more Juan&#xD;
&#xD;
von..&#xD;
"Confound it, had I not played a diamond when it should have&#xD;
been a trump-but never mind, we'll try the game once more.'&#xD;
S -"Livigston n.w studied the game.until t egpiratior p out&#xD;
upon his brow; played with the utmost caution; watched every&#xD;
move of his adversary as. the tiger watches hia prey; but 41l vain.&#xD;
A third time Juan wasinlucl l  ymivingstoasild noi a word,. but&#xD;
wiping the sweat from;his fteheAd, pro4edad to shpi$l the Car.&#xD;
- "The same stake again 1", asked Juan.,&#xD;
Livingston made no reply save a slight gesture of affirmation, and&#xD;
again the play went on.,&#xD;
aga"The devil is in your fingers to-night,' muttered Livingston&#xD;
forcing a smile as.still another gm0 wet over to Juan's favqr.&#xD;
"Only a momentary change ol fortune, you will-recover in a shoqt&#xD;
time."&#xD;
Again they played, and agai  Livingston lost. Ie. became&#xD;
agitated at last, and played like an iIane  an; clutching th'cars&#xD;
with desperate energy, and keepinghis blood-sot.eyes flidupon&#xD;
the game. Juan on theotherha; was ic     nd self-poesedhe&#xD;
appeared to regard his astonishing success with utmost indiffierene.&#xD;
A group of admiring spectatorssoQn gathered around them, greatly&#xD;
interested in the progress of the play.&#xD;
"My dear Sir," said Juan at length becoxhng unea syat the des-&#xD;
perate manner in which his 4versary played. "M ear Sir, is it&#xD;
not time to finish for to-night?  noAtheretime-"&#xD;
"Play on, play on!" interrupted Livintg#on in a h    ny voice.  d&#xD;
they did play on, an4 i.a half hour, a_ rsducedhis opponeoit to&#xD;
his last dollar. For a moment, as Livinton with his ashyh&#xD;
compressed, and his pale brow resting on', s hands, stared atte&#xD;
cards on the table, a death-like silence prevailed.&#xD;
"Let us away," Sinclair whispered, touching Juan unperceived&#xD;
upon , the shoulder.,.&#xD;
Juan glanced at his friend, then at Livingston and finally at' the&#xD;
pile of money he had'won.&#xD;
,Sinclair what shall I do I" he murmured, passing his hand&#xD;
across his brow." Here have I been playing for more than two hours,&#xD;
scarce knowing what I was about, I played for amusement, never&#xD;
once thinking that I have well nigh rueind this poor fellow, in fact&#xD;
when I look at the money here, it seems that I have been dreaming.&#xD;
Tell me have I won this fairly 1&#xD;
The latter sentence alone caught the ear of Livingston, who&#xD;
started up as if a sudden thought just flashed through his brain.&#xD;
"Fair play I" ho echoed with a ghastly smile, "I never lost like&#xD;
that with an honest player."&#xD;
"Sir !" cried Juan, as the hot'blood mounted his brow.&#xD;
Livingston was desperate. While all the spectators started back&#xD;
with a sort of savage delight, he sprang forward gazing fieteely at&#xD;
Juan, exclaimed-&#xD;

"Yes Sir," He said politely, but added with a sarcastic smile,&#xD;

"At any time, the sooner the better." Replied Livingston fiercely.&#xD;
"-Here is my address, I prefer taking difficulties coolly." Juan&#xD;
answered, extending' him hiscard. Then'-turning on his heel, he&#xD;
left the saloon in company with his friend, Sinclair Duval, who&#xD;
flueried.'&#xD;

"Why not ?"&#xD;
"Why not f" he is beside himself, desperate. Return the poor&#xD;

beside yourself, are you not? Consider 'he has insulted me, I cannot&#xD;
retreat' if I would, as it is,-I pity him, for I am confident he will&#xD;
lose not only his money, but probably his life also."&#xD;

CHAPTER III&#xD;
Tr MDUM&#xD;
On the day following, and occording to private appointment,&#xD;
Juan, and the exasperated and savage Livingston, with a seledti6n&#xD;
of some half dozen blacklegs, met in a reserved ro6n4 'donnebtd&#xD;
with the gambling hell, for the duel. Every avenue leading tohe&#xD;
appartment was tightly closed, windows shut, and'the do6rg'secutely&#xD;
locked. The gas was weakly turned on, giving a pale, sombre&#xD;
light to the murderous scene in the silent room.&#xD;
Sinclair Duval loved his frier d, and entered the place with a&#xD;
shudder. Even Juan betrayed less ardor 'for the strife than he 'exhib-&#xD;
ited on the evening previous. He seemed less excited, more cool.&#xD;
but firm. On the qther hand Livingston was even more passidiate&#xD;
and revengeful, than at the' first, and seemed anxious to commence&#xD;
the deadly conflict. In the course of twenty minutes the qi"et&#xD;
preliminaries being efected, at the given signal they stood in their&#xD;
places and crossed their swords, Juan more collected than his wine&#xD;
and anger-heated adversary, commencedon the defensive, as though&#xD;
merely going through the exercises w th a companion; while Liv-&#xD;
ingston crossed and thrust with an' angry. energy, contrasting&#xD;
strangely with the more careless action of his antagonist.&#xD;
For some time theirrglistening 'weapons wound about'leJ' other&#xD;
so to speak, with that grace and dexterity which bespeaks the-accom-&#xD;
plished s ordsman. iuan hardly pressed by his foe, handled his&#xD;
weapon ith greater rapidity and force, while his eye flashed with&#xD;
a strange and terrible meaning. The two blades clashed and grated&#xD;
against each other in and quick succession, when Livingston made a&#xD;
masterly thrust -and grazed his antagonist's side.&#xD;
" A hit," muttered the surrounding group.&#xD;
' A mere scratch," said Juan with a fiendish smile, "take him&#xD;
aWy, or there will be something worse ipa moment."&#xD;
lie now changed his mode'f defence into a furious 'and skilfi&#xD;
attack, thrustind' with s&#xD;
a     thrusting with such precision and'rapidity, that Livingston&#xD;
was obliged to fall back; Juan darted' forward,aid with a skilful&#xD;
,movement, wretched his antagonist's weapon from his grasp.&#xD;
sFinish mue at once," Livingston groaied.&#xD;
Resume your sword," Returned Juan with a triumphant smile.&#xD;
Liyingston did so. Again the two were opposed 'to each other&#xD;
a deadly strife. Twice the cold steel grazed' uan's breast. Liv-&#xD;
Lngstor was b'xCding at half a doeen winds.. Feeling histrength&#xD;
failing fast, he thrust fiercely at Juan, regardless of the wounds hi'&#xD;
himself received, and at last succeeded in wanting hisweapon direct.y&#xD;
beneath his ribs on the left side. No sooner did Juanfeel'the pang&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb  n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7595-00000007"/>&#xD;
Shoot through him, than summoning all his remaining strength, he&#xD;
plunged his sword into the bosom of his antagonist and fell with him&#xD;
to the floor. Duval sprang forward to assist his friend. 'He had&#xD;
already fainted, and the blood was gushing from his wound. -Two&#xD;
sur eons were at hand, one of them hastened tc, Juan's- side, and.&#xD;
while the other was occupied with Livingston, proceeded to examine&#xD;
the cut in his side. The blood was soon staunched and Juan was&#xD;
hssty~thughquietly conveoyed to a coich.&#xD;
"hate wound?"h qWispeid Sinor in an agony of doubt.&#xD;
"loangeinus, if not mortal." Replied the surgeon.&#xD;
Juanin a few moments more recoveredhis consciousness sufficently&#xD;
to articulate,&#xD;
SLivingston-bave I killed him ?"&#xD;
"Juan," exclaimed Duval, "do not speal."&#xD;
"But tell rpe is he dead ?"-&#xD;
"I do not'know, you must be quiet."&#xD;
-"Quiet,imPossibl6, until 'I know that he still lives."&#xD;
" He does."&#xD;
" Thank Heaven for that; 0, if he should die, I am a murderer,&#xD;
I am to. blame."&#xD;
l Hush Juan" Duval whispered, "remember it was in a duel-"&#xD;
A duel-yes; but how unpleasant to think of leaving the world&#xD;
responsible for the death of a fellow-beiig, even though he caused&#xD;
your own."&#xD;
"Juan what do you meann"&#xD;
*' That I feel what the surgeon would conceal from me, that my&#xD;
wound is rmortal and-"&#xD;
"No, No, it is not," Interrupted Sinclair inbroken accents, "it&#xD;
is pnly a slight hurt."&#xD;
",Sinclair do not attempt to deceive me, foi I feel that I am'going&#xD;
fast--"&#xD;
"Nai, do not think so Juan.'&#xD;
"Aid Sinclair-"&#xD;
His voice failed. His friend trembled with solicitation, drew nearer&#xD;
and applying his. ear to hi lips, whispered:&#xD;
"Juan speak on, what would you1"&#xD;
" My dear friend, I have bot two requests to make, which if you&#xD;
love ne, on will grant-&#xD;
"Speakthein-"     i     eat&#xD;
In the first place, ifyuv  mt     man, or the resemVace&#xD;
or a inan, nrnmed Pierre. Verree, a man of about fifty 'years, ask&#xD;
him if he remembers the slave 'Virginia,' and if he betrays the&#xD;
least emotion, it is he."&#xD;
'o  hoI"&#xD;
The man whom 1 have sought since I have been capable of&#xD;
upsheathing swordshe man I have worn by all that is sat red tt&#xD;

But Juan-&#xD;

JUA o0,4&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
-Do" not question me, but swear to -fulfil my request."&#xD;
"I swear." Said Duval firmly.&#xD;
"It is well," murmured the dying Juan. And now Sinclair,I have&#xD;
a secret for your heart alone. Take the locket you will find on my&#xD;
heart, and I need say no more, you will understand."&#xD;
Sinclair took the locket, opened it, and beheld her whom he had&#xD;
wecretely loved, Beatrite Capello.&#xD;
"You love her." He mu~nured.&#xD;
"Love h    er"'Juan sighed.  Ah! Sinclair, better than life." .&#xD;
~And she loves you I'&#xD;
"I scarce can tell that she even knows of the passion that has&#xD;
consumed me, and consumes me still-This portrait you will keep."&#xD;
Duval boWed and grasped the hand of -his friend tightly in token&#xD;
of his consent to all he spoke.&#xD;
- Keep it," Juan continued faintly, "as the choicest jewel youi&#xD;
friend ever possessed; whenever you look at' it, you wil'remember&#xD;
me, and for my sake, you will regard Beatrice as 'a sister, I cansay&#xD;
more, do not Sinclair, forget Verree-nor Beatrice.-M  y&#xD;

YALOUSY.    *&#xD;
CONTRARY to the expectations of.all, Juan survives his wonds,&#xD;
For several days, he lay, so to speak, on the brink of the grave; but&#xD;
thanks to.the surgeon's. skill, youth, and a naturally strong constitu-&#xD;
tion , he slowly reeovered.&#xD;
Beatrice sat aloe in her luxuriantly furnished boudoir, she had&#xD;
for some time, indulged in deep reflection upon a subject near her&#xD;
heart. Thinking half aloud,.she murtngred to herself&#xD;
"'Tis evidentCecelia ismore to him than a mere acting companion&#xD;
H loves her,.-! have it. She shall ,be my rival no longer; alre Iy&#xD;
have we recognized each other in the protnenado. I will despatch-&#xD;
her an invitation to join nie in a little private, banquet. Another to&#xD;
Livingston willbe sufficient to secure his proper attendance. Thanks&#xD;
to the physician, he has at last recovered from his late severe illness,&#xD;
'tis strange that Lawrence should be taken to his couch, so suddenlv.,-&#xD;
due though I presume, to an excess of indulgence-but to my plot,&#xD;
these two little mehengers will bring it to a favorable consumation,&#xD;
or I am little skilled.&#xD;
Thus saying, slie hastly despatchedd her invitations, the one to&#xD;
Cecelia, and the other to Lawrence Livingston; who, as has been&#xD;
intimated, recovered from his dangerous wounds received in the&#xD;
conflict with Juan. AaCordingly,-on the afternoon or rather evening&#xD;
appointed9 the amiable Cecelia joined the proud Beatrice inthe.hl&#xD;
of her father's stately mansion. Cecelia was greeted with smiles and&#xD;
a kiss, and cordidliy conducted to the sumptuous reception. Half an&#xD;
hour after, LawreiivLivingstoi attiied ala mode was admitted by&#xD;
the serva-nt,.and xushnere4into tie vpreseboe of the ladies. He was&#xD;
introduced to Cecelia, t9 whom he accorded all thesmost winsome&#xD;
and graceful courtisies of a finished&amp;amp; Chesterfield.&#xD;
He was indeed splendidly attired, and dIslayed a succession o&#xD;
the .most charming smiles, and sallies of humor and twit, he seemed&#xD;
.    destined to, make an impression upon the too succeptible heart of&#xD;
Cecelia - Conversation grew lively, and bon mots gay. The banquet&#xD;
was arranged the exhilirating wine soon flashed fromipto lip, and&#xD;
added s strange enchantment to the familiar repast. Beatrice grew&#xD;
elated. and Cecelig languid, the wine was doing its work, wated&#xD;
by the' accomplished,-and lofty Beatrice. She saW her moment had&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
&#xD;
WLa&#xD;
Several weeks after-the events related in our last chapter, Sinclair&#xD;
Duval was one day seated alone with Beatrice C apefo. She had&#xD;
- just been reading a novel of- sente agral, and the  ep, passionate&#xD;
breathing of some portions of the'work, seemed: to sink with effect&#xD;
upon her heart.. Her better nature prevailed, and tears of sympathy&#xD;
moistened her eyes,'like listening pearls.&#xD;
" Ah, friend Duval" she said ashe entered her presence. "I am&#xD;
glad-to see lyou,I have just: been reading,; and strong mst be the&#xD;
passion which is triumphant even in death andwich can inspire&#xD;
the heart to 'struggle against dissolution, and feel itself immortal by&#xD;
the strength of love alone, but then Lean scarce beleive in thieexistance&#xD;
of iucrlove--"&#xD;
'This is a rare book no doubt, for' it seems indeed to have affected&#xD;
you: much."&#xD;
" It is an excellent work,-.-"    .'&#xD;
But Miss Capello does not believe in such love 1"&#xD;

"Indeed 1"&#xD;
"Ii is so heavenly.&#xD;
'Yet .1 have witnessed it in a degree."&#xD;
Nowdu are'i-e  wiig serious-.but proceed to tell us, where,&#xD;
"hen; ar id n whotf, you'Witnessed iti ha, ha, ha."&#xD;
' In 'a frieid, " rnd 'bnt  short' time since.- I was by his side, a&#xD;
he lay upon his-couchAick nigh unto death, and his last thought&#xD;
were of one whom he laved deeply, perhaps hepelebsly."&#xD;
A friend did' you say 1" Asked the proud Beatrice interestedly.'&#xD;
"Yes,' adit is a friend of mne, too,,whom he4oved."&#xD;
"And ,he4 nVei knew hisentiaieits towards her 1"&#xD;
"He was not confident, forhe feared she might despise the ofbring&#xD;

So saying, he drew on his fitiesL:coat, carefbllyplaced his hat on&#xD;
his head, drew on his -lilac kids, put on his gold spectacles, took'&#xD;
down his cane, and stood before the glass a.feWrminutes to arrange&#xD;
two or three disordered hais, and announced. himself ready to&#xD;
decend. They stepped' into the corridor or hall, but ere he closed&#xD;
the door, Pillington instinctively returned to the reflector of beauty,&#xD;
the glass. Replaced his hat,' arranged his spectacles, properly -ove&#xD;
his eyes, brushed 'up-his hair again, and rejoined his companions on&#xD;
the; verandah ner 'the street, .They were soonmingled with the&#xD;
crowd of gay- pleasure-seekers of Walnut and Chestnut' streets&#xD;
Passing down Walnut street, they saw Adelia and Louda Duval, just&#xD;
comingout, they bowed " weetly," as Timothy afterwards'remarked&#xD;
and Livingston and Mortimore' joined them, while Timothy himself,&#xD;
passed on, and' soon enjoyed theninexpressible pleasure of joining&#xD;
Araminta. How his heart palpitated, he colored and looked Inter.&#xD;
esting. They walked together most lovingly, the " observed' of all&#xD;
observers"  Ai-aniinta was one of those amiable and accomplished&#xD;
creatures, whose beauty'consists of',il the 'varied-accomplishmentse&#xD;

During Timothy's affected recital of his mishap, brought on by&#xD;
old Soloman Winkle's ancient sign, Livingston and Mortimore&#xD;
roared with laughter.&#xD;
"Ha, ha, ha," laughed Mortimore, " I witnessed similar scenes&#xD;
there, in front of old Winkle's, the optician's door, on several occa-&#xD;
sions, that sign of the 'Eye,' and 'See the other side,' has proved&#xD;
the means of bringing many a well enough disposed ,person in&#xD;
heavy contract with the pavement in slippery weather. And do&#xD;
you know' Pillington, it was that very sign, that partially suggested&#xD;
to me the title of my paper ?"&#xD;
" Two copies of which I had in my pocket when 1 fell,and which.&#xD;
I have lost, as well as cracked my glasses."&#xD;
" Ha, ha, better for the business of old Winkle ; Now you must&#xD;
take them, and have him repair or exchange them for you."&#xD;
"Aw, I would do so, but I would not meet the gaze and encounter&#xD;
the merriment of those vixen girlsagain for a new pair of, glasses;&#xD;
I would not 'pon my soul."&#xD;
" But Tim," spoke Livingston, "you haven'ttold us yet altogether&#xD;
how your fall ended ; How did you regain terra firma ?"&#xD;
" Well, that I can tell, precisely. I was assisted by some&#xD;
one, I know not who, but finally we all stood upright once more,&#xD;
and after a great deal of bowing, courtesing and scraping, the ladies&#xD;
hastened into the store, the old gentleman and boy followed slowly&#xD;
and I-left. I believe none of us were very"'seriously hurt, only I&#xD;
was awfull= nlbrtified. extremely mortified. 1 was indeed."&#xD;

Muzzy.&#xD;
"Yes, and as is always my fate, I burst my panteloons in both&#xD;

Bythe .way, Tim, you go to the Opera to-morrow night?"&#xD;

"And Poodle," laughed Muzzy.&#xD;
"No, Mortimore, aw, you mistake, she does call me her ' pet,' and&#xD;

He went to the Opera, and had a delightful talk with Araminta.&#xD;
who whispered from behind her fan and said, "it is very warm."&#xD;

he had heen guilty of nearly, or quite all :of thediolissywhich&#xD;
have been so frequently encountered in tho; wealthy, biat unprin-&#xD;
cipled and licentious. He marriedhappily, but hi domestic happiess&#xD;
was ng4.destined to flowof without interruption, for scarcely hadihe&#xD;
tasted of its delights, when the partner of his bosom died, leading&#xD;
him as, a pledge of departed affectiQn; Beatrice an only child. He&#xD;
did not marry again, but the remainder of his life seemed devoted&#xD;
-to the happiness and improvement of Beatrice to this:he eolecrated&#xD;
his leasure and his fortune. It;seemedhischief delight to see hergrow&#xD;
up under his personal, cars, to watch thetdevplopment of her mental&#xD;
and physical powers; and now that ahe had become a woman, ab&#xD;
his happiness seemed centered iii her, as before ithad been centered&#xD;

epiode only, it proved the absorption of=his entire better ,nature.&#xD;

Capello, was absorbed in revolving through his mind,the ,ncoequer&#xD;
result, and real propriety of Juan and his daughter's frqi ent inter&#xD;
views. He had but of late, noted the deep attaghmezgfwhich they&#xD;
seemed to possess for each other ; and began to reflect upon the&#xD;
propriety of giving his, only daughter to one, who in fact, ss yet&#xD;
seemed to him, but little more than a stranger. To his dislike of&#xD;

Such Signor Capello is, my short but humiliating history."&#xD;
Juan walking to and fro, excited by the'consciousness of his own&#xD;
degradation, paused, and concluded-'-&#xD;
" And now I ask you, Signor:Capello, frankly, can you grant me&#xD;
your daughter's hand in marriage 1"&#xD;
Antonio Capellostupitied with horror, made no reply; but remained&#xD;
gazing on the agitated Juan in silence.&#xD;
" Speak !" cried Juan earnestly, " can she be mine?"&#xD;
CapCllo pressed his trembling hands over his brow, and in a husky&#xD;
voice answered:&#xD;
" Oh, impossible !&#xD;
Juan no longer hoped; yet the painful, interest that Capello had&#xD;
taken'in him, appeared to allow him room to question further, and he&#xD;
inquired:&#xD;
" Why.impossible&#xD;
u*She is-oh Heavens, yes, yes I will confess it-"&#xD;
" Thdn speak ; she is-"&#xD;
"Your sister."&#xD;
" Mly sister !"&#xD;
-- Yes- am'Verree, your father."&#xD;
Juan for a moment, in turn, was stupified and speechless;' while&#xD;
his glaring eyes, fixed on the speaker, seemed in their intensity of&#xD;
gaze, to be starting from hid head. He was startled as if just&#xD;
awakening from the embrace of a viper. At length. the spell was&#xD;
broken, and stepping abruptly before the Signor, he ejaculated:&#xD;
" Did I hear correctly, Signor Antonia Capello ? Did you say you&#xD;
are my father ?"&#xD;
"1 i." Said Capello calmly.&#xD;
" Then hear me," said Juan in a changed and passionate voice.&#xD;
-- I have said. I would punish the oppressor of my mother;for he&#xD;
acted basely, inhumanly, and Signor if you are he, I insult and defy&#xD;
you on the spot, I hesitate not.to call you murderer."&#xD;
" How !" .eried Capello starting to hig'feet, and im-  eptibly&#xD;
-drawing a knife from his inside pocket, and secreting  'and&#xD;
"You are a cowardly'villian I!" Eelaimed Juan fiercely.&#xD;
The quick,firery bloolofrage, mounted toCapllo's broW, and trem-&#xD;
bling in every muscle with passion; he  strode furiously towards Juan&#xD;
raised his hand, but ere his heavy blow descended upon his son, lhe&#xD;
strangely restrained himself, white with rage,'and quivering in every&#xD;
fibre of his body, he hissed:&#xD;
"Young Man, I see you would'seek a qutirel with nie but insult&#xD;

my mother was groaning in the agonies of death, beneath the bloody&#xD;
lash, and when your son, as you now call me, toiled and wept be-&#xD;
neath the gallingoppression of slavery.?&#xD;
"Your son!!" continued Juan, striking the table fiercely, "and&#xD;
for that very reason your mortal enemy. And now that I .have&#xD;
found you, my-own and ,my mother's wrongs shall not go un-&#xD;
avenged."&#xD;
"Juan, calm yourself;" said Capello, quite recovering his self-&#xD;
possession. " This is a subject that shouldn't be handled rashly.&#xD;
In thefirst place;consider that in spite of all your taunts andin-&#xD;
suits, I will never raise my hand against youl"&#xD;
" Because I an your son,) and becnase you regard me with pater-&#xD;
nal tendernes" said Juan, with a most withering sneer.&#xD;
" I repeat it, I will never fight with you; I will never take your&#xD;
life-murderer though you call me, neither shall you take mine,&#xD;
nay do not start, but ,hear me; I acknowledge that I have done&#xD;
wrong, and that you have a perfect right to hate-to punish me ;&#xD;
if Heaven wills, I will die, but not by the hand of a son."&#xD;
"If Heaven wills it--"&#xD;
" Yes, if Heaven wills it, I will terminate 'my own existende---&#xD;
punish myself."&#xD;
Hesitating a moment, Juan gazed intently into the calm, plot-&#xD;
ting face of his father. His eye caught their figures reflected&#xD;
in full length and' outline, in 'a massive, Spanish mirror, which&#xD;
extended nearly the entire length -of the room, immediately before&#xD;
thom Juan advancing to the old gentleman's side, said:-&#xD;
"Signor Capello; deign to cast a glance in that splendid reflec-&#xD;
tor there ?"&#xD;
Instinctively, as it were, Capello's eyes sought the glass. He&#xD;
looked, and saw his own, and his' son's countenances and forms&#xD;
reflected side by side; in every lineament, and in every feature,&#xD;
how. like each other?  Both beheld a remarkable resemblance.&#xD;
To the parent it seemed an unpleasant "reflection," and his brow&#xD;
lowered as Juan continued:-&#xD;
" see,,old dotard, how like each other our faces are? in truth,&#xD;
though born a slave, my skin is as fair, as white as -thine. So&#xD;
you 're my father, the author of my degradation and slavery, the&#xD;
oppressor and murderer of .my mother ?"&#xD;
He grasped the old man by the hand. Capello writhed, and&#xD;
twisted and'struggled to unloose the death-like hold of his aveng-&#xD;
ing song--his hand was on his thoat.&#xD;
"Yillain1" cried Juan, in revenge, "your game. is played."&#xD;
Capello grasped for his knife. "You destroyed the mother, and&#xD;
now by treacherous;plotting would kill;the son, but amid the ex-&#xD;
posed fragments of your hellish scheme, broken into as many atoms&#xD;
as your vast refleetor. Die'! no longer call me son."&#xD;
Saying whieh, he with the redoubled strength of despair and&#xD;
revenge, hurled him into the centre of his massive looking-glass,&#xD;

aiming at excellence in the tragic art she found her way to&#xD;
Philadelphia.&#xD;
She had scarcely concluded, when they were both startled by 'a&#xD;
rap at the door. Cecelia knew thp sound, and trembling with ear&#xD;
was silent. Withoutrmuch delay, however, and without awaiting&#xD;
the invitation, the affable butvillainous  Livingston, bowed himself&#xD;
into the room. He was disconcerted not a little, on recognizing by&#xD;
the side of the fair Cecelia, his late antagonist in the duel. Juan sprang.&#xD;
towards him, and closed the door. Livingston ran his hand almost&#xD;
imperceptibly over his person, as if in search of some weapon of&#xD;
defence, but disappointed at finding he was unarmed, he muttered a&#xD;
hasty and forced apology, and desired the privilege of leaving the&#xD;
room peacably, as he came.&#xD;
"Villian, do we meet again?"' Gritted Juan, as he turned and&#xD;
confronted him. "What do you here ?"&#xD;
"Tush, what'-is that to you? 'twere better for the present, that you&#xD;
allow me to depart." Livingston replied with sore degree of aumed&#xD;
dignity,&#xD;
"Not until. you account to me, for this abrupt intrusion into this&#xD;
apartment." Juan hissed.pnro                        tt&#xD;
"HaJ by what authority do you make such a demand 1"&#xD;
" Upon the. authority of a brother; prepared to shield a sister's&#xD;
honor, and fully able to.avenge her wrongs." Juan replied sternly.&#xD;
" A  brother," Livingston sneered. "Cecelia the sister  f a'&#xD;
fugitive ?"&#xD;
"Stay, I'll none of this. She is my sister," hissed Juan, advancing&#xD;
to the mantle-piece, and laying his hand on a pistol,. he continued.&#xD;
"'Tis time to close thisparley,.here are pistols, take 'one and defend&#xD;
your miserable life'&#xD;
" But that would be unequal, I would not risk my life with a&#xD;
slave."&#xD;
"Cowardly insulter, say that again, and you die on the spot.&#xD;
Here, villian, must I force you tQ defend yourself, take this, and let&#xD;
us not meet again."- Said Juan extending him'ope of the pistols.&#xD;
He seized it with an eager grasp and as Juan turned to walk to&#xD;
the middle of the room, hastily fired, but Juan, unharmed, turned&#xD;
quickly, and seizing him by the throat would, without discharging&#xD;
his pistol, have strangled him to death, but Cecelia having recovered&#xD;

not," saved ,him. Her impulsive sympathy prevailed, and Juan&#xD;
exacting a promise of honor on her behalf, permitted Livingston to&#xD;
leave which he did with secret vengeance burning in his heart.&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
van Lovan.&#xD;
Leaving Cecelia in the care of her brother, we will now transport&#xD;
the reader to that beautiful place of fashionable resort. during the&#xD;
summer season, Cape May.&#xD;
'Tis a moon-light eve ; and over the snow white sand and peb.&#xD;
blues of the shore, sparkle in the bright light, the vast resplendant&#xD;
beach glittering as the jewelled band of ocean; over which the same&#xD;
silvery light continues as if bathing in the reflection of a spacious&#xD;
mirror. The sea itself, calm and unruffled,' reposed, as if lulled&#xD;
et last, by h4 own constant rocking into quiet sleep. Along the&#xD;
shore are scattered groups of visitors of nearly every age, of both&#xD;
sexes, and from all parts of the union. And "Ah," shall we sigh,&#xD;
the heart- of many a young girl, beats quick and high, as, leaning&#xD;
confidently on the arm of her lover, she listens to his soft empassioned&#xD;
vows of constancy and still increasing love. Among the happy&#xD;
throng along the romantic beach. we encounter the Duvals, Sinclair,&#xD;
and is two sisters, Adella and Lousia.&#xD;
The sea seemed glassy in silence, and the gay, merry laugh from&#xD;
many a full, free heart bounded out from the shore, upon his calm,&#xD;
silvery surface, and danced away into distant echo.&#xD;
Leaving Sinclair in company with a Miss Lindsay of the city,&#xD;
and the two sisters having take their leave of their gay gallatts,&#xD;
we will follow them to the quiet reception at the Hotel, where the&#xD;
following insubstance passed between Louisa and Adelia:&#xD;
" O, Louisa, what a delightful place this Cape May is, to be sure ;&#xD;
So romantic,.and yet so gay. Such a splendid beach,. and such&#xD;
pleasant zephyrs from thesea, and then such com pany ; 0,I declare,&#xD;
am quite sorry our stay here is to be so short."&#xD;
"And so am I, for it seems to me Adelia, that I could be happy&#xD;
here forever, particularly for such pleasant excursions over the&#xD;
beach, among the diamonds andshells, as we have had this evening,&#xD;
-but soft, did you mark Marston ; 0 was.he not delightful and gay?&#xD;
"And Lemuel was nearly bewitching, and with his happy com-&#xD;
pan    appeared enchanted, well, I think I shall yet like him as a&#xD;
brother.&#xD;
Adelia colored, at the sudden allusion to her evening gallant.&#xD;
But the gay, laughing Louisa prattled away at a hi.morops rate,.&#xD;
until the apartnnt rang again with her merry' laugh ; She was the&#xD;
youngest of the two sisters, and- differed with Adelia both in dis o&#xD;
sition and person. She was not quite so tall--with less dignity ut&#xD;
her vivacious and happy wit, appeares as harmless as it ever was,&#xD;
entertaining. Though born at the sunny South, they were liberally&#xD;
educated at the North. Their father, Elmer tDuval df French&#xD;
&#xD;
48&#xD;
&#xD;
asas es,&#xD;
&#xD;
-educated at the North. Their father, Elmer Duval of French&#xD;
,extraction, and late of South Carolina was possessed of 'considerable&#xD;
wealth.&#xD;
Adelia feigned a participation in her sister's mirth  and to divert&#xD;
attention from herself, spoke of her pleasure at sing their brother&#xD;
Sinclair so happy in the"company of Miss.Lindsay.&#xD;
" O, yes," laughed Louisa; " I ws delighted to see. them-enjoy&#xD;
themselves so much, but I thought Iwould have died with delight, at&#xD;
observing the sentiment and grace of Timothy ; O, did you ever in&#xD;
your life, meet with such a fine, delicate, and fastidious little fellow.&#xD;
With what poetry, and exquisite nicety he ' aw,' describes the ' aw,'&#xD;
beautiful, 'aw,' moonlight scene, 'aw,' ha, ha."&#xD;
- "Pshaw, Louisa, how can you speak so, of such a soulless senti-&#xD;
mental, rainless fop."&#xD;
. "You do not fancy him Adelia, but to-night I am, pleased with&#xD;
all1'&#xD;
"Particularly with Mr. Marton."  Said Adelia.&#xD;
The sprightly Louisa, was of a rosy hue naturally; but the name&#xD;
just syllabled in her ear, visibly deepened her healthful color._. For&#xD;
a second her countenance fell, and she appeared more beautiful than&#xD;
ever. She raised her eves languidly, and casting her arms about&#xD;
her sister's neck, kissed her, and whispered:-&#xD;
" Yes-but is not my sister happy in my choice ?&#xD;
"Dear Louisa, I am."  She returned affectionately.&#xD;
The season of pleasure at the Capes, closed. And the latter&#xD;
portion of the months of September and October, were passed by&#xD;
them in Pjiladelphia, where the Theatre, Opera and other places of&#xD;
amusement came in for a goodly share of their.attention.&#xD;
On arriving in the city, Sinclair again sought out his friend, Juan ;&#xD;
who informed him of his dicovery that Ceceliathe Actress, was&#xD;
his long unknown sister.&#xD;
"But," he added. "Capello~ has removed, whither, none can&#xD;
definitely tell, but I have very strong reasons for beleiving he has&#xD;
gone South; I must follow him, l'or be revenged I will, if I have to&#xD;
seek him in the midst of my enemies."&#xD;
"Juan, reflect; go among your enemies you most assubedly will&#xD;
if you retrace your steps South. Give over this mad pursuit of&#xD;
revenge; and let Providence deal with him; remembering, ' Ven.&#xD;
geance is' mine, -saith the Lord, and I will repay."'&#xD;
" Sinclair are you indeed serious, have you, so soon forgotten&#xD;
your late promise ? vengeance belongeth to the Lord, I allow, but&#xD;
does he operate without the instrument or means, does he not often&#xD;
punisht men and nations, for their crimes by their fellow men ? but&#xD;
Sinclair, I cannot argue the subject; if, you  tanot consent to&#xD;
accompany me, I shall love, you none the less,'but must go alone.&#xD;
But enough of this for "the present, 'tis a gloomy subject at best, let&#xD;
us speak of something else ;-how have you enjoyed yourself since&#xD;
T saw you ?"&#xD;

"Thanks; I shall visit them. "How is Mr. Duval and lady?"&#xD;
"Quite well, in a few days they leave for home."&#xD;

" We can; but Juan, I fear for you,"&#xD;

No, but for. the disagreeable consequences of your hot pursuit&#xD;
of vengeance.'&#xD;
Leave that to me; there is less certainty of detection at the&#xD;
South than here."&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
&#xD;
TanDIts1xIO c0NSPIRTORS.&#xD;
In the city of Charleston, and at the still hour of midnight., in 'the&#xD;
month of Decerniber, and from the beautiful pleasure ground-the&#xD;
Battery," a solitary boat pushed out from the shore; quiet anad&#xD;
quick it glides out towards the rriddle of the bay. A dense, dark&#xD;
cloud just leaving the moon unobscured, we are enabled by her&#xD;
welcome light to see' the boat some four hundred yards from us,&#xD;
and moving directly for an inverted bendof the thick foliaged wild-&#xD;
wood skirting the opposite shore. -On, on in silence, it glides;over&#xD;
the dark waters, like a- self-moving' thing of life.- . It :strikes the&#xD;
shore, two- men leap out, and making the boat fast beneath a clump&#xD;
of 'bushes, that hang over and dip the water; in five, minutes, they&#xD;
approach a large, old manor-house, closed -tightly from basement to&#xD;
top, and situated in the midst of a most beautiful inclosure of flowers&#xD;
and forest trees, in which universal'solitude, seems-"to be the&#xD;
reigning monarch. But the two men approach the main entrance of&#xD;
the mansion, and giving the 'secret signal, they are immediately&#xD;
admitted, and completed a group of some twelve or thirteen dark&#xD;
clad men of diversified temperaments and mental-endowments. But&#xD;
without entering into a description of them separately we will give&#xD;
a single glance round the-room. It is a spacious apartment, the&#xD;
largest in the house. A single lamp is 'the only. vessel of light 'in&#xD;
the room, and which stands on a long, plain:table, :upon which lay&#xD;
scattered a number of half written nmanusbripts, sundry papers,&#xD;
notes, etc., imparting to the deserted old hall, a faint air of business.&#xD;
Around the table are arranged perhaps a dozen or more fold&#xD;
fashioned, high back mahogany chairs, in them are seated our new&#xD;
company of men, all more or less absorbed in the examination'of&#xD;
the portentious papers before them. At the far end;of the.table and&#xD;
next to' 'the lamp, sits a personage possessed of strangely striking&#xD;
features; and movements; he ras already been introduced to the&#xD;
reader, as Signor Antonio Capello. The rapid, penetrating glances&#xD;
of his large black eyes, as he interestedly scans the numerous writings,&#xD;
give proof'of the restless spirit within. 'Lifting his, eyes fron the&#xD;
papers fora moment andglancing hastily round the tableiheremarked&#xD;
to his companions t-&#xD;
" Well gentleme , friends, we have had an excellent time of it,&#xD;
to-day, at least."ti,'/4&#xD;
Excellent indeed." Dropped in congratulation frombseveral of&#xD;
the company.&#xD;
Withbrave Richard we can say:truly 'the.workgoes bravely on&#xD;
The convention to-day, besides evincing their determined spirit in&#xD;
various well-drunk toasts, have published a number of gratifying&#xD;

speeches, and passed resolutions, breathing in every line, an unswerv-&#xD;
ing determination of severing at the cannon's mouth, and with the&#xD;
sword, the American Union."&#xD;
A slight degree of favorable;agitation, was quite susceptible round&#xD;
the board in th hurried glances of approval, from one to the other&#xD;
but in a moment, all eyes rested on the speaker, who continued:-&#xD;
"Already we have the state legislature with us, her written&#xD;
pledges in    and white. They are about to meet in convention,&#xD;
when by one bold, undivided. act of secession, they will declare and&#xD;
publish to the world, that South Carolina, is free from the yoke of.&#xD;
Northern aggression and tyranny forever." .&#xD;
" Ha Iha l truly encouraging,".laugh the listening group&#xD;
At this free out spoken approval, Capello grew  animated and&#xD;
flushed, with a feeling of triumph he arose to his feet, and in strains&#xD;
warm and vehement, continued:-&#xD;
" Aye, gentleman, my word and fortune for the truth of the&#xD;
declaration ; South Carolina,.the glorious old' palmetto state,.shall&#xD;
yet stand the bright centre ,of the entire South, refulgent and free;&#xD;
all are watching our movement -in the present crisis, to follow us in&#xD;
a solid Phalanx against the North; and then holy brothers, the Order&#xD;
of ' Jeshurun,' assisted by'the warm blooded sons of the South,&#xD;
shall strike deep their governing principles, and make South Carolina&#xD;
their secure seat of power. If they do'-not, then I wish to live no&#xD;
longer, so let Heaven blast me. 'But come, let us drink to our certain&#xD;
success, and thus while we devise to conquor, let our, motto be-&#xD;
'Extended rule.'"&#xD;
As they toss off the exciting champagne, we will say by the way,&#xD;
that seven of :these disunionists, are  secretely, active Jesuits,&#xD;
league together 'as the order of s"Jeshurun" for the purpose of&#xD;
subjugating the United States to their domination, by every subtle&#xD;
and crafty means which theirnatures and sworn cunning may suggest,&#xD;
their motto, as we have seen. it to be-" To devide is to conquer,"&#xD;
while the mystic signification, of their eclisiastic name is-Priest&#xD;
craft,Deception and War.&#xD;
The champagne had passed among them but once, when one of&#xD;
the company was called to 'the 'door,:by aoth'er signal from without.&#xD;
The"a pass,": was; demanded, ana "Secession," as promptly given,&#xD;
the.door opened, and 'the new comer entered in' the person of a&#xD;
youthful, though:dignified lookingman ;: hishair was bushy and full,.&#xD;
and a heavy moustache, covered his:upper lip; which, was it not for&#xD;
an almost perpetualsmile,and a benignant eye,would have imparted.&#xD;
a considerable degree of sternness of purpose,-and invincibility of,&#xD;
will te-his entire: face. Dt:hei advanced among the assembled&#xD;
secessionalists, wvith a graceful, easy air, at once modest and respect-&#xD;
ful. . At-an invitation to jointhem iM their sentiments of the evening,&#xD;
he pleasantly spoke as follows:&#xD;
" Gentlemen arid brother f:the same happy Order, allow me to&#xD;
give the 'coming ,crisis'-rnay :the bold sons of South Carolina in&#xD;
pleading her rights, goon conquering and to conquer. "&#xD;
&#xD;
. !&#xD;
&#xD;
55&#xD;
&#xD;
It was drunk off with a universal murmur of satisfaction.&#xD;
.Another;' Said the same person, " and then you allow ine to&#xD;
take a glance on, those documents I-see scattered over the board.&#xD;
it looks like business. Secession stock no doubt is on the advance,&#xD;
it must advance; but the toast. 'Our sister states of the South,&#xD;
identified with us in sentiment, feeling and interest will not, cannot&#xD;
be against us in the approaching contest of state sovereignty.'"&#xD;
They joined in -the sentiment with' boisterous glee, and having&#xD;
emptied his glass, the stranger, who, by the way, was one of the&#xD;
- Palmetto Cadets," turned to look over the manuscripts on the&#xD;
table, he 'glanced over 'the several .notes of allegiance, read them&#xD;
and smiled. Ten or fifteen minutes more, and they all drank, again&#xD;
to their future success. It was long past midnight, when in groups&#xD;
of three and four, they sauntered down towards their boats, which&#xD;
were drawn from their secret cove, and filled with the celerity of&#xD;
thought, all were pushing hurriedly from the shore, when they were&#xD;
startled by a gurgling shriek from the stranger. As they all turned&#xD;
towards him, they beheld him struggling wildly with the rising&#xD;
pillows, they hastened to the rescue, and succeeded in drawing him&#xD;
from the foaming and dashing surf, safely to land. As he arose to&#xD;
the surface of the water, the moon' shining down brightly'-upon him,&#xD;
revealed to their utter amazement, the long, flowing hair, and pallid&#xD;
countenance of a woman. The false moustache' 'had been 'washed&#xD;
away, and her sex was no longer concealed.&#xD;
" By my faith, a woman I" Exclaimed the wonder stricken&#xD;
-ecessionists, as they gathered around her.&#xD;
" 'Tis strange, what could have been her object? she still lives."&#xD;
" Curiosity is a plague to some. but to her we see it has well nigh&#xD;
proved death."&#xD;
" A woman, say you T   Capedo enquired coming up with the&#xD;
company assembled around the bewildered woman&#xD;
"Yes a woman."'-Duval laughed, " ha, ha, Capello we mxave the&#xD;
ladies with us."&#xD;
"There must be some secret, here; back' to the manor, 'and bear&#xD;
her with you, bak to the manor."  Capello commanded, rore than&#xD;
solicited.&#xD;
But ere they reached the mansion;sherevived,and fearfully shrieked:&#xD;
" Oh, father, father save me I"&#xD;
"Heavensj1 'tis Beatrice; my daughter low is this V" 'Exclaimed&#xD;
the afflicted Capello, smitten almost beyond endurance,&#xD;
He staggered, rather than ran to his beloved child,'and clasping&#xD;
her surf-dripping form in his arras, sobbed%~convulsively. They were&#xD;
borne into the spacious room from which,-but a few minutes before,&#xD;
they departed entire strangers. The light was procured, and then&#xD;
the secessionalists gazed for several minutes i wonder upon a scene&#xD;
that appeared to hold them all completely spell-bound.&#xD;
"Oh, my father, forgive me; oh father forgive=-" . She exclaimed&#xD;
in the deepest penitance.&#xD;
" Beatrice, my daughter, why have you acted thus with me ? 0&#xD;

what have I ever done Beatrice, to merit such deception; why have&#xD;

And as' though still to assure himself that 'he was not mistaken$in&#xD;
the person, and voice of his daughter, he tore the tightly buttoned&#xD;
coat and vest from her person, which disclosed her silken dress yet&#xD;
quite dry. Next the pants were removed, and she stood in their&#xD;
midst a lovely woman again, in her own attire. She thengave her&#xD;
cause for thus visiting them; being her love -of adventure. Full&#xD;
explanation being given, they all congratulated .her on her escape&#xD;
from drowning, and hinted that she must have drank too many toasts&#xD;
at the meeting; this she archly-denied, and soon they were on-their&#xD;
way home once mort, rejoicing.&#xD;

6 due couple of time the ease of Juan and Capello, came up for&#xD;
trial. Juan and his friend were punctual and prompt, in appearing&#xD;
at the bar'of justice, but Capello failing to appear against his son,&#xD;
Juan was acquitted. Shortly after, he left the city in company with&#xD;
Sinclair Duval.&#xD;
It was - on a beautiful afternoon in the month ofl'January, they&#xD;
were walking arm in arm along the most wealthy portion of King&#xD;
street, Charleston. Though in January, the sun shone down over&#xD;
the city-bright and warm. King street being their fashionable avenue&#xD;
of promenade, the beaux and bells were out in their gayest colors,&#xD;
and presented to the eye of the animated observer, a scene at once.&#xD;
picturesque and pleasing.&#xD;
Juan and Sinclair, were passing along gaily and enjoying the&#xD;
busy scene, with a zest ; when among others, a beautiful barouche,&#xD;
drawn by a couple of black horses, attracted their momentary&#xD;
attention.&#xD;
"That's a splendid establishment." Juan remarked to his friend.&#xD;
"It is, and I almost envy its owner "&#xD;
" Those blacks move beautifully ; so regularly and even, but see&#xD;
they have stopped at Clarksons let us hasten on and get a peep at&#xD;
-thosenside."&#xD;
They quickened their paces, and reached the store just as one-of&#xD;
the vassals opened the coach door, cast down the,:steps, and the&#xD;
young lady decended to the side walk.&#xD;
"AsI live;' it is 'Beatrice I" Ejaculated Duval to Juan, the-latter&#xD;
started with surprise. She looked up, and recognizing -inelair,&#xD;
smiled complacently, he raised his hat, and returned her easy bow.&#xD;
For 'a second her gaze sought Juan, she smiled, but it was cold and&#xD;
withering, and she hastened into the store.&#xD;
" Ahem, Sinclair, she does know us, I believe"&#xD;
" Without' doubt.; but she is the very ast person I expected to&#xD;
neet here so soon."n_&#xD;
"Her smile on you seemed bewitching; but on re it wap changed&#xD;
in a moment, to the most venomed sneer; her father surely; cannot&#xD;
have told her of our relationship?"&#xD;
"How could he have-done so, without exposing.himself?" Joined&#xD;
Duval.&#xD;
"He could ;rot. Then she must' have thought of our wrestling&#xD;
exercises in the parlor, in Philadelphia."&#xD;
"'Tis that, without doubt."&#xD;
Well that may wear off, at least I hope so, for I cannot fr get&#xD;
she is still my sister '&#xD;

words. " What evil'fate has sneit him here, so close upon-myrheels.&#xD;

thus so closely.: But leave me Beatrice, your company awaits(you&#xD;

"There, there, go my-daughter ; do not.question me, I' havenow&#xD;
several letters' of importance to reply to, and would be alone."&#xD;
The'affectionate Beatrice retired obediently. ,&#xD;
Well, well,'this is news indeed,". Capello muttered, approaching&#xD;
his desk.'°":Why'does that scoundrel haunt me thus? How foolish&#xD;
I've been, aftet all, in not having him secured in jail for life, why&#xD;

"Yea Sir Pafrone." '&#xD;
"Show him up."&#xD;

One week subsequent, as Juan unfolded the morning paper, that&#xD;
had just been brought into the room by the servant, his eye fell upon&#xD;
the alluring advertisement, which had appeared for several days.&#xD;
without attracting his hotice, and the projector of the scheme was&#xD;
about to abandon the design a ,a failure. Juan read it over at first&#xD;
with but little interest, but every additional reading seemed to clothe&#xD;
it with more of interest and reality. He folded the paper up, and'&#xD;
sought his friend, Sinclair, whom: finding in his study, saluted him&#xD;
with a pleasant good morning,.and placed the advertisement before=&#xD;
him, saying:&#xD;
" Read, and tell me what you thin of it.&#xD;

Hamlet, and Othello, *vil take the Spaniards by storm; and your&#xD;
Capello create a new era in the drama."&#xD;
Come, come, Sinclair, what do you mean ?"&#xD;
" Why the Looking-glass scene in Capello's parlor, at Philadelphia,&#xD;
ha ! ha!'&#xD;
"That was a crash, indeed, and no mistake."&#xD;
" A scene sufficiently thrilling to bring the house down with .cries&#xD;
The sentegice was broken off by a hearty laugh.from each of&#xD;
them, and they started in search of the office on Broad street; which&#xD;
after a few minutes walk they entered, and were greeted with the&#xD;
blandest smile of which Monsieur Dafrone was capable. He invited&#xD;
them into his private office, which was furnished in a splendid&#xD;
style, more indeed like a palace chamber than a placeof business;&#xD;
and which still confirmed Juan's good opinion of her Majesty's agent'&#xD;
After inquiring thename of his new applicant, the hearing of&#xD;
which gave him concealed gratification, he commenced out of ford,&#xD;
to question Juan in regard to his capabilities, of, which he received&#xD;
abundant and satisfactory testimonials ;:arid an engagement, at-ass&#xD;
extravagant salary, was immediately effected. They took' their ,&#xD;
leave ofIMonsieurDafrone,receiving withthankshis urgent solicitation&#xD;
of paying him another visit before the vessel sailed.&#xD;
In the meanwhile, Timothy Pillington, still revolves his delicately&#xD;
cologned existance round the Continental, Philadelphia. It was&#xD;
in the evening of .a "tedious, dismal day," which he had spent in&#xD;
"trying on," his new suit of black, that Mortimore and Livingston,&#xD;
were again' in his company.&#xD;
"tWell Tim, to be social, howhave you ' put in the day?'"&#xD;
"That's the question," laughed Mortimore.&#xD;
"Well, aw, have a segar, be comfortably seated, and I will tell&#xD;

good Havanas - " Aw, of the Ball last night, I suppose .1 need not&#xD;
speak, but that was a superb affair."&#xD;
"-I never saw Araminta appear so excessively charming, as she&#xD;
did in the dance last night." Put in Livingston.&#xD;
" She was exquisite, and complimented me highly upon my pro-&#xD;
ficiency in the Polka,the Redowa, the Schottislie and Mazourka; aw,&#xD;
in which I had the inexpressible pleasure of pressing her near my&#xD;
heart. For I find reports are true,. and that she will come into&#xD;
possession of her property on her next birth-day. But to the manner&#xD;
in which I've passed to-day,--". awoke quite late, -ead a ortion of&#xD;

o'clock, as usual; it is so vulgar to eat like common people, and&#xD;
then I couldnot relish my food with steel forks, that is very common,&#xD;
I prefer silver. But I forgot a circumstance that happened to me&#xD;
last evening: As I was escorting Araniinta to her carriage, a man&#xD;
stepped on my patents and soiled them; the man appeared embarrased&#xD;
and begged my pardon; but I looked very fierce at him when I saw&#xD;

of hearing Arry tell her friend, how courageously I acted.".&#xD;
"Well Tim, you will soon propose, will you not ?.1"&#xD;
" Aw, yes, I shall bring matters to a close, shortly. Women are&#xD;
truely Angels, and always tell the truth so delightfully. Arry com-&#xD;
plimented me on my distinguished appearance, and said I looked&#xD;
pale and interesting ;-the, secret was, that afternoon I had cleared&#xD;
my complexion with Hauel .admirable reparation. Really that&#xD;
Hauel is a benefactor to mankind. On Friday even Araminta&#xD;
will be.mine." -..&#xD;
"So soon, faith Pillington you are a lucky dog."  Ejaculated&#xD;
Livingston and Mortimore in the same breath.&#xD;
"I shall propose at the Opera."&#xD;
*" Between the acts? could not select a more suitable or happier&#xD;
place." said Mortimore. Livingston smiled, but said nothing.&#xD;
" She has an excessive passion for the Opera, and at it she is so&#xD;
elated,. that she will grant almost .any request made. I shall avail&#xD;
myself of her most liberal and good-natured mood, when excited by&#xD;
the music; and ask her to be mine."&#xD;
"Charming, you cannot fail to possess her fortune and her hand."&#xD;

CHAPTER XU.&#xD;
THE DREAD.&#xD;
On the morning following Juan's. engagement for her Majesty's&#xD;
Theatre, at Madrid, he entered the apartment of his friend, his mind&#xD;
evidently charged with some matter which made a deep impression.&#xD;
And after their usual'preliminaries of the day, had sociably subsided,&#xD;
Jnan began:&#xD;
. "Hve you an faith in dreams, Sinclair ?"&#xD;
"iNot much,".Sinclair smiled. Sometimes they may -foreshadow&#xD;
coming events, I beleive they have been given as premonitors; but&#xD;
they are not always to be relied upon as true. Why do you ask~so&#xD;
singular a question ?"-&#xD;
" I have had a dream, so singular, yet startling ; and which has&#xD;
wrought such an effect upon my mind, that the impression seems&#xD;
stamped indelibly there. Would you hear my dream "&#xD;
."tIf you please, for now I perceive it has indeed produced an&#xD;
effect on you since yesterday; are you not ill ?"&#xD;
,"Not ill; but allow me to-tell my dream."&#xD;
" Most willingly ; I am all attention, procede."&#xD;
" Last night, Sinclair, I saw Cecelia, clearly as-I,ever beheld her&#xD;
in my life.~ She was attired in white, and was kneeling, I thought&#xD;
at the feet of that base villian, Lawrence, Livingston. I heard her&#xD;
intreat him to redeem his promise; which he made to me-to her,&#xD;
when he was in my power.-For the sake of humanity, for the love&#xD;
of Heaven, and the unborn innocent, quickening in her bosom. She&#xD;
prayed him to save her from self-reproach and shame, to redeem&#xD;
his promise and make, her his wife. But with a withering curl' on&#xD;
hislip and a frown on his brow, he rudely spurned -hdr from him&#xD;
. yes Sinclair, while she yet clung to his feet, and with the deep&#xD;
intensity of woman's love, covered his hands with kisses, and implored&#xD;
him not to desert her-not to leave her to misery-to the scorn and&#xD;
contempt of the scornful, to the bitterness of self-reproach. Her&#xD;
long, dark hair, clustered over her prostrate figure, and her soft, eyes&#xD;
filled with tears, were turned upon him, as the quivering dove, tuins&#xD;
in its agony, its last gaze upon the vulture that destroys its life : 3 et&#xD;
he coldly spurned her with his foot, turned on his heel, and left her&#xD;
so her fate. That moment I would have sprang upon and strangled&#xD;
him,-but oh,. Sinclair, that scene to me was real; I felt all the&#xD;
indescribable horror, that I should have endured, had I been inclosed&#xD;
in a room with them alone, and witnessed it with my natural eyes-&#xD;
I would have destroyed him with a single effort, my will was good,&#xD;
but--I lacked the physical'strength, an indescribable weakness, like&#xD;
water, took -possession of my body, and I- seemed debared by an&#xD;
inevitable decree from him, forever.- For several minutes I lay&#xD;

upon my couch in the greatest mental anguish, ! felt the cold perspi.&#xD;
ration, rolling down from my forehead, and my face, and presently&#xD;
it started from all parts of my body; I trembled, and became chilled.&#xD;
At-length I grew' comparatively calm, sad saw them again ; and&#xD;
this time under circumstances more painful, if possible than the&#xD;
former. I beheld them near, a d4ep stream of water; again she&#xD;
was weeping at his feet. He gathered her up in his arms, evidently&#xD;
with some devilish-intent ; she begged him to spare her life ; and in&#xD;
her struggles-to get free, he 'stumbled, and she fell from him to the&#xD;
ground. She had fainted; she layfor a moment unconscious, and&#xD;
pale-as the whitest marble. The place was lonely, on each side of&#xD;
the dark, deep stream, the.thickly foliaged forest started the shore.&#xD;
He glanced rapidly around him, then hurriedly snatching her from&#xD;
the;green earth; he bore her to the brink, and ere she revived, with&#xD;
a powerful, murderous effort, he plunged her beneath the everlasting&#xD;
waters  But, 0, Sinclair! Abis was not al),, I was doomed to see&#xD;
her once more;'I thought the sudden plunge revived her paralyzed&#xD;
sences,and with a wild andifearful shriek she sprang upwards. She&#xD;
would have grasped the boat into which bewhad leaped,; but fiend.&#xD;
like, he struck her with the oar, and she sank to rise no more. Her&#xD;
innocent blood, purpled the waters momentarily, marking them as&#xD;
the 'fatal spot where she went down. Sinclair, at the sight, my blood&#xD;
rushed boiling and foaming through my brain; not content with&#xD;
defiling her, he had 'now imbued his hands- in her blood, he was her&#xD;
murderer. - My grasp was on his throat, and I felt the vile wretch&#xD;
twist and writhe like a reptile at my mercy. Mercy!1 in that hour&#xD;
I knew none. One effort like that of. an iron vice, and I felt every&#xD;
bone of his body crushed in my grasp; I awoke, my room was&#xD;
dark as Egypt's blackest night.' For a second, I lay reflecting, but&#xD;
I could not rest; I arose, obtained a light, and paced my room, I&#xD;
know not how long, for Ididnotthink of tirne,I only thought of Cecelia,&#xD;
and her probable fate.".&#xD;
"iAnd this you call a dream,, Juan you are surely romancing,; your&#xD;
imagination has. gained the mastery of your judgement. You but&#xD;
ftaincv-these things.n&#xD;
"Call it romance or fancy, or what you please. These things&#xD;
appeared to me last night, just as I have told you of them, and with&#xD;
such fearful effect ; God grant I may never be called to witness the&#xD;
like in reality. When I awoke, and found it but a dream, I really&#xD;
felt an inexpressible relief; and .yetSinclair, I fearthereis something&#xD;
more than a dream in this; I fear it -is; or will be sad reality: for&#xD;
you know that Livingston,;vis a villain capable of almost:any crime&#xD;
'But I again retired, and felloffinto fitful dozing.. I saw him again,&#xD;
'under circumstances though diffeT-ent, 'yet equally dark and fearful.&#xD;
He had fled-the city, and l became -thealeader of a. secretly leagued&#xD;

both high and low degree, from'vice in the pulpit, deception in the&#xD;

&#xD;
,&#xD;
&#xD;
-heavy, leaden hue, and in a spacious, dingy cave, I saw by the pale&#xD;
light of a single' lamp, a company of men of warm temperaments&#xD;
and diverse appearances ; among them, was Livingston. By the&#xD;
earnest air, which seemed to shroud them like a spell, 1 felt there&#xD;
was a deep scheme, or mystery at work in the heart of those thus&#xD;
secretly convened round a large table,on which lay writing; materials,&#xD;
and a number of partially written papers; while in another portion&#xD;
of the cave,. I saw a large crucifix overturned. As. L wondered.&#xD;
what their object could be, that they were thus assembled, in such&#xD;
a place, and on such a night,-the heavy rain was pouring down in&#xD;
torrents, the wind uprooting the stoutest' trees of the forest, and&#xD;
field, and twisting off fences, raged a horrible tempest. The deaf-&#xD;
ening thunders roared, rolled and-rattled along the globmy horizon,&#xD;
while the flashesand streams of lightning, hissed and played through&#xD;
the air, and along the ground, as - fiery serpents illummating with&#xD;
frightful sublimity the vivid scene. I thought their. plotting was&#xD;
againstthe uion of the Northern and Southern States. Their pretext&#xD;
for disolution, the subject of slavery. After perhaps an hour's delib-&#xD;
eration, they all solemly gathered round the rugged crucifix, and&#xD;
forming a, circle, each person simultainously-lifted his right hand to&#xD;
Heaven, and vowing eternal allegiance to each other, they swore to&#xD;
use all their cQmbined and individual efforts to' overthrow the con-&#xD;
federacy of 'the United States to separate forever, the South from&#xD;
Jie North. I, trembled at their oath, and while I yet looked, gazed&#xD;
upon a scene, the cold horror of which almost congealed my heart's&#xD;
blood,-by some invisible power, their uplifted hands had become&#xD;
motionless and stiff, and they were withered and shrivered to the&#xD;
bone, each of them still pointed to Heaven, The men were dumb,&#xD;
for though their lips still moved in blasphemous oaths, their tongues&#xD;
clove to the roof of their mouth ; while their fierce revolving, eyes,&#xD;
shot forth gleams of liquid fire, until each, ' straining ball of sight&#xD;
seemed bursting from their head.' With an intense horror, I gazed&#xD;
upon the scene before me ; presently I saw a thin, blueish smoke,&#xD;
ooze out from their bodies, and curling above them, for several&#xD;
minutes hid them from view, as it were, by a thin, vaporous mist.&#xD;
'It cleared away, and the forms of the men still standing, their withered'&#xD;
hands still pointing Heavenward, had changed to an unearthly black-&#xD;
ness. Their eyes dropped from their sockets, their tongues consumed&#xD;
by an inward fire, fell from their mouth, and then their flesh turning&#xD;
a1ill blacker, drooped peacemeal from their bones, and left their dry&#xD;
b!tached skellitons, standing round the fallen crucifix, and their bony&#xD;
arns, hands and fingers, still pointing to Heaven. It was a strange,&#xD;
a saddening spectacle, and shuddering, I closed my eyes upon the&#xD;
scene. When I opened them again, all the former darkness of the&#xD;
conflicting elements had cleared away, and the, silvery moon sailing&#xD;
high in the Heavens, again gave light to the world, well nigh as&#xD;
refulgent as the sun at noon-day. Over the cave; I saw, as if suspended&#xD;
by the magnetic power of- attraction, the most brilliant constellation&#xD;
of stars, gleaming through the transparent atmosphere with au,&#xD;

eflblgence almost overpowering to the mortal vision of man ; in their&#xD;
-clear, bright' center, and drawn to his full height, stood the majestic&#xD;
father of his country ; his calm, benignant face, beaming forth in&#xD;
God-like integrity, his divine consciousness of justice. Sinclair you&#xD;
have seen the picture showing him on horseback, as he appeared at&#xD;
the eventful battle of Monmouth, where the majesty of his presence,&#xD;
his grandeur and. composure, stopped the retreat of his flying army.&#xD;
and his firmness, almost divine, fixed the most brillant victory of hi&#xD;
country's'arms. I have gazed upon that picture when alone, until&#xD;
the bright halo of calm courage and valiant enthusiasm, enwreathed&#xD;
his brow, and lighting the eye, has melted into divinity ; and as I&#xD;
gazed upon Washington, thought I gazed upon a god. - Such,indeed,&#xD;
Sinclair, he appeared to me last night, in the center of the bright&#xD;
constellation of the American states. With his sword drawn to&#xD;
command, he calmly pointed to a small black cloud in the Southern&#xD;
portion of the heavens, from the center of which, and in characters&#xD;
of liguid fire, glittered the warning-" Vengeance is mine, I will&#xD;
-epay saith the Lord."     .&#xD;
-"And this you call a dream." Said Duval, when Juan had&#xD;
.recovered from the intense agitation consequent upon the recital of&#xD;
his almost increditable vision. " It is truly startling, but for the life&#xD;
of me Juan, I cannot rid myself of the thought that you must be&#xD;
romancing."-&#xD;
" Sinclair, ws my fate for the truth, to be that of thedisunionists&#xD;
in the cave beneath the the burning vengeance of Heaven-I remem-&#xD;
her correctly,-all the minutia of the ,scenes, as the strange panorama&#xD;
of them passed before me last night, I could not shut it out. and&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII..&#xD;
DECEPriON.&#xD;
One month later, -Antonia Capello received a letter stamped&#xD;
from a popular post betwixt Spain and the United States. On&#xD;
-receiving the letter he hastened to his library, and after securing&#xD;
himself from intrusion, broke the seal' and read in substance as&#xD;
follows:&#xD;
February 23, 18-&#xD;
Signor Antonio Capello&#xD;
Dear Sir.--your instructions have&#xD;
been fully carried out, and Juan is now carefully guarded on his&#xD;
rapid way to Peru. He gave us- some trouble in his transhipment,&#xD;
from my vessel to the one bearing him thither. The proposed change&#xD;
led him to suspect something not quite in accordance with his previous&#xD;
arrangement ; but we soon quieted him with chains and hand cuffs,&#xD;
not, however, until through his efforts in the drama, he succeeded in&#xD;
knocking one of our best men. overboad. Your favor is duly&#xD;
received ; thanks.&#xD;
&#xD;
Yours Truly,&#xD;
&#xD;
Capt. Don Jose.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ha ! ha ! Juan in a silver mine of Peru, makes me at least one&#xD;
hundred thousand dollars richer in security and comfort. Ah, Jose&#xD;
you are an accomplished villian, and are deserving of a gener&#xD;
alship for this last act alone. Juan in'Peru, secures to me a very&#xD;
respectful distance from the murderous scoundrel; thanks to the&#xD;
favoring tide, Dafrone and Capt. Jose, the thing is ' finally done,'&#xD;
and I am free from care."&#xD;
Thus chuckledCapello,overthe few lineswhich gave himnsuch assur&#xD;
ance of his son's new bondage; while the afflicted and bruised.Juan&#xD;
groaned beneath the heavy shuckles with which he was loaded, 'and&#xD;
forced as a menial into a servitude more galling, if possible, than&#xD;
the worst phase of Southern slavery. Driven down, hundreds of&#xD;
feet beneath the surface of the earth and compelled to toil on con-&#xD;
stantly, day and night,, without the remotest hope of escape. Such&#xD;
was Juan's fate in one of the deepest mines of Peru.&#xD;
Another month after he had been thus shackled, his unnatural&#xD;
father received a large box of valuables, which was taken. from&#xD;
ship-board, and carefully deposited by the drayman before Capello's&#xD;
door on a fine afternoon in balmy April. A note was then placed&#xD;
in his hands, hastily receiving which, he hurriedly summoned three&#xD;
or four of. his vassels to convey the box into a large, private room&#xD;
devoted especially to the storage of such goods. Capello had settled&#xD;

with the drayman, and entered the westward room to await t-4&#xD;
deposit of the box there.&#xD;
"What am dis ye have yar, Sam?7 Enquired one of the blacks of&#xD;
a companion, as he descended the verandah.&#xD;
You, ya, don't know Cezar, 0cept its more valuables. Phew,&#xD;
golly, its putty heavy anyhow." Saidhe, as trying to raise'it, he&#xD;
left the edge of the box drop very nearly on his feet.&#xD;
"Clar out, you wooly-leadyou ;weak, you can't lift nothing, let'&#xD;
me try it.'  Broke in a stout athletic negro.of the four.&#xD;
He seized the box, and raising it some inches from the ground,&#xD;
was boasting to his grinning companions, of his success and skill,&#xD;
as Capello stood in the door frowning at their attempts.&#xD;
What are you at there, you black rascals, bring me that box&#xD;
here irpmediately, or I'll horsewhip every one of you."&#xD;
"They all seized the box, and in three minutes more it was safely&#xD;
deposited in the desired place.-,&#xD;
"Now," said he, " tose the door, and open that back window,&#xD;
and here Ciezar, take ths hatchet and let me see how carefully and&#xD;
quickly you can open this box."                   f&#xD;
Cezar, took the hatchet, and in ten minutes more, had the top off&#xD;
the box and a portion of the packing material emptied out upon the&#xD;
floor. And there in the box reposed carefully- packed, not a live&#xD;
negro, nor the returned Juan, but a complete set of massive silver&#xD;
plate; received by Capello from Peru, in exchange for his son. The&#xD;
negroes scarcely knowing the nature, or rather the value of the&#xD;
articles, but merely thinking them something "valerable," looked&#xD;
seriously at each other, and waited in silence, their master's pleasure.&#xD;
The plate was removed to a secure place, and afew days subsequently,-&#xD;
Capello's mansion was the gay scene of one of the most brilliant&#xD;
banquets or soirees ever convened in Charleston. At it were ^*&#xD;
assembled over twenty members of his secret league, and many of&#xD;
his, and his daughter's lady acquaintances of the city. And thus the&#xD;
articles purchased by the bondage of Juan,-the rich, littering&#xD;
gobblets conveyed the wine to the= lips of his foes, and the other&#xD;
articles, dazzled beneath the many rich viands of the season, were&#xD;
the subject of pleasure and remark among those who had so cruelly&#xD;
conspired against him. But to avoid proving tedious to the reader,&#xD;
we must again change the scene, and note events of a different nature&#xD;
the past, occurring in another portion of the city.&#xD;
It was a bright morning in the early part of April, and while yet&#xD;
the celestial streakings of the rising sun had scarce begun to tip the&#xD;
kity peaks of the eastern hills, and the chimes of St. S,.--were&#xD;
sending forth their inviting peals, Iong ere they ceased, a female,&#xD;
entered the large gateway leading to te proud lofty church, penitent&#xD;
and sid. She' passed into the vestry, with humble down-cast looks,&#xD;
and pressed towards the confessional, confessor Melville was waiting .&#xD;
the penitent maiden approached and poured her soul of sincere con&#xD;
fession into his listening ear., Her voice,. sinless as her own soul&#xD;
stimed silvery and musical as the pure breathing of an angel. He-.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WHITE SLAVEOw&#xD;
became deeply interested, and thought his first devotee of the.morning&#xD;
was indeed a celestial from the upper world, for whose confession he&#xD;
could form no penance. At a glance he ,drank in more of beauty&#xD;
and real, loveliness, than we are capable of forming the rare being&#xD;
before him. The sun never shone upon one more heavenly and pure.&#xD;
His unrestrained passions,-at- the sight, grew inflamed. His foot&#xD;
pressed mechanicaly on a secret spring near the floor, when ; ick&#xD;
aZs the lightning she, was lowered down, down, far below the place&#xD;
where but a moment before,'she stood with innocent unsuspicious&#xD;
confidence. A. moment more and she was struggling in the arms&#xD;
of her-base confessor. But-maddened by the insult, and strengthened&#xD;
by the resolution of suddn.despair, not altogethe void of hope, she&#xD;
with one boldeffort, pushed him from her, while his foot catching&#xD;
the trail of his gown, he staggered and fell back heavily to the ground.&#xD;
She cried loudlyfor 'help, but' the thick prison-like walls that now&#xD;
inclosed her, were far too massive to be penetrated by her cries.&#xD;
Quickly she sprang in all parts of her inclosnre in hopes of finding&#xD;
some way of egress.,  In her wild flight she succeeded, as it were&#xD;
by accident, her foot struck a'spring near one side of the apartment&#xD;
and a small door quickly flew open before her, admitting into the&#xD;
dingy ground chamber a 'stream of light, that for a moment, with&#xD;
delightquite dazzled her sight. She sped joyfully through the welcome&#xD;
passage, and gained the street. Reaching her home, she scarcely&#xD;
Knew how, she kept her room 'closely for several days. Confessor&#xD;
Melvillerevived, and at lengthquite.abashed, arose from hishumiliating&#xD;
posture. Groaning deeply inspirit, he heartily bewailed the unpleas-&#xD;
ant dilemma into which 'his weakness or rather wickedness had&#xD;
involved him.&#xD;
"Ah, I-should have silenced her while she was in my power,"&#xD;
he muttered in regret. "Tush, I have made a bungling commence-&#xD;
ment in my new calling. ,Foiled for once,--she-has escaped, and&#xD;
will expose me; my only security now, is flight, flight !"&#xD;
This wolf in sheeps clothing was Mulford Melville, alias Lawrence&#xD;
Livingston, the murderer of Juan's sister, Cecelia. His intended&#xD;
victim, this time, was.the lovely Adelia Duval.&#xD;
But during the same 'time another scene progresses. On a little&#xD;
frequented road, between the, city of Charleston and Columbia, a&#xD;
handsome young lady is sporting on a fine sorrel pacer, her favorite&#xD;
amusement and pastime, equestrianism.= Nearing a thickly, foliaged&#xD;
wildwood, by the road-side, she carelessly gave the reins to the&#xD;
animals neck, and herself strangely up to a reverie of pensive&#xD;
reflections. She thought of her kind old uncle who had lately made&#xD;
the present of the beautiful animal on which she was sitting. ,She&#xD;
thought of him whom she loved yet, dearest than all, and for' a&#xD;
moment -repined at the strange fate which seemed tokeep them&#xD;
separate so long. A single tear coursed down over her cheek and&#xD;
fluttered off unheeded in the'passing breeze. Suddenly the coming&#xD;
locomotive sent forth a loud and far-echoing blast, which frightened&#xD;
her horse, he bounded away at a fear gedlIop, She-grasped for&#xD;

&#xD;
the loosened reins, but missing them, clung only to his flashing mane,&#xD;
now whipping and snapping in the wind. Her hat flew off, and her&#xD;
hair becoming unbound. streamed in the wind in flowing luxuriance.&#xD;
She grasped again for the lost reins, but the sudden jerk with which&#xD;
she seized' them, turned the animal over into a large field, where-&#xD;
reminding one of Mazeppa's firery steed,-=he fled away yet fiere&#xD;
than before. On, and yet on he strode ovdr the field, endangering&#xD;
'every moment, the more, the life of his precious charge. But starting&#xD;
from the'thicket, bordering on the road-side, another enters upon the&#xD;
chase, and flies over the field in rapid and splendid stride. 'Tis a&#xD;
chase for life and love, for on the pursuing steed, sits him of whom&#xD;
she thought, when her own trusty, steed: took to flight. He had&#xD;
recognized in the fair one in danger, his late betrothed; and now&#xD;
skins over the plane in ursuit, swift indeed, as the wind. A white&#xD;
  belt of light gleams in te distance, it is the river, and hope in his&#xD;
breast whispers wildly, of this as the goal of their mad flight. A&#xD;
moment more, and his iereing glance, discvers between them 'and&#xD;
the alluring 'stream, a horrible chasm yawning darkly to receive&#xD;
them in a mangling death. With an impulsive shudder he drove his&#xD;
spurs into his faithful steed, which starts him in the chase to his&#xD;
utmost speed. He called to Louisa, she looked up, and catching a&#xD;
glimpse of her imineint danger, uttered a piercing scream, and but&#xD;
clung closer to the saddle. For a second his heart sank within him&#xD;
but it was not the time to despair. Another moment and all will be&#xD;
lost, a moment more and both horse and his fair rider will be-dashed&#xD;
to pieces, and find a gloomy tomb at the dark bottom of a rugged&#xD;
abyss. Once more he arose in his saddle, and driving his spurs into&#xD;
the foaming flanks of his trembling steed, he dashed against the&#xD;
breast of the runaway, on the very verge of the precipice, which&#xD;
while it quivered and crumbled beneath their feet her animal checked&#xD;
by the shock, sprang aloft on his hindmost feet, when the saddle&#xD;
girth broke assunder,. and Louisa Duval fell back to the earth stunned&#xD;
to almost insensibility. Her horse, in leaping front his haunches&#xD;
again, sprang over the precipice, and falling, dashed himself to&#xD;
pieces against tho rocks below ; he was dead and weltering in blood,&#xD;
--but Louisa was saved; young Marston wheeled his horse about,&#xD;
leaped off, and stood over her a moment, in the deepest solicitude.&#xD;
There she reposed, pale as the whitest marble, saved from a horrible&#xD;
death, as -though but to.sleep oi fprever upon the summit of a moun-&#xD;
tain tomb. He felt her pulse, a weak beat yet told of a spark of&#xD;
remaining life, and hope, almost despair, revived. He seized her in&#xD;
his arms, and remounting with her, in his saddle, retraced his course&#xD;
over the field some two miles distant to her father's house. But&#xD;
leaving her thus in the tender care of her parents and her lover, we&#xD;
must again change the scene of our story.         -&#xD;
" Well, comrades, what think you by this time of our success with&#xD;
Monsieur Melville, will he join us ?' Interrogated Martinar address-&#xD;

a reserved portion of New Orleans.&#xD;

as I believe he will, he has keen tried of late by several of us ; so&#xD;
that with a little judicious perseverance, I think we will have hi'n&#xD;

Replied Dafrone.&#xD;
"That is well-we may succeed then, but think you Monsieur&#xD;
Dafrone, he will come to-night ?"&#xD;
" He will." Responded promptly and firmly, a new voice, as&#xD;
removing his. disguise, the villainous Melville, stepped forth from the&#xD;
promiscuously assembled men. " I am here noble sirs, and await&#xD;
your pleasure."&#xD;
All started at cthe unning and effectual surprise. His hand was&#xD;
grasped warmly by many of them, and  all proclaimed him quite an&#xD;
accomplished member. They felt proud of his evident ability to&#xD;
deceive and play the, jesuit adroitly.&#xD;
"Give me your hand, Monsieur Melville."  Said Martinan, the&#xD;
spokesman of that division of the " League."&#xD;
"It is yours Signor Martin4n, and with it my heart also."  Replied&#xD;
the accomplished villian, extending his hand. The peculiar -and&#xD;
requisite preparation was now made to initiate Melville fully into the&#xD;
secrets of the Order of "Jeshurune."  He signed his life-for the&#xD;
promotion of their domination and rule. Another general congratula-&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
S4RIUAGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Subsequent to Juan's departure from the city, but a few interviews&#xD;
on the part of the youthful Duval,  with the ardent Beatrise, served&#xD;
to rekindle with a far warmer glow, their previous limited affection&#xD;
for each other. Their attachment grew sincere and they were soon&#xD;
betrothed ; they were married. Signor Capello, despite his common&#xD;
though fashionable follies, loved his proud daughter with a degree of&#xD;
tenderness truly praiseworthy and amiable. Sinclair Duval was an&#xD;
only son. Both families were rich, and the -immense wealth of each&#xD;
seemedto be brought in conjunction in order to make the proud wedding&#xD;
of the two loved ones, a brilliant display,, seldom surpassed or even&#xD;
equalled for extravagance and splendor, among the aristocracy of&#xD;
the South, oreven the nobility of Old Spain.&#xD;
Married amid the dazzling cortege of her father's mansion, her&#xD;
ay guests and smiling admirers, though numerous were select ; But&#xD;
Beatrice appeared a Queen among them all. We neednot stay to&#xD;
extol the orient-like banquet, the flashing of wines and the immense&#xD;
glitter of the freshly imported silver ware. But leaving the bride&#xD;
and groom, inexpressibly happy, we hasten on to note among others&#xD;
an event occuring some three months subsequent to the glad wedding&#xD;
The sudden death of Arrabella, mother of Sinclair Duval, came tc&#xD;
them like a sad knell from the other world. Pleased with the evident&#xD;
happiness of the newly wedded, their house had been the gay scene&#xD;
of joy and feasting ; but now,that same mansionis thegroom shrouded&#xD;
enclosure, of a scene how vastly different-death. The brightest&#xD;
feature of good in the noble character of Sinclair Duval, was his&#xD;
love for his mother. And not having yet cast aside his bridal attire,&#xD;
he followed with his weeping bride, his mother to the tomb, in gloom.&#xD;
Nine months more, and the mansion of Elmer-Duval, at Charleston,&#xD;
was owned by him no more.-. He sold it, and with it a large portion&#xD;
of his slaves. The ensuing autumn, he expended more than half his&#xD;
wealth, inthe exciting political contest then raging for the disolution of&#xD;
the union. It is net necessary to say that the union survived the stormy&#xD;
conflict while Duvalwas compelledto turnhisplantation near Charleton&#xD;
into cash. Signor Capello- was the purchaser, by which he came&#xD;
into the possession of an additional number of slaves. He also&#xD;
grew interested in thececession strife, but betting in the issue, simply&#xD;
one of his favoriteQuadroons, and fifty of his plantation negroes, his&#xD;
loss did not proveso great as that of Duvals.;&#xD;
Twelve months more have passed away, and though prolific with&#xD;
gloomy and conflicting events, they now lie buried deep in the vaulted&#xD;
past. Our scene changes to a quiet and reserved portion of the city&#xD;
New Orleans; the season is pleasant and a most lovely morning&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WITE SLAVE.                    73&#xD;
in 1ay. The sun just rising and striking aslant the half parted&#xD;
blinds at the windows of the quiet marnsion house, seems to sport in&#xD;
gay, fantastic rays, with his own bright beams, forming at once a&#xD;
halo of brilliance, pleasing ad' cheerful. In the center of this scin-&#xD;
tillation, and bathed in the perfumed light, smiles a lovely babe, just&#xD;
having dropped into the hands of its mother, from the gentle source&#xD;
of its happiness and nourishment. How sweetly for a few moments&#xD;
doesit repose in the shielding arms of the mother, as in a girdle of&#xD;
holiest love. The happy mother once more radiant with health,&#xD;
seems watching the sleeping innocence of her fiat born, with the&#xD;
.vigilance of an Angel, while smiling by her, side,, sits the happy&#xD;
father. They are Sinclair and Beatrice. A few evenings subsequent&#xD;
a scene quite different progresses. .&#xD;
"Melville, you seem a lucky fellow, having executed that flourish&#xD;
upon Duval's estates pretty well, what think you now, of'attempting&#xD;
that little business up town, there eh ?" The speaker was Dafrone.&#xD;
" Well, were it not for one thing, I would be prepared to undertake it&#xD;
forthwith." Melville replied approaching with two or three assistants,&#xD;
nearer to Dafrone. " But as it is, I think we shall have to defer it&#xD;
a little, for you know Dafrone, I wish to make.a finished piece of&#xD;
work of it. His silver and gold. alone, will never satisfy me, but&#xD;
hark ye, we must manage to bear away his wife, also, for she would&#xD;
prove a charming acquisition to our cQmpahy. By the way, Signors,&#xD;
come nearer, did I ever tell you-of a pretty Miss I once possessed&#xD;
in Charleston ? But what is one, many have I engaged since, believe&#xD;
me ; but hush, a little affair proved against me, ifazied; she escaped&#xD;
me, which hastened my flight to his place. But a truce to the past,&#xD;
the present and the future are ours."&#xD;
" Aye, the present, Monsieur." Answered the listeners in the same&#xD;
breath.&#xD;
"I was saying we should have the wife with us."&#xD;
" But can it be done without much risk ? Is there any one moment&#xD;
more propitious than another ?"&#xD;
"Yes, hearken, I have ascertained that there are seasons when he&#xD;
is called away on business to New York, or Boston or-it matters&#xD;
not where. But if we can with equal certainty hit'upon the season&#xD;
of his absence we are safe and secure of his old and wife."&#xD;
'A good plan, and well given, Monsieur. Replied Dafrone.&#xD;
The other listeners drew  closer round him; but after as few&#xD;
moments.more of consultation, at Melville's suggestion they separated&#xD;
for the evening, himself taking Dafrone by the arm, they walked&#xD;
away, and in ten minutes entered a cafe where they further matured&#xD;
their plans over the exhilerating fumes of a social little banquet.&#xD;
But'we think, sudden as his transformation may have been, the reader&#xD;
cannot fail to see in Monsieur Melville, alias Lawrence Livingston&#xD;
the" finished villian."&#xD;

the purest principles of democracy in the New World. Democracy&#xD;
in name merely, they ,fear not, but 'tis its pure spirit against which&#xD;
they strive,; succeeding in this we'need'scarcely predict the Anarchal&#xD;
consequences that must follow in-thedread wake of such a disaster.&#xD;
Their evening we have alluded to, was one of especial. interest,&#xD;

at a ;period when t" Secession";was rag ingthe hotest, to them itwas&#xD;

tenacity in their argument, savoring more of an out and out quarrel&#xD;
than a mere debate for pass-time. They grew warmer and warmer,&#xD;
while the vivid lighteing flashed in their faces, with a purple and&#xD;
a bluish glow; their countenances whitened with rage at each other,&#xD;
and a number of the company, not to witness the unpleasant quarrel,&#xD;
quietly withdrew, while those that remained failed entirely to pacify&#xD;
or seperate the contestants. Their language grew harsh, eveh tounbear&#xD;

On a cloudy night in the month of October, and in the wealthy&#xD;
portion Qf the Crescent .city, tree rien cad ii dark apparel, their&#xD;
heads and faces shrouded in cowls, might have been seen prowling&#xD;
abouta lrgemodern mansion,alongside of which,occupying the entire&#xD;
-                                          front, a beautiful piazza extended in good old Southern style, whil&#xD;
at the side or right wing, a large yard, or more properly a garden,&#xD;
spread out before you, a beautiful prpspect of fruit trees, ppd flowers&#xD;
of every eq9or.and perfume.&#xD;
During the after part of the day, considerable rain had fallen, and&#xD;
the atmosphere around our rosy retreat, seemed ad re with the&#xD;
richest perf ure.&#xD;
One of the three men, Ainally stepped up to the side entragee, and&#xD;
fin g it unfastened, they all entered cautiously, and proceeded to the&#xD;
rear of the quiet mansion.&#xD;
" It smells sweet in here."  Whispered one to the other, as they&#xD;
walked along the rose andbopglocd bordered walk, leaving which,&#xD;
to theirrights few more steps brought them to the rearmnain entrance.&#xD;
The leader quietly tried the door, and found it fast, he moved along&#xD;
to another, which was also fist; he tried another. it ylded to i&#xD;
presure.&#xD;
t' Hearken, comrades," he whispered.  Either the trs are pro-&#xD;

&#xD;
weapons drawn, they all entered stealthily, crossed the first' room&#xD;
and paused, when the leader partially opening a dark lantern, in an&#xD;
under tone'said: &#xD;
" We all know our errand here; I beleive he is absent, now we&#xD;
must first ascertain where she is, and if asleep well; while I content&#xD;
myself with her, you will search the house, and return by the time&#xD;
I am ready to decend. There can be no snare, be fearless anrd&#xD;
brave."&#xD;
They commenced to ascend the spacious stair-way, the soft, pliable&#xD;
brussels of which, gave back not the least sound of their stealthy&#xD;
approach. On they passed, scrutinizing closely as they gained the&#xD;
suit of costly furnished apartments on the second floor. Pausing&#xD;
a moment before a half open door, the leader, was about to spring&#xD;
his lantern abain; but it was useless to do so, for as he carefully&#xD;
opened the c amber-door. his gaze met a sufficiency of light for a l&#xD;
his dark purposes. He pressed the door ajar, and thievissly glared&#xD;
in; the light had nearly burned away. He turned towards the couch&#xD;
and there lay the calm sleeping wife, unconscious of the close prox-&#xD;
imity of the abducting Fiend chuckling with inward triumph, so&#xD;
near her. In her protective embrace slept her darling infant. The&#xD;
fiend peered further in, then drew back and in commanding tones&#xD;
whispered to his two comrades:   .&#xD;
"What you do, do quickly, get all you can, and hasten to return."&#xD;
Taking the lantern, they disappeared; but after the absence of&#xD;
about thirty minutes, he feasted his gloating eyes on the rich masses&#xD;
of gold and silver ware, jewellry, &amp;amp;c. "'Tis well," he said, and&#xD;
glided into the quiet Chamber of his innocent victim. With the-&#xD;
stealthy step of a cat, he crouched towards the head of the richly&#xD;
cunained couch, drew forth a small plaster, and pressed it quick,&#xD;
and hard over her mouth and face. The shock awakened her, she&#xD;
opened her eyes, but closed them instantly aoain in utter darkness&#xD;
and unspeakable horror; and while she writhed and struggled in&#xD;
painful convulsions, he raised her in his strong arms, and hastily bore&#xD;
her from the room. She attempted to scream, but could not, and&#xD;
she trembled and shivered in his vice-like grasp, as he carried her&#xD;
down the stairs, followed by his accomplices. Tramp, tramp, they"&#xD;
reached the yard, and were bolting clumsily,though stealthily enough&#xD;
through, just as a figure emerged suddenly and hastily, from the&#xD;
darkness of the opposite side of the quiet street, and encountered&#xD;
them at the gateway.&#xD;
" Who goes there?" He exclaimed loudly.&#xD;
"Sacre !" Gritted the foremost one of the three in rage.&#xD;
" Speak quick, or I'll fire," the stranger continued. Just at that&#xD;
moment, the affrighted woman, forcing the plaster from her mouth,&#xD;
uttered a loud shriek.&#xD;
"Draw and sheath your daggers in his heart." Commanded the&#xD;
leader robber, ,in foaming anger.&#xD;
" Beatrice I" exclaimed the stranger, and ere they could . draw&#xD;
with success agaii t rim, fired, ar4 her abductor fell across the&#xD;
&#xD;
avenue, dead, without a groin. At that instant, the moon sailing&#xD;
from behind a cloud, cast hersilvery light athwart theiisavagely drawn&#xD;
weapons. With madness and a howl, they rushed upon him, but&#xD;
ere they could harm him, he had fired again; and at the fourth dis-&#xD;
charge, the three assassins lay bleeding at his feet, and his rescued&#xD;
wife fainting at his side.&#xD;
Bearing her in his arms, he entered his dwelling in the greatest&#xD;
consternation; the servants were just being aroused, and all was&#xD;
confusion and. excitement. Leaving his wife in the care of his&#xD;
servants, he seized a light and hastened out to the scene of blood and&#xD;
death. There lay beside the three corpses their plunder, scattered&#xD;
about the avenue and yard. When he returned to his wife, she had&#xD;
recovered from the fearful effect of her fright. They were soon&#xD;
joined by two or three of the patrol, who having heard the firing,&#xD;
hastened with considerable difficulty in finding the place, of the&#xD;
scene of distress. Stumbling over the dead bodies, they entered the&#xD;
dwelling, and received in brief detail, the true phase of the matter&#xD;
from the husband, Sinclair Duval, as he had found it on his return.&#xD;
The consequence was, that by a coroner's jury he was fully acquitted,&#xD;
it-being sustained that he acted solely in self-defence, in the protection&#xD;
of his wife and his property.&#xD;
True, as the robbers had surmised, Sinclair was absent, but they&#xD;
little thought, that by his anxious wife, his return was hourly expected,&#xD;
hence the rear entrance lleing left unfast, and the burning lamp&#xD;
was in the wife's chamber awaiting him. He thus returned in the&#xD;
proper nick af time, hence the attack and defence as we have given&#xD;
it. The stolen gold and jewelry, was taken care of. and the three&#xD;
men examined. The first one uncloaked was M. Dafrone, the&#xD;
Jesuit and Secessionist; the second was a' younger man, a member&#xD;
also of the" League." They approached the third, who wore not&#xD;
only a cloak, but a dark mask also. Removing the cloak, theylifted&#xD;
the mask from his pallid face; his attire was black, while a soiled&#xD;
white cravat, circling his neck, contrasted strangely with his dingy&#xD;
disguise, and the plundering circumstances, under which. he was&#xD;
found. As they passed the light still closer to his death-marbled&#xD;
face :-&#xD;
" Heavens !" Exclaimed Beatrice in the greatest surprise, "how&#xD;
is this, what means this mystery ? Lawrence Livingston a bandit&#xD;
a thief, an outlaw ? just Heaven, how changed 1"&#xD;
It was true, the unmasked assassin and plunderer, disclosed unmis.&#xD;
takably, the features, and person of her old acquaintance, Lawrence&#xD;
Livingston, the murderer of Cecelia, the accomplished roue, and&#xD;
priestly hypocrite, alias Milford Melville. All were astonished, but&#xD;
after their surprise had abated, the three men were quietly buried,&#xD;
as malefactors deserve.&#xD;
Within a small inclosure of wild-briar and thickly foliaged .trees,&#xD;
situated near the romantic borders.of the Ashly river, and within a&#xD;
mile of the city of Charleston ; two men met for duel, the cause of&#xD;

extended Timothy his pistol, whieh the latter relieved timidly, letting&#xD;
it almost drop, soon as it tonehedlhis hand.&#xD;
".Tut, tut, Titn, it is time to be in earnest, and lay aside this&#xD;
trifling, for I don't want you shot on my hands, no how."  Said&#xD;
Muzzy reproaehfully.&#xD;
.Goodness, gracious, Muzzy, I have not thought till this moment,&#xD;
this is the first time I ever handled a pistol , O, Muzzy, Muzzy, is&#xD;
there no other way to settle this ?"&#xD;
" There is i but Tim you have got to fight now, as you have pro-&#xD;
gressed so far.. You shall not trile with me in this manner, get me&#xD;
to come out here to aet as your second, simply to exhibit your own&#xD;
cowardice, and make an ass of me. No, Tim, you must fight."&#xD;
0, iny God, Muzy ; think, I have never fired a pistol in my&#xD;
life. 0, if Arry only knew this, it would prove her death. o,&#xD;
Muzzy, Muzzy, what is that word that quieted the late slave agitation&#xD;
in congress ?"&#xD;
' Compromise, you fool !"&#xD;
"Compromise, that will settle this afihir, without us shooting one&#xD;
another ; tell him Mui, I don't ;*ant to shoot him, tell him I will&#xD;
coinprotiiise."_&#xD;
"How      can von omtproise honorably? the question of dispute&#xD;

-or life, to whoever possesses her. .Are you willing to relinquish her&#xD;
giving up forever al claim upon her'!i you are, then I've' nodoubt&#xD;

-Relinquish Aramintal! no Muzzy, never, Araminta or death;&#xD;

The ,time was called, and the weapons levelled at each other.&#xD;
Timothy trembled from head to foot. The word was given, and&#xD;
Timothy reeled and fellto the earth, fortunately, unharmed, though&#xD;
he knew not whether he was dead-or alive, hi had fainted completely&#xD;
away. Darnell also,-remained unsohattered, Timothy's ball having&#xD;
passed through the cap of Harry's second. Mortimore ran to',the&#xD;
relief of his friend, and asertaining hastily, that he was not wounded;&#xD;
he dashed nearly the entire contents of the brandy bottle in his face,&#xD;
and bathed his temples and brow, until he revived. . The first words&#xD;
that arose to his lips, after he recovered, were---" 0, Arryl--1uzzy !'&#xD;

In a word, he lectured on Slavery, and assisted the slaves, when he&#xD;
could, to -escape. But on an occasion,-+subsequent to the duela~da&#xD;

anceremoniously struck in .the rear,-with arr article of wood, closely&#xD;
resembling a rail, in the hands of a company of the sporting, "baser&#xD;
sort." A  it struck Muzzy, it followed the well directed course of&#xD;
its conductor, and glancing aside,it appeared between his trembling&#xD;
pins," in the front, where it was ,seizedEby the other half of the&#xD;
companyand hastily elevated to their shoulders, allowing the lower&#xD;
extremities of Muzzy, dangling in the air, far above the hooting,&#xD;
huzzying crowd. Poor Muzzy, quivering in every fibre of his body,&#xD;
with fearful apprehension, grasped the rail, and clung to it with both&#xD;
hands for dear life, fearful of falling headlong to the street below,&#xD;
where, should he not kill himself in. the fall, he would run a great&#xD;
chance of being trampled to death by the aroused populace, who,&#xD;
both white and black, were following him with terrible bellowing&#xD;
confusion,.groans and hisses. Some laughed and jeered the fanatic&#xD;
abolishionists, while others, cursing him as ;the representative of the&#xD;
whole of them, threw stones, clubs, dead cats, and " bad eggs" at&#xD;
him, with a terrible vengeance, bruising his body in a painful manner;&#xD;
n-the midt of which, he yelled to them at the top of his voice, to&#xD;
only spare his life, and he would leave, and never desecrate their&#xD;
soil again. Amid a renewed rourid of huzza's, they suddenly stopped&#xD;
in the centre of a large field, without the least admonition, they let&#xD;
him drop to the ground, until he howled with very pain. But they&#xD;
seized and stripped his clothing from him, when two large negroes,&#xD;
taking thim by ;the shoulders and hair, and two more his feet, were&#xD;
commanded to plunge him in the large tub of, Tar, which had been&#xD;
freshly prepared to recieve him; it covered every inch of his body,&#xD;
nearly suffocating him.,. They then turned from the tar, and with&#xD;
the 'same grasp tossed him into a massive heap of small, light, downy&#xD;
feathers, and rolled him over and over, until they saw he could&#xD;
endure it no longer, when, they assisted him to his feet, and again&#xD;
elevated on the sharpest edge of the rail, where he presented indeed&#xD;
the novelest bird in all creation, the most ludicrous biped, ever feath-&#xD;
ered.. Their noise: an4V sport now was terrific, which they kept up&#xD;
with frightful clamor, :until they reached the river ; where, after&#xD;
making preparations to rescue him from drowning, they plunged him&#xD;
head first overboard; he struck the water with an awful plunge, and&#xD;
after sinking. twice, he was drawn out, and christened "Moses."&#xD;
As he once again struck on terra firma, he begged for his life most&#xD;
pitiously;--&#xD;
"Oh, for God's sake men, allow me to leave, do not kill me quite,&#xD;
let me go I".&#xD;
"That we are now ready to do, so prepare to obey orders, and&#xD;
never exhibit your ugly "mug," in South Carolina again."'&#xD;
".Never; '0, never." -Muzy gasped..    .&#xD;
" Well, now, right about face,,and stand do North ; .that's it, now&#xD;

He did "-locomote," fast as his feathered limbs would carry him.&#xD;
He ran, but whither he knew not, he only knew he was leaving his&#xD;
worst enemies ; so he sped on, on, over field after field, until he could&#xD;
proceed no further, but nearing a road, he sank down exhausted,&#xD;
beneath a large tree ; He groaned, and wept, and fell asleep.' Whe n&#xD;
he awoke,-the sun was shining down upon him, in all his meridian&#xD;
strength. He arose to his feet but his head ached to such a degree.&#xD;
that he reeled and fell against the tree, to the earth, where he lay i n&#xD;
unconsciousness- until- aroused by a teamster who chanced to pass.&#xD;
that way. He approached. him first with great caution, or to us o&#xD;
his own remark, he did not know, until he spoke, whether he was a&#xD;
human being, or a large bird resembling the Ostrich.'Muzzy aroused&#xD;
himself as well as he could, and informed the inquiring teamster of&#xD;
the cause of his present uninviting appearance. His first:prayer was&#xD;
for something to assist him to remove from him his unpleasant coat-&#xD;
ing of Tar. Water he knew would but add to its cohesion to his&#xD;
body; but the generous teamster readily suggested-a plan and an&#xD;
article, by which it could be removed; It was his pot of grease&#xD;
which he always carried swinging under his wagon, and which he&#xD;
proffered to Muzzy with his assistance to " peel" off the stuff. pro&#xD;
viding it did not delay him too long on the road. He commenced&#xD;
by besmearing the unfortunate Mortimore from head to foot with&#xD;
the grease, until, as he stood .erect, he glittered in the sun like a new&#xD;
"black mug."   At length, with a degree of joy, to Muzzy, of&#xD;
greater magnitude than that exhibited at his birth, they succeeded&#xD;
in releavine him- of nearly all of hid unenviable suit of black; but&#xD;
he was without clothing, the teamster, however, did all in his power&#xD;
to supply him, he gave him a pair of " Qveralls," with which the&#xD;
mortified Muzzy encased himself, took his leave of the good'teamster.&#xD;
and struck across the fields towards the nearest boat landing. in North&#xD;
Carolina. --It happened to he not so near as he had vainly hoped, for&#xD;
he travelled the remainder of the day without reaching it, and ight&#xD;
setting in, and there being no dwellings within sight, he once again&#xD;
betoook himself to the inviting shelter of a stately tree. Selecting&#xD;
the 'softest stone" he could find for a pillow, he once more latid&#xD;
him down exhausted, to:rest. The 'night, after drenching him with&#xD;
a good, refreshing, southern shower, of which, however, he knew&#xD;
nothing until next day,-passed away, and four or five hours of the&#xD;
following day. When he again opened his eyes, he looked dp, and&#xD;
not the bright canopy of -Heaven, nor the good old tree where he&#xD;
had lain-but the neatly white-washed ceiling of a comfortable&#xD;
chamber.&#xD;
" Where am I l" was his first thought. He attempted to raise up&#xD;
from the couch to'satisfy himself, but found himself so weakened by&#xD;
his late ill-luck, that he fell back powerless to the pillow. " My God1&#xD;
Pm somewhere, that's certain, and alive, but 0, how sick."&#xD;
A stranger approached the bed-side, in the person of a beautiful&#xD;
Quadroon slave. She was his attendant, appointed to take care of&#xD;
him, and minister to his wants.&#xD;

sail from New  Orleans, whither they were bound-the scenery&#xD;
around- them was picturesque beyond the power of language&#xD;
to portray-the whole company were on the deck of the Isabel,&#xD;
admiring the sublime beauties around them; on one side, or rather&#xD;
by themselves, stood Juan and Inez. Around them lay the broad&#xD;
expanse of waters, calm and unruffled as a glassy lake. From the.&#xD;
west the setting sun shone forth in a flood of Vermillion light, that&#xD;
sheetedthe Heavens apd4.the sea in a vast mirror of- pellucidbrillancy&#xD;
which tinted the skimming sea gull as ever and anon he darted up&#xD;
from the reflective waters, -with all the roseate mellowing lustre of&#xD;
the rainbow. An hour passed away, and the monarchof day, "behind&#xD;
the .light crimsoned hills of the west, sank proudly to rest."  The&#xD;
Isabel still sailed on, and steered quietly through the waters at a&#xD;
moderate rate. Presently, where the sun disappeared, a small&#xD;
dark cloud was seen to arise, and as it ascended to the arch of the&#xD;
darkning horizon, it gathered in blackness, thickened in density, nd&#xD;
expanded until the whole heavens hung over the sea like a vast&#xD;
covering of black marble over a tomb. Gloom! gloom! seemed to&#xD;
be the onlyfeeling to which the heavy atmosphere gave pulse. With&#xD;
a universal feeling of speechless awe, all on board the Isabel, save&#xD;
the captain arnd crew, turned to their berths, or the Cabin. Hastily&#xD;
the vessel wasprepared to encounter the corning storm, which soon&#xD;
broke over therm in all its fury. The sea that before had been com-&#xD;
paritively calm, now lashed into foam, and while the shrill voice of&#xD;
Boreas blew around them the hurricane gale, the high roaring waves,&#xD;
dashed over the laboring Isabel, with wrecking violence and strength,,&#xD;
filling all hearts with dismay and their trembling breasts with prayer.&#xD;
The loud, dirge-like groan of the spheres, rolled gloomily above&#xD;
them in the thunder's sullen rage, led 'on by the lurid glare of the&#xD;
lightning's incessant flashes, dancing over the turbulent waters, as&#xD;
countless death torches, but to light ahd allure them into engulphing&#xD;
destruction. For several hours the little craft darted over the waves,&#xD;
with her precious charge of human life, and rode the storm with&#xD;
something like living hope to those on board. But, ah !- luckless fate,&#xD;
hapless joy,the intoxicatingchalice, is destined soon'to be dashed from&#xD;
their lips, and.the lightning's red glare but prove their wild escort to&#xD;
the vast hidden depths of the fathomless abyss. By a sudd-en, and&#xD;
powerful lurch, the Isabel was tossed on her side and ere she could&#xD;
be righted, filled, foundered and sunk.; How shall we describe the&#xD;
fearful shrieks of that little band of human souls within her, as, they&#xD;
fel :her descending down, and down to the horrible silence of the&#xD;
deep. Amid the thuntler's.loud crash, the lightning's peireing glitter&#xD;
and the fierce wind's wild, howl,. they sank down unheard, and&#xD;
"the death-angel flapping his broad wings over the wave," shrouded:&#xD;
them in eternal sleep. But twohours later,.and by the moon's pale&#xD;
beams, two survivors of the wreck were seen floating and found:&#xD;
ering about the dark waters, seething and boiling, yet with their late&#xD;
conflict. They were Juanand Inez.. As the' Iabel went down, her&#xD;
planking broke, and some of it parting assunder, proved thank Heaven&#xD;

e&#xD;
&#xD;
a kind of raft upon which Juan and his Creole maiden were now&#xD;
floating; all save these have perished, and thus for twenty-four hours&#xD;
they foundered over the surf and foam of the angry element, that&#xD;
had swallowed in death their late company-until when about six&#xD;
hours sail from the city of New Orleans, they were picked up by&#xD;
  an outward-bound vessel, the captain of which kindly consented to&#xD;
'bout ship and land them in- the crescent city. Arrived there ahd&#xD;
 communicating the news of the wreck, and the saving of but two&#xD;
out of seventeen to tell the tale, naturally drew around them for&#xD;
several hours, quite a crowd of interested inquirers, and gaters whose&#xD;
only impi se was curiosity. On the knowledge thatthe two survivors&#xD;
had lost all, becoming known among the gathering crowd,"a'sub-&#xD;
scription was started by some philanthropic gentleman among them,&#xD;
and quite a snug sum was raised and handed over to Juan, to appro-&#xD;
priate to the necessities of himself and companion. - He received it&#xD;
with heartfelt thanks, while the fair Inez, as she stood by his side,&#xD;
could express her feelings for tile voluntary kindness, only in, many&#xD;
tears of gratitude. After this, and the captain who had picked them&#xD;
up had cause to be thankful by the reception of a handsome present&#xD;
tendered him by the same persons who acted so liberally towards&#xD;
Juan and Inez. When he left the pier again, to pursue his voyage&#xD;
out, it was amid the greatest cheering, and the many good wishes&#xD;
of those who so loudly saluted his departure. Juan andthis companion&#xD;
had nearly succeeded in making their way through the dense throng&#xD;
which had crowed around them, when he was surprised to encounter&#xD;
th 'enquiring gaze of his early friend, Sinclair Duval, they met face&#xD;
to'face, and for a moment of uncertainty which grew painful, gazed&#xD;
at each other. Juan was the first to recognize his friend, in an instant&#xD;
he rushed to embrace- him, calling him by name, he was likewise&#xD;
remembered.&#xD;
"1Why, Juan, is this indeed you or do my eyes decieve meI? It&#xD;
is, as I live, my friend Juan I"&#xD;
"1Sinclair, how oportune to meet you thus-my name was Juan&#xD;
once, but I have changed so since, .I know not that I am the same."&#xD;
"What has happened-and what means all this throng following&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
"0, Sinclair, surely Heaven has sent you to meet me ! This is&#xD;
my companion in a portion of my dangers, if you will conduct us&#xD;
to a dwelling, where I can tell you all, I shall be most happy to do&#xD;
so.. Fsay.cs, for where I am, I wish her to be also; her name is&#xD;
Inez."&#xD;
'Sinclair bowed politely to the beautiful girl, and moved towards-&#xD;
the city, accompanied by Juarrand his happy betrothed. -'The sudden&#xD;
surprise upon meeting Juan was suchon. Duvars mindthat'for'severa.&#xD;
minutes, .unable to collect himself, he;did not think of Juan but as&#xD;
an-old acquaintance or friend, the thought that since his absence, he&#xD;
had become a relative, a close relative, to him, did, not s yet enter&#xD;

entered; but Sinclair, ringing a small bell, summoned a servant, who&#xD;
soon formed his mistress, in another portion of the house, that&#xD;
his master was awaiting her presence in +the front parlor. She&#xD;
descended, and entered the room; her eye ?in an instant passed from&#xD;

controling his own feelings, he made outto stammer:&#xD;
:"Beatrice you must pardon me for this-surprise, it could not be&#xD;

for he seemed both husband and father, all in all to her. A large&#xD;
portion of their honey moon was passed in the mansion of theDuyas.&#xD;
Sinclair took an early occasion to inform- Juan of several, eents&#xD;
which occured during his long absence. They were closetedtogether&#xD;
one day for two or $hree hours.&#xD;
" Well,.Juan," said Duval as they entered and seated themselves&#xD;
iii a private apartment of his house. "What in the world did you&#xD;
do with yourself in Spain, did you enter her Majesty's serviee,or did&#xD;
the published card prove no more than what I afterwards suspected,&#xD;
a mere ruse to entrap you I  ive -me an account of your sventf!4&#xD;

death might prove to me a messenger of mercy, and rid me of a&#xD;

" Peru,---why were you there I-and in the silver mines ,-&#xD;

traficing in his body and soul, the Heavens will roll back aghast,&#xD;
and all faces will gather blackness, the mountains and the rocks fly&#xD;
from the spoiler and oppressor, crying for them to fall on him, and&#xD;
hide him from the face of the Judge. They will seek death to rid&#xD;
them of remorse, but death, by the command of the Deity, will fly&#xD;

that I escaped, and once more breathing the pure airof Heaven, felt as&#xD;
though I was but dreaming of the flowers and fields of Elysian,&#xD;
for I could scarcely realize my escape, so great was my joy. But&#xD;
by great assiduity and fatigue, I after many days found myself in&#xD;
Havana, where shipping for this place, I set sail in the ill-fated Isabel,&#xD;
made the acquaintance, of her, who, thank Heaven, I am happy in&#xD;
calling'wife,-was shipwrecked on a tempestous and dismal night,&#xD;

safe to land."&#xD;
" You have, indeed been the subject of adventure, to say the least&#xD;
of it Juan. But I need scarcely inquire your feelings towards&#xD;
Capello or Verree. Could you forgive him, or do you still retain&#xD;
your vengeance against him ?"&#xD;
"Forgive him? Sinclair 1'could, and with all my heart, for my&#xD;
mind, if not my very soul has been transformed since my departure&#xD;
from America, and did I but know where to find him I would go.&#xD;
and embrace him as my father, and hope -to obtain his forgiveness.&#xD;
Such Sinclair are my. feelings for the man, while I at the same time&#xD;
abhor and abominate slavery. To say the least of it, it is wrong,&#xD;
and unjust."&#xD;
" Capello is dead." Said Duval.&#xD;
Juan for a moment surprised, started at the sentence, and echoed-&#xD;
"Pierre VeVrce,'Capello dead ?-"&#xD;
"He is."&#xD;
"'Tis true ?-how did he die? Sinclair did you see him die? was&#xD;
ais end natural or foul-speak, I would know-"&#xD;
Sinclair, controlling his emotions at the thought of his own parent's&#xD;
iceath, brushed a tear aside and replied:&#xD;
'" He was found dead with my own father, in a reserved old build-&#xD;
ing in this city, that gave evident marks of having been struck by&#xD;
lightning on the previous night. Their bodies when discovered were&#xD;
horribly mangled by the angry fluid-"&#xD;
" Heaven pardon Verree, as I at this moment forgive him! For&#xD;
the, death, Sinclair. of your parent, I sympathize with you; but is it&#xD;
not strange they should be thus destroyed in company, were they so&#xD;
intimate ?"&#xD;
"Yes, they had grown quite intimate just before their peculiar&#xD;
fate. Father becoming engrossed in the political changes .of the&#xD;
South, particularly the Secession movement of his native State, bet&#xD;
very extravagantly, and lost a large portion of his wealth, he finaH-'&#xD;
became indebted to Capello, and hence their intimacy, which I a m&#xD;
inclined to believe added nothing to his life or his reputation."&#xD;

his heart the thin blood slowly oozes and trickles to his feet; while&#xD;
he yet shivers with weakness and the consequences of crime, 'several&#xD;
others of similar appearance and' character join him at the base of&#xD;
the tower, and withoutopening their lips, with a slight incliiatio of&#xD;

morn, ' clear as the sup, fair as the moon, and terrible as armyy&#xD;
with banners.' A rainbow offtranslucent. dyes, encircles her brow,&#xD;
while from her polishedfeeti-sheeting thedry desert plain in a spacious&#xD;
sea, issued forth streams and cdashes of liquid light. Calmly she&#xD;
rests above th'oifensive cavern on a strong anchor of massive gold.&#xD;
Her luxuriant auburn ringlets flow bank from her fair open brow&#xD;
in unbouud tresses, extending over the, white satin boddice of her&#xD;
dress, the flowing slkirl.f' which trimmed in gold droops to her satin&#xD;
incased feet in heavy folds. On her head rests a rich velvet cap,&#xD;
spangled with diamonds and silver, while, one hand points majestic.&#xD;
call to Heaven, with the-other she clasps a golden sceptre, with,&#xD;
which,she points in Pmiles to a milk white scroll swinging in&#xD;
triumph from one arm of. the Anchor, and bearing ..letters of gold,&#xD;
'atuE, LIBERTY IANDIDEPENC.' With the eale's flightshe&#xD;
descends to the eatA, and pressing a seal on the unsightly chasm,&#xD;
closes it, and it so. remains forever. The plain now, which was&#xD;
desolateand dreary, becomelike the garden of E den, and the whole&#xD;
world repeopled with the unnuimbered millions of a new born raee,&#xD;
rejoices and blooms as the rose. Whore the wilderness once stood,&#xD;
life and health diffusing waters break out, an4 streams of holy nectar&#xD;
gush forth from the .desert. The slave-parched ground becomes a&#xD;
pool and the tear and blood, saturated land,-springs living water,&#xD;
instead of the thorn, lo, the nrtle tree, o( peace springs up, and&#xD;
instead of the death-brigr, the r-tree of heahhthe box and the pin.&#xD;
together. And'lo, new mountain start forth, and lifting their lofty&#xD;
peaks to Heaven, they (rop back into the rosy lap of the earth&#xD;
now freeided ,the yswet wine of friendship harmony and love.&#xD;

niild reign.  Yes Litef antruth, unristiflied with error or the&#xD;
fear of nn, wiL edmacipate the world from misery and woe.' I-is&#xD;
then we may sing consistently-' Hail Columbia. happy land.' But&#xD;
until the curse of African slavery is removed,.the woe pronounced&#xD;
against the 'land shadowing within wings,' consumes the beauty ad&#xD;
,uengt of the fairest portions of our common country. fla.ste tho&#xD;
