"If what shone afar so grand, Turn to nothing in thy hand, On again ;-the virtue lies In the struggle -not the prize." HOW beautiful are the dreams of childhood In  after life, they will recur to our minds, in all their brilliancy and beauty. The phanton voice of Hope may have fled ; but still they will return to us. An Artist slept, and dreamed. Bright were his visions. To rise by his own exertions; to appear before the world a self-made artist, was his aim of life. At the commence* : ment of his career, little did he think of the obstacles that were to obstruct his path; the fears, the doubts, that were to take possession of his mind. Ambition urged , him onward; and Hope, with her winning smite, sus- tained him during the contest. Sorrow, andher attend-   ants, came. Sometimes despair -almost reigned in his heart; but still he wearied not.  Europe appeared to him, in his dream. England  proudly displayed the author of Hamlet and Othello, th6e  very Queen, the "little -gems" of I'Allegro, and ll Pen-  seroso, and the Arcadia.   &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8157-00000003"/> 10t       THE ARTIST'S DREAM. And Wordsworth, too, Nature's own true and perfect artist, shed his radiance over the intellectual world. Burns, and Scott, stood pre-eminent in the literature of Scotland. From Britain's rocky shores, his thoughts wandered to Italy, the land of beauty, and of love. There the musician flies, and listens -with ecstasy to the soul- inspiring strains of Durente and Pergolesi. There, the architect finds inspiration; and there, the Artist is taught to unfold his talents. Italy, beautiful Italy! In no other country does the sun shine with such brilliancy. The arches and columns of Rome andNaples glitter in its rays. The silver fountains cool the summer air, and diffuse their brilliant spray upon the blooming flowers. The bright waters of her noble rivers flow joy- fully; and'night zephyrs wander in the olive groyes. No other land abounds in such varied charms of nature, and of art. The European and American, when they find themselves basking in this sunny clime, are transported with its beauties; and even the wild African gazes, in childlike simplicity, upon the productions of art, and wonders what new objects will next meet his eye. The superiority of her artists is as indisputable, as that of her external beauties. Who has heard of the gifted Rapheel without a thrill of pleasure-of Palladio, or of Micheel Angelo? They have rendered themselves im- mortal by the exercise of their talents ; and their works will ever remain among the noblest monuments of gen- ius . The young artist sighed, as he thought of these bright   THE ARTIST'S DREAM. S         S., -stars, and longed to shine with half their splendor. He  resolved to exert every power to attain so desirable an  object, and it will be seen in the following pages how it success crowned his efforts. He possessed a fine mind, and what is bf much more importance, a heart sanctified by the teachings of the Holy Spirit.

His mother, the lovely Cathaxine St. Clair, was the daughter of a princely New York merchant. Just after her marriage she went to reside at the homestead of the Lee family, situated in one of the fairest and most fertile portions of the "Old Donilioren." She found her life there novel, but very pleasant. Her lines seemed, truly, to have been castin pleasant places-the only obstacle to her happi- hess being the frequent absence of her husband on his oye. i-e was ordered off on a three years' cruise, when Arthur was but ten years of age. That fond pakt- -ing was the last. He was soon afterward lost at sea; leaving a little girl who had seen but one summer. It was a heavy stroke indeed; but the widowed mother bowed in meek submission, knowing it was a loving Father's hand which dealt it. Her brother, Edward St. Clair, (now the guardian of her children,) wished her to take up her residence in New, York, but she preferred remaining in a home en- deared to her by countless associationls, and where her   THE ARTIST'S DREAAM.        1 little ones would be free from many of the temptations of the metropolis. Henceforth, all her energies  were devoted to them.' She wished to bring the'e up in the ways of holiness; and earnestly prayed that strength might be given her for the work. For several years she was their constant companion, guide, and friend. It then pleased God to lay His af- flicting hand once more upon her. Sickness came, and she felt that her darlings would soon be made orphans, and her home desolate. Once, while weeping over her daughter, the little Ma-- rion, Arthur said, "Do not cry, dear mamma, I will take care of my little sister." With a bursting heart, she replied, "You are very young, Arthur, but you can help to teach her what is right.' Remember   your dying mother's words, to love her, and shield her from unkindness.  My precious chil- dren, how can I leave you!" But the struggle was soon over. Jesus, in whom she had so long trusted, gave her -comfort, and she cheerfully committed them to His care, with the hope, that when they were done with temporal things they would be re-    v united to her, in a land where all is joy and peace. "There are no scattered homes in that far land, No riven friends, no agony, no pain,  No broken hearts nor treacherous fortune there, No darksome graves where life-long love is lain, No trial, no temptation, and no sin; The ransomed race of men, to angels are ackin,"  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8157-00000005"/> "       THE ARTIST'S DREAM.

I cannot bear a black Act dress, and besides, it is so unbecoming to my complexion!" ' Certainly not, Maria, if your feelings do not prompt you to do so ; but I trust a sense of propriety will pre- -Tent you from going to large entertainments." "Surely, Edward, that is too much to require of me. I should die of ennui, if I had to give up parties. Mrs. La Costa's ball is to come off next week, and it will be a very brilliant one. My dress arrived yesterday from Paris, and is so elegant! When will your nephew and niece be here? I wish they were older. Children are always so troublesome." , Arthur is old enough to take care of himself, and Marion, I think, will not be much trouble to you," coldly replied her husband; for he thought of his 'own little daughter Lilia, whose delicate health he attributed more to material neglect than to any other cause. Edward St. Clair had married a beautiful woman, but she was cold, haughty, and selfish, and he was now reap- ing the fruits of his folly.   TH E ARTIST'S DREAM.   .   15 - He had met with a disappointment in early life, and like many other men, recklessly rushed into- marriage, finding, when too late, that there was no affinity of either heart or mind. While he endeavored to forget domestic trials in his office in Wall Street, his wife was devoting her time to fashion and display. She wore fashionable apparel, visited fashionable  people, and attended a fash- ionable church. It was on a chilly evening in November, when a travel- ling carriage drew up at No. 60 Place. Mr. St. Clar  was in the hall ready to receive his young relatives, lnd make them welcome to his heart and home. Poor things I how they yearned for their mother, when they met the cold looks of Mrs. St. Clair! That lady rarely noticed them, though she remarked to her husband that Arthur was a fine youth, and Marion would make a great sensa- tion in the world some day. She only wished Lilia was as pretty. The two little girls soon became good friends, and en- joyed themselves in their own way. They often walked   :- with nurse Weston, and purchased toys and bonbons at   -; the gay shops' on Broadway. Arthur was pursuing his studies at Columbia College; but he spent a little while each day in the nursery, with  A his sister and cousin, telling them Bible stories, and pa- tiently replying to their childish questions.  Sometimes he brought his portfolio and showed them his sketches. With eager pleasure they looked at some  AN - . -1,  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8157-00000006"/> 16       THE ARTIST'S DREAM. familiar scene on Staten Island, or at the magnificent scenery of the Highlands. "Why do you always make pictures from the country?" said Lilia; "I think the town is just as good." "Because, God made the country, and His works are al- ways beautiful, and it teaches me to look from ' nature up to nature's God.'"He hoped, he said, to be an artist. some day; and then he would paint their portraits sitting side by side. His cousin's sunny locks and pensive face would contrast prettily, he thought, with Marion's dark hair and becoming eyes.            ,  t   THE ARTIST'S DREAM.           17 CHAP PTE1 IV.

Tlilia led  him to  her bird-cage. "Poor   Pero," said Arthur, looking in, "when did he die?"     "I don't know.  When   I brought him  his breakfast, instead  of hopping about and   chirping as he usually did, I found him dead  "  And she   burst into a  fresh flood of tears. Arthur sat down on   the sofa, and took Tlilia on his knee, saying,  "Don't grieve so much about your bird; I willgive yon another."                         -  "But that won't be     like having Pero.

I don't think I would care so much if I were certain that I should meet him in heaven. Do you think I will, Cousin Arthur?" "No." "Why not? Pero was a good little bird, and I will try to be a good girl." "Pero's good conduct will not take him to heaven, be- cause he had no soul.-: Birds and beasts have not the faculties with which we are endowed. God has made us but little lower than the angel, and our souls will live forever and ever."    , Here the conversation was /interrupted by Marion run- ing into the room and exclaiming, "aLilia, I have just heard that Pero is dead. I'll bet anything, that horrid Mrs. Jenkins killed him!" 'How?" said TAlia. "Don't you-remember she was here yesterday and put her eyes close to the bars of the cage, squinting all the time?  Pero was so frightened that he almost fell from his perch, and I don't expect he ever recovered from the shock. If she were to lose her glasses, I won- der if she would go peering about as she does now. If it were not for making so many blunders, and looking so ridiculous, I should like to be near-sighted myself-it's so fashionable." "I don't think-I shall ever like Mrs. Jenkins anymore," said ULilia. "Marion -has been talking nonsense," said Arthur. "Mrs. Jenkins has had nothing to do with Pero's death, r  E    THE ARTIST'S DREAM.   .   - and no doubt thought she was pleasing you by noticing him at all. Monlking-birds are very tender, and gen- erally die suddenly. You will miss your little pet, I know.  He was a sweet songster." "I like mocking-birds better than. canaries; don't you, Cousin Arthur?" "Yes, their plumage is not so pretty: but they are more graceful, and are much more easily tamed." Tilia thought that she would like to have Pero buried; so she and Marion held a long consultation on the sub- ject. They finally agreed to empty one of Dolly's boxes, and put Pero into it, wrapped into a winding sheet, in imitation of some of the ancient kings. Then, with measured steps, they bore him from the house, and de- posited him with much ceremony in a little grave. A wooden head-piece was raised to his memory, on which was written the simple words, "Our Pero." Poor Pero! He had been accustomed to sing and bask in the sun- shine of the nursery window.  Now he lay in the cold   - shadow of a corner of the little yard.  i   i         '! ' * '          ,' '  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8157-00000008"/> 20        THE ARTIST'S DREAM. CToAPElce V.

I think ladieswho wear such immense skirts, ought to be charged extra. Don't you?"

"She .spread her hoops over my pink lawn dress, until, it looked like an old rag. I looked daggers at her, but she didn't care for that." The children's attention was now attracted by the pit- eous tones of a little girl on the walk, saying,, "All's gone." The pitcher which she had been carryingwas accidentally knocked over by a man who was hurrying   ? past her, and she stood, looking in dismay at the scat-  ; tered fragments. "Yes, the milk is all gone, poor little girl!" exclaimed , ' "  Marion.              -      ."

A look of surprise and pleasure passed over her face, as she picked them up, and with an awkward attempt at a courtesy, she moved on. "I wonder if she has a mother," said Lilia, "and what she will say about the spilled milk?" "I expect she will punish her," replied Marion; "I fancy I see the old witch shaking her now." "Oh I Marion, you have not done your drawing-and Cousin Arthur is to be here after luncheon, to give us a lesson." "Sure enough. I forgot all about it. I will get at it now." She produced an unfinished sketch, opened her' box of pencils, and set to work vigorously. But she soon stopped, and with a despairing look, said: "I'1l never get this boy's arm right. Can5t you help me, Lilia?" "Why no," replied Lilia. "You know a great deal more about drawing than I do. The 'chimneys of my houses are always tumbling down, and my cow's horns never do turn the right way." Marion seemed to be in deep meditation, for a few min- utes, and then exclaimed, "I know what I'll do. I'll ask Dr. F  to help me. He is in the library talking to Aunt Maria." Suiting the action to her words, she sprang from her seat, and was just opening the door, when a hand was laid upon her shoulder, and Weston said:  "Oh! don't, Miss Marion, it wouldn't be at all proper. What would my lady say?" she added, as Marion shook   TIlE ARTIST'S DRPA A.       23 off her hand, "and besides, the doctor couldn't help "Yes, but he could, though; for Sallie Mason told me that her brother got his arm broken, and that Dr. F-- fixed it, so that it was as good as ever." "Oh! but that was a different thing," replied the ser- ant. "When gentlemen break their bones, doctors set 'em; but you see there's nothing of that kind to be done, in this case." Arthur entered the room in the midst of the discussion, and was greeted. by Marion with "Oh, Arthur, my pic- ture isn't done. I put the little boy in the tree, to gath- er acorns; but of course he couldn't do anything with a bad arm." "And who gave him a bad arm?" was the smiling query.  'Why, I did," replied Marion, looking rather morti- fied.  "I don't see any acorns to be gathered," said her   ^ brother, taking up the sketch.            -  ; "I haven't made them yet. Acorns are such ugly-  things. I can see beauty in apples and peaches, and in iJ the sunpnd moon-and there is something grand in a    v  thunder-storm, and in the waves of the ocean, as they  - dash along; but, there is no beauty in an acorn."    i "There is beauty in the apple, and the peach," said Arthur.

There is a fear- ful beauty in the dashing wave, and the roaring billow- and there is beauty, too, in a simple, neglected acorn.  Look!" he continued, taking one from his pocket, " how admirably it shows the wisdom of God, in the perfection of its organization. Thus, you see, that even an acorn is an instance of the goodness of that Being, who makes everything for some wise purpose." "Is it true," asked Marion, " that the big oak springs from a little acorn?" Yes, and did you know, that the Charter of Connecticut was concealed in an oak?" "I did not know before that the oak could be of any use."  "'The Spartans," said Arthur, "constructed their couches on which they reclined when at meals of the wood of this tree, and ornaments were sculptured on it. Now, we will see what can be done with the little boy's refractory arm." "You will draw it for me, won't you Arthur?" "No, my dear little sister. That would not be right, and would do you no good. Take your pencil, and try your best." Marion made a few strokes, and then used her India rubber. But Arthur was very patient; and after some directions from him, and many blunders on her part, the arm was properly shaped. . "Are you not glad that you drew it yourself?" he asked.

I thought, perhaps, it was a picture with the   sun shining on it."  "An approving conscience is a sun-picture," replied her brother. "The hope of hereafter dwelling in the presence of God, and the angels; the cherished wish of meeting the loved and lost, in that bright and beautiful land: above all, to be one of the chosen band of Him, who ruleth over all; are sunbeams, which illumine some people's existence. Glorious pictures they are; which animate them to deeds of love and mercy." 2 1* t . * .  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8157-00000011"/> 26       THE ARTIST'S DREAM. CHAPPTER VI.

WHEN the children became older, Mr. St. Clair wished to place them under the care of a com- petent governess.

She was young, pretty, and engaging, all great faults in Mrs. St. Clair's eyes. According to her ideas, a gov- erness should always be old and ugly. This one, she "supposed, would plume herself on her doll-baby face, and flaxen ringlets; and put on numberless airs. Her name too, (Maud Vincent,) how romantic! and she laughed sarcastically.

On her way to Dunbarton, her troops were attacked by those of her brother, the Earl of Murray, and totally routed. It is said that the Queen stood on an eminence, and watched the progress of the battle. She passed into England, and sought the protection of her cousin, Queen Elizabeth. The latter held out promises of friendship; but congrat- ulated herself upon having so formidable a rival in her power. She was crafty, and designing. Her vanity was unbounded; and she had always been jealous of the superiority of the Queen of Scots. She kept her in cap-- - tinity for eighteen years, and treated her with great se- verity.

"Now the storm is over;-- Oh let freemen be our sons; And letfuture Washin gtons Rise to lead their valiant ones, Till there's war no more." GENERAL WASHINGTON was the first President of the United States, was he not?" asked Ma- rion, the morning after the conversation recorded in the last chapter. "How glad he must have been!" "His feelings were probably of a mixed character, for he loved domestic life, and only left it at the urgent call of a grateful people. The country he had so long and so faithfully served, was involed in new difficulties. The treaty of peace with Great Britain had* not been amicably settled. Spain declined to negotiate with the United States; and even refused the navigation of the Mississippi to the Indians, who were on friendly terms with her. Even France showed signs of disaffection.   She thought that the part she had taken in the struggle for independence, entitled her to meddle in our internal af- fairs. General Washington's great judgment and pru- dence, however, overcame all these difficulties. He was one of Nature's rioblemen. When some of his advisers ,  . ^- '                  - i!* i    Goof, t; X -i THE ARTIST'S DREAM  .51 thought pomp and state essential to the dignity of his  - a office, he only wished for republican simplicity.

"When did he die?"  "On the night of the 14th of December, 1799, at     j Mount Vernon,- the home he loved so well. He had the blessed hope of the Christian to sustain him in his last hours. Darlkess was as light to him, and he  passed through the valley of shadows without a fear. You should read the life of Napoleon, in connection with that of Washington. The former/was a dazling meteor;  the-latter, the majestic sun."      - "I should think, if he was as great as the sun,)' said Iilia, innocently, "that Cousin Arthur ought to have named his beautiful terrier for him, instead of Brutus.

"He entered into a conspiracy with Cassius; who had also been one of Pompey's generals, and who had re- ceived his life at Coesar's hands. Many others were as- sociated in the plot. A meeting of the Senate had been appointed for the 15th of March; and it was decided to commit the fatal deed on that day." "I wonder he did not find it out in some way." "He had been advised to be on his guard, on the 15th, and at the urgent request of his wife (who, it seems, had a presentiment of evil,) he remained in his palace a part of that day. Then several of the conspirators called on him, and stated that public business required his pres- ence at the Curia. On his way thither, a letter was handed him, containing news of his approaching danger; but unfortunately, he did not open it. When he reached the Senate Chamber, he was received with the usual marks of respect; and when he was seated in the chair of state, (which was not far from the statue of Pompey the Great,) one of the conspirators, Tillius Cimber, feigned to approach him as a suppliant, and took hold of his toga. Then the attack began. Casca gave him the first blow with his sword, and the others wounded him in the face, loins and neck. He had sprung from his seat, and for awhile defended himself with vigor; but when Brutus struck him, he looked at him reproachfully, and said: "And you, too, Brutus I'" "Why did he love Brutus so much?" * I K   THE ARTIST'S DREAM.        5 3 "It is said, that in early life, he was the devoted ad- mirer of Brutus's mother.

It is a pity that Cato's proposi- tion to deliver him into the hands of the barbarians, was not carried into effect. It would have been a meet pun- ishment for such base treachery. He professed great friendship for Pompey, and yet constantly devised means to injure him." "Pompey acted towards him in like manner." "That's no excuse for Cmesar. "But he was very much affected, when he heard of Pompey's unhappy fate." It was well for himn, I suppose, to affect a few croco- dile tears; when the head and ring of his most formi- dable rival were presented to him; and he knew he was powerless to harm him. It was only another instance of his duplicity." "And it would be well for you, my dear, to do justice to everybody," remarked ]Miss Vincent. "Caesar and Pompey were great rivals, and each sought to crush the other; but it is natural that death should destroy all bit- ter feelings, even in the hardest heart." "But it seems to me, it would be better for people to treat each other with more kindness in life; and then in death there would not be so much regret." "A sage reniiark; but. one, unfortunately, which is not followed by the world." "Were not Pompey and Csesar related to each other?"

"It would probably have done so, but for their over- weening ambition. They both desired the first place in the empire; and neither would give precedence to the other. Did you know that one of our summer months was called after Caesar?" "Which one?" "Can you not tell?" "June,--Ju-oh, it was July," said Marion. "How odd, to call any month in the year after a man!" "Caesar was born in the month of Quintilis, which was afterwards changed to Julius (after him,) hence, the ori- gin of the word, July." "Just to think," cried Marion, indignantly, "of Caesar being called' The Father of his Countryr!' I did not know that any one, but Washington, deserved that title." "Caesar was not the -'Father of his Country,' in the same case as ashington; but he was sincere and ear,-  nest in his efforts to improve Italy.

"A ghost," exclaimed Lilia, drawing herself to her full height; "'I did not know there was a sure enough one, in the world, although, I often heard so, when I was a little girl. "And pray, what are you now?" said Miss Vincent, much amused.  "There is really no such thing as a ghost. Brutus was unhappy and disheartened, at the events of the war; and his phantom was merely the creation of a disordered fancy." "Was Cassius killed in battle?" "No. A far more terrible death awaited him.

Joan was among the foremost ranks. Bravely she wielded the bloody spear. The groans of the wounded and dving were heard on every side. Soon, the French banner was seen waving in the distance; and the English, who had dreamed of glory and conquest, fled. Quickly, the French pursued; but were recalled, by the voice of Joan, urgng them to pay the last sad rites to their respected dead. Her great object was ac- complished. "In the cathedral at Rheims was a large and majestic assembly. The mystic oil was brought. Charles bowed himself before it; and the ceremony of his Coronation was performed with great pomp and splendor. "Acclamations greeted the ear of Joan; and she was styled the deliverer of her country.' But how little- did she know the fate that awaited her! Joan, once the pride of France, was accused of witchcraft, and burned at Rouen. Of what advantage was her fnme now? and did not her thoughts revert to her childhood's home? Did not her father's cottage, with its beautiful flowers, and clustering vines, come before her; and did she not wish, that instead of moving in warlike scenes, she had been contented to remain within the precincts of- her humble dwelling? .

She would have taken her immediately to her mother, but Lilia begged to remain in the school-room, saying, in a meek tone, that she never felt very well. Her illness did not signify, and would soon pass off. She had selected Laura as the subject of her composi- tion.

Her beauty, wit and reputed wealth made her an admired belle, wherever she went.    The soft voice of flattery fell on her ear, and life, to her inexperienced eyes, was filled with sunshine and with flowers. Arthur trembled when he thought of what might be the effect of all this, on one of her temperament.   He knew it was not the path which led to true happiness; and   THE ARTIST'S DREAM.        67  that she was not kept " unspotted from the world," as his mother would have wished. He had long ago been admitted to the bar, and was an eloquent pleader, though his heart was not in his profession. A small room ad- joining his chamber, had been fitted up as a studio; End , there he might often be seen busily engaged on the por- trait of his sister, whom he had induced to give him an hour every day. She became very weary of the sittings, and sometimes laughingly threatened to run away. The i tedium was partially relieved, however, by pleasant dis-/ course-the artist endeavoring, the while, to catch the happiest expression of that ever-varying countenance. One moment it would be radiant with joy-then, sad. and pensive, as she thought of the companion of her childhood, who, had she lived, would have been with her at this time.            ' Dear, gentle Lilia! Her picture was engraved on the leaves of memory. The hours spent in the various galleries of Art, were sources of exquisite enjoyment to Marion. With a nat- ural love of the beautiful, her taste had been greatly improved by her brother. At the     Gallery, she was attracted by a picture which hung near the entrance. It was one of exquisite beauty. The light and shade were admirably blended, and the subject awakened golden memories in her mind.

And with an unthrift love, did run from Venice, Ai far as Belmont." By the side of this painting was one, perhaps of equal value as a work of art; but of a different character.

I be- lieve artists are the only people who don't dress up their children; and indeed I should think it would be very nice to get rid of having one's 'clothes put on every day. Baby would like it." And at-the mention of the house- hold pet, her eyes grew brighter, and her countenance more animated. "Yes, baby would like it very much I know. She is always sweet and good until dressing-time comes. She kicks and squeals when nurse is putting on her little shoes; and bobs her head in all directions when her hair is being brushed. Sometimes she screws this way, and that way, and all sorts of ways; and curls herself up until it is hard to straighten her out. She is the fun- niest little baby in the world; and makes so many wry faces, when her pretty little white frock is being put on But when it is all done, and she is let alone, she laughs and crows, and is so glad."' Marion was much divased at the picture of domestic life, .thus unexpectedly presented to her; and she thought how shocked the sculptor would be at the idea of having his little winged god attired in stiff pantaloons and coat. She was reminded of a story she once heard of a lady, who, on seeing Powers's "Greek Slave," rushed from the room, exclaiming: C"She isn't ready; I'll wait until she is dressed!" Marion went to the other end of the gallery, and was examining a landscape, when she was joined by her friend, Mr. Hartwell, an artist of-considerable merit.

"ItI is such a sunny one, -if I may be allowed the expression." "Yes; the coloring is rich, warm, and harmonious; and the perspective is admirable."  "How beautiful those children" are on the beach, par- ticularly the one nearest the water. He looks almost like a seraph." "They have. been- gathering shells, and are grouped in a most picturesque manner. The head of your little. seraph is a study in itself-and see! the sunlight is play- ing in his hair, until it seems to be turned into a sheet of burnished gold. His fine eyes are dilated, and his lips slightly parted, as he listens to the Siren's song."

"Impossible!" cried Marion laughing; "I should suppose they could have been cdone in as many hours, How unromtantic to tlinlr of seraphs having toes!" "They have them, though, as well as common mortal ; and we artists have to paint them. How much time do0 you think it would require to give .a graceful curve to your neck; to do justice to the contour of your face; or  "To paint' the dimples in my cheeks," interrnpted Marion. "A lifetime, of course. But jesting aside, I had never considered how much more might be acco- plished by some artists than by others, in the same space of time. I should have said this landscape was finished with easy grace." "Some artists possess the faculty of concealing an im- mense amount of labor, under an apparently light execu- tion. Leonardo da Vinci was sixteen years in painting "The Last Supper."  Titian worked for eight years, I believe, on his "Pietro Martire."

" am sorry to bet obliged to answer you in the nega- tive. I know there is a difference, and yet I cannot explain in what it consists. I only feel the beauty of a picture; I do not understand it." "You should study Art more closely. It is a double pleasure to both feel and understand its beauty. Com-" pare, for instance, the masters of the Flemish and Italian Schoqls. The Flemish are, perhaps, more true to na- ture. They paint more from life as it really is-in its common-place, every-day aspect; and the physical beauty of many of their pictures is unrivalled. The Italians aspire to something higher. They endeavor to delineate, the emotions of the mind.. With them, the physical is lost in the intellectual. Do I weary you?" he said, abruptly. "Not at all. I am very glad to gain all the informa- tion I dan," and he, pleased with having so interested a listener, discotrsed long and eloquently on the varied beauties of his art. "By Jove! What a magnificent creature! How well she carries her height!" Arthur looked up from the bust he was sketching, and recognized Monsieur Delarne, who had recently arrived in New York, and to whom he had been introduced a few days before, at the house of a friend. He was scrutinizing Marion, but soon turned to Arthur, saying: "Can you tell me who she is? She is the most stylish- looking person I have seen on this Continent; and alto- gether the best dressed."

The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders, and remarked that the art of the toilette was better understood in his own country. "I suspect," he added, "that the lady, with all her beauty, and grace, prides herself on the little knowledge she has acquired. She probably hopes to win the favor of the artist, by rivalling him in his own profession-a mistake which can be readily pardoned in youth." "I imagine she has no such aspirations," replied Ar- thur, quietly.  "Are you acquainted with her?" asked Monsieur Delarne, becoming rather nervous. "Slightly, as she is my sister;" andi closing his sketch- ;I book, he joined Marion, who was just passing them, on her way to the carriage.

Eleanor Marshall stood before him with the peti- tion in her hand, and in a speaking attitude. She wore a coarse black dress, and a white cap on her head. Mr. Forester and Captain Ryland, in black gowns andclhats, were Judge Twisdon, and Judge Chester. The characters in the background were distributed among a few gen- tlemen friends.

The last tableau was the most beautiful. Twelve young girls, lovely in .their freshness and innocence, represented "The Brides of Venice." They were attired in robes of spotless white, and their long veils were fastened to their hair by wreaths of orange blossoms. Mrs. St. Clair was desirous of going to Cuba for a short time, and from thence to New Orleans. Her husband's business arrangements would prevent his leaving New York, but that he said need not interfere with her plans, as Arthur and Marion would accompany her. Eleanor and Augusta, Mr. Seymour- and Captain Ryland, afterward joined the party, and a gay winter was anticipated. The vessel on which they sailed was crowded with passengers. Some were going to Cuba for pleasure. Some in the hope of regaining their "losta blessing," health, or at least prolonging life amid the soft breezes of the tropics. When the steamer entered the fineharbor of Havana, even the consumptives with hec- tic cheeks and languid steps appeared on deck to enjoy the scene. It was one of surpassing loveliness.

Marion was as beautiful as a houri. Eleanor looked very lovely in her flowing dress of India muslin, with her soft auburn hair waving on her pure brow. Her neck and arms were without ornament, causing Captain Ryland to mutter something about " beauty un- adorned." Augusta could never be handsome with her little grey eyes and. turned-up nose, but her form was good and her movements graceful. She was one'bf those persons who make considerable show on a small capital, and having always on hand a stock of "small talk," which readily passes current in society. The Tacon Theatre was perfect in its arrangements, and brilliantly lighted. Percy took a hasty survey of the gay assemblage, and then devoted himself to Eleanor, who sat beside him. In low faltering tones, he spoke on a subject she would rather not have listened to just then, and most earnestly did he plead his cause. I looked into thy gentle eyes, And sought to penetrate their depths. I listened to the Sweet music of thy voice, 'and wondered why my heart Did flutter so.

In the awk- ward silence that followed, Eleanor took from   her bouquet a white rose, lovely in its spotless purity, and \x1-  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8157-00000038"/> 80       THE ABTIST' DREAM. gave it to him. His -handsome face beamed with pleas- ure as he received it. The curtain rose. Steffanone sang divinely; but one at least, in that crowded house, listened not. A still sweeter' voice was singing to him; and-fancy was weav- ing a golden web for the future. The week spent at Matanzas was delightfulindeed, especially to Arthur, who looked at everything with an artist's eye. The country seemed like an earthly Para- dise; and he was often tempted to exclaim, "This region surely is not of earth Was it not dropt from heaven?" The days were brilliant with the sunlight, and the nights were illumined by the bright eyes of the cucuyos. Soon after their return to Havana, they drove to la Plaza de Armas. The band played delightfully, and the scene was very inspiriting. The Cuban ladies reclined grace- fully in their volante, and gently waved their jeweled fans. The next morning they were surprised to find the air cool and damp, and the wind roaring. The norther lasted but a short time, however: for when they took passage for New Orleans a day or two afterward, the fair Queen of the Antilles" was smiling im the brilliant sun- light.

Ealy in the evening, Chartres, Canal, and other streets were lined with spectators awaiting the movements of th "Mistick Krewe of Comus."  The procession appeared about nine o'clock, with lights on both sides. A -large semi-circular transparency was held aloft, hung withbhi- nese lanterns, and bearing the name of the "KC rewe?' The subjects of the exposition was " The Four Ages of Life."

Manhood, with its vices and its follies; and lastly Age, a with its contending passions land its struggles between virtue, and depravity. The "grim visaged monster," Death, terminated all; and was represented by a slowly moving figure wrapped in a winding sheet. The procession arrived at the Varieties Theatre, which was soon densely thronged. The dress-circle presented a brilliant display of Southern beauty and fashion. At the conclusion of the tableau, which was gotten up with the usual taste and munificence of that secret so- ciety-the - Krewe-the ball opened. The maskers entered with imuch apparent enjoyment in the dance, but at twelve o'clock they disappeared as' suddenly and mysteriously as did Cinderella from the Princes' ball. The guests remained, however, until a very late hour. It was nearly dawn when Mrs. St. Clair and her friends left the theatre. It was-the first celebration of Mardi Gras they had ever witnessed; and they were charmed with the novelty and brilliancy of the entertainment. A few days afterwards they received cards to a masquerade, which Mrs. St. Clair insisted upon their' accepting, as they would not have an opportunity of attending another. Augusta and the Captain maintained, that as they were neither Catholics nor Episcopalians, there could be no impropriety in participating in amusements during the season of Lent. The ball was given at   Hotel, whither Mrs. St. Clair proceeded, as "Queen of Night," dressed in black velvet, studded with silver stars.

Augusta and Arthur, as Venus and Mercury,-were beside her when they entered the ball-room, and were mistaken by the "Iron Duke" to be attendant constella- tions. He raised his telescope, and examined them with evident interest. Venus was of course expected to van- ish at an early hour. Instead, she complained of the" heat, and made a movement to unmask.- Talleyrand pressed eagerly forward, expecting to see a face as beauti- ful as the goddess wore when she rose from the froth of the sea, and his look of disappointment was ludicrous to behold. All nations seemed to be represented. Even a wild Indian was seen in fantastic costume, brandishing a tomahawk.- "Fair goddess, aim not thy arrows at my heart," said a gentleman in a black doming, approaching Eleanor. She passed on, but was soon accosted by the same per- son, "Though I bend the' knee at thy shrine, O Diana of Ephesus, I know thou wouldst be more in thy duty at- tending thy gouty husband, than minhng in the revels of the masquerade." Eleanor accepted Percy's invitation to dance the next quadrille, and found, to her dismay, that her persecutor would be vis-a-vis, "She is wrongly named. She should be called Juliet, and her partner Romeo," said a voice near them, to the great annoyance of Eleanor, and the amusement of Percy.

Ryland) moving away, which was sufficient explanation. Eleanor became in some way separated from her friends, and  3he wandered hither and thither, in the hope of meeting some one she knew. Once she saw Arthur, but before ghe could reach him he had disappeared in the crowd.  Co add to her distress, she was followed by her tormentor x in the black domimo.  It was very late, and Mrs. St. Clair wished to return   ; home. It was agreed that Arthur and Percy should go  n search of Eleanor, while Mrs. St. Clair, Marion, and   X3 Augusta should be accompanied to their hotel by Capt.  Ryland. As he conducted them out of the hotel a voice  hissed in his ear,    .       . "Of all gods that tread the spangled skies,  Thou most unjust,--most hateful in our eyes."  "A pleasant reminder of my godlike character," said    ^ he Captain, good humoredly.  Percy found Eleanor near one of the entrances, and he  ed her immediately to a carriage. She unmasked, and  ppeared pale and -agitated.  "You are weary. Rest here, beloved," said Percy,  Irawing her gently towards him. "Why, you are like  i, frightened dove. Do rnot tremble so!" . She soon became composed, and looked, indeed, like a white dove, restliig in his bosom, safe in its peaceful  iaven. When they reached the St. Charles, they found  lCre.

Mr. De Vere was a near rela-  . tive of Mrs. St. Clair,-a Creole of great wealth, and of the most refined and cultivated tastes. He had been travel-  ling with his wife in Europe for some years, and they had only returned the previous autumn. Their elegant   residence in the city remained closed, and Ravenswood had been prepared for their reception. The house was - built in true Southern style, with piazzas on every side-  the front commanding an extensive view of the Mismsss-   ' sippi River. Steamboats, and numbers of small craft were passing up and domwn, almost every hour, and pre-p  ; ' seated quite an animated scene. On each side of the  avenue were clusters of large trees. The cypress, the   pine, and the live oak, -anll beautiful, grand and magnifi- cent,-fit abodes for sylvan deities. There were many such at Ravenswood, and Mr. De Vere took great pride' in them.

You think earu will plant, perhaps- plant for the benefit of posterity. That is a serious thought! Ah, these old trees often make one reflect very seriously. 'The grounds at Ravenswood were laid out with taste and elegance, and were surrounded by hedges of arbor vitse, laurestine, roses, and oranges. In the centre was a large fountain. The water gushed from an exquisite marble  urn, covering   the  sea-nymphs which   sup- ported it with a transparent veil. Gold and- silver fish were in the basin, anid sparkling in the sunshine. There were cool grottoes, and arbors, glowing with lovely little lady bank roses, and the blossoms of the yellow jessa- mine. Beautiful magnolias were in bloom, looking "Like a flock of white doves peeping From their hermitage of green." Large banks of roses, of almost every hue, scented the air with their fragrance. Japonicas, fuchsias, oleanders, crape myrtles, and flowering shrubs grew in perfection, and smiled, as if in proud consciousness of their omn beauty.

Mr. and Mrs. De Vere sat in the library with their guests, after their arrival, talking over the masquerade. "When our party entered the ball-room," said Arthur, "I heard an Egyptian exclaim    'What a heathenish set! which struck me as, very ridiculous, considering the source from whence it came!" "The speeches made to thee, fair goddess,"said   . De Vere, turning to Eleanor, "were intended Tor the ' Queen of the Fairies.' It was her original intention to represent Diana, and as her form and height are similar to your own, the mistake was very natural." "I am glaal she did not hear remarks, that must have caused her some annoyance." "Indeed, I think it would have been well if she had heard them.

"You are severe," said Eleanor. "No, not severe; only just." A little girl entered the room, and took her seat on Mr. De Vere's knee, with all the confidence of a petted favorite. "What has my little Adele been doing all day?" he asked, kissing her forehead. "I have been dressing my doll-babies, and feeding the white rabbits. There they go; they will eat up the flowers!" she exclaimed, as she sprang on the gallery. "She looks like a beautiful picture," said Eleanor. Mr. De Vere seemed pleased with the compliment paid to his only child. He asked Eleanor to go with him to the drawing-room, where he showed her a full-length portrait, which he said had been painted in Rome, a year or two before. There was the blue-eyed darling, lovely as" a poet's dream, stepping out of a brook, with her lap full of flowers. Arthur was soon absorbed in the contemplation of Thorwaldsen's "Jason," a noble statue, bearing on his arm the golden fleece. He was soon joined by his sister, who exclaimed: ' Arthur, you will be in your element here!

"Thorwaldsen knew how to manage his subject," he said, as he looked at the finely-formed limbs. 'Ihave given an order for his '"Psyche" and "Lute-player." I wish they were here, so that you might see them." "His works on religious subjects are his best, I be- lieve," remarked Arthur.  . "So I have understood. I saw one while in Copen- hagen. It was a large statue of Christ, in a standing posture. The arms were extended, and the hands open, as if inviting sinners to approach.

"It presented," he said, "a wider scope for the exercise of talent, and appealed more fre, quently to human sympathy." "Sculpture is limited, certainly," replied Mr. De tere, "but its effects are greater, and perhaps more lasting. Look at some of the relics of antiquity. Do they not stir the soul to its inmost depths, and become asfi gares of thought in the mind?" "True, but such excellence can only be obtained by the happiest strokes of the chisel. Action -or fervent passion are so difficult to express in sculpture, tha the forms she presents are principally in repose.

If you willgo with me to-morrow, to the mill, I will initiate you into the mysteries of sugar- "It will give me pleasure to accompany you. I have never had an opportunity of witnessing the process of sugar-mnaking." After breakfast the next morning, the whole party set off for the mill. Work was going on vigorously there. The machines were rapidly grinding the juice. from' the cane, which was afterward put into large kettles to be boiled. The heat was regulated by a thermometer, and the greatest care preserved in every particular.. The visitors were shown the long open boxes, where the mo- lasses was cooled, and even the hogsheads, in which it and the sugar were finally deposited. Indeed, they saw everything connected with the manufacture of these val- uable articles, and were greatly astonished at the minu- tims. They had never before formed any idea of the im- mense amount of labor required in these mills; and no longer wondered at the high prices o6 sugar and mo- lasses. Augusta declared that she would never taste either without thinking of that morning's visit. "What is the meaning of all these holes-?" asked Ha- rion, as they were returning from the- mill "They are filled with water, and I have narrowly escaped stepping into more than one of them."

The scene was lovely and peaceful, and everything so quiet, that the dove could be heart-cooing to its mate. Mr. De Vere asked Eleanor if she considered it a per- verted taste in him, to prefer the dull routine. of Ravens- wood, to the variety of the city. "On the contrary, I think it is much more agreeable here," she replied. "A few weeks spent in the city are pleasant enough; but for a life-time, give me the coun- trry. "How could any one tire of this beautiful place?" said Marion, who was sitting near them. "I could live here forever!" "Notwithstanding one would be afraid of one's life," said Mr. De Vere, archly. "And now for a game at ball," he added, as he descended the steps, with a basket of oranges on his arm. In an instant they were all on the green, like a set of wild children in a romp. But Captain Ryland assumed a military air, and gave a war-cry, "Barnet!" They formed themselves in battle array, and used their mimic weapons with much spirit. A white rose was soon held in' he'air. The Lancastrians threw down their arms, and with the words, "King Ed-      ' '  ^    *   *  ;: ]'-, l THE ARTISTS DEBAM.          5   - ward forever 1" from the Yorkists, both parties entered   :  the house.  '             - A red rose dropped from Augusta's hair, and was acci- dentally trodden upon by Captain Ryland, "My poor Lancastrian!" she exclaimed, in much dis- tress. He stooped to raise the foe, but life was extinct, and his fingers were stained with its crimson blood. The conversation turned upon the "War of the Roses," and  upon British chivalry, and admirable training. "I think," said Captain Ryland, "that one of the most remarkable instances of bravery and coolness was displayed, when the British were assisting the Spaniards to drive the French from their territory. Weary and dispirited as the troops were, at not being able to make their retreat from Corunna; yet, at the first discharge from the French battery, they seized their arms, and ar- ranged themselves with as much regularity and self-  possession as if on parade."        - "Sir John Moore was the master-spirit there," said  - Arthur. "Even Napoleon admitted his superior talents. I have often thought of what the feelings of soldiers must be, at having to leave their dead behind them. It must,  at least, be a mournful satisfaction to give them burial."'

"Few and short were the prayers we said, And we spoke not a word of sorrow; But we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead, And we bitterly thought of the morrow.

THE ARTIST'S DREAM.         97 97 At Mrs. De Vere's request, Eleanor seated herself at the piano, and her magical touch made the instrument     - speak. Some of Mozart's and Beethoven's pieces were   , performed with much taste and skill. Strain after strain of harmony was poured forth-an intertwining of exquisite melodies. When she had finished, Mr. De Vere proposed a quartette, and rang the bell to order the piano, (upon which his wife' usually practised,) to be removed from her sitting-room, into the front parlor. He placed him- self beside Eleanor, at one-instrument, while Marion and Augusta seated themselves at the other. The quartette was from Bellini's Opera Sonnambula, and was sauperbly rendered. Percy was asked to sing. He ran his fingers  lightly over the strings of the guitar, and sang the sim-   . pie and beautiful air, "The Mocking Bird." He pos-, sessed a voice of wonderful brilliancy and compass, and could perform the most'difficult solos of Handel, with ease and grace. Few persons cared to sing after hearing him; and another, and yet another song was called for, until the clock struck the hour of midnight. - Soon'. after : the ladies had retired, they were aroused by a serenade  on the water.

"An ambush of sweet snares, replete With love, desire, soft intercourse of hearts, And music of resistless whispered sounds." There Adonis,was crowned with flowers; and there Cupid lingered with his quiver and bow. There Orpheus lamented his lost Eurydice; and there might be seen "The noble sister of Poplicola, The moon of Rome; chaste as the icicle That's curdled by the frost, from purest snow, And hangs on Dian's temple."

"It is very fine indeed; and this child sleeping in a sea-shell of Parian marble is exquisite. How beautifully the features are cut; and what perfect repose is diffused throughout the figure! Every muscle is at rest." "Do not pass by this dear child," said Mr. De Vere, as Arthur was moving away.    "Is not my 'Hope' lovely, standing upon tip-toe, holding in her hand a triple-leaved grass?" "Lovely, indeed," he answered, looking long at the picture.

"The picture of her eye has motion in't As we are mock'd with art.'"' Arthur gazed in admiring wonder, at a large painting by Northcote,-a "Descent from the Cross;?' though he did not stand for hours before it, waiting for Christ to come down, as Murillo is said to have done, before the famous "Descent from the Cross," by Juan Campana, in the Cathedral at Seville. Arthur's attention was, at- tracted to a stalwart Indian chief, arranging his bow and arrows in front of his wigwam. His head was adorned with feathers of various colors; and his arms were covered with scars, denoting the number- of victims he had slain in battle. A fair young girl sat in the shade of a birch tree, in all the abandonment of grief. Her eyes, which matched the heavens in their blue, were filled with tears; and her long luxuriant hair fell loosely around her like a mantle of gold. She was a hostage- a daughter of the despised white race; and her appear- ance formed a striking contrast to that of the swarthy chief. The summer moons had passed, and the autum- nal sun lighted up tree and wigwam, river and shore. There was, in the- collection, a portrait of a young Zingali in all her native grace, by Pacheco; and the "Loves of the Angels " in pastel. At the further end of the gallery was a large painting, set in a massive frame of elaborate workmanship. The artist's subtile skill had traced in tree and rodk, in vine and rill, the outlines of divinest grace.

"Their beauty makes you glad." WORDSWORTH. DE VERE gave a large party to her young guests. The suite of parlors at Ravenswood were divided by arches supported by lofty pillars, of beautiful workmanship. The walls and ceilings were ele- gantly frescoed. The silken couches and chairs sank into downy softness, beneath the slightest pressure. The mantles, tables, and chandeliers, were adorned with rare flowers and lighted by wax candles of various colors. The soft air stole in through -the rich curtains. Enchant- ing music floated through the rooms and mingled with the perfume of the flowers. As it was Leap Year, it had been arranged that the ladies should act the part of the gentlemen; and cards to that effect were given to each guest on his or her arrival.  / "There is a beautiful girL Pray let me introduce you," said Mrs. De Vere to Augusta, who was walking through the parlors in search of a partner for the dance. Augusta raised her glass. "The arrangement of her hair gives her the appearance of a Major General on parade, and her color is scarcelynatural," she said, with admirable sang-froid.   THE ARTIST'S DRE  .       107 "I did not mean her, but the lady in pink tarlatan." "Ah, quite pretty; but she has no style, I wish one who can serve as a model for Corinne." The circuit of the rooms was made before her fastidious taste could be suited. The favored gentleman was a young swell-head of New Orleans, an insufferable egotist, who prided him- self on his wealth and personal appearance. Augusta was not slow in discerning this; and heartily wished that fashion had clothed him. for this one evening at least, in long skirts that could be accidentally torn. But she consoled herself for this defect in his attire, by inwardly vowing to tread upon his toes if she had half a chance. "The heat is oppressive. Permit me to fan you," she said, when the dance was ended. Does 'not I this remind you of Theocritus?" she added, taking an antique drinking-cup from the mantelj and examining its curious workmanship. "A deep two-handled cup, whose brim is'crowned With ivy joined with helichryse around : Small tendrils with close clasping arms uphold The fruit, righ speckled with the seeds of gold." Her companion stared. "Here is a fine engraving of Lake Pontchartrain, with a partial view of- the Shell Road," she said with ready tact; as she drew one from a large portfolio. That was better'adapted to his com- prehension; and he went into a rhapsody about- the races, his " two-forty " always winning, of course.

On they went, those high pressure boats, rushing, hissing, groaning like sea- monsters in mortal agony. The excitement was very great, and bets ran high. Cracklins were mixed with the fuel, in order to increase the speed of the Blackhawk. Sofas, chairs, and tables were cut to pieces and thrown into the flames, whereupon the Captain was dryly asked if the passengers were to be consumed next. For some time the steamers kept pace; but the Blackhawk gained headway, amid the cheers and shouts of her crew.   THE ARTIST'S DEEAXM       11i CHWAPTEI  XVI.'

Old Boreas was in a furious mood, and gave them a most ungracious reception. It was late Satur- day evening when they reached the Cave Hotel. Mrs. St. Clair remarked, that she hoped they would all be suf- ficiently recovered from the fatigue of their journey to visit the cave the next day, as she would like to leave on Monday for Louisville. Most of the party objected to this, partly on account of its being an improper manner of spending the Sabbath, and partly because they would be unable to see all they desired, in so short a time. Mrs. St. Clair argued .that they could see what people i generally saw in one visit, and that was quite enough to talk about hereafter. That was a new light in which to view the matter; but it was evident that her mind was made up, and her companions reluctantly consented to accompany her. The proprietor, however, objected to furnish them  with a guide, saying, that when persons chose to go on the Long Route on Sunday the responsi-  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC8157-00000054"/> "2        THE ARTIST'S DREAM. bility rested with themselves.  One of the guides, black as the ace of spades, volunteered his services.   The la- dies attired themselves in Turkish costume, with crimson scarfs and pretty liitle jockey hats; and at nine o'clock on Sunday morning the party marched into the mouth of the cave, which certainly did not invite entrance. "Hush! for my heart-blood curdles as we enter, To'glide in gloom these shadowy realms about; Oh, what a scene!--the round globe, to its centre, To form this awful cave, seems hollowed out! Yet pause-no mystic word yet hath been spoken To win us entrance to this .awful sphere-- A whispered prayer must be our watchword token, And peace-like that around us-peace unbroken, The passport here.

Augusta declared that she had herself expected to see Plu- to seated on his throne, guarded by Cerberus. The guide directed attention to wheel tracks, and to the footprints of oxen, made while saltpetre was being manufactured during the last war with Great Britain. Ruts were also pointed out, and the remarkable preservation of the wood was duly discussed. In the explanation of the. guide, so much stress was laid on the year 1812, that one might have supposed it the beginning of time; and that. 'every important event transpired within that period. After passing through the "Methodist Church," where they were told the Gospel had-been preached more than a half century before, they stopped in front of a rock, forty feet in length, which all instantly declared must be the "Giant's Coffin." "Who knows but what Titus rests beneath this stone?" remarked Captain Ryland. "That is-not possible,"re- plied Arthur, "as Mythology tells us that his body covers nine acres of ground. It would be' a fit receptacle for Polhemus, or one of the Cyclops." After a glance at the Ant-eater, and passing a few moments in the "Deserted Chamber," which Augusta maintained was not deserted at all, as they were in it,they scrambled with much dif- ficulty up and down the "Steeps of Time." When they reached the "Bridge of Sifghs," and the dark recesses of the "Pit" were illuminated, the scene was wild and   &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC8157-00000055"/> "4        THE ARTIST'S DREAM. fantastic.

Some minutes were passed in "Revelers' Hall;" then the party sojourned for a while in the "Valley of Humility," clad in sackcloth and ashes-a very necessary process, preparatory to going through the "Scotchman's Trap," and "Fat Man's Misery." Much physical incon- venience was endured by all, but Captain Ryland, being rather corpulent, twisted, writhed and groaned, in flesh and spirit; but finally, with a feeling of profound grati- tude, emerged into "Great Relief."  He straightened himself, expressing, at the same time, some doubt as to the safety of his scalp. But Arthur (whom the Captain always said had mistaken his calling) pronounced it in a good state of preservation, and the company proceeded to the "Bacon Chamber." "f Help yourselves to a substantial dinner, my friends," said Augusta. "We will take our dessert in Martha's Vineyard,'" where 'Bacchus, that first from out the purple grape Crushed the sweet poison of misused wine,' holds his orgies." Alas, for good shoes! thought the par- ty, as they traversed the "Great Walk.", The sail on "Echo River" was charming. Mrs. St. Clair requested   THE ARTIT'S DEA. Am115 Percy to sing the "Echo Song." Oh, the wonderfxl power of that voice! It was- deepened and extended, until it sounded-like a full-toned instrument, thrilling the heart of every hearer. Several pieces were sung in concert, and the delicious harmony swelled and rolled along the dark waters, edho- ing far in the distance. s; I wish so much it was not Sunday, and that we had a band of music with us!" exclaimed Augusta.. "Why not wish for Orpheus, or Amphion, to charm our subterranean voyage?" replied Marion. "This pass is well named," said Arthur, as he nearly slipped up in the "Infernal Region." After- the exertion of climbing the "Hill of Fatigue," and after a look at the "Great Western," they rested in "Ole Bull's Concert Room."' While viewing   the savage grandeur of "'El Ghor," they concluded that Phlegyas must be standing in deadly terror beneath- one of the "Hanging Rocks." "Would that all the flies in the universe were congre- gated here," exclaimed Mrs. St. Clair, as she surveyed the ceiling of the "Fly Chamber."   i "Shall: we place this 'Crown' upon your head, and proclaim you queen of these dolorous regions?' said Percy to Augusta. "'Uneasy is the head that wears a drown.' Cer- tainlythe words are very appropriate in this case," she smilingly replied.

Captain Ryland remarked, that some one at the hotel had informed him, that a marriage once took place in the Cave. "Is it possible!" ." What could have winuced them to select such la spot!" and such like ex- clamations, were heard on every side. "I suppose, the ceremony was- performed in the 'Methodist Church,'" said Augusta, raising a glass of sherry to her lips. "No, in the 'Gothic Chapel,' I believe." "It is to be hoped, the bride did not confound the Catechism with the marriage ceremony, as I heard a lady once did in New England. When the minister asked, ' Wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband, to live together after God's ordinance, in the holy state of mat- rimony? Wilt thou obey him, and serve him; love, honor, and keep him in sickness and in health; and, for- sating all others, keep :thee only unto him, so long as ye both shall live?' she answered, 'Yes, verily; ant by God's help so I will. And I heartily thank our heavenly Father, that He hath called me to this state of salvation, through Jesus Christ our Saviour; and I pray unto God, to give me His grace, that I may continue in the same unto my life's end.'" "The disciples of Terpsichore could not conveniently hold their-revels here," continued Augusta, "and that would be sufficient objection for me. If I should ever marry, it would be for the opportunity of giving a grand ball"    -THE ARBTisTs DB1V -      3 ," What Would become of the marriage-vow?" as'ked Arthur. "Is it so serious .'

"Nature has surpassed herself here." As they climbed the "Rocky Mountains," Arthur  asked his aunt if she knew she had walked nearly nine  miles, "No, I am not much fatigued," she replied, "but how will we ever walk nine miles back?" When they reached the sumrmit, they examined "Cleopatra's Needle," and looked down into "Dismal Hollow." In "Groghan's Hall," Percy placed a beautiful lime- stone stalactite in his pocket, saying that he intended to have ornaments made of it, for the queen of these dolor- ous regions. "A cricket! a cricket!" exclaimed Augusta, as one vainly struggled intier hand for its liberty. "Its chirp- ing days are over; for Ii shall put it inm alcohol, as soon as we get to the hotel." The guide explained that the Cave crickets never chirped; and offered to try to procure an eyeless fish for her, when they recrossed "Echo River." Some. of the gen- tlemen suggested that one of the frogs, which are said to croak to the echo of their own voices, should also be procured to grace her cabinet. They retraced their steps-very' slowly, however, as they wished to re- examine the various curiosities, and impress them more -clearly on their minds.   ..'. THE-'ARTIT'S DRAM.          119 Scene after scene was passed.   Arthur thought of the beautiful lines, written by Mrs. Welby, after visiting this" "Wonder of the West." 'Ye glittering caves, ye high o'erhanging arches,  A pilgrim band, we glide amid your gloom, With breathless lips, and high uplifted torches, All fancifully decked in cave costume. Far from the day's glad beams, and songs, and flowers, We've come with spell-touched hearts, To glide, enchanted for a few brief hours, '  - Through the calm beauty of your awful bowers, And o'er your waves!

"It is strange,' said Arthur, sternly, "that you should have neglected so important a duty. But I have under- stood that there are depots for oil, within the cave." "They chance to be empty to-day, sir," replied the guide, some-what discoinerted at the rebuke he had so justly received. "Such a thing never happened before." "It is to be hoped not. I think we had better leave the cave with him," said Arthur, turning to his compan- ions. The guide insisted that he could walk much more rapidly without them; and urged them to remain where' they were, while he went to the hotel, to procure the -necessary oil. Promising to return as quickly as possible, he started on his errand. The' ladies and gentlemen seated them- selves on the ground, with their lamps beside them. Their situation was novel indeed.' Captain Ryland complimented the ladies on the picturesque effect of their I cloaks and turbans. "I dare say we look very romantic," said Mrs. St. Clair; "but I, for one, do not feel so. This place is like ; a vast catacomb." They talked lightly for a while, on indifferent subjects, but the conversation gradually assumed a graver tone. They spoke of the consumptives, who had dwelt within the cave; and of the sad effects of darkness upon their   "THE ARtISt'S DEEAM   .    121- systems. Augusta declared, with her usual volubility, that nothing would induce her to spend a night there. She was sure she would die of fright; and so on. Ar- thur thought of the instances recorded, of persons who had wandered from their companions, and had lost their reason, from  being left alone in the darkness. He thought it most prudent, however, to say nothing on this subject. .Hour after hour rolled on, and they became very uneasy. Mrs. St. Clair suggested that'they should endeavor to find their way out of the cave. But Arthur told her it would be risking their lives to do so, and that there was no alternative. "I am not surprised," said Eleanor, "that Dr. KEane thought the darkness of the Arctic night such a solemn thing. How he endured its horrors, in his delicate state of health, I can scarcely imagine.

THEE ARTIST'S DR'EAm V In relation to the imprisonment of the children, Chau- cer said, ,that it was "' great cruelte Such birdes for to put in such a cage." Fictitious as this part of the story may be, Dante has fully vented his wrath against Pisa. 'Ah, Pisa! thou that shame and scandal be To the sweet land that speaks the tongue of Si, Since Florence spareth thy vile neck the yoke, Would that the very isles would rise and choke Thy river, and drown every soul within Thy loathsome walls. What if this Ugolin Did play the traitor, and give up (for so The rumor runs) thy castles to the foe, Thou hadst no right to put to rack like this His children; Childhood innocency is." O wonderful Dante I truly may it be said of him, "Hell grows darker at his frown." "Matthews wonders, in his 'Diary of an Invalid,'" said Arthur, " that the poets have made no use of (sea-sick- ness,) in describing the place of torment; and thinks it might have afforded .them  useful hints, for improving the horrors of their hells. 'The consolations of hope,' he says, 'are denied to none save the damned and the sea-sick.' Surely Dante could never have been sea-sick, or he would have inflicted that terrible malady upon some of the inhabitants of his Inferno. Not all his pun- istnents, I should think, could equal the throes of sea- Msickness." Mr. Hunt, spealng of the Inferno, asks "Cui bono?"    THE ARTIST'S DREAM.        129 nd says, that "even in a theological point of view, the i-.    if milder shades of purgatory ' are something like a bit of Christian refreshment, after the horrors of the Infer- no." How beautifully Dante has described the scene, which presents itself after emerging from the hideous vault. The. delicious air, the sky of-"sweetest oriental sapphire." How the planet"madeallthaorient laugh;" and how the four northern stars, which had not been seen since the time of Adam and Eve, seemed to cause heaven to rejoice in their lustre. How beautiful is the part, where the pilgrims descry, in the distance, the trembling of the sea. How the an- gel, who conducts departed spirits to Purgatory, is wit$- out sail or oar; and unveils his splendors, in the shape of wings and garments-his face being too intensely bright to be gazed upon. How; when Dante attempts to return the affectionate embraces of Casello, "his arms again and again find themselves crossed on his own 'bosom, having encircled nothing." And when he asked the shadow, to sing to him one of the soft airs, with which he was wont to beguile his weariness on earth; Casello selected one of Dante's own poems. Howhu- morous the meeting, with the idle Belacqua; who even in Purgatory does not think it worth his while to hasten - his steps, as he is doomed to walk round the foot of the mountain, for as many years as he has delayed repent/- ance.

Then the part that the Pro- venal -poet Sordello accompanies the pilgrims to the hollow, covered with flowers, which surpass the loveliest dyes; and grass, which is greener and brighter than emeralds newly troken."  The friagrance, that arises from the hollow, and the chant to the Virgin, beginning "Salve Regina:" sung by the souls, sitting among the flowers. And those lines on the evening-how exquisite I Then the angel, clad in ash-colored robes; who opens the portals of Purgatory, with keys of gold and silver; and the voices which meet the pilgrim's ears, on their entrance, chanting that glorious hymn "Te Deum lauda- mus." The terrible noise which announces the presence of Oain--the intense silence that ensues. How'surpassingly elegant is Dante's answer to the question of Buonaggiunta, as to whether heis the au- thor of a certain poem-- "I am one that notes When Love inspires; and what he speaks, I tell In his own way, embodying but his thoughts." And when he wanders through the forest, whose ver- dure offers refreshing shade,-the pure invigorating at- mosphere,-the birds singing for joy, at the brightness- of the morning,--the "trees themselves joining in the concert with 'a swelling breath, like that which rises among the' pines of Chiassi, when Eolus lets loose the south wind, and the gathering melody comes rolling through the forest from bough to bough."

What a happy simile is it, w hen heasks Piceardo, and her sister spirits, if they do not desire greater bliss, and they "gently smile and answer, with faces as happy as first love, that they will only, what it pleaseth God to give them, and therefore are truly blest." How lovingly he compalres'Beatrice to "the bird that sits among ithe dewy leaves in the darkness of night, yearning for the coming of the morning, that she, may again behold her young, and have light by which to seek the food that renders hpr fatigue for them a joy."

The sun rose high in the heavens; but there were some eyes that could not be gladdened by its beams. All was confusion -and alarm at the Cave Hotel. It Oas remembered that the New York guests had gone into the cave the previous day, and had not been heard of since. ITmmediately after breakfast, the proprietor went with a guides in search of them. They looked carefully about them, as they went along, and presently gave a loud halloo. Their voices rang through the vaulted chambers, and corridors, reverberating far in the distance. Then a death-like silence reigned. On they went. Again they shouted, and again only echo answered. Their sense of hearing had been strained until effort became painful. Not a sound was heard. They looked at one another in silence, each being unwilling to express his fears. Once more they shouted. Hark! was not that a human.  voice, faint indeed, but human?

Their hearts were- too full for words; and they silently followed the guide. Eleanor was weak and dizzy. She fell against a rock aind hurt her ankle, and was with difficulty carried out of the cave. A physician was sum- moned; he found that the ankle was sprained, and the hip injured; but to what extent could not then be ascer- tained. Examination was so painful, and Eleanor was so much exhausted from fatigue and loss of sleep, that Mr. Cavendish left a mild narcotic, promising to return in the evening. Investigation was made as to the cailse of the party being left so long in the cave. It turned out the guide met some of his boon companions, on reaching the realms of light, and could not resist getting on a "spree."  He afterward deemell it advisable to leave that part of the country, for a time at least. Ma- rion was so much indisposed as to be compelled to keep her room for several days after the adventure related in the last chapter; but 'she was soon restored to her usual health, and promised to accompany Augusta and the gentlemen on the short route. Mrs. St. Clair could-not be persuaded, to enter the cave again. 'It was a bright, beautiful afternoon, when the party followed their trust- worthy guide into the realms of Erebus. "Oh, the everlasting giant and giantess!",exclaimed a Augusta, as they stopped before a group of figures on the ceiling.

The, dark firmament studded with innumerable stars, the comet, the soft moonlight. Clouds passed overthe sky, betokening an approaching  storm. The heavens became more and more overcast, until the most intense darkness prevailed-darkness such as one mightfeel. In the awful silence that followed, one could count the pulsations of one's own heart. Was there no escape from these dreary dominions? Were they forever cut off from light and hope?

"Your arm, Arthur, if you please," said Mrs. St. Clair, as they prepared 'to ascend the steps leading to the Gothic- Arcade. "I think it will be of great assistance to me, the guide's opinion to the contrary, notwithstand- ing."

A lamp was suspended from each of the large stAlaotites, that supportthe ceiling, and in that shadowy light, one felt an almost irresistible impulse to kneel in silent awe. Would some cloistered nun glide past! some venerable monk be seen bending over his- rosary; or would some Bishop descend from his Cathedral splendor, to give ab- solution to the faithful, in this Chapel of Nature? "I am sorry that Vulcan is not at his anvil, forging thunderbolts for Father Jupiter," said the Captain, as he looked at the charred cinders, in the "Smithy." After examining, with a military eye, "Bonaparte's  ) Breastworks," -he approached the "Devil's Arm-chair"' "This is quite too comfortable a, seat, for his satanic majesty," he said, throwing himself into it. "You nighet personate him," said Augusta. "In that case, you will have to make your obeissance to me, as my subject." t "King of Hell, I salute thee!" she said. "How' very unkind, Miss Summers, to fancy -me like his Imperial Highness, even in appearance.' Perhaps, in your opinion,' I would compare unfavorably, even with' Dante's Satan." "Rather more presentable," she replied, "inasmuch as you have a single face; and are not devouring even one sinner, much less three. Only- the most irascible of poets could have conceived such a 'banquet of honors. "  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC8157-00000066"/> 186       THE ARTIST'S DREAM.      . "Neither of my arms are as large as a giant, it is true," said the Captain, "but' I can toss them, and ren- der myself in some'degree like a wind-mill in motion. As to wings, I might procure those of a bat, as than animal hibernates in the cave. They would be rather diminutive, certainly; but. when flapped, would produce a considerable quantity of wind; though not enough to freeze everything in Tartarus."        , "We will now leave you to the enjoyment of your dreary realm," said Augusta. "The sovereign of this dreary realm craves the honor of being your humble servant," he said, rising and fol- lowing her to the "Elephant's Head."  Jokes were freely circulated at the "Lover's Leap." Captain Ryland said that he supposed Percy would peep several times over the rock, as Diogenes did over the promontory of Leucate, and retreat. "As to myself," he added, " if I were sure of escaping as well as Aridseus, I would make the leap. I would not care much for the loss of a couple of front teeth, and as to my nose, I dare say it would be improved by a little flattening. Will you not imitate Sappho, the Lesbian?" he continued, as he turned to Marion, " and attire yourself like a bride, be- fore talring the leap? You might be transformed into a swan, as you fall." "I could not, like Sappho, carry in my hand a musical instrument of my own invention; neither could I com- pose verses, so my leap would be less remarkable than hers," replied Marion. "The metamorphosis was very       TEN -ARTIST'S DREAM-  137 poetical, I grant. But, in the event I did not pass through the same, I should certainly fall seventy feet to the bottom of this ugly pit; which would be even more terrible than being enveloped by the waters of the Ionian- Sea." After surveying the other curiosities of the Arcade, the party prepared to leave the cave. "Do you know that you are under the dining-room of the hotel?" asked the guide, as they entered the "Ro- tunda." "'Mercy, no!" cried Augusta. "Let us get out as soon as possible. It must be nearly tea-time, and if this roof should give way, the tables and crockery would fall on our heads, to say nothing of the house and people." "First, I propose that we shall lay the foundation of Matte Monument," with the hope that it riray soon be the height of 'Nicholas's Monument,' in 'Wrighti Ro- tunda,' " said Captain Ryland, picking up a stone and talding it to another part of the Rotunda. His com- panions followed his example, amid the bows and smiles of the guide. Arthur proposed that at some future time, they should make an effort to go over all the ground that had been explored. "-What, one hundred miles!" exclaimned his sister. The guide remarked that discoveries were constantly t being made, and that many of the avenues had never been visited by tourists. on reaching the outer world, they found the ground quite -damp, and some leaves of the post -oak,'that Ar-  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC8157-00000067"/> 138       THE ARTIST'S DREAM. thur pulled were covered with moisture. A gentleman informed them that soon after they entered the cave, the weather changed, and there had been a storm of rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning,; adding, that of course they could have known nothing of it, as thun- der was never heard in the cave. The next morning they mounted into an ambulance, and afterl jolting and tumbling about for three miles, over a break-neck road, alighted at a logcabin. They sat down on benches that were placed around the walks, until the guide should arrange the camps, and then de- scend a short flight of wooden steps. The avenues were so narrow as to compel them to walk in single file on the plank floor. Captain Ryland threatened to turn gipsy, and carry off the -Dressed Chicken," that hung so tempt- ingly from the ceiling. Unlike the lammmth, Proctor's Cave is exceedingly damp, but the visitors felt repaid for the discomforts they endured, by-the sight of the great variety of (stalactite and stalagmite formations, that abound there, the number and grandeur of the domes, more particularly the "Curtain Dome," with its wonder- ful drapery and scrolls. "How delightful the sunshine is!" said Marion, as she breathed the outer air once more. "I confess to being thoroughly chilled." A fire was soon kindled in the front of the cabin, and all were glad to feel its warmth and brightness. They refreshed themselves with champagne, and admired the wild character of the scenery. h"   THE ARTIST'S DREAM.        139 "If there were robbers here, they would find good hiding-place in this cavernous region," said the Cap- tain, as he e tered the ambulance. Eleanor's ihdisposition afforded her friends ample time for underground travel; and they made the trips to the smaller caves very leisurely. "There is nothing like early morning air, for the pre- servation of youth, health, and beauty," said Captain Ryland, as he saw Marion enter the hotel, fresh  and blooming as Hebe, after her customary morning walk. "And that reminds one of the infinite variety of ex- quisite theories that nobody feels willing to render prac- tical." He made an engagement withi Marion and Augusta, to go with them the next morning, on an exploring expedi- tion. He rallied the former on her habit of early risig, saying that he supposed they would have to be up, 'Brushing with hasty steps the dew away,- To meet the sun upon the upland lawn."' "You need not be alarmed," she answered, laughing; "I have no intention of taking you out on an empty stomach." Arthur and Percy joined the party.  The air was still and pleasant when they set out. The robins hopped 'from branch to branch, on their approach, as if seeking to hide themselves from   their inquisitive eyes. The grass was looking quite springlike. All were good walkers, and roads, fields'and woods were traversed without much fatigue.   At last Marion  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC8157-00000068"/> "O       THE ARTIST'S DREAM.      ' proposed stopping at a house near by, to rest. It was not a pretty rustic retreat, half hidden by vines, suggest- ing thoughts of "love in a cottage;" but a rough, un- sightly dwelling. A knock at the door was answered by an old woman, whoseappearance accorded with the sur- roundings. Her dregs was disorderly, and on her head' was perched a white muslin cap, trimmed with lace and faded ribbons-a tawdry piece of finery evidently put on for the occasion. To the question, "Will you allow us to rest here, for a little while?" she readily replied, "To be sure I will, walk in." And she bustled about to pro- cure chairs. A log of wood blazed cheerily in the large, * old-fashioned fire-place; and a cat sat on the hearth, washing her face. On the whitewashed wall, hung a flaming picture of Jonah being swallowed by the whale, covered with cracked glass, and set in a frame of red wood. The dame inquired if her visitors "lived any- where in these parts?"When Augusta replied that they were staying a short time at the Cave Hotel, she raised her longhands, and ejaculated: "Goodness gracious! why, no wonder you are tired. That's several miles from here. May I ax where you got that stuff?". she continued, surveying Marion's styl- ish-looking dress, with admiring eyes. "It's the prettiest thing I've seen for many a day." "I purchased it in New York," was the reply. -"And pray where may that be? I s'pose you got your bonnet there. That's perty too, but nothen compared to the face that's in it. Sich eyes I never seen in a body's   THE ARTIST'S DREAM.       141 head.

Betsey Jane and Euphemia Araminty, says I, you may take my word for it, plain colors is sure sign of genteelness." Arthur changed the conversation, by asking after her health. "Health," she repeated, " why I've got no health. I've got a pain in my head, a pain in my face, apain in my neck, a pain in my shoulder, a pain in my chest, a pain in my stomach, and I haint well nohow." "A bundle of pains as usual,?' said her spouse,. who entered the room at this juncture. "Always a grumblen, grumblen, grumblen. Sich a dance as you've led me these thirty years." /t "Come, Jacob, you know we haint been married thirty years." "Thirty years," he repeated emphatically; "thirty years come Whitswtide." ' The visitors, anticipating a matrimonial squabble, rose Ito depart. As some as they were out of hearing, they burst into a peal of laughter. Augusta amused herself by making allusions to Marion's "black beads."

"I confess to being reay hungry.  The sight of yonder pond, puts me n a mood for angling. If there was an Iceland geyser here, we might cook some fish." The wind, which had been gradually rising, blew a per- fect hurricane before they reached home. It was no re- specter of persons, for it dashed dust into the faces of ^ the ladies, and took unpardonable liberties with their at- tire. They held down their veils, while they secretly wished the inventor of hoop skirts at the botom of the Black Sea. The gentlemen's coat tails flapped, and their hats rolled on the ground, while they ran like school- boys in pursuit. Some chickens, which were unfortu- nate enough to be out, were like little balls of down at the mercy of the wind. Even the grown-up members of the feathered tribe sometimes lost their footing. "I am glad you have come," said DMs. St. Clair, as the walking party joined her in the parlor; "I was apprehensive you might be blown away." "And not without reason," returned Augusta. "But fortunately we are made of substantial flesh and blood, so here we are."  I "I suppose I ought to apologize for presenting this dandelion," said Percy, approaMching her. "I picked it up just before we came into the house. It is the first I have seen. I have great regard for the dandelion. It is al- most the first flower that comes to cheer us after the long winter."  "Thank you," said Augusta. "My poor little dan-   THE ARTIST'S DRF:AU         143 D delion," she continued, as she placed it in a glass of water.

In a-few minutes, Mr. and: Miss Cav- endish were announced. Keturah was the eldest daughter of Dr. Cavendish-a tall dignified girl of eighteen years. She was like Ken- tucky ladies in general, a fine equestrian. Indeed horse- 'manship was one of her father's hobbies. He was a portly, fine looking man; who, if report was true, had been as handsome in his youth as Abdallah, whose personal and mental attractions had caused two hundred virgins of the tribe of Koreish to die of broken hearts on the night of his bridal. 1His children, nine in number, (a pair of steps as he called them,) were robust and active. The -sons had been taught to ride as soon asthey could stride a horse, and Howard, cwho was at Yale, astonished even the students by his wild exploits. The girls were brought up on the equestrian system also, though not so strictly as the boys. Margaret, the second daughter, better known as Madge Wildfire, was quite celebrated for her feats in this department. She galloped over thb country with her elf locks flying in the wind, and sometimes joined in the chase with her father andbrothers. The manage- ment of her favorite steed Bucephalus, was admirable. He was a noble, high-spirited animal, and did not always feel i. the humor to' brook restraint. Then a contest was sure to ensue, in which Madge always came off vic- torious. She made him bear his head proudly, advance, go back, turn on either hand, pace, trot, and gallop to perfection. When the Doctor wished to impress the importance )    , 2           TH E XRTIST'S DREAM.        145 of out-door exercise on the minds of any of his lady patients, he would point with pardonable pride, to his two eldest daughters, who he said were neither pale nor languid, and could walk and ride equal to the English ladies. Keturah reminded one of a fresh peach, and the blood seemed'ready to start from the clear dark skin of Madge. Sometimes a gleam of wildness shone in the misty depths of her dark eyes, and her laugh sounded like the carol of a bird. Think oflMadge in tight stays, and breathing the suffocating atmosphere of a crowded ball-room! Her balls were held on the ice. While her sisters tumbled down and received the gallantries of the gentlemen, she, stood erect and firm. Indeed she was the most expert skater in all the country, " striking out boldly with the left foot," and skimming the ice like a graceful bird. Madge was Nature's playmate, a " child of the forest! strong and free." She bounded like a gazelle over the woodlands, gathering hyacinths, polyan- thus, half-blown lilies, and all the fairy treasures of spring, to lay at her mother's feet. She bent over the brooks to pluck the first wild flowers that grew on the margin; though she did not, Narcissus like, fall in love with the image reflected there. She loved all the dogs as well as the horses on her father's place, and often patted the sleek sides of the cows, as the dairy-maid milked them. At fifteen she was still skipping the rope, and revelling in her wild freedom. Her mother often said that she ex- pected to see her brought home some day with a broken leg or neck.  Mrs. Cavendish did not altogether approve 7   &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC8157-00000071"/> "6 -      THE ARTIST'S DREAM. of the training of her children, but owing to ill-health, she did not see a great deal of them. She was silent and reserved, and had an odd way of dozing early in the evening-a habit which, her husband asserted, could be overcome by following the example of the Lord Chancel- lor of England, and binding wet towels around her head. When Keturah and Ellersley returned from the hotel, they found their parents in the study; Mrs. Cavendish askedif they had a pleasant visit. "Very," replied Ke- turah." "How strikingly handsome Miss Lee is!" ex- claimed her brother. "She has the most expressive eyes and mouth I ever saw, and such a complexion! Do you know, sir, to which one of the young ladies Mr. Sey- mour is engaged?" he added, turning abruptly to his father, who was leaning back, pen in hand. "Really, I never inquired," said the Doctor, indiffer- ently, and resumed his writing. It was plain that no in- formation was to be gained in that quarter, and Ellersley turned on his heel, thinking that his father looked very much as if he had swallowed a box of his own pills. From a remark dropped by Captain Ryland, he had in- ferred that Percy was engaged to one of the ladies of his own party, and somehow he found himself hoping that it was not Marion.

Eleanor was better than she had been since her accident, and Dr. Cavendish had promised that she might go into the parlor, in a day or two, and lie upon the sofa. Marion played until Augusta rose, and said it was bed- time. "First join me in a duet. My soul is full of music, and now, good night." Not wishing to alarm her mother, Eleanor had re- quested that she should not be apprised of her situation. It was hoped, that she would be able to travel in a short time.

He had been an, orphan since childhood; and, like many persons in the same situation, had been very much cut off from the society of his relatives. Perhaps it was for that very reason, that his love for Eleanor was deeper, that it became an all-absorbing passion.  He sat hour after hour, by her side, conversing with, or reading to her. Sometimes they enjoyed long intervals of silence-silence so full of thought and feeling. -"Leaning face to face, With sweet half listenings for each other's breath." "It is so selfish, to keep you here," she said to him, one day. "(It is my pleasure, to be here," he replied!"If itwere not for your sufferings, I should be very happy, for I see you alone much oftener than I could do under other-cir- cumstances."

"I should thinkl the romance of wedded life would be over, after five-and-twenty years," was the reply. Thursday was a true April day--a mixture of smiles and tears.

"Are you not going to the wedding, Miss Marion?" asked Percy, who had been with Eleanor for the last hour. "No!"Eleanor remonstrated.,. No one must thinkl of staying on her account. She was doing very well, and it would be so pleasant, at the doctor's. "Very pleasant, I have no doubt," replied Marion, "but I prefer spending the evening with you. Will you not trust her to me?" she added, turning to Percy. Be- fore he could answer, Augusta hastily opened the door, and exclaimed, "Good-bye, Eleanor. Do come, Mr. Seymour, they are all waiting at the coach." With a hurried bow, he left the room, talcing his hat from a table, as he walked through the open passway. He seated himself opposite Mrs. St. Clair and Augusta, in the hotel coach, which had been engaged for the oc- casion. After a drive of nearly two hours, they arrived at the residence of Dr. Cavendish-a large, substantial brick house, situated on "A gentle hill, Green, and of mild declivity." No lofty trees " in circular array," crowned the height. But the chestnut, the oak, the black-jack, the walnut, and that most graceful of all trees, the elm, grew at ir- regular distances.

Arthur replied that he graduated at the Universiy t year before, and that his thesis was the admiration all the professors. He was still attending the lectur, and' improving himself in everypossible way.

Arthur, if what-I have understood is correct,-that the reputation of physicians is dependent upon the opinion of their professional brethren." A little girl, appa- rently five years of age, and a boy several years older approached, at this moment; and presented a wreath, composed of twenty-five white roses twined with myr- tle. The doctor introduced them by saying, "'this is our little Empress Eugenie, and this one our son Dick." Arthur admired the fair-haired Eugenie; and drew the little boy to his side. "So your name is Richard," he said. "There's no Richard about it," replied the boy. "My name is Dick, only Dick." "Oh, Dic, then;-well Dick, do you go to school?" Dick's eys sparkled as he said, "No sir, Mr. Lazeroy our teacher, has gone away." 1"There is a story connected with that," said the doc- tor, laughing, "And why did Mr. Lazeroy go away?" Dick needed no further encouragement to tell his story. "I was called on to recite my Latin lesson, and made a dead stop at the past participle of offero. Mr. Lazeroy told me to go on. I said I couldn't; so, I was put upon the dunce's stool, with a paper cap on my head. I was dreadfully mortified, and so scared that I couldn't study. When the scholars were dismissed, I was locked up in the school-room, to study until bed-time. Harry was locked up too. He had been chewing pieces of paper and spitting them on the ceiling; and pulling Madge Wild- fire's hair. The school-room is off by itself, in the back/ t. * ..    THE ARTISTS DREAM.,       165 yard. A tub had been -placed under the spout to catch the water, for the rain was coming down in pitchforks. About nine o'clock, we heard a tremendous splash, and somebody crying out, 'Oh, mercy!' Harry and I ran to the 'window, but the night was so dark we could see nothing. "Oh, Dick," said Harry, trying to smother his laugh- ter, "I do expect it is the whale floundering in- the tub (we always called Mr. Lazeroy the whale, when we got angry with him)--and sure enough it was. He- was com- ing to let us out, and could not see the tub on account of the darkness, and so tumbled in. He got out and crept into the house; but suffered for days, with contusion of the head. He would never believe that Harry and I did not plan the whole thing; and he left the house, vowing he would not teach such refractory urchins. Ever since he went we have had such a good time." "And such a good time you will not have much- long- er," said his father; "I am on the- lookout for a teacher, who will put you and Master Harry into strait jackets, when you play your mad pranks; and who will give you something to do besides learning a little Latin, and writing silly rhymes--love and dove, bright and light,"-- "and fight," chimed in Dick, who was rather belligerent. The children were privileged-this evening. Even the baby of the house-the little girl, who had peeped at the ladies, was brought into the parlor for a few minutes. The doctor's attention was called to fresh guests. Ar- thur took an album from a table near him, and was soon attracted by the photograph of a little girl, in a kneeling * ,"                  ;  -     \  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC8157-00000076"/> 156       THE ARTIST'S DREAM. posture. iter face was buried in her hands, and her long hair covered her slight form like a veil. Arthur in- quired of Madge, who was standing near him, if it was a fancy picture. "C No," she replied, " it is my sister Eugenie. She had never seen a likeness taken of any one, and when we took her to the photograph gallery, she fell upon her knees, as she alwas does, when frightened. . The artist was so delighted with the attitude, that he took her like- ness forthwith." "I see you have a pretty dog here," said Arthur, look- ing at another photograph. "That is my Italian grey- hound-the most graceful little creature in the world. By holding a piece of sponge cake before him, as a bribe, I induced him to sit upon a cushion long enough to serve the photographist's purpose. Here is my horse Buce- phalus," she added, turning the leaf. "Is he not superb?" "He is indeed a splendid animal," returned Arthur, but, I notice, he is without his rider." "Oh, she would spoil the effect," said Madge, modest- ly. Arthur thought not, as he looked at her graceful figure, her beautiful features, and expressive countenance. She accepted his invitation to promenade in the hall, which was more pleasant than the crowded rooms. As they passed out, Arthur noticed that the wreath of white roses (the gift of Eugenie and Dick,) occupied a promi- nent place, among the presents. It was placed in a rich cut glass dish filled with water. Hany of the wedding offerings might be more valuable, but not more beautiful tha t olse simple flowers.   THE ARTIST'S DERY.      ta "How beautiful!" exclaimed Arthur, stopping before a portrait of Charlotte Corday. It seems to live, to breathe, and the- smile is almost divine. That -must have- been thesmile with which she went to her execution." "Papa calls her the lovely enthusiast," said Madge, "What do you think of her crime?" asked Arthur.- "It was dreadful." "'But did she not rid France of a cruel monster-?" he questioned, anxious to draw her out. "And was not the deed a fortunate one for Marat himself? His folly and madness would no longer have been tolerated by the party who were concentrating themselves to form a new government; and the blow came just in time to make him a martyr, and a saint. It not only gave the Jaco- bins an opportunity of making an. imposing funeral dis- play, and of exciting the passions of the people, but it afforded the only pretext that was wanting, to send the detained deputies to the guillotine." "That is all very true," returned Madge; "but I can " {(.  not think Charlotte Corday justified in committing the murder." "You are right!" exclaimedArthur, earnestly. "' Ven- geance is mine, I will repay,' saith the Lord God." "I have sometimes wondered that Marat should have been the chosen victim. Robespierre and Danton were equally conspicuous, and if possible more obnoxious." "Robespierre!" ejaculated Arthur. "Why, he was the most honest man the Revolution ever produced." "Honest!" repeated his companion. \        .         *   &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC8157-00000077"/> 158       THE ARTIST'S DREBAM. "Yes; he was not worth a sou, when he died," said Arthur, with much gravity. "Honest seems to have been a cant word, in ancient, as well as in modern times," said Madge, with a hearty laugh. "Marat was more dreaded by the provinces, than either Danton or Robespierre," said Arthur, " and there was another reason why he should have been selected as the victim. He had, several years before, instigated the death of Belzunce, a young officer, to whom Charlotte Corday is said to have been attached." "Sister Madge has been drawing her!" exclaimed the little empress, pointing to the portrait. "Will you not let me see the drawing?" said Arthur, turning to Madge.         ! "It is only a sketch of the head in crayon," she re- plied. It was produced, and Arthur examined it attentively. "Will you permit me to point out one or two defects?" "Certainly. I would be glad to have you criticise it." He did not spare her. With all the frankness and kindness of an elder brother, he spoke of the faults. He saw that she possessed some talent, and wished to direct it rightly. He gave her much useful information, and spoke with keen appreciation of the beauties of Art. When he had ceased, she asked his opinion concerning a frame for the sketch. "I had thought of a black walnut one," she said. "It would be very suitable, but I do not think you   THE ARTIST'S  DREAM      159 would be satisfied without a passe-partout. That would give it the necessary finish. Do you paint?" "A little. I will show you a landscape in oil, which I completed a few days ago." While she went in search of it, Captain Ryland ap- proached, and laid his hand on Arthur's shoulder. "Is it possible you intend to devote the evening to that child?" he said. "There is a good deal of beauty here. Miss Atkinson is particularly handsome-the lady in straw-colored silk, with full voluptuous lips, and large almond-shaped eyes, which seem to have concentrated the. rays of the sun. Their glances will soon magnetize you." Arthur looked at the lady in question. "Her dress is very decolletee," continued the Captain, "partially revealing the most exquisite bust I ever saw. Come with me, and be introduced.. Perhaps she will recline her head as affectionately on your shoulder, in the dance, as she did on mine, a little while ago." Madge reappeared. "What a fine old tree you have here!" said Arthur, taking her picture, and placing it in a good light. "Did you sketch it from nature?" "Yes, it is a favorite elm, which stands near our house." "You have made free use of umber on the trunk, I see. This is a lovely little oriole sitting on its hanging nest. I have a special admiration for fine trees.

It was beautiful, with its pinnated leaves, and bunches of red berries, which looked like so many rubies. Your sky," he added, turning again to the painting, is quite brilliant with lake." "It was at first so cold with ultramarine, and white fleecy clouds, that I thought it best to give it some warmer tints." "The cascade is very pretty," said Arthur. "The natural one is exceedingly so. How often have I seen rainbows in it, as beautiful hs those in the heavens." , Artificial rainbows are easily made, I believe. I have heard- that colored bows are sometimes formed on the grass, by the refraction of the sun's rays in the morning dew."  "I suppose, like artists generally, you consider water an essential element in a landscape?" "Yes, I do not: think any scenery complete without it;." "There is the loveliest little brook on our place," said Madge, " situated in the most sequestered spot imagin- able. It leaps, and runs, and sings in its hidden nook, secret as the nest of Robin Redbreast.' In the sunlight, it looks like a great diamond, in an emerald setting. I wish so much you would go with me some day to see "I will do so with the greatest pleasure," he replied, and could but think that every one, even the sneering, satirical Captain, must be refreshed by her native ingenu- outness.

"Which "of the seasons do you like best?" "I hardly know. Whether the Spring, when   the spirit of life breathes on the woods, and the saprises to the branches, and the wild flowers seem almost to spring under the feet-or Summer, when one can recline on verdant slopes and listen to the bubbling of waters and the whispering of the trees, and when the wild bird flings back its song from the neighboring boughs--or the gorgeous Autumn days-or Winter, when the ice-king wields his sceptre; I believe, however, I must-give the preference to the latter. Sleigh-riding and ska ting are so delightful; and it is so pleasant to sit by a glowing fire, during the long evenings, and crack walnuts and hickory nuts! You must have splendid skating at Cen- tral Park." "It is very fine.  There are often many thousands on the ice at the same time'." "I should so like to go there I! I presume the parks in the city are very inferior to it?" "Yes; but they answer the purpose for which they were designed. One can breathe freely in them.

"That question I can best answer in the sweet words of Coleridge: Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee- Whether the summer clothe the genial earth With greenness, or the redbreast sit and sing Betwixt the turfs of snow in the bare branch Of mossy apple-tree, while the night-thatch Smokes inthe sun-thaw ;--whether the eave-drops fall, Heard only in the truces of the blast: Or if the secret ministry of frost Shall hang them up in silent icicles. Quietly shining to the quiet moon.'X "Do you spend much of your time in drawing?" "No; they tell me at home, that I cannot stay still long enough.  I am particularly fond of active pursuits; though I suppose I ought to read a good deal now, as I am not going to school. It is not well to read novels, is it, Mr. Lee?" "Not at your age," he replied.  "If you read fiction, it should be well selected."  Will you mark out a course of reading for me, before you return to New York?" "Will :you permit me to do so?" he said, surprised, though evidently pleased at the question.   THE ARTIST'S DREA         163 Their pleasant tete-a-t6te was broken up by Mrs. Cav-' endish, who wished to introduce Arthur to some of her guests; and'he was forced to play the agreeable to ladies, whose remarks were cut and dried, and whose acts aard gestures were smoothed down, to accord with the pol- ished usages of society. He grew weary, and would gladly have turned to the wild child of nature. ' As usual, everybody fell in love with Percy's voice. Ellersley heard some one say that it-was music itself; and , he thought that few ladies would be able to resist-nts pleadings. He was much disappointed at Marion's ab- sence. Augusta had been, tirting with him, and he resolved to make her useful  to himself in turn. It seemed to him, that she could not be Percy Seymour's choice. Like many other people, he often jumped at conclusions, which indeed sometimes, serves instead of sober reasoning. With assumed indifference, he made a diplomatic plunge. "How is the fair fiancee this evening?" Not understanding the drift of the question, Augusta readily played into his hands. "She is better, thank you. I believe your father is now quite sanguine as to her recovery." That was enough. Ellersley  asked, with his usual vivacity, if she were pretty. "Very. She isther pale, if you admire that style. There-is a general appearance of whiteness and delicacy about he&amp;, which I think very attractive." "I had hoped to see Miss Lee here, to-night," he said, after a pause.  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC8157-00000080"/> 164       THE ARTIST'S DRBTf. "She concluded to remain with Miss Marshall, whom we never leave entirely alone,", replied Augusta. "Will you let me have your telescope a while, El- lersley?" asked Harry. "You will not want it this eve- ningo. "Do you devote your evenings to star-gazing, Mr. Cavendish?" "I spend much of my time in the observatory," he re- plied. "Do you not like the study of astronomy?" "I know very little about- it. Is it so very interest-  ing?" "Intensely so," he said, with great animation. "Think of the stars coming in the stillness and darkness of night, and their annual revolution in the heavens. It is) a pleasant thought, that at the same time with ourselves, they may be seen by our friends, in different parts of the world. They were seen by those who lived before us; and they will be seen by those who are to succeed us. They are, as it were, an enduring bond of friendship. Earthly things will pass away, but they will last forever. In their contemplation, we sometimes fancy them beau- tiful windows, through which we can look into heaven itself, Then comes the thought, Are they indeed worlds, inha bited by beings like ourselves? or are they fixed orbs shedding light and splendor? Astronomy is a subject worthy of the loftiest mind. It elevates moral senti- ment and religious feeling. It is at once noble, beauti- ful and grand. Oh glorious, oh celestial science!"

He up. set a pyramid of silver cake, and in his efforts to escape from the confusion he had created, his forepaws were lodged in a dish of charlotte russe; while the rear ones, in conjunction with his tail, threw over a large bowl of cream, the contents of which whre poured on the un- lucky animal. He seemed as much confounded as his betters, at what had occurred; and at the words, "Down Leaper," from   Harry, he jumped on the floor, and walked, with downcast eyes. out of the room, tracking the carpet as he went. i That's papa's dog Leaper," said Dick, by way of ex- planation to a lady, who was standing near him.. "He makes the most wonderful leaps you ever saw;" (an as- sertion she could readily believe, after such ocular dem- onstration.)  "No doubt, he heard the noise, and fol- lowed the servants in the house, and the sight of those high pyramids excited his ambition." After supper, Percy asked Eugenie, with much gravity, if he should have the honor of dancing with her majesty? She declined, confessing  herself sleepy, and not very well. "I was vaccinated the other day," she said, ( and have felt badly ever since. Papa  vaccinates a great many people, but he  don't have such a time as Dr. Jenner did." .

Tables, sofas, and chairs, adorned it, and the carpet was bright and pretty. There were little shades to the windows, and muslin curtains were suspended from the gilded cornices. The walls were hung with tiny pictures in neat gilt frames of the "Babes in the Wood " and "Little Bed Riding-hood." In one corner was a French bedstead. The covering was of snowy whiteness; and the pillow slips were beautifully embroidered with a vine around the edges, and centre pieces of grapes and leaves.

"Yes," returned Eugenie, hastily putting away her broken treasures, and feeling mortified that he should have seen them. "Good-night dollies, good-night sir," she said, turning to Percy. "I am going to bed now." When she reached the nursery door she stumbled over a pet cat which had fallen asleep there. Poor pussy, I did not mean to hurt you!" she said, stroking its back until it purred with joy. It followed her into the room, and stationed itself in front of the grate. "I have been waiting ever so long to put you to bed, Miss Eugenie," said Frances; "how  sleepy and tired you must be!" She undressed her, and confined the beautiful golden hair under a cap. "Now sit there while I take off your shoes and stockings," she continued, placing a chair by the fire. She removed the pretty little boots, unbuckled the garters, and had partially drawn off one stocking, when there was a knock at the door. She rose instantly- and opened it; and pussy, who had watched her opera- tions very demurely, took the toe of the stocking be- tween his teeth, and drew it entirely off.

Now for some fun! thought the Captain. He approached 'her hur- riedly, and whispered a few words in her ear, while Arthur went to meet Ellersley Cavendish, who was rid- ing towards the house. In a few minutes they entered the porch and passed on to the parlor, without noticing the fortune-teller. She followed, however, telling Ellers- ley that she had good news for him about a certain lady, with eyes as black as jet, and whose complexion was a blending of the lily and the rose. Arthur dispatched a servant for the ladies, who soon made their appear- oance. "The madame's fortune is told,' said the woman, bow- ing to Mrs. St. Clair. Then turning to Marion and Au- Sgusta, she told them things which made them look at her in surprise. After telling some very flattering for- - tunes, she opened the door as if to depart; but turned back and shuffled her cards. "Are there not other ladies in the- house who would like their fortunes told?" she asked. "Perhaps she would amuse Eleanor," said Augusta to Mrs. St. Clair. "I will go and tell her she is here." The fortune-tel- ler, afraid of being refused, admittance, quickly followed.

She will be sure to ask for you. She inquired particilarly after your welfare the night of the silver wedding, and expressed: a great desire to see you. But I must go to the parlor."   After greeting Mrs. Rossiur, she seated herself by Carion, exclaiming, "Such a fortune as Eleanor. had ! I wish you could have heard it.'" "Good or bad?" asked the Captain. " Good, of course." "It is wonderful, how correctly thatgrant guesses," he said; "She told me of things that I thought no one knew but myself." " I haven't a doubt of it," said Marion, with a meaning look.  "What's all that you are talking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Rossitur, from the opposite side of the room. " A fortune-teller, did you say?" " Yes, one left here only a few moments since." " Oh, I wish I had dropped in a little earlier (Ellersby heartily wished that she had not dropped in at all). Do tell me everything she said, now do." When Mrs. Ros- situr was ushered into- Eleanor's presence, she over-&lt; whelmed her with a torrent of questions. "How are you, my dear? I am charmed to see you.

"As I approached the -house, I felt some doubt as to whether I should find you alive. What quack panacea has been recommended, or &amp;did she go farther,. and thrust it down your throat?

The three-year old baby was marching from room to room, beating a drum, and blowing a trumpet; acting the part of "Noisy Cecilia," in "Truelove's Tales." Her poor mother was on the couch, suffering with a violent headache. Keturah bathed her temples with cologne, while her maid ran for the harts- horn. Madge Wildfire was at the piano, practicing her last new piece. It was in C major, and very difficult for her; for though Madge had taken lessons since she was six years old, she had not progressed as she should have done. Mrs. Cavendish had her children taught music early, as their fingers were then more pliable. The time spent on music was a time of drudgery to Madge.   In truth, she liked Bucephalus much better than she did, her piano. All the notes, treble and bass, the scales,' sharps and flats were secretly anathematized. Florence, a little moon-faced girl of seven years, (who had spent much of her short life with her grandparents, with whom she was an especial favorite,) was playing on the jewsharp, stopping occasionally to bang on the bass keys of the piano, to the great discomfiture of Madge. Not until the previous night, had Florence been convinced of the propriety of sleeping in caps.

"Sixpence to ride!" cried Harry.  "Hop up, Eugenie." I Bound and round they whirled, apparently as much delighted, as if mounted on some spirited steed. "How absurd it seems!"' said Augusta;) "and yet I remember once riding on a wooden horse at Cape May, and liking the amusement better than any bther on the island." After some sport with Madge at the post-office, Ar- thur asked Augusta if she would go to one: of the con- fectionery tables, and have some cream. "I will take something more substantial, if you please," she said. "I admit to belonging to a racM of beings, which cannot subsist on airy nothings." / "Fowls, game, or what would you liked: There are oysters, though I am almost afraid to recomrimend them; as it is rather late in the season, and they were brought from Baltimore."                          . .

"Probably not. But such as are left over, will be dis- posed of at auction, either this evening, or to-morrow.  I understand the managers expect the profits to be quite large." The last sight Percy had of the little girl, that growed herself, she was seated in an impromptu swing, being sent to the tops of the trees with her doll in her lap,  while a group of children laughed and shouted below. Percy soon joined his friends, and found them prepar- ing to leave the groeUds. He was rather surprised, as it was not very late, but felt glad to go. Clouds had been gathering in the sky, for an hour or two; and they were no sooner seated in the conveyances, when down came the rain.

This was not the first time she had interrupted their conversations; and it would have  been quite provolking had she nLot appeared so uncon- scious of having done anything amiss.

I told him to tell his father of my dream, and-that I considered it a very bad sign. By the bye, I should think the doctor would have enough to do to  keep those wild children of his in order.

I brought some things which I intended to give you, Nellie, in case my dream did not come true.

"And this," she continued, hold- ing a bird's nest before Eleanor, "this I made with my own hands, and a world of trouble it was." "I am very much obliged to you," said Eleanor, with- out appearing to notice her rudeness. "How pretty it isl" "It ought to be pretty. The nest is composed of strips of preserved lemon peeling, cemented with calf's feet jelly. The eggs are made of blanc mange. How very happy you both look, to-day," she -exclaimed, turn- ing to Percy. I am supremely happy, madam," he re- plied, with a slight curl of the lip. Mrs. Rossitur left soon afterwards, and told a number of persons, in confi- dence, that she was grieved to say, she had seen Mr. Seymour very much intoxicated-though she afterwards confessed she did not mean with wine, but with love. "What an amount of assurance some people have," re- marked Percy, as hi resumed the seat by Eleanor, which he occupied on Mrs. Rossitur's entrance. "She always makes me think of a torrent." "She is a kind-hearted person,-I think," said Eleanor. "Ah, I see the bird's-nest aiid the cordial have won you over.

He talked again of their love, and revelled in the gush of its sweet waters. "Shall I read to you?" he said at length, taking Col- eridge's works from the table.   "Will you  be the "Ancient Mariner?"        -  "No, I  thank you.- It is too weird-like to suit my mood to-day."  "Here is a volume of miscellaneous poetry.  Will ou listen to Herbert's 'Pearl?'

Perhaps its greatest charm consists in its truthfulness to nature. With the joyful anticipations of a higher and purer existence is mingled the painful dread of death. But here comes your doctor," he said, looking out of the window, " which means that I must go."' He passed from the room, and in a few minutes Dr. Cavendish entered it. He apologizea for not coming sooner; and was evidently a little out of sorts, as the saying is. The small ills of life had generally 'no power to disturb his equanimity. He had a very happy disposition, and possessed that graceful spirit, which "can, from the wisest, win their best resolves."  But hu- man nature is the same the world over, and certainly too much must not be expected of the medical fraternity. "I am heartily sick of the practice of medicine," began . the doctor. "I scarcely get time th breathe. Yesterday, I went to church-the first time for several months. The discourse was very ably handled. The speaker seemed to combine the gentle wisdom and charity of Fenelon, with the deep spirituality of Neander. I never felt more interested in a sermon; but of course I was not allowed to hear the end of it.' I was sent for in great haste, to see a sick child. Away I went through mud and mire, fearing I should see it in the agonies of death. When I arrived at the house, I found the in- fant was teething, and suffering with its gum, which re- quired lancing.

"No doubt it is very trying to be so constantly with the sick,"' remarked Eleanor, not knowing exactly what to say.  "I suppose, too, that people imagine themselves worse than they really are." 'I have not found it so generally," he replied. "In- deed, with regard to some patients, I may say with Blackmore, that it is wonderful to observe how inappre- hensive they are of their disease. I think many persons are more easily alarmed for their friends, than for them- selves. I intended coming here in the afternoon, but on reaching home, my little girl Florence needed my attention. She had been complaining for several days, and yester- day at noon fever came on. I spent the night at her bedside." "Florence! what a beautiful name," said Eleanor. "1 My wife called her for Biss Nightingale, whose char- 'acter she greatly admires." "It must be very pleasant to reflect that one has done so much good in the world. What a beautiful incident it was, when the sick soldiers in the hospitals at Scutari, unable to sleep through pain, blessed her shadow, as it fell on their pillows in the night-vigils. I should think that alone would have compensated Miss Nightingale for her labors" "No doubt it did," replied the doctor. "Hers was a -noble work." "I suppose few ladies have been of so much service to their fellow beings," said Eleanor. c A woman's sphere is so limited."  "That it is limited, in one sense, I grant you. A   THE mATIST'S DREAM.       2" lady's proper sphere, is usually her own home--her life is a calm current of domestic -duties and charities. The faithful performance of these constitute, I think, her greatest charm. Home is the axis, on which revolve the, habits and principles which control life. The child there receives impressions, which go with it through maturer years. I -would wish, if possible, never to re- move my children, especially my boys, from the influence of their*mother. What would men be without the softer sex? 'The gentle bevy that adorns the world."'  A beautiful tribute to his wife; which, could she have heard, would have repaid her for many a heart-trial. "As you are going away so soon, liss Eleanor," he said, " suppose you take a walk with me on the gallery." "I have been out there several times," she replied, "but I will go again with pleasure." She took his arm, and  they promenaded slowly up  and down the long gallery. Eleanor greatly enjoyed the fresh air, and the exercise did her good.  She soon proposed a stroll around the grounds. .

"And I will have to admit, that many parts of my own country are also very poor." "You are getting on famously," exclaimed the doctor, greatly pleased. "You will walk equal to Ariosto after a while," he added, laughing. "Was he a good pedestrian?" "Excellent. It is related of him, that he once walked from Carpi to Ferrara; and in his slippers at that. It was done in a fit of absent-mindedness,-he happening to-stroll in that direction." "At least, I should not care to imitate him in that par- ticular," said Eleanor. "Are you very weary?" asked the doctor, when they entered the house.    ' "Yes, and no." "Now you, are speaking paradoxically, and must not -expect me to understand you." "I mean," she said in explanation," that I am tired; but not half as much so as I expected I would be." No doubt the doctor felt all the interest that he ex- pressed in Eleanor. It is easy to excite the interest of a physician, if the patient improves; but if not, then is his sincerity put to a severe test indeed. Doctor Cavendish was very weary; perhaps more so than his fair patient. He had not slept for four-and- twenty hours. But he did not make that an excuse to lie upon the sofa, and assume the air of one who must snatch every moment of rest, to enable him to minister to the united world, which without his services would 1'  '   WHE8 AfiThy,S DRUEAM.      2 die a premature death. Neither did he tilt back his chair, fold his arms over his head, and stretch his lower extremities to their full length.

Young Cavendish has gotten it up; and I expect expressly for our benefit. However uncon- genial it may be to us, I think we should accept the in- vitation. It is really very kiid of that famJly to pay us the attention they do. We have no right to expect it." "Of course not. There is nothing more to say. We ill go. I suppose you have seen Aunt Maria and Au- gnsta?" -"Yes, and they have consented to join the party." Augusta was very fond of angling, but she offered to remain with Eleanor. The latter declined, however, and would say nothing but "no," even to Percy's entreaties to be allowed. to stay. When  they went to the river, the next morning, they found a party of about a dozen persons, awaiting their arrival. Ellersley hadrods and lines in readiness for them,    "Permit me to bait your hook," he said, taking a minnow from a basket near him, as Marion seated herself by the water's edge. Do you like angling?" "I enjoy it occasionally, if I am successful." "Then you have not the true spirit of an angler. I confess to having a passion for the amusement. On a day like this, I wish, like Izaak Walton, to take my fish- ing rod, and'follow some winding stream." "Do you not wish too for an agreeable book? That is ai important item you have omitted." "No.. I prefer a'companion that can speak'to me." "None can do that more effectually than, a book, Does not a writer's thoughts flow out to his reader, and oftea- times in the most eloquent language? mWhen perusing a book, I feel as if I knew the author.

"I like the clear eyes of my companion -to look into mine," said Ellersley, "I like to note their various changes, their brilliant flashes, and their pensive droopings. Is not this a glorious day?" "It is beautiful; I quite enjoyed the drive here. The breeze was so delightful!" "This is the finest day we have had this spring; which for us is an unusually forward one."

"My father was married before he was my age," said Ellersley. "One would not suppose that he had been married twenty-five years. He is remarkably well-preserved." "He has led a very happy life, and I think that makes a great difference in a person's appearance. His only grief, I believe, has been my mother's delicatehealth.

That gentleman, who was conversing with Keturah, came forward, and was formally introduced to " the New York belle," as Mrs. Rossitur was pleased to call Marion. Mr. Donnelson was a middle-aged man of comely mien and tolerable address. He had come into possession of some wealth, a few years before, and Hiad made an effort to overcome the defects of his early education. He man- aged to scrape up some little knowledge of two of the learned professions, discoursed lengthily on the merits of Blackstone, and on the wonderful beauty of anatomy. He had travelled four or five years in Europe, and in the East., A considerable portion of that time was spent in Germany, and his mind was somewhat tainted by the skepticism -of that country. He had very recently re- turned to his "native wilds," as he termed the Green River country, and wasso full of what he had seen and heard-abroad, that his acquaintances took care not to broach the subject of his travels. He imagined himself of vast importance, in this world of ours, and was a very good Specimen of the moneyed aristoracy of the land. "He will be a fine subject to exercise your conversa- tional powers upon, Miss Lee," said Ellersley, in a-tone loud enough only to be heard by herself.

Marion prepared herself to encounter a silent bore, and thought how disagreeable it would be to have to in- troduce one topic after another, and perhaps receive only monosyllables in reply. Ellersley moved a few yards off, and began talking to   THE ARTIST S DREAM.       228 Sophia Atkinson. Marion naturally spoke of angling, but Mv.

Fortunately, a diversion was created by the arrival of a buggy, in which were seated Harry and the little empress.

"Do not look so reprovingly," said Ellersley, turning to Marion. "I have not forgotten our conversation of the morning; and my lecture was not very long." Some one proposed a walk to' a spring which was not far off. Mrs. Rossitur threw -her shawl under a trbe, saying it was too warm to wear it. ,Arthur offered to take charge of it, but she insisted on leaving it where it was.

The transatlantic gen- tleman asked permission to call upon the ladies at the hotel the following day, and the party seated them- selves in their respective vehicles. 'What fine poultry!" said Arthur, as a hen strutted along the -road, looking with motherly pride on her well-grown chickens. "They are worthy of Hondek- veter's pencil."

As Marion was stepping out of the buggy, Harry Cavendish dashed rapidly by. Percy's horse became frightened, anid started across the road, throwing Marion on the ground. All was confusion; and the occupants of several vehicles sprang out to offer assistance. "Are you hurt?" inquired Ellersley, anxiously. "Not in the least," she replied, rising. "Only a little bruised; that is all." :We must send right away for Dr. Cavendish," ex- claimed Mrs. Rossitur, who -always liked to make as much   THE ARTISTs DRAM.        229 fuss as possible.

And if he were he would never let his patients know it." "It is to be hoped not," said Arthur. "A nervous patient is bad enough, but a nervous physician must be ten times worse.

"Are you not going with us? From all I can learn, a camp meeting is as good as a circus." "I should enjoy neither the one nor the other," said Arthur. In a few minutes the hack was at the door, and he handed in Augusta and his aunt, who drove off, accom- panied by Percy and the Captain. "We are approaching the camp," remarked the latter, as their olfactories were regaled with savory smells. "Surely people do not have cooking at a -religious meeting!"

When the sermon was ended, and a hymn, "Canaan, bright   THE ARTIST'S DrEAw.      233 Canaan," sung, quite a number pressed forward to the anxious seat. "Amen!" said a gentleman, in a weak treble. "Amen 1" said- another in a deep bass. "Amen I amen!" was heard on every side. "Good morning, ladies," said Mr. Donnelson. "I hope you have been much edified by the eloquent discourse, to which you have been such attentive auditors." "You have not, I know," replied Augusta, "for you have done nothing but cough for the last half hour.' "Yes, I am afraid I annoyed every one around me. I could not well make make my way through the crowd, or I should have retired to another part of the grounds. A  cold is the greatest infliction that can be sent on any one; a stupor of body and mind, 'a whoreson lethargy,' an utter abomination." - "What a catalogue of horrible epithets!

A clergyman clings to his velvet cUshion with either hand, keeps his eye riveted on his book, speaks of the ecstasies of joy and fear with a voice and a face which indicates neither, and pinions his body and soul into the same attitude of limb and thought, for fear of being thought theatrical and affected. The most intrepid veteran of us all dares no more than wipe his face with his cambric sudarium; if by mischance his hand slip from its orthodox gripe of the velvet, he draws it back as from liquid brimstone, and atones for the inde- corumm by fresh inflexibility and more rigorous sameness. Is it wonder, then, that every semi-delirious sectary, who pours forth his animated nonsense with the genuine look and voice of passion, should gesticulate away the congre- gation of the most profound and learned divine of the established church, and in two Sundays preach him bare to the very sexton? Why are we natural everywhere. but in the pulpit? No man expresses warm and ani- mated feelings anywhere else, with his mouth only, but with his whole body; he articulates with every limb, and talks from head to foot with a thousand voices. Why this holoplexia on sacred occasions only? Why call in the aid of paralysis to piety? Is sin to be taken from men, as Eve was from Adam, by casting them into a deep slumber? Or from what possible perversion of common sense are we all to look like field preachers in Zembla, 'holy lumps of ice, numbed into quiescence and stagna- tion and mumbling.'"

"I am delighted to see you!" she reiterated. "People have to take care of number one, in such a place as this." After describing her depression of the morning, and her subsequent exalted state of feeling, she invited them to go to her cottage, as she called it-one among a number of rough rooms, which had been erected for the occasion. After resting there awhile, they were ushered to one of the long tables, which were set in the open air, for refreshment. It was surrounded with people, old-and young; and eating seemed to be the chief object in life-if one might judge by the quantity of .meats prepared in the most approved' styles, breads light as snow-flakes, pastry, syllabubs, and other dainties, which disappeared in a wonderfully short space of time. Augusta observed a gentleman, on the opposite side of the table, looking curiously at a brooch, which confined her collar. He drew to it the attention of the lady who was by his side; and they agreed that it was "a right nice ornament." "That is equal, in its way, to some one in New York calling Bierstadt's "Rocky Mountains,' a' neat picture,'" said Percy, in a low tone to Augusta. The brooch was exquisite-the head of the fabled Circe, in cameo set with pearls. "Perhaps Circe would not deign to prac- tice her art on everybody," continued Percy, with a glance at his opposite neighbors. "It would not be ne-  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC8157-00000117"/> 288      THE 'ARTIST'S DREAM. cessary to fill their ears with wool,' as Ulysses did those of his sailors, when at the Cape, where the Sorceress dwelt."                   I Augusta stepped into a mud-puddle, on her way to the carriage, to the detriment of her pretty gaiters, and new spring silk. "Too bad!" she exclaimed, "my best dress, too. As to my gaiters, they are the only respectable ones I have left. I have nearly walked myself shoeless. If I get into any more puddles, I will have to keep still; which will be a cross to me, unless Mr. Seymour will give me a pair of his boots." "They are at your service," he replied, laughing; "but I fear you will be lost in them." "Possibly!" she said, looking at his small well-fitting boots. "If I ever step into them, I will make a des- perate effort to fancy myself 'Hop o' my Thumb,' in the seven-league boots." "It would not require a great stretch of imagination," he returned. "Well! I suppose it will become me to make the best of my misfortune," exclaimed Augusta, as she sprang into the carriage.   -THE ARTISTES DRF:AM.       23g CHAP'TEij X  .X Vi. "Alas for poor humanity, Its weakness, and its vanity, Its sorrow, and insanity, Alas!" i XT was the last day of their stay at the Cave. All were glad, more especially Mrs. St. Clair, whose face wore a brighter expression than it had done for many weeks. The visit to Washington, from which she had anticipated so much pleasure, had to be aban- doned, however. In the afternoon, Marion and Augusta, accompanied by Captain Ryland and Arthur, started on a farewell ramble. Urs. St. Clair, who never liked to walk, remained with Eleanor and Percy.  Eleanor sat by one of the parlor windows, enjoying the bright sun- shine. Her dress of blue cashmere contrasted well with her fair complexion and auburn hair. While the walking party were admiring a little water- fall, which came dashing down a hill, like a child at play, they met Mrs. Rossitur, who was on her way to the hotel to bid them good-bye. That noted match-maker, always on the qui vive for gossip, seeing Augusta and Arthur in earnest conversation, followed at a  little distance by Marion and the Captain, hastily concluded there was a prospect of another pair of -turtle doves. She alighted from her buggy, saying, that she preferred walking with  .  .  it  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC8157-00000118"/> -2HO      GE ATrijzet te T2 IS DIERAMt. them to riding, and ordered the servant to drive on. The conversation of course became general. "What interesting topic were you discussing?" said " Mrs. Rossitur to Arthur. "We were speaking of the instinct of the brute cre- ation, compared with the reason of human beings," he replied. "Oh, was it that?" she said, in a tone of disappoint- ment, which she could not conceal. a Miss Sunmmers was maintaining," continued Arthur, that the lower animals are more powerfully impressed by natural phenomena than man-that their instinct is often of more service to them, than reason is to us. Grant- ing her supposition to be correct, the sympathies, the tender feelings-all that constitute humanity--have been bestowed only on man; for he is destined to a better, a higher existence. To use the eloquent words of an ac- complished .writer: "'I cannot believe that earth is man's abiding place. It can't be that- our life, cast up by the ocean of eternity, is to float a moment upon its waves and sink into nothing- ness. Else why is it that the glorious aspirations, which peep like angels from the temple of our heart, are for- ever wandering about unsatisfied? "'Why is it that the rainbow and clouds come over us with a beauty that is not of earth, and then pass off andcl leave us to muse upon their faded loveliness? "'Why is it that the stars, who hold their festival around the midnight throne, are forever mocking us with their unapproachable glory?

"' (We are born for a higher destiny than that of earth; there is a realm where the rainbow never fades, where the stars will be spread before us like islands that slum- ber on the ocean; and where the beings that pass before us, live in our presence forever. " "Julius Caesar expressed in public, his disbelief in the immortality of the soul," said Captain Ryland. "He belonged to the Epicurean school, you know, and denied all divine mediation in worldly affairs." "And yet, with all his atheism," replied Augusta, "it was not without hesitation that he crossed the Rubicon." "Man is a queer compound," said the Captain. "He is an anomaly, an incongruity."' "tHe  should be something far nobler," said Arthur.'. "Man is capable of comprehending abstract ideas; and it is in abstractions that man grounds not only all philoso- phy, all science, but all that practically improves one generation for the benefit of the next." The conversation afterwards turned on friendship. Marion quoted Emerson's beautiful remark: "A friend is a person with whom I may be sincere, before whom I  may think aloud." "I think just that way!!" exclaimed Mrs. Rossitur, with emphasis. "A friend is a  second self, in whom can be placed every confidence.  There is nothing that one friend ought not to be willing to do for another-ay, even to die, if necessary. In short, a friend is a friend 1" "-       *          .        ..  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC8157-00000119"/> 24j2     RTISr'S    ,DBEAAM. Her sincerity was soon put to the test. A furious mastiff came running towards them, evidently with no peaceable intentions. Mrs. Rossitur forgot her fine speech on friendship, and left her companions in the   i lurch. With a yell that scared an owl from its hiding- place, she turned and climbed a fence, with an agility for which no one would have given her credit. Captain Ryland moved a little in advance, and with one blow of his cane felled the airal to the earth. When assured that it could do no harm, Mrs. Rossitur rejoined her friends, and on reaching the hotel, went simpering into the parlor. "Such an adventure as we have had'." she said.  She then related it, glossing over her inglorious retreat ! as best she could. Marion placed a bunch of snow-drops ! she had gathered, in Eleanor's hair, which was confined by a pearl comb. Mrs. Cavendish's old fashioned car- rige drawnby a pair of fine baysdrove up, with Keturah and Ellersley; whom M s: St. Clair had invited to spend the evening. When .they were presented to Eleanor, Mrs. Rossittr, (who could not imagine, how a stranger could be left unsought, whether sick or well,) ex- claimed. "Is it possible you have not become acquainted in all these weeks?"  "I have not had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Marshall before," said leturah, "but I have often heard my father speak of her."

Sir David Brewster says, 'that the objects of mental con- templation may be seen as distinctly as external objects, and will occupy the same local position in the axis- of vision, as if they had been formed by the agency of light.'"   - "What a splendid opal!" exclaimed Mrs. Rossitur, taking one of Eleanor's hands in hers.

But the opal, "with its heart of prisoned light," was -more pre- cious, for it was the seal of her betrothal. Mrs. Rossitur soon wearied of looking at the rings, and for the want of something to do, opened a book which lay on a table near her.

"What a rhapsody to get into over Shakspeare!" she said, closing the book. "For my part, I could never see any poetryin his works."  , "It is true," replied Marion, "that some of his finest passages are only relieved from prose, by the cadence of the verse; but that, in itself, is so admirable, that it constitutes poetry of the highest order. "Well! I never enjoyed his plays, be they what they may?-poetry or prose." Then you could never have heart Mrs. Butler read them?" "No, I never did. Don't she read like other people?" 'Not exactly," replied Marion, smiling. "To hear her read: Shakslpeare's dramas, is better than seeing them acted on the stage. She possesses the most wonderful power of expression, and flexibility of voice. She takes her hearers into the scenes which she represents. She elhaills their attention, and electrifies them by her magi- cal art." "The last of her, I hope," said the Captain, in a low tone, to Percy, when the sound   of Mrs. Rossitur's -horse's hoofs died away.

"An amused smile passed over Keturah's face, and she. exchanged significant glances'with her brother. It was not the first time they had heard a stranger express surprise, at seeing something better than log cabins, and finding the inhabitants a few degrees above semi-barba- rians. Not another one of the party would have been guilty of such rudeness. But Mrs. St. Clair could say suceh things with a very good grace, and was never weary of boasting of her own Gotham. After tea, Augusta seated herself at the piano, and rat- fled off a brilliant overture. Keturah then played Weber's last waltz, and. several variations of s'Home, sweet Home;". after which she asked Eleanor- if she felt strong enough to sing. "I will sing for you with pleasure," replied Eleanor. "What would you like to hear?" "Play, 'Come haste to the Wedding,'" said a voice from the doorway. There was a general laugh, when the  parrot was seen there with her gay feathers of crimson and green. ,'Come Poll, you veritable sinner," said the Captain, - taig her on his knee; " what trick -will you play next?" Polly showed her displeasure at this speech, by walk- ing to the other end of the room. She climbed the back of Mrs. St. Clair's chair, perched herself on that lady's Shoulder, and almost kissed her. "Go away, you ugly bird!" she cried, in disgust; and Polly forthwith sought refuge underneath the piano.

Eleanor noticed his absence, but was igno- !  raint of the cause. She sang "Comin thro' the Rye; saad afterwards, that exquisite Italian melody, "No, I will sigh no more."     * "'One more song," pleaded Elersley, who stood by Eleanor' side. She had commenced "While this hear its joy revealing," when Percy approached the parlor. Not wishing to interrupt the music by his entrance, he stood outside the door with folded arms, and downcast eyes.

His head was slightly bent for- ward, as if fearing to lose one tone of that voice.. It was, what is so rarely found, a fine contralto.

Eleanor rose from her seat, and Percy entered the room. Their eyes met, and in that look, Rf]ersley Cavendish could have read the secret of their engage- ment. It was the first time Percy had heard her sing, since her illness, and his eyes expressed his pleasure, "Do play the Lancers, for my special benefit, Eleanor," , cried Augusta; after which, Mrs. St. Clair petitioned for "The Seasons."  Eleanor immediately complied, and Percy accompanied her! on the violin.

Eleanor grew very weary before he evening was over. But she felt repaid for the exer- tions she had made, when she had heard Keturah's and Fllrisley's warm thanks for the pleasure she had given them. Ellersley did -not inherit his father's handsome face. His features were too irregular to be strictly beautiful. But his form, which was naturally good, had been per- lfected, by all kinds of athletic exercises. Although tall and strongly built, his hands and feet were not large. No continued muscular exertion had been confined to one- part of the body, to the comparative weakening of the next; but all the members were justly and beautifully -proportioned. He possessed that most desirable 6f all earthly blessings-- health - that wondrous physical ,strength, which brings with -it so much enjoyment, and which one must always admire;-ay, which it seems to me one might almost worship. ",It is excellent To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous To use it like a giant." "I hope we will hear the stage-horn once more. I confess, I think there is a good deal of music im it," ex- claimed Augusta, the next morning, as she walked down the little yard in front of the -hotel, and stood on the wooden platform, waiting her turn to enter the coach.

The road was rough enough, certainly; but peo- ple can afford to be jolted for a few hours, especially if the scenery through which they pass is attrate and their fellow travellers agreeable. The coach stopped as usual, at Indian Cave; and when Augusta and Ma- rion found that no change of costume was necessary, they consented to accompany Arthur and the- Captain underground. They soon returned, and Augusta gave rather a confused account of the ".Pool of Bethesda," the "Secessionist," "Statuette Hall," and other curiosities. "I wanted to bring you a flower of the "Magnolia Grandiflora," Eleanor, she continued, "but not a speci- men of any kind were we allowed to take from the cave."

TRANOR was very glad to be at home again, with her mother. She was to be married in a few God?^  weeks; and Marion had promised to be the first of six bridesmaids. Although she felt gratified, that Eleanor should have selected her from among her nume- rous friends, and glad to be associated with her, in an hour of such absorbing interest, she was tempted to withdraw from her engagement, when she found that she was to stand with Captain Ryland. He was a person with whom she had no congeniality; and she would ne- cessarily be .much in his society. The wedding was very large, and parties followed in quick succession, The most brilliant was given by Augusta. Her mother had been dead for several years; and she dispensed the hos- pitality of her father's house in University Place. There was a proud light in Percy Seymour's eyes, as he entered with his lovely bride. Her complexion was almost trans- parent, in its exceeding delicacy; and her dress was covered with fleecy clouds of white lace. The front of the corsage was adorned with several glittering diamonds;   ,TE AIRTISTnS DEAM      2- and streams of dazzling light-flowed around her neck-and arms.           Ellersley Cavendish entered soon after the bridal party. He had followed Marion to New York, and- lived only in her smiles. She soon wearied of dancing? and accepted his invitation to walk on the verandahs- The rooms were warm, and many persons followed thetr ex- ample. .Ellersley had never seen his companion look more beautiful. . Her dress of white tulle waq every be- coming; and several exquisite japonicas rested like sno wy crystals in her coal black hair. A set of pearls encircled her throat and well-rounded arms. FTlersley looked! at the one which lay in his own, and thought it even more white and beautiful than the clasping pearls. He had resolved to summon sufficient courage to offer his hand in marriage-to knovp his fate before the evening-was over. Persons constantly passed and repassed them; some conversing gaily, others in more subdued voices. Ellersley spoke in a low tone, and bent his head to catch Marion's answer. But no sounmd issued from her lips "Will you not speak to me," he said; "give me one l word of hope? Or may I interpret your silence as my heart wishes?" h "I would fain be your friend," she replied. "Yes, the friend of my bosom, my wife," he pleaded. Her clear eyes met his. "You have misunderstood me," she said. "-I meant a friencd in a different acceptation of the term." "It can never be, much as I appreciate the honor you confer upon me."     &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC8157-00000125"/> 2         IS I ARTMT'S DRVIAM. -Ae-looked at hims in surprise, and remarked that she supposed the truest friends were sometimes made under such circumstances.

The dread of losing. you forever, in- duced me to do so."

"I will go and. endeavor to do what you : once said a man should do under such cirtumstsan-es,- crush the feeling, rise superior to the disappointment." Her face wore a puzzled expression. For a few minutes she could not recall when, or where, she ,.ad :uttered those words. The occurrence of the evening caused her deep regret. She had a sincere regard for Ellersley, and I was sorry to have wounded his feelings. Had she given him encouragement?- was the question she silently asked her own heart. She had not, had the vanity to believe that he cared particularly for her, as no words to that effect had escaped his lips; and she had not stopped-to reflect that his attentions were directedc-almost exlu- sively to herself. Her nature was free from coquetry;' and yet she had by her naive nmanner led hin to think that he might have some interest -in her heart. Why, she thought, because a gentleman is attentive to a lady, should it necessarily follow that his affections are en- gaged? She might be to him only an agreeable compan - ion, and it was time enough to think differently, when he should declare his sentiments. Why couldl there ot be more free, uninterrupted friendship between the sexes? With such- thoughts in her mind, Marion left ESlerley and sought her aunt, whom she found in. oneof thwepnr- lors.

"Why are you not dancing, Mr. Cavendish?" said the host, seeing Rlylersley in the verandah. ': It is too warm to think of dancing, sir," he replied. "I did not -suppose that the weather or anything else would prevent young people from participating in that amusement. Come, let us go to the card-room." After playing one or two games of whist, Ellersley quit. The heat and the brilliant light were intolerable, and he longed for quiet. Before leaving, however, he felt an irresistible desire to see Marion once more. She was still seated on the sofa, and was conversing with the same person. Ellersley went out on the verandah, and let the night air blow on his burning brow. He then stationed himself by the edge of a window, where he could gaze upon Marion unobserved. For a moment he expe- rienced a feeling of jealousy, at seeing her with any one. With all a lover's apprehension, he fancied that every gentleman who approached her, must be as much in love with her as himself. He had entertained some unpleas- ant feeling toward her, for her rejection of his suit, though it was soon over, and he readily acquitted her of any design to trifle aith his feelings. Her usual beam- ing happy expression of countenance was gone, and a pensive shade rested in its place. Did she grieve for   ;          .?HEWE A RTsa DREAM.     7j him?  There was comfort in the thought. She wastoo young to be spoiled by -the world, too noble, too pure, he thought, as he watched the clear light which shone from the depths of her dark eyes. Hefelt -asif he wold be contented with, his lot, if he knew she would never marry. But it was probable her life would be spent in the sweet society of husband and children.,! Poor Ellersley! He would have spared himself that picture, if he could have looked with a prophetic eye into the fu- ture. He entered one of 'the brilliant drawing-rooms, to make his adieus to Augusta. "It is early yet," she said: "I hope you are not ill?" "Not at all, thank you; but I expect to leave early in the morning for the West." He went directly to his room,. on reaching his hotel But the repose he so much needed would not come at his bidding, and he spent the sleepless night-in pacing up and down the apartment. After the bridal parties, there was a lull in the fashion- able world. Arthur took advantage of it to induce his sister to visit the poor, and to interest her in many use- ful works. He felt that in a great measure she was his charge, and like a guardian angel hovered near to pro- tect her from  evil influences. Mrs. St. Clair protested against all this. She was, she said, the best judge of what was suitable for Marion, and considered it very im- proper for her to go into the narrow, unfrequented parts of the city, and to be in contact with low-bred vulgar people.  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC8157-00000127"/> ' 2;E8      TEx ARTIST'S- DBEAM Alas for Marionl While one endeavored to elevate her thoughts and aspirations, the other was equally assi- duus in her efforts to drag her down to the frivolous amusements of the   world.

Mar- tin was much disconcerted when he saw her, and stam- mered an apology, muttering something about beggars. She called to a little boy, who was slowly moving away. "What do you want, Bobbie?" He turned his large  blue eyes, filled with tears, upon her, and said that his mother was very ill, and he thought he would ask Miss Lee if she would go and see her. Marion ran up stairs, threw on a hat and scarf, and in a few minutes was hur- rying down the street, with Bobbie by her side.. Many curious glances were bent upon them. The petted daughter of fortune, her face glowing with kindness and sympathy, and the child of poverty, with his patched  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC8157-00000128"/> 260      THE ARTIST S DREAM. - clothing, no shoes upon his feet, and no covering for his curly head.' When they reached the miserable attic where Bobbie lodged, they found his mother in great dis- tress. Her -features were contracted, and the whole countenance bore evidence of extreme suffering. Marion's experience in sickness was very limited, and it is not surprising that she found herself at a loss what to do for the invalid; but a neighbor came in, and under her directions, she made herself very useful. Not until then, had she noticed or thought of her- dress. The gay. silk, with its trimming of cosily lace, was indeed ill-suited to the time and place, and she regretted that in her haste she had forgotten to change it. The violence of the paroxysms gradually abated, and in a few hours she had the satisfaction of seeing the poor woman free from pain, though in a state of great prostration. With the promise of returning in the morning, she took her departure. After proceeding a few squares, she called a carriage and drove rapidly homewards. It was six o'clock, and feeling too weary and forlorn to appear at the dinner ta- ble, she went directly to her room. Layiing aside her rich attire, she put on a simple dress, and threw herself upon a sofa. But her rest was not of long duration. There was a slight tap at the door, and Mrs. St. Clair unceremoni- ously entered the apartment. Her brow" was dark and lowering, and the storm burst forth in all its fury. She was deeply offended at her niece's conduct, and had never been accustomed to control her high temper. Marion's face flushed with indignation. She darted a   -THE ABTIST S DEtEABM.     21 look of witherinmg scorn at her aunt, and was about to make an angry reply, when she thought of her brother. For his sake, she remained silent. Her generous,-unsel- fish nature could have but little sympathy with the' cold calculating spirit of Mrs. St. Clair. She knew she was thoughtless, but was conscious of having acted from a good motive. Poor Marion! She was beginning to feel that there are thorns, as well as flowers, in the pathway of life.   &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC8157-00000129"/> ,             D CTTAPT'ER, X C APIER XXTX.

The air in the city was warm and oppressive, and many per- sons had already sought cooler quarters in the country. Away to green woods and running brooks! Away to mountain views, and beautiful breezes! Away to the bounding sea, and dashing spray! Away! Away! Bobbie Blanton was a protege of Arthur's. Two years before he had seen him on the street a rag- ged, delicate-looking child, with his only possessions, a hand-organ and a monkey, the inheritance of his father. He turned the crank, while the monkey danced and held out his hat for the pennies. The Artist was struck with the boy's bright intelligent countenance, and iU- quired into his history. He found that his mother was a confirmed invalid, scarcely able to earn, by the needle, a scanty subsistence for herself and her child. He pro- vided many comforts for her, and took Bobbie to the Sunday School. Mrs. Blanton had not recovered from the attack, re- lated in the last chapter; and it was thought that she could not survive the summer, in the city. Arthur had    therefore made arrangements for her to spend several j weeks at a farm-house, a few miles out of town. Tears of gratitude filled the widow's eyes as she told him how glad Bobbie would be; and that it, would seem to her like being well again, to get to the country. Poor Bob- bie! he had never been, out of the close city, and al:he knew of grass and trees, was what he had seen in the parks. Oh! the joy of that visit to the child of toil, undo. the care-worn, anxious mother. Bobbie never wearied of wandering through the green fields,- and listening to the singing of the birds, .,He, sometimes gathered nosegays of wild flowers for his mother, and her wan face lighted up with pleasure as  she received them. He read a chapter in the Bible: to her every day, and they often talked together of a land more beautiful than the country which he so much, admired. "I should like to go there," he said, one day; "but I am a little boy, and cannot be'good enough to live in that beautiful place." "Not so," was the reply. "It was Jesus who said, 'Suffer little children to come unto me;"' and she tried to make him understand how, in baptism, he had been.. made a member of Christ, the child of God, and an in- heritor of the kingdom of heaven. Mrs. St. Clair was anticipating a brinliant season. , few days at Niagara, the month of July at Saratoga, and the remainder of -the summer at her cottage at Newport.

Some of their friends were going the same route, so it was quite a large party thati found themselves, one bright morning, on the deck of a North River packet, admiring the magnificent sce- ar i e  at NA              r ain,  a nd They left Albany the next day in the early train, and arrived at Niagara about twilight. Pleasant rooms were obtained at the Cataract House, and they were soon lulled to sleep by the roar of the Falls. They enjoyed themselves in different ways. Some danced and firted, with scarcely a sight beyond their hotel. To others, these things seemed almost like mockery, in a place which spoke so eloquently to every thoughtful mind, of the might and majesty of God. To Arthur, each hour was fraught with intense enjoy- ment. He generally sketched from the Canada side, as the finest views were commanded there; and he gazed upon the cataract with more intense feelings of awe and wonder, than when he saw it for the first time. The last evening at Niagara, he spent on Goat Island; and his soul was imbued with the solemn grandeur of the scene. The setting sun cast a golden glory on the sheeted foam of the Falls, and when the moon rose, she shed forth her beautiful silvery radiance. Oh, those roaring, rushing waters! Whence came they, and whither were they going? His heart waslifted in silent adoration; for he knew they were made, guided, and ruled, by the same Omnipotent hand that shapes and controls the destinies of men. He went awaycheer- ful and hopeful, girded with new strength for the battle   TE ARTISTS DREMV.,       265. of life. On reaching Saratoga, Mrs. St. Clair's p ty- took possession of the apartments, which had been en- gaged for them at one of the hotels. Marion's- rare beauty and graceful proportions, did not require the aid of dress. In the simple morning costume, or the elaborate ball-room toilette, she looked - equally lovely. She smiled gaily, was always ready for a playful war of words, and entered with apparent -zest into every amusement. Her aunt thought she had never seen her appear to more advantage, and secretly rejoiced at the influence she believed she had gained over her. To the casual observer, she was a light-hearted, joyous- girl; but Arthur detected, amid all her gayety, an under-' current of anxiety. Marion was indeed restless and un- happy; but she did not take time to analyze her feelings.' The "still small voice," was speaking .to her, and she sought to. drown its warnings by plunging more deeply into the vortex of .fashionable life. She looked so pale one day, when driving to the lake, that Arthur asked, with affectionate interest, if she were well. "Quite well," was the reply. How he longed to be alone with her, and at home once more. The season was far advanced, when they arrived at Newport, and belles and beaux were making the most of their butterfly existence. How refreshing it is to breathe the life-giving, air of the sea! It imparts fresh vigor to the frame, and. awakens new emotions in the soul.

Once Marion ventured too far, and would have been lost, had not' a life-boat been plying near. She was conveyed to the cottage, and restoratives applied; but it was long before animation returned. Arthur hastened to his sister in much alarm, but re- ceived the pleasing assurance, from the attending physi- cian, that she would be quite' well in a few days.    .                . -.

Many a pang has been assuaged, and many a heart made lighter by their mninistry of love. Bobbie had been sent to one of the public schools, but was allowed to visit his mother frequently. He became much interested in a little boy and girl at the hospital, who, although incurably diseased, had bright and happy $ faces, and were often seen looking at pretty picture- books, and playing with their toys.

He was always the plain, unaffected, courteous gentle- manly physician-admired by all, and envied by many; for, like other great men, he had not achieved his reputa- ton without brushing away many cobwebs of vanity, and exciting many petty jealousies. He had been the personal friend of Mrs. Lee, and felt deeply for her daughter; who, in the bloom of youth, was debarred from the pleasures of an' active life.

Arthur was with her a great deal, and was untiring in his efforts to divert her mind. He alone, was- admit- ted into the sanctuary of her tinner life. It grieved her to, see the pitying expression of her uncle's face, as he bent tenderly over her; and she strove to appear cheerful in his presence. ' Mrs. St. Clair was kind .after her fashion; but she was too much engrossed in her own amusements, to have much time for anythinu else. She regretted that her niece should be cut off from a- world which she had so much, adorned, and thought her matri- monial prospects sadly blighted; but she was utterly in- capable of entering into her higher. feelings.

"What in the world do you- want to. go to housekeep- ing for?" exclaimed Augusta, who, in a spause of her con- versation with Arthur, had caught Eleanor's remark, "You will have a world of trouble on your hands, I can tell you. I wish papa would break up, and go to board- ing. I would prefer a large hotel, where I could see and hear everything that was going on." "That life would never suit me," was the quiet reply; then she added, in- a lower tone, "I sometimes wish that we could live in the country. The continual round of gay- ety, which a city life involves, is so senseless and weari- some."  There was a tone of sadness in the Sweet voice; and Marion wondered if she, too, were longing for a rest which this world can never give. During the long nights, Marion often heard the car- riages roll by, to some place of gay resort; and remem- bered the time, when she too participated in the same amusements. At such times, she said, mentally, "How little people miss me now! If I were to die, low soon they would cease to regret me!

She smiled her thanks, and said it was very pleasant to be a there. Do you recognize this young lady?" said her unle, going up to her portrait, and glancing from it to the original, as if comparing thetwo. He did not wait for an answer, but made some remark about Arthur's artis- tic skill. Marion looked at the portrait, and its radiant. loveliness could not be concealed, even from herself.

And that passage "of Scripture came into her mind-l-"lavor is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman that feareth the Lord, the shall be praised." Beauty is like music, or painting, or oratory, God's gift; and a most powerful one Marion had found it to be, in the world in which she had moved; She thought the precious gift of talent would be useless in her hum- ble sphere. She did not know how priceless it would be to her, or that even in the obscure life of an invalid, it can be employed for the glory of God. But MaUin soon found the value of a well disciplined mind; andh-ber unsm fishA nature showed itself in all its beauty. She re- solved, that'whatever might be her lot, she would bear it firmly and nobly. For the sake of those so dear to her, ashe would wear a calm and cheerful exterior.. She took her great sorrow, as it were, in her hand. She turned it over and over, viewed it in all its aspects, and received it with that womanly courage, which so often puts to shame man's boasted fortitude. Dr. F  , with all his experience, wondered 'at, and admired her self-control, and patient endurance; and earnestly wished that she possessed a strength greater than her own. Hers would do far more for her than medicine; but it might fail, in the progress of disease, and he knew the strength of the Alrmighty one was unchangeable and everlasting.

Above all, she trusted that God 'Would make him His own cild--"Al that He loves and blesses."  -Bobbie afterwards went to Mrs. St. Clair's; and timidly asked Martin if he could see Miss Lee. But Martia was very civil this time, and showed him up stairs to lIa- rion's room. She received the little boy very kindly, and inquired if he were spending the holidays pleasantly. "Oh, so pleasantly!" he replied; cm y Sunday School teacher says it is everybody's privilegeto throw aside care and trouble at this season; and sing the Angels' song, 'Glory ibe to God on high.'" Opening a box he had brought with him, he took out a cross wrought of evergreen, and presented it to ia- rion, saying he had wanted so much to give her some- thng, and  as he had heard that the Cross was the o          t   TE ARTIST'S DB)  M.       281  emblem of salvation, he had made one for her, in the: hype that she would like it. Would she accept it from him? 'Touched by the child's thoughtfulness, she assured hid it gave her great pleasure to accept it, and that it should be placed where she could see -it from her couch. "It is indeed the emblem of our salvation," she said, "and will ever speali to me in a language more expres- sive than any framed in words." e"Don't you get tired of always being in bed?" asked Bobbie. "Yes, very," replied Marion gently. "Mother does too, sometimes; and she says, she prays. more than ever for strength-and then Patience watches beside her, like a kind, good nurse, and Faith points to a world where people are never sick and weary."' . - - Mation was soothed, and cheered by this saith. The child had unconsciously taught her a lesson. His simple. present was more prized than all her costly-gifts. She never looked at it without remembering -the Saviour's bleeding cross, which had been borne- for her sins; and she hoped that -strength would be given her, to endure her cross on earth, so that, hereafter, she might wear a crown in Heaven. When her uncle expressed a wish that she could be up, and enjoy the Christmas with them a all, she hastened too assure him that she enjoyed it very much where she was. , And she did enjoy it, by e ntering into the feelgi fngof others, and forgetting herself. She had learned that the truest way of being happy'one's self, is by trying to make others so.  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC8157-00000139"/> 1"3w much goe iwith it to the grave Of life's most precious things I Methinks each year dies on a pyre, ,ike the Assyrian kings.

"Oh, yes. It is our old Virginia home; and looks just- as it did when we visited it, five years ago. There is the mill, and the bridge; and the little summer-house, in the garden, where I have so often played. Where did you get this picture?"

From this bright and glowing picture, Marion often turned to one of more subdued coloring., It was a scene in Verona. Juliet was by an open casement, look- ing so transcendently beautiful, that the artist must have seen the vision of an angel, before he created her.

A t' "What was it?" he asked, looking admiringly- into the sweet face, which was radiant with even the memory of that beautiful vision. "I thought I was well again. My m  din was no longer chained by disease, my-perceptions dulled by suffering and depression, but all were clear and active. My cheek had lost its pallor, and was tinged with the hue of health. With a bright step, I roamed over hill and dale, and saw Nature in all her loveliness. Earth spoke to me as' she used to do. I heard her voice in the rustling of the leaves; in the murmuring of the streams, and in the mu- sic of the wild bird's song. Oh, Arthur! 'I sometimes think that even a few short hours of perfect health, would compensate for months of suffering. I am afraid I love this world too well; for even the hope of recovery makes my heart bound with an exulting thrill of joy. Was not my dream beautiful?"   THE AB  ST'S DREA M.      289 "Beautfful  indeed! But life, you know, dear Marion, is something more than a dream. We all have a work to do." "Yes, but still-work is the hardest of all." "I should think so," he said, tenderly; "but perhaps it is the kind intended for you. Some are born to lead an active live, to carry out, wherever they may go, a spirit which shall rouse the energies of souls; who only stand still until they catch the tone of a. master-mind, and then are stimulated to do great deeds. Some can go abroad, and take relief to the poor and the ignorant, and shed joy and gladness in every path of life. And there are some who, from one little spot, exert an influence extending far beyond their vision-more potent than the busy restless activity of those who appear to accom- plish so much more. Such is the influence of a patient, uncomplaining temper, like that of a dear sister I might name. We cannot estimate the value of a single ex- ample I . It is a beautiful truth that they also serve who stand and wait. Others, with less heavy burdens, are shamed into silencing their complaints, when -they wit- ness the cheerful composure of those whose weight of oare might well bow them down. And many are taught to look unto the c"God of all comfort," to sustain them, also, when they see how His faithful ones,are upheld. 'How far a little candle throws its beams!

Your faith has indeed been sorely tried, but I think you must feel that "God doth not willingly afflict or grieve the chil- dren of men. And that He is ever near--' a very present help, in time of trouble.' Dearest is it so? But you look pale and weary. I have talked too long, and must now say good bye. I expect to leave in the early train to-morrow for Boston; and as I have an engagement to- night, I shall probably not see you again." "To Boston! May I ask if Miss Vernon is the cause of your frequent visits there?" "Yes." "I wish I had made her acquaintance last summer, at Saratoga; but I did not know, then, that you were inter- ested in her.. She is very pretty, with refined and ele- gant manners. How long will you be absent?" "Perhaps a week; but if my suit should be unsuccess- ful, I will return immediately." "She cannot refuse you, Arthur, I don't think any one could." "That is a fond sister's thought," he said, playfully, as he left the room. When he   presented himself at Mr. Vernon's, the morning after his arrival in Boston, his heart beat high with hope and fear. In simple, eloquent language he told his love, and awaited with trembling eagerness the reply. Sweet as the tones of an Eolian harp, soft as an angel's whisper, were the words which made her all his own.  *    TEi ARTISTe 3 DRA. h M  Had life in store for either, another hour of such ex- quisite happiness!  The day on which Arthur left Boston, it was intensely cold. The snow was very deep, and the wind whistled with a mournful sound. The passengers in the cars drew their' wrappings more closely around them, and vented their spleen on the weather. The cold, and the wind, and the grumbling of his companions were alike unheeded by Arthur. Tmagination had carried him back to his betrothed. Her head, with its wreath of golden curls, was upon his breast, the soft dove-like eyes looked confidingly into his. Life seemed so beautiful; and he trusted that this precious love would not make him cling too fondly to the things of earth. The shrill whistle an- nounced the arrival of the train in New York, and he hastened to his sister. His quick step and smiling face, told their own story; and Marion entered warmly into his happiness. If any selfish feeling had entered her heart, at the thought of giving her dearest friend and companion to another, it was gone, and she listened with interest to his future plans. "We are to be married in May," Arthur said, "and were it not for your -illness, my cup of happiness would indeed be full. Mary will be a kind, loving sister, and will do more for you than I can." "That could never be," she said affectionately; ("but I have no doubt we will be very happy together."  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC8157-00000144"/> 292        TIE ARTISTi DHUM.

From infancy she had breathed an atmosphere of Christian love. Without it she would have been as a blighted, withered flower-a delicate rose, exposed to the fury of our wintry blasts. And now that she was soon to enter into the holiest of all ties, well was it for her that she had chosen one in whose heart dwelt the pure love of God. She felt that she had found her perfect earthly rest. Marion had Arthur with her more than ever. Her intellectual tastes had not improved during her illness. She often regretted that so much leisure time could not be em- ployed in study and profit.

The boat, for which they had to wait several minutes, arrived, and they were launched on the blue waters of the bay. Marion's pale cheeks flushed with excitement, and her eyes kindled with something of its old lustre, as she looked upon the lovely scene. The little vessels glided like graceful birds over the undulat-  ing waves, with their white sails glistening in the sun; and the shores of Long Island were green and luxurious. When they reached the opposite bank, the coachman drove rapidly, and they were soon lost to city sights and sounds. Now, they saw the country in all its beauty. Pretty gardens, green fields, and woods were before them; and the large trees refreshed them- with their shade. They entered "Greenwood," with its quiet dells, its stately monuments and obelisks rising above the un- conscious sleepers.

Reverently he laid upon it the offering of flowers, which he had brought for that purpose.

Her husband hesitated about leaving Marion, but the latter settled the point, by insisting that he  should accompany her aunt, and   saying that she would not be lonely. The ceremony was to be performed in St. Paul's Church. Mary Vernon looked very lovely, as she walked up the aisle, lea ning on the arm of her father. The white satin dress hung m    delicate folds around the slight form, and the rich lace veil was grace- fully arranged. But it was the look of quiet happiness that attracted every eye; the peaceful, yet serious ex- pression, that showed how much she felt the vows she was about to take upon herself. The solemn and beautiful marriage service of  the Episcopal Church was rendered still more impressive by the deep, full tones of the officiating clergyman. It cost the parents many tears, to part with their only child; but they knew they had given her to one worthy of the precious trust. After the reception, at Mr. Vernon's   TBE ARTIgSTS  AEAM.       80 residence, the bridal party proceeded to New York, where they were to remain two weeks, and then em- bark for Europe. -With a proud and happy -smile, Arthur led his bride into Marion's room. She bent over the couch to embrace her new sister, and thought, as she looked on her face, how little she resembled the brilliant beauty she had seen not a year before. Mrs. St. Clair thought her house had been very dull during Marion's sickness, and that her nephew's marriage would afford her a plausible excuse for giving a fancy ball. Arthur and Mary would have preferred being quiet. Mr. St, Clair expressed his disapprobation in a very decided manner, but Marion begged that no, change should be made in her aunt's arrangements on her ac- count. The invitations were sent out, and notwithstand- ing the party-going season was over., much of the beauty and fashion of New York were present. Before the guests arrived, Mrs. St. Clair went into her niece's room, richly attired, and blaring with jewels. She advised her to keep the doors elosed, to prevent the noise from reaching her ; and her countenance assumed at expres- sion of self-complacency, as she surveyed herself -in a full- length mirror.

"I shall die of curiosity if I don't find out." "To save you from such an unnhappy fate, I will tell you, that she bears the aristocratic name of Smith." "Where is she from? She does not look like a New Yorker." "New York is not worthy of being her place of resi- dence. She belongs to one of the ' F. F. .'s,' " said the Captain, in a tone whose irony was lost on his obtuse companion. "I believe Mr. Lee is from Virginia," she said. "Yes, he is also one of the innumerable multitude." "Do you know Miss Smith?" "No; I have not the honor of her acquaintance." "A little while ago," said Em, " she stood for several minutes so near me, that her wings brushed against my dress. I wonder they were not crushed." "A butterfly should certainly be careful of its wings ; but I am  not surprised that it wished to rest where it could sip so much sweetness," replied Captain Ryland, gallantly. "I believe you always spread a carpet of compliments for the ladies to walk upon," said Miss Jerome. "There comes the bride! How  pretty she is, with her large, liquid eyes I "And her smile, it seems half holy, As if drawn from thoughts more far Than our common jestings are.

I under- stand his sister used to be hiW beau-ideal of beauty; but she is in ill-health, you know, and very much faded." "Then he must admire two very different styles. Mrs. Lee is a madonna-like beauty, and is not tall. Her sister- in-law has black hair and eyes, and is almost regal." "Is it possible!" exclaimed Em; " there is Mr. C--, just entering the room. I shall not dare to speak above my breath fotrthe rest of the evening, much less dance." "And why not?" said Eleanor, who had just joined her. "Because he is so solemn, and gives one the blues. I don't thinkr ministers ought to go to parties." "I can't see why they should not enjoy the innocent pleasures of life as well as other people," was the smil- ing reply. Mr. C  's presence, however, did not appear to have the anicipated effect upon Miss Jerome's spirits; for her voice was pitched to its usual high key, and she danced with evident enjoyment. At three o'clock in the morning, Marion heard the, ladies go into the cloak-room, which was near her cham- ber. She recognized the silvery laugh of Augusta, and heard her telling some one that she would have to sleep half the day, to make up for the dissipation. State-rooms had been engaged on the Persia, and the preparation for the voyage was completed.  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC8157-00000151"/> O6       THE ARtST'S- DREAM. "It makes me feel so sad, to leave New York," said Marion, to her brother, as she cast a last lingering look at the objects around her. "I wonder if I shall ever see mamma's grave again? Arthur, I sometimes fear that I shall die, and be buried in a foreign land." "Do not speak so despondingly, dear sister," he re- plied. "It is thought the change will be of service to you. We must hope for the best, you know, and trust in- od." Mr. St. Clair was much affected at parting with his young relatives, who had become as son and daughter to him; and he felt how desolate his home would be with- out them.  Dr. F  had suggested many things by which the comfort of the invalid was promoted, and himself accompanied her to the steamer. The wharves were thronged with people. Many friends were there to offer their best wishes, for the safe arrival of our party in the Old World, and they waved their last farewells as the noble vessel passed from her moorings. Bobbie Blanton fixed his earnest gaze upon her, until her white sails were lost in the distance, then turned with a sorrowful heart to his lodgings. Marion soon became   sea-sick, and was for several days very ill. In the extremity of suffering, she longed to siik to rest beneath the foaming waves. They had once swept over the loved form of her father. The weather was beautiful during most of the voyage, with lovely moonlights, charming crimson sunsets, and starry skies. Truly "the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork."   ARig Marion was allowed to occupy a sofa in the saloon. When she became better, she looked upon the vast deep, and thought of the treasures it contained-its beautiful coral wreaths-its myriads of precious stones-and the number and variety of the animal life that dwelt in its broad bosom. And she thought, too, of the fantastic air sung by Ariel on the shore of " the Enchanted Island" in the hearing of Ferdinand, who believed his father to have been drowned in the "Tempest." "'Nothing in him that doth fade, But doth suffer a sea-ehange, Into something rich and strange." On the twelfth day they landed on the green shores of England. A fortnight was spent in Liverpool,:for Ma- rion to recruit.- They then went into the country, to enjoy the beautiful scenery-to ' View the ground's most gentle dimplement, As if God's finger touched, but did not press,' In makriing England." Afterwards they visited Paris, and from thence pro- ceeded up the Rhine. "The river nobly foams and flows, The-charm of this enchanted ground, And all its thousand turns disclose Some fresher beauty varying round," They remained some time at Baden-Baden, as Marion seemed to improve, and to enjoy the picturesque scenery.  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC8157-00000152"/> 808       THE ARTIST'S DREAL October found them in Rome, throned on her seven hills. , And the heart ran over, With silent worship of the great of old, The dead, but sceptred sovereigns who still rule, Our spirits from their urns." The voices of her orators no longer sounded from her Forum, and the- triumphant march of her warriors was no longer heard in her street; but she was grand and eloquent, even in her silence. Arthur walked out on the broad Campagna, and thought what she must have been, when she was " mis- tress of the world."

The artist's last look was on this picture--his eyes closed, to open, no'doubt, on a more wonderful transfig- uration. At his funeral, the painting was placed above   THE ARTIST'S DREAM.         309 his coffin; a speaking monument to his glory, and at the sight of it, his friends wept bitterly.

What emotions must throng the mind at being in Italy-the land so filled with historic associations. Arthur's brightest hopes and anticipations had, from boyhood, centred there! He returned one day to his hotel in raptures with Guido's portrait of Beatrice Cenci, which he had seen in the Barbarini Palace. HEe told Marion of " her touching loveliness, her expression of patient suffering, her quivering, half-parted lips, and. tender hazel eyes, her half-turned -head, with its golden- locks escaping from its white drapery," until she smiled at his enthusiasm. She had often heard of this wonder- ful picture, and wished that she, too, could have seen it. fl pitue  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC8157-00000153"/> 381       THE ARTIST'S DRRAM. CTTNPmu XL.

His soul drank in the spiritual loveliness of Murillo's paintings--the matchless tenderness of Cor- reggio's-the glowing beauty of Titian's-and he turned again and again to gaze upon the heavenly creations of Raphael. He toiled by day and by night. Nothing seemed too arduous, so he could win the true reputation of an Artist. He and Mary were now in a home of their own; a pretty villa on the Arno.  It was fitted up with taste and elegance, and sanctified by their love. It was their especial delight to beautify Marion's boudoir. Among the pictures was a portrait of our Saviour, by Raphael. The contour of the face was perfect, and the countenance beamed with love and mercy; the eyes were lifted with supplication to the Most High, to remove the cup from Him: but "not my will, O   Lord, but Thine be done." There was a madonna, with golden hair, and a mouth which, in the language of an Italian poet, looked like a ( crimson shell;" and there was a dying Magdalene,   THE ABTIST'S DREAM.      8" with clasped hands, and eyes meeldy raised to Heaven. A landscape hung above the sofa. It represented a lake, in which several swans were swimnming; while others were lazily resting near the edge, and dipping their bills in the crystal waters. The bank was carpeted with green, and here and there were clusters of flowers, of different hues, btit all graceful and beautiful. A weep- ing willow drooped its branches over a mausoleum, be- side which knelt a young girl. Her auburn hair fell in luxurious ringlets over her fair form. The struggle in her soul was ended. The choice between good and' evil had been made, and the touching serenity of her coun- tenance betokened inward  peace.  Floating in the clouds was an angel, whose face beamed with celestial joy. This picture was the conception of Arthur's genius, and was executed with exquisite taste. It was Marion's favorite, and while looking at it, she had never moth fully realized that " a thing of beauty is a joy forever." One very beautiful painting was descriptive of Babylon. "It was night, and many glittering lamps shone from the mighty domes, and mingled with the clear stars of the Chaldean's azure sky. Proud Belshazzar sat en- throned in his regal hall, surrounded-by adoring slaves. About him were showered, in rich profusion, all the treasures that expand beneath the burning East. He called 'for the sacred vessels used in sacrifice, that they might deck his feast.' They were brought-those holy, vessels, to be used profanely.

The life of the feast was gone; the song was hushed; the wine re- mained untouched; and Belshazzar, the haughty ruler of men, trembled before a shadow.

But a child of other sires was present-one of those captives, 'who hung their harps on the willow trees,' and sat and wept. E His eyes were bright, yet the deep repose of his features told of a soul of loftier stamp than that assigned to earth. He said, '0 king, elate with pride!

The windows opened on a balcony, whose columns were covered with a creeping vine, bearing a flower of gorgeous hue; A small fountain, adorned with a statue of Venus, was so near, that the sound of the water falling into the marble basin, could be distinctly heard. Marion often listened to the exquisite songs sung by Italians, in the soft, melodious accents of their native tongue. Mary's voice was not powerful, but clear and sweet, and when she sung the simple ballads of her own country, Marion thought of the truth of the lines: ' Music hath the-key of memory, And thoughts and visions, buried deep and long, Come at the summons of its sweeness nigh."   TH.  ARTIST'S DREAM.     -   313 Marion was guarded by unceasing love. Her brother and sister watched with intense eagerness, for the lan- guid eyes to become brighter; the weak form to grow stronger, in the delicious climate where the sense of existence alone is pleasure. Arthur described, in such graphic language, the ravishing beauty of this sunny land, that Marion once said to him, that she fancied she could see it all. But he felt, with Wordsworth, "Ah! that such beauty-varying in the light Of living Nature-cannot be portrayed By words, nor by the pencil's silent skill But is the property of those alone Who have beheld it, noted it with care, And in their minds recorded it with love."

He treasures them in the mind, and transfers them     to canvas. He invests the commonest objects in life with interest.    The rocks, the pebbles, and the sea-weed, have their own peculiar charms.

Art is glorious indeed, but it cannot equal nature. Look at the colors on an artist's palette! How bright and rich they are--yet how in- adequate to rival the delicate blush of the rose, or the matchless purity of the lily of the valley. Nature, like a fond mother, leads her children step by step, upholds them with her mighty arm, and reveals to them   the mysteries of the beautiful and sublime. She bids them go forth and revel in her varied charms. She takes them to the forest in the spring, that they may be glad- dened by the sight of the budding trees.

In the autumn, that they may see the ground covered with leaves of rich crimson and gold, and watch them play like merry children, at a game of hide-and-seek.

The artist who studies Nature closely, will find all his enthusiasm excited, his faculties aroused, and his soul filled with gratitude, with reverence, and with fear. He walks, as it were, in a new world. He looks, upon a brighter sky, and breathes a purer and diviner atmos- phere. Nature sets her seal of love upon his brow, and teaches him to humble himself at the shrine of the eternal, the spiritual, and the divine. She is at all times, in all seasons, a delightful companion, a faithful friend, a true, unerring guide. "Nature never did betray The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege, Through all the years of this our life, to lead From joy to joy; for she can so inform The mind that is within us; so impress With quietness and beauty, and so feed With lofty thoughts; that neither evil tongues, Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold Is fall of blessings." ' The enjoyment of many persons is greatly enhanced by imagination-that wondrous gift, so blessed to some, so dangerous to others. "To those who seek for beauty and happiness, it lifts the veil of nature, and discloses all her charms ; unfolds the rosebud to the morning sun, and awakens the lark to sing its matins to the purple dawn. But to those who close their eyes to the loveli- ness that awaits them, it darkens, with a tenfold gloom. :..

Again a harbinger of storms and darkness. It is like a wreath of beauty, shadowing our upward gaze. A crown of thorns, encircling a bleeding brow. It penetrates into unknown paths, gathering riches for the supply of con- fidence and hope; or collects evidence from 'trifles light as air,' and sharpens them into the pangs of envy. It is not a light to be extinguished. Behold that criminal at the gallows foot, when priests and judges have done 'their utmost to fortify his soul for its last struggle! Ask him if imagination does not paint the picture of his cottage in the woods, with her whose prayers he has neglected, fondly watching for his return; and whether the voices of his children come not on the wandering gale, as they lift their innocent hands to heaven, and bless their father, in their evening hymn."  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC8157-00000157"/> CHAPTER  XTiTT. "A wellspring of pleasure. , ONE bright afternoon in March, Arthur brought an infant, wrapped in white muslin, and laid it on Marion's couch, saying: "We have named her for you, dear sister." Marion looked at the tiny being beside her. Arthur's child! How dear it was to her; and she hoped that it would look like him. But it had its mother's deep blue eyes, and light silken -hair. A baby, in a house, is like perpetual sunshine; and little Marion soon made her home resound with her in- fintine prattle. At length she became very mischievous, upsetting her manmma's work-box, taking sly peeps at Aunt Mariohns treasures, and once came running into her room, holding up her hands, crying, "See, see, how red and pretty!"The little elf had been to her father's paints, and dipped her fingers in the beautiful carmine. How strange life seemed in Italy! The out-of-door existence-the soft dreamy languor that stole over the senses-the calm and quiet, so different from the rush and bustle of Anglo-Saxon life. Arthur found it very pleasant; and if Marion's health had improved he would have been very happy in his beautiful Tuscan home. But ahe was weaker than usual, and was deprived of many   THE ARTIST'S DREAS,        319 of her former pleasures. She was dependent on others for readiig, (which had been her greatest solace,) and she strove to guard against the morbid   sensibility which is so often engendered by disease. She felt that her mental powers were not what they had been-a fact which caused her many a secret tear. Experience taught heri the bitter lesson, that the mind could not bear close thinking; that it would surely turn, and make its victim pay the penalty. She was able to see but very few persons, and endeavored  to make her thoughts, (on which she had frequently to rely for companionship,) flow into healthy channels. Those lines of Mrs. Brown- ing were often in her mind- "I lived, with visions for my company Instead of men and women, years ago, And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know A sweeter music than they played to me." Howinexpressibly touching and beautiful is the poetry' of that gifted being, whose genius was developed amid the darkness and seclusion of the sick-chamber! How like a flood of melody it pours over the heart, making it wish that she could have been immortal! How the poetical world was filled with sadness, when she had warbledlher last song, and sighed to think her spirit would return to earth no more I "The mother of the beautiful child " sleeps in peace.

Arthur was now almost constantly at his easel; and his perseverance did not remain unrewarded. Gradually,   THE  ARTIST'S DREAM.      321 he grew into repute. It was discovered that a genius of no common order was rising slowly, but surely, to the "Temple of Fame," to quaff from its glorious foun- tains the rich waters of their Perennial Springs. He was considered as  " a gem of great price," and now ap- peared like the diamond which glistens with redoubled lustre, from having been so long concealed. Marion listened with delight to his praises, and looked upon him with all a sister's pride. He showed her a portrait, which he had just completed, of his wife, seated in an attitude of careless grace, with her child playing at her feet. The figures seemed starting from  the canvas, in their life-like beauty. "Dear Arthur," said Marion, "how often I have re- gretted, that we have no likeness of mamma. It would be of such inestimable value to us. I sometimes try to fancy how she looked. Dear, dear mother!- "Far back, through the dim vista of years, I try to catch a vision of thy lovely face; To gaze upon thy snowy brow, And each dear ineament to trace- To hear once more the low sweet voice That fell like music on my ear, And made my heart rejoice.

Upon one occasion, while Arthur was painting behind a screen in his studio, several visitors entered,   and he heard the following conversation. "How pleasant it is to meet one's countrymen abroad.  I could tell an American at the end of the world. I saw - M. Adair at the Opera last night, and I was so delighted, that I only half enjoyed Salvi's superb singing. I drove with him to the Cascine this morning. He told me the Flints were here, and that their portraits had been taken by r. Lee. I wonder they selected him." The speaker was Miss Jerome; and one of her com- panions replied: "CMr. Lee is a fine artist, and appreciated even in Italy. "Oh, I have no doubt of that; but Mrs. Flint is al- ways so fond of anything foreignI I expect she will purchase any quantity of trashy pictures, and represent them, on her return home, as works of the old masters.

Arthur could scarcely refrainfrom laughing He re- membered the annoyance that both Mr. and Mrs. Flirt had caused him during the sittings. Theywerenotonly void of taste, but had constantly suggested alterations,  evidently regarding him as a mere machine.

As his children, he said, could not come to him, he must go to them. There was also a letter from Bobbie Blan- ton, thalnKrg Arthur for his generous aid, and saying that he was about to begin the study of the ministry. That letter gave Arthur deep pleasure, and he thought that even the fond mother could have had no higher wish for her orphan boy. --   THE GARTIST'S DEAML.       82  CH APTEU "TTV.

He took the little Marion in his arms, and scrutinized- her features, (probably in the hope of seeing some re- semblance to his own Marion,) and remarked that her name made her dearer than ever. 'When he went into his niece's room, and bent over to kiss her, she twined ' her arms around his neck, saying, "Dear, dear uncle, how glad I am to see you " Although Arthur had tried to prepare him for the change in her appearance, he was greatly shocked. The symmetry of her fine form had    . been destroyed by her sedentary life. The features bore  traces of much suffering, and her complexion was dead white. But she was calm and serene. Inadversity, she had learned that most difficult of all lessons-to con- quer the natural weakness of one's own nature.

Who has forgotten these? They are enough to appall the stoutest and bravest; and the feelings of intense anguish- they cause, can be ]known only to Him, who is able to read the secrets of the hu- man heart. He alone can understand the peculiar trials and temptations of those whom, in His mysterious Prov- idence, He has called to pass through the hidden state of sickness. He alone can give them strength. He hath said, "As thy day is, so shall thy strength be." It is a prevalent, and at first sight would seem a very natural idea, that a sick person is exempt from all temptation, and has nothing to do but serve God. It is not so. The temptations are of a different character, it is true, but they are more numerous and important, and the weak- ened body and clouded intellect finds it very difficult to resist them., Those roseate with health and strength, rejoicing in their superabundant vigor, must surely be able to overcome more easily the temptations which be- set their daily paths. In various forms of trial sent for our discipline, how many hearts are tempted to ex- claim: "My cross I cannot bear, Far heavier its weight must surely be Than those of others which I daily see."

She sat on his knee, climbed the back of his chair, pulled his hair, and played all kinds of pranks upon him ;-all of which he bore with perfect good-nature. One day, while searching in his pockets, she found a piece of tobacco, which she trans- ferred to her mouth. She was- unfortunate enough to swallow it, and was for a few hours quite sick. After she recovered, her uncle asked if his little gipsy would have some more tobacco, to which she replied: "No, no, tobacco's hocky;" at the same time making an expressive gesture with her mouth.     . ?

Clair spent most of his time with Marion, and it was an unspeakable comfort to her to have him with her. He thought her character became more like her mother's every day. They sometimes talked of Lilia, and of the joy it would be to meet her in Heaven,. The father's heart had yearned for his child, but as he looked at Marion, and thought of her sad life, he was glad that Lilia had been taken. He had been in Florence six months, when business of importance required his pres- ence in New York. Marion bade him farewell, with cheerful words, but a sorrowful heart. She felt that she would see him no more, until they met in that world, "Where no farewells are spoken, Where hearts that truly love, love on, and are not broken."

CHA-P'fJ EXLV "Thou art lke night, O eickness, deeply stilling Within my heart the world's disturbing sounds, And the dim quiet of my chamber filling With low, sweet voices, by life's tumult drowned." IiE best medical skill in Europe had been em- ployed for Marion. She realized that one of the painful parts of sickness is seeing strange physi- cians :-the alternations of hope and fear excited by their varying opinions.  Her thoughts often wandered over the vast Atlantic, to the physician of her childhood. No one so thoroughly comprehended her temperament as himself; so fully appreciated the struggles and sacrifices she had made.  Certainly there was no one in whom she so much trusted, and she had often thanked him in her heart, for telling her the plain, unvarnished truth. With all his varied learning, Dr. F  was as humble as a little child. He manifested the same interest in Marion's welfare, as when she was within his sphere of action. Amid his arduous duties, he found   time to write her kind and cheering letters, and the regard and fi endship of such a man were very gratifying to her. One morning Arthur gave her a letter from him, which she read  with blinding tears. It was written on the .   o   TH: .RIST'Si DIREAYf  Sixteenth Sunday after Trinity, and had been a long time in reaching her. -In it, he expressed his sorrow that her health had not been improved by her long resi- dence abroad, but hoped that her heart was as brave and cheerful, as in the early days of her sickness. His in- terest in her, he assured her, was far more than svm- pathy for all she endured. He went on to say, "Perhaps this world would be too beautifuli, too alluring, were it not for its heavy trials, its crushed and disappointed hopes. God places His chosen ones in the furnace of affliction, and waits to see' His glorious image displayed in their humility, their patience, and their love.' I know not, my dear Marion, how I can better express all that I would desire for you, than by transferring as my own, for you, St. Paul's prayer for the Corinthians, in the Epistle for to-day. May it be fully realized'in you, as the earnest of a happier lot on earth, and all the great and glorious blessings promised in the life to come." Alas! happier days on earth were not for her, but she trusted that the blessings of the life to come, were in store for her. Where were now, the impassioned hopes, the joyous anticipations of her girlhood? She had learned to give up all. She remembered the time when the thought of dying in a foreign land, had been very painful to her:--now, she was reconciled to it. She felt, that at home, or in a distant clime, "Jesus can make. a dying-bed soft as downy pillows are," and she knew that the love which had smoothed her rough path in life, would beam as a bright halo around her last hours.  &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC8157-00000166"/> 336       THE ARTIST'S DREAME "When I die," F she said to Arthur and Mary, "I would have your voices soothe me, 'Till they mingle with the music Of the angels in the sky"; Brother, sister, kiss me often, When I die;- And my lips will smile in closing, As if clasped in dreams so golden, That I will hot wake to sigh.'"  .

Sfr ALT, I commence this epistle, dear Marion, by saying, as the children do, "I take this oppor- tunity of writng to you?"Neither will I begin by apolo- gaing for former remissness, but simply say that I hope you will be glad to hear from me. Some one has said, that "( a letter is half a meeting," and such I desire this to be. I write more particularly just now to tell you of my marriage, which took place three weeks :ago. Will you wonder who has had the courage to take your rattle- brained quondam friend for a wife? Both the-courtship and the engagement were very short. Indeed, when the important question was put to me, I was so surprised I scarcely knew whether to say yes or no. I twitted him on his former penchant for you; but he told me he had gotten over that before you were- taken ill; so I was forced to be content, and became forthwith, Mrs. Captain Ryland.- The name would once have sounded quite grand to me; but in these days of military titles, it seems very small indeed. The wedding was a perfect squeeze. You know I al- ways said that I would have a blow-out when I married. 15  &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC8157-00000167"/> 888       THE BRTIST'S DRRAM. I was in the hands of the hair-dresser for one mortal hour. My hair wouldn't go right, and after all the pull- ing and twisting, I had to wear it down on my forehead. I did not care about it myself, for I abominate rats and waterfalls; but the Captain was disappointed. His look said plainly, ' something is wrong.' It-is rather tiresome to be always in the fashion. Thinking you may have sufficent feminine curiosity to wish to know something of my dress on the grand occasion, I will mention that I wore a white moire antique, with a shell wreath and Brussels lace veil, which reached almost to my feet. I was not so much taken up with my husband, as to pre- vent my examining some of the elegant toilets. Em. Jerome's was as usual in exquisite taste. A blue silk which might have stood on its own weight, and head dress of roses to match. She returned from Europe several weeks ago.  She is exceedingly pretty and grace- ful, but has a habit of leaning almost in the gentlemen's arms, which I should think would disgust them with the sex.  My presents were beautiful. By the way, I dislike the practice of exhibiting wedding presents. One is in an agony for weeks beforehand, for fear of not havinrg a gooddisplay.' The Captain's gift-a set of diamonds-was quite the handsomest I received. They are indeed mag- nificent, absolutely blazing with light. His mother (of whom I stand in awe) sent me a pair of antique vases. You ought to see her. She is as stately as a duchess, always on her dignity. Perhaps I will become accus- tomed to her in time, and dare to laugh before her. It r   THE ARTIST'S DBEM.  is more than probable that she would have liked some one else for a daughter-in-law. However that cannot be helped, and I will endeavor to be on my p,s and qas. There were hosts of people at the reception, and I cannot fltter myself that any one thought the bride pretty. We went to Washington for a few days. I took my seat in the cars, -and looked indifferently out of- the window. The Captain sauntered in a few minutes afterward, and read the 'Times;' taking no more notice of me, than if I had been in Kamntschatka. That is pleasanter than having everybody staring at and criticising you. Don't you  think so?  Whew! How everything smells of tobacco. The Captain will persist in smoking in my room, (such an abominable practice,) and ever wishes me to keep him company, by using cigarettes. That, I vow, I'll never do. On the whole I believe I am very happy, though- I confess ,to feeling a little hurt this morning, when I heard him, as he went down stairs, humming "O would I were a :boy again!" and the honeymoon not over either. It was really too much. When I told him of it, he only:laughed, and said, "How silly!" But he kissed me afterward, in -a very loverlike fashion, and declared his belief in the .fol- lowing lines of Sidney: "There is no. greater bliss Than is the quiet joy of loving wife; Which whoso wants half of himself doth misse; Friend without change, playfellow without strife,; Food wiiout fillness, counsaile without pride, Is this sweet doubling of our single life" ' / *8   .

She has developed into one of the most lovely Christian and intel- lectual characters, I have ever known. She has created quite a sensation here, and is the acknowledged belle of the season. She is called the "YoungPeri of the West." Her eyes are like the flashing of diamonds. She reminds me of a frightened fawn: Her manners are very easy and natural.

T was a lovely evening in June, when Eleanor ,[bi arrived at her country-seat, on the birnks of the    Hudson. The air was calm    and still, and a quiet dreaminess seemed to pervade aU nature. One might have said: "It is a beauteous evening, calm and free, The holy time is quiet as a nun  Breathless with adoration." The next day was Sunday-- And the Sabbath bell, That over wood, and wild, and mountain dell,  Wanders so far, chasing all thoughts Inholy, With sounds most musical; most melancholy," met Eleanor's ear. She watched the villagers wending their way to the little church, looking so neat and orderly, and contrasted the scene with Goethe's des- cription of a Sunday in Germany. She was always glad to exchange the noise and bustle of the city, for the quiet pleasures of her country home. To her,  &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC8157-00000174"/> '862        TtLE ARTIST'S DREAM. "H igh mountains were a feeling, but the hum Of human cities torture." She preferred the panorama of the Hudson, to the finest work of art, and the fragrance of the hay-fields to Pha- Ion's choicest extract. Her home was among the most beautiful in the High- lands, and she hoped to be happy there, with her books, her music, and her flowers. The house was- of dark stone, partially covered with ivy, from among whose glossy leaves, the beautiful blossoms of the wax plant were seen. The garden was in all its glory. Flowers rich in color and fragrance met the eye at every turn. The roses seemed to vie with one another in beauty. The moss burst blushingly from its green leaves, and the yellow tea wooed the beholder to its side. The white, musk-scented cluster rose, (said to be the celebrated rose of the Persian poets,) regaled all who saw it, with its delicious perfume. Carnations put forth their beautiful blossoms, and the little- Notylia albida exhibited its white flowers, resembling " fairy shells." Eleanor walked out one bright momning, while the dew still glistened on the grass and flowers. She herself looked as fresh '-" as morning roses newly washed with dew." A bird sat- on a beech-tree near her chamber window, with distended throat and quivering wings. It did not, like Browning's wise little English thrush, "Sing each song twice over, Lest you should think he never could recapture The first fine careless rapture 1"   TTHE ABTIST'S DREAM.         . But it revelled in the magnificence of nature, and war- bled its hymn of praise, which sounded to Eleanor like the song Bonnivard's bird did to him- "The sweetest song ear ever heard," A " song that said a thousand things, And seemed to say them all for me!" The bird had built its nest in the same tree for several successive summers, and Eleanor   welcomed it cordially, to her heart and home. Birdling! nestling in the tree, Thou art very dear to me ; Thy plumage is so soft and bright, And thy eye so full of light. The wondrous gift of song Does to thee belong :- Dost thou know that thy sweet lay Has often cheered a weary, day? When our summer roses fade, And thy adieu to us is made- - When thou seek'st a milder clime,  To spend the dreary winter time- When thou bask'st- 'neath sunny skies, Where glorious beauty never dies, Dost thou know, as thou dost roam, That we miss thee in our home,? Soon shall come the lovely spring, And with it warmth and sunshine bring; Then to us thou'lt swiftly fly, We shall see thee, by and bye.  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC8157-00000175"/> e      ilTHE ARTISTS D  ARM.     - Make thy nest withoulffa fear, For no barm is near thee here ; Sweetyv, gently, mayst thou rest, Thou art ever a welcome guest! Eleanor put some pretty white blossoms of the elder in her rich auburn hair, and sat down to rest in a rustic arbor. Myriads of insects, in gay attire, were in the hedges, in the grasses, and in the air. Some looked like beauitiful mosaics, some like regal gems. All were full of enjoyment, and celebrating, in their own way, the festival of life." "'There is the grasshopper, my summer friend,"' thought Eleanor. "' Where'er I gaze-- Ten thousand insects in the air abound, Flitting on glancing wings that yield a summer sound.'" Within the ground, was a miniature lake, in the centre of which was an island covered with Neapolitan violets, royal. with beauty. There was a pretty legend con- nected with this isle of violets; how a fairy held' her revels there, stepping lightly on the purple carpet, which was almost too delicate, even for her dainty little feet. And how, by moonlight, she sailed on the lake, seated in a water-lily, with a jewelled wand in her tiny hand. Chaucer says that the fairies departed from Britain before his time. "In olde dayes of the king Artour, Of which that Bretons speke gret honour, A- was this land ful filled of faerie;   THE ArTST'S DIEAM.           X The elf queene, with her joly compaigne, Danced ful oft in many a grene mede. This was the olde opinion as I rede; I speke of many years ago:  ' But now can no man see now elves mo', For now the grete charitee and prayeres Of limitoures and other holy freeres, That serchen every land and every streme, As thicke as motes in the sonne beme; Blisaing halles, chambres, kitchenes, and boures, Citees and burghes, castles highe, and toures, Thropes and bernes, shepenes and dairies, This maketh that ther ben no faeries; For ther as wont to walken was an elf, Ther walketh now the limitour himself." Fairy mythology is vastly interesting, and one might al- most wish that the queer little people, made so famous by some of the British .poets, could exist. That    obin Goodfellow could play his wild tricks, and scamper-- "Through woods, through lakes-through-bogs through brakes," and visit the farm-house, "To earn his cream-bowl duly set." Indeed, we might even be willing that the household Dobbies should make their habitations-   - "'In corners of old houses least frequented, Or beneath stacks of wood, and these convented, Make fearful noise in butteries and in dairies; Robin Goodfellow some-some call them fairieP; In solitarie rooms these uproares keep, And beate at doores to wake men from their slepe,  &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC8157-00000176"/> i:88t       THE ARTIST'S DREAM.

Pots, glasses, trenchers, dishes, pannes, and kettles, They will make dance about the shelves and settles, As if about the kitchen tost and cast, Yet in the morning nothing found misplac't." Eleanor sometimes clambered up the lofty hills, and sometimes she gathered moss from the old gray rocks. Madge Wildfire should have been transplanted to these precipitous heights. Her redundant health     and her activity would have enabled her to ascend without diffi- culty; and her wild, free nature would have revelled in such scenes.   New prospects opened at every step. The wooded hills, the lovely vales, the lordly river, with its beauteous isles-all "perfect parts of a harmonious whole "-all so beautiful, so grand, that one would not wish "to change one line in all that picture marvellous." Who could look at it Without exclaiming, with Shelley, "Magnificent! How glorious art thou, earth! and if thou be The shadow of some spirit lovelier still, Though evil stain its work, and it should be, Like its creation, weak yet beautiful, I could fall down, and worship that and thee. Even now my heart adoreth. Wonderful!" Or with Byron, "I live not in myself but I become Portion of that around me. . .

But I should think that the lesser trials of life would be lost in its mighty pleasures.              ,    The weather had become very sultry, and, one -day, after feeding some pet pigeons, Eleanor lay down on one of the parlor divans. She looked intently (as she had often done before) at a large painting on the oppo- site wall. Independent ofits merit as a work of art, the subject was one of' unusual interest. It represented the early home of the gallant and accomplished Sir Philip Sidney; and the tree, -which is said to have been planted on his birth-day, occupied a prominent position in the landscape. The beholder could walk in fancy, through the magnificent groves of Penshurst, and live in the olden days of chivalry. The brilliant cavalcade could be seen, with neighing steed, moving to the sound of gay- est music.- Tilts, tournaments, and sports of the ring, where the gallant and successful knight considered the smile of beaiiuty sufficient recompense for every danger. Alas! the glory of those days is gone forever. Eleanor rose, and passed her fingers over the glitter- ing strings of her harp. Strains rose, rich and harmoni- ous, murmuring like the liver breeze, and dying away softly as wave falls on, wave. Again and again they rose, while a solitary female voice melted and mingled with the melody. Several persons were rowing on the water, and watching the sparkling diamond drops, fall-   THE BARTIST'S DREAM.        Q5S  ing in showers at every movement of the oars. As the delicious sounds floated toward them, they neared the shore, and rested their oars. They felt they were listen- ing to no ordinary performer. Who has not felt his heart touched with profound emotion by music?  The spirit seems for awhile to cast off its shackles, and soar upward on the wings of sound, to be enraptured and lost in a dreamy ecstasy. Eleanor thought the river looked even more beautiful when seen by the soft moonlight, than by the dazzling rays of the sun. When looking at it, she sometimes thought of the lines: "To my feet the river glideth Through the shadow, sullen dark! On the stream the white moon rideth, Like a barque. Gentle buds are blooming near me, Shedding sweetest breath around,-' Countless voices rise to cheer me, From the ground;--  Till I think some things there be, In this dreary world that love me, Even me. Now the moon hath floated to me, On the stream I see it sway, Swinging boat-like, as 'twould woo me, Far away.     - And the stars bend from the azure' I could reach them where I lie, And they whisper all the pleasure, Of the sky.  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC8157-00000178"/> 860        THE ARTIST'S DREAM. There they hang and smile above me, Till I thin some things there be, In the very heavens that love me, Even me!" Sunmmer waxed into autumn. Everything within the grounds was pencilled by the frost. The forest trees were in all the pomp of scarlet and orange. The stately   4 beech by Eleanor's window receives '( The sun upon its crowded leaves, Each colored like a topaz gem; And the tall maple wears with them The coronal which Autumn gives. The brief, bright sign of rnu- near, The hectic of a dying year!" The garden was bereft of its most brilliant flowers, (sweet children of the summer sun,) but the asters, the chrysanthemums, and a host of sturdy ones supplied their place. Ahe pretty brown butterflies displayed their velvet wings, and the white transparent veil of the Indian Summer was thrown over hill and dale. As out- door enjoyments lessened, those within doors increased. It was pleasant to draw the curtains in the evening, to wheel the table before the grate, all a-glow with coals, to read from  some favorite author, or engage in some kind of handiwork. But the time had come for Eleanor to return to her winter home.

I thought they    were  always so happy, and   had no need to go in mourning. "They   do  not wear  mourning, my   child.  What put such an idea into your head?" "The angel that comes here so often, always has on a black dress, with a black bonnet, and a long black veil. 'What large, juicy grapes    she brought me this morning, mother!   You   never gave me any like them."   THE ARTIST'S DREAM.        3863 "Those were black Hamburg grapes, Toby, and your mother could never afford to give you such.

"A But mother, when she speaks to me, her voice sounds as if it had come from the skies, so soft and sweet. And she looks just like that angel yonder, (pointing, as he spoke, to a little painting in water-colors, near his bed,) only she hasn't got wings." The picture represented an angel, showering blessings, in the shape/of flowers, on a sick child. It had been given to Toby by Eleanor, in the hope that it might help to cheer some of his lonely hours. She also brought several very pretty prints, which she hung on the bare walls. She thought the room looked less desolate with them, and remembered that Toby once told her, that-he was so tired looking at nothing. It is certainly very trying for a sick person, especially for a sick child, to look day after day on whitewashed walls. Even if they are papered, one grows weary of counting the figures.  It-is'something like repeating the alphabet, or the multi-- plication. table backwards, in order to get to sleep. Eleanor thought that having a house without- pictures, was next thing to having no house at all, and she selected those, which she thought would interest and improve Toby at the same time. She was was generous, as Toby's mother had said.

'But she did not bestow her charities indis- criminately. She used her wealth as one wh6 was to give an account of it hereafter. Toby's mother was- a very worthy person, and had once been a favorite ser- vant in the Marshall family. Unfortunately, she married a man who was unable to support her. He was a good mech anic, but was prevented by ill health from attending to his business. The result could easily be foreseen. They were soon reduced to penury, though he did not live long to be a burden on her hands. It was not surpris- ing that their child should be puny and delicate-the offspring, like thousands of others, of hereditary disease. There can be no sadder sight than a suffering child. Child- hood is naturally connected, in our minds, with health and happiness. Alas! that the reality should not prove the same. With all her industry, Toby's mother could not surround him with necessary comforts, and her courage almost failed her, when she heard him moan hour after hour with pain. "Mother," he said, one day, "why can't I get up, and be like other children? Tom Jones told me that he could run a mile, and it never hurt him." "You have always been a very sickly child, Toby. That is the reason you cannot go about. But I hope you will be well some day, and then you can run equal to Tom Jones." "But I want to go now," said Toby, fretfilly. ;'I'm so tired of staying still, and I can't see-but just a little   THE ARTIST S DREAM,       365 bit of the sky from this window; and my head aches with the noise of the carts and omnibuses. Mother, when summer comes, and the weather is very hot, can't we go away from this big town?" "No, my child," answered the mother, sadly; and visions of a fire in August, of the wash-tub, and ironing- table, came before her. Eleanor entered the room at that moment, and asked what made Toby look so solemn. With all the inno- cence of childhood, Toby referred his request to her. She told him that she would take him to her country place the following summer, and that he should breathe pure mountain air, and see beautiful trees and flowers, and more than a bit of God's blue' sky. Toby was glad, and promised to be a good boy, and not complain to his mother any more. He looked at Eleanor with admiring love, and thought her even more beautiful than the angel in the picture. Eleanor did indeed look very lovely. Her black dress seemed rather' to add to, than to detract from her general appearance of refinement. Her com- plexion was delicate as ever; her eye as lustrous; her form as graceful- "And overall a softened halo cast, Woven from tearful memories of the past." Eleanor did not fold her hands, and nurse her grief. A life of active usefulness opened before her, and she accepted it. Many a home was made more comfortable, and many a heart lighter, by her cheerful words and generous bounty. Work! work I work!

The sun was slowly sinking behind the western hills, shedding a flood of beauty over the classic land of Italy. The gales, cool and bland, fanned Marion's warm cheek; and gen- tly kissed her broad, white forehead. Quiet and still she lay, until strains of melody floated on the evening air. "I know those voices," she said; "sinmg me to rest, dear brother and sister, sing again. But hark I I hear other music, sweeter far, than any earthly sounds. 'Tis the angel-choir, whispering ' Come!"' She sank to bleep. A smile of peace rested on the pale lips. She had breathed her last farewell.

When Arthur came in, soon afterwards, the child ran to him, saying: "Papa, a beautiful angel has come to take Aunt Ma- rion home; but we will go and live with her some day." Arthur went to the window, where his wife stood looking at the sunset. "How gloriously beautiful, it is!" he said. "Beautiful!" she replied. -"One might say with Baron Bunsen, ' The love of -God is in everything.' God is life, love-love that wills ;-will that loves. There is no death in God.'
