PREFACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
IN the following romance, the writer has attempted to shadow forth scenes in the life of the&#xD;
Western hunter, trapper, and adventurer. How far he has succeeded, the reader must judge.&#xD;
It is easier to find fault with a book, than to write one; although in this respect the author has&#xD;
no reason to complain, inasmuch as his ' SILvIm KNIFE,' and many other tales, have been re-&#xD;
ceived with much more favor than he had presumed to expect. The hero of the following pages&#xD;
may not be without his faults, and Gilmore and Buston may possibly be overdrawn; but if the&#xD;
writer has succeeded in his design in any degree, and the indulgent reader finds a pleasant hour&#xD;
over the pages of 'BLACK RAL 'H,' he will feel himself sufficiently rewarded for his labor.&#xD;

CHAPTER         I.&#xD;
THE OSAGE.&#xD;
STOOD leaning thoughtfully upon mytifle&#xD;
'be night was clear and beautiful. The&#xD;
fleecy clouds-that occasionally floated across&#xD;
the disc of the moon, obscured it for a moment&#xD;
only. The stars had a soft, silvery glow.&#xD;
From th, cninence upon which I stood, I&#xD;
could gaze over a vast extent of country. Be!&#xD;
fore me flowed the Red Fork of the Arkansas&#xD;
River. Upon my left, the distant peaks of the&#xD;
Rocky Mountains were visible. Upon my right,&#xD;
were prairies, stretching far away, and lost to&#xD;
view in the dim distance.&#xD;
Not far from me the smoke of a cheerful -fre&#xD;
went curling upward. Near it were too appar-&#xD;
ently sleeping persons wrapped in blankets, and&#xD;
stretched upon the earth. They were the comn&#xD;
panions of-my journeyingil through the West.&#xD;
I had laid down to sleep in the first part of&#xD;
the evening, but sleep did not visit my eyelidss.&#xD;
and Ihad arisen silently from the earth without&#xD;
disturbing them,. in order to contemplate the&#xD;
quiet beauty of the uight;, until I could slumber&#xD;
better.&#xD;
r wansoon lost in contemplation. The placid&#xD;
skie ;he dreamy +Wglight; the sighing of the&#xD;
&#xD;
running river ; the gentle murmur of the wind&#xD;
amid the trees, all conspired to make me reflect&#xD;
 e.&#xD;
As I stood in the indolent attitude I have&#xD;
named, kay attention was arrested by a moving&#xD;
object upon the opposite bank. At first I was&#xD;
at a loss to determine to what class of animated&#xD;
creatures it belonged; but as it drew nearer,&#xD;
all doubts on that subject were dispelled; for,&#xD;
from a stooping, itt arose suddenly to an erect&#xD;
posture, and revealed the figure Of an athleti.&#xD;
Osage.warrior. There was no time   lose; in&#xD;
an instant my rifle was at my shoulder. I&#xD;
pulled ; the look fell upon the cap, but there was&#xD;
no report ; my rifle had missed fire; and a I&#xD;
threw it from me in ;despar I heard a trium.&#xD;
pliant laugh from the grim lips of the .atg?.&#xD;
A sickness came over me ; I gasped for breath,&#xD;
and felt that my last hour had come. .Iaw  he&#xD;
savage level his piece ; I saw the mosbeszans&#xD;
glisten upon the long, dark barrel; and .n, w&#xD;
his eyes were glancing along the sightss  that&#xD;
his finger was upon the trigg&#xD;
How rapidly the thou ghiRythe so } hrgi the&#xD;

of a whole lifetime-seem,-to passe oyes the field&#xD;

BLACK RALPH&#xD;
&#xD;
our hours misspent come and stare us in the&#xD;
face ; all the good we might have done, but have&#xD;
not, is realized with a bitterness previously un-&#xD;
known; we exist an age in a single flash of&#xD;
time. I was not angry ; the evil demon that&#xD;
sometimes rises within me was silent.&#xD;
The muzzle of the warrior'srifle covered my&#xD;
heart ; but he did not fire. Like the cat that&#xD;
toys with its victim before rending it, he' dotzb-&#xD;
less experienced a savage'delight in holding me&#xD;
a moment in suspense so terrible. The sudden-&#xD;
ness of the whole transaction had in a measure&#xD;
paralyzed me. I knew full well that it was too&#xD;
late to attempt to evade the vengeance of the.&#xD;
Osage, and giving myself up for a lost man, I&#xD;
awaited my fate.&#xD;
But the painted savage never fired ; he fell&#xD;
suddenly forward with the rifle still in his hands,&#xD;
ati never moved again.&#xD;
pingthe perspiration from my brow, I&#xD;
wondered at what I had seen, and could with&#xD;
difcultjy eedit my senses.  When I had recov-&#xD;
'eret 'su$iently to do so, I took my rifle from&#xD;
'tib earth, and with a heart full of gratitude,&#xD;
stagg  diltowards the fie where my companions&#xD;
irl eping   not knowitin how to account for&#xD;
hat    had witnessed.&#xD;
,'As', I a  r oaehed, one of the sleepers was&#xD;
ene       y myfootsteps, and seizing his- rifle&#xD;
1sap     ickly to his feet.&#xD;
'   isIlInore, be not alarmed,' I managed&#xD;
6   i ulats, a he was in the act of leaving&#xD;
t thught it was one of the varmints,' re.&#xD;
p6l Ghlinore, restoring his rifle to its place,&#xD;
the trouble'? you look-kind of white.&#xD;
the mouth.'&#xD;
ned, as well as T was able, what had&#xD;
inspired.&#xD;
'eyoa hear any report when the onregen-&#xD;
rate critter weut down ?' asked the trapper.&#xD;
1t    sound   Hefell{as if 'th eIIHand that&#xD;
, 4~.  nec him had stricken him down.'&#xD;
a   enhe'll not be likely to git pgi till&#xD;
S t thiYuet shallbe ?dowed, sahl Gilinore,&#xD;
11inhis voie, and shaidig his hea tisti-&#xD;
rigutly. And then he added in a still lower tone:&#xD;
&#xD;
' Black Ralph is doin' his work of death.'&#xD;
'And who is ' Black Ralph?' I asked, my&#xD;
curiosity much excited.&#xD;
'That's what I can't say exactly;' replied&#xD;
the trapper, almost in a whisper, 'but he's one'&#xD;
that deals out death in silence; one as can't be&#xD;
tracked, nor found out; one as you can't keep&#xD;
the run on ; one as is seldom seen, but -often&#xD;
felt; one as is sure death to the -red varmints;&#xD;
one as is alters nearand allers a great way off;&#xD;
one as none on us can perfectly comprehend;&#xD;
one as it isn't best to talk on a great deal  The&#xD;
Ingin critters call him the 'Forest Fiend ;' but&#xD;
I can't call him nothin' better than Black Ralph.&#xD;
No sound gives notice of his coming' or goin',&#xD;
and nobody's any wiser than afore.'&#xD;
i-s it a man you are talking-of?' I asked.&#xD;
'I havn't, never 1been illuminated on that&#xD;
subject,' replied  Gilmore.   I suppose  it&#xD;
must be some kind of a man, but what sort I&#xD;
don't know.'&#xD;
'Why is he called Black Ralph'?'&#xD;
'It's a sort of nickname that he's got by comn-&#xD;
mon consent like but the Ingins say he's black&#xD;
all over,, and'6ncomnion ugly in his personal ap-&#xD;
pearance, looking' like:nothin' airthly'&#xD;
Then you really believe that this personage,&#xD;
by some strange agency, killed the Osage war,&#xD;
ior !&#xD;
'It's a sure thing.  Trri that varmint over-&#xD;
and you'll find a, shnall wound right in the region&#xD;
of the heart.  It's allers there when Black&#xD;
IaVh is about.'&#xD;
I shook my head doubtfully.&#xD;
'You dont seacely credit it,' added Gilmore,&#xD;
'but nothing' can't be no truer.  We'll cross the&#xD;
Red Fork, and you shall-see.for'yourself; for&#xD;
seem' is believin'..&#xD;
'It is true;' I replied, ' that I can't account&#xD;
for the strange manner in whieh the 'savage fell&#xD;

By lashing together the trunks of trees, we&#xD;
formed'a rude raft, upon which we crossed the&#xD;
river. In a short time we reached the spot where&#xD;
the Osage had fallen.  He lay upon his face,&#xD;
and his, hands still grasped the rifle.&#xD;
Gilmore turned him over, and there was no&#xD;
sign of life within him. The moonlight streamed&#xD;
down upon his swarthy chest. Directly over,&#xD;
the region of the heart was a small and scarcely&#xD;
perceptible wound, from whbeb the dark coagu-&#xD;
lated blood was slowly oozing.&#xD;
'I thought sb,' said the trapper, in a subdued&#xD;
tone. *'That's his mark.'&#xD;
' That resembles the wound of a rifle shot.' I;&#xD;
remarked, as I attentively examined the body.&#xD;
'3ut it's very strange that I heard no report.&#xD;
It is a quiet night; the running of the river&#xD;
makes little sound, and the leaves scarcely stir.'&#xD;
It's allers so when Black Ralph is abroad.&#xD;
The red critters fall down and die when they&#xD;
ain't expectin' no harm. No matter what they're&#xD;
doin', whether they're walkin', sittin', or stand.&#xD;
in,' it's all the same ; they jump of a sudden&#xD;
into the air, and fall down without a pulse of&#xD;
life in 'em. It isn't one tribe, or two, or three,&#xD;
for that matter, but the whole red race that s'uf&#xD;
fers. The' silent tread of this unknown critter&#xD;
is arter 'em by day and by night, in fair and in&#xD;
foul. This ain't the first varmint I've looked on&#xD;
in the course lof my nateral life that didn't know&#xD;
how he cum to his eend, and coudn't give no&#xD;
satisfactry account on't. -&#xD;
'Very singular,' I mused.&#xD;
IIt aint nothin more nor less than singular,'&#xD;
added the trapper.&#xD;
'What shall be done with the body?  Some&#xD;
of his friends may find it, and suspicion may be&#xD;
fastened on us as authors of his death.'&#xD;
'We'llthrow it into the water, and let it float&#xD;
towards the wigwams of his 'people,t said Gil-&#xD;
more.&#xD;
The trapper drew the inaniinaite fonrmof the&#xD;
Osage warrior to the edge of the water, and&#xD;
thirew it in.  t sank, arose againand went&#xD;
yrhA the rier.&#xD;

CHAP-TER       II.&#xD;
BLACK ALPa.&#xD;
T is now fitting that I shbuld speak- more&#xD;
particularly of myself. ,4.ro'viug disposi-&#xD;
-  tion had prompted me to)become a denizen&#xD;
of the forest.&#xD;
For some months I had roamed through the&#xD;
wilds of the West, meeting with many startling&#xD;
adventures, and by some good fortune making&#xD;
numerous hair-breadth escapes from the natural&#xD;
lords of the wilderness-the savages.&#xD;
Gilmore, the trappr, alluded to in the fore.&#xD;
going chapter, and a yo ng man bthe name of&#xD;
Arthur Dale, had been companion of my wan-&#xD;
derings.&#xD;
I sojourned in the wilderness merely fem a&#xD;
love of adventure; but it was not so with Ar-&#xD;
thur Dale.&#xD;
Six months previously, his nearest relatives&#xD;
had emigrated to the far West, with the hope of&#xD;
bettering their condition in a worldly point of&#xD;
view. Among these friends were a father, sis-&#xD;
ter, and brother. Their intention had been to&#xD;
settle far up upon the Red Fork of the Arkan.&#xD;
sas River&#xD;
Arthur had tarried behind for the purpose of&#xD;
collecting monies due his father and others of&#xD;
the emigrants. Thinrbusiness had delayed him&#xD;
longer than he had anticipated, and it was some&#xD;
months before he was ready to follow in the trail&#xD;
of his friends. I had fallen in with him airF'ort&#xD;
Gibson, and since the period of our first meet&#xD;
ing we had been the firmest of friends.&#xD;
Gilmore was an old trapper whom U had also&#xD;
accidentally met during my peregrinations. A&#xD;
strange kind of friendship had been the result&#xD;
of our companionship. He seemed to entertain&#xD;
for me the love of a'father, while I,,in trt"&#xD;
felt for him the respect of a son.My' a4&#xD;
and impulaive di position had not{  givhi&#xD;
aise of offence.&#xD;
Many misgivings had filled tl      fA&#xD;
thur Dale as we eered te IRed&#xD;
Fork. lie had confid  i               dh&#xD;
friends some two days bdi&#xD;

BLACK RALPH&#xD;
&#xD;
a common boss-that it wasn't, by no means.&#xD;
It was about twice the size of common anermals&#xD;
of that kind, and black as jet. This tremen-&#xD;
dous critter abot past us like an arrer, with his&#xD;
ears laid back, and his nose thrust for'ard like a&#xD;
reg'lar pinter.  When I assart that it war an&#xD;
ugly lookin' beast, I dont express half that 1&#xD;
raly mean. . But one thing you musn't forget ;&#xD;
the critters feet didn't make no noise, 'and he&#xD;
passed clean by without any sound.  That was&#xD;
oncommon ; for the feet of sich a mighty aner-&#xD;
mad ought to make considerable clatterin', if not&#xD;
more.&#xD;
Now I'm a coming' to the toughest part o' the&#xD;
story-the half human varmint that rode him.&#xD;
He was near about as large for a man as thehoss&#xD;
was-for a boss. ,His dress I couldn't very well&#xD;
describe, for he went by, as I was sayin', as if&#xD;
the old Niek had kicked him in eend, and I&#xD;
ain't' by no means surd but he had. He might&#xD;
have been dressed in bar skins, for that matter&#xD;
for he was black and shaggy as a nateral wild&#xD;
beast.  Away they swept, hoss and rider, and]&#xD;
didn't see 'em no more, and didn't wish to.. Bu&#xD;
idn't that half creed Ingin indervidooal' tur&#xD;
'fie about the gills, though?  I expected t&#xD;
see h6 sink into the nateral bosom of the sile.&#xD;
'It' ~tack Ralph !' said he, and went righ&#xD;
into the eap, and didn't show his head agi&#xD;
'till the next; , and I couldn't git a word ;ou&#xD;
o' him.&#xD;
The fact is, thlt when an Ingin sees Blac&#xD;
Ralph,-he thinks itkwarnin' to him that death&#xD;
&#xD;
I went dereetly to the spot where I kept 'em&#xD;
concealed. The cache was-tore open,:and not a&#xD;
single skin was to be found.  I must confess&#xD;
that my onregenerate natur begun to rile up,&#xD;
and I vowed to roller the critter 'till I could-&#xD;
bring old Two Shooter to bear upon him.&#xD;
I'm used to follerin' a trail, and it warn't long&#xD;
afore I was arter him.&#xD;
Well, what do, you think ?  I hadn't gone&#xD;
three hundred yards afore I found the varmint,&#xD;
flat on his back, and the peltries layin', beside&#xD;
him. I examined him, and found a sinall hole&#xD;
in the left breast. He was wounded in the heart,&#xD;
and it was the handy-work of BlackRalph. I&#xD;
took up my peltries, and left him there, as I&#xD;
had found him, wonderin' how strangely people&#xD;
would die.sometimes when death seemed a long&#xD;
way off,&#xD;
CHAPTER         III.&#xD;

I       when a large buffalo made his appear-&#xD;

His horse understanding what was recfuired&#xD;

n was levelled upon the shaggy front of the un-&#xD;

echoing through the woods, and the buffalo, with&#xD;

of a quadruped whatsomever. A great many&#xD;
of, the' copper-colored varmints call me the&#xD;
' Death Slot,' and allers think it prudent to&#xD;
keep a civil tongue in their heads,:or to keep&#xD;
out of the way when I'm known to be about.&#xD;
They know what to depend on when they par&#xD;
ceive Two Shooter a coming' to my shoulder, and&#xD;
nothin' wont set 'em a howlin' quicker.'&#xD;
'I am  tempted to, call you Never-fail after&#xD;
this,' retorted Dale, smiling.          .&#xD;
'It wouldn't be so bad a name as you might&#xD;
think,' replied the trapper; but my native mod-&#xD;
esty wont permit me to trumpet my own fame.&#xD;
The time may come when I can prove my good&#xD;
qualities by my works, and not be obliged to&#xD;
speak on 'em as I have in this instance.'&#xD;
The buffalo was soon dressed,'and we regaled&#xD;
ourselves upon the flesh; it was the first we&#xD;
had found during our journey up the river, and&#xD;
we did not eat sparingly. Those familiar with&#xD;
Western life know that the hump of a buffalo&#xD;
s a delicious morsel, highly esteemed by the&#xD;
hunter and trapper.&#xD;
While we were roasting it, the delicious odor&#xD;
attracted several smaltk wolves, resembling the&#xD;
prairie wolf, who locked at us most wistfully,&#xD;
occasionally entertaining us with a mournful&#xD;
howl.&#xD;
'It's gettin' so near night,' said Gilmore, 'I&#xD;
reckon we'd better content ourselves to stay&#xD;
where we are 'till morning . There's nothin'&#xD;
gained by bein' in a great hurry.'&#xD;
This proposal was very agreeable to ie, but&#xD;
to Arthur Dale'it was anything but welcome ;&#xD;
he being desirous to move forward as fast as pos&#xD;
sible, in order to learn something in relation to&#xD;
his friends, on whose account he was hourly&#xD;
growing more uneasy.&#xD;
We heaped up the logs, and when the night&#xD;
set in a cheerful blaze streamed up,"and gave&#xD;
an air of -rude comfort to our lonely camping&#xD;
ground. As we sat by the fire, listening to the&#xD;
tales of Gilmore, we were startled by the sud-&#xD;
den appearance of a stranger. -&#xD;
He proecito. e 'a  herokee, whom we had&#xD;
met at Fort Gibson. lie was called Prairie&#xD;
&#xD;
ST FIEND.&#xD;
&#xD;
19&#xD;
&#xD;
Wolf, and among his people was a person of&#xD;
some consequence,&#xD;
He and others had been sent to Fort Gibson&#xD;
by his tribe, in order to make some reparation,&#xD;
if possible, for sundry outrages they- had com-&#xD;
mitted at divers times, for which they had good&#xD;
- cause to suppose they should be punished by&#xD;
the whites. How well he had sped on his mis-&#xD;
sion, I knew not ; but it was evident that 'his&#xD;
reception had not been just what he had hoped.&#xD;
He hobbled and turned his horse loose, and&#xD;
seated himself by our fire, with all. the assur-&#xD;
anee characteristic of the race. Gilmore re-&#xD;
ceived him in true Indian style-scarcely no-&#xD;
I ticed him-said not a word.&#xD;
Prairie Wolf helped himself to a liberal slice&#xD;
of buffalo meat, roasted it over the blazing fire,&#xD;
I and truth forces me to say he did ample justice&#xD;
to his name.&#xD;
When this interesting piece of business had&#xD;
been dispatched, Gilmore lighted his pipe, puff-&#xD;
ed a few mouthfulls of the fragrant weed, and&#xD;
passed it to his guest, who followed his example&#xD;
with Indian gravity, and then, in turn, passed&#xD;
it to me ; and so it went around.&#xD;
We felt not a little curious to know why he&#xD;
had followed us; whether he had come alone,.&#xD;
l or if more of his tribe were near. We weirnot&#xD;
kept long in. doubt. Some of his fried s had&#xD;
been slain by the mysterious being cale&amp;amp; Black&#xD;
Ralph. They were found at various times, a&#xD;
short distance from their lodges, with a single&#xD;
wound in the left breast. In some instances&#xD;
others had been near them at the time of their&#xD;
death; but no sound was heard to indicate that&#xD;
- a death wound had been dealt. The victims&#xD;
were seen to leap upward, and then fall lifeless&#xD;
upon the earth.&#xD;
Upon looking hurriedly round fox: the per.&#xD;
petrator of the 'deed, no living being could be&#xD;
discovered. They would holein th&#xD;

&#xD;
vise some means of avenging the death of their&#xD;
warriors.&#xD;
Butall were at a loss.  Their enemy was.&#xD;
unseen and unknown. Many of them believed&#xD;
him to be of no mortal origin. All they knew&#xD;
of him was from hearsay, as those who averred&#xD;
they had seen him never lived long afterward&#xD;
to describe his appearance.&#xD;
At last, a few of the most resolute of the&#xD;
tribe had volunteered to go in quest of the mys-&#xD;
terious being so terrible to their race.,&#xD;
Prairie Wolf was-of the number who had de-&#xD;
voted themselves to this task. A feast was,&#xD;
made, the war dance danced, and then the&#xD;
avengers bade adieu to their friends, took their&#xD;
muskets; mounted their steeds, andleft the lodg-&#xD;
es of their people.&#xD;
Gilmore:heard this relation in silence, and&#xD;
shook his head gravely when it was .concluded.&#xD;
'Do-you expect to find. Black Ralph,' he&#xD;
asked, signi lcantly.&#xD;
'Prairie Wolf is called brave in wa, he an-&#xD;
swered. 'He never turns his back upon the&#xD;
enemy.   He never returns to his village with-&#xD;
out the scalps of his enemies to hang up at the&#xD;
door of his lodge.'&#xD;
'You may be.a great warrior, but I reckon,&#xD;
as how Black Ralph will live longer nor you.&#xD;
Thesame sun as ;will shine upon your dead&#xD;
face, will shine upon that unaccountable Critter&#xD;
a livin' man.'&#xD;
A;slight change passed over the features of&#xD;
the savage, Perhaps to him there was some-&#xD;
thing prophetic in the words of the trapper.&#xD;
'It.strikes me, red-skin, that you want see&#xD;
the smoke of four wigwam no more. "Sunthin'&#xD;
seem;sto tell:me that the silent steps o' death&#xD;
are arterye.  It's my impression the sun wont&#xD;
andre a  yethree times afore there'll be a hole&#xD;
ie our left breast, jest over the heart.'&#xD;
PrairieWolf made no reply.&#xD;
It's a proper easytway of gettin' out o' the&#xD;
world,' added Gilmore.  'It's my belief that&#xD;
theatter as.goes under in that say never&#xD;
kw  what hrt him-'&#xD;
Teiel tof prairie Wolf is verybig,' said&#xD;
@th Idian, gravely,.&#xD;
&#xD;
'Not big enough for him you're arter,' re-&#xD;
plied the trapper.  ' You'd better pass the&#xD;
night in singin' your death song, or you may,&#xD;
be obleeged to go to the celerbrated huntin'-&#xD;
grounds without it.'&#xD;
Wishing Prairie Wolf pleasant dreams, we&#xD;
stretched ourselves out by the fire, and were&#xD;
soon oblivious in sleep.&#xD;
If I d-eaied that night, by some strange in-,&#xD;
ensisteney I dreamed of Flora Dale, so .much&#xD;
had the glowing words of Arthur impressed me&#xD;
in her favor.&#xD;
We arose with the sun, and pressed forward,&#xD;
momentarily expecting to find the new settle.&#xD;
ment. As we progressed, we found the way&#xD;
more difficult. The river, as we neared -its&#xD;
source, grew narrower, and we were sometimes&#xD;
obliged te deviate from our course, making wide&#xD;
circuits around high bills, which seemed to rise&#xD;
in our pathway continually.&#xD;
On account of these obstacles, we did not&#xD;
travel very fast, and were forced to halt before&#xD;
night ; for both ourselves and beasts were&#xD;
weary.&#xD;
We encamped on a tributary of the Red&#xD;
Fork, where we found{excellent pasturage for&#xD;
the horses. They fell to cropping the soft grass&#xD;
with an earnestness that betokened they had&#xD;
lost nothing of their appetite by hard travelling.&#xD;
As soon as a fire was kindled, I stretched-&#xD;
myself beside it, and slept. I awoke in about&#xD;
an hour, and found my friends busily engaged&#xD;
preparing supper, which in the wilderness is a&#xD;
simple process.&#xD;
The sun went down, and the moon came up.&#xD;
My friends ate in silence, and then sought&#xD;
repose after the day's fatigues.  But I did not&#xD;
-feel inclined to slumber.  The beauty of the&#xD;
night invited me forth to silent communion with&#xD;
nature.&#xD;
Taking my rifle, I followed the devious wind-&#xD;
ings of the stream.  I~s sloping banks were cov-&#xD;
ered with tender verda'e, and its waters had a&#xD;
musical urmur which wooed me on.&#xD;
Sometimes it wound though an open wood&#xD;
land ; sometimes through p thcets ofurze ; and&#xD;
sometimes through delightful mneadows.&#xD;
&#xD;
'The emigrants should have settled upon this&#xD;
tributary stream.!' I exclaimed, ' and not upon&#xD;
the Red Fork. Here is an excellent soil, rich&#xD;
meadow lands and uplands, to tempt the tillers&#xD;
of the earth.'&#xD;
I had scarcely expressed myself in this man-&#xD;
ner., before Iwas sure, that I heard the barking&#xD;
of a dog.&#xD;
For the first time during my solitary walk, I&#xD;
thought of the adventures of the previous night.&#xD;
I paused, and felt that I'had been imprudent in&#xD;
wandering so far from my companions.&#xD;
The barking continued, and appeared at no&#xD;
great distance. At first I was undecided what&#xD;
to do, whether to go forward, remain perfectly&#xD;
still, or beat a cautious retreat.  I might be in&#xD;
the vicinage of an Indian village or encampment,&#xD;
and consequently in a.position of great danger.&#xD;
But this feeling of indecision passed in a mo-&#xD;
ment; I resolved to go forward. I waited un-&#xD;
til the dog had ceased barking, an' then&#xD;
atiously went forward in the direction whence&#xD;
the so~und had proceeded.&#xD;
Before I had advanced ten minutes in this&#xD;
manner,   reached a small clearing, and beheld,&#xD;
to my great amazement, some half a dozen cab-&#xD;
ins built of logs. Through the chinks of some}&#xD;
of tbese primitive dwellings, a cheerfl-l light&#xD;
was reflected, while the smoke went curling up&#xD;
fantastically from the roofs.&#xD;
I was about to go forward to learn what kind&#xD;
of a settlement I had found, when a new object&#xD;
of interest diverted me from my purpose.&#xD;
It was a female figure that had suddenly&#xD;
passed before my vision, and riveted my atten-&#xD;
tion. r She stood upon the bank of the stream&#xD;
whose graceful windings I had been following&#xD;
for the last three quarters of an hour.&#xD;
fleF attitude was one of perfect ease and re-&#xD;
pose-gone which lends such unriralled grace to&#xD;
a symmetrical figure. The moonbeams revealed&#xD;
enough of her person and features to assure me,&#xD;
that she was young and exquisitely fair. When&#xD;
the memory of earthly. things fades away, the.&#xD;
emotions of that moment will be the last -to lin-&#xD;
ger. I felt mslthwihng worshipper of a&#xD;
being s. divinely moulded.&#xD;
&#xD;
'lora Dale!' I said, when I was sufficient-&#xD;
ly calm to do so, aking a step forward.:,&#xD;
The whole attitude of the maiden changed,&#xD;
and she was in the act of flying from me, when&#xD;
I added :&#xD;
'I bring tidings from your brother.'&#xD;
She turned toward me with surprise depicted&#xD;
upon every feature.&#xD;
' Be not 'alarmed,' I continued, 'I am the&#xD;
bearer of good news. Your brother is well, and&#xD;
not an b u 's walk from us.'&#xD;
'You are a stranger,' she replied, timidly,&#xD;
' but if you bring news from Arthur, you will&#xD;
certainly receive the welcome of a friend.'&#xD;
'Had I not met your brother, I should nit&#xD;
have known that I now stand in the presence of&#xD;
Flora Dale.'&#xD;
The maiden blushed deeply.&#xD;
' And d6 you recognize me only fron the pid-&#xD;
ture he has drawn of me ?' she asked.&#xD;
'Believe me, Miss Dale, I never gazed upon&#xD;
your face before ; but I knew well It could 'ie&#xD;
none other than Flora Dale ; for Arthur has&#xD;
often described you with the eloquence of a lo'r-&#xD;
'He's a partial brother,' replied Flora, with a&#xD;
smile, 'and I must reprove him for his exaggera-&#xD;
ted notions of my merits. But I have  nearly&#xD;
forgotten to extend to you the hospitality of our&#xD;
rude home. Let us hasten to impart the good&#xD;
news to my father and brother.'&#xD;
'Seek not to detain me, Mifs Dale' Te&#xD;
most acceptable service I can render, will be to&#xD;
return and relieve the anxiety of Arthur in e..&#xD;
gard to your safety.'&#xD;

I feared as much,' I replied. ' You are too&#xD;
near the Cherokees.'&#xD;
'Much toe near,' returned Flora.   They&#xD;
say the country is all theirs, and we have no&#xD;
right to make settlements upon it.  The eon-&#xD;
sequeces are what I have said-a continued&#xD;
fear o pillage and bloodshed, and in fact, of ut-&#xD;
ter extermination.'&#xD;

are the sanguinary encounters he has had with&#xD;
the Indiana, Nothing daunts him, and he re-&#xD;
gards the whole red race with the deepest ha-&#xD;
tred.'&#xD;
'Icannot say that I differ from him in that&#xD;
respect.  I never could breathe freely where&#xD;
there was;an Indian. For the life of me I can-&#xD;
not help feeling that a savage is lawful game ;&#xD;
as much so as the wild wolf, the bear, or the&#xD;
buffalo. It is no credit to the dictates of my&#xD;
hears, when I say that I never behold a red mat&#xD;
without the desire to shoot him down as I would&#xD;
some hurtful beast.  When I confess that I&#xD;
hate them, I do not express a tithe of the bitter&#xD;
enmity I feel for that race of painted fiends&#xD;
called Indians.'&#xD;
I observed that Flora gazed intently into my&#xD;
face as Ispoke, and instinctively shrank from&#xD;
me as she beheld its changed and fierce expres-&#xD;
lion.&#xD;
Such a feeling is dreadful,!' she exclaimed&#xD;
You are but too much like my father.    Oh&#xD;
why should man burn with such,.bitter hatred&#xD;
towards his fellow man.'.&#xD;
Pardon me,' I said, with sonie asperity, 'I&#xD;
do   t call Indians my fellow men.  They are&#xD;
demons in human forms, knowing neither rier-&#xD;
ty, magnanimity, or one of the softer and better&#xD;
mpulses that sway the bosom of a white mari&#xD;
I have not spared them, neither shall I wheni&#xD;
dthey cross my path.'&#xD;
&#xD;
Again Flora shrank from me, and shuddered&#xD;
at the expression which my previously tranquil&#xD;
features had assumed.&#xD;
'But,' I immediately added, with a smile,&#xD;
'I must away to Arthur to be the bearer of wel-&#xD;
come news.' Bowing respectfully, I turned&#xD;
and hurried away, with my heart full of Flora&#xD;
Dale.&#xD;
I had walked over that same ground a few&#xD;
minutes before, with only a few indistinct and&#xD;
half remembered dreams of her; but now I saw&#xD;
nothing save her bright image.&#xD;
It is time that the reader should know that&#xD;
I am, and ever was, a creature of impulse.&#xD;
My great fault is, and has been, that I go to&#xD;
extremes in all things, and know no middle&#xD;
course. My dislikes are not simply dislikes,&#xD;
but absolute hatreds.  My resentments are not&#xD;
merely resentments, but perfect madness. My&#xD;
passions have never been conquered by. whole-&#xD;
some self-restraint.  I have from  childhood&#xD;
known no master but myself, and only thetvo .&#xD;
extremes of .love and hatred. There are tips&#xD;
when I regret this peculiarity most deeply ; but&#xD;
I cannot conquer it-it was the fault ofmy youth&#xD;
and must be the fault of my manhood.&#xD;
The reader will not be much surprised after&#xD;
this confession, that I left Flora as deeply in love&#xD;
as it was possible for a man to be at first sight.&#xD;
She was the same I had seen in my dreams ;&#xD;
and it was by my dreams that I knew her, and&#xD;
not by Arthur's description, as I had said.&#xD;
Yes, I loved' Flora Dale--loved her as I&#xD;
believed no other living man could love. Every-&#xD;
feature of her face; every intonation of her&#xD;
voice ; every look ; every gesture ; all her di-&#xD;
vine symmetry of form, was indelibly impressed&#xD;
upon my soul: never to fade, never to grow less&#xD;
distinct ; never to become less divine and glori,&#xD;
ous. I was an idolator-I worshipped--I a-&#xD;
dored, and asked for no fairer or better divinity.&#xD;
You may call this madness; you may call it&#xD;
wronging my Maker ; but Icould not help it;&#xD;
it was so, and  as it was, so I relate it, with-&#xD;
out shame or prevarication.&#xD;

THE FORE&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
soft earth. Come on'; they have gone this way.&#xD;
Here is a limb broke off. She did it with her.&#xD;
own fair fingers, I'll be bound. And see here's&#xD;
sumuthin' more ; it's the band she tied up her&#xD;
glossy black hair with, she threw it down most&#xD;
likely that we might track her by it. -I shant&#xD;
foller this trail long you may depend on't. I&#xD;
shall find out what the critters are drivin' at&#xD;
soon, or my name ain't Gilmore.  When I can&#xD;
judge pretty well of the gineral direction of the&#xD;
varmints, I shall go arter them in a straight&#xD;
line, and strike the trail, it may be many long&#xD;
miles froi this.  An hour's travel will tell me&#xD;
which way they mean to steer.'&#xD;
It was now night, Gilmore strode on before&#xD;
us like a tall, daik spectre. Well acquainted&#xD;
with Indian wiles and Indian warfare, it cost&#xD;
him but little trouble to follow the trail. For&#xD;
an hour or more we followed his gliding move-&#xD;
ments, without uttering a word.&#xD;
'I know what I'm about now,' said the trap-&#xD;
per. - Their course is towards Canadian River ;&#xD;
we'll take the shortest way, and may be able&#xD;
perhaps, to cut them off afore mornin'. It's&#xD;
the Cherokee's we're arter, or I' dont know&#xD;
much about Ingins.'&#xD;
We took the advice of Gilmore and pressed&#xD;
forward as fast as our limbs could bear us.&#xD;
I felt no fatigue,'no fear-of danger ; I thought&#xD;
of Flora only ; and that thought gave me&#xD;
strength. Poor Arthur suffered much fear and&#xD;
anxiety, and was deeply impatient for the time&#xD;
to couie, when he could strike a blow for his&#xD;
beloved sister.&#xD;
There was not a heart among us that did&#xD;
not burn to avenge the wrong of Flora. At&#xD;
break of day, much to our satisfaction, we came&#xD;
upon the trail once more ; after following it for&#xD;
a time, we found two trails diverging widely.&#xD;
We made a short halt to determine what&#xD;
course to pursue.  At length it was decided that&#xD;
Gilmore and myself should take the lefand each&#xD;
party press forward with 1ll has i  au on.&#xD;
We did so, and our companions :e soon&#xD;
lost to view.  We kept the trail unil Iear noon&#xD;
when we reached Canadiae River-, where it&#xD;
seemed to 'terminate and baffe us.&#xD;

.ST  FIEND.                              81&#xD;
' Shall we cross ?' I asked.'&#xD;
Gilmore shook his head dubiously.&#xD;
They cant be a long way off,' he said, 'and&#xD;
its hard to tell which will be the safest side of&#xD;
the river. It seems to me there's some devil-&#xD;
try afloat, and we can't be two cautious'; throw&#xD;
yourself down here in the bushes and I'll go&#xD;
for'ard and reconnoitre. If I dont return in an&#xD;
hour, you may set me down among the lost ones.'&#xD;
Somewhat reluctantly I laid myself down&#xD;
upon the ground, and saw Gilmore glide swiftly&#xD;
yet softly away.&#xD;
One may be impatient for the lingering steps&#xD;
of his swe-etheart ; he may be impatient for his&#xD;
wedding night ; he may be impatient under the&#xD;
lash, or the surgeon's knife ; he may be impa-&#xD;
tient to meet his enemy,,in deadly combat; but&#xD;
not more impatient than was I as I lay prone&#xD;
upon the earth, awaiting the return of Gilmore.&#xD;
In moments and under circumstances like&#xD;
those, how inaction preys upon the heart, and.&#xD;
stings it into madness. How terrible.it is for&#xD;
the bold, daring man to lie'still, while the be-&#xD;
loved of his soul is in danger.&#xD;
To amuse myself I counted the birds as they&#xD;
flew over ; I watched the sun as it went on at a&#xD;
snail's pace, and wondered if some modern&#xD;
Joshua had not commanded it to stand still: I&#xD;
watched a limb, broken partly from the top of a&#xD;
sturdy sycamore, as it swayed to and fro with a&#xD;
mournful creaking sound, and asked my heart&#xD;
if it were not a requiem for Flora. I gazed at&#xD;
the clouds that floated across the skies, and&#xD;
thought that all human hopes were like them&#xD;
[saw the branches moving softly in the gentle&#xD;
breezes, and wished that no ruder winds might&#xD;
blow upon Flora.&#xD;
Had my life depended upon it, I could have&#xD;
lain there no longer. I sprang to my feet, 'hot&#xD;
and feverish, with impatience. .Iknew that an&#xD;
hour must have elapsed since Gilmore leffi e&#xD;
'['he position of the sun assured me that ,it.ust&#xD;
be so ; although it appeared like °the Iong&#xD;
hours to my anxious mind.&#xD;
I felt loth to leave the spot at once, so I&#xD;
paced back and forth a quarter of an hour long.&#xD;
er; as near as I could judge of' time.&#xD;

32                   BLACK RALPH&#xD;
&#xD;
I will follow him,' I said, mentally, if it be I&#xD;
to death. I will never forsake a brave man.'&#xD;
Though I felt uneasy at the stay of Gilmore,&#xD;
yet I did not really believe that any harm had&#xD;
befallen him  I knew him to be brave, cautious,&#xD;
intrepid, and more than a match for two Indians.&#xD;
I walked rapidly forward. When I had gone&#xD;
about a hundred and fifty yards, I found the&#xD;
river made an abrupt bend to the right. In-&#xD;
stead of following 'upoy the bank, I kept a&#xD;
straight onward course; I was soon made con-&#xD;
scious that I was in a dangerous neighborhood ;&#xD;
foV I saw the imprint of Indian feet, and beheld&#xD;
at a short distance the smoke -of many fires.&#xD;
My heart fluctuated between hope and fear-a&#xD;
hope that I was near Flora, a fear of the worst.&#xD;
I advanced with more caution.   With the&#xD;
power of a strong will, I hushed the tumultuous&#xD;
beatings of my pulse, grew  cooler, and firmer&#xD;
as I neared the place of danger.  I was soon&#xD;
near enough to hear the sound of savage merri-&#xD;
nerit ; -and finally to look down upon the fires&#xD;
of a large body of Cherokees..&#xD;
The cause of their fiendish exultation was&#xD;
soon apparent.  I beheld Gilmore lashed firm-&#xD;
ly to a tree, stripped to the skin,=while his cap-&#xD;
tors were 'busily piling fagots about him.&#xD;
My heart sank within me, and my brain&#xD;
grew dizzy with the sight. For a moment I&#xD;
leaned against a tree, for support, and fervently&#xD;
wished the earth might open  at my feet and&#xD;
receivee me.&#xD;
To save Gilmore semed impossible ; toleave&#xD;
'him seemed cruel; to stay and witness his tor-&#xD;
tures I could not  What then could I do? I&#xD;
could not go for assistance ; for before my re-&#xD;
turn the awful tragedy would be completed.&#xD;
But the savages appeared in no great hurry&#xD;
to dispatch their prisoner.  The faggots were&#xD;
not placed against him, but at-the distance of&#xD;
two paces, in order that his deathstruggle might&#xD;
edengthened out as much as possible.&#xD;
The trapper bore himself bravely ; as yet I&#xD;
had' heard im  utter no words eof complaint&#xD;
or entreaties fornmercy. I1 sawthim look wistfully&#xD;
at Two Shooter, as it leaned against a tree.&#xD;
&#xD;
Doubtless he thought of the many times it had}&#xD;
proved his friend, and longed for another oppor-&#xD;
tunity to face his foes with it.&#xD;
At a short distance from the trapper, I saw&#xD;
another scene.  Some savages vere howling bit- 1&#xD;
terly over the bodies of two of their warriors ;&#xD;
that was the work of Gilmore. In vain I look;&#xD;
ed for some signs of Flora ; I could see noth-&#xD;
ing of her.&#xD;
The preparations for torture were now com-&#xD;
pleted.  A horribly bedeviled savage taught a&#xD;
burning torch from the fire, and , deliberately&#xD;
placed it to the breast of Gilmore ; a dark itchy&#xD;
smoke curled upward.&#xD;
My temper could bear no more. I feltt every&#xD;
drop of blood boiling within me. Without a&#xD;
moment's hesitation I raised my rifle, took de-.&#xD;
liberate aim and fired. The exultant smile&#xD;
faded from the grim lips of the Cherokee ; and&#xD;
his tongue never uttered war-whoop more. He&#xD;
fell across the pile of faggots, and the burning&#xD;
torch fell blazing upon his own lifeless breast&#xD;
A smile of triumph flitted across the lips of&#xD;
Gilmiore, for he recognised the well- know;-&#xD;
crack of my rifle;. but that expression gav&#xD;
lace to one of alarm, and he cried out at th&#xD;
top of his voice.&#xD;
'Save yourself, Seward, for God's sake save&#xD;
yourself Care not for me.'&#xD;
The warning came too late, even had I been&#xD;
disposed to profit by it. Before a.'minute had&#xD;
elapsed, I was completely surrounded, and the-&#xD;
hope of escape cut off. I placed my back against&#xD;
a tree and fought desperately with my clubbed&#xD;
rifle. I prostrated several, and shot two with&#xD;
my pistol before11 was overpowered.  I was at&#xD;
length knocked down by a blow upon the head;&#xD;
but I made resistance even after I was down,&#xD;
fighting with my hunting knife, and dealing&#xD;
some fatal wounds.&#xD;
Human effort could do no more.. I was firmly&#xD;
secured and soon stood beside Gilmore, a can-&#xD;
didate for the same fate.  While I stood there&#xD;
sufeii the taunts and abuse of my captors,&#xD;
an Indian, who seemed to be wounded, slowly,&#xD;
and with much difficulty approached.&#xD;
&#xD;
TIE FORE.&#xD;
The moment my, eyes fell upon him, I fel&#xD;
my heart sinking within me, for it was the very&#xD;
same [ had lashed upon the horse, and sent&#xD;
flaming away, as I supposed, rpon the long rids&#xD;
of death. .The recognition was mutual.  A yel&#xD;
of unearthly triumph burst from  his lips, t&#xD;
shadow forth, if possible, some faint portion o&#xD;
the overpowering joy and triumph of the mo&#xD;
ment&#xD;
He advanced grinning, like a fiend, spat in&#xD;
my face, struck me upon the mouth and breast&#xD;
and expressed his malignity in various ways. ,He&#xD;
then turned to the others, talked a long time,&#xD;
pointing at me with frantic gestures. A long&#xD;
shout of approval followed his harangue, which&#xD;
was repeated, apparently by every squaw in&#xD;
the camp.&#xD;
'lHe's tellin' them about sunthin' you've&#xD;
done,' said Gilmore, 'the critters are gettin'&#xD;
oncommon savage. Our wanderin's together&#xD;
are putty nigh ended, and we shall go on our&#xD;
last journey together to-day.  But dont be&#xD;
down-hearted about it, my boy.; they can't make&#xD;
it last more nor a few hours at the most ; it's&#xD;
best to die game, and let the varmints know&#xD;
we've got some o' the- rale stuff in us.  You&#xD;
tipped the critter over handsum and no mistake;&#xD;
it did me good to see him go under in sich an&#xD;
onexpected manner; but I'm sorry for you, boy&#xD;
--sorry for you!l'&#xD;
'It can't be helped now, old friend,' I an-&#xD;
swered, ' As you say it will soon be all over ;&#xD;
and our ashes will be given to the winds to toy&#xD;
with.  Well, let it be so; it may be as well in&#xD;
the end, we can't die but once, and who knows&#xD;
but we may be better off&#xD;
. Gilmore turned his face inquiringly to mine.&#xD;
The light winds from the West played with the&#xD;
scattering grey hairs upon his temple ; a tear&#xD;
stood in each eye, but a faint smile was discerna-&#xD;
ble upon his lips.&#xD;
You talk like a brave man,' he said, and&#xD;
may God give you his blessin' as I do mine.&#xD;
We shalt have a hard time on't for the next few&#xD;
hours ; but I hope Heaven wont quite desart&#xD;
us, though we're but sinful. men at the best.&#xD;
Dont look at the critters ; they're preparin' their&#xD;

It worst tortures for you, and it will be terrible&#xD;
y for nothing' but flesh and blood to bear.'&#xD;
t    'I deserve it in some sort,' I replied, for I&#xD;
e have meted it out to others, and "now just Heav-&#xD;
I en returns it to me in full measure. I have&#xD;
o been a hard, passionate man, Gilmore, and I&#xD;
f am hardly fit to die; but I will strive to hear&#xD;
- it.  May God be more merciful than I have&#xD;
been.'&#xD;
' Even so, and the old trapper's prayer goes&#xD;
t with yours. Bat look, Seward, they're bringin'&#xD;
pitch-wood and splittin' it into small pikes ; I&#xD;
told you the devil was in them. Perhaps you&#xD;
don't know what them are for; but you'll know&#xD;
soon enough.'&#xD;
'They are to ornament our flesh with,' I re-&#xD;
plied.&#xD;
'May lightnin' blast them !' exclaimed Gil-&#xD;
more, 'They a going' to truss you up like a&#xD;
goose for a roast.'&#xD;
I was divested of clothing and bound to the&#xD;
tree to which Gilmore was lashed. The faggots&#xD;
which were already heaped, were removed a pace,&#xD;
farther from us, in order that our tortures might&#xD;
be protracted to the last moment.&#xD;
The Indian who had escaped the horrible&#xD;
death to which I had doomed him in the hour&#xD;
of my frantic madness, was most busy of all.&#xD;
The task of putting us to death, seemed by com-&#xD;
mon consent given into his hands.&#xD;
He ordered everything-the arrangements of&#xD;
the dry sticks-the manner of securing us-&#xD;
the preparing of the inflamable wood, and in&#xD;
short the exact mode in which the infernal rites&#xD;
should proceed.  lie was careful that the Pitch-&#xD;
pine should b properly split, of the best quali-&#xD;
ty, and abtindatit in quantity.' I served with&#xD;
a shuddtibat several fires were to delighted,&#xD;
before the erdrionies would be ended; and our&#xD;
sufferings cease ,&#xD;
The indians iow formed"a circle around us,&#xD;
and the death dance commenced. Even now a&#xD;
horrible faintness creeps over me whna  I recall&#xD;
that scene.-&#xD;
The air was rent with yelle, which fournds a&#xD;
thousand distant echoes amid the surrondn&#xD;
hills.                                 in&#xD;

84                    BLACK RALPH&#xD;
&#xD;
The women and children caught up the bur-&#xD;
den of that satanic song of triumph, and made&#xD;
it many times more dreadful.&#xD;
Who can describe such orgies?  No person&#xD;
living ; it surpasses the power of human de-&#xD;
scription.  They leaped about like drunken&#xD;
devils; they threw themselves into all manner&#xD;
of uncouth shapes; they gnashed their teeth, and&#xD;
foamed at the mouth. Then a warrior would&#xD;
dance up to us' tell us what he had done, and&#xD;
what he would do, call us cowards, squaws,shake&#xD;
his hatchet in our faces, and retire greatly sat-&#xD;
isfied with what he had done ; and so the rites&#xD;
proceeded.&#xD;
At length all was ready for the torture. The&#xD;
same savage that 1 have before called attention,&#xD;
to, approached me with his hunting knife.&#xD;
'White men die like women,' he said, in his&#xD;
own tongue. ' They have no courage ; but In-&#xD;
dians die like men.'&#xD;
Another Indian followed, bearing a bundle of&#xD;
inflarablo wood. The savage grasped my left&#xD;
arm with his thumb and fingers and raised the&#xD;
:skin; looking steadily into my eyes to see if I&#xD;
inched, he thrust his knife slowly through that&#xD;
portion which he held. The pain of the inflic-&#xD;
tion was considerable, but I uttered no cry.&#xD;
Through the opening which he had made in my&#xD;
flesh, with no gentle hand, he forced one of&#xD;
the pieces of piteh-wood.&#xD;
The savage'spectators shouted in concert, and&#xD;
the operator proceeded with his work.&#xD;
I shut my eyes and commended myself to&#xD;
While he was inserting the knife for the third&#xD;
time into my arm, I heard a yell of consterna-&#xD;
tion from the Indians,and opening my eyes in sur-&#xD;
prise, beheld them flying in all directions, while&#xD;
one of their number lay dead, apparently, within&#xD;
the area of the" circle.&#xD;
I have alluded casually to an abrupt bend in&#xD;
the river ; at it swept back again to resume its&#xD;
general direction, it passed between two mighty,&#xD;
ledges, some fifty feet high, which arched over&#xD;
until they nearly spanned it like a bridge, form-&#xD;
ing a frightful chasm about .fifteen feet wide at&#xD;
the top, and the width of the streamn below.&#xD;
&#xD;
Directly over this abyss, through which the&#xD;
waters went roaring and tumbling-and casting&#xD;
up foam, I beheld in mid-air, a horse and rider&#xD;
of gigantic size. It was but a moment that I&#xD;
beheld them, for the twain flew over the chasm&#xD;
and landed safely upon the other side, before&#xD;
my lips could utter an exclamation of astonish-&#xD;
ment. It was right gallantly achieved, and&#xD;
when my tongue found its use ; I shouted mad-&#xD;
ly in the excess of my admiration ; and Gil-&#xD;
more's stentorian voice arose in concert with&#xD;
mine. [sEE FRoNTIsPIECE].&#xD;
The Indians were seized with a sudden panic;&#xD;
when I turned my eyes to where I had last&#xD;
seen them, not one was in sight, save him who&#xD;
had fallen.&#xD;
'Tis Black Ralph,' said Gilmore, 'and he&#xD;
rides as though God had sent him express. Did&#xD;
you obsarve how the varmints run, crying Ma-&#xD;
chinito, Machinito!'&#xD;

head upon his knees.&#xD;
'The critter has vamished,' he said, with a&#xD;
solemn shake of the head. 'He went jest as he&#xD;
come, and we dont know no more of Black Ralph&#xD;
than afore. There's a heap of mystery about&#xD;
it, and I hav'nt got no philosophy to account&#xD;

Did he say nothing'? IJasked.&#xD;
'Not so much as a word. He pointed with&#xD;

erance from a cruel death.                  nature arose within to road me to acts of retal-&#xD;
&#xD;
We had gone but a few paces when a thought&#xD;
suggested itself to me. I seized a= burning&#xD;
brand from a fire, hurried back and applied it to&#xD;
all the lodges successively.&#xD;
'Good,' said Gilmore. 'We'll do the critters&#xD;
all the mischief we can.'&#xD;
Saying this, he gathered up all the guns,&#xD;
rifles,. and other things of value which the sava-&#xD;
ges had left, and threw them far out into the&#xD;
river.&#xD;
The last. we saw   of the encampment, the&#xD;
lodges were burning splendidly, sending up&#xD;
long columrns of red flame.&#xD;
'Now,' said Gilmore, 'we niust away in that&#xD;
direction, and cross the other trail. One terri-&#xD;
ble danger has passed ; and God is merciful,&#xD;
but there's more jest, afore us.  Black Ralph&#xD;
has proved our:friend this time, but I should a&#xD;

AsI followed the swift footsteps of the trap-&#xD;
per, I half forget the danger that environed us,&#xD;
&#xD;
iation and vengeance.&#xD;
The pain of my arm added not a little to my&#xD;
savage mood. I vowed death to every red man&#xD;
who should come within my reach. Such was&#xD;
the resolution I formed as I went forward.&#xD;

Gilmore and Buston passed; in doing so I did&#xD;
not observe due caution, for the way was'ex-&#xD;
tremely rough, and seamed with wide, rocky&#xD;
chasms. Making an unlucky step, I fell. I knew&#xD;
-no more, for some time. Upon opening my&#xD;
eyes, I found myself lying at the bottom of one&#xD;
of the chasms I have named. My temples&#xD;
were bleeding and so wa's my wounded arm&#xD;
and hand. Still somewhat bewildered, I arose,&#xD;
and with some exertion reached the stream for&#xD;
which I had started.&#xD;
Sitting down on its sloping bank, I bathed&#xD;
my hand and arm in its cooling waters. I&#xD;
then drank freely of the same and felt much&#xD;
revived.&#xD;
'What's the matter ?' said a voice near me.&#xD;

seemed to affect him n9t a little.&#xD;
Captured by the Indians, did you say?'&#xD;
* And carried I know not whither,' I an..&#xD;
weed.&#xD;
For a few seconds the stranger looked ear-&#xD;
nestl$ into my face as if to read my thoughts.&#xD;
'And you are resolved to rescue her,' he&#xD;
said, at length.&#xD;
'Or die in the attempt,' I added.&#xD;
An expression that did not please me passed&#xD;
over the face of the man before me.&#xD;
°  ulove this Flora Dale, perhaps?' he re-&#xD;
' I said no t that I loved the maiden,' I re-&#xD;
turned, drily.1&#xD;
ah"i isnot necessary that you should say so;&#xD;
ca read it uoiyour face every time you&#xD;
&#xD;
Well, take it for granted, 'that I .love her,&#xD;
or do not love her, just as seems good to you.&#xD;
It makes little difference.'&#xD;
'On the contrary it makes all the difference&#xD;
in the world. Look at me a moment.'&#xD;
.I see you.'&#xD;
Do I not look like a match for you in your&#xD;
present wounded and bruised condition ?' he&#xD;
asked, curling his nether lip contemptuously.&#xD;
'I fear no man, large or, small,' IL answered,&#xD;
wondering what all this could tend to.&#xD;
'You perceive that I am a man in stature, I&#xD;
presume ?'  ,&#xD;
'Tall enough to trim the Northern Lights, I&#xD;
should think,' I replied.&#xD;
'You take it pleasantly, but it will be seri-&#xD;
ous enough by-and-by. Look at my face.'&#xD;
- The stranger paused, and a - most forbiding&#xD;
scowl appeared upon his brows, while the whole&#xD;
expression of his face was sinister in the ex-&#xD;
treme.&#xD;
'Not a very prepossessing visage certainly;&#xD;
it will probably hang you one of these days.'&#xD;
'Very good ; according to your own; show-&#xD;
ing I am one not to be trifled with, and so you&#xD;
will find it. I love Flora Dale.'&#xD;
'You!' I exclaimed contemptuously.&#xD;
'Yes, J!'&#xD;
'I must say there's but a poor chance for&#xD;
you, if I have seen the best side of your face,'&#xD;
I replied, laughing.  'No christian woman will&#xD;
ever fancy such a figure as yours.'&#xD;
'I have made a solemn vow that, Flora Dale&#xD;
shall be no wife unless she be wife of mine, and&#xD;
it is registered in  - '&#xD;
'Hell,' I added.&#xD;
'I was going to say Heaven, but if it will&#xD;
please you better, I will alter it and say that&#xD;
my vow is registered in hell. Little difference&#xD;
will it make to me where it  registered.'&#xD;
' Youare an arrant scoundrel ! I'retorted,&#xD;
growing hot with passion.&#xD;
'Fool!'&#xD;
Boastinmiserable coward! How dare&#xD;
you speak the name of Flora.'     h     t,&#xD;
ecried,in evoice of thunder. 'It needs bt a&#xD;
&#xD;
word more to make me trample the breath from&#xD;
your body, and give your carcase to the wolves.'&#xD;
' Cease your prating!' I exclaimed, in a&#xD;
voice as terrible as his.own. ' Cease, or T shall&#xD;
forget that it is wicked to do murder. You&#xD;
speak of not knowing you; God in Heaven ! if&#xD;
you knew but half of what I am capable of do-&#xD;
ing, your six feet and a half of bone and mus-&#xD;
ele would shake like the leaves of yonder as-&#xD;
pen.&#xD;
In the anger of the moment I had forgotten&#xD;
my wounds, my bruises, my weakness, and felt&#xD;
within me all the strength which my fiercest&#xD;
mood always inspires.&#xD;
'Listen to the conditions I offer,' said the&#xD;
stranger, after a short pause, in which he ap-&#xD;
peared to be struggling with himself for some-&#xD;
thing like composure.  'Mount your horse, if&#xD;
you have one, lash your rifle upon your back,&#xD;
and leave this country forever ; do this, and I&#xD;
swear I will not harm a hair of your head.'&#xD;
Well, what if I do not choose to comply?'&#xD;
Ig you are fool enough to stay, I will not&#xD;
promise you a week's probation upon the face&#xD;
of the earth ; I swear it.'&#xD;
'Damnable villain ! get out of my path, or I&#xD;
shall not be able to control myself. To my&#xD;
other crimes will be added the crime of murder.&#xD;
Begone I say! 1begonel'&#xD;
These words fell from my white lips in tones&#xD;
of thunder. The ruffian recoiled a step in sur-&#xD;
prise.,&#xD;
'Mistaken idiot ; do you suppose for an in.&#xD;
stant that I can be daunted.   A  thousand&#xD;
wretches like you could not shake my soul with&#xD;
terror. Ask the winds to pause in their flight&#xD;
and listen to you, and they will do your will as&#xD;
soon.'&#xD;
'Hold !' shouted the stranger, in a voice&#xD;
thick-with passion, 'or by my soul's salvation,&#xD;
Will beat'you with rods as a. man beats his&#xD;
dog; and afterwards I will tell Flora Dale what&#xD;
I have done.'&#xD;
I made no reply ; I- waited no longer ; the&#xD;
evil aemon of my nature was in the ascendant.&#xD;
I leaped upon the boasting ruffian with more&#xD;
ferocity than ever- famishing tiger pounced up-&#xD;
&#xD;
on its prey. He was borne to the earth in an&#xD;
instant of times--quicker, if that were possible.&#xD;
With the fingers of my right hand I clutehed&#xD;
his throat like a vice. Tighter grew my grasp.&#xD;
His eyes started from their sockets ; his tongue&#xD;
protruded from his purple Wpa, while his whole.&#xD;
system was shaken by convulsive throes. Gradu-&#xD;
ally the struggle ceased. The chest ceased its.&#xD;
motions; the limbs grew passive.&#xD;
I dragged the body to the stream and threw&#xD;
it in. The water was not deep enough to cover&#xD;
it ; and it lay with its face upward, unmoved.&#xD;
Vain boaster!' I exclaimed, ' where now&#xD;
is your six feet of flesh and bone?'&#xD;
I gazed at it for a brief moment, as it lay&#xD;
there in the waters ; then, taking up my rifle,&#xD;
turned hastily away.&#xD;
The sun kept shining, and the birds sang on,&#xD;
as though no murder had been done. The&#xD;
winds and the waters murmured together ; but&#xD;
their pleasant sound was gone. The wilderness&#xD;
seemed to smile in sunlight, as an hour ago;-&#xD;
but it smiled not for me.&#xD;
I thought of Flora ; but now her name was&#xD;
linked to the remembrance of a crime. I walked&#xD;
on faster and faster ; but I could npt walk away&#xD;
from that which seemed like a heavy burden;&#xD;
growing heavier and heavier.&#xD;
My eyes caught glimpses of an object tha&#xD;
flitted from tree to tree, like a spectre. What&#xD;
could- it be ?  Was it the ghost of the murdered&#xD;
man ?  Was it an optical delusion?  I strode&#xD;
boldly toward the spot to see if my imaginati9&#xD;
was indeed playing tricks with me. I saw it&#xD;
again, and it moved away like a frighten*4&#xD;
creature ; it was the figure of a female.&#xD;
Always ready to obey the dictates of the mo-&#xD;
ment, I followed the form; but as it saw itself&#xD;
the object of pursuit,"it quickened its flight ani&#xD;
flew over the ground like a wounded bird urging&#xD;
itself forward by the assistance of its injuredd&#xD;
wings. I ran as fast as I was able. Like;the&#xD;
timid hare ; like the light footed, deer;like&#xD;
every wild thing that flies fromiorse and rid r&#xD;
and hound, so fled the figure..&#xD;
The ,distance shortened between u,&#xD;
flying one heard my footsteps, an&amp;amp; without$t~&#xD;

&#xD;
ing a glance behind, fell senseless to the ground.&#xD;
I bent over her-raised her-looked intoher&#xD;
face ; it was Floral/     .&#xD;
I lifted her softly from the earth, laid her&#xD;
earefully,'gently, upon my bosom, and bore her&#xD;
towards the runnin water.&#xD;
Though I held in my arms all that I loved in&#xD;
the World, I gazed upon her with no unhallowed&#xD;
eye. I feared to touch her too rudely-I did&#xD;
dot desecrate with mfr lips the pale cheek so&#xD;
neat ny own-for my hands were stained with&#xD;
a new erime.&#xD;
Though I had left the brook some distance&#xD;
behind,,I was not long in regaining it, and roy&#xD;
burden did not weary me.-&#xD;
Her swoon was long and death-like ; but I'&#xD;
had the pleasure of seeing her open her eyes at&#xD;
last. She looked timidly in my face, shudder-&#xD;
ed, and closed them"again.&#xD;
'Floral' I said, softly.&#xD;
The full, dark orbs were again fixed upon me,&#xD;
but this time with an exclamation of joyful&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
Flora, you are safe. One is with you who&#xD;
wonld give his life to save yours,'I added.&#xD;
A sweet"smile flitted over the pale lips of&#xD;
Flora Dale.&#xD;
O, sir, say again that I am safe,' she said,&#xD;
with an afibrt.&#xD;
A"thousand tines, Flora, if itwill please&#xD;
you,' I answered.&#xD;
She made no reply, but covering her face&#xD;
With her hands, wept freely.&#xD;
Let your heart be strong, Flora. By the&#xD;
good assistance of Heaven, you shall soon be *re-&#xD;
stored to the armns of your friends,' I added. -&#xD;
She now seemed to be conscious for the first&#xD;
tie; that she was lying in my' arms. She&#xD;
itlf disengaged herself, blushing as she did&#xD;
Wherehave you been?   What is your his-&#xD;
tory?'Have you suffered ? I asked.&#xD;
' You ask many questions at once,' she. an-&#xD;
swered, with smile.  ' I have/been with those&#xD;
Liked not ; my history is short; and I have&#xD;
8tird But' you ee that I have escaped,&#xD;
an tthankeGod.'&#xD;
&#xD;
'Go it, Catridge-Box !' said a voice, and be.&#xD;
fore I had time to turn, Two Forty leaped the&#xD;
brook, and stood panting before us, with his&#xD;
master sitting in the saddle.&#xD;
'You're a mighty queer chap,' said Buston.&#xD;
'You're setting' here as contented as a saint,&#xD;
while we've; been racing-arter you for the last&#xD;
hour. Mother of the pilgrims ! but it's a gal&#xD;
you've picked up I It's posserbly one o' the&#xD;
'babes in the woods' grown to womanhood. My&#xD;
eye !  She's not a bad lookin' piece o' human&#xD;
flesh. She looks about as nice for a gal as Two&#xD;
Forty does for a 'hoss.'&#xD;
Flora reddened to the eyes. I was about to&#xD;
reprove the hunter for the liberty he had taken,&#xD;
when she stopped me by a motion of the hand,&#xD;
saying :&#xD;
He,- means well. Suffer him to have his&#xD;
way.&#xD;
'This is Miss Dale, the young woman we&#xD;
were seeking, I said, turning to Buston.&#xD;
'And you've rescued her all alone !  That&#xD;
warn't fair, by no means.'&#xD;
No, I can't take to myself such credit. By&#xD;
some means 'she escaped from her captors with.&#xD;
out my help.'&#xD;
And you mean to say that you found her&#xD;
here in the woods arter she had got away from&#xD;
the Ingins?'&#xD;
- Exactly.'&#xD;
'There must be some magnetism about that.&#xD;
It's mighty strange that two young creturs should&#xD;
find each other in this great country without&#xD;
chart or compass.- But it can't be helped now,&#xD;
though I slpould a liked to have had a brush&#xD;
with the varmints. I believe I could fight like&#xD;
a regerler hound for sich a nice, young female.'&#xD;
' There may be a chance for you yet,'- said&#xD;
Flora, smiling pleasantly upon the trapper.&#xD;
'Yes, very true, marm: the creturs may catch&#xD;
you again.I But I Can be of sarvice to you yet ;&#xD;
you shall ride Two Forty, and he's the best hose&#xD;
living.&#xD;
'I thank you, I am sure,' replied Flora.,&#xD;
'Two Forty, you scoundrel! make your man-&#xD;
ners to t1 uncommon cretur.'&#xD;
Th~e iana obeyed as well as he was able&#xD;
to do.&#xD;
&#xD;
'Nowkneel to her jest as I would if I was a&#xD;
young man like that chap.'&#xD;
Two Forty kneeled very gracefully, ,and&#xD;
Flora, laughing, patted him upon ;the neck.&#xD;
I've, e'enamost forgot the signal I was to&#xD;
give if I found you,' said Buston, and putting&#xD;
his hand to his mouth, he gave a shrill kind of&#xD;
whistle, which was-instantly answered.&#xD;
Gilnore was soon seen approaching us.&#xD;
'Stir your stumps, old Two-Shooter! this&#xD;
young chap has taken a prisoner!'&#xD;
'Two-Shooter, I'd thank you to remember is&#xD;
the name of my shootin'-irona; but where's the&#xD;
prisoner?' returned the trapper.&#xD;
' That's her !' replied Buston, with a corni-&#xD;
cal leer.&#xD;
'Flora Dale, as I'm an old sinner !  How in&#xD;
the name o' natur did it happen ?'&#xD;
What the reader already knows in relation to&#xD;
the subject, was soon related.'&#xD;
Flora then mounted Two Forty, and we moved&#xD;
away as fast as we could. It was 'a relief to me&#xD;
to leave the spot, and I was truly glad when I&#xD;
could hear no longer the murmur of the brook&#xD;
where the body of my rival lay..&#xD;
It was a little past noon when we  halted in a&#xD;
pleasant ravine.  Gilmore and myself kindled a&#xD;
fire, while Buston went forth to kill a deer.&#xD;
When this task was completed, I seated my.&#xD;
self by the side of Plora.&#xD;
"This is a quiet, secluded spot,' she remark.&#xD;
ed.&#xD;
I could almost wish to live here,' I replied.&#xD;
'What ! and turn hermit ?'&#xD;
O no; I should want a companion. Flora&#xD;
Dale would suit me best,' I answered, gaily.&#xD;
See how rank the wild sage grows on yonder1&#xD;
bill-side,' she said, without heeding my last re-&#xD;
'mark.&#xD;
'How should you like living here, Flora ?'&#xD;
O  very well, if the Indians would keep&#xD;
away.'&#xD;
You would prefer to be alone, probably ?'&#xD;
By no means. I should want all my friends f&#xD;
with me, and Two Forty to ride.'&#xD;
'Youh tave not told mt 'your adventures yet,&#xD;
Mias Dale ?'&#xD;
&#xD;
'That is the first time you have called me&#xD;
lis Dale to-day.'&#xD;
'I beg your pardon.'&#xD;
Granted, of course I for I prefer Flora to&#xD;
all other names.&#xD;
'So do I.'&#xD;
'Something dies ! i heard tlIecrack oft the&#xD;
hunter's rifle.'&#xD;
"You have not yet fold me how you were&#xD;
taken by the savages ?'&#xD;
'There, is but little to relate ; I will tell you&#xD;
now. Previous to your arrival with Arthur we&#xD;
had been so much harrassed     e Indians that-&#xD;
I had not walked as much as nual in the open&#xD;
air. -After your coming-the next day-I felt&#xD;
inclined to take the fresh air that breathes through&#xD;
the forest, near the settlem t. The idea of&#xD;
danger did not occur to me. ' he joy I experi-&#xD;
eneed in seeing Arthur once more banished such&#xD;
th ughts. Thewoods had never looked so green;&#xD;
the brook had never murmured so merrily-; the&#xD;
wild flowers never looked half so inviting; the&#xD;
birds never sang more sweetly; the breezes&#xD;
never sighed so softly in my ear.&#xD;
My heart beat in unison with all things about&#xD;
me as I walked slowly on. I sang and gathered&#xD;
flowers as I went. I was thinking about Arthur,&#xD;
and what a fine looking youth he had grown to&#xD;
be, when a hand was laid rudely upon  my arni,&#xD;
and another upon my mouth. I would havh&#xD;
cried out for help ; but no sound passed ny lips.&#xD;
I was in the power of savages. Mylterror, it is&#xD;
impossible.'to describe ;'for the thought of an&#xD;
Indian was always terrible to me. Could make&#xD;
but feeble 'resistance. I was lifted 'upon the&#xD;
back of a 'horse whose feet were co'verrd with&#xD;
buffalo skin, that his steps might leave no trask&#xD;
to indicate the way I had gone.&#xD;
My captors were six in number.   One took&#xD;
the horse by the 'bridle, while another ran&#xD;
along by my side, the' others coming after&#xD;
in single file. The smoothest and best ways&#xD;
were chosen, and I was conducted rapidly away&#xD;
frdm the settlement. My captors premed for-&#xD;
ward all night without stopping    readfli&#xD;
night ! weary and painful houirs! A shooter&#xD;
was made in the morning. Food was efferel&#xD;

&#xD;
me, but you may readily suppose I refused it.&#xD;
I was again placed upon the herse, and we went s&#xD;
on as before.                               t&#xD;
We .had gone but a short distance, when, I&#xD;
greatly to my surprise, as you may imagine, s&#xD;
we were jgin     by a white man. I recog- t&#xD;
nizqd him at olce as one of our settlers, suppos- l&#xD;
ed to have bee'nkilled by the Indians some weeks&#xD;
previously.  My heart grew heavier still; for I I&#xD;
had reason to remember shim.'&#xD;
'Was he a tall man?' -I asked, eagerly.   I&#xD;
He was of uncommon stature,' she; replied.&#xD;
Excuse th       uption.  Please go on, Flo- &#xD;
ra' I added, quie ly.&#xD;
He had been one not greatly beloved by the&#xD;
other emigrants, and his reputation as an honestI&#xD;
man was far froth enviable. He was usually call-1&#xD;
*ed Osborne : wt other name he might have&#xD;
passed by while among us, I know not. What-&#xD;
ever faintly lingering hope of escape I might&#xD;
hitherto have cherished, left me when I saw him&#xD;
approaching.&#xD;
Cease to tremble,' he said. .'Your life is&#xD;
not in danger. A word from me sets you at lib-&#xD;
erty.'&#xD;
'Then speak that word, that I may return to&#xD;
my father,' I answered.&#xD;
'Not so fast, it takes two to make a bargain.&#xD;
There are certain conditions to be observed be-&#xD;
fore I give you your freedom.'&#xD;
' Those creatures are employed by you then,'&#xD;
~I answered.&#xD;
'I shall deny nothing,' he replied.  ' But I&#xD;
will come te the point at once.&#xD;
Flora paused, overcome by her emotions.&#xD;
Spare yourself the pain of telling me the&#xD;
nature of the conditions he imposed,' I said.&#xD;
Thank you I' she 'answered, recovering her&#xD;
self-possession., ' Suflice 'it that I rejected his&#xD;
offers with scorn and indignation. . I was tor-&#xD;
tured with his presence during the long hours of&#xD;
that day. He menaced and entreated by turns;&#xD;
but the wife; of such a man, who could be?&#xD;
At Right we encamped.  An Indian lodgewas&#xD;
prepared for an to sleep -in ; while Osborne&#xD;
watched at the door, and 4he savages slept near&#xD;
it. I la'ud, down upon the rudp couch prepared&#xD;
for me and feigned leep.&#xD;
&#xD;
I knew but too well that I could not long be&#xD;
afe in the power of such aman, and resolved&#xD;
o attempt'a escape. The lodge was built part-&#xD;
y of skins, arranged as you have often seen. I&#xD;
succeeded in detaching one of these from its fas-&#xD;
enings  'I stood in the open air, without the&#xD;
odge, and saw no one to oppose my flight.&#xD;
Like one who flies from despair and death ;&#xD;
ike one who flies from all that is dreadful on&#xD;
earth ; like one whose only hope is in flight, I&#xD;
ran from the scene of my thraldoni.&#xD;
But I glided away cautiously at first, and my&#xD;
footsteps sent back no sound to betray me.&#xD;
What joy filled my heart as I threaded the&#xD;
dark and lonely wilderness. I had escaped dis-&#xD;
honor-I had baffled a bad man. Yet dreary&#xD;
was the prospect before me ; for I might wander&#xD;
many dcays without meeting a human being to&#xD;
aid me;and I might perish for want of food.&#xD;
But thoughts like these did not trouble me at&#xD;
that time. I thoughtof, and only dreaded pur-&#xD;
suit. I kept on and on; the dreary night roll-&#xD;
ed away, and, the light of another.morning shone&#xD;
upon me. More than once I imagined I heard&#xD;
footsteps and was pursued. When I ran from&#xD;
you, I supposed I was flying from  Osborne ;&#xD;
hence my terror. What followed is known bet-&#xD;
ter to you than to myself; for terror had nearly&#xD;
driven me mad. I most earnestly pray that I&#xD;
may never see the face of Osborne again.',&#xD;
'Your prayer is answered,' I replied. ..You&#xD;
need not fear him more-he is but dust and&#xD;
ashes.'&#xD;
'What do I hear,' she exclaimed, struck by&#xD;
the solemn manner in which I had spoken.&#xD;
'The man you have called Oshrne will nev-&#xD;
er harm so much as a hair of your head,, Flora,'&#xD;
I answered.&#xD;
Is he dead-have you slain him?'&#xD;
'Do not question me. Suffer me to forget;&#xD;
or to emember that justice only has been done.'&#xD;
'Your wordsinspire me with the conscious-&#xD;
ness of something terrible. God preserve us&#xD;
ll.&#xD;
'Pray often; Flora,' I answered. ' The prayr&#xD;
of the innocent are acceptable to God; andt&#xD;
when you address the Throne of Mercy, if you&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
should remember my name, and say 'God keep&#xD;
him,' it might be better for me in the last day.'&#xD;
'Go it, old Cutridge-Box !' said a voice near&#xD;
us. Looking up, we perceived the eccentric hun-&#xD;
ter approaching, leading Two Forty by the bri-&#xD;
die, bringing a good supply of venison. Nor&#xD;
was this all; near him were Arthur Dale and&#xD;
his father, accompanied by an Indian.&#xD;
With an exclamation of delight, Flora ran to&#xD;
meet her dearest earthly friends.&#xD;
'I thank the protecting hand of God for this&#xD;
deliverance!' said the old man, in a tremulous&#xD;
voice, as he embraced Flora and kissed her.&#xD;
' To have lost thee would have brought my&#xD;
grey hairs in sorrow to the grave, even as said&#xD;
one of old. But He tempers the wind to the&#xD;
shorn lamb. He breaketh not the bruised reed.&#xD;
A sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his:&#xD;
notice.'&#xD;
How I envied Arthur the pleasure of press-&#xD;
ing her so lovingly to his heart ; but it was the&#xD;
dear right of a brother.&#xD;
The father of Flora took my hand in his.&#xD;
'I would thank you if I could, young man,&#xD;
for-the assistance you have rendered ; but I feel&#xD;
myself incapable of doing so. Imagine, that I&#xD;
have said much, and receive an old man's bles-&#xD;
sing. There is Flora; she must say to you what&#xD;
I feel, but cannot express.''&#xD;
'Go it, old feller!' said Buston, in a low voice,&#xD;
gsit's reasonable and just.'&#xD;
"" 'The consciousness of having served Flora&#xD;
Dale, renders me sufficiently happy, and you&#xD;
owe me no gratitude,' I answered.&#xD;
Arthur shook me warmly by the hand.&#xD;
'Two Forty is every inch a hoss!' added Bus-&#xD;
ton, slipping the bridle from the head of the an-&#xD;
imal in question.&#xD;
'I like him,' said Flora.&#xD;
,W' lie's the only hoss this side the Rocky&#xD;
Mountains, fit to carry sich an oncommon ere-&#xD;
tir.'&#xD;
The hunter paused,-and then turning to!Gil-&#xD;
more, slapped him good naturedly on the shoul-&#xD;
der, saying :&#xD;
.' Don't you wish you was younger, Old Ram-&#xD;
rod?'&#xD;
&#xD;
'Ramrod isn't no part of my name,' replied&#xD;
the trapper drily.&#xD;
'Two Forty's a hoss, and Flory's an oncom-&#xD;
mon cretur ! them's my sentiments, and if any-&#xD;
body wants to fight on that pertickerlar subjeck,&#xD;
I'm ready.'&#xD;
But no person seemed disposed to take up the&#xD;
gauntlet.&#xD;
.During this time the Indian referred to had&#xD;
stood at a short distance in dignified silence.-&#xD;
He was truly a noble looking savage, and I&#xD;
could not help observing him closely.&#xD;
'Well, Bust-your-Biler, what kind of a spec-&#xD;
imen of red human natar have you got there?'&#xD;
asked Gilmore, pointing toward the Indian.&#xD;
That's a eretur I fell in with while I was&#xD;
gone,' he replied, and approaching the stranger&#xD;
Indian, he struck him upon the shouldering his&#xD;
own familiar style.&#xD;
The red man turned upon Buston with an in-&#xD;
dignant curl of the nether lip.&#xD;
But the rattle-brained hunter was not abash-&#xD;
ed ; nothing could abash him for a moment.&#xD;
'How fare ye, Redskin ? Can you repeat the&#xD;
catechism! do. you know the Lord's Prayer? are&#xD;
you in a state of grace 2  Do you know whiskey&#xD;
from bad rum?'&#xD;
The Indian shook his head and made no re-&#xD;
ply.&#xD;
'Deaf as a gate-post, and in a complete state&#xD;
o' natur!'&#xD;
The stately savage remained silent.&#xD;
'Perhaps you're Chenango, the last of the&#xD;
Big.Reds, and don't like to speak to common&#xD;
people 'C&#xD;
Still there was no reply.&#xD;
' Come here, old Brass Eyes, and see if you&#xD;
can make him understand !' continued Buston,&#xD;
turning to Gilmore.&#xD;
: ' My nanue doesn't begin with Brass Eyes, in&#xD;

Buston now addressed the Indian in a toague&#xD;
which I could not understand a word of, and the&#xD;
latter replied in the same language.&#xD;
' .'He tells me he lives thear the Great Salt&#xD;

'The iPah-Utahs are found up in that region,'&#xD;
Gilmore remarked.&#xD;
'And they're a dangerous set o' Red skins,&#xD;
take 'em together,' replied the hunter. 'But&#xD;
this cretur is an exception, for he come to me in&#xD;
a very civil sort of way while I was cuttin' up&#xD;
the deer I had killed. Two Forty snuffed the&#xD;
air, and grew restless, and I knew there was&#xD;
sunthin' about that be did'nt fancy. I looked&#xD;
up and saw this varmint coming' towards me.&#xD;
' Mind what you're about, Copper Face!' said'&#xD;
T, catchin' up my rifle ; but the cretur laid his&#xD;
hand upon his heart to signify that no hurt was&#xD;
intended. 1 spoke to him in several kinds of&#xD;
lngin, and we soon come to an understandin'.&#xD;
He said he was a great friend to the pale faces,&#xD;
and had been to Westport'all alone to see 'em.'&#xD;
' He's a noble looking fellow,' said Dale.&#xD;
'There's one deadly sin recorded against&#xD;
him,' I answered.&#xD;
*'What is it?' asked Dale.&#xD;
'It is the unpardonable sin of a Red skin,' I&#xD;
replied.&#xD;
A'Are you really in earnest ?'&#xD;
'I never was more in earnest !'&#xD;
'What is the cause of your antipathy ?'&#xD;
I cannot tell you; I think it must be con-&#xD;
stitutional.'&#xD;
'It's very singular,' said Dale, 'but I confess&#xD;
that I have the same aversion, and cannot con-r&#xD;
quer it.'&#xD;
' Gentlemen, parmit me to introduce to your&#xD;
partickeler attention, Brass Eyes, the last of the&#xD;
Long Reds,' said Buston, with that peculiarly&#xD;
comic expression wlich characterized all he&#xD;
did.&#xD;
Don't be a foolin' with the critter,' said&#xD;
Gilmore.  'The varmint's proud, and doi't like&#xD;
to be talked about too freely;'&#xD;
The trapper now addressed a few words to&#xD;
him:in the Indian tongue ; he then informed us&#xD;
that he was. a Utah Chief,.with a. long name,&#xD;
which, being interpreted into our language,&#xD;
means 'War Path.'&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER          VIII.&#xD;
THE DECLARATION.&#xD;
WILL;not dwell upon the details of our&#xD;
return to the settlement. It will be suffi-&#xD;
eient to sqy that we reached- it without ae-&#xD;
cident. In the society of Flora,,the days passed&#xD;
pleasantly. . The more intimately I became ao-&#xD;
quainted with her, the more I saw to admire in&#xD;
her character.&#xD;
On the subject of love, my lips had been-si-&#xD;
lent. Ieared to tell her my passion. I wish-&#xD;
ed that the sweet illusion, if illusion it indee4&#xD;
were, might last, nor be dispelled too soon.&#xD;
Since our return, the Indians had been guilty&#xD;
of no inroads upon the.settlers. All had been&#xD;
quiet. Gilmore and Buston vied with each&#xD;
other in story telling, and we listened to, them&#xD;
many evenings. Very many things were rela-&#xD;
ted which I am sadly afraid never happened.&#xD;
' Perhaps you never saw adog ?' said Buston,&#xD;
on one occasion, 'though I am happy to say&#xD;
you've seen a hoss. 4 number of. years ago,&#xD;
I had the good luck to own a generwine dog.---&#xD;
None e' your low bred common curs was Lion.&#xD;
He come of a good family, and his airly eddi-&#xD;
cation warn't neglected. He was'nt very large;&#xD;
on there contrary, he was quite small. To look at&#xD;
him, you would'nt think him no more nor a com-&#xD;
mon dog, because you could'nt see none o' his&#xD;
good qualities.'&#xD;
'What could he do?' asked Gilmore, rather-&#xD;
contemptuously.&#xD;
He could run,' replied Buston.&#xD;
'When he happened to see anything' bigger&#xD;
nor himself ! I s'pose,'. added the trapper, in a&#xD;
low tone of voice.&#xD;
'There was nothin' could beat him at 4, dead&#xD;
run, He could catch a deer, or a buffalo, or&#xD;
antelope, afore they had run fifty rods.'&#xD;
'An antelope!' said Gilmore, with a shrug&#xD;
of the shoulders.&#xD;
'There was'nt nothin' that he could'nt catch,'&#xD;
continued Buston.  'I've known him to out-&#xD;
run the wind, on a prairie, many a time. He&#xD;
&#xD;
travelled on one occasion from Fort Walla Wal-&#xD;
la to Westport, and back agin in two days, and&#xD;
carried a letter, waited for an answer, and&#xD;
brought-it to me. I used to grease him to prevent&#xD;
the friction of the air from pullin' his hair out.&#xD;
He used, frequently to git up and run in&#xD;
is sleep ; and I was often obleeged to tie him&#xD;
over night to keep him still; for I feared the&#xD;
Wretar would run himself into a gallopin' con-&#xD;
sumption. Every body that knew him said he&#xD;
run to extremes. When there was nothin' in&#xD;
pertickerler for him to do, I allers tied up one&#xD;
Leg ; but that did'nt make much difference&#xD;
rter all; he'd go out o' sight like a streak o'&#xD;
chalk.'&#xD;
'Did he die a nateral death in his kennel ?'&#xD;
inquired the trapper.&#xD;
'I ain't got to that yet, Brass Eyes,' return-&#xD;
ed Buston.&#xD;
&#xD;
him; for when he got tired o' runnin' on one&#xD;
side, he could turn over and run on the other.&#xD;
'What become of him at last 2&#xD;
' He got a runnin' one day and co l'nt stop,&#xD;
and I hav'nt set eyes on him since . I've no&#xD;
doubt but he's a runnin' yet.'&#xD;
'He was a wonderful critter.'&#xD;
'Yes, Bose was-as wonderful for a dog as&#xD;
Two Forty is for a hoss.'&#xD;
' You said his name was Towser.'&#xD;
'He had three names, said Buston, after a&#xD;
momentary pause; 'two for week days and one&#xD;
for Sundays.'&#xD;
The hunter smoked a few whiffs, and then&#xD;
went on.&#xD;
'I once killed seven Blackfeet, who attacked&#xD;
me at one time.'&#xD;
' How was it done?' I asked.&#xD;
' Why you must know I am mighty powerful&#xD;
&#xD;
'Don't call me that name no more,' said Gil- in the magnetic line; and when I see the var-&#xD;
nore, sharply.                             mints a coming' at me, I throwed down ,my weap.&#xD;
' One day a curious accident happened to ons and commenced making' passes at 'em like&#xD;

THE'. FOREST FIEND.                 49&#xD;
&#xD;
beautiful. A gentle west wind was breathing&#xD;
softly over the trees and flowers. The settlers'&#xD;
cabins looked pleasantly in the moonlight.,&#xD;
In thetear of the- clearing was a range of&#xD;
low hills, covered with cotton woods, beach&#xD;
and maple ; upon the left, at a short distance,&#xD;
flowed the Red Fork of the Arkansas river ;&#xD;
upon the right were the green meadows I have&#xD;
before referred to; in front of the cabins the&#xD;
small brook, also mentioned in another chapter&#xD;
went murmuring.&#xD;
I felt attracted towards the game meadow&#xD;
which had delighted me so much on a previous&#xD;
occasion.&#xD;
With sauntering, yet thoughtful steps, I ap-&#xD;
proached it. As I passed on, I could not help,&#xD;
looking at the range of hills where I had wit-&#xD;
nessed the' death of Prairie Wolf. The whole&#xD;
scene was recalled with .a distinctness I could&#xD;
not well account for. I saw him standing again&#xD;
by his horse ; saw him raise his hand, point to&#xD;
the south; heard him speak of the land of souls ;&#xD;
saw him fall down dead.&#xD;
j' Who is Black Ralph ?' I asked for the thou-&#xD;
sandth time.&#xD;
Who could answer me ? No one, and so the&#xD;
mystery must remain a mystery still.&#xD;
How rational it was that I should think of&#xD;
my escape also, and other events following it;&#xD;
the strange visitor ; the fatal meeting with Os-&#xD;
borne.-&#xD;
I felt sorry that I had slain him, notwith-&#xD;
standing that I knew he deserved his fate. No&#xD;
man, when he is calm and rational, wants the&#xD;
crime of murder on his hands. He may wish&#xD;
a person dead, but the consciousness of being&#xD;
his murderer would hang like an incubus upon&#xD;
his soul.&#xD;
I paused in my walk to view the scenery.-&#xD;
The meadow lay like a smooth, green carpet&#xD;
before me, and the light of the moon fell upon&#xD;
it like beams of silver. On every side the&#xD;
woods and hills shut it in, and it waa indeed an&#xD;
oasis in the wilderness. It was the same I had&#xD;
passed thro before I met Flora for the first&#xD;
tize; and iemed dearer for that remem-&#xD;
branco. Id slowly along its margin, stop-&#xD;
&#xD;
ping a moment to contemplate the skies, and the&#xD;
quiet scene at my feet.&#xD;
I had gone about half the circumference of&#xD;
the meadow. I was passing a avery dense growth&#xD;
of sycamores, when a man sprang from their&#xD;
concealment, presented a pistol to my head,&#xD;
and fired. The ball grazed my cheek, and the&#xD;
weapon was so near that the blaze burned m&#xD;
hair. In a moment my cocked rifle was at i&#xD;
breast..&#xD;
'Stir' not, on your peril!' I cried.&#xD;
The man recoiled a step ; the moonlight&#xD;
streamed down upon his face ; Osborne was&#xD;
before me.&#xD;
'I thought you were in h-ll' lI exclaim&#xD;
ed.&#xD;
'It is by no favor of yours that I am no&#xD;
there,' he answered, fiercely.&#xD;
'I thought I had left you a heap of dust an&#xD;
ashes; but I am glad that the breath of life r&#xD;
mnained in you ; that I have not cheated th&#xD;
hangman. No doubt but you have merite&#xD;
death many times; yet I thank God that I a&#xD;
not your murderer.'&#xD;
' Canting hypocrite ! devil's own ! it is eas&#xD;
to talk thus while you hold a loaded rifle to m&#xD;
breast!' exclaimed Osborne.  'Oh yes ! youe&#xD;
play the saint as well as the devil.  Fire, i&#xD;
you are going to, and don't let me hear your l&#xD;
ing words; they torture me.'&#xD;
'You sprang upon me like an assassin,' I re&#xD;
plied, 'and would have laid me bleeding at yea&#xD;
feet. There .is no good reason why I should&#xD;
show you mercy. How can you g agine for&#xD;
moment that I shall spare you. Come, man&#xD;
many crimes, prepare for death. , Look up&#xD;
the moon, and stars, and quiet skies, for the la&#xD;
time.  Say your adieus to all on earth-t&#xD;
wood; stream and prairie. Send up a prayer&#xD;
Heaven, and be quick ; for I would, have  over&#xD;
'That is mercy indeed ! give a man like -a&#xD;
two minutes in which to make his first and Inl&#xD;
prayer ! Fool! do you suppose an old sinne&#xD;
like me to make peace with offended Heaven i&#xD;
so short space ? A~ year would not sullice-'&#xD;
' Time is flying. Remember that in a few nn&#xD;
utes those very mooubeamns at your feet wi&#xD;
&#xD;
shine upon your dead face. Try to imagine&#xD;
yourself lying down here at my feet, with your&#xD;
dead, ashy face, turned towards Heaven-the&#xD;
place you have thought of least in life.&#xD;
'Taunt on, devil's bantling ! you have the&#xD;
advantage-; I cannot defend myself; but were&#xD;
we in a fair field, armed alike, and face to face,&#xD;
it would be different.'&#xD;
'If .I will yield up my present advantage,&#xD;
and spare your life, will you meet me in the&#xD;
field, armed as I am? Speak!'           -&#xD;
'Try me ; but that you fear to do.'&#xD;
'Swear that you will meet me in his meadow&#xD;
to-morrow morning at sunrise, armed with a&#xD;
rifle at fifty yards, and I will forego my present&#xD;
advantage.'&#xD;
Surprise for a moment kept Osborne dumb.&#xD;
'I swear it!' he said, in a lower tone, 'and&#xD;
bright and early will I be on the spot'&#xD;
'And you may bring one friend with you to&#xD;
see fair play,' I added.&#xD;
'I agree to it,' replied Osborne, with a grim&#xD;
smile. 'It suits me well.'&#xD;
' Go, then, unharmed, and reme      you&#xD;
fall to-morrow, that I shall not be your murder.&#xD;
er-only the means Heaven makes use of to&#xD;
mete out justice.'&#xD;
'Please yourself with such folly, if you will ;&#xD;
I care not, if you keep your appointment. I&#xD;
will not oblige you to wait for me a second.'&#xD;
I dropped the muzzle of my rifle.    Os-&#xD;
borne turned slowly away.&#xD;
'At sunrise,' I added.&#xD;
'Aye t at sunrise ; and don't forget that I&#xD;
have often killed my man,' and the tall figure&#xD;
Osborne was soon lost to view.&#xD;
As I retraced my steps, I could not help&#xD;
thinking -'that it might be I was taking my&#xD;
last walk by moonlight. .&#xD;
I found Flora standing near the door of the&#xD;
cabin.&#xD;
'You have been walking,; you are very im-&#xD;
prudent,' she remarked.,&#xD;
'It matters little what becomes of me,' I&#xD;
answered.  *I have no father or mother to&#xD;
weep for me.&#xD;
' But you have friends.'&#xD;
&#xD;
' Perhaps I have a few,' I returned, sadly :&#xD;
for at that moment I felt my loneliness and&#xD;
friendlessness most bitterly.&#xD;
'You are sad to-night,' she replied.&#xD;
'Yes,; Iam sad; I have been thinking of the&#xD;
past. It is a dark subject to dwell upon ; but&#xD;
such reflections are natural.. Imagine a help-&#xD;
less child, that never received a mother's kiss,&#xD;
or a father's blessing. Imagine him fighting&#xD;
his way up to manhood, with no one to love&#xD;
and care for him. - What can you hope from&#xD;
such a being-what redeeming influence can&#xD;
save him ?'&#xD;
' The God that rules the-universe, has said&#xD;
that He will be a father to the fatherless. Trust&#xD;
to His guidance, and all may be well. Per-&#xD;
haps you have a mother in Heaven who throws&#xD;
around you the soft influence of her presence.'&#xD;
'Not so, Miss Dale,' I answered, 'It is sel-&#xD;
dom. that my perverted nature confesses the&#xD;
presence of an angel mother. My heart-is too&#xD;
hard and unrelenting to be receptive of such&#xD;
influences.&#xD;
' I believe the human heart is always suscep-&#xD;
tible of spiritual impressions. Bad indeed must&#xD;
be he who is forsaken by an angel mother, or&#xD;
sister.'&#xD;
'It is a pleasant doctrine to believe in, Flora,&#xD;
and to one who is young and pure, it may not&#xD;
seem unreasonable. Were you to -assure me&#xD;
that you had felt the presence of your sainted&#xD;
mother, I wouldnot quarrel with your credulity.&#xD;
There are periods in my own existence when 1&#xD;
firmly believe in the immortality of the soul.'&#xD;
'You should, believe it ever. There is a&#xD;
voice within you that speaks continually of eter-&#xD;
nal life. Seek first the Kingdom of God, and&#xD;
you will cease to complain of the want of kin-&#xD;
dred ; you will be able to stretch forth your&#xD;
hands to the whole human family, and say,&#xD;
behold my father and my ,other, and my&#xD;
brethren.' Nought but the christian religion&#xD;
can satisfy the desires of the human eoul, and&#xD;
fraternize mankind.'&#xD;
I made no answer, for I wished to express no&#xD;
doubts to shake the trusting faith or distresathe&#xD;
heart of one so young and innoc5 ta&#xD;

We remained silent for a short space of time&#xD;
f'You spoke to me once,' said Flora, at&#xD;
length, ' of Osborne, in a manner so strange that&#xD;
it has been a source of pain to me since. I&#xD;
could have wished that some other hand had-&#xD;
had-'&#xD;
'Slain him,' I added.&#xD;
'Then you did slay him !' she exclaimed,&#xD;
clasping her hands as if terrified.&#xD;
'Do you regret his fate, Flora?'&#xD;
'It is not that ! Oh it is not that ; but the&#xD;
crime is yours.'&#xD;
And that pains you ?'&#xD;
It does-it does / I would that some other&#xD;
hand had wrought the deed !' and Flora cov-&#xD;
ered her face with her hands to hide her .tears.&#xD;
'Flora, dearest Flora ! the sin of murder is&#xD;
not mine. 'I have learned within the hour that&#xD;
he still lives.'&#xD;
Flora gasped for breath like a drowning per-&#xD;
son.,&#xD;
Have you met him ?' she asked, in tremb-&#xD;
ling accents.&#xD;
Nay, Flora, question me not.. Suffice it&#xD;
that he lives, and has the power to injure&#xD;
you'&#xD;
' But I am glad for your sake, that it is so.'&#xD;
' Think of yourself, Flora. Be careful not to&#xD;
venture from the cabin alone. If aught should&#xD;
happen-if I should leave you sooner than'you&#xD;
expect-.--I 'beg that you will think of me peca-&#xD;
sionally  one who was your friend, however&#xD;
unworthy of that honor I may have been. In a&#xD;
paiieular manner do I request that you will he-&#xD;
aN   f the machinations of Osborne. I *ill&#xD;
noftrust myself to give utteance to all that&#xD;
rises up in my heart; there is one secret I will&#xD;
keep, perhaps it will die with me. I cannot&#xD;
say; it is hard to tell what the future maybring&#xD;
forth. .   --&#xD;
Flora blushed.&#xD;
*Something tells me that you have met Os;&#xD;
borne; I.hope nothing unfortunate will come of&#xD;
it.'.;&#xD;
' You believe that God orders all things,&#xD;
Flora; perha Hie will .direct all for the best&#xD;
in this case.&#xD;
&#xD;
*Trust in Him, Seward ; your faith will not&#xD;
be lost. Yog/will think me a strange girl, but&#xD;
I feel sure that we all owe a duty to Heaven;&#xD;
and that the trusting heart will be strengthened&#xD;
and made better.'&#xD;
'Speak on, Flora, your words are kindly and&#xD;
true,; they fall upon my heart as rain upon the&#xD;
parched earth,'or as the dew upon the grass. I&#xD;
only wish that I coup- be ever near you-ever&#xD;
listen to your gentle tones-ever 'be blessed&#xD;
with such a monitress.'&#xD;
' You give me too much credit for goodness.&#xD;
You will shlme me into silence by your flattery.'&#xD;
I mesit 6t to flatter you ; God forgive me&#xD;
if I did-it was the thought farthest from nly&#xD;
heart. I would that I could speak to you,&#xD;
Flora ; but it is the vast difference in our moral&#xD;
condition, that makes me dumb.'&#xD;
'I dare not trust myself to say more now;&#xD;
but whatever may happen before another sunset,&#xD;
do not forget that Edward Seward was your&#xD;
friend-more than friend, if that be possible.'&#xD;
I sQ   d and pressed -my lips to her hand,&#xD;
Anda d 4 so, I was conscious that a tear fell&#xD;
upon it.&#xD;
'These are strange words,' she said, 'but I&#xD;
will notsforget.'&#xD;
I was ready to depart; but I still lingered, I&#xD;
knew not why.. I still held her hand; and it&#xD;
laid trembling in mine. I sank softly upon my&#xD;
knees beside her.&#xD;
'Dear Flora, I can keep the secret no longer:&#xD;
Do not frown-do not despise me-I love you 1'&#xD;
'Arise,' said Flora, in gentle accents; 'such&#xD;
* posture does not become you.'&#xD;
'Dearest, best of girls,  that my boldness&#xD;
has not offended you!'&#xD;
' Do I appear angry, Seward ?'&#xD;
I   ited to hear'uo more.  I caught Flora to&#xD;
my heart, and experienced the happiest moment&#xD;
of my life.&#xD;
I had found one heart to care for and love&#xD;
me, and was no longer alone in the world. The&#xD;
memory of that hour lingers yet. Sweet hour!&#xD;
blessed remembrance.&#xD;
The moon rode on in the skies and the stars&#xD;
looked down and smiled. Never was night so&#xD;

sweet and fair ; her lips never smiled so pleas-&#xD;
antly; her hair never curled so gracefully about&#xD;

With a kiss, and whispered words of fondness,&#xD;
I tore myself from Flora.&#xD;
'You're a brick-a perfect brick,' said a well&#xD;
known voice, as I walked away.&#xD;
'How long have you' been here ?' I 'asked,&#xD;

'You are both right.'&#xD;
What weapons?'&#xD;

Rifles, of course,' said Buston. 'Pistols&#xD;
aint fashionable heft. They might do among&#xD;
your fine gentlemen, but they're of no account&#xD;
with uJs.'&#xD;
' What's it all about asked the trapper,&#xD;
anxiously.&#xD;
I gave them an account of what had taken&#xD;
place between myself and Osborne. I had not&#xD;
mentioned his name to them before.'&#xD;
' Then you must fight the critter?' said Gil-&#xD;
more thoughtfully.&#xD;
'It cannot be avoided,' I answered.&#xD;
There's but one way to get you out of the&#xD;
scrape,' he added.&#xD;
' How is that1?'&#xD;
' Let me take your place.'&#xD;
Ah, my friend, that will not o'&#xD;
&#xD;
'You see you're a young man, Seward, and&#xD;
ifanything unfortunate should happen, somebody&#xD;
-I wont say who, might feel bad, and never&#xD;
know no happiness arterwards. Not so with me,&#xD;
by any means. The best days of my nateral&#xD;
life are over., If I should go under, there&#xD;
wouldn't be nobody to weep for me ; and you&#xD;
see it wouldn't make a great deal o' difference&#xD;
-in the long run. I'm  as willin' to die by a&#xD;
rifle ball as any way, pervidin' my hour has&#xD;
come.'&#xD;
'Brass Eyes!' exclaimed Boston, grasping&#xD;
the hand of the old trapper,' you're a brick I a&#xD;
brick, and nothin' shorter.'&#xD;
I took the other hand of the well me aning old&#xD;
man.&#xD;
'If to be a brick, as our eccentric friend has&#xD;
called you, means to be all that is kind and&#xD;
generous and noble, then do I agree with him&#xD;
perfectly. Not for a world would I expose you&#xD;
to danger. No, no ; your grey hairs are sacred ;&#xD;
they shall never come between me and Osborne&#xD;
to. save me, or to slay him, or both. I were in-&#xD;
deed unworthy the name of a man to permit it.'&#xD;
'Goodi youngster; you're a screamer!t I'll&#xD;
back you agin any critter as is at large at this&#xD;
present time.  ut let us come to some kind of&#xD;
an understandin'.  Gilmore wants to fight for&#xD;
you, and you wont listen to it on no account,&#xD;
whatsomever ; that's jest as it ought to be.&#xD;
Now I can prove to you in two ininits that I am&#xD;
the individooal as ought to have the priverlege&#xD;
of doin' the fightin'. Sich things come kin o'&#xD;
nateral to me, you know, and I like 'em."I;&#xD;
can't say that it aint morally out o' jint to stand'&#xD;
up and fire at your. feller cretur, and run the&#xD;
risk of losing' your own wind at the same time,&#xD;
I wont stop to decide that question. I want&#xD;
to fight this infernal Osborne, myself, Florry&#xD;
Dale is an oncommon cretur, and I 'slould'nt'&#xD;
want her to meet withno disappointment. Il&#xD;
take my rifle on my shoulder airly in the inornin',&#xD;
or jest at sunset, or jest as it happens to be&#xD;
and go whistlin' to the place o' meeting ,  I&#xD;
should'nt come back agin, let lorry keep Two&#xD;

thane the fire that dieth not. Better to sleep&#xD;
eternally, than to suffer eternal condemnation.&#xD;
The reader may perhaps deem me weak and&#xD;
cowardly, to indulge in such thoughts ; but&#xD;
weak and cowardly Iam not. rIt is natural for&#xD;
man to think of such subjects,"when death seems'&#xD;
near.&#xD;
To sa y that I feared'to meet Osborne, would&#xD;
do me great injustice ; for there is nothing&#xD;
craven in my nature. You may call this avow-&#xD;
al egotistical;' but I affirm  that it is not; my&#xD;
own heart acquits me of the charge. Hard&#xD;
would it fare with him to-day, who should call&#xD;
me a coward, although my nature has lost some-&#xD;
thing of its fire,, and the hot quick blood -of&#xD;
youth has cooled into the -sober currents of'&#xD;
manhood.&#xD;
Where is the person who can lay down to die&#xD;
in the possession of his senses, without asking if&#xD;
he has within him the germs of an immortal&#xD;
lifei;  This is not all. He will ask if there is a&#xD;
God to whom he is accountable for the deeds&#xD;
done in the body'?&#xD;
I o not speak .of a man as having -these&#xD;
peculiarities when he is convulsed with anger ;&#xD;
for then he gives such thoughts to the winds,'&#xD;
and rusheth to death as the horse to battle.&#xD;
I heard a gentle' tap upon, the door.   I&#xD;
stepped to it, ' Who in there '&#xD;
'Gilmore,' said a voice.-&#xD;
,Is it time'?' I asked, as I opened-the door.&#xD;
By no means ; I thought I'd come to see&#xD;
you once more, and perhaps you'd think better&#xD;
on t  The fact is Ive been talkin' with some&#xD;
' the settlers about this critter you call Os-&#xD;
borne. They say he's a dead shot, lie can I&#xD;
snuff a candle at two hundred yards, or split a&#xD;
ball on the edge of a knife, and think nothin'&#xD;
 it ,&#xD;
'It can't be helped,' said I.&#xD;
They say he's a quarrelsome, unprincipled&#xD;
critter, and his death would'nt be nio loss to&#xD;
nolmdy   liehas fouigat duels afore; and rifles&#xD;
are terrible things to stand u) afore, and be&#xD;

'Are-you a pretty good shot?'&#xD;
''Tolerable.  Yo have.b seen sdme of my&#xD;

best,' I replied.&#xD;
'Get a candle, if you can find  sclia luxury&#xD;
in these digging.'     -            -&#xD;
I stepped- into the cabin and ha  e good&#xD;
fortune to find one without awaking Arthur I&#xD;
then followed the trapper. We alked about&#xD;
three quarters of a mile from the -settlementee&#xD;
fore we stopped. Gilmore then lighted tie&#xD;
candle and fastened it upon a;map  limb. let&#xD;
then paced off two hundred yards..&#xD;
' Now, youngster, see if - you can snuff that&#xD;
candle ?'&#xD;
'That'srather too nice' shooting,' I replied.&#xD;
Nothin'like trying'  Straghten up and let,&#xD;
flyResol-ving to do  the  best I  could I  took  de-&#xD;
deliberate aim and fired.&#xD;
' You've:missed it!' said Gilmore.&#xD;
We hastened to examine the tree in front of&#xD;
which the candle was bu-ning.&#xD;
' It went about-two inighes wide of the mark.&#xD;
Not bad. Let sliver again.'&#xD;
I reloaded and fired again with better suc-&#xD;
cess--the ball passing within- an inch of the&#xD;
blaze.&#xD;
SI'm not used to shooting by moonlight' I&#xD;
do better by daylight.'&#xD;
' Never mind, you're gamin' upon it.'d-&#xD;
I've tried twice;, now its your turn&#xD;
'My nerves are not over aid above steady&#xD;
o-night, but I dont care it' I try my handa t it&#xD;
once: Come, Two Shooter, look at that blze.&#xD;
The old trap r brought the 'hreich o&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7609-00000026"/>&#xD;
BL CK '1ALPU&#xD;
&#xD;
rifle to his shoulder, with the muzzle de-&#xD;
essed. He raised it steadily;, the instant it&#xD;
upon the mark, he fired.   The candle&#xD;
flared, flickered a moment, and burned up again.&#xD;
'I'might have snuffed it a sixteenth of an inch&#xD;
closer,' said the trapper, cooly, as he proce ed-&#xD;
ed to charge his empty barrel.&#xD;
The candle which burned faintly at first,&#xD;
streamed up brightly. Gilmore stood perhaps&#xD;
four feet from me. While I was preparing to&#xD;
fire again, a ball went whistling between us, and&#xD;
the light of the candle disappeared. Every&#xD;
person who has heard a ball go hissing by them,&#xD;
know what a peculiar ringing it makes.&#xD;
I said that a rifle ball went whistling between&#xD;
the trapper and myself; suchI believed it to be&#xD;
at that moment, but what was very singular, I&#xD;
heard no sound to indicate that a gun had been&#xD;
discharged.&#xD;
Full of Surprise and curiosity, we hastened to&#xD;
examine our target.  About half its diameter&#xD;
below Gilmore's shot, was another, which in its&#xD;
assagehad severed the blazing wick close down.&#xD;
The trapper grew pale as he laid his finger&#xD;
upon the spot where -the ball had struck.-&#xD;
'If the devil ain't at large this year, it's my&#xD;
humble opinion he'll never visit the airth. You&#xD;
observe that two balls have gone into this tree;&#xD;
but they hav't made but one hole, though it&#xD;
has gone half its thickness below the other. The&#xD;
question is how did it get there'? Do you know?&#xD;
Do 1 know'?   Does anybody know ?    It was&#xD;
fired from a rifle I  But whose rifle was it'?&#xD;
Who fired it? I'm dumb-founded and used up'?&#xD;
Say sunthin'!i  Put your finger in my eye f&#xD;
Prick me with your hunting' knife, and see if I'm&#xD;
awake'&#xD;
It's certainly very mysterious,' I replied.&#xD;
It's Black Ralph, or the devil ' said Gil-&#xD;
more.&#xD;
Or both.'&#xD;
' When, rifle balls git to flyin' about without&#xD;
any powder, it's time to give up the business of&#xD;
huntin' and trappin'. It's hard to tell where&#xD;
ballswill hit when nthey git to 1e their own&#xD;
masters. I gaess we'd better be a travellin'&#xD;
towards the settlementt"&#xD;
&#xD;
'By no means. I am not at all disturbed or&#xD;
alarmed, although I frankly own that I am&#xD;
astonished beyond .measure. Light the candle,&#xD;
and I will try my luck for the third time.'&#xD;
The trial proved successful. The wick was&#xD;
severed, although, not in so perfect a manner as&#xD;
Gilmore had peformed the feat. t&#xD;
Capital!' he exclaimed.  'Do as well as&#xD;
that to-morrow mirain', and there'll be one&#xD;
scoundrel the less.'&#xD;
We shouldered our rifles and returned to the&#xD;
settlement. I was silent and thoughtful, and&#xD;
the friendly trapper was oppressed with gloomy&#xD;
forebodings.&#xD;
The hours of darkness rolled away. Before&#xD;
the sun had reddened the east, we were -.on the&#xD;
way to the meadow. Gilmore and I walked,&#xD;
along together, while Buston followed, leading&#xD;
Two Forty.,&#xD;
'I thought I would take the cretur along, as&#xD;
he might be wanted if you should take any blue&#xD;
pills for breakfast,' said! Buston.  ' I never got&#xD;
into but two or three sich scrapes myself. I&#xD;
kept perfectly cool, an4 let fly as soon as the&#xD;
word was given, for dinner was waitin'. I&#xD;
shan't forgit it very soon for I had a tearin' ap-,&#xD;
pertite.'&#xD;
'What became of your antagonist'?'&#xD;
'He died of a broken heart !'&#xD;
The sun was rising when we reached the ap-&#xD;
pointed spot ; and the dew was yet upon the&#xD;
grass.&#xD;
Osborne was no where in sight ; but in an&#xD;
instant he stepped from the thicket near "_s,&#xD;
He, wasnot alone.  A large, powerful tqauwas&#xD;
with him. I recognized in him the stranger who&#xD;
visited us at night. I ould not disguise, my&#xD;
surprise at seeing him.&#xD;
'It is the same as caught us napping,' said,&#xD;
the trapper. . ' I'm sorry to see the critter here.&#xD;
He wont do us no good.'&#xD;
The parties approached. I saw the stranger's'&#xD;
eye fastened upon me for a moment; after that&#xD;
he appeared to notice me no more.&#xD;
He and Gilmnore now stepped aside and con-.&#xD;
versed together~ confidentially; for a moment.&#xD;
During the time they were thus opgaged, Osborne&#xD;
&#xD;
E&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FUR&#xD;
lighted his pipe and be n to smoke. I turned&#xD;
my back upon him aff looked toward the spo&#xD;
where I had.leftflora. At that very momen&#xD;
she might be dream  'g of me. I looked toward&#xD;
the east. The sun was fairly above the lowes&#xD;
range of hills, and glowed fiery red. The dew&#xD;
upon the branches of the trees glistened lik&#xD;
' diamonds. The lark was up already, and the&#xD;
robin was singing his morning bsong&#xD;
Pleasing sounds from flowing waters and sigh&#xD;
ing Winds saluted my ear.&#xD;
How joyous and smiling were all things that&#xD;
fell beneath my vision.&#xD;
How delightful it would be to meet Flora there&#xD;
on such a morn. I might never meet her in&#xD;
this quiet meadow.&#xD;
'Have you said your prayers?' asked Osborne,&#xD;
ironically.&#xD;
'Save your .own soul!I' retorted Buston.&#xD;
The youngster ain't got no sins of any conse-&#xD;
quence to repent on. He worked out his salva-&#xD;
tion last night, while you was sleegin'.'&#xD;
There's enough of the devil in him to damn&#xD;
a dozen men,' replied Osborne, contemptuously.&#xD;
'There's enough o' the 4tif in him to shake&#xD;
you out of your moccasiasnor to strangle you&#xD;
like a dog,' returned Buston.&#xD;
'Or to sntff the candle of your life,' said.&#xD;
Gilmore, who now approached.&#xD;
' It'sarranged at fifty yards,' le added.&#xD;
That's a long distance,' answered Osborne.&#xD;
'You'll find it near enough,' replied the&#xD;
trapper significantly.&#xD;
The ground was measured off.&#xD;
The principals will take their places,' said'&#xD;
J]ustom.&#xD;
'I can't stand there,' said Osborne, ' the sun&#xD;
will shine directly into my face. I'm not going&#xD;
to be ahotin that way.'&#xD;
The ground was measured off in another di-&#xD;
rection.  We took our places. The rifles were&#xD;
loaded and placed in ouir hands.&#xD;
' Be perfectly cool,' said Gibniore, ashe gave&#xD;
me the deadly weapon. 'fDont be in too much&#xD;
of a hurry about firing . Be steady, and your&#xD;
shot will tell when you do fire.'&#xD;
&#xD;
EIST  FIEND.                             57&#xD;
d    If I should fall, tell Flora that I blessed her&#xD;
t with my dying breath.'&#xD;
t I glanced towards my antagonist.&#xD;
I He had thrown Away his pipe and stood there&#xD;
t straight as an arrow, and calm as a statue.&#xD;
' 'Are'you ready ?' iaid Buston.&#xD;
e ' All ready.'&#xD;
'I will count three, and when I say three,&#xD;
fire.'&#xD;
'One.'&#xD;
I thought of Flora.&#xD;
' Two.'&#xD;
I raised my rifle slowly.&#xD;
' Three.'&#xD;
Both of our rifles cracked at the same time.&#xD;
Osborne over-shot, and I heard the ball whistle&#xD;
over my head. I looked quickly towards him&#xD;
to see if he was hit. He stood for the space of&#xD;
half a minute without moving or speaking. He&#xD;
then staggered a step andfell.&#xD;
The danger was past.&#xD;
' He's got it said Buston.&#xD;
.Good !' exclaimed Gilmore.&#xD;
The stranger raised him up, and searched for&#xD;
the wound. It was in the left side, near the&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
'Leave us,' said the stranger. 'I will take&#xD;
care of him. He wont want care a great, while,&#xD;
probably.'&#xD;
II returned thoughtfully to the. .settlement;&#xD;
but my companions were in high glee.&#xD;
I met Flora, and her smiles dispelled a por-&#xD;
tion of the gloom the adventures of the morning&#xD;
had left upon my mind.&#xD;
'I have discovered your secret,' said Arthur,&#xD;
before the day had expired. ,' Gilmore hsabe-&#xD;
trayed you. Why did you not confide the whole&#xD;
to me ?'&#xD;
From motives of kindness,' I replied. 'If&#xD;
I had fallen, you would have reproached your-&#xD;
self, and made yourself unhappy, because you&#xD;
were concerned ii' it.'&#xD;
'But I would have insisted on taking. your&#xD;
place.'&#xD;
' It would hive been of no avail ; I should&#xD;
have remained firm.'&#xD;
Flora overheard this conversatie, andI was&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
AN ADVENTURE&#xD;
HOUGH the events of the morning still&#xD;
hung likea darkYcloud over my mind's&#xD;
horizon, the evening that followed passed&#xD;
away very pleasantly,&#xD;
Story telling was again resorted to. Dale re-&#xD;
lated the following.&#xD;
IrWas 3lte fist.man who felled a t-re-in this&#xD;

to venture so far into the backwoods, I know;-&#xD;
but 'Iam constitutionally bold. Nothing can&#xD;
'daubt tne.  As for bears,uIndians and panthers,&#xD;
I care but little about them. But I ought to&#xD;
think of Flora, Isuppose. The poor girl isn't&#xD;
used to siteh a=life:  I 'wish it was place of&#xD;
greater security on her account, heaven.:'knows.&#xD;
If I ever leave here, and it is iot at allunlikely,&#xD;
it will be together out' of 'har a's way. -.They&#xD;

venture with one of those animals I never shall&#xD;
forget. I had been hinting allday, and began&#xD;
to feel tred and somewhat discouraged withal,&#xD;
for I had not been very successful. -I stood on&#xD;
the margin' of a small lake, which lies about&#xD;
south-west from here.  It had lg" a finesday.&#xD;
The sun was just bidding the western wilderness&#xD;
good night.; While E leaned upon my rifle,&#xD;
musing, thebenms *f the sinking sun ceased'to&#xD;
gild the peaks of the far distant mounlains.-&#xD;
The night was fair, upon me. Old' Boner lay&#xD;
quietly at my feet&#xD;
I started from my reverie, for I was sonie&#xD;
miles from here.&#xD;
Conie, Boxer, 'it's time to be going towards,&#xD;
the settlement.'&#xD;
Boer sprang up and wagged his t, as&#xD;
much as to .say .&#xD;
'I'm ready if you are.'&#xD;
I shouldered my i fli, and' walked swiftly&#xD;
along the margin of ine- lake.  I hadgone&#xD;
about twentyyards we, a ,shriek $.loud and&#xD;
piercing that it made me shudder,,wasborney to&#xD;
my e~re., It fame;from the other side .,of the&#xD;
lake, and resembled athe shrill, ,artling cry. of&#xD;
a woman in distress; butmore pitepis angd op-&#xD;
rible far.  r&#xD;
Boxer uttered a lop , discontented whinse, and&#xD;
pressed as close to m4 as possible. This was&#xD;
uncommon conduct foru him'; for hewas iot&#xD;
easily frightened, Iampwilling to owl that I&#xD;
was niot perfectlyunnmoveil myself. '*Thatsbriek&#xD;

I knew very well Whatkind a thrtaftt ta i&#xD;
&#xD;
M. U&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FORIEIST FIEND.&#xD;
&#xD;
earthly sound came from. I had heard it be-&#xD;
fore, but not often,and never when alone ; and&#xD;
I hid heard old hunters afflirta that they could&#xD;
successfully imitate the screams of a woman.&#xD;
Not knowing What else to do, I quickened&#xD;
my pace, hoping, the distance :between me Lnd&#xD;
the animal being so great, that I could reach&#xD;
the settlement in safety. But I had gone only&#xD;
a few steps when I heard the panther set up a&#xD;
frightful yelling, exactly opposite, me, as be-&#xD;
fore.&#xD;
'I made a 'full stop,' as the school master&#xD;
used to say, to consideriwhat to do next.&#xD;
'We'll try it once more, Boxer,' I said to&#xD;
my canine companion, and then pushed forward&#xD;
gain. This'time perhaps I went twenty rods&#xD;
before I heard the savage beast cry out again;&#xD;
and he seemed to be a little ahead of me. '&#xD;
'This would'nt, of course, answer, because it&#xD;
could'nt be a great while before we should meet&#xD;
at that rate.&#xD;
'I turned again and walked faster than ever,&#xD;
but with no better success, and with hardly so&#xD;
good ; for the creature was obviously impatient,'&#xD;
and was resolved to make the circuit of the lake.&#xD;
I thought at first that I would now walk away&#xD;
from the lake as rapidly as possible:; but a mo-&#xD;
ment's reflection: ade me abandon :this idea ;&#xD;
for when the panther had once gotten upon the&#xD;
side of the lake where I then was, he could ea-&#xD;
sily overtake me ; hence my only chance of es-&#xD;
cape seemedto be in keeping'the water between&#xD;
us.&#xD;
There was no time to lose ; so I changed&#xD;
my " direction once more  The lake is about&#xD;
three miles long, and there was a pretty' good&#xD;
chance for a run; so;I started and ran about a&#xD;
mile or more in a way that showed thatI was in&#xD;
a hurry, I assure you. During this time I heard&#xD;
not a single sound;' and that silence was more&#xD;
ominous than: any thing else, because I could&#xD;
not tell where my enemy was, and I feared he&#xD;
might come upon 1ne of a sudden. But when&#xD;
U had gone the distance I have named- -'and I&#xD;
wasn't long about it-I' heard the blood-&#xD;
thirsty animal cry out again, and on this occa-&#xD;
iron it came from the extremte end of the pod;&#xD;
&#xD;
he had not changed his course when I did, and&#xD;
the truth that he was gaining on me could not&#xD;
be concealed or lost 'sight of.&#xD;
When the water was no 'longer betweeri us,&#xD;
how long would it take him to overtake me-t-&#xD;
Not long certainly. What was to be done noir?&#xD;
I knew not what to-do, and so I kept on as fast&#xD;
as my limbs would carry me.&#xD;
My particular sensations:it will not be neces-&#xD;
sary to attempt to describe ; if any ofyou have&#xD;
been in a similar situation, you know. something&#xD;
about it ; otherwise you do not. A rman may&#xD;
be brave, and" a good hunter, and all!that, yet&#xD;
not feel exactly comfortable with -a catanount&#xD;
after him. Such a-state of things gives one an&#xD;
unpleasant sensation of being torn in piecesand&#xD;
eaten alive. If 'you imagine for the shortest&#xD;
possible space of time that, I didn't run, you&#xD;
labor under a mistake ; for Two Forty could'Tht&#xD;
have done much better,&#xD;
On I went, and on came the-panther,of course.&#xD;
All at once he shrieked again; but that wasn't&#xD;
all ; his terrible cry was answered by another&#xD;
of his species in the opposite direction, which&#xD;
was directly before me. - So there was danger&#xD;
behind meand: danger before me. 'Well, what&#xD;
did I do then ?  I stood-still for the space:of&#xD;
four minutes. -During that time a dreadful hor-&#xD;
ror of being eaten by panthers seized'me: I&#xD;
fancied I heard the cracking of the dry sticks&#xD;
and leaves; their low angrygrowls; the gnabh-&#xD;
ing of their terrific teeth ; that I felt their hot&#xD;
breath' in my face ; that they were tearing my&#xD;
flesh; that' the bones were being crushed.&#xD;
I shuddered with unmitigated horror.; A&#xD;
happy thought darted through my,, brain. I&#xD;
would limb a tree! Yes, I could climb atreet 1&#xD;
and be comparatively safe.&#xD;
But there was Boxer, my old friend ant eon-&#xD;
panion ; what was to become of him?-  Shod&#xD;
I desert him who *had neveredeserted =me? 2Oie&#xD;
who would'flgbt:for'me"to the last gasp:of4ii?&#xD;
Would that not be a base and: cowardly 'ati6&#xD;
Poor Boxer!' It seenned to" me selfish 'and&#xD;
cruels to leaves him. H~is lighting blood now&#xD;
seemed to be getting aroused.&#xD;
He began to walk around runakieg'the&#xD;

&#xD;
hair stand straight upon his back, and emitting&#xD;
low, threatening growls.&#xD;
' Are they coming, old Boxer?' asred I.&#xD;
Boxer wagged his tail, and looked anxiously&#xD;
into my face as though he understood me; and&#xD;
I know he did.&#xD;
Are they near ?' I asked again.&#xD;
He put his large .nose upon the earth, and&#xD;
snufied as if to find out.&#xD;
A very tall sycamore stood close behind me,;&#xD;
but at a little distance, were others quite as&#xD;
elevated.&#xD;
'Take to the water, Boxer,' I said, pointing&#xD;
to the lake; 'into the drink  with you, old&#xD;
friend, and I'll look out for myself.'&#xD;
The creature seemed to comprehend me in a&#xD;
moment. He walked round and round the&#xD;
tree until I had got up some distance, and&#xD;
didn't appear to take it hard that I was leav-&#xD;
ing him.&#xD;
Hark I what was that?    Boxer heard it;&#xD;
it was the sound of an animal in rapid motion.&#xD;
I heard i.:distinctly ; and on it came, bound af-&#xD;
ter bound, clearing a goodly space at a leap.&#xD;
The dog continued to walk round the tree, occa-&#xD;
sionally looking up to see how it fared with me,&#xD;
and how fast I ascended. He wagged his tail&#xD;
asiifto encourage me to persevere ; and seemed&#xD;
anxious on my account more than on-his own.&#xD;
' Into the water, Boxer, good fellow !' Iecried,&#xD;
I'in safe enough now.'&#xD;
Boxer made the circumference of the tree&#xD;
once more, then sprang out into the lake, and&#xD;
swam several rods from the shore, taking a po-&#xD;
Asition,-where he could see me and watchmy&#xD;
movements ,keeping his shaggy head just above&#xD;
water, which he did with little or no effort.&#xD;
All was silent again ; I heard no bounding&#xD;
pounds ; nocracking of the sticks ; no rustling&#xD;
of the: leaves. There was something dreadful&#xD;
to me in that silence. I dont know why it was&#xD;
dreadful to me unless I was impressed by way&#xD;
ofpresentiment ; for I believe when danger. is&#xD;
really ;impending, the person in jeopardy -is&#xD;
often nmade sensible of it in a way lhe cannotl&#xD;
account for- Mank is, a curious creature, I as&#xD;
date gotrt; and I have found it so.- Just at thai&#xD;
&#xD;
moment the moon came up in full orbed splendor&#xD;
and looked mildly down unpn the lake and the&#xD;
great forest. I was glad to see it ; for I need-&#xD;
ed light on the subject, sorely.&#xD;
But where were my enemies ? I will tell you&#xD;
where one of them was ; he came down with a&#xD;
tremendous bound, within two rods of the syca-&#xD;
rmore among whose branches I was lodged. He&#xD;
snuffed the - air a moment, and then crouched&#xD;
down like a cat. Hewas a monstrods beast,&#xD;
and ugly enough be looked as he lay there&#xD;
lashing the ground with his long tail. Saint&#xD;
Peter, what an enormous paw he stretched out ;&#xD;
and what a tongue he displayed. And- that&#xD;
was not all; he exhibited two rows of terrible&#xD;
teeth. Did I have a peculiar tingling sensa-&#xD;
tion in my flesh about that time of night, or did&#xD;
I not, or what was it?&#xD;
I knew there was strength enough in one of&#xD;
those paws to rend a dozen men in an instant&#xD;
of time ; and how easily those large jaws could&#xD;
crush the bones.&#xD;
I will fix you, my lad,' said I to myself,&#xD;
for I felt quite secure up there. Before I had&#xD;
commenced climbing, I, had been :careful to&#xD;
lash my trusty rifle to  my back, as, you&#xD;
will readily suppose. After I had located my-&#xD;
self firmly between two large branches, I disen-&#xD;
gaged it, examined the pruning, and satisfied&#xD;
myself that it was in first rate order.&#xD;
About in the centre of the animal's breast,&#xD;
there wasa small round white spot. I rested&#xD;
my rifle upon a i6nb, and took beautiful aim at&#xD;
that spot; and a nice mark it was, but my nerves&#xD;
shook a little, despite all my self control. I&#xD;
did not pull the trigger_; something seemed to&#xD;
tell me not to, and to restrain:me.&#xD;
Boxer who had hitherto been perfectly quiet&#xD;
now howled furiously,,of a sudden. I looked&#xD;
at him and perceived that he was gazing intent-&#xD;
ly and; anxiously upward into another tree, a&#xD;
few yards from, that which I had climbed. I&#xD;
turned my eyes in that direction. also. Good&#xD;
Heavens,! what a sensation I experienced'!-.&#xD;
what a shiver of horror ran through my frame&#xD;

was the other panther ! a  more ugly looking&#xD;
monster, if possible, than the first. His fire&#xD;
eyes were fixed upon me with a peculiar long-'&#xD;
ing, savage expression; and his paws were&#xD;
placed in the attitude of springing. It was a&#xD;
critical moment. I felt for the first time the&#xD;
full sense of the imminent peril of my position.&#xD;
I had hitherto, lost sight of the fact that a&#xD;
panther is the most agile and cat-like of all ani-&#xD;
mals, capable of climbing a tree, and of leaping&#xD;
from one tree to another.&#xD;
But the horror of my position did not have the&#xD;
effect to unman me; it acted like a powerful&#xD;
tonic, although if you could have seen me at&#xD;
that instant, with the moonbeams shining down&#xD;
upon my face, a pale visage you would have&#xD;
beheld. Strange what a habit the blood has&#xD;
of receding from the face in a moment of dan-&#xD;
ger; where does it go, I wonder ?  But it's&#xD;
about the panther I'm talking.'&#xD;
'Go it, Bricks,' said-Buston, somewhat em-&#xD;
phatically.&#xD;
If you never saw a panther's tongue, you&#xD;
ought to, especially when he is excited ; it re-&#xD;
minds me of the deadly fangs of a serpent; such&#xD;
venomous creatures as I have read about,&#xD;
and sometimes seen. Seeing an Indian com-&#xD;
ing at you full of fight and fury, is nothing to&#xD;
that.'&#xD;
'Please dont keep this cretur springin' so&#xD;
long, old Gunpowder,' interrupted the hunter.&#xD;
' I will not dwell upon it longer, for I feel&#xD;
myself incapable of describing the scene, and&#xD;
my own sensations at the time. At'the crisis,&#xD;
when all appeared. lost, with a wonderful self-&#xD;
possession (which I cannot account for) I pulled&#xD;
trigger, upon the panther. ' Lhe very second&#xD;
that I fired, and I may say simultaneous with&#xD;
the act, he made a mighty bound, straight to-&#xD;
wards me. His long body struck upon the&#xD;
limb upon which I stood, broke it short offclose&#xD;
to my feet, and then went crashing downward&#xD;
to the earth.'&#xD;
'Did he stop when he got down?' asked&#xD;
Buston.'&#xD;
' When he reached the ground there was'nt&#xD;
life enough in him to shake his great body with&#xD;
a single convulsion.'&#xD;
&#xD;
'You might put it all in your eye, and not&#xD;
have it hurt you, I spose,' added the hunter-&#xD;
'What next? Explode, Gunpowder!'&#xD;
'I took a long breath!' resumed Dale.&#xD;
'From  your heels up'ards, probably,' con-&#xD;
tinued Buston.&#xD;
'I took a long breath, thanked God-..'&#xD;
'Stop,.old feller ! you'd ought a waited a bit&#xD;
'till you'd disposed o' the other varmint. My&#xD;
father used to tell me never to crow 'till I got&#xD;
out o' the woods. What difference would it a&#xD;
made to you which o' the varmints had you for&#xD;
his supper?'         I&#xD;
'Not much, certainly,' replied Dale, good&#xD;
humoredly, ' but I always think it best to be&#xD;
grateful when the Father of mercies seems to&#xD;
befriend us in a particular manner.'&#xD;
'If having' two catamnounts arter you is being'&#xD;
befriended, I should'nt care about bein' be-&#xD;
friended ; that's a mercy I-should'nt want to be&#xD;
the father on,' said Buston, seriously.&#xD;
'The other panthe-, when he saw the fate of&#xD;
his companion, uttered frightful yells, and tore&#xD;
up the ground with his long claws, and old Box-&#xD;
er made a triumphant splashing in the" water,&#xD;
and barked gloriously to celebrate my success.&#xD;
' All understood ; Boxer was takin' a bath&#xD;
while you was takin' an airin' above. Proba-&#xD;
bly he never had his feet soaked so we l 'nce&#xD;
he was a pup. Wasn't his general healt1tier&#xD;

'I should'nt wonder if my hand shook a little&#xD;
when I poured the powder into it for the next&#xD;
charge, put the ball--&#xD;
'Would'ntit do jest as well to load it up all at&#xD;
once, and not keep the other cretur waitin' at the&#xD;
root of the tree ?  If it will be any help to you,&#xD;
we'll imagine you've got the ball drove home,&#xD;
and are all primed and cooked; but I'd advise&#xD;
you to take a short aim.'&#xD;
'Yes, I was all-ready-to fireand-'&#xD;
' Let sliver!'&#xD;
' No, I did'nt1 you are wrong there. All&#xD;
at once the creature leaped all of fifteen feet&#xD;
into the air--a few migihty-spasms shook his&#xD;
frame, and to all appeg.eshe was dead.'&#xD;

but one, and on that side there should be a&#xD;
narrow and delightful entrance. The hills that&#xD;
embosom this spot should be covered with trees&#xD;
of noble growth. I will not name the different&#xD;
kinds, but they should all be green and comely.&#xD;
You perceive that the place would be a deep&#xD;
valley. A  small crystal stream  should pass&#xD;
through it, and find its way out somewhere, I&#xD;
don't know how; but its banks should be luxi&#xD;
uriantly verdant. All kinds'of flowers, -lerbs&#xD;

nice, speckled trouts, perch, and shiners. The&#xD;
valley should be beautifully clad in green, for&#xD;
I should want no winter there, and birds whose&#xD;
songs are sweetest should sing without getting&#xD;
weary.&#xD;
Not far from the stream there "should be a&#xD;
cottage, and  the graceful willow and the sweet&#xD;

riate in the genial soil around it. Creeping&#xD;
vines should run over the roof, and insinuate&#xD;
"themselves into every nook and granny, and&#xD;
hang upon every projecting corner. This same&#xD;
spot should be a garden of Eden.' I would be&#xD;

I dropped Flora's hand ania turned toward&#xD;

I will now pass over a period of time. The&#xD;
reader will imagine that we have left the settle-&#xD;
ment upon the Red Fork, and are en route for&#xD;
the Great Salt Lake. There were about 'tei-&#xD;
ty of us, children and females included?  The&#xD;
baggage wagons   are drawn by rules and&#xD;
horses, and make quite a picturesque appear.&#xD;
ance as they wind along on their devious way.&#xD;
Flora rides Two forty, and Buston is never a&#xD;
great way off, mounted upon the animal which&#xD;
formerly belonged to Prairie Wolf.&#xD;
I shall not enter into the detailsof travelling&#xD;
i  the West. They are well knowanto thoe&#xD;
who have read Irving's 'works, and followed&#xD;
Bonneville and Fremont in their wandeing. .&#xD;
Long is the way, slow'and toilsome" our rnove-&#xD;

But I am writing my adventures and tie ad-&#xD;
ventures of those most intimately, conugeted&#xD;
with me ;.therefore I shall not relate the his-&#xD;

South Park, the Old Park, and the kind reader&#xD;
will now find us comfortably encamped upon&#xD;
White river; at its junction with the Rio Colo-&#xD;
rado.&#xD;
If you look for me you will find me seated on&#xD;
the bank of the last mentioned river. At no&#xD;
great distance from  me you will perceive the&#xD;
smoke of our fires curling up through the trees ;&#xD;
you will observe also that the sun is just setting&#xD;
and his last beams are seen upon the tops of the&#xD;
mountains.&#xD;
I am thinking of Flora; how could I live&#xD;
without her, and how dear she grows to me&#xD;
every day.    .    .    .    .    .   And&#xD;
it happened as I sat musing, that I heard foot.&#xD;
steps. I looked up to see who came, and the&#xD;
strange visitor at night.-Osborne's second-&#xD;
stood before me.&#xD;
I gazed at him with profound astonishment.&#xD;
Again we meet,' he said, slowly.&#xD;
'So it seems.'&#xD;
'What do you here ?'&#xD;
'Whatever pleases me. What do you do?'&#xD;
'What you would not dare do.'&#xD;
,That cannot be true.'&#xD;
Why not ?'&#xD;
'Because I fear not to do what other men&#xD;
dare.'&#xD;
'You have an excellent opinion of yourself,&#xD;
'young man.'&#xD;
'That concerns nobody but myself. What is&#xD;
your business with me?'&#xD;
I have come to warn you of approaching&#xD;
danger.'&#xD;
'Judging from the position you occupied&#xD;
when I last met you, I should suppose you&#xD;
would not be the man to warn me of danger.'&#xD;
Judge not from appearances, in all cases,&#xD;
young man.'&#xD;
Is Osborne dead ?'&#xD;
'Osborne is living.'&#xD;
Is it possible?'&#xD;
I have said it.'&#xD;
~ hat is your namie V&#xD;
'You are inquisitive, young man.'&#xD;
f What is your name?'&#xD;
'Yen may call me Forrester, for want of a-&#xD;

RALPH&#xD;
&#xD;
' I think you said you had come to warn me&#xD;
of approaching- danger. I am ready to hear&#xD;
you. '&#xD;
'You dont seem to be in the best of humor.'&#xD;
'As good as usual. I doubt your good&#xD;
faith.'&#xD;
'That is natural. Ingratitude is the most&#xD;
common of sins.'&#xD;
* Why do you speak of ingratitude?. What&#xD;
do I: owe you in the way of gratitude ?'&#xD;
'More thanyou are aware of, perhaps. You&#xD;
should be-grateful that I have sought you to&#xD;
tell you to be on your guard-that danger is&#xD;
lurking near you.'&#xD;
'Convince me that such is your object, and I&#xD;
will not cease to be grateful; but as I have said,&#xD;
I doubt you.'&#xD;
'Well, doubt on; I like your frankness.'&#xD;
'I wish I could say that I like you, or any.&#xD;
thing about you.'&#xD;
'No matter whether you like or not. I can&#xD;
live without you better than you, aan without&#xD;
me.&#xD;
'I have got along thus far very well without&#xD;
any of your help, and I dare say I shall con-&#xD;
tinue to.'&#xD;
'Very good ; be as independent as you like.;.&#xD;
it is all the same te me. What I wish to say to&#xD;
you is this : Before the sun is twenty four hours&#xD;
older, you will be in great danger ; perhaps&#xD;
death will be- the result; perhaps not; it de-&#xD;
pends much on yourself. If you heedwhat I&#xD;
say to you, it is very probable that you will&#xD;
escape; if you disregard mycoansel, there}are&#xD;
two chances of degteto ene of escape.'&#xD;
'Is that all?'   {&#xD;
'No ; Flora is also in peril.'&#xD;
Flora?'&#xD;
Yes, .blora!  That name seems to dispel&#xD;
apathy.'&#xD;
'Forrester-if that indeed be your name-I&#xD;
beg of you to syeak to me more plainly, if you&#xD;
really mean whatyou say, and have the remo-&#xD;
test wish to befriend me.'&#xD;
I uttered these words with great earnestness,&#xD;
and looked searchingly at the tall, powerful man&#xD;

said he, with a smile. 'There i magic in' he&#xD;
name of Flora.'&#xD;
'For me there is, stranger, I confess.'&#xD;
'Well, I think no worse of you' for that.&#xD;
There is magic in her eyes, also, as well as- in&#xD;
her name, and 'a dangerous kind of magic&#xD;
it is.'&#xD;
'You wander from the subject, I replied,&#xD;
pleased in spite of myself, at the tribute he&#xD;
had paid to Flora's beauty.&#xD;
'The nature of the impending peril, I may&#xD;
not divulge. It is sufficient for you to know,&#xD;
that it is near, and imminent; and that by ob-&#xD;
serving due caution you can meet it, and over-&#xD;
come it.'&#xD;
'Let your speech be less ambiguous. Speak&#xD;
frankly, if you would be believed. Mystery I&#xD;
like not, and I have always remarked that&#xD;
where there is much mystery there is much de-&#xD;
ceit.  A stranger comes to me and says, 'There&#xD;
is danger near you,' but refuses to make&#xD;
known the nature of that danger; now how&#xD;
much importance ought to be. attached to his&#xD;
words ?'&#xD;
'Your reasoning is false--your inferences'&#xD;
are wrong. If you love your own life-if you&#xD;
love Flora Dale, during the next twenty-four&#xD;
hours, be continually on your guard. Let the&#xD;
whole party keep together. Do not leave them&#xD;
for a moment, nor suffer Flora to.'&#xD;
'Tell me one thing. How do you know&#xD;
Flora Dale ? Where have you met her ?'.&#xD;
'You have asked two questions instead of one,&#xD;
young man ; suffice it that I have seen her,&#xD;
and know her ; that is enough for your pur-&#xD;
pose and mine. Will you do as I have direct-&#xD;
ed?'&#xD;
M' I dont know ; I will see.'-&#xD;
'You are self willed and obstinate. I have&#xD;
a mind to leave you to your fate,-let you die&#xD;
as the fool dieth.'&#xD;
' I came into the world like a fool, and to be&#xD;
consistent, should go out like one. What do&#xD;
you say to that ?'&#xD;
The stranger changed color and bit his lip.&#xD;
'aWas your father like you-?' he asked ai-d&#xD;
ruptly.&#xD;
&#xD;
EST  FIEND.      -6&#xD;
I dont know. My father and I were stran-&#xD;
gers. I never had the honor of his aequain-&#xD;
tance. What more would you say?'&#xD;
He died when you were an infant, proba-&#xD;
bly.&#xD;
'You say so.'&#xD;
'No; I asked a question.'&#xD;
'You'll have to answer it.'&#xD;
'Then you. dont know your own father?'&#xD;
'Cease to question me. My father was a&#xD;
villain whoever he was,' I replied, with much&#xD;
bitterness. 'You were speaking of some great&#xD;
danger. Have you more to add ?'&#xD;
'No ; you scorn my friendly counsels.'&#xD;
' Give me some proof that you speak truly,&#xD;
and I will follow your directions implicitly, and&#xD;
will henceforth class you among my friends.'&#xD;
'Listen, you number twenty in all ; before to-&#xD;
morrow night there will be but nineteen of you.'&#xD;
. Where will the other one be V'&#xD;
'No matter; I have said. Twenty now,&#xD;
nineteen to morrow. Think of 'it young man.'&#xD;
And the man who called, himself Forrester,&#xD;
turned abruptly from me, and walked away.&#xD;
Once he paused as if he would turn back, then&#xD;
he quickened his pace and was soon lost to my&#xD;
view.&#xD;
I sAt still and mused on. I was not in the&#xD;
best of humor,;I acknowledge. Who was For-&#xD;
rester ?  What did he want?  Had he spoken&#xD;
in good faith?  Dont know I Can't tell. I&#xD;
shall see. But I have but little faith in this&#xD;
stranger, though I have often thought of him&#xD;
since the night of our first meeting.&#xD;
I recalled his words, and repeated them in my&#xD;
mind ; yet they gave me but little uneasiness.&#xD;
I walked leisurely towards tie encampment.&#xD;
War-Path, the Utah Indian, iet me. This&#xD;
friendly savage had not left- us since we first&#xD;
fell in with him, near the settlement ; and he&#xD;
had acted in the capacity of guide during our&#xD;
journey.&#xD;
He had learned a few words of English, and&#xD;
seemed much pleased withi his new friends,&#xD;
the pale faces. I had also applied myself to the&#xD;
~Pah-Outah language, andeconquered a portion of&#xD;
ijts hard words ; so we could now get along to-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7609-00000031"/>&#xD;
60                               BLACK&#xD;
gether very well, in the way of conversation.&#xD;
War-Path was, accompanied on this occasion by&#xD;
an Indian who had joined us a few days before,&#xD;
and of whom  I knew but little. They were&#xD;
talking earnestly together.&#xD;
'How is my white brother?' said War-Path.&#xD;
'Very well. How   is my red brother; and&#xD;
what is he talking 'about so earnestly ?'&#xD;
' 'am well, and I was talking of the bad&#xD;
Manito of the woods.'&#xD;
'And what of the bad Manito of the woods,,&#xD;
red brother'?'&#xD;
*All my brethren fear him. I was thinking&#xD;
what a great honor it would be to kill him.&#xD;
*iYou cannot kill him, brother. He rides&#xD;
upon the winds. He comes and goes, and deals&#xD;
out death to the red lnah, and you cannot see&#xD;
him   How then can you slay him?'&#xD;
War-Path looked at me seriously, then at his&#xD;
companion.&#xD;
He thinks he can kill him, white brother,'&#xD;
he replied, pointing his fInger at his red friend.&#xD;
Letlhim try,' I answered. ' It will be the&#xD;
hardest day's work he ever attempted.'&#xD;
War-Path smiled, shook his head doubtfully,&#xD;
and passed on.&#xD;
'How are you, stranger?' said a voice.&#xD;
I paused. wondering v hat new adventure was&#xD;
before me. The figure of a man leaning upon&#xD;
a long rifle, was the first object that met my&#xD;
sight. At-first I thought it was Osborne, for-&#xD;
the. figure was about his height.&#xD;
Did you speak ?'     .&#xD;
I reckon as how I did.' was the rejoinder.&#xD;
I'am happy to see you.'&#xD;
Them's my feeling's ' was the reply. 'And&#xD;
here's my hand for you to shake; and though its&#xD;
rough and hard, its an honest one.'&#xD;
The franknes of the stranger pleased me, and&#xD;
I shook the proflered hand with right good will.&#xD;
This is a strange wild country,' he added.&#xD;
Do you like it?'&#xD;
Do I like it, stranger I as I loved my moth-&#xD;
er's milk, when a babe. It's a glorious coun-&#xD;
try, and I could live in no other. Have&#xD;
you seen any of the'/seathen creturs in your&#xD;
wanderin's ?'&#xD;
&#xD;
RALPlh&#xD;
&#xD;
'I have met them, often. I dare say you&#xD;
have had nAny adventures with them'&#xD;
'My name is Baptiste La oy; and when&#xD;
I've said'that you'd ought to have inown sunthin'&#xD;
about it '&#xD;
-' It gives me pleasure to shy that I have;&#xD;
often heard of you. Gilmore has mentioned;&#xD;
the name of La Roy, more than once.'&#xD;
'Is Gilmore near these diggins, stranger?'&#xD;
' He is where you see the smoke curling up&#xD;
through the trees yonder.',&#xD;
'It can't be possible ! I've known him ever,&#xD;
since he's been" in the wilderness. I've often,&#xD;
been in at the leath with him ; though he has&#xD;
no partickelar system o' finishin'. I go in for&#xD;
the eye.'&#xD;
'So Gilmore has told me.'&#xD;
'There paint nothin' like death in the eye ;&#xD;
though there is some very clever chaps who go,&#xD;
in for the bridge o' the nose system, and don't.&#xD;
like no other style o' finishin'.&#xD;
' Do you invariably shoot them in the eye?'&#xD;
' Allers, when I can see the heathen creturs'&#xD;
eyes ; if I can see 'em, why then, I do the&#xD;
best I can, though it goes rayther agin the&#xD;
grain to finish 'em in any other style.'&#xD;
' There is one thing I wish to ask you,' I&#xD;
said, with considerable earnestnes. 'Have'&#xD;
you ever heard of a being galled Black Ralph,-&#xD;
during your lotg pilgrimage in the woods ?'&#xD;
La:Roy approached me and laid his hand&#xD;
on my arm.&#xD;
' Have I heard of Black Ralph I Can any&#xD;
human cretur wander up and down this great&#xD;
wilderness for years, and not hear of that onao-&#xD;
countable cretur ?'f&#xD;
'What do you think of him?'&#xD;
'That's a hard question, stranger ; I'd' rather&#xD;
you'd ask me sunthin' else;,&#xD;
Would you like to, bring old Ironsidea to&#xD;
bear upon him once ?'&#xD;
Hush I stranger, I- wouldn't no more level&#xD;
this shootin' stick at Black Ralph, than I'd&#xD;
put my hand into the fire that's blazin' out&#xD;
yonder where your friends are. And why should&#xD;
I wish to harm him ? Has he done me any&#xD;

Sleeping an    isg; waking and sleeping;&#xD;
dreaming of' F   and' Osborne, Forrester and&#xD;
Black Ralph; so the night wore away.&#xD;
CHAIPER XiI.&#xD;
)(was up int    morning before my com-&#xD;
panions. The first rays of the rising sun&#xD;
blushed faintly in the east. The birds&#xD;
were singing merrily. Thinking I was the only&#xD;
person stirring about the encampment, I stepped&#xD;
forth to inhale the refreshing air of morning.&#xD;
I was much surprised at beholding Flora at a&#xD;
short distance from the encampment. I hasten-&#xD;
ed to join her, and the next moment stood by&#xD;
her side.&#xD;
'You are abroad early, Flora,' I remarked.&#xD;
'Yes, I thought it too fine a morning to be&#xD;
lost in sleep.'&#xD;
But you, are. imprudent. It is not safe to&#xD;
move so far from the encampment. Let me&#xD;
hope you will be cautious in future.'&#xD;
'Are you given to presentiments ?!&#xD;
'Not often, but there are moments when I:&#xD;
seem to feel the approach of danger. No long-&#xD;
er ago than last night I experienced one of&#xD;
those mysterious influences that.warn us of the&#xD;
approach of an evil hour.'&#xD;
' To be frank with you, Seward, I experi-&#xD;
enced the same undefinable feeling of impending&#xD;
evil. I wonder what it can be?'&#xD;
'I wish I could tell you,' I replied; but&#xD;
that I cannot do. Lema walk upon this bank.&#xD;
What a romantic spot 1'&#xD;
'You are violating your own maxims,' said&#xD;
Flora, with a smile. 'We are going from the&#xD;
encampment.'&#xD;
'We will be careful not to wander far. With&#xD;
thee, Flora, it- seems to me that the whole&#xD;
journey of -life would be but a pleasant stroll&#xD;
through delightful groves, and a land of per-&#xD;
petual flowers. Row much real happiness can,&#xD;
&#xD;
67&#xD;
&#xD;
I perceive in the storehouse of the future.. I&#xD;
shall call you mine, and you will be near me&#xD;
ever.. There is only one thought that chills&#xD;
my happiness-the life on earth is too brief a&#xD;
period for the enjoyment of love like mine.&#xD;
Would that time -could. be lengthened into eter-&#xD;
nity. But death steps in like a.grim. and fell&#xD;
destroyer ; and so my Flora, and I, must pass&#xD;
away.'&#xD;
'You are wrong, Seward. There are low,&#xD;
sweet voices that whisper unceasingly into my&#xD;
ear of a life to come.. Call not'death a destroy.&#xD;
er ; he comes like a friend to emancipate the&#xD;
soul from its earthly slavery. . Our loves hg11'&#xD;
not pass away with the fleeting breath; they&#xD;
shall be renewed in a world of eternal blessed.&#xD;
ness. The voices that I tear hourly and daily,&#xD;
tell me this. Did' you ,never hear the voices,&#xD;
Seward ?  They are best heard in the calm&#xD;
hour of early morning, in the quiet noon of&#xD;
night, in the still, whispering twilight. It is&#xD;
glorious to listen to them, for they seem to 'be'&#xD;
the voices of my guardian angels. Speak not&#xD;
thou of the shortness of time. If we have 'loved&#xD;
truly here, we shall love truly where the sun&#xD;
never sets, and where the trees and flowers,&#xD;
bloom eternally.'&#xD;
'The voices have told you so?' I said, with.&#xD;
a smile, pressing the fair little hand of Flora, in&#xD;
my own.&#xD;
'A thousand times, Seward.'&#xD;
'You cannot talk of the' voices. too much,.&#xD;
Flora. I like to hear you. I have heard few&#xD;
preachers that I liked better.'&#xD;
'Look I' said Flora, suddenly changing the&#xD;
subject, 'yonder is the Indian that j  ed us a&#xD;
few days since. He seems thoughtful'  M.&#xD;
I followed the direction.of Flora's eyes, and&#xD;
beheld the Indian, to whom I have before allud-&#xD;
ed, standing on the bank of the river.&#xD;
We both paused and contemplated him some-&#xD;
time in silence.&#xD;
'A curious.race of beings are these same&#xD;
savages,' I observed, thoughtfully.&#xD;
'Have you conquered your dislike to them&#xD;
yet?&#xD;
Not in the least. I do not. I&#xD;

'They are not to blame for having a red skin,&#xD;
Seward.'&#xD;
'I dont know about that,' I replied. ' Just&#xD;
look at that creature ! What can you see about&#xD;
him that looks human?'&#xD;
'He does not look like us, it is true, yet there&#xD;
is something human about him, notwithstand-&#xD;
ing. But he is not like War-Path.'&#xD;
'Very true he is not so noble.'&#xD;
'Then you will allow that there is somthing&#xD;
noble about War-Path.'&#xD;
'But very little, however.'&#xD;
'I see you are resolved not to give the poor&#xD;
red man any credit for his goodness.'&#xD;
'Never mind; let us rest ourselves upon&#xD;
the bank. Here is a moss covered stone, that&#xD;
invites us to sit.'&#xD;
We both sat down ,upon the moss covered&#xD;
stone, and in a short time the thought of In-&#xD;
dians, and danger, were effectually dispelled from&#xD;
our minds, or at least from, mine.&#xD;
Perhaps we had remained there half an hour,&#xD;
perhaps twice that time, for we gave little heed&#xD;
to the footsteps of the old man with the grey&#xD;
locke and the scythe.&#xD;
Flora's smiles were pleasant to look upon ;&#xD;
her voice was sweet to listen to ; the river made&#xD;
a dreamy sound, the birds thrilled it merrily ;&#xD;
so time went on. How   long we should have&#xD;
sat there and talked, and smiled upon each&#xD;
other, I know not; a scream, shrill and start-&#xD;
; flg, from Flora, caused me to spring sudden-&#xD;
1 to my feet, and as I did so, I perceived the&#xD;
Indian of whom I have just spoken, in the act&#xD;
of falling, and he was not three feet from us.&#xD;
e had approached us it would seem unheard.&#xD;
In his right hand he grasped his hunting knife,&#xD;
and the fingers retained it after he had fall-&#xD;
emto the earth.  Before I noticed him farther,&#xD;
I was obliged to turn my attention to Flora, for&#xD;
she was fainting with terror.&#xD;
I strove to reassure her, but it was some mo-&#xD;
ments ere she grew calm enough to explain what&#xD;
she had seen.&#xD;
It appears, as she sat upon the bank, and&#xD;
gazed down into the water, she had seen the&#xD;
shadow efthe Indian reflected there with great&#xD;

with the deadly weapon, whioi*disifeless hand&#xD;
still grasped, when she utt   e' cry which.&#xD;
caused me to spring to my fe&#xD;
'Fear nothing, Flora,' I S  as calmly as&#xD;
I could.  'The savage is p   doing you an&#xD;
injury. Justice is even now meted out to him.&#xD;
Black Ralph is abroad.&#xD;
Flora turned and looked at the body.   I1:&#xD;
pointed to a small wound in his left breast.&#xD;
'Behold where the life oozed out,' I said.&#xD;
'I perceive only a large drop of blood there,'&#xD;
replied Flora.&#xD;
Yet death found an entrance there. That&#xD;
dark drop of blood flows from a wound that no&#xD;
leech on earth can heal.'&#xD;
leecannot realize that he is dead,' returned&#xD;
Flom. ' It is but a moment since I saw that&#xD;
strong, tawny arm upraised to strike. What&#xD;
a strange thing is death! how suddenly it&#xD;
comes.'&#xD;
'Strange enough is death; but a death like&#xD;
this is passing strange.'&#xD;
' There is much that is wonderful about this&#xD;
whole transaction, Seward. Why did he wish&#xD;
to aim a blow at my life ? What cause had he'&#xD;
for such an act ?  I know him not ; and to my&#xD;
knowledge have rendered him no evil.'&#xD;
.' What have I always told you, Flora? have&#xD;
I not assured you many times that red men are&#xD;
a treacherous and faithless set! I have always&#xD;
hated them-I hate them   still-and with a&#xD;
hatred more bitter and unrelenting will I regard&#xD;
them in the future. Look at him  as he lies&#xD;
there. A moment or two since he was a living&#xD;
creature, with a heart full of hate, cunning,&#xD;
and malignity.  He would have slain you with-&#xD;
out cause. But God in, his justice sent an un-&#xD;
known and unheard messenger to lay him low,&#xD;
and I thank Him for it. He is merciful; hence-&#xD;
forth the name of Black Ralph shall be dear to&#xD;
me. Twill picture lhim a good angel, ever hov-&#xD;
ering near those in danger, to shield them from&#xD;
harm. No longer will f clothe his name with&#xD;
teri-or and dread ; but to me it shall be a pleas-&#xD;
ant sound ; for he has saved an existence dear er&#xD;
far than my own.&#xD;
&#xD;
. Flora looked trustingly into my face, and&#xD;
tears of gratitude bedewed her cheeks.&#xD;
'This seemed incredible,' she murmured at&#xD;
length.  'It surpasses belief. What hand sped l&#xD;
the' soul of this poor savage to its long home. s&#xD;
Touch him.-raise him  up-dash water upon s&#xD;
his face-see if he be really dead ?'&#xD;
' Nothing can shake him back to life ; all theI&#xD;
water in the sea would not revive him. That&#xD;
dust will never live again.'&#xD;
' And this you' say is the work of Black t&#xD;
Ralph ?'&#xD;
'Yes, Flora.'&#xD;
'And who is he ?'&#xD;
'That I cannot tell you. He is one that&#xD;
comes and goes with the silence of a shadow.-&#xD;
He dispenses death, and the stillness of the for-x&#xD;
est is not broken.  He speeds a soul-if an In-&#xD;
dian' has one-and mystery still covers him&#xD;
like a mantle. This is all I know of the 'Forest&#xD;
Fiend.'I&#xD;
He seems a fiend indeed,' added Flora.&#xD;
Not a fiend, Flora.'&#xD;
And why not?',&#xD;
Because he saved your life.'&#xD;
Very true, and yet I know not how it was&#xD;
done; I wlll try to. be grateful to him neverthe-&#xD;
less.'&#xD;
To-day you number twenty ; to-morrow you&#xD;
will number .but nineteen,' I said musingly, as I&#xD;
gazed at the stiffening body ; and I repeated it&#xD;
again and again, until Flora asked what - it&#xD;
meant.&#xD;
' I was thinking of something that has passed,'&#xD;
I answered, quickly, not wishing to excite her&#xD;
fears by a recital of yesterday's adventures.&#xD;
The stranger had spoken sooth; the sign had&#xD;
been given.&#xD;
' Go it, Cattridge Box !' said one whom the&#xD;
reader will know by this time.&#xD;
'Go it yourself, and see how you like it,' I&#xD;
answered,&#xD;
'Allers at it,' added Buston.  'Allers court-&#xD;
in', the oncommon eretur. If you was both&#xD;
travelling from sunrise to sunset, I a'pose you'd&#xD;
allers' find sunthin' to talk about. But what in&#xD;
the name o' natur is this ? Git up, you red&#xD;
Inj in Wha n irthi are ye layin' here&#xD;

'I don't much think that he will rise at your&#xD;
bidding,' I said.&#xD;
'Sure enough, youngster. He's got it in the&#xD;
eft breast. Its my opinion the devil lives&#xD;
omewhere hereabouts. It's dangerous to be&#xD;
afe anywhere in these parts.'&#xD;
At that moment Gilmore, Dale, Arthur' and&#xD;
La Roy made t eir'appearance.&#xD;
'Brass Ey s what do you think of this ?'&#xD;
In the heart,' said Gilmore, looking atten-&#xD;
ively at the body, 'right in the heart. The    )'&#xD;
ilent and onheard cretur is doing' his work.'&#xD;
'That heathen eretur has been called to stick&#xD;
his toes up in a sudden and onexpected manner,&#xD;
prepared or onprepared,' said La Roy.  'He&#xD;
has lost his hold on all things of a sublunar&#xD;
natur. I hope his mind had been properliyex-&#xD;
ercised in regard to the futur state.'&#xD;
'He never had no mind to brag on,' added&#xD;
Buston. 'He's got sunthin' now tiat he can't&#xD;
get up nor down-sunthin' as he's sure on.'&#xD;
'Poor fellow!' said Arthur, I "wish him a&#xD;
happy journey to the land of souls.'&#xD;
I don't wish the Ingin indervidooal no worse&#xD;
nor that,' added Gilmore.&#xD;
tI wish all the creturs were there, and&#xD;
there's any hurt in it, I'm w Min' to be for-&#xD;
given,' rejoined Buston. 'Thein's the natur of&#xD;
my sentiments, Brass-Eyes.'&#xD;
' I can't account for this,' said Arthur to me,&#xD;
in a low voice, after I had stated what had taIen&#xD;
place. ' There is something strange and awful&#xD;
about it. Just think of arresting the course of&#xD;
life so suddenly as a death like this indicates.--&#xD;
Alive and well one moment, a lump of clay the&#xD;
next.'&#xD;
As we all moved from-the spot I again said&#xD;
to myself, 'Twenty to-day, nineteen to-morrow.'&#xD;
The stranger had not spoken falsely. As he&#xD;
had predicted, so had it happened.&#xD;
As we walked towards the fires of our en-&#xD;
campment, I glanced backward to the scene of&#xD;
the strange tragedy ; War-Path was omitting&#xD;
the body to the waters of'the Rio Colorado,&#xD;
During that day's journey not on9 pf cus, I&#xD;
believe, could help thinking of the p4aordi&#xD;

:   Dont go ar,'aid La Roy, 'I've seen.signs Black Ralph himself cannot save you. You&#xD;

This way,' added Arthur' The noon will  -'Poor Flora !' I said, mentally.  'Poor Flo-&#xD;
be up soon, and it will shine pleasantly upon ra !' and then my eyes felt as though they were&#xD;
yonder hill-side.'                        hot and burning.&#xD;
We strolled on and conversed upon the many  Occasionally the moonbeams revealed the&#xD;
strange things we had seen and known in the features of the Indian, and I beheld the lines of&#xD;
wilderness. After we had gone some distance hate and malignity pictured thereon. I was&#xD;
we sat down and talked a long time upon various used to seeing ugly faces, but his made me shud-&#xD;
interesting subjects.                     der, uptwithstanding.&#xD;
We were upon the point of rising and leav- We rode on without abating our speed, and&#xD;
ing the spot, when I was conscious of receiving my sufferings' were most intense.  A dozen&#xD;
a stunning blow upon my head.             fevers seemed to be running riot in my veins&#xD;
I knew no more at that time. Dark, dreamy, No water was offered to cool my tongue. When&#xD;
confused images went swimming and whirling the morning dawned, I was a long, weary way&#xD;
before i eyes. I must have remained uncon- from my friends.&#xD;
sious for a long time.                      ' You are most to your journey's end,' said&#xD;
When, with a painful effort, I opened my Osborne. ' There remains but one more jour.&#xD;

&#xD;
THE FOREST&#xD;
streamed his light down among the mountains&#xD;
gloriously. I was taken from the horse and&#xD;
placed upon my feet,, but my limbs refused to&#xD;
bear me up. I sank upon the grass, and cared&#xD;
but little what my fate might be, providing it&#xD;
were soon over, and I were released from pain.&#xD;
The Indian;took his hatchet and trimmed the&#xD;
lowest branches from a small cotton-wood.-- &#xD;
When this was done, he produced several strong&#xD;
thongs of deer-skin. I was then stripped of my&#xD;
clothing' I submitted to all with the dogged&#xD;
apathy of despair.&#xD;
Had I been in the full possession of my&#xD;
strength, and not been rendered deathly sick by&#xD;
that racking pain in my head, I would have&#xD;
resisted and foughtto the last.&#xD;
I was now dragged to the cotton-wood, and&#xD;
placed against it. My hands were carried back-&#xD;
wards and lashed so firmly that there was danger&#xD;
of the hard thongs cutting through the flesh.-&#xD;
My other limbs were next tied to the cotton-&#xD;
wood with equal rigor.&#xD;
While this was being done, Osborne looked&#xD;
on with a smile of satisfaction.&#xD;
'If any person, by the merest chance should&#xD;
find their way to this spot, at the expiration of&#xD;
a few days, they will discover a skeleton lashed&#xD;
to a cotton-wood !' said Osborne ; and mounting&#xD;
his horse, he rode away, followed by the Indian,&#xD;
leading tho animal I had ridden.&#xD;
They were soon out of sight, and I was alone&#xD;
-left to starve-to faint--to perish in the sin.&#xD;
I was cut off from my friends ; human aid&#xD;
could not reach me.&#xD;
Indulgent reader, attempt, for a moment, to&#xD;
imagine yourself in my position. Endeavor to&#xD;
fancy yourself in the heart of an immense wil-&#xD;
derness, doomed to the most cruel of all deaths.&#xD;
Strive to picture yourself exposed to the hot&#xD;
rays of the'sun, and sighing for a drop of wa-1&#xD;
ter, even as the rich man sighed when he beheld1&#xD;
Lazarus afar off in Abraham's bosom. Imagine&#xD;
also that you feel a deadly sickness at the&#xD;
stomach, and that your brain is dreadfully rack-&#xD;
ed and dizzy-.&#xD;

The hours went rolling heavily onward. My&#xD;
limbs began to, swell and pain me horribly.-.--&#xD;
The sun shone fiercely upon me and burned&#xD;
my skin. I made frantic exertions to free my-&#xD;
self, but I could not move an inch, so well iail&#xD;
the work of my enemy been done.&#xD;
I cast my:aching eyes towards heaven ; but&#xD;
the sun flashed into them as if to burn them&#xD;
dry. I looked down to the earth,; and thep&#xD;
the thought occurred to me that I should never&#xD;
have decent burial, but be eaten by birds and&#xD;
wolves before my poor body was cold perhaps.&#xD;
What would Flora say when sle learned that&#xD;
I had suddenly disappeared and could not be&#xD;
found. Perhaps she might, in an evil moment&#xD;
think I had ba ely deserted her. But.no;&#xD;
that could not he; she knew me too well to do&#xD;
me so much injustice.. She would doubtless&#xD;
conclude the worst had happened, and would&#xD;
mourn my untimely fate many a long year.&#xD;
How my temples throb I My brain seems&#xD;
actually on fire ! What a blessed boon one&#xD;
single drop of water would be. 12bshall taste&#xD;

immergencies of my day. I am weak; thoR&#xD;

thine.  I shall go mad. This fierce sun, is&#xD;
scorching my brain. My sufferings overpower-&#xD;
ed me at length,. and insensibility put a tempo-&#xD;
rary end to my sufferings.&#xD;
I knew there was an interval in which a&#xD;
thousand incoherent thoughts and strange im&#xD;
ges went whirling before me. I have a faint&#xD;
remembrance that as I began to revive, I-f&#xD;
the horrible sickness and faintness again..z&#xD;
I knew I heard a friendly' and well known&#xD;
voice exclaim:&#xD;
'Go it, Cattridge-Box ! Qome. on, Brass-&#xD;

parfectly safe ; won't it make the heart of&#xD;

How my heart leaped ithin me, when tel&#xD;
tones of that voice fell upon my ear. How&#xD;
fervently I blessed the well meaning old hun-&#xD;
ter. Tears came to my aid-the first I had shed&#xD;
-and they moistened my burning eye-balls.&#xD;

'Bring water, stir your stumps !  Be lively,&#xD;
tie poor boy is in an unhappy state.. His&#xD;
tongue is as dry as a stick.  The Lord be mer-&#xD;
ciful to us all! -What a trick to serve a human&#xD;
eretur,' added Buston, while he severed the&#xD;
thongs that were imbedded in my flesh, with rap-&#xD;
'1a and dexterous strokes of his hunting knife.&#xD;
The critters shall smell gunpowder for this,'&#xD;
maid Gilmore.  'Open your mouth, my boy ;-&#xD;
here's water, fresh, clear sparkling water. Hurry&#xD;
up Brass-eyes ! turn the precious fluid down&#xD;
Iiis throat ; 'twill do him good. Now give him&#xD;
sunthin' out o' the bottle---a good dose of it.&#xD;
There, he opens his eyes.'&#xD;
'How hot the boy's flesh is,' replied Gilmore.&#xD;
£ It makes me feel oncomfortable to look at him.&#xD;
It puts me all aback. You'll have to hold old&#xD;
Two Shooter, to keep it still, arter this. Yes,&#xD;
this hollow bit -of steel will have work to do,&#xD;
and -the criters will take blue pills. Can't&#xD;
some pious indervidooal give me a chance at the&#xD;
varmints, about this hour of the day.&#xD;
'Becalm, Brass-Eyes ! govern your religious&#xD;
feelin's.  The time 'll come when we'll stand&#xD;
up shoulder to shoulder, and send particular&#xD;
conviction among the Ingin indervidooals. The&#xD;
spirit o' prophercy has fell on me like a stick o'&#xD;
timber.  We shall see what we shall see.'&#xD;
Gilmore carried me in his arms to a shady spot.&#xD;
He put my clothes on me with the gentleness of&#xD;
one who cares for-an infant. He bathed my head,&#xD;
face and hands in cool water, from which I&#xD;
experienced the most grateful sensations.&#xD;
Buston placed the bottle again to my lips,&#xD;
and I managed to swallow a considerable quan-&#xD;
tity of whiskey.&#xD;
While Gilmore was thus engaged with these&#xD;
kind offices, I relapsed into a deep and refresh-&#xD;
ing sleep. I faintly remember that something like&#xD;
a dream occurred to me.   The form of my saint-&#xD;
ed mother stood beside me.  Sweet sometimes,&#xD;
are the vagaries of sleep.&#xD;

K RALPH'&#xD;
CHAPTER         X III.&#xD;
BUTTON'S STORY .&#xD;
OPENED my eyes. A change had taken&#xD;
place in the appearance of things around&#xD;
me. A tent had been raised over me,&#xD;
softly, while I slept, and I found Gilmore's&#xD;
blanket wrapt about me. No person was in&#xD;
sight. The, pain in my head had subsided, and&#xD;
I no longer felt the deadly sickness at the stom-&#xD;
ach. It was near the hour of sunset, or sun-&#xD;
rise, I knew not which.&#xD;
As I lay there, the entrance to the lodge was&#xD;
darkened by the figure of a man. Forrester&#xD;
was again before me. He hesitated a moment,&#xD;
cast a furtive glance behind him, and then en-&#xD;
tered.&#xD;
'I find you sick and weak,' he said. ' When&#xD;
last I met you, you were well, strong, and bold.&#xD;
What are you now?'&#xD;
'I am helpless to-day; but I may be bold&#xD;
and strong again to-morrow, I answered. 'What&#xD;
more have you.to say?'&#xD;
'You have doubtless forgotten what I said to,&#xD;
you three days ago?'&#xD;
'Forgotten your words!' I wish I could for-&#xD;
get them.&#xD;
'I warned you of danger; you scorned my&#xD;
counsel. Look at yourself in a vessel of water,&#xD;
and mark the result.'&#xD;
'Yes; you did speak of danger near, and&#xD;
imminent ; but could you not have done more ?'&#xD;
'You speak like all the rest of mankind-not&#xD;
grateful for a little-ever reaching for pore-&#xD;
ever finding fault. Had you followed my coun-&#xD;
sel, you would not have been stretched upon&#xD;
this couch of pain.'&#xD;
'But you were so ambiguous in your lan-&#xD;
guage !'&#xD;
,If I told you one truth, and you believed&#xD;
it not, why should I have told you another. . If&#xD;
you would not heed my advice in one thing, why&#xD;
should I suppose that you would in another ?'&#xD;
Very true ; but I like not mystery, as I told&#xD;
you then.&#xD;
There is one question I would ask.'&#xD;

' If you knew what would happen, why did&#xD;
you not save me'?'&#xD;
'Let the future answer that.'&#xD;
'I do not comprehend you. Who are you?&#xD;
Why do you seek me?   Why do you wander&#xD;
up and down these woods?  What am I to you,&#xD;
or what are you to me?'&#xD;
'Do not trouble your head about those mat.&#xD;
terms. Try to get well. Seek out your enemy&#xD;
and slay him; hate Indians, be bold, and strong&#xD;
of heart.'&#xD;
' That's singular advice to give a sick man.'&#xD;
'It's the best I have ; receive it, or not, just&#xD;
as you please. I am not particular about such&#xD;
matters. I take care of number one ; you must&#xD;
do the same. I would give you advice to direct&#xD;
your course in future ; but you would heed it&#xD;
not, and, I forbear.'&#xD;
'Speak the truth, and I care not,' I an-&#xD;
swered.&#xD;
'I seldom speak falsely,' he said, proudly,&#xD;
' There is something more I would ask?'&#xD;
'Well?''&#xD;
'Are you my friend ?'&#xD;
For a moment Forrester was silent, and gave&#xD;
me a searching and earnest look.&#xD;
' Before God,' he replied, seriously, ' I&#xD;
know not whether I have been your friend or&#xD;
your greatest enemy!'&#xD;
'That would seem singular,' I returned, in-&#xD;
terested in the stranger, in spite of myself.&#xD;
Shall I see you again ?',&#xD;
If you live long enough, you will be likely&#xD;
to.'&#xD;
&#xD;
Indeed -'&#xD;
'Adieu for the present.'&#xD;
'You have no more to say, then?'&#xD;
It would be useless to say more. You are&#xD;
headstrong. We may meet again soon. Be&#xD;
careful of yourself:' and Forrester turned and&#xD;
left me as abruptly as he came.,&#xD;
He had been gone but a few minutes when&#xD;
Buston entered the lodge.&#xD;
'Where is Arthur ?' I asked.&#xD;
'I hope he's in some-safe place,' he replied,&#xD;
hesitatingly.&#xD;
'Have you seen or heard from him?'&#xD;
&#xD;
'I can't say I have.'&#xD;
'You know nothing of his fate, then ?'&#xD;
'I'm sorry to say I'm parfectly ignorant on&#xD;
that subject. It wont be well for you to think&#xD;
much about him at present. Try to get up&#xD;
agin as soon as you can ; that'll be better nor&#xD;
anythin' you can do. You've had along sleep.'&#xD;
'How long have I slept ?'&#xD;
' You went to sleep at. dark ; it's . mornin'&#xD;
now.'&#xD;
' I feel much better. Where are the rest ,f&#xD;
our friends?'&#xD;
'They are on the way here. You will be&#xD;
likely to see oncommon Florry afore the sun&#xD;
goes down.'&#xD;
How did you find me?'&#xD;
' We stumbled upon a tall, mighty queer&#xD;
chap, who put'us on the trail.'&#xD;
'Is it possible ?'&#xD;
' It isn't more nor less than possible.'&#xD;
'How did the stranger appear?&#xD;
'Jest as though he was in a great hurry, and&#xD;
had. got to go in another direction, post haste.'&#xD;
'Did he say much ?'&#xD;
' He pinted out the direction, and told us.not&#xD;
to let the grass grow under our feet.' Just as&#xD;
he - was turning away he said: 'if you don't&#xD;
find him there, I shall find himin another place,&#xD;
and you can tell the young gal so. With that&#xD;
he left us. We didn't have time to ask who&#xD;
he was, or ,where he came from. We followed&#xD;
his directions, and found our way into this curi-&#xD;
ous place, where we discovered you tied safely&#xD;
to a cotton-wood.'&#xD;
'Where is Two Forty?'&#xD;
'That oncommon horse ain't a great way off,&#xD;
you may depend on't.&#xD;
At that moment Gilmore appeared. I felt&#xD;
truly glad to see his friendly face. He came&#xD;
and sat down beside me, felt my pulse, exam-&#xD;
ined my tongue, &amp;amp;c., in a manner that evinced&#xD;
considerable knowledge of the healing arts&#xD;
'You are a: great deal better,' said he.&#xD;
'You'll be able to give the{ varmints their due&#xD;
yet, my boy.'&#xD;
' It is not the Indians I am indebtedtfor&#xD;

start of astonishment.  'I thought you'd fixedI&#xD;

It was him, then, that left you to roast and&#xD;
starve in the sun?'&#xD;
It was; thanks to your timely aid.'&#xD;
'The man you call Osborne won't never die a*&#xD;

He'll step out of the world in some awful and&#xD;
unexpected wanner.- It airi't often I prophecy,&#xD;
but when I do, you may set it down as sunthin'&#xD;

'When I say that Osborne will die with hisI&#xD;

added the trapper.&#xD;
'Speak your mind, Brass-Eyes.   Don't re-&#xD;
strain your nateral piety.'&#xD;
'I've often told you that my name wasn't&#xD;
Brass-Eyes, or any sich nonsense, and I'd thank&#xD;
you to bear it in mind,' returned Gilmore, in an&#xD;
offended tone. 'I've stood it as long as I could,&#xD;

'I hope it isn't a great way from here, old&#xD;

'I'mrthe man as is readyto go to it at any&#xD;

I now thought it time to interfere.'&#xD;

enough to do before you reach Utah Lake.'&#xD;

Buston said that' ' oncommon Florry was a&#xD;

But the fate of Arthur still remained a mys-&#xD;

Dale. 'I will never return untilI obtain some&#xD;
knowledge of him.'&#xD;

I asked.&#xD;
'I have reason to suppose so. I found a&#xD;

'I think he must be living,' I answered.&#xD;

Dale departed, accompanied by two of the&#xD;
emigrants. Gilmore and Buston remained be-&#xD;
hind to protect those not able to go on the trail,&#xD;
and who naturally look to man for protection.&#xD;
Under the gentle care of Flora, in a few&#xD;
days I was able to be about again, though my&#xD;
strength was not fully restored.&#xD;
Had our minds been at ease in regard to Ar-&#xD;
thur, time would have glided on very pleasant.&#xD;
ly. Many hours did I sit by the side of Flora,&#xD;
and listen to the wild tales of Gilmore and Bus-&#xD;
ton. Sometimes we heard  thesestartling reci-&#xD;
tals in the open air, beneath the bright siun, or&#xD;
the silvery moon, and .at others in the quiet&#xD;
lodge, during the mild hours of evening, while&#xD;
the howl of the wolf and the hooting of the owl&#xD;
was heard in the distance.    -&#xD;
Once, when'I had recovered sufficiently, we&#xD;
sat near the door of our rural habitation, and&#xD;
Buston related the following, which I feel would&#xD;
be defrauding the reader to withhold from these&#xD;

inhabited by some kind o' human nature ; but it&#xD;
didn't seem' to me possible that any kind of a&#xD;
varmint whatsomever, could 'manage to live up&#xD;
there. I made up my mind as I lay there, that&#xD;
there wasn't a single indervidooal livin' upon&#xD;
any of the heavenly bodies. The stars and the&#xD;
moon was made to illumernate the airth during'&#xD;
the light, and. for nothin' else.&#xD;
Bat that's neither here nor there.  My views&#xD;
of astronomy mayn't be altogether interestin'.&#xD;
While I was. studying' about the moon and&#xD;
stars, and all sich nonsense, I heerd a poise not&#xD;
a great way from me. I thought at once it&#xD;
must be.one; o' the varmints, and so I opened&#xD;
my eye tight.'&#xD;
'What does that mean ?' asked Gilmore.&#xD;
'Keep cool, Brass=Eyes, and I'll tell you all&#xD;
about what happened. As I was obsarvin', I&#xD;
opened my right eye tight, and kept up a terri-&#xD;
ble lookin'. towards my traps.  The sounds&#xD;
tlat I heerd at first kept comm' nearer and&#xD;
nearer, and seemed to me like somethin' walk-&#xD;
in' cautiously. Well, on it come, and pretty&#xD;
soon 'I had the uncommon satisfaction of seem'&#xD;
a Blackfoot=standin' right over one o' my best&#xD;
traps.&#xD;

groan.  I dent think the red' feller ever real.&#xD;
ized what'sentIhim off to the 'happy hunting'&#xD;
grounds: It was good enough for him, for its&#xD;
awful wicked to steal iraps'!  I waited a few&#xD;
minutes to see if any more of the . creturs were&#xD;
near, and then dragged the body and threw&#xD;
it into the river.  When I had done this I&#xD;
set n  'traps, and took my place agin in th&#xD;
thicket. t was all of an hour afore I wa&#xD;
disturbed aging. At' the expiration of that time&#xD;
J heerdl other sounds; anda another heathen in&#xD;
&#xD;
dervidooal made his appearance. I was nearer&#xD;
to this one than I had been to 'the other.'&#xD;
He sprung the trap just as 'his predecessor&#xD;
did.  I let him turn fairly round with his back,&#xD;
to me, then I couldn't restrain my religious&#xD;
feelin's no longer.&#xD;
I jumped to my feet like lightning , and lit&#xD;
right down behind him, chucked the rifle agin&#xD;
the back of his head and let drive.  The cretur&#xD;
tipped over like a brick, and didn't give me so&#xD;
much as a crooked word, or look.  His face&#xD;
wasn't in a state for hislfriends to recognize him&#xD;
you'd better believe.  I throwed him into the&#xD;
drink, just as I had done the other.'&#xD;
And you killed the whole tribe in that way,&#xD;
I s'pose,' said Gilmore.&#xD;
'No, I didn't, Two Shooter; you shall hear.&#xD;
When I had dragged the Ingin's body into the&#xD;
drink, sunthin' seemed to tell me to go towards&#xD;
my hut and see what was goin' on in that di-&#xD;
rection. 1 obeyed the in'ard promptin's and&#xD;
crept softly back.&#xD;
When I got-very near the door, I began to&#xD;
think that I wouldn't go in, so I sat down in&#xD;
the thicket a little way off. You perceive that&#xD;
I had fired twice, and I was afeared the noise&#xD;
might attract the attention of other Ingins 'who&#xD;
might be in that vicinity.&#xD;
I sat there with my rifle across my knees,&#xD;
thinkin' about-it a long time-perhaps an hour.&#xD;
I didn't feel in the best of temper, because I&#xD;
couldn't keep the traps out o' mind. Just then&#xD;
I heard a slight rustling among the leaves. I&#xD;
looked steadily towards the spot where it come&#xD;
from and presently I saw a human cretur. He&#xD;
walked directly towards my hut.  As - soon as&#xD;
he reached the door I knew him. It was a&#xD;
voyageur whom I had seen in various places,&#xD;
under various circumstances.  He was half&#xD;
French and half Ingin, and' a rascally feller he&#xD;
was. He was allers found hanging' about some&#xD;
o' the Ingin tribes, puttin' them up to all man-.&#xD;
ner of mischief. If he knew where 'there was&#xD;
white trappers or hunters in the vicinity; he&#xD;
swas sure to go and see 'em, and pertend to be&#xD;

At that very instant there was a sharp report.&#xD;
The Indian scout swayed to and fro a moment,&#xD;
grasped spasmodically at the surrounding bushes,&#xD;
and then went whirling down the awful height.&#xD;
'Good heavens !   He's gone 1'&#xD;
' Go it, Cattridge-Box !' exclaimed Buston,&#xD;
with a yell of delight.&#xD;
'Hurrah fer Gilmore !' shouted the sturdy&#xD;
settlers, who had been observing the progress&#xD;
of the scout for the last five minutes. 'Gilmore&#xD;

Hark I All along the ragged sides of the&#xD;
mountain ranges, from gorge and rock, and beet-&#xD;

to their long pent up curses.&#xD;
The helpless children and females within our&#xD;

grew deadly pale, some fainted, and others&#xD;

The comical old hunter was in the act of&#xD;
bringing his rifle to his shoulder, when the well&#xD;
known crack of Two Shooter came once more&#xD;
to our ears.&#xD;
'The devil sieze Brass-Eyes!' exclaimed the&#xD;
disappointed hunter ;' he's cheated me out 'o&#xD;

The figure of Gilmore was now seen ap-&#xD;
proaching us. He appeared calm and collected&#xD;
as usual, but more serious.&#xD;
'It was handsomely done,' said I, as he&#xD;
joined us.&#xD;
'Two Shooter never wastes good powder and&#xD;
ball,' replied the trapper.&#xD;
'What's the prospect?'&#xD;
Bad.'&#xD;
'Do you apprehend much mischief from&#xD;

'If a single one of us lives to tell how I shot&#xD;

We all set ourselves to work right earnest-&#xD;
ly to erect a kind of fort with ramparts where&#xD;
the women and children could find a place of&#xD;
comparative safety while we were able to fight&#xD;
for them.&#xD;
The enemy did not suffer us to proceed&#xD;
peaceably with the work, but annoyed us with&#xD;
an incessant firing.  As they had but a few&#xD;
rifles among them, most'of their shots fell short&#xD;
but those who ventured within reach of our ri-&#xD;
fles were sure to be the sufferers. Several of&#xD;
their balls fell near us, and once, one struck a&#xD;

'Now's your time,' said Gilmore.&#xD;
I levelled my rifle towards the rock.&#xD;
'Be patient; his head will come up soon,'&#xD;
added the trapper.&#xD;
'I was patient, and the head came up as pre-&#xD;
dicted. I fired, and the head disappeared.&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
SKIRMISHING.&#xD;
EFORE night we were in a tolerable&#xD;
state of defence. The structure whicl&#xD;
was to supply the place of a fort, wa&#xD;
completed, and the men were employed in build&#xD;
ding a kind of breast-work around it. This&#xD;
was also built of the trunks of trees, arrange&#xD;
with strength and order.&#xD;
If driven from this wooden rampart, we couli&#xD;
.etreat to our fort, and keep the enemy at ba&#xD;
there.'&#xD;
'What do you think of this work?' Gilmor&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
I think it will do us good service. It i&#xD;
well and strongly built. I see nothing to hit&#xD;
der us from fighting a good battle.'&#xD;
'So we shall, my boy. We've been in on&#xD;
tight place afore ; but it was'nt much tight&#xD;
nor"this, arter all. We stood beside each ot&#xD;
er then, and we'll do it agin. Only a sing&#xD;
thread separated us from the gateway of etern&#xD;
ty then. I've thought about it a great ian&#xD;
times since, and wondered to myself that&#xD;
youngster like you, could be so cool in the fa&#xD;
and eyes of desth, Perhaps you 'wouldn't&#xD;

The kind old man paused and wiped his eyes&#xD;
with the sleeve of his hunting shirt.&#xD;
'Poor gal!' he added, ' perhaps she'll be&#xD;
spared.  God knows how to take care of his&#xD;
own.'&#xD;
'Let us hope so,' I replied. ' Let us hope-&#xD;
and pray that it may be thus.  As, you haveF&#xD;
observed, you and I have been in a straighter&#xD;
place than this and escaped.'k&#xD;
'I've got to mark here the critter made with&#xD;
the burnin' brand ; and I shall be the last hu.&#xD;
man bein' to forget it,' answered my friend.&#xD;
'When do you think they will attack us ?'&#xD;
'I should'nt wonder if they did to-night. In&#xD;
fact they'll be skirmishin' all night-perhaps-all&#xD;
the time.'&#xD;
'There's one thing that we must think of.'&#xD;
'What's that, boy '?'&#xD;
'What we shall eat and drink, provided we&#xD;
should be beseigedI for any length of time.'&#xD;
'An old backwoodsman like me wouldn't be&#xD;
likely to, forget that. There has'nt been a&#xD;
minit in the day but I've bad my mind on't. If&#xD;
s the critters can't fight us out, they'll starve us&#xD;
.out ; that's what they mean to do.'&#xD;
'"How long do you suppose what provisions&#xD;
d we have will last us with economy?'&#xD;
'Not much more nor three days at the long-&#xD;
d est.'&#xD;
y    'Let me ask you one thing more : Do you&#xD;
think it possible for any of us to pass through&#xD;
e the narrow defile by which we entered this place&#xD;
at the deepest and darkest hour of the night,&#xD;
s and return again ?'-&#xD;
n-   ' I won't say that it can't be done, but I'll&#xD;

ning as serpents, and that's what we must do to&#xD;
git along with these Ingin indervidooals.'&#xD;
Our whole party now took possession of the&#xD;
new structure, and forlorn as our condition was,&#xD;
we felt a sensation of relief when we found our-&#xD;
selves surrounded by those strong, though rude&#xD;
walls ; but it was not on our account that we&#xD;
felt relieved- -there were helpless ones with us&#xD;
for whom we cared.'&#xD;
'How much like the Runnin' Ivy she looks,'&#xD;
whispered Buston to me, looking significantly at&#xD;
Flora, while she busied herself in performing&#xD;
woman's offices in the new dwelling.&#xD;
'Poor girl !' said'I, thinking of the danger&#xD;
that surrounded her.&#xD;
'Have a stout heart,' said the trapper, 'I&#xD;
dare say there won't be no more nor half on us&#xD;
killed, and a few burned at the stake'; and it's&#xD;
kind o' consolin' like to' think on at this pertic-&#xD;
erler period o' time.'&#xD;
Consoling ?'&#xD;
'In course it is.  I say that perhaps there.&#xD;
won't be no more nor half or two thirds on us&#xD;
rubbed out, and leave the probationer state.-&#xD;
Now we can't tell who'll go, or who'll stay,&#xD;
because it would make us uneasy if we did.-&#xD;
We can set our minds to rest, and say inardly,&#xD;
it may be him, or it may be her, or this one, or&#xD;
that one, or tether one, and it leaves us a hope&#xD;
to cling to.'&#xD;
'I can't see it in the light you do. The&#xD;
thought of half of us being roasted, in the way&#xD;
you hint at, makes me shudder.'&#xD;
'But you must'nt think it's yourself that's&#xD;
goin' to be agonized, but some other onfortu-&#xD;
nate indervidooal.'&#xD;
'I think we shall fight some before any of us&#xD;
will beroasted,' said a settler who had been lis-&#xD;
teningxi4itely to the conversation.&#xD;
'Them's the nater of my own in'ard senter-&#xD;
ments,' responded the trapper, who stood near&#xD;
us.&#xD;
'Wbzen it grows a little darker,' resumed&#xD;
Buston, 'I shall go out and take a scalp, the&#xD;
Lord willin' and the weather permittin'.'&#xD;
&#xD;
'Perhaps so, Brass Eyes. We shall have&#xD;
more knowledge on that perticerler subject arter&#xD;
we know.'&#xD;
When the shades of evening began to gather,&#xD;
Buston loaded, his rifle with great care. He then&#xD;
sat down and smoked a few whiffs of the frag-&#xD;
rant weed with his usual carelessness of manner.&#xD;
He then arose and left the fort, for such I must&#xD;
call it, for want of a more appropriate name.&#xD;
Our horses were all fastened within the breast&#xD;
works,. with the exception of Two Forty, he&#xD;
being allowed to nip the grass without, close to&#xD;
the rampart.&#xD;
'Two Forty come here ; I-want to see a you&#xD;
a minnit, and perhaps more nor that time.?,&#xD;
Two Forty -pricked up his ears, and came&#xD;
briskly towards his master.&#xD;
' Doyou feel willin' to trots me round this&#xD;
'ere holler square, old feller?'&#xD;
Two Forty rubbed his nose against Buston's&#xD;
arm, as if to signify his willingness to trot his&#xD;
master anywhere he might want to go.&#xD;
'I'd recommend you to go as if you'd been&#xD;
somewhat kicked in eend,' continued the trap-&#xD;
per, vaulting upon the highly trained animal.&#xD;
'What in the name o' the Bible are ,,you&#xD;
going' to do ?' asked Gilmore.&#xD;
'Keep down your religious feelin's, Brass&#xD;
Eyes. The Lord willin', and the weather per-&#xD;
mittin', I shall ride out for the gineral benefit of&#xD;

'Like bricks, you mean ?'&#xD;
'I don't mean nothin' shorter,     Ees.&#xD;
Go it, Two Forty.'&#xD;
And Two Forty sprang out of the   fold re&#xD;
like a wild and maddened steed that had never&#xD;
camped the bit, or felt the weight 'of the sad-&#xD;

&#xD;
upon them a deadly volley, which seemed to dis-&#xD;

find us unprepared. For a time the firing was&#xD;
incessant, and the Utah's held their own very&#xD;
well, considering that Indians are not good fight-&#xD;
ers, save in the woods. . In one respect we had&#xD;
the advantage of them; our shots told a tale of&#xD;
death, while theirs rattled harmless, as a gen-&#xD;
eral thing, against the logs raised for our pro-&#xD;
tection. Several of the settlers', wives made&#xD;
themselves useful during the engagement, not&#xD;
unfrequently loading guns. Before morning&#xD;
the firing ceased, and the savages fell back to&#xD;
their mountain fastnesses.&#xD;
Not feeling inclined to sleep, lest we might&#xD;
afford the enemy some advantage, we naturally&#xD;
began to converse upon various subjects relating&#xD;
to Indians, and their mode of warfare. The&#xD;
name of Black Ralph was spoken more than&#xD;
once, when a settler by the name of Gray told&#xD;
the following story :&#xD;
'Before I settled upon the Red Fork of the,&#xD;
Arkansas River, I \vas in the habit of trading&#xD;
with the Indians. I have made many journey&#xD;
from Westport and St. 1ouis, up as far as Fort&#xD;
Laramie, and I have been as far as Fort Wallah&#xD;
Wallah, visiting the various tribes of Indians&#xD;
with whom the whites were on trading terms.&#xD;
During these excursions, I usually joined&#xD;
some fur company, as .it would have been very&#xD;
dangerous travelling alone. The articles of&#xD;
merchandise which I carried would have proved&#xD;
too. tempting to the red men ; I should have&#xD;
been murdered in the first dark pass, or in fact&#xD;
anywhere.&#xD;
About a year and a half ago I left Fort Lar-&#xD;
amie in company with a party of trappers em-&#xD;
ployed by the North American Fur Company.&#xD;
My objet in going so far was to Trade with the&#xD;
Nez Perces, Shoshonies, Bannecks, and othe&#xD;
friendly tribes living near them.&#xD;
When we reached the Southgass, I was ta-&#xD;
ken sick. I awoke one morning after a troub-&#xD;
led sleep, with a dull, heavy pain in the back of&#xD;
my head and limbs.&#xD;
My neck was stiff, my tong ee as dr adn~&#xD;
parched, and my skin was hot and eei~li,"&#xD;

&#xD;
I arose and washed my head in cold wter&#xD;
and strove to shake off the impending sickness,&#xD;
but it was too firmly fixed upon me to be shaken&#xD;
off so easily. When I had walked about a&#xD;
short time, a gloomy, desponding feeling tookI&#xD;
possession of me, and I went into the camp and&#xD;
laid down.&#xD;
The pain in my limbs and head increased,&#xD;
..  and I felt a burning heat in all parts of my&#xD;
frame. I had a fever upon me. The trappers&#xD;
ate their breakfast as usual, and prepared to go&#xD;
on their way.&#xD;
Come, Gray,' said one, ' be lively-it's time&#xD;
to be moving.'&#xD;
I can't help it,' I replied, in. a feeble voice.&#xD;
I'm sick, and can't go any farther.'&#xD;
'He's got a regular fever,' said one. 'It'll&#xD;
be a long time before he'll be able to travel.'&#xD;
'You won't desert me?' I said, with some&#xD;
anxiety of manner.&#xD;
My companions looked at each other in si-&#xD;
lence.&#xD;
'It would be an act of inhumanity to desert&#xD;
; e,' I added.&#xD;
suppose some one of us must stay,' re-&#xD;
plied the leader of the company, at length.&#xD;
'Who will it be ? is the next question,' added&#xD;
another,&#xD;
I will reward the man liberally who stays,'&#xD;
I said.&#xD;
After considerable conversation which 1 could&#xD;
not hear, a Frenchman, who had acted in the&#xD;
capacity of voayaguer in our passage up the Mis-&#xD;
souri, volunteered to remain with me, for which&#xD;
service I was to pay him a stipulated sum.&#xD;
Now I liked this fellow the least of all of them.&#xD;
There was not a single feature of his visage that&#xD;
was not ugly in the extreme. He in fact car-&#xD;
ried one of those villainous faces which marks a&#xD;
man an arrant rogue wherever he goes. With&#xD;
such a face he could not conceal his character-&#xD;
or disguise it for a moment. He was no favor-&#xD;
ite among the trappers. They said little to him&#xD;
and he kept himself sullenly aloof.&#xD;
Ibelieve every one of them was rejoiced to&#xD;
find any kud~ of a pretext to get rid of his com-&#xD;
pany.&#xD;
&#xD;
Such WMs the person who was left to care for&#xD;
me during the weary and dreary hours of sick-&#xD;
ness. A poor companion indeed, even in health.&#xD;
He seemed more willing to tarry than I could&#xD;
have expected ; but there appeared to me, to be a&#xD;
most diabolical smile upon his sinisterlips all&#xD;
th e  w h ile.d                       si t&#xD;
he prod uce d an old black pipe, and sitting&#xD;
down where I lay smoked without interruption&#xD;
for an hour, favoring me occasionally with a&#xD;
glance from beneath his matted and heavy&#xD;
brows.&#xD;
'Do you know much about fevers?' I asked.&#xD;
'Moudien ! I know all about them,' he an-&#xD;
swered, with a hoarse laugh.&#xD;
' Have you any knowledge of roots and&#xD;
herbs ?'&#xD;
'Le diable, I know all about roots and herbs&#xD;
too. Have you got any tobacco?'&#xD;
I attempted to get him some tobacco from my&#xD;
package of good, but I could not.&#xD;
It's in that,' I said pointing.&#xD;
'I'll help myself,' said he ; and in an instant&#xD;
his great red hand was tearing open the pack-&#xD;
age. His eyes sparkled with pleasure, as he&#xD;
beheld the valuables contained therein.&#xD;
I could not help shuddering at the singular&#xD;
expression of his face.&#xD;
' You'll find a lot of the weed there, and you&#xD;
may use as much of it as you like.&#xD;
A grim smile was the only reply to that lib-&#xD;
eral offer.&#xD;
My fever increased during the day. But my&#xD;
strange attendant did nothing but regale him-&#xD;
self with smoking, and it would seem that he en-&#xD;
joyed it amasingly. If I turned restless from&#xD;
side -to side, he smoked; if I uttered Ii moan of&#xD;
distress, still be smoked on unmoved.&#xD;
When noon.came, he replenished the fired&#xD;
cooked a great slice of meat, and ate voracious-&#xD;

he had of eating it made me-sicker t ver.&#xD;

'lEst!' whispered Gilmore.&#xD;
For several minutes we all looked down in&#xD;
silence upon the unsuspecting red men. We&#xD;
drew back and gazed enquiringly at each other&#xD;
in the moonlight.&#xD;
'It's best to have a shot all round,' said I ;&#xD;
'if it proves our last, so be it ; and may heaven&#xD;

'You've got a terrible ugly look about the&#xD;

Some of them wore loading their guns, others&#xD;
were telling of their daring exploits at different&#xD;
es and places ; and a third party was engaged&#xD;
king a buffalo's hump.&#xD;
Tach of us selected our man. The fellow&#xD;
w  hmyheart I covered with the muzzle of my&#xD;

Gilmore, I observed, levelled at one who was&#xD;
relating many acts of bravery, with violent ges-&#xD;
ticulations, and a multitude of words.&#xD;
'Are you all ready?' I asked.&#xD;
All ready !' was the whispered response.&#xD;
Let them have it then,' I -hissed from  be-&#xD;
tween my fixed teeth.&#xD;
We fired simultaneously.  The Indian who&#xD;
was   pouring  powder  into  his palm, fell&#xD;
backward with it still in his hand ; the fel-&#xD;
low who was reciting his bloody deeds, left off&#xD;
in the middle of his story; the one who was&#xD;
roasting the hump, fell across hid own fire.&#xD;
Getting upon our feet, we ran to a spot where&#xD;
the ledge terminated less boldly, and leaped&#xD;
down among the Utahs. They were struck with&#xD;
a sudden panic, and fled from us.&#xD;
' We followed and shot down several with our&#xD;
pistols. Their yells attracted the attention of&#xD;
&#xD;
others who came rushing to their aid. Each of&#xD;
us grappled with a foe, and our hunting knives&#xD;
were soon reeking with crimson gore.&#xD;
The first one I met hand to hand fell beneath  s&#xD;
the well-directed blow j not so with the second ;&#xD;
for he was a strong active savage, and he strug-&#xD;
gled hard for the mastery.&#xD;
We both fell to the ground, and tugging at&#xD;
each other's hearts, dealt furious blows. But I&#xD;
proved the stronger of the two, and when I&#xD;
arose I was grim and bloody, and my knife was&#xD;
quivering in his heart.&#xD;
It's time to go !' cried Gilmore.  ' We've&#xD;
done enough for one night.'&#xD;
Go it, Cattridge-Box !  Give 'em death !'&#xD;
shouted Buston, in his loud ringing tones, at the&#xD;
same instant striking down a savage with his&#xD;
clubbed rifle.&#xD;
Heedless of the warning voice of Gilmore, I&#xD;
sprang at another Utah, and with a dextrous&#xD;
movement buried my knife in his bosom.&#xD;
The trapper and Buston sprang forward to my&#xD;
aid ; for the enemy began to press upon me in}&#xD;
great numbers.&#xD;
Though mirthful on ordinary occasions, Bus-&#xD;
ton was a lion in battle. The enemy gave&#xD;
back.   Gilmore, seized me by the arm  and&#xD;
dragged me away.&#xD;
'Now run.for life!' he exclaimed.     S&#xD;
I hesitated.&#xD;
'Think of Oncnmmon Florry!' said Buston.&#xD;
The words acted like a charm upon me, andF&#xD;
I ran for the fort with a speed that defied suc-&#xD;
eessful pursuit. We had accomplished half the&#xD;
distance when we were startled by a general&#xD;
discharge of fire arms.&#xD;
The enemy had surrounded our fort during our&#xD;
absence, and we were cut off    We made a&#xD;
short halt, loaded our rifles, and with loud shouts-&#xD;
attacked the enemy in the rear, with the fixed&#xD;
determination to force our way to the encamp-&#xD;
ment, or perish in the attempt.&#xD;
This bold manoeuvre took the Utahs by sur-&#xD;
prise.&#xD;
Not knowing our numbers, they probably sus-&#xD;
pected there were many of us. They gave way,&#xD;
and we reached the fort in safety, greatly to&#xD;
&#xD;
the joy of our friends, who were getting extreme-&#xD;
ly anxious on our account.&#xD;
' It'll learn 'em a good lesson,' said the trap-&#xD;
per.  ' They know now what kind of critters&#xD;
they've got to dial, with.'&#xD;
'Oncommon Florry is looking at you,' whis-&#xD;
pered Buston.&#xD;
I looked up and met the gaze of Flora. She&#xD;
averted her eyes instantly, and a faint blush re-&#xD;
lieved for an instant the marble paleness of her&#xD;
face.   .&#xD;
'You'd better, wash your upper story a little,&#xD;
and your hands too. Your present appearance&#xD;
aint jest the sort to please the ladies, by no&#xD;
means,' added the hunter.&#xD;
As 1I passed Flora, to do as my friend sug-&#xD;
gested, she placed a small pocket mirror in my&#xD;
hand. I glanced at it and returned it instant-&#xD;
ly, for I was startled at my own looks.&#xD;
In a short time the firing without ceased,&#xD;
and was not renewed till the next day. At the&#xD;
urgent solicitation of friends, I laid down and&#xD;
slept soundly. jI awoke greatly refreshed,.and&#xD;
endowed with new hope and courage.&#xD;
' The provision is gettin' short,' said the trap.&#xD;
per, when we were alone. 'I've made up myj&#xD;
mind to get out o' this place to-night hnd kill a&#xD;
buffalo.'&#xD;
'That's easier said than done.'&#xD;
'I know it ; but there's nothin' onpossible.&#xD;
Who would have thought that you could have&#xD;
done what you did last night, and live through it;&#xD;
and yet you did live through it; well, what&#xD;
we're talkin' of seems hard to accomplish, and&#xD;
yet it may be done. It's a parallel case.'&#xD;
' I will go with you.'&#xD;
'That's what I was afeared of ; I'd rather go&#xD;
alone.'&#xD;
' What did you ' say?' asked Buston, who&#xD;
joined us at that moment.&#xD;
'We were speaking about going through the'&#xD;
defile in quest of food.'&#xD;
'Two Forty and I are calculated for that&#xD;
kind o' business,' replied thle hunter.  'We'll&#xD;
take the job off from your hands .'&#xD;
Fix it just as you please,' said I, ' only do&#xD;
not expose yourself unnecessarily.' .&#xD;
There was considerable skirmishing during&#xD;
&#xD;
the day, resulting in nothing very important to&#xD;
eitherparty.&#xD;
A dark, stormy night set in. The thunder,&#xD;
heard faintly in the distance at first, now broke&#xD;
over our heads in terrible volleys. The light-&#xD;
ning's flashed along the heavens, and the rain&#xD;
began to descend in torrents. A tree, not far&#xD;
from the encampment, was struck and shivered&#xD;
from the tops to the roots.&#xD;
'It's a fearful night,'.said Flora.&#xD;
' Yes; the demon of the storm and the thun-&#xD;
der rides triumphant. See ! that tree is on fire.&#xD;
What a flash that was!'&#xD;
'It lighted the whole extent of the mountain&#xD;
ranges, and I saw distinctly the faces of our&#xD;
foes,' answered Flora.&#xD;
'The critters are afeared o' thunder. In&#xD;
times like this they think the Great Spirit is an-&#xD;
gry,' said the trapper.&#xD;
'.Perhaps now would be a good time to strike&#xD;
a blow,' I added.&#xD;
'On such a terrible night, as this ?' asked&#xD;
Flora, with faltering accent  'Somehow it&#xD;
seems wrong to seek the lives of our fellow mor-&#xD;
tals while the elements are in such fearful t rn-&#xD;
motion.'&#xD;
'What we do is in self defence, Flora.'&#xD;
Buston now drew Gilmore aside, and they&#xD;
conferred together in a low tone.  I heard the&#xD;
latter say ' I'll see to that,' and soon he left the  -&#xD;
fort.&#xD;
Flora and myelf were left standing alone at&#xD;
the door of the same.&#xD;
'The storm abates nothing of its fury,' I ob-&#xD;
served.&#xD;
'On the contrary it rages with greater vio-&#xD;
lence.  What a fearful crash that was ! It.&#xD;
shakes the mountain ranges, as it goes echoing&#xD;
among them.   Think of the power pf Him who&#xD;
is able to govern even the elements in their&#xD;
fiercest moods.'&#xD;
At that instant a blinding flash illuminated&#xD;
the whole valley, and the rugged elevations that&#xD;
fenced it in.&#xD;
'I thought that flash revealed the figure of&#xD;
a man,' remarked my fair and brave companion.&#xD;
' Of an Indian, you mean.&#xD;

sheet of flame lights up the valley, you will per-&#xD;

I followed her directions, and beheld distinct-i&#xD;
ly the tall form of Gilmore. He was half way&#xD;
up the mountain side. I turned to look ,for&#xD;
Buston.  When I found him, he was painting&#xD;
his face with various strange pigments unknown&#xD;
to me.&#xD;
Where is Gilmore going?' I asked anx-&#xD;
iously.&#xD;
'To git an Ingin dress,' he answered. I'm&#xD;
bound on an expedition, and must have one.'&#xD;
'But how is he to procure one?'&#xD;
'He'll strip one of the dead ones, and if he&#xD;
*an't do no better, he'll use the knife.'&#xD;
'That's a dangerous undertaking. I must&#xD;
follow him. The lightning will reveal him to&#xD;
the enemy.'&#xD;
' So it would you, if you should go after him.-&#xD;
Stay where you are. I'll risk Gilmore where I&#xD;
wouldn't ris    yself.  He'll be back in the&#xD;
oguie of Three quarters of an hour. The var-&#xD;
ints are kind o' bewildered now ; the thunder&#xD;
. d lighining puts a damper on their courage.&#xD;
'You intend, doubtless, to pass -through the1&#xD;
defile to-night?'&#xD;
You've guessed it, my lad. Two Forty&#xD;
and Iare bound to shine.'&#xD;
When he had finished painting, he took a&#xD;
buffalo skin and cut it into several pieces.&#xD;
These pieces he bound on to the feet of Two&#xD;
Forty. He was thus employed when I returned&#xD;
to the side of Flora..&#xD;
'I have been watching the bold trapper,' she&#xD;
said. 'He is walking directly into the face and&#xD;
eyes of the enemy. It is a pity that such a&#xD;
brave  ian should throw away his life.'&#xD;
Again the lightning flashed, and sent its&#xD;
broad glare of light along the mountains; but&#xD;
Gilmore had disappeared.&#xD;
' I failed to see him that time,' remarked&#xD;
Flora.&#xD;
'He'll be more cautious how he advances,&#xD;
probably, as hie approaches them.'&#xD;
The next time hI saw the brave old trapper by&#xD;
the lightning's red lamnp, he waf fighting with&#xD;
the enemy-one mantoo many.&#xD;
&#xD;
RALPH&#xD;
Who will follow ' I cried, and seizing my&#xD;
airms, was rushing from the encampment, when&#xD;
Flora laid her hand quietly upon my arm, say-&#xD;
ing&#xD;
'Stay, Edward.  The old man is victorious.-&#xD;
The last flash of lightning revealed him standing&#xD;
unharmed and alone. There, that flash revealed&#xD;
him returning to us.'&#xD;
Flora was right. In a short time the trapper&#xD;
made his appearance, bearing a small bundle;&#xD;
it was an Indian's dress.,&#xD;
'Three cheers for Brass-Eyes !' said Buston.&#xD;
' Go it, Cattridge-Box !' And three as hearty&#xD;
cheers went up from the fort as ever arose amid&#xD;
the din of a terrific storm.&#xD;
I glanced at Gilmore's hands, and perceived&#xD;
that they were not of the natural color, the blade&#xD;
in his belt was of the same sanguine hue.&#xD;
Buston took the dress without a word of in-.&#xD;
quiry, and soon returned to us the exact coun-&#xD;
terpart of a Utah Indian.&#xD;
He mounted his famous steed, and with his&#xD;
usual-.&#xD;
Go it, Two Forty,' sprang, from the enclo-&#xD;
sure, and soon disappeared in the deep darkness.&#xD;
Gradually the reverberating thunder ceased to&#xD;
break over our heads ; the lightning grew fainter&#xD;
and less vived, and long before morning the&#xD;
storm had passed.&#xD;
The following day the Indians were unusu-&#xD;
ally quiet, and we judged by certain movements&#xD;
which we noticed a general attack that was medi-&#xD;
tated sometime during the coming night.&#xD;
The usual precautions were observed, and all&#xD;
went on quietly until about one o'clock. At&#xD;
that hour the mountain ranges were suddenly&#xD;
lighted by bright fires which streamed up one af-&#xD;
ter another, and seemed to dance about in a&#xD;
singular manner.&#xD;
'That's the work of a white man,' said Gil-&#xD;
more. Them lights are- caused by pitch-pine&#xD;
torches, and they mean to burn us.'&#xD;
' I doubt whether they can make these ma-&#xD;
