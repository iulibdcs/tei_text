PERSONALITIES. BEFORE entering upon the Iserious matter of this veracious history, I have particular reasons  for making an important introductory statement. Certain remarks in the course of the following pages may be misunderAtood, and it is quite im- portant to my future personal comfort that such unfounded deductions should be avoided. Infer- ences very. far from my thoughts may be made, and these lead to unpleasant complications of a domestic nature. There is one peculiarity about the female character which seems to be universal  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7667-00000005"/> 10'      PERSONALITIES. with the sex: they are unable to appreciate a joke, especially where that joke bears a little against themselves. In the first place, then, as a general observation, I beg the entire sex to understand -that whatever there may be in this story whichl they do not approve, is purely jocose r and ironical, intended only as a harmless pleas- -,antry, and to be interpreted solely in a Pickwick- ian sense. And I desire to add as a particular remnark, that I am entirely satisfied, firmly con- vinced, and altogether persuaded, that I have the best wife in the world. Here, then, we start; amicably, I hope,-under- standingly at least; firstly, nothing could be fur- ther from my intentions then-to cast a slur on the sex, withomit which stories like mine--to say nothing of/less important things--would be an impossibility. And secondly, my individual share of the sex is simply perfection intensified. Women as a class have a mission. Our house- holds are their natural happy hunting-grounds. The health'and happiness of the human race are in their keeping, if the theories of inherited qualities are to be believed; and when they take physical improvement into consideration, we   PERSONALITIES. coarser males, who have no nerves and never suffer from weak backs or feeble muscles or thin blood, and are forced to good digestion and healthy sleep by hard work, ought to be gratefully admiring. - It remains for woman yet to prove how a human being can   endure the cares of housekeep- ing, sitting in an easy chair or lolling on a sofa all day long; can improve the mind by the study of thrilling novels or sensational dramas; can support the strain of dressing the back hair and crimping the front; of trying on one liat or dress after another and being disappointed in both'; call torture the soul and heart by, perplexities as to the becomingness of one style of trimming, or to the suitability of one manner of ornament over the other; can pass the entire daylight hours in these severe studies, hidden from the sun, which ruins the complexion, and the wind, which roughens the cheek; resting only at the intervals which are not necessarily passed before the mir- ror; and yet eat three square meals a day, digest them all, sleep from twelve at night to twelve next morning, and never have a symptom  of a back, or a head, or a stomach, as betrayed by un- pleasant aches or pains in such regions. Surely  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7667-00000006"/> 12       PERSONALrITIES. the good women who are striving to solve so dif- ficult, problem deserve the respect of man, and they have mine. May they go on and prosper! The household is the sphere of female tri- umphs, and there my wife shines pre-eminent. Most story-writers deride or belittle the married state; they bring their hero or heroine to that bourne, and leave them there; or else they enter it with the bludgeon of dishonor or the stilletto of treason, and destroy the wife or drive the ,husband to despair. Either total neglect, or else pollution, abuse, ruin, are what they offer to the only relationship in life where perfect happiness, where an approach to unselfish, pure-minded bliss is possible. Of course such a state of Ar- cadian enjoyment can only exist where the wife like mine wills it, and it was only in her creating it that I discovered all her perfections. I al- ways knew she was the prettiest in the world, with the loveliest figure, tinest hands, rosiest mouth, smallestfeet, most massy hair, slimmest ankles-- well, I do not care to go any farther. So much for her personal appearance; that she was also the best, the reader of these pages will have to confess before he gets through. There are other 1     -          -    PER$SO NALTIBS.  *1 good- women, merciful to their husbands and lights to their household, but their lights are not I so good or bright as mine. ence setmineon the hill of 'literature, and -do not allow it to be * hid under a bushel of household drudgeries. Perhaps a small share of her sweetness may be due to my skill in extracting it, like the bee distilling it from the flower. Men bring most of their marital misfortunes on themselves. In- stead of devoting as careful attention to the mar- riage state as they do to their other estate, they. rush in blindly, and, when in, let everything go as it will. They act as if they thought that con' jugal relations came by chance like other rela- tions, and, like them, could not be made better or worse. Instead of that, I was circumspect and judicious, looked the ground over, worked out a wise plan of action,  and, followed it steadily. And here I may as well confess what my system was. It is simple and will not .-take me long. For the benefit of other less fortunate or less informed husbands, my discoveries should be. preserved. Few if any men are acquainted with the peculiar and abstruse methods of thought of the other sex, and my manner of treatment is so  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7667-00000007"/> "      PERSONALITIE'RS. simple and, yet so effective, it is within the power of any one to follow. Woman does not feel, does not argue, does not reason as man feels, argues, and reasons. She is hot moved by his desires, his hopes, his fears. Shle is not only different by nature, but has been brought up in a very differ- ent school. He, in his coarser nature, lras worked, plodded, toiled, submitted, suffered, striven, been knocked about -,and kicked and cuffed through life. She, with her more refined Organization, has been admired, protected, petted, indulged, worshipped, obeyed,--has been- kept from the world, shielded from trial, supplied with what she needed, and covered with the eider down of affection against the cold. blasts of trial and exposure: Following out this process, and deducing its natural consequence, I perceived,; after deep deliberation, what was necessary to make a perfectly happy household. You have but one thing to do, my brother Benedick: just allow your wife to have her own way in every- thing. Perfect obedience wilKNpake a perfect household, but the obedience must be on your side. That is all. Do it, and you will revel in Ely- \.   PERSONALTIES.        15 sinm--an Elysium that a few errors in judgment on your part, or a mistake as to the relation of thousands to hundreds of dollars of outgo and income oil her part, cannot spoil. Do otherwise, and if your house is not like that other place- that place whither the goats go-it will only be onr account of the natural- superiority of woman, over her circumstances,-of the wonderful self- restraint of a creature who  enjoys unlimited power with practically no restraint. I always do it, and I am so happy I want to let the world into a share of my bliss. Nevertheless, I do not wish to claimn too much credit for my plan, or derogate anything from my lovely wife. She is herself rather remarka- ble, and I  am entirely satisfied that there is no other such woman in the world. (By   the way, she is looking over my manuscript now.) She is beautiful. I  know there are many beautiful women ;-that is almost a  matter of course withi the sex.   She is good. Few  wives, thank Heaven, are otherwise. She is bright. Brigl!t- ness seems to be a gift of a large part of the sex. She is sensible. There is a wonderful fund of good sense in woman if she has a chance to dis-   .  .      .  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7667-00000008"/> 16-      PEIRSONALITIES, play it. She is absolutely charming. Nature seems to have conferred all attractive and win- ning manner on women as a contrast to the tire- some stupidity of mnen. She is wonderfully orig- inal in thought. In fact, the very difference in process of reasoning between the sexes makes woman's observations more striking to us. She is intellectually cultivated. Fortunately, educa- tion is growing to be, no longer a question of sex, and each is having its best powers developed by the freest opportunity for study. She is a thor- ough woman of business. This very increased education, however, is making women more prac- tical than they once were. She is truthful and honest. That is almost universal with the female sex, unless opposition to their wishes forces them to indirection: She is domestic. She would hardly be a woman were she not devoted to her family and children.  She loves me.  Most women-I was about td say--do, but I will only remark that there is no reason why she should not. To bring the matter, then, within a shorter compass, I will repeat that she is beautiful, good, bright, sensible, charming, original, cultivated,   PERSOXALITIESi.      17 practical, truthful, ingenuous, domestic--and loves me. That is not half, but it will do for the present. Her other excellences may develop, as they did to me, in the progress of our history. Possibly there may be many such women in the world. I can only say, I hope there are. Nev- ertheless, I consider myself uncommonly lucky to have one of them. We have four children, for it is six years since she put her little hand in mine, and tremblingly whispered "Yes," in reply to a pointed inquiry by a gentleman robed in white, and with a pious book in his hands, whom custom calls the altar. When we were first married, I meant to have named these after my relations, for I have some very superior connections on my mother's side.  The latter and all her family were very Dutch, and I am not a little proud of being related to the Dummkopfs and Donderbergs and Muhles- sels, the Van Damms and Van Boeckhausens and Van Trumps and Van Cowenhovens and Van Benschoetens, and all the rest of them. This was no little source of vanity, and I intended selecting the most respectable of the names, and :  conferring them on such pledges of affection as  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7667-00000009"/> 18      PERSONALITIE.    / the filture might have held in store for me. If there is anything I despise, it is the indistinctive names in common use; your Jack and Jim and Tom and Bob and Nell and Sue. Names that are no names; designations that apply to thou- sands, and distinguish none; appellations which are a sort of common heritage to the -entire human race, some of which, indeed, have come down to us from the days of the Patriarchs, and even of our first parents. They disgust me. Why, there are to-day not less than a million Jacks in existence; perhaps more--accepting the French Jacques as a similar cognomen. And Joes and Kates and Sams-who can count them? My own name has always been a source of vex- ation. of spirit to me. PETERGLL! Peter, it is true, has much that is eminently respectable about t it; and it even possesses in a remote degree, the odor of sanctity. But use has madeit common; it has grown into a houselold word, and Peters have become a species of repeaters. But if Peter is questionable, Pete is worse and unquestion- able. Into the depths of Pete I descended early, and from that thraldom  have never fairly es- ,   PERSONALITIES.       19 caped. Occasionally some enthusiastic friend, in the exuberance of his affection, calls me by a still more offensive diminutive, and actually reduces me to Petey. Against this ignominy I have, however, from 'my earliest infancy stoutly re- belled, and I once made a bitter quarrel and final breach with a dear friend becanse he would continually so far forget himself as to apply this most objectionable of diminutives. Pete- Pete Petey! Ughl! I ealy resolved that my chil- dren, if Heaven blessed me with any, should be spared such ignominy. lNo miserable, contracti- ble apology for a name should torture their in- faltile sensibilities, and cast a blight of mediocrity over their after years. Each should have a good, sonorous, open-vowelled Dutch cognomen, to the extent that I will my capacity of Christian father conld bestow it. My children should be resonant of ildividu alty, at least as far as theirfirst names were concerned. I could not correct the paucity of Gill; the tail end might be slightly fishy, even in its association, but the introductory part of their names should be imposin. It was nec- essary that the beginning should be the stronger ' to make up for the weak ending. The trivial- &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7667-00000010"/> 20      'PERSONALITIES. ity of Gill demanded a powerful anterior sup- port. What could be better for such a purpose than Donderberg or Vanderdonk? In fact, I pre- ferred Vanderdonk, It was more mouth-filling. So I settled on Vanderdonk as the most pleasing and descriptive designation of my first-born That is, when he should come; for this arrange- ment of-mine was'a forethought, and had not been discussed by me with my bride-being left till the occasion should arise. I was entirely sat- isfied that no more original, vigorous, impressive, and unusual designation of -the heir of a family could be found than Vanderdonk Gill. No child could be ashamed of that, or cower be- neath the ridicule of his associates at the petti- ness of his name. A man called Vanderdonk Gill must be distinguished; he was foreordained to make a noise- in the world. There was glori- ous individuality about that appellation; no wretched Jack to be. converted at once, into Jack and Gill by every ironical playmate; no Joseph to be transposed at once into Rosey Gills; but a name that the world would recognizeas belonging to but one person that ever lived or would live.   -, PBSONA ITIES.      21, If the sex should be different, and he should turn out to be a girl instead of a boy, I Lad still abundant resources. In that case, the little rosy dumpling of a pride of the household should start her infant career, npt as a Suke or a Poll, but as a vigorous Vandamma, or a graceful Cowenhova. Either of these would be purely original, and might be adapted to the character of mind or body she bade fair to possess. Vandamma was strong and impressive, while Cowenhova was more effeminate and gentle. Neither of these names, nor Vanderdonk or Donderberg, could be shortened into hateful familiarity. You could not say Cowey or Vanda; or if you did, they were still respectable names; and of course no one would presume to convert Vander- donk into Donkey, or anything of that sort. I was delighted with my scheme, although I was much troubled to choose between Vandammaf and Cowenhova. In truth, I was -still debating the question with myself, and still undecided-so many recommendations did each possess-when an event occurred which quite settled the diffl- culty. My first-born arrived, and turned out to be a male; so Vanderdonk won.  When I heard . 1, 5  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7667-00000011"/> p pER SOALITIES- the news, I surprised the nurse by throwing up my hat-for I had just come in from walling- and shouting "Vanderdolk!" So far I had proceeded admirably; but now a slight difficulty arose. 1My darling wVife, who had not been consulted yet in the iatter, con- sidered that she had something to say about it, and that was decidedly and strongly against my system of nomenclature. She failedtose the beauty in Vanboeckhausen; and as for Van Damm, I am afraid she thought it profane I will not reproduce our discussion of the question; but she seemed to consider babies now much the same as babies had'always been, and as lilkely to be recognized by their names as their predeces- sors in infancy. The result is that my four chil- dren are named respectively, Dick, Bill, Sal, and Moll, and my uncles and grand-uncles have gone or will go to their graves unhonored by serving as guide-posts for our infant line. NeverthelessR I still look upon Bill as a possible Vanderdonk, ald once I came near bringing confusion on my- self by being caught referring to Sal affection- ately as -andamma. Nothing but a. very s- cinct explanation of my absent-mndedness saved   PERSONALITIES.       23. v 4 . me from a fit of nervousness on the part of Mrs. Gill, which might have caused me several sleep- less nights and uncomfortable days--nervous :ex- citability being the one unfortunate weakness of my darling wife, and liable to be brought on by sudden shock or gross blundering on my part; for, - in spite of my knowledge and experience, I do lblunder once in a while. It appeared that my angel misunderstood my term of endearment for something very different, and thought I was ad- dressing our treasure in the reverse of approving language. It sometimes seemed to me that her opposition to my views on family names,-for she, as I have said, was so sensible and reasonable on all sub- jects,-was due to collateral incidentals rather than to the underlying principleof the sysem itself. For instance, she may have'formedJan unjust and unreasonable prejudice against the occiup- tion of some of my excellent relatives. Neither of us were mercenary; she would not do me the injustice to suspect me of that; moreover, there was no opportunity for the least foundation for such a charge. Dutch men and women are pro- verbially a prolific race, and my family was fully  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7667-00000012"/> % 2      PERSONALITIES      . up to the reputation of the nation. y one of nmy uncles or grand-uncles had less than ten children, and he had lost his wife young, and was expected soon to supply her place ald com- plete his perfect work. So there was nothing source to which I have referred. They were sturdy, sensible Dutchmen; in fact, I inherit many of tieir qualities myself, being at heart an intense admirer of Vaterland; and in choice of occupations in life, they had picked out such as were most profitable, withbut much regard to elegance or the prejudices of society. :one of us were ever very high in the realms of fashion; still the fact that Vanderdonl keeps a corner grocery, and that Vanboeclhausen has a large sor-Lkrout establishment, and that my great uncle, old Vandatm, sells sausages, may have warped ]Mrs. Gill's usually excellent judgment. True, the Vanderdonk's grocery has the best Lim- burger and Schweitzer lise, the hardest Dutch- mer's heads, and the richest lager bier in the   PERsONALITIES.       25 city. The sour-krout of Vanboeckhausen can be distin, guished a mile off by its fragrance, and Vandamm's sausages are the thickest, toughest, and most strongly flavored to be founld anywhere this side of Bologna. Nevertheless, M rs. Gill may have taken a dislike to perpetuating the names in consequence of these associations. Not that we had especial cause to be proud. I was not rich when we married, and we might not have been above riding out with the young Vanderdonks in their grocery wagon on' a Sun- day, if they had asked us. - We had to begin life in a small way, by taking a moderate twenty-foot house over onl the west side of the town- and not in the most fashionable part either. This was a piece of great good luck to me, for in this way I found out my wife's first best quality-I learned that she was a thorough woman of business. These explanations and introductory remarks hlave led me a little ahead of my story. They were necessary for the reader's instruction and my own safety.  They show the views that I possessed at the time of entering into matrimony ; they remove the risk of misinterpretation, explain the purpose of my story, and prove why I have 2  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7667-00000013"/> 26      PERSONALIZIES. recorded this true statement of the acts and con- clusions of a wife who has always shown lier- self a model of her sex, and whose-example and experience will be of vast interest and bene- fit to man and woman kind. It was. but nat- ural that she should test many of the new dog- mas, theories, and inventions of- the day; it was inevitable that her busy mind should set itself to solving many'problems which are above the reach of the less gifted; and hence I record her conclusions as a benefaction to the human race, exhibiting at the same time all the lovely traits of character (and sometimes incidentally of person) which go to make up this dearest and noblest of women, who thus by her nature and her actions raises a loftier standard for her sex. (She has been looking over my shoulder once more to see how I get on.)   CHAPTER- II. WE BEGIN LIFE. I a:D found a house, partly furnished, large enough and to spare for o"ur wants, when it was un- derstood that society should have no part in dictat- ing what those wants should be. The furniture and carpets I purchased from the landlord after a severe struggle with him over the price; and although I was convinced afterwards that I was wofully cheated, I kept that fact carefully from the knowledge of my wife, and always assumed towards her'an air of wonderful business ability. Nevertheless, I made a virtue of allowing lher to take charge of household matters thereafter, on the ground of my bei ngrossed with more im- portant cares, and no longer able to devote mv mind to them, and that, having provided the shel- ter and housekeeping articles, I had done my part. Consequently I  graciously transferred the running of the establishment to her hands, giving her my advice and assistance occasionally, to see that she  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7667-00000014"/> 28     .

"My dear," I said, "it is a pity that Uncle Van- derdonk lives so far from here,--no neawer thian First Avenue--so-that it is really out of the question for you to deal there. - He would naturally treat you fairly, and let you have what we shall want, cheap. As it is, however, you must do the best you can with the shopkeepers in this neighbor- hood. We all have to learn, and must not worry ourselves over a mistake now and then.2" My eyes falling on the carpet at this momlent, I was reminded of a case in point, but did not refer to it as an illustration. "If you won't be angry when I blunder," said my pretty wife in reply, with the sweetest little reproachful air i! the world. "No," I replied with the carpet still on my mind. "Not at all; no one beside Minerva,- who sprang armed at all points from Jove's hlead, was born wise. We. have to acquire knowledge with  experience." I often have recourse to a classical quotation: it betrays superior learning, and has a good effect on a young wife.      "  "Promise," she said, coming up to me and .         .     .   WE BEG-IN LIE.       29  looking me straight in the eyes. I did so, and she sealed it in a way that made me regret I had not occasion to be promising every five minutes all day long. "And now," she added, "I will begin, for I suppose you will be wanting something for your dinner; men always do. They pretend they can live on love; but try them, and they beg for roast-beer. Before marriage the world is one big heart; its very atmosphere is romance, andthey exist in a dream of happiness. But after marriage, they prefer liver, especially pate defoie gras, and want plum-pudding and wine-sauce to give life any zest. Go down town, make plenty of money, and leave me to spend it. Let an American girl alone for that." There was an unseemly air of levity about tlis answer, for in fact nothing is more serious than the spending of money, unless it be the earning of it, which is rather the more solemn and by far the. more difficult affair of the two. I felt like uttering a caution; but was already beginning to practise my golden rule of household government; - and so, suppressing any. objection, did as I was told. That evening when I returned I saw my wife  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7667-00000015"/> 30  .    WE BEGIN LIF. was greatly elated. At such times she has a busy, nervous, excited way with her that I can recog-' nize at once. All thlrougch the dinner I perceived it; she was so full of some news that she could scarcely enjoy her meal or contain herself in pa- tience till it was over. But I waited, giving no sign of intelligence till she should be ready to open her budget. I told her what I had been en- gaged upon, but she paid little attention to me. I gave her the general news, but she seemed com- paratively uninterested.' I hadc *recourse to the weather, but doubt if she heard metat all. When the meal was over and we were alone together in the evening, she began: "I commenced my housekeeping arrangements to-day," she said, with a pretty air of self-conscious confusion which in the female language means-"I have done something remarkable; praise me now." "Have you, my dear a "I responded; "I hope it was pleasant and satisfactory?" "You know that grocery-store round the corner on Sixth Avenue," she went on without heeding me -" the handsome, stylish one with so many boxes of tea and such a pile of sugar in the window?" I was about to declare total ignorance of the exis .   WE BE IN   LIFE.      31 ence of this superior establishment, when she in- terrupted me--"Don't say you did not notice it; any one with eyes in his head must have observed it. Well, the profusion of that tea and sugar satisfied me that the people there must do a large business and on a generous scale;-small dealers are invariably close," she added oracularly, " and I always prefer large establishments." Considering the extent of her experience, I felt that no one could be quicker in drawing conclT- sions, and began to appreciate the qualities in my wife which Hafterwards learned to admire so highly. I had, however, secret doubts in my own mind as to the contents of those convincing boxes of tea -and the solidity of that apparent mass of sugar. She proceeded: I wanted to lay in a stock of things for the hlouse, and was looking for a good place, when I was attracted by the appearance of this store. The lower part of the window was filled with sugar, just as if there was no other place to stow it, they had so much, and around this were rows     ' . of boxes of tea, with angels and demons and all manner of strange devices painted on their green   -X sides in bright red colors, producing such a pretty - ,'/i  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7667-00000016"/> 32      WE' BEGIN LIFE. and striking effect. Above these, again, were shelves of tantalizing preserves, or piquant pickles, or mysterious sauces. Back of them, as a sort of sombre setting, were cans of tomatoes, peaches, green peas, preserved meats, and all sorts of good things, so attractive that I should have liked to purchase them all, and lay in stock enough for a lifetime of good eating.  ' An uneasy movement on my part apparently suggested my possible thoughts to her mind, for she answered without a pause: "Don't be alarmed; I resisted and fought the demon Appetite. I stood on him and stamped him in the dust, and cut off his head with the sword of economy, just like St. George and the dragon, in the church picture. I gave him no mercy, not I. Fortunately, I had eaten a hearty breakfast, and could laugh at him, and despise him, and put him under my feet; Perhaps if I had gone there some hours later, I might have been in more danger ; ,but as it was, I came out of the fire, like those long-named gentlemen in Scripture, un- singed. By the way, why didn't they take some easier names for that story? The moral would have been just as good, and then we gould haw   WE BSEIT LIE. 3-      33. renernroered it. Now I always forget who they were, and feel wicked when I can't help thinking of them as Jones, Smith, and Robinson."  It seems to me that mny wife says the most piquant things, in the world, and I am delighted at hearing her talk, and never grow tired listening to her. This is extremely fortunate for both of us.  "Never mind that, however, now," she went on. "Those historical personages had a furnace of their own, and are inot connected with our' household fires. The grocery man's name was Davis, and I could not pass the store without stopping to gaze longingly into the window and debate with myself whetler I had not better go in and there lay in a stock for the coming months. Fate willed it so ;-I believe in fate. Just see how many circumstances combined to bring me to that shop! You had to rent this house just- at this time. There are thousands of others equally good, probably, which you might have taken. If you had chosen any other, then, I should not have e been in this street, and would have found some other place to deal' at, no doubt. Then, fate willed that when I went out, I should walk over 2*  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7667-00000017"/> ,4  '    WE BEGIN LIPFE. toward Sixth Avenue, instead of down towards Eighth, which is also a business street. I went there afterward to see, a nd then I might have  turned up-town or crossed over the way. In fact, it is wonderful how many events had to unite in order to secure our valuable custom for Mr. Davis." "Yes, dear,' I interrupted, "we had to be married ; you have forgotten that; and born, and our precise ancestors had all to be born and mnar- ried. Indeed, you might trace our dealing with  Davis directly as a consequence of Adam's fall, and draw a close connection between our dinners and Eve's eating the fatal apple. You might go farther and thank the' Evil One,' through his representative serpent in the garden of Eden, for bringing you to the store of Mr. Davis."  She went on without much notice of my refined distinctions. "Just as I was standing there, gazing like a  gawky in the window, a clerk opened the door.  One feels very awkward to be caught, as it were, even in so innocent an amusement as ogazing , into a window which has been expressly got up to be gazed into. So I thought I had better pre-   WE' 4fKL 7JN BE LE'ji.   35 -V tend I had made up my mind to buy. something; I could go in, anyway, and see what their prices were."  This being probably the first occasion in which she had ever priced an article in the grocery line, I had some secret doubts which I did not utter, whether she would gain much information by her investigation. oa Besides, the clerk was very gentlemanly and handsome, and was quite dressed up, re- gardless of expense. H-e had an honest, open countenance, and called me 'Miss,' when he asked whether he could  do anything for me.  He was very obliging, too;, told me the prices of everything, and advised me which to buy. Some of the camled goods he told me were old, and I had better have nothing to do with them; while others, he said, were just fresh in. He was very useful, and suggested to me quite a number of articles whiel I should have forgotten, and spent a good hour with me going over the entire stock, and even gave me a full history of the affairs of his Iboss, as he called him. It -appears they have just moved there. (See: that is another contingency which fate or-   &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7667-00000018"/> 36      WE BEGIN LIFIE. dained had to happen.) That they had been down- town previously, but that, as residences were all moving up-town, they had to go too; and now they had to get almost wholly a new set of cus- tomers, and were willing to be very liberal -to the right sort of people. I tools it for granted he meant me as one of the ' right sort of people,' and he proved I was right by what he did afterward. Well, I made all ,my selections: there were crackers and mushroom catsup and butter, rais- ins,potatoes, rice, beans, canned fruits of all sorts, mustard, pickles, some preserved meat'--whch, he said, were very good to have in the lhouse if we should run short and forget-to order from the butcher, some day,-pepper, horse-radish, candles, milk, tea, sugar,-I can't remember them all now by heart, but I never knew before it required so   many different articles from such widely separate parts of the world to sustain a Christian house- hold. Why, I must have ordered specilens of the productions of every quarter of the globe, and from every degree of latitude from the equator to the north pole." My wife is remarkable in drawing unusual and striking inferences. Most people go on   WE BEGIN LIFE.      37 eating and drinlking, taking breakfast, dinner, and tea in rotation, day after day their lives through, without being struck by the number of places which are laid under contribution to supply their meals or add to their comforts. Now she, at the first dinner she ever ordered, noted this remarkable but generally neglected fact. "I had plenty of money, thanks to my hus- band's liberality "-(at this point there was a momentary interruption to the story which need not be noticed; she continued immediately:)- "I had made up my mind it was best to lay in a good stock to begin with, as I was not afraid of the bill. While they were making it up, I took out my roll of bank-notes to be ready to pay; but the gentlemanly and handsome clerk immedi- ately asked me, in his most insinuating manner, whether I would not like to hIave ' a book.' This was rather an unexpected question.  Wbhat sort of a book there was on groceries, what manner of light reading in the matter of candles, or sweet romance about the sugar of life, or story entitled, 'Raisins; their use and abuse,' or else what heavy and learned tome on the nature and  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7667-00000019"/> 38      WE BEGIN LIFE. growth of teas, coffees, crackers, and such serious things was to be offered for my perusal, I could not tell. I felt rather offended that he should show his appreciation of my ignorance, by inti- mating that I had better read up on the subject. Looking at him sternly, I was about to reply that I had books enough at home without asking his advice, and fancled I was considerably better up in literature than he, or his boss' r either, when he hastened to explain that he meant an account-book, in which everything would be written down, and which I only need send round by a servant if I did not want to come out myself; and, above all, which I teed not pay till the end of the month. There! what do you think of that-an offer of credit from the first store I entered . " By this time the reader will have perceived that my wife is a fluent and entertaining talker. I should call her a conversationalist, if that were not another name for bore; but she always pults so much spirit, life, and charm into her words, and so avoids what is pedantic and oppressive, that I never tire of listening to her, and she knoxv t. T 9ave forgotten to mention that this \   WE BE GIY LIFE.      8a conversation took place whtile she was seated on my knee, an attitude which tends to increase the pleasure of all conversations with a pretty woman, and made hers doubly agreeable. "I was pleased at this mark of confidence," she went on, " but did not let them see it, taking the proposition of grocery-books as an every-day affair with me, although I thought to myself: If you trust everybody in that way,'Mr. Davis, you will not be long for this mercantile world. I was rather offish, and had to be persuaded to keep a book, and made them bring the head lnan, the 'boss' himself, out of a back office, a little corner windowed off from the rest of the store, where he sat like a big spider all by hiin- self. He was very complimentary and urgent. ' We shall be so pleased, Mrs. Gill,'-for I had given' them my name and address to send the things home by ;- I amn sure it will save you trouble. RIainy'days, you know, it is so disagree- able going out, and servants cannot always be trusted with money, even when they have been a long while in the family.'

There was delicious triumph in the happy way, in which she uttered those last words and in the air with which she produced the book, that up to that time she had kept carefully concealed in the pocket of her dress, to be brought out only as a crowning effect. She. now held it up before me with immense pride, not yet willing to have it pass out of her hands till she had further expatiated on its attractions. "There! look at my name on the cover set in a halo of flourishes, an aureole of notes of admli- ration: ' Mrs. Peter Gill.' When I first saw it written and ornamented so beautifully, I wished it was longer; there would have been more of it and a better chance for display." She gazed at it critically with her head on one side, holding it at arm's length, and I ventured to" suggest: "Mrs. Yakobus Vanboeckhausen would have suited you better, perhaps." "No nonsense! I am serious; it is too short!" she answered, without taking her eyes off it. "I am really grieved to the heart," I re-   WE BEGIN L I E.   sponded; "and will, willingly apply to the legis- lature to lengthen it. That can be easily done by adding a syllable or two. Call it Gilly, or Gil- bert, or Gilliflower. Gilliflower is quite poetical," "Never mind," she continued, ignoring my suggestion. "It is all the quicker to write. But isn't that a nice little book, bound in leather, and with 'Davis' printed on the back in large type. I tell you what,: as I carried that little book. home, I felt myself at last a responsible and re- spectable member of society-one who could com- mand confidence and whom it was desirable to know. That book is a tribute to the honesty of my appearance, and I shall always keep ith as an endorsement of ly respectability. I am inter- ested in the outside, Davis is interested in the inside. See! there are two pages covered already. Here is the first item: '  Two pounds of Gruyere cheese ;'-at least I know it is two pounds be- cause he told me it was well to get a good supply at once, for it would keep forever. I think it will, if you only eat such a miserable scrap as you took at dinner. But he writes 'pounds' double ' b' and an ' s,' or something of that sort, and no one would ever guess what he meant. And  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7667-00000021"/> 42      WE 1BEGIN LIFE. there is a, box of raisins. I told you I goe some raisins. I thought a box was too much, but he said they -were good to '-put in puddings and cakes, and they will keep too. Here is a gallon of acid. What sort of acid did he say it was a I am sure I forget, but I know it is to clean the boiler. I hope out'girl won't think it is to go into the cake. I must not forget to tell her about that. But you don't seem to be as much pleased as I ex- pected you would be." As she said this she put down the book, which she had all the while held in her hand, as she pointed out its beauties and the items it contained to me, and looked me in the' face,; while a troubled expression of pain came into her gentle eyes. I made haste to reply: "I assure you it is an' excellent plan, and will save you much annoyance." "That is not the truth," she answered, for she has an awful way of reading my thoughts. "You are concealing something." "Indeed," I said, as honestly as I could, "C when 'a person has to begin housekeeping there are so many things to get, that one cannot be running out for them all the while."   WE BEGIN LIFE.       43. Her searching eyes never left my face. Oh what would we not give if we men could only lie like a woman! "And after the beginning is over?" she asked resolutely. I stammered and blundered, never having been endowed by nature with a grain of tact, and managed to blurt out: "I think the grocers are apt to overcharge, and the servants sometimes get things for themselves. Credit of any sort has to be paid for. Still, you were perfectly right, and for a time will find it the best way." "Are there overcharges here?" she asked. Dear me! I began to get extremely uncomnfort- able. Oh for a good, honest, convincing, well-'. uttered, satisfactory falsehood! mWhat did I care for the money, the trumpery difference between the charge and the true value! -But I felt as though I were in the place of Davis himself; as if I were the guilty shopkeeper, the deluding rascal, who had so skilfully led on my wife into petty extravagances. I wanted to connect his name with that of my uncle Vandamim, and be done with it. "Are the prices overcharged " she   asked  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7667-00000022"/> 4  A     'WE BEGIN LIFE. again, her cheeks blazing red and her eyes flash- ing fire. "Who cares, darling, if they are - You have done very well. If there is any overcharge, it is of no consequence.  Tell me what else you- did." "I will find out!" she said, and she clenched her little fist it a way that convincedme she would, and that it would be bad for Davis when she did. Some weeks expired, and I heard noth- ing more about Davis and the account-book. Mrs. Gill was busy over her household affairs; she had purchased numerous diminutive ledgers,- in which all expenditures -were entered with painful regu- larity, and and aon them I somewhat lost the run of the particular case that first attracted my at- tention to the wonderful gifts of my love and wife as a woman of business. One day, however, without any warning or preparation, which seems to be a habit of hers, while she was in a loquacious mood and I was enjoying the pleasuredfone of her confidential talks, she suddenly reverted to the subject. "You remember that villain Davis, who cheated me so abominably while pretending to give me   WE BEGIN LIFE.       45 withont charge, such a beautiful pass-book. Well, I HAVE BEEN REVENGED ON IIIA." Here she had to pause, to let her forthcoming story gather weight, and to take a full breath to last her through.  "You recollect how, when I showed you the book, you cast out base insinuations to the effect that I had been cheated. I hate people who only give illtimations or innuendoes, and who won't speak out like men. Besides, I don't believe you knew anything about it; but it is always in order to ridicule women and pretend that we - cannot keep accounts. I believe women can be just as methodical and use money to just as much advantage as men. T   sure, the figures won't always add up but it  e business of men to make them add 1up. What is a man for in the house but that?  Here she paused, and her mind reverted to the case in point. "Well, the very next day after you said that, before I bought another thing of Davis, or had another charge made in his beautiful book, I quietly went into as many as six grocery-shops, and made minute inquiries as to the price of   &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7667-00000023"/> "      WE BEGIN LIFE. every article H'had purchased. Ill some instances I was cruelly snubbed by the elegant clerks when I lightly flitted from subject to subject, demanding to know the cost of everything and buying nothing, but I persevered. I felt that in the person of Davis the entire grocery-trade had inflicted an imposition upon me, and I was deter- mined to take it out of them.  Gentlemanly clerks might sneer, and shop-boys might snub, but I was relentless as avenging fate. So I ac- complished my purpose, and found out that I had been most infamously and outrageously imposed upon by that imposing clerk of that, impostor Davis; that I had paid double for every"'bottle of sauce, jar of pickles, can of vegetables, pound of dried fish or flesh, bar of soap, paper of tea, jug of molasses, quart of nuts, and small-measure of fruit which I had bought there and laid in as my foundation-stock of family supply; and that I had been most profoundly, shamefully, disgrace- 'fully, unmercifully, and enormously cheated on my very first day of housekeeping." The energy of passion with which these culmi- nating epithets were hurled forth, so exhausted Mrs. Gill's strength, that she had to rest for a   WE BEGIIN LIFE.      47 moment in order to recover her breath. Not for long, however ; the memory of her wrongs urged her on : But I was avenged. I had several distinct and delicious revenges. Item first: I PAID DAVIs. 1 was no longer a poor grub creeping along in the darkness of ignorance, through the land of gro- ceries. I had won my spurs, and was not to be maltreated with impunity. And owhen I paid him, I gave him a piece of my mind. With my money, I delivered to him sundry remarks. I told- him my opinion of him. I presented him with nu- merous predictions as to his future career, not complimentary nor favorable. I talked to him, and with not that amount of politeness which the usages of society ordinarily demand, and I fol- lowed your plan of innuendo and insinuation." She suddenly. turned on me, and though I in- stantly assumed a smiling air of ime'"iity, I did not altogether escape, as her next words proved: "Not that ;I approve at all of such a style of conversation, but I thought it was worthy of him. But that is not all. My vengeance is like Byron's vigil' long of him that treasures up a wrong.' ,' The contrast of the little thing some five feet *.         , ^ *.  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7667-00000024"/> WE BEN1N LIJFE. two inches tall and a hundred and ten pounds-in weight, who sat beside me, with the greatness of her wrongs, was almost amusing, but I did not laugh. Husbands rile feeble creatures even be- fore embqdiments of only one hundred and ten pounds weight, and five feet two inches height. Her big eyes were flashing fire; her rosy cheeks were of deeper red; her pearly teeth were visible between the parted lips, and her tiny hands were clenched into wee but threatening fists. I do not know how Davis felt, but I own I was afraid of the little ball of living fire. She went on, how- ever, without noticing mle: Item number two:' I KEPT HlIS HIIANDSOME AC- COUNT-BOOK. I use it to jot down household ex- peinditures, and take a double pleasure whenever I enter an item of groceries that I do not buy from him. It is a case of retributive justice to use the pass-book of the swindling grocer Davis, to enter sums paid to some other grocer for things which I should have bought from him had he been only conscionably honest. I shall keep that book as long as we liie, as a monument to the ex- cellence of honesty and as convincing proof of the truth of the maxim as to the good policy of that   virtue. I shall preserve it as an heirloom, and hand it down to my-  Perhaps, however, I shall never have a chance." At this point Mrs. Gill's mind seemed to wan- der a moment, and there appeared a blush on her cheeks and neck which was not wholly due to rage, for it must be rememberedthat this was be- fore Dick, Bill, Sal, and Moll had put in an ap- pearance. But she recovered herself at once, and proceeded with the case of Davis, which was really becoming quite tragic: "Item number three: I go by Davis's store whenever I can. I make it a point, even if I have to walk somewhat out of my way, to pass and re- pass his door; often I stop and gaze calmly and indifferently into his gorgeous windows, and gloat over the fact that his shop is customerless, gor- geous as it is, and let them see tha I am g/ting over it, and am not going to buy of them, but am going to expend my money with their worst rival, the man who does business on the next block, whose store is not so magnificent, but who has ten times as many customers because his prices are reasonable, even if his clerks are not handsome, and have no manners, and always call a woman 8 &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7667-00000025"/> 50      WE BEGIN LIFE. M[rs., and never by any chance say Miss. Some- times I carry home pounds of tea, or coffee, or other edibles done up in the horrid dirty brown paper they invariably use in the grocery-shops. I don't know why, for it always tears and spills out the tea, or lets the sugar dribble over the side- walk, so you can trace me all the way home by what I suppose Fenimore Cooper would call I my trail'; or else it bursts the moment you put it down on the sideboard, especially if there are hazel-nuts in it, and then the nuts run all over the floor, and under the table, and I never find half of them again, and the rest trip us up for a week afterwards, till Mary sweeps the room or her lit- tle daughter comes up to see her, who invariably finds them without the least trouble, and craclks themr with her teeth."5 At this point, it seemed to me for a moment as if the question of nuts and brown paper might so distract Mrs. Gill's attention, that the case of Davis would be dropped, and I was about inter-  I polating a remark or two commendatory of lier action. However, this rather unusual course on my part--for the character o(f listener on my part suits both myself and my wife better,-was un.     e   WE BEGIN LIFE.        51 ' necessary, as it seemed that she was not done with -her enemy of the pickles and sauces yet. "Item the fourth and last: Yesterday, as- I stopped at Davis's shop on my customary round, I had an unexpected gratification. A bill was plasteired right in the middle of the gorgeous shop- window, with the ominous inscription 'This store to let. Stock a nd fixtures for sale.' Not two months after the infamous extortion he had prac- tised on me had retribution overtaken him. Oh, the ways of the transgressor are indeed hard! Then I knew that Davis was a doomed, a dreary, dismal man; his sin had found him out. Fare- well to his tea-chests and sauce-bottles and pre- serve-cans, his mountains of sugar and acres of coffee; farewell to his stock and  fixtures, his swindling prices and gorgeous ornaments and obliging clerlks; farewell, a long farewell, to all his greatness. His fate was fixed; his future should be a'warning th all grocers about to im- pose upon young housekeepers opening accounts with them, and whose innocence they wish to de- lude with attractive pass-books and  complimen- tary clerks.

' Stock and fixtures for sale.' The auctioneer will come. In a day or two I shall see the red flag at the door. I shall attend that sale. No checating me then. I know the prices now as well as he does, and besides, the sale will be at open competition, and no one can delude others with fine manners or expressive. eyes and lovely looks. Nobody will say ' Miss' then; and I am determined to get even with Davis, by buying the stock of Davis as cheap from the auctioneel as Davis himself made me pay dear for it. I want to walk around among his gorgeous stock contemptuously. I shall kick the celestial creatures disporting them- selves 'on his delusive tea-chests; I will taste his dried fruit, and make a face as if it were nasty, and will toss over boxes of sardines or cans of preserved fruits as if they were of no value what- ever. I will lay in enough of his stock and fix-   'WCE BEGIN, LIEE.     53 tures to last us for years, and do not care if the codfish does get mouldy and the cheese lively and the canned fruit sour before we use them: I shall have themn cheap enough to make up for the mean swindling he first made me stffer. He thought to give ranother example of man's superi- ority over women, in his ability so cheat her, to take advantage of her inexperience, to use the accident of his bringing-up to her injury.' But justice is on our side, and fortune favors the true."' I felt this was hardly fair to our sex, and should have liked to interfere and point out to Mrs. Gill that it was only one man who had deceived her, while, from her very account, it was clear that the others had been honest; but I had no time, for she suddenly turned on me. "And you too, moyhusband,-you sneered at me. Don't say you didn't! you may not have spoken the words, but you, sneered in your heart. 'An- other case of woman's economy,' you said to yourself; 'Send theml to a training school,' you thought, 'before they are allowed to marry, that they may make useful wives.' Don't spare me. You were right too; women ought to know more  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7667-00000027"/> WE BEGIN LIZFE. than they do. I believe in refrms; I shall try some, for I am sure there is truth in them; but the first reform  is of our own ignorance. Don't be afraid but I shall economize on Davis yet." With this threat she closed, and I was unwill- ing to suggest that unless she was careful, her purchases might not effect that object, and that she might buy a vast mass of groceries, which would spoil before we could use them. In her excited and somewhat belligerent state, silence seemed to me the'wisest course, especially as I fuly endorsed her views on reform.  Women's rights, the demand for votes, and pants, and offices were one thing, but the solid improvement of female education, instruction in what would be useful in the household in saving moneyS or super- vising servants, or overseeing dinners, was another, and in my sense of male superiority I was glad to find Mrs. Gill inclined to the latter. "' Husband," sid Mrs. Gill to me some Weeks after the above iterview, "what do you think of lottery-tickets ?" " Why," I ieplied .jocosely, "that depends upon circumstances. What I think of lottery-   WE BEGIN LIFE.             55 tickets is determined by the fact as to whether I am a seller or purchaser." "Seller!" cried Mrs. Gill with a laugh.  You a seller! I wish you could be. You able to offer prizes of $100,000 and other prizes of $10,000, and hundreds of prizes of thousands of dollars! That would be pleasant; and then I should not have to economize nor count my house-money every week and eat cold meat every Monday." "I am sure you do not have to eat cold meat," I responded rather indignantly to this reproach. "Whether I am rich enough to be a lottery or not, you have always said you preferred cold roast beef to warm." "Well, perhaps I do; but that does not answer my question about lotteries. I want to know what you think of buying a ticket in one." " I think it -would be a very foolish perform- ance; most of them are frauds, and the others only divide about half the money they receive among those from whom they get it." "Still somebody must make money," persisted my wife. "If a person pays fifty dollars for a ticket and draws a prize of one hundred thousand dollars, he certainly makes money."   &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7667-00000028"/> 5 6  .   WE BEGIN LIFrE. ' "The chances of the tare a lhundred thousand to one against him," I responded. "That makes no difference; they do win some- times. I heard of a case where a man was in the same store with another man who once picked up a pocket-book, in Broad way, with nothing chut a single ticket in it, and that drew a prize of eigh- teen thousand dollars the very next day. I don't know any better way to make money than that, especially for a woman, who is prevented by the absurd and unreasonable customs of society from working. Then, the last great Hlavana lottery was won by a poor man, who went crazy and died in a lunatic asylum within a week, because he had won two hundred and fifty thousand dol- lars. I am sure I should never become a luna- tic if I were to win a million." "You surely have not been buying a lottery- ticket?"I inquired,amazed. "Yes," replied Mrs. Gill, brazenly, but with a blush nevertheless. "You know how lucky I am in money matters. If. Thiers says it is better to be born lucky than ricl.

"But what has all that to do with a lottery- ticket?" I asked solemnly, not approving of wasting money in any such ldoubtfull ventures.

You know, besides, how I al- ways have: lucky davys. Monday is my lucky day, and Wednesday and Friday,--no, not Friday; Friday is inever a lucky day for anybody. It is Thursday, or Saturday, I forget which, bult it is one or the other; that is no matter, as I bought my ticket ion Monday. I had a little money over last month out of my dress allowance, and savings-banks give sucl ridiculously small inter- est, only six dollars on a hundred for a whole year, that is only three pairs of gloves or half as much for fifty, whereas I might have won a hundred thousand. So I determined to buy a ticket inJ a lottery. I did not ask you about it, because that brings bad luck: you must never take anybody's advice, if you want to win. I dreamed three nights running of the same numn- ber, and always on Monday; so I was perfectly certain to win. I looked in the newspapers to find a good lottery for, as I told you, you must never ask any one's assistance,-and chose thy Royal South American, of British Columbia,-with agents all over the world and head-quarters in New. York, as the advertisement said,--because , /            .   WE E GIN L IFE.      59 it gave the largest prize and was to be drawn the soonest. The dlerk showed me the list of those who bad won the prizes at the last drawing, and told me that a woman--a common washerwoman -had take the highest, and been made rich for life. I suppose he must have thought I was a washer- woman too; any,! way I am poor enough. For- tunately he had the lucky number left. It was twenty-two hundred and twenty-two, and he said a man had called and wanted to buy it, but had not enough money with him just then, and was coining back soon for it, but that I tnight have it, if I paid at once, as his rule was, first ( colle, first served. So I took it immediately, and here it is." She extracted the piece of paper from the in- most recesses odf her pocket-book iu a hesitating sort of way, which gave me time -to inquire: "And when does the drawing come off '" "That is -the trouble," she replied, still more hesitatingly. "It was to have come off before this, but the man ran away, and his shop is closed. That is a great pity, for I am sure I should have won. It was a fine lottery too, ac- cording to the papers, but I am afraid the man  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7667-00000030"/> 60      WE BEGIN LIFE. was a rogue. Perhaps he may come back-; but it is discouraging when one tries to save a little money, to have it slip away in such a fashion. And I was so sure of winning, that it makes it a double pity. I shall never feel like economizing again." I am sorry to say that "the man," as Mrs. Gill called him, never did come back; that the "Royal South American Lottery of British Columbia" never had a drawing, and consequently Mrs. Gill never won the prize that her combination of lucky dreams and lucky days was certain to se- cure for her, had the drawing only taken place. A drawing is quite anoessential to a great success in investing in lottery-tickets, and her attempt at economy could not be wholly condemned in con- "sequence of a failure which was entirely beyond her control. So, although -Mr. Davis did cheat her, and the lottery failed to reach its final con- sumlmation, it was perfectly clear that my wife was a remarkable "woman of business," and would yet be a model for all wise wives and perfect housekeepers. I felt convinced that, as the head of a household, she would yet achieve greatness.   CHAPTER III. ORDER IS HEAVEN S FIRST LAW. "WOMEN," said Mrs. Gill carelessly, "have many defects-"  "Except one," I endeavored to reply; but no notice was taken of my attempted compliment, as the lady's mind was manifestly engrossed in  serious questions.  -of education,"' she added, completing her sentence. "It is time that we had. reformers like Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony and all the rest of them. There is need of improvement in our sex, and I don't wonder that men scold their wives just as you scolded me when I was swindled by that wretch Davis. I couldn't be expected to know the price of all sorts of groceries; how could I? I was never told, and there are Bo many of them. If manlive by bread alone, it would be one thing; but he\ don't.

Although accustomed by this time to Mrs. Gill's forcible manner of expression, this picture of my delinquencies was so appalling, that I made a feeble endeavor to defend myself, and a vague attempt at caressing propitiation. "There I don't interrupt me, if you please," was the only response I met. ' I 'was speaking of something of importance. What was it?--oh, I remember: the reforms I was about to begin.

I muttered something about angels" footsteps that do not even crush the flowers; and though the cocking up of one rosy ear assured me that my delicate insinuation was not thrown ,away, it did not stop the deluge of reform which was just then overwhelming my pretty wife. "I was always set down as most disorderly at school, but I am going to change. Miss Anthony says women can do anything they choose, and- I choose to be a methodical model.

And as for your spectacles,-why, you ought to have them tied to your nose." She broke into satirical and derisive laughter at this juncture. "You always take them off to read, and lose them as often as you do so,. and go groping round like a blind man without his dog, and I have to find them; I do think, Mr. Gill, you might have some regular place to put your spectacles, and not make such a ridiculous figuree of yourself, groping about and upsetting my mantel ornaments and. swearing to yourself, though you think I do not hear you, and looking so absurd." I thought it was time to make a diversion here, and recalled her attention to the charge of her being disorderly at school, which I stouitly in- sisted I could not possibly believe. "But it is true, nevertheless," she answered. "It is one of those stubborn facts which the wa- ters of oblivion will never wash out. I do not mean to say it was deserved. I suppose I was only misunderstood. You know that women who do wrong are always only misunderstood, but all my life have I been brow-beaten, scolded, slapped, pinched, reproached, stormed at, and generally maltreated for my utter want of order."   ORDER IS HEA VEN'S FIRST LAW.    65 M3y blood warmed with indignation at the idea of such abuse of my darling wife, but the conso- lation came to me that there was much in her for- cible way of putting things, and that probably she did not quite mean all she said. "My  untidiness was a by-word, and bitter tears, grievous humiliation, and solitary confine- ment too often my portion. They had an unu- sual custom in my school. Every Monday morn- ing a girl was appointed as 'Diligence' for the week, and it was her duty, when the other scholars trooped out to play, or were huddled off to pray- ers, or went to meals or bed, to swoop down upon every stray book, ribbon, handkerchief, pen, pen- cil, pattern, glove, piece of india-rubber, trinket, work-box, or knitting-needle she could find in the deserted school-room, and carry them off to a little dark closet called the' Auction Room.' "On Saturday night, after all the studies and  exercises were over, the Principal, Mother Grab, as we used to call her, took her seat at the highest desk, or rostrum, flanked, by all the other teachers, and with us girls, trembling in our rows of seats before her and proceeded to dispose of the articles which had accumulated and which were placed in a  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7667-00000033"/> 8 HEA VEN'S FIRST LAW.

Selecting the largest, a work-box or something of that sort, she would say, 'Here is a work-box, a very handsome work-box: rosewood and silver; a pretty thing; the present, perhaps, of some loving mother, a kind, indulgent father, or a generous brother, to some little girl who values it so little as to leave it lying around the school- room in utter carelessness. Who bids for this property ' At that awful question there would be a snuffling sob from Desk No. 22, which would draw all eyes in that direction; and then No. 22 would have to get up and crawl-down the long aisle, amid the grinning girls who had lost nothing this week, but whose turn was sure to come next week, and gasp out hysterically: ' I bid for it,' and stand there while a sentence or two of repri- mand was delivered, and until the question 'Which is Heaven's first 'law?' was answered, and the property was restored, usually with the kind ex- pression, 'We shall do better next time, won't we '--I was 2Vo. 22." At that moment she pretended to hide her blushing face on my shoulder, and I had to comfort her for the unjust abuse which had been heaped upon her head in her younger days. Under that   ORDER IS 1 EA VEX'S FIRST LAW.   67   treatment she recovered herself surprisingly soon, sooner than I desired: the sufferings of her youth- ful days not seeming to have made a lasting im- pression on her mind, and proceeded: "But I was telling you about my projected re- forms. I am going to open a set of books. Men have books in their business, and I don't see why women should not have books in their business. I suppose you will laugh, but house-keeping is as much a business as any other. I am going to have my day-books and ledgers and journals and petty cash. Petty cash: that is business, French, I suppose, for petit cash, only merchants are not expected to know how to spell,-they are too grand for that,-and little cash would be too suggestive of the ordinary condition of most of their finances to be agreeable. In my ledger I shall put down all the money you give me; the entries will be small indeed." "But my dear," I protested. I was, however, not tallowed to proceed. "Never mind," she responded promptly.

And my journal, that shall be my own, for private circulation only; here," and she drew my head towards her, and approached her lips to my ear-"I will whisper. It shall contain the items of my dress-account! No mortal eye shall ever gaze on them; at least, no male mortals two eyes. One eye would not be so bad, for I sup- pose one eye could only see half as much as two. There! will I not be a masterly model of me- thodical management?

Although I have read their book all through, and do not see what use   it is, unless a person follows Mr. Greeley's advice to 'Go west young woman,' and finds herself un- expectedly in a log-hut, with no conveniences ex- cept what 'her men folks' can ' knock up' out of rough boards and old boxes. I hope I shall never be exiled to the wilderness; but if I do, I think I shalt be able to purchase at least a little furniture without having it 'knocked up' for me as Mrs. Stowe and Miss Beecher recommend fod-ofas and ottomans and screens, and even bedsteads. Their mlnen folks' must be more accustomed to ' knocking up' things than mine. My 'man folk' only knocks things down, when groping around after his artificial eyesight; and as for 'knocking up' boxes, it is much easier to send to your grocer and buy them for twenty-five cents apiece. My book may not have as fine pictures, but you shall see whether it will not be more practical. At least, I shall never recom- mend anybody to have a dirty bag hung up against a clean wall, to put dirty shoes in. How would our room look if you had your boots, cov- ered with mud and filth, poked half in and half out of pockets in a big, hanging against our nice new wall-paper?

What I tell you is to keep them in the. closet out of sight, or else have a boot-blacking stand: an ornamental one. By the way, I must make a memorandum to buy you one of those, and then perhaps, Mr. Gill, you will at last conform to something like order and neatness." Sure enough Mrs. Gill proceeded to carry her words into effect. She chained down her natural erratic brilliancy to the 1household carryall, like Pegasus to the dung-cart. She put her vagaries in the stocks, and set her imagination, on the treadmill of the domestic dog-churn. She estab- lished pla'ces for every personal possession and house-keeping article, spending no little time in their due arrangement and rearrangement. Reg- ular hours were set for work, meals, and amuse- ment. Methods of service were determined in more firm and unchangeable than the laws of the Aledes and Persians. There were certain inconveniences in this strict rule and inflexible system; sometimnes meals came when I was most occupied and least willing to be disturbed; cleaning and sweepingr and dusting drove me from pillar to post; our *    .   *   ORDER IS HEAVEN'S FIRST LAW.    71 amusements were sadly interfered with by the impending sense of short hours and approaching labor. But, as she daily explained to me, much time was saved, and that in housekeeping as in all other sort of business, " time was money." I knew she was right. She had precept and precedent on her side. A certain and invaria- ble moment for waking, a regular hour for break- fast, a fixed period for study or work, so much exercise in the open air, such a length of sleep,- these were what all reformers n all ages had proved were the first requisite forJman's improvement. By unanswerable argument it had been demon-  strated, over and over again, that in no other way could a perfect household be maintained, and so I knew that any restiveness or inconvenience I mig ht experience was wholly unjustifiable. If I should happen to be called upon-t6 break off at some busy point of work in order to amuse -my- self, or at the highest moment of pleasure in or- der to set to work, I made up my mind that it was the true course of wisdom and due obedience to reform. True to her promise, one of her first acts was to open a set of books showing all her expendi-  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7667-00000036"/> 72  ORDER IS HEA VEN"X S FIRST LA W. tures of every kind whatsoever down to the mi- nutest. "Six cents for a loaf of bread and five cents car-fare " even were not olnitted. These books were distinguished by appropriate head- ings. There was one for current expenses of liv- ing, the daily out-go pertaining to the house. Whatever was paid to the butcher, baker, and candlestick-maker-the latter being the poetical way of referring to the gas company which monthly sent round its customary swindling bill for light that was no light but only incipient am- eurosis and cataract. The pass-book surrepti- tiously obtained from the corrupt and deceitful Davis was originally appropriated to this purpose. Across the first few pages, where the entries of her unfortunate purchases at his store were re- corded, was written, in the largest style of hand and reddest of red ink, the decisive words,." Paid in full, and account closed." One distinguishing peculiarity .of all Mrs. Gill's account-books was a running fire of com- mentary, explanation, and accompaniment, some- times germane to the text, sometimes entirely disconnected and probably suggested by out- side events. These addenda were often written   ORDER IS HEAVEN'S FIRST LAW.    73 directly in with the items of expenditure, but were also used to fill up blank spaces, and occasionally occupied entire pages to them- selves. They were explanatory, didactic, senti- mental, in the nature of diary, or totally discon- nected and incidental.  They broke   in  at unexpected moments and on diverse occasions. As a specimen of them, I will give the opening words of her general -account, between it and the close of Mr. Davis's overcharges. They read as follows: "Wednesday, June 1st, 18-. "Don't owe anybody a red cent. "Economy is the seed of wealtlh "Looks easy enough when written, but is prac- tically a hard road to travel." Then follows systematically the list of charges in due order: "3Bread, six cents; milkl five cents; eggs, twenty cents; berries, fifty cents," through page after page of closely written matter. Some of the entries were peculiar; for instance, ice was never charged as an item, but seemed to be as- sociated with the man who brought it,- and was invariably entered as " iceman "; and so news- 4  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7667-00000037"/> 74  ORDER IS' HEA VEN'S FIRST LAW. papers were converted into " newsman I '; but nevertheless every outgo, even to the smallest, was duly and religiously recorded. Here and there would be found a commentary, or a valuable striking note, a reflection on the character of sone dealer who had been detected in improper practices, or else general deductions drawn from the experiences connected with the transactions recorded in the book. For instance, on a certain page was copied the Bible apothegm, "All men are liars," with the application--" at least all grocery men are, for the berries whllich I bought as fresh, just recleived from the country that very morning, had a few good ones sprinkled over the surface, while beneath all was festerin, corruption." The first entry under the heading of Augulst 1st was the doubtless at the time impressive fact:. "Tlhernmometer eiglty in the shade ; and shortly beyond it appeared a souvenir of one of my unhappy blunders. It happened in this wise: One day v when I Mrs. Gill was deeply imlnersed in the occupation of settlingc up her accounlts,-- an affair of no small intrica'cy, and which was coI1n- sidered sufficiently important to override any   ORDER IS HEA VEN'S FIRST LAW.    75 other engagement, I grew a little impatient. I would gladly forget the occasion if I could; but my mistakes towards Mrs. Gill are inva,-- 1, . so impressed upon my memory that they are not easily forgotten. I was hungry for my dinner! That acknowledgment strips the case of the sem- blance of poetl:y and romance; but after all, human beings have stomachs as well as hearts, and stom- achs are just as imperious in their own depart- ment. The bell for dinner had rung, and no notice was taken of the announcement; for although Mrs. Gill's rules are inflexible as to others, she, as the source of all authority, can disregard them herself. I mildly and meekly referred -to the fact that dinner was ready, but elicited no re- sponse, so deeply was she engrossed in her house- keeper's book.  Again I expressed the yearning of my appetite, to be only again treated with in- difference.  Then the lord of the human Inem- bers rebelled, and for a moment assumed author- ity over caution, affection, timidity, prudence, wisdom, and all the other qualities which go to make up a  good husband. The stomach com- manded the intellect to form ideas, and the tongue  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7667-00000038"/> 76  ORDER 1S HEAVEN'S FIRST LAW. to utter words which were inappropriate and dan- gerous. Under this influence I said testily: ( Oh, do leave that stupid account-book till an- other day. I should think you could find some -better time for it." NTo sooner were the words given to the " neigh- bor air," than I regretted them. But, was gesagt ist, ist gesaygt; there was no possibility of recall- ing them. The result was that my dinner was not satisfactory that day, and the following entry ap- peared in the book: "Items unknown ....... $50. One of the consequences of my mistake was that the running of the house fell to my sliare for some days after that event, and when at last I had sufficiently humbled myself and atoned to be forgiven, I could only recall generally how much I had spent, and was with shalne compelled to state it in an inaccurrate lump when required to give an account of my stewardship ad interim. And so it was entered, a standing record of man's folly and incapacity.

Tliat book of Davis's was after all but a small affair, and was soon filled full from opening sheet to the blank illside pagfe of the end cover, and then it was dismissed cllaracteristically. Across each page was drawn with the blaclest of black lead-pencils, double cross lines, from corner to corner of the sheet, to express in the strongest and completest manner, that that was ended and finished finally and forever. But to make this ,still more apparent, there was written in large bold letters of red ink across the leather binding, the expressive words: '"This bookl is played owet " At the end was this self-laudatory deduction: "End of Vol. I.

All itemized, and each with the exact cost opposite it. What evidence was here of method and system! Who after reading it could deny that woman is as capa- ble of orderly work as man. From the day when Mrs. Gill had announced her resolution to begin a reformed system of housekeeping, she had never faltered, but to the last had duly recorded every expenditure, great or small. I had always had a leaning towards female reform. Giving women their rights, seemed so simple a matter of justice, that it could not be denied. There might be some dispute as to what those rights were: whether the wife should take all her husband's property, and keep all her own or not; whether she should be authorized to in- cur 'unlimited liabilities on his account, while re- fusing to pay a dollar of his debts, or whether. either should dispose of the other's possessions as he or she pleased. About these questions there might be some dispute; but that a woman should be allowed to be orderly, that a wife should be permitted to know how she spends her husbadl's money, was an inherent right, of which I, as as married man, would be the last to allow her to   OR-DER IS HEA VE-"S FIR;ST LA W.  85 be deprived. That a-woman might even occa- pionally earn a  little money in a respectable way I was equally willing to admit, and I was thor- otglily determined to stand by any reform which should give woman some idea of the value of the goods she was daily purchasing. This book l proved what woman could do, bIut it went fur- thler: it contained many blank leaves, and the practical mind of Mrs. Gill did not allow these to go to waste; most curiously-did she turn them to account and connect them with the matter of the residue. It so happened that the furniture-dealer from whom  she made her principal purcllases was a German, to which fact I somewlhat attribute the excellence and reasonableness of his work; Iis desperate and  not wholly successful struggles with the Engalish tongue suggested to the fertile intellect of my wife the advisability of her study- ing  German. He: and she had many long and instructive interviews together, for she had made it one of her fixed rules never to purchase an article the construction of which she had not supervised or did not understand from turret to foundation-stone. This required numerous ex-  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7667-00000043"/> 86  ORDER IS RHEAVEN'S FIRST LA W. planations, which were, as difficult to understand as they were to make. But as the earnest little man, with all the politeness of his foreign educa- tion, did his best to lnake the case plain, and in- variably addressed Mrs. Gill as "mein laydee," and, moreover, as his goods invariably turned out all that they were represented, my wife was graduallyv led to believe that a knowledge of the Teutonic tongue would be of vast use to lier. So she secured the services of a young foreign lady, cast upon these shores by fate, and left to her talents and spectacles to make her own way in the world, and immediately proceeded to store her memory with the numerous words of the graceful German tongue. In the course of this instruction, it became necessary for her to write the phrases and sentences she was acquiring ; and what so natural place for that purpose as the book where her purchases of Dutch furniture were duly recorded! So to those vacant, virgin pages, aching to be utilized, were theyconsigned.

Those Dutchmen are a funny people. Well, when we had finished up the butcher and bought all there was in his shop, we would drop in on the grocer, and after that we would go to the apothecary; there is one on the very cor- ner of our street, who calls himself ' Deutscher ApotBker, but I am almost afraid to buy medi- cine in a strange tongue : I may get strange med- icine.

I have quoted this in full, as an evidence of my wife's talent for anything she may undertake. Where is there a better plan, or indeed one half so sensible and natural? Your Ottos, Wrages Ollendorfs, Manescas, Ahns and Adlers might come to her for instruction. They have never, with all their wisdom, struck out a single idea so brilliant and effective; and the man who will take up and elaborate her system will revolutionize the teaching of languages. There was much nmore, and I was becoming anl enthusiastic admirer of the sex at large, and a complete convert to the possibilities of woman's advancement. But then I remembered that I liad one in a thousand, and altogether lovely, so we will leave this for a glance at her other books. There was her dress-account. I will not say any- thing about the extent of it, for it is no use hav- ing a precious gem unless we set it well, and I am doubly proud of my  beautiful wife when she is tricked out in her most becoming finery. It is  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7667-00000046"/> E92  ORDER IS HEA VEN'S FIRST LA W: an honor to me that she should look- her best, and we cannot have fine/feathelrs for our birlds without paying fine prices for them; so I shut my eyes resolutely to every extension, and only glanced over the pages to prove her methodical regularity and love of system. This volume begins with an index to our library, giving the name of every book in it, and a reference to its bookcase and shelf. Why suchl a list should come there is not quite apparent at first glance, but I suppose that is as good a place as any other. It must be somewhere, if it was to be made out at all, and the beginning of the dress- book was clearly more appropriate than tilhe middle, or than any part of either the current  expense, household, or miscellaneous book. Per- sons who would find fault with this had better look for something else to carp at. Indeed, I think no more appropriate place for a library in- dex could have been chosen, than the first pages of a dress-making account-book. The very seriousness of the one is a desirable contrast to the lightness of the other, and nothing would be more apt to keep down the extravagances of van- :   ORDER 18  EA VEN'S FIRST LA W.  93 ity than the colltemplation of works of literary merit. The very soberness of many of these, would inevitably sugest s obriety of apparel, and all right-thinking men must, on calm reflection, endorse my wife's arrangement as the most ad- mirable possible. At the close of this index came the serious portion of the accounts, but somehow this record got twisted round, for the first statement at the head of the account is as follows: "Dress and Personal Expenses continued from the end of this book." Here was a conundrum worse than the intro- duction of the book-list. WhVy  Mrs. Gill com- menced in the end instead of the beginning, I do not exactly know, but for some good reason no doubt. She is not apt to do a thing without a reason, and a    good one, and my  not knowing what it is- does not in the least argue that it does not exist. Perhaps it was on general principles, on the great underlying theory which sustains all refornls-that to correct any abuse you must be- gin at the bottom, and puzt that on tol) so as to en- tirely reverse the prevlious order of affairs. Thus  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7667-00000047"/> "  ORDER IS H1EA VEN'S FIRST LAW. was laid the commencement of all reforms in woman's position.  The attack was originally made on man's habiliments; the first breach was made in the breeches. When Mrs. Bloomer and her early proselytes discarded their accustomed garments, and seized on man's, she and they did not take his hat, nor at first even his coat, nor his vest. They were radicals; they recognized their position as of akin to tihat of the sans culottes of the French revolution, and they went for his pantaloons. Once in possession of these, and they knew that he was at their mercy.  Then they proceeded step by step to divest him of hs vest, coat, and hat, till they had the freedom of his personal habiliments. Then, and not till thcel, did they demand his other privileges and posses- sion. Next they divided his vantage of study and brain. Thus armed and equipped, they nmade breaches in the walls of his colleges, his associa- tions, hs clubs; they stood beside him in the workshop and mill; they grasped the pen from hs hand, and tore the scalpel from his grasp. Theyll voted themselves D D's. and L L.D's., and more appropriately still, in view of their beginnings A S.S.

To-day they pre- sent us their perfect work of equipment, dress courage, knowledge, and professional standing in Mrs. Dr. Mary Walker. Surely a system which produces such a iesult is not to be condemned hastily. Possibly this was Mrs. Gill's instinctive idea. She knew that in keeping a set of household books ;le had done what no woman had ever done be- 'ore; that she had made a tremeindous inroad into one of man's pet prerogatives-the accountinog or what he did with his money. Such an inno- ation on the established plractice of man's getting 'ith care, and woman's spending with compla- ancy, was appalling, and the only wav to begin     i she may have thought, was to commence at the id.  At least the arrangement lent variety to e wolrk, a variety which was not dispelled by its     ntents.

Ticket for charity soiree." And then followed the deduction from these outlays: "I'd just like to know who is going to pay me back all these things. Just see all the mliscella- neous trash I've been getting, and then call me extravagant in my dress if you dare!

You have often undone them yourself, and seen the absurd contrast which generally exists between  the pur- chase and its envelope.

But I -was telling you about my dress-mak- ing materials, and how I put them safely and carefully away in rows upon rows of boxes, the results of my innumerable purchases at {acyI's store. Of course I could never find them again unless I were to label them, so I wrote their names on cards, to be fastened to each box. My dress-maker at that time was a Frenclh girl, who understood so little English that she could never make them out in our language, and as she had to use them more than I did, I put the names all in French. I got these whenever I did not know theml by showing her the article and inquiring what she called it. Then she would tell me, and I would write it down, though I know she did not speak good grammar, and I anm convinced hler pronunciation[ was not what it should be, and she may have given me the wrong names some- times.

"At least everything is there," she answered, pouting a little. "Yes," I replied, " and most capitally svstem- atized, so that every charge is entered under its appropriate head." "I dare say some people could buy cheaper," she went on, not altogether satisfied; "but it is not in my nature to haggle and dicker and beat salesmen down.

We all have to be cheated sometimes, and few people get off as well as you have. One thing is certain: nobody ever cheats you twice." Without noticing imy compliments,--which is quite a way she has, although she hears them well enough in spite of her pretended indifference,- she assumed a puzzled air, and closing the book, laid it in her lap, and, crossing her hands, said: "One thing depresses me.

Of course I made no effort to discover her secret, in order that she might have time to bring it to full fruition before she gave me the benefit of it. In fact, I was by this time prepared for almost anything, from her studious and inquiring nature, for I already felt a premonition that she was des- tined to be a great reformer, and if she had sud- denly commenced addressing me fluently in Greek, the result of a secret study of a month or so, I should not have been surprised, but would only have set to work to furbish up my old enemy, tupto, that I might respond in a similar tongue. Or, if she had proceeded to give me a lecture on the solar system,-the precession of the equinox, or the transit of Venus,-I should simply  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7667-00000055"/> "O      OUR SECOND. have tried to listen with intelligent interest, and gain as much as possible in the way .of inlfor- mation. So I said nothing, and assumed an air of obliviousness, waiting for further develop- ments. These did not take long to come. ' Mrs. Gill not only fills up quickly with a subject, but overflows as quickly as she fills. "Husband," she said to me, "I have bought a sitz-bath. I am afraid it is not deep enough, but how could I tell? I did not like to sit down in it, and try it before all the clerks in Bassforl's store. That would hardly have been respectable; and the man assured me it was the largest size made, and agreed, if we did not like it on trial, to take it back and make me a larger one. I am very much afraid it is too small." While she pondered over this oppressive doubt, I took occasion to remark: "I think you can rely on Mr. Bassford's doing every thing he agrees ; but what do we want with a sitz-bath?" "What! It is the best hygienic and curative agent," she replied oracularly, "in the world. Nothing is so strengthening to the back, or -brac- ing to the muscles. It gives tone to the whole -   OUR SECOND. system, and even refreshes and invigorates the blrain. You know lhow weary a person feels soanetimes; what a dreadful sense of lassitude comes over one; such a tired sensation, witJlout any special reason, or with reason, after over- exrction, shopping, or anything of that sort. Well, a sitz-bath will make a complete revolu- tion, and produce vigor, elasticity, and good spilits. An ordinar3 bath is good, too. I do not deuy that, but in the first place, one can not al- t a ys take a fllI plunlge-bath; it is a bothe ; and requires so ml" eh Nvater, and such preparation. And   when one is feeble, it causes too geat. a shocl, and  a slock is extremely danerous if the systemn is lrun down and the vitality diiinished. A   person may take a sitz-bath under any ircum- stances, with perfect safety; not too cold, of course. Nobody would sit shivering for half an hour, seated in ice-water; but at the proper tem- p)erature, there is certain to be a healtly reaction. Wlereas, it is almost perilohs for delicate persouls to take plunge-bathsa at all without the preserip tion of a  regular physician."

"Never, you goose!  How could I be, when the bath-tub has not come home yet; although Bassford promised to have it here to-day? But those shopkeepers are not reliable. You may say he will keep his word, as to taking back the tub if it does not suit, and making me another,-which is fortunate, for I am perfectly confident it is too small; but he certainly has not kept his word in sending it home when he agreed. But why did you think I had been bathing in it, when I ex- pressly said I did not know if it would suit? I would certainly know if I had tried it, but there is no place in Bassford's to try bathing-tubs. What an absurd idea!" She laughed heartily at my folly, and I must confess the idea of my modest and pretty wife taking a sitz-bath even with invisible soap and imperceptible water, in the presence of the assembled clerkls in Bassford's establishment, was more than ridiculous. "I have great faith in the good effects of water," she went on, as soon as she had recovered   O UR SECONLD.      13 l13 from the absurdity of my suggestion.

I should otherwise have obtained much llaluable informa- tion in the matter of pathology that had been gleaned by Mrs. Gill in the course of her late studies, or acquired by a species of iututive in- spiration, a gift in which she was very strong. This untimely arrival changed the current of the discourse and vindicated Mr. Bassford's reputa- tion for punctuality both at the same time. The tub was at once conveyed upstairs and placed in our room, where Mrs. Gill eyed it sus- piciously and with a severe air of doubt. "I am not satisfied," she said, " that that is the tub I selected. I was careful to choose one that had not a break anywhere in the paint. There is a scratch which may in time become a leak and so stain our carpet and perhaps rot the floor, if it does not run through and ruin the ceiling below, as happened with that impostor Jones, who, you will remember, left the house in such a vile con- dition when we hired it, besides defrauding us   OUR07  SECOND.     115 for pretended improvements. I hope the next house he ruins will be his own." I assured Mrs. Gill there was no danger of the tub's springing a leak at the spot she indicated, as tin was fully as impervious to water as paint. "But, my dear," I added meekly, " thereis one difficulty in the use of a sitz-bath which I should like to know your way of overcoming .IIow are we to fill it?" "' Really, husband," Mrs. Gill replied in a tone of remlonstrance, "I should not think you would care to worry me with trifling objections, when you can see I have more important matters to think of. The tub will be filled, I suppose, as tubs always are: a sitz-tub in this respect is in nowise different from any other tub." "I meant, my dear," I said, still more humbly, "that we cannot get a pail under the faucets of our, wash-basin, and that it wili be quite awkward bringing water froml the bath-room either early in the morning or late at night when one is in the scanty dress which precedes a bath." "I never thought of that," she replied, surprised; but recovering herself quickly added," however, that is a matter for you to arrange.

"That is not all," I continued, encouraged by the fact that my objection was considered of im- portance. "It is not only the filling, but the emptying, which must be thought of. That is a pretty roomy affair, and when full of water can- not be handled conveniently. If we try to carry it to the bath-room we shall be sure to spill more or less, and dipping out with buckets will be a dis- agreeable operation." "Husband, I wish you would not make such a mountain out of a mole-hill. Surely you are equal to filling a bath-tub with water!"  "Then there is the temperature. It will not be easy to make sure of the proper degree of heat. You are rather particular and difficult to satisfy."- At this point Mrs. Gill sat down in a chair and folded her hands, while her big eyes began to threaten a degree of heat sufficient to warm a tub of ice-water. Well,'" she said, ' if you are going to find so many objections I will send the bath-tub back again. It is true, I did feel the want of it, and   OUR S EOND. o.

In her book she mentions some surprising-- "I have it!" I burst in at this moment, my mind having dwelt upon the problem of fillingo the tub, and inconsiderately failed to follow he thread of my wife's remarks. She was not pleased at being cut short; she never is, and rarely fails to resent it. " How often must I tell you that it is extremely impolite to interrupt a person who is speaking ?" she asked severely. "You ought to have better manners. To break in on one so just when I was coming to the point of what I had to say, is ex- tremely disagreeable. That is, unless you do not wish to hear me,-unless you think what I say of no consequence." This was a construction I could in nowise per- mit, and I asseverated the; contrary strongly. She proceeded: " You have often told me there was nothing gave you greater pleasure than to hear me talk. I do not see any object you could have in telling an untruth, but I am sure I am willing to be silent, if you prefer it." I again disclaimed any such intention in the most positive language.

That is a lesson for you which I hope you will remember. The matter has slipped from my mind altogether, and just because you shouted out some silly interruption." "My dear," I explained.patiently, " I am very sorry, but I just then thought of a plan of filling the sitz-bath, which will answer perfectly." " I am glad I was not interrupted for nothing this time," Mrs. Gill remarked, with a slightly contemptuous tone in her voice. "What is your discovery ? " "You see that piece of India-rubber tubing," I explained, " the one we used on the gas for the drop-light? Whenever we wish to fill the tub we have only to slip one end on the faucet and put the other in the bath. Then by turning on the water, and by shifting it from the hot to the cold, we can regulate the temperature precisely," proceeding to put in operation my plans as I spoke. " Of course I knew there could be no difficulty about it; but remember one thing," Mrs. Gill said impressively when these experiments were con-  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7667-00000060"/> 120       O UR SECOvYD. eluded; "always wet your head before you sit down in the bath.

I experienced the benefit of the injunction, however, frequently, a4 after that day sitz-baths became a common event with me, Mrs. Gill being altogether too unselfish and toy fond of me lot to gi Ve me the full benefit of her- discovery.- In fact, the curative benefits were applied almost wholly to myself, although if there was any lassitude in my system, olr weakness in my body, I had yet to discover it; still, my wife was so earnest in desiring to protect me fromn possible ills, that I could not object. Taking a sitz-bath is not altogether a graceful performance, beneficial as it no doubt is. Many was the morning that, covered with a blanket which encompassed tub anld water and myself, all bult my head, I sat for full ten minutes by the clocl--the regulation time--ini anything but an elegant attitude in my dressing-room, whilo $   OURB SE0COND.      121 Mrs. Gill either finished her morning nap in the ad- joining apartment, or held forth to me on improv- ing subjects, in tones which were audible through the nearly closed door. She generally preferred her nap, and' seemned entirely convinced that she had done her whole duty so long as the bath was administered to me, although originally it seemed to have been purchased for herself. "Husbandl," she called out one morning when I was in this defenceless attitude, "I am afraid you take your bath too warm. You know that Mrs. Mason says that sixty is the most refresh- ing temperature." "My dear," I protested, alarmed iAt the pros- pect of being half frozen in the service of science, "I only arrange it so that it shall cause me no shock."' Fortunately remembering that sle had mentioned " shock" as one of the dangers specially to be avoided. "I merely take it at blood-heat," I added. At these words, I heard a movement in the next room as if Mrs. Gill were getting up suddenly. "Good heavens!" she said," do-you not know that the heat of the body is eighty and soine- -times ninety degrees?

And this after all my warnings, the pains I took to tell you of the importance of a proper regulation of the heat! There is but one thing to be done now: you must have a COLD POUR.5 "What, my dear?" 1 exclaimed, not at all liking the sound of the ominous words. " What is a cold pour ?." Yes," she exclaimed, not heeding me. "Yes, that is'it. A cold pour will remove the deleteri, ous effects at once, and restore the nerves to their normal tone. How do you feel ? she asked, her head appearing for a moment at the crack of the door, in her anxiety as to my condition. "Very well, I assure you," I replied jocularly. "I might say, much as usual, a mon ordinaire as we remark in French.' "This is no trifling matter, I can tell you," she answered, putting down my frivolity at once. You have a lassitude, have you not ? "Yes, my dear; warm water, you know--" "A  general relaxation of the system?" she asked again, interrupting me.   " Certainly, I have a sort of relaxation--5 "I knew it, I knew it! " she replied, with an anxiety about my condition which began to alarm me in spite of my assured indifference. "That is, it? I expected as much. Oh howcould you be so foolish! A cold pour is the only hope. IHow long have you been taking baths at this excessive temperature ?" "Why, my dear, you know I was afraid of shock," was my hesitating response. "I was un- easy lest there shoald be no reaction, and I really believe I have always had them at about this temperature." "And never told me. Get up at once and take a cold pour immediately," she commanded decis- ively. " Yes, my dear," I responded, preparing to obey, '"but you have not told me what a cold pour is." "'It is a pitcher of cold water poured down the small of your back while you are standing in the tub, and still warm from the excessive and unnat- ural heat of the bath." I had started to get up, but sat down again at these words, and drew the blanket closer around me; they sent a shiver through me. "Cold  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7667-00000062"/> OUR SECOND.  water down my back!"  The idea was enough to set my teeth chattering and my bones rattling. It went to their marrow like, ice. Comfortable warm baths were one thing, but cold ice-water on my spine was another. I determined to parley. "Really, I do not feel as if I needed so severe a remedy," I remonstrated, but Mrs. Gill was not to be softened. "You do, indeed," she answered; "who knows best, you or I? You must restore the tone of the system promptly. There is no time to be lost. Do it at once." "Indeed my system is doing very well, and it will be impossible-for me to pour water down my own back." "But you must, you must! It will strengthen the spine, drive the excess of blood from the cer- ebellum, restore the normal condition of the cir- cula4ion, and send the arterial fluid back to the vital centres which are suffering from its absence. Do not wait another moment !" "No, my dear," I replied, witlout moving, for I felt that there were advantages about my position which made me comparatively safe. "But I am sure you alarm yourself unnecessarily, I   OUR SECOND.   125   and I am afraid of slock from too sudden an ap- plication of cold water. Mrs. Mason, you will re- member "-quoting at random, never alsving seen the lady or her book-" says that sudden shock is extremely dangerous, and often instantly fatal." She answered, however, paying no heed to my imaginary quotation, "Don't I tell you there must be shock sufficient to produce reaction and correct the morbid condition of relaxation? Heavens! if I could come in and administer it myself!" There is no telling what Mrs. Gill will not do in the cause of science, or on behalf of her hus- band, and I began to fear she might carry out her threat, a prospect which I did not like to con- template, in view of the season of the year and the temperature of Croton water. Thoroughness is one of her peculiarities, and if she once did an- dertake to pour water down my spine, I quaked at the thought of how cold I should be before she got tlhrough. She performs whatever she under- takes with enthusiastic energy, and such a drench- ing was before me as I should mnot soon forget, unlless some diversion could be made. There was a certain amount of security in my situation, my  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7667-00000063"/> OUR SEYCOND.  very defencelessness being a protection, but there was no trusting to it, and some other resource must be had.    Fortunately the door was so nearly closed that it was impossible to see from one room  to the other, so that offered me a chance. Deceiving one's wife is wrong; it is also un- safe; but there are occasions when it is almost, if not quite, justifiable: impending "cold pours" in mid-winter are surely sucll justification. I pro- ceeded with a gross deception.    Taking a pitcher of water, I emptied the contents from a considerable height into the bath-tub, all the while making a shivering noise and chattering my teeth as though the torture were being duly administered according to directions. I kept my ears closely on Mrs. Gill's move- ments, which I could make out dimly through the intervening obstacle.  She seemed to be dressing hastily; then there was a rattling of books and turning over of pages in manifest haste. She was consulting authorities-my criti- cal condition was being subjected to analysis-so I poured the more energetically and chattered the louder. In the midst of this operation she   seemed to have found what she wanted, for she became silent for a moment. "Stop!" she cried out hastily.   "That is wrong; a cold pour is not the proper remedy, after all. You are not of a sanguineo-nervous temperament, but of a bilio-lymphatic. A hot foment is the proper application. Mrs. Mason directs that it shall be applied to the back of the neck. Dress yourself at once and come out here; I will have the cloths ready." A "hot foment" had a more grateful sound than a "cold pour."  There was something rather pleasantly suggestive about it, for my operations were causing a shivering in fact as well as fic- tion: as I had not time to dry myself, I was still dripping with warm water, which cooled on my exposed body. A nice "hot foment," ap- plied with the magnetizing little hands of my smooth-skinned wife, was not a bad idea. Still, before yielding myself to it, I thought it safest to make an inquiry or two. These scientific remedies arA not always to be trusted on the sound. Not a few of the softest-named drugs are the most objectionable to the palate. Bella- donna has little suggestion of its deadly charac-  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7667-00000064"/> 128      OUR SECOND. ter; senna is merely suggestive of a warm colored paint; mercury recalls the god from whom it is not derived; and even enema has a sweet, ladylike sound. So I inquired in an in- different way: "And what may a hot ferment be? Is it- some- thing warm to drink? That would suit me to a dot after all the cold water I have been slushing my back with." I was keeping up the fiction of the cold pour,- little knowing, in my blindness, what I was doing. "Of course it is nothing of the kind," Mrs. Gill replied promptly and decisively; " stimulat- ing drinks are expressly forbidden in all true systems of hygiene. I have told you this often enough- already, when I have seen you ruining your stomach with vile liquors." "Then my love, what is a hot foment2"  I reiterated. There has always been in my mind a sort of anology between foment and ferment; that idea probably suggested the possibility of its being something fermented, and thab led my thoughts by direct association to a liot drink, such as a hot Scotch, or a little mountain dew, or a cup of sack well brewed, or perhaps-   OtUr SECOND.       129 But my garrulous fancies were suddenly cut short. "A hot foment is the application of flannel cloths saturated with boiling water to some part of the body. It is a powerful counter-irritant. In your case, Mrs. Mason says the back of -the neck is the proper place for the application, to drive the blood from the spinal column and the gang- lion of nervous tissue."- 'But," I exclaimed, rather startled at this proposition, "if the water is boiling it may burn the skin!" "That is precisely what it is for; and if it pro- duces a blister, so much the better; counter-irri- tants in such cases are extremely beneficial, and the stronger, the better." "But my darling," I protested, by no means pleased with this style of producing a reac- tion, " you will burn your hands, and I could not allow-"' "Not at all!" she answered promptly.  "I shall stir the cloths with a stick and lift them out of the boiling water with a dry towel, so that they shall not lose their heat, while, I protect my hands too.

It is not necessary for me to follow this inci- dent further. It is only a specimen of numer- ous experiences which I endured for the sake of my health and the restoration of my constituiti Fon, although I never could discover what was the matter with me. I seemed, however, to be in a, condition of momentarily impending dissolution, requiring all the resources of art to save me. There was nothing in my strength or appetite or feelings to indicate this precarious state. I felt as well as ever, but my darling wife, with her mind excited by the medical works she had been pe- rusing, was alarmed for my safety, and I could not disappoint her by refusing to try any of the applications, external or internal, which would allay the worry of her mind even if they were not needed to restore the vigor of my body. Nor were these remedies confined entirely to cold pours, hot foments, and sitz-baths, but the entire repertory of water-cure, its system of fari- nacious food and restricted condiments and pecu- liar diet, was exhausted in my behalf. The moment I got up in the morning I was compelled   O UR SECOND    .   13 to drink a full tumbler of cold water. This was quite a shock at first to my stomach, which was not accustomed to much of that liquid at any time. At breakfast I had what were called "gems," which were well named/ for they cer- tainly vied in hardness with some of the pre- cious stones, or mush of some sort which con- sisted of lumps of dough floating in 'thick flour soup. At dinner, a meal that was also preceded with a full tumbler of -water, I was limited in the matter of meat, but given unre- stricted liberty with Graham bread, beets, raw cabbie, undressed salad, and such  digestible articles; while all manner of, wines, ales, and beers were strictly prohibited. ' I have not the slightest doubt that this is a most excellent course of treatment in case of weakness or ill health; Mrs. Gill could never otherwise have given it her approval. The only question in my -mind being, whether it was neces- sary for one who had never known an hour's sickness since childhood, and who might be not inaptly described as strong as a horse. Still, as Mrs. Gill had set her heart on it, and seemed to take much satisfaction in it, I followed her injunc-  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7667-00000066"/> 132      O OUR SEC OND. tions sacredly, only modifying their influence a little at my down-town lunch, and idemnify- ing my stomach by swallowing sufficient strong liquid to qualify the amount of water which I took both internally and externally at other times. "Husband, I have some news that will please you," said my charming wife one day. "You know what wretched Graham flour- our grocer sells us; how it makes our ' gems' leathery, and our mush lumpy, and our bread sticky." "Yes, my dear," I responded heartily; "I have long thought it vile stuff. I am glad that you agree with me. I should have proposed dis- pensing with it long ago and substituting some- thing fit to eat." t"Then you will be the more pleased to hear that I have done so." "Indeed I am," I responded. "It was the most tasteless, insipid, disagreeable stuff, and I only ate it to please you. I am heartily glad you are going to be done with it; my stomach re- joices at the news."

"I -lad written to AiMrs. ,Mason," whispered my wife, with a blush of pride and self-approval, "and she answered me. I am sure she is a good woman. I told her all about how I was pleased with her book, and that we were follow- ing her directions, and that we ate 'gems,' mush, and Grahaml bread. But I exp'lained to her, that either throughl the fault of our cook, or the quality of the material, our cooking was not a success. I said that I did not think dough, in its natural state, could be good for the human stomach, and that lumpy mush was about the most abominable concoction I had ever forced down my throat.

Hence it is that good Graham flour is such an infallible specific in cases of torpidity of diges- tion. I spent two hours with Mr. Stone and he urged me strongly to comle and board with him ; the interview was very satisfactory, except that he only sold the flour by the barrel, and it did seem to me it will take us a long time to use up an entire barrel, as neither of our girls will ever touch Graham flou; in any shape, in spite of my explaining to them, over and over again, what an advantage it would be. But ignorant people in- variably think there is some wonderful quality in white bread. I must devise some plan to make them eat Graham; my duty requires it; and now that we have an entire barrel, it is more necessary than ever." My wife paused; she seemed to be thinking how to persuade the- servants into appreciating the attractions of Graham flour; then she got up and went to the window, looking out, her slim and graceful figure outlined in all its exquisite proportions against the light beyond. I gazed at   O UR SECOND.       135 her, fondly admiring the thoughtless beauty of her attitude, and wondering what new ideas were at work in her busy brain. She stood there silently looking out, and when at last she turned, her face was rosy and her cheeks were blushing deeper than their natural tint. She came straight towards me, and putting her arms around my neck hid her shapely head upon my shoulder, around which, like a black cloud, streamed her ablundant hair. "iHusband, I have a request to make of you," she whispered. "Yes, dear," I answered, stealing a little hand to press to my lips. "I want you -to let me go to Binghamton this time; I was so ill before." And thus it was that she was to have her turn at the water-cure; I had had my share. Possi- bly-I exhibited the good effects, or else the logic of the hydropaths-was conclusive. My darling engaged her rooms at once at Mrs. Mason's es- tablishment.         q Some days after this, I came upon my wife, so deeply engaged looking at a photograph which she held in her hand, that she did not lear me.  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7667-00000068"/> 136       OUR SECOND. She was completely engrossed, her mind and senses wrapt in the contemplation of the picture, to the exclusion of all other sounds, sights, and thoughts. "My dear, what are you studying so intently?  I inquired. She started, and, turning, revealed a photo- graph of Mrs. Scott-Siddons, that artistic picture of this most attractive and ladylike of actresses, which exhibits her looking upwards, showing her classic features and exquisite profile to the best possible advantage. "Look at that nose!"Mrs. Gill replied enthu- siastically, more in natural outhurst than in re- ply to my question. "How straight! how per- fect! how admirably cut! It is a pattern of a nose! Noses are the weak points of human coun- tenances. Most people have straight eyes, but; not more than half have strailght noses. Good lips are abundant; plump cheeks are the dower of every peasant; perfect teeth can be bought at so much a piece; -but the perfect nose and nos- trils are rare. There are all sorts and varieties except the desirable ones in the nasal" protub- erance. There is the snub, which is very common,   oR SEOCOND.        37 and common as common; the pear-shaped, which has a droop not at all attractive; the turn-up, the fat, the thin, the long, the short; noses that express insignificance, or stupidity, or conceit; noses which are wholly disproportioned to the body which carries them: a ]luge proboscis hang- ing on the head of some dwarf, while Colossus carries a button hardly visible in his expanse of face. But here is a nose among a million; a gem of a nose; a beau ideal of nasal masterpieces; the subject for a painter's brush or poet's pen." "Yes," said I, wondering whither this nose would lead us. "But what on earth have you or I to do or say to that nose? What is that nose to us, though it does possess all the perfectiolns youl are hanging upon it? How does it come to be poked into our affairs?" "I was studying it." "Why? Do you intend to turn artist, and begin by painting -noses?"I inquired laughingly. "No," she replied slowly; and then, to divert my inquisitiveness: A"You remember the remark as to woman--'-ler eye must be fed'? I am feeding  my  eye-feeding it on Mrs. Siddons' pretty nose.

There was a man who invented a patent nose-shaper. It was only necessary to hang a compressor of a certain form on the end of your nose for a year or two, day and night, without ever taking it off, to have your' organ of smell come out of the most finished- Grecian mould. The machine had a defect in application-only one, but it was serious: you must not catch cold. You could get used to sleeping in the nose-im- prover, but a cold in the head was fatalj, the handkerchief was its remorseless enemy. That possibility deterred me, or I should have tried it; not on myself-on Dick. Hs nose wants regu- lating; elongation would be of vast benefit to itr and a weight properly suspended ought to pro- duce that result. But Dick has a chronic cold, and I was forced to desist." "But really, my dear, I cannot see the connec- tion between Dick's nose and Mrs. Siddons' pic- ture." "No? Well, the association is not apparent- not just now, whatever time may do for Dick; and Time will have to do his best if hle wants to win. It is a hundred to nothing, as you men   OUR SECOND.       139 say, against him as it stands. Dick's nose may have unrevealed .possibilities, but its revealed condition is a long way behind that of Mrs. Sid- dons', with little hopes of ever catching up." "I must confess I do- not exactly understand what you mean," I replied to this wild outhurst. "Truly? Well, I am surprised. Nor why I am studying German? nor why I am buying all the pretty things I see, that I may be accustomed to the beautiful, and my mind associated with perfection of color and shape? Then I must tell you. I must inform you of some of Nature's wonderful physiological truths, which few of you men ever consider when we women express a desire for a new dress, or a becoming bonnet, or a filne shawl. We are called extravagant, because men are ignorant brutes. This taste, this longing, this desire, is only a natural inter- nal impulse, which is implanted in our hea ts in order that our attention may be attracted to whatever is pretty and gay and pleasant, and the race of human beings not be given up to the coarse and rougll and commonplace of man's nature."'

"You notice Dick's uncertain temper? To what is that attributable but to that scoundrel Davis, who infuriated me when I first went to housekeeping by swindling me so in his charges for groceries. He put me in a rage, and kept me in a rage for months. I was never out of a rage till I saw him properly and deservedly pun- ished. And now, whenever I hear Dick scream or see him kick, and find him furious at having his face washed or his hair combed, I trace thle trouble directly back to Davis. If Dick should commit any crime in after-lifi, I would swear it was due entirely to Davis, and he alone was guiltyand ought to be punished.9" "My darling," I remonstrated, "your ideas would upset all our notions of jurisprudence, and make the punishment of crilinals an impossibil- ity." "And why should they be plunished when they are not guilty?." she asked. '"is Dick guilty because Davis was a cheat? Is my son to be punished because a swindling grocer imposed upon his mother?

"My dear wife, what has all this to do with Mrs. Siddons' nose a" "Everything," she answered, flaring up; then she stopped, paused, hesitated, and dropped out word by word in a little, half-audible voice: "If  -it - should-be -a--girl,-I-want-it-to- lave-j ust-suchl-a--nose." With that she threw down the picture, and, -coloring scarlet, went out of the door singing a familiar air with the weakest attempt at indiffer- ence possible to conceive. So it was settled that we were to go to Bflg- hamton.

I say "we" went to Binghamton to try the effect of water-cure; but that is too comprehen- sive. She went; I did not need the treatment, and only rattled out there occasionally to endure a few days homceopathic board and hydropathic lodging. I had had my water-cure at home, and enough of it to restore any latent defects that there might be hidden unperceived in my consti- tution. But Mrs. Gill was ascertaining by per- sonal experience the advantages she had so long preached to me, of " hot foments,'" "cold pc;urs," "douches," ' sitz-baths," and all such remedial agencies. Time wore on, and it seemed to me that she was becoming satiated with her experi- ment, for at my visits she spoke with waning en- thusiasm of the fare and the treatrent. There appeared to be less benefit than she had expeet; but still she stood it out manfully. "E Husband," she said on one of these occa- sions, when, slipping away from the lunhygienic surroundings of Saratogaj I was passing a few days in her company, "I am not entirely satis- fied with the way in which this establishment is   O1UR SECOND.       143 carried on.

It is neces-' sary for us to keep our appetites in check, and not have them tempted by injurious dainties. I am well aware of the advantages of moderate living and vegetable diet; still, I do think that only one dish of meat and one vegetable for din- ner is carrying the system  to extremes. Be- sides, good cooking has always seemed to me an essential for the ready assimilation of food; and beefsteak fried to chips, roast-beef cooked to leather, and veal left half raw are not pleasant to the palate nor good for the stomach. Salads are extremely beneficial; but when undressed, and not washed, full of bugs and sand, they are scarcely sufficient as the only vegetable.

She is lovely, but the doctor is a perfect miser." This was uttered with so much intensity, that my wife required somc minutes to recover her usual- composure, when she proceeded: No, it is he who hires a country girl as cook, and pays her in treatment; prescribes a sitz-bath for her daily, whenever she can get time to take it, or a cold pour at five in the morning, the very moment she wakes.

"My darling," I hastened to explain, "I mean no such thing, and insist upon it that you leave this place at once." She was mollified, and proceeded: "Tuesday we have soggy potatoes.

"Certainly I was," she answered aggressively; "but not a starvation-cure. You might have inquired, before you brought me here, the char- acter of the institution.

She resumed: "No, I am going to stay here to the end. In spite of squash and cabbage and beets, I am convinced that there is virtue in water-cure.

"Because if you did," she went on, not notice- ing my attempt at hilarity, "I have a little in the closet."  "You?"I exclaimed  with astonishment. "You?

"My dear, I have been to-day at a lecture by Dio Lewis. There is a great deal of reason in what he says. Our plan of diet is all wrong. When the world'was peopled with savages who lived by hunting, meat was the only food man could obtain; but now that knowledge and civil- ization have opened to us the vast store-house of Nature, it is almost the least nutritive as well as the dearest of foods. Certain constituent ele- ments are necessary to the'formation and-suste- nance of the human body: established proportions of albumen, nitrogen, caseine: and these are con- tained in the seeds or stalks of many plantsto a higher degree than they are in meat.

Potatoes nourish the Irish; lentils are a favor- ite of the French; the Germans prefer black bread to white; the Hindoos live on rice, and there is no reason why beans should not be the true American food." "Pork and beans, or plain baked beans, my dear? a? I inquired with an air of pleasantry. "Call them Yankee food, and let our scrawny New- England neighbors whose invention they are; have a monopoly of them. Then will I say bene est." U "This is not a subject for small jokes, Mr. Gill, for I suppose that is what you are trying to make. You know well enough how thin I amn, and how anxious to grow stouter, and yet you ridicule me when I am trying to find out the most nutritious food." My beautiful wife is as plump as a-seal, weighs a hundred and twenty pounds, and has not a bone visible in her neck or arms, while her ribs are . things to be taken wholly on faith. I protested that she was absolute perfection in the matter of flesh and bone, but she paid no heed, and pro- "eeded : "I do envy-that fat woman at Barnum's; how   A LITTLE BILL.      155 comfortable she always seems; so quiet and con- tented ; although in summer I would say she might be warm.

I become so an- gry with myself when I rememnber how I allowed that villain Davis and that cormorant Jones to put me out of temper and worry me. It sets me in a rage to think that those two scoundrels must have defrauded me of pounds upon pounds of flesh. I wish I had to deal with them again."

"But my darling," I exclaimed, alarmed at thls prospect, for Mrs. Gill is a woman of her word, and if aroused may go .all lengths, "I am afraid that would not be conducive to your grow- ing stout.) "Besides," shoe admitted resignedly, "I am not strong enough. I might mind the babies and cook, but never could wash the clothes or do the ironing. And then Dick would be sure to grab a bandful of live coals-he looks at them long- ingly whenever he comes into the kitchen now- or try to creep into the oven the first moment my'back was turned. I am afraid I must keep a nurse, but I will think it over." "But you were speaking about beans," I in- terjected, anxious for any excuse, to lead her mind to a less dangerous topic. '"Oh yes!" she said', happily diverted from the delinquencies of domestics. "Dio Lewis gave 1A*          A LITTLE BILL.      157 us an excellent lecture. I shall put his theory in practice at once, and have bought a scientific work lie recommended, which shows the exact analysis of every species of food with respect to its nutritive qualities. Beans stand first, and then come peas.  I like peas best, especially the canned French petitspois, and would have pre- ferred it had he recommended them; but so long as beans are the- most nutritious I shall stick to beans. I have often thought what a sin it was to waste so much money in eating. We pay our butcher two dollars, and our grocery man three, daily, to say nothing of fish and bread and fruit, and all that, whereas for ten cents we might have as much beans as our entire family could piossi- bly eat." "Yes, my dear," I uttered with an effort at sarcasm, " and a great deal more." She did not hear me, and proceeded earnestly. "Just look at it: five dollars a day,--and I am sure it is more than five, for you know, Mr. Gill, you are a little difficult to please with your meals.'? The truth is that my wife was herself somewhat of an epicure, and insisted upon having the table well supplied and the food well cooked, so that  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7667-00000079"/> 158-     A LITTLE BILL. her sudden conversion was the more remarkable.

Fifty times fifteen hun- dred. How much is that?"  ' Seventy-five thousand dollars,"- I replied. "Seventy-five thousand dollars, and interest ought to be added to it. Why, it is a fortune, and all thrown away, absolutely wasted. For what difference does it make to us what we ate for dinner ten years ago, or even a year, or for the matter of that, a week ago.? Particular as you are, I doubt if you can even now remember what we had for dinner this day last week. There! I thought as much. Not only is the taste gone, but the very recollection of the articles has faded away, and for all present advantage they might as well have been corned beef and cabbage as turkey and: truffles.

My wife has a skin like satin, without a dot or fleck on it; and tinted like strawherries and cream, so that I protested against the necessity of any remedial agent in such a connection. "I am not at all satisfied about that," she an- swered. "I think there is a freckle coming on my forehead; as for my nose. I expect a blotch to break out on it at any moment. My whole face has a painful tendency to flush. These are symlptoms which should not be neglected, for I am sure you would not like it if I were to break out all over and become spotty like one of Bar- num's leopards." In spite of my protests, the eloquence of M3r. Dio Lewis conquered, and the bean regimen com- menced next week. We had beans at all hours: our dinners opened withbean soup accompanied with bean bread; then we had pork and beans for- apiece de resistance, to be followed by bean cake as a dessert. There were other, intricate- dishes in, which beans were more concealed, but the flavor and prevailing constituent remained ;.  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7667-00000080"/> 160  -    A LITTLE BILL. the same. For breakfast we had beans warmed over, and for lunch cold beans. Beans are nutritious; there can be no question about that; they are likewise inexpensive, and may be wholesome, but there is a sameness about them which is quite objectionable. I have seen Dick in the third or fourth month of this treat- ment with a mouthful of baked beans which he was wholly unable to swallow, and what Dick cannot swallow must be difficult of deglutition. The dishes were neatly ornamented to give theln an air of foreign grace; baked beans came on the ta!ble like flaky pebbles piled in mimic mountains; they were surrounded with beet-roses, or carrot daffodils; they were treated with vine- gar, sauces, condiments, anything to give them an original flavor, but they remained pasty, sticky, mealy beans to the last. About this time I dined out a good deal. * Why will not some reformer some time select a palatable dish on which to found a theory? Why is there never any virtue in what is agreea- ble? Why must improvement and unpleasant- ness go together? Are we never to discover any excellence in what is gratifying?   A LITTLE BILL.      161 "My darling, wlhat on earth are you doing now? ' "I exclaimed, as I opened the parlor door suddenly on returning one day earlier than usual from business. There was Mrs. Gill in'. a light house-wrapper marching up and down the length of the room with gigantic strides and balancing a large volume of Moore's Melodies on her head. At the first glance I trembled for my wife's in- tellect, but one look at her eyes happily con- vinced me that I was in error. She was evi- dently sane ; without the least confusion or sur- prise, and in the most matter-of-fact way, she calmly took the book off her head, and, laying it on the piano, proceeded to give me an explana- tion. "I am practising, that is all. -Dio Lewis "--I groaned mentally at the name as I remembered all the beans I had swallowed--"Dio Lewis says that if ladies would acquire a stately and grace- ful walk, they ought to practice for a couple of hours each day, holding a heavy book on their heads. I thought a city directory the heaviest book I knew, but we have no city directory; and when I sent to the apothecary at the corner to bor- row his, he told me it was chained fast to the -coun-   &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7667-00000081"/> 162      A LITTLE BILL. ter. What a queer idea to chain a book fast; and yet I have half a mind to chain all my books fast: then my friends would not be forever borrowing, and forgetting to return them. It was only yes- terday that I went to look up my set of Dickens and put -it in order, when I found Nicholas Nickleby wanting. Then I remembered Mrs. Brown had borrowed it two months ago and never brought it back. I might have rings on the backs of all the volumes as they stand in'the shelves, and a chain running through them with a padlock on the end." "But, my dear," I said, "why not lock the bookcase?" ' Why, yes," she laughed; "how foolish I am; as if they would not borrow the key to the pad- lock just as they do that to the bookcase! But I was saying, as I could not get the directory, I imagined that- Moore's melodies would answer juist as well, though perhaps it is lighter reading." "Really, now,:' I protested, "your walk is graceful as a fawn's already, and I am afraid you will only spoil it. "Don't be absurd. Dio Lewis says you must aold in your chin ; not poke it out this way."   A LITTLE BILL.      163 She pushed her pretty round chin forward -in a most absurdly unnatural manner. "Press your chin down on your breast, keep your back straight, and walk with a firm, even step. By doing this, you can acquire ease and elegance, and I have been growing so fat lately, that I need to watch my motions, or- the first thing I know, I shall become as awkward as most of my fat friends." "And waddleaibout like a beautiful duck,'"I suggested jocosely. "Mr. Gill," responded Mrs. Gill, at once se- verely and repressively, "you need not use such vulgar expressions. If you intend to make ridic- ulous comparisons in reference to your own wife, I will leave the room. Waddle, indeed. You need hardly accuse me of that." "Why my darling, I did not accuse you of it," I explained humbly. "You said I waddled-like a duck." Giving mne no chance for denial, she proceeded: "I cannot help growing fat. You remember you always said you liked fat woimen." Again I struggled to protest, but in vain. "That is the sole reason I have been living on beans for the last six  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7667-00000082"/> 164      A LITTLE BLLL. months. No one would do that, except as a duty. And I have had myself weighed daily, to note the effect. I was only a hundred and tel when I began;-and now what do you think I weigh[ A hundred and thirty-two and a half!" She dropped back in her chair to look at me and see that I appreciated the full importance of this announcement, but laughing, quickly resumed the thread of her story. "My being weighed so often got to be quite a joke. Every day when I went to the grocery- store for our daily necessaries, I stepped on the scales and made the boy give me the exact weight. Sometimes he would try to shirk, pre- tending I could not have lost or gained in a 'ingle day, but I kept him up to it, and made him show me exactly how much it was truly and lonestly. Well, one day I forgot to order the ;ugar, and came back for that purpose, a few ninutes after leaving the store, and as soon as lie boy saw me, he ran to the scales, and asked ne if I had come to be weighed again. If he ad not been so large, I should have boxed his ars. Of course, a person must. grow daily, if ley are to grow at all; but -shop-keepers and    mechanics, and laboring men of all kinds, are so stupid. Only yesterday, I went into a shoemak- er's, to get a pair of boots made. The manll wanted to measure my fopt in the ordinary way; but I told him that Dio Lewis said we must stand on one foot with all our might, when being measured for a boot; so I made him bring a piece of paper, and I planted my stocking foot in the middle of it, and leaning on it all I could, without falling over,--which I nearly did,-told him to measure that. Well, would you believe it? ' lie couldn't do it: it was absurd; he said 'he was not going to ruin the reputation of his shop by making any such pair of Noah's arks.' He evidently showed from his manner that he thought I was crazy. How silly it was of him. ,Just as if it was not as easy to make a big pair of shoes as a small pair. Mechanics never have the least talent or originality; and although I  argued with him an hour, and showed him all the advantage of the plan, he only stared at me, a and grew more stupidly obstinate each minute. iI will have those boots somehow yet," she added, casting a reproachful look on the trim coverings which encased her tiny, gracefol feet; while I  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7667-00000083"/> 166      A LITTLE BILL. shuddered at the idea of the proposed sacri- lege. "Husband," said Mrs. Gill, a few days after this interview, " don't you think you have tried Dio Lewis's system of bean food about long enough  I do not wish to complain, but I am growing tired of one sort of diet, and should like a change. I am fatter than I was, I know, but after all, that may be due to the lager beer I have been drinking three tinmes a day, at lunch, dinner, and supper. Agassiz proves clearly that fish is a wonderful developer of the brain; and traces to its influence the fact that fishermen are so murch nore intellectual than farmers. Our fishman don't seem to be very intellectual, and yet he must have a good deal of fish diet, if \he has to eat whatever is left over that he cannot sell; and when it is a little stale, they say there is more phosphorus in it. Dick and Moll are good chil- dren, but if we should have ally more children, especially boys, I shonld like them to have more talent than either of our present ones seems to possess, though why girls should not need brains too, I do not understand. I need brains when 1 have to take care of a household; advise you   A LITTLE BILL.      167 how to invest your money-for you know with- out me you would be sure to lose it-and bring up three-I mean two children. It seems to me that women should be educated as highly as men. I think I shall give them nothing to eat but fish hereafter. The actor Kean said that whenever le was going to act a murderer's part, he ate roast beef for dinner; and when he was to play the lover, he dined on mutton. I let M[oll eat a great deal too much meat, and that gives her such a temper at times, whenever she does not have her own way-that, and your spoiling her, just because she is a girl, while my poor Dick is left without the least notice. I hope it will be a boy, simply to punish you for your unnatural par- tiality." I protested that my affection for the children was entirely equal; although I knew well that Moll, true to her sex, was already beginning to creep into my heart of hearts. Mrs. Gill pro- ceeded thoughtfully: "Fish are verv full of bones, and Dilck inva- riably bolts his food whole. He will be sure to choke himself at every meal; but that is better than growing up to be a fool. Bones in the  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7667-00000084"/> 168      A LITTLE BILL. throat are awkward things to get at, but they are better than no brains in the head." While my wife was reflecting on this antithesis I attempted a little pleasantry. "My dear, perhaps we could tame a stork, to relieve Dick .as the stork of history relieved the lion. Dick does somewhat resembie a lion when aroused-especially in the size of mouth." "Mr. Gill," replied my wife severely, "you need fish diet evidently far more than my poor boy; As if the danger to life of any human be- ing, much more one's child, were a fit subject for weak jokes! so weak that it would be impossible to tell they were jokes, if they were not accom- panied by silly laughter. I suppose you mean that Dick takes his mouth from his mother." This remark was evidently intended to be a defiance; but I refused to be led on, and closed the discussion and the member referred to at one and the same time, and in a way whch I neverfailto find agreeable. She became paci- fied, and continued: "I went to Agassiz's last lecture, but I thought le used too many big words. Perhaps that was the effect of fish diet, however;" and she laughe'd   A LITTLE BILL.      169 merrily at the idea. "He seemed to be more troubled about the bones of fish than I am about fish-bones; only he wanted to get them into a theory, and I want to keep them out of Dicki's throat. Most of what he said was about their arrangement, and yet he did not tell us how to eat a shad, without swallowing them. Still he is a scientific man, and when he says fish are full of phosphorus, and phosphorus is essential food for the brain, he is probably right. Certainly it is our duty to do what we can for our children, to say nothing of improving our own minds; and we mighlt try so simple an experiment." She paused for a moment, to let the matter take form in her mind, and then added: "Well, if you really think we ought to have more fish diet, I am afraid we shall have to change our fishman." "Do you think he serves us with stale fish?." I inquired- anxiously, having a prejudice against putrescent fish, no matter how much brain food they may contain. "Oh no; I am not to be cheated in that way, any longer. There was a time when butchers and bakers and all sorts of tradespeople de- 8  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7667-00000085"/> 10      XA LITTLE BILL. ceived and misled me, just as they pleased. But that day is past. Now   I can tell as well as anybody when there is water in the milk, or alum in the bread; sand in the sugar, or soda in the beer; lard in the butter, or sloe leaves in the tea; dried liver in the coffee, or brick-dust in the red pepper. I have studied up these things; I am ready for the harpies now. No, no fear of stale fsh for me." Tigre was a fierce little air of self-reliance about kMrs. Gill as she said this; and I quite looked upon her as the modern social Jalck tho Giant-killer, slaying the dragons of the dishon- est trading world: a female paladin, not very stout of limb, or broad, perhaps, of girth, but armed with the sword and buckler of study and experience; charging upon the monsters of False- count, Short-weight, and Adulterated Material. A  redoubtable champion, she seemed, and I felt that it would go hard with any evil-mifided store- keeper, who had not the fear of exposure before his eyes, and who should strive to augnment his profits by inadmissible means. Hence I was in- terested in the fate of our provider of fish, whom I  had heretofore regarded as quite a worthy man.   A LITTLE BILL.      171 "Well, my dear," I inquired, "what, then, is the fault you find with our fishman '" "He does not give us correct weight," si an- swered impressively, and with so stern an air that I almost felt a pity for the man whom she had detected, guilty though he was. No doubt my face expressed my concern, for she repeated: "He does not give us correct weight. The very last time I was there, I pointed it out to him. He sold me a codfish. First heoweighed it, and then he .cleaned it." "But, my dear wife," I said, quite relieved- for I was sorry to believe .the poor fellow was a rogue-" that is always done." "So he told me," she replied. "But that does- not make it any more right. Why should he weigh what he does not give me." "But,"  I remonstrated with a smile, "he would willingly send it to you whole and with- out cleaning." "Yes, and he told me that also; but I an- swered him that I did not want him to send me what was not fit to eat. And then he said he had to buy them the same way, as if that made any difference to me. I always make the butcher N  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7667-00000086"/> 172      A LITTLE BILL. trim his meat before he weighs it; and why should not the fishmonger' do likewise? IBe- sides, he does that very thing with halibut. If it is not the custom, it ought to be, and I shall go to every fish-stall in the neighborhood till I find one man who is willing to conduct his business on honest principles. There was a time when any one could cheat me, just like that grocery man Davis, and the tenant Jones. How ridicu- lously credulous I used to be, and how every one trampled on me, and deceived me, and got the; best of me! Was I not confiding and simple and sentimental and generous and trustful and' unsuspicious and contented " she asked, vol- 'ubly but disdainfully. "a But that time is past. Now I am hard as flint and close as a miser, and sharp as a needle, and cunning and watchful, and mean and unbelieving, and heartless. If 'sorrow is knowledge,' I ought to be pretty sad; but I intend to buy fish on honest principles, and not by any one-sided plan simply because it is founded on custom." Mrs. Gill was excited, and I thought it best not to interfere any further in behalf of one who began to appear to me, in the light of her forei-   A LITTLE BILL.       17. ble exposure, more guilty than I had thought. Still I was secretly afraid she might encounter difficulty in carrying out her idea; but she is a woman of resources, and there was no telling what she might accomplish. My impression is, she conquered; for fish began to arrive at our house in great abundance, and in time -for all our meals.   Heretofore she had not been. well acquainted with the individual characteristics of the different representatives of the various finny tribes, but now she made them a study; she learned the difference between perch and trout, catfish and bass, salmon and smelt, mackerel and weak-fish, till she was almost as learned in their peculiarities as a finished ichthyologist; while in selecting them, she could pick out the soundest, freshest, and fattest in a moment. We had abundance of fish, whether they were bought cleaned or uncleaned. There is far more variety about fish than bean  diet, and I considered the change a decided im- provement. Our breakfasts were somewhat too muchl confined to salt fish and fish-cakes, and lunch was perhaps too exclusively of potted her- rings and sardines; but for dinner we fairly rev- I     '   "           *  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7667-00000087"/> 174      A LITTLE BILL. elled in salmon, Spanish-mackerel, king-fish, hali- but, trout, and bass. We had them boiled, baked, fried, broiled, and prepared in a vast vatiety of delicious methods. Then there were the nu- merous shell-fish to fall back upon: the lobsters, crabs, oysters, and scollops. I may honestly say I enjoyed the change after our abstemious course of everlasting beans, and thought I should never tire of the new system. Our brains, too, seemed to improve, and though Dick and Moll 'both were on several occasions on the verge of being choked to death, we began to have decided hopes of their turning out geniuses of the first water. Not that there was any particularly no- ticeable improvement. Dick seemed to experi- ence as much difficulty as ever over the rudi- ments of English spelling, and Moll was still quite indifferent to her letters; but the quanti- ties of fish which they ate proved they were talk- ing a large amount of phosphorus int? their sys- tems, and that must go somewhere.    Their brains were being well nourished, an advantage which, if not immediately visible, was sure to tell in time. Beans had disappeared in the past: they were   A LITTLE BILL.      175 becoming a ghost-like memory. I was glad to bid them a long farewell; for cheap and economi- "cal as they are, and beneficial to the complexion though they may be, my palate never took to them kindly. There .may be advantage in C"knowing beans;" but I was pleased when I knew them no more. I bid them adieu without an expression of regret, and tried to make a fee- ble joke to my wife, almost wishing they never had '" bean;" but as she failed to see it, and as I was five minutes explaining its point, I had little satisfaction from it, although in the end she - laughed heartily, and said it was really excellent. Mrs. Gill does not see a joke quickly. One morning my wife came to me with a sad expression of despair on her countenance, and her hair falling about her fair shoulders in black masses, lying on her white skin like the shadows of night:across the eastern morning sky. She has magnificent hair; when up it covers her head, fold upon fold, like a turban, and when it is down it reaches to her waist and would serve for an impenetrable veil. I am very proud of it, and gazed at it in its luxuriant abundance with delight.    .  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7667-00000088"/> 176      A LITTLE BILL. She stopped before me, and, holding out the comb with which she had been arranging it, said: "Just look how my hair is falling out. It is the same every day. It comes out by handfuls and handfuls at a time. What shall I do?" I looked at the comb, but did not see there was any serious cause for alarm. In dressing such a tangled fleece, of course some would be uprooted; but what was left seemed as profuse as ever. I said as much to her. "How can you talk so!" she answered impa- tiently. "I had good hair once, but see how thin it is growing." She separated some of the folds, just making visible the white skin beneath. "There; you can see it is all gone. It falls out in this way every day, and I shall certainly be bald in time, if I cannot put a stop to it." There was sincere vexation in her tone, but the idea seemed to me so ridiculous that I could not help saying, with a smile: . "Then you will be my   little bald beauty. How funny you will look." -I regretted my want of consideration the mo- ment the words passed my lips.  She did not   A LITTLE BILL.    .   17 utter a single reproach-I should not have minded so much if she had-but her eyes filled with tears, and she turned away from me silcntly with so disappointed a look. Clearly Mrs. Gill cannot appreciate a joke. "My darling," I said at once, taking her peni- tently by the hand, "forgive me. I did not mean any harm, but it seems so absurd for you to talk of becoming bald." "You would laugh at me if I did," she said, her words half choked with the suppressed tears which strove to testify how wounded were her feelings.     . "Indeed I should not; but there is not the least danger of such a thing. Your hair might continue falling out at that rate for a hlundred years without its being noticed.' "You may think so, but I read an advertise- l ment in the newspaper yesterday which warns ; people to watch the first sign of the loss of their hair. It said that diseases of the scalp were most insidious; they made their inroads gradually; if taken in hand in time, they were easily eradi- cated; but if left to themselves they became in- curable, and that those with abundant hair were 8*  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7667-00000089"/> 178      A LITTLE BILL. in more danger than those with less, for they were more negligent." "Such advertisers are invariably quacks," I answered; " don't pay any attention to them." "What am I to do, then?" "Nothing; there is not the least necessity." "And grow bald? You just said you did not care if I did. I see you will not help me, and so I will help myself." She turned away in spite of my protestations, and refused to say another word on the subject, although I expressed the liveliest interest, and in- sisted upon examining the condition of her hair critically. It was all to no purpose. Mrs. Gill was offended, and that meant silence till the wrong from which she suffered was forgotten. Nothing more was said on the subject for a week, when one morning, as she was arranging her toilette, her mind reverted to it. "What do you think?" she observed, with a merry laugh. "Dr. Fleming is a nigger; black as the ace of spades." "My dear," I responded, quite taken aback, "who is Dr. Fleming? I never heard of him, white or black."   A LITTLE BILL.       179 "He is the hair-doctor I told you about. I beg his pardon: Dermatologist is what he calls him- self; that, I suppose, is a sort of capillary profes- sor. It was reading his advertisement which first called my attention to the deplorable condi- tion of my hair." "You surely have not been to him?"I asked disapprovingly. "I certainly have," she answered; for I am sorry to say that at times Mrs. Gill, although generally the model of gentleness and obedience, becomes almost rebellious. At such times I anm careful not to irritate her nerves, which are then in an excitable condition. "When my husband does not care enough for me to assist me," she went on, "I have to take care of myself." She waited for a reply; but I made none, and she proceeded: "Just to think of his being a pure-blooded African,-no one would have known it to read his advertisement." "Would it not have been better to have con- sulted a physician of standing?" -I asked re- proachfully. "Ah, he is a very scientific man," she an-  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7667-00000090"/> 180      A LITTLE BILL. swered at once. "' I aint no nigger barber,' he remarked to me when he was dressing my hair. Besides, he said he was a regular professor, and told me all about the diseases of the scalp. Now how many follicles do you suppose there are in a square inch?" This question was put with a triumphant air of superior learning, but it did not convince me that Dr. Fleming was otherwise than a quack, and, being a colored man, probably less educated and more ignorant than even white quacks. "My dear, before I can answer that question," I replied coldly-for it is never pleasant to con- fess ignorance-- I must know what a follicle is." "There; I thought as much, and yet you con- r demn a man who knows all about them, and has made them the study of his life. There are ten thousand million of them in a square inch." Here she paused to await the effect on my mind of this terrible announcement; but I only said "Indeed?" not being entirely free, in spite of all the amendments to the United States Con- stitution, from the absurd prejudice on account of race, color, and previous condition of servitude. "The hair," she continued, airing her newly   A LI'TTLE  ILL.     181 acquired knowledge, "is nourished and grown precisely like plants in the soil. Beneath the outer scalp is a layer of what oughlt to be called manure; if this is weak or exhausted, the -hair becomes thin; if over stimulated, it falls out. That is the trouble with mine. When we grow \ bald the follicles become compact and grow into a shiny surface, which is as incapable of produc- ing hair as the palm of my hand." "Yes, my dear; but what are follicles?" '"Oh, they are either scales, or dandruff, or pores, or something of that sort. He showed me his band under a microscope, and explained them to me, but I was so engaged trying to make out why the skin was bl#ck, that I never thought of them. But he is really a very learned man/ He said there was a parasite-he called it parricide- which feeds on the marrow contained in each hair, and he showed me one on one of mny hairs. These feed on it till it becomes brittle and breaks off. You can only see them under a microscope. The ' parricide he showed me looked like a little piece of read wool off a aube I had been wearing, and I do not believe it was a; ' parricide' at all." With a little laugh at her own incredulity, she  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7667-00000091"/> 182      A LITTLE BILL. continued: -I got a large bottle of hair-wash from him. It seemed to me dear, but he said, 'What was fifty dollars in comparison with los- ing one's hair?' That is very true; and some people pay more than fifty dollars for a single braid. Besides, he promised if it did me no good to return the money." " They all promise that," I observed scepti- cally, not yet relieved of-my prejudice, in spite of so much tribute to colored learning. "But he is no vulgar impostor," she replied; "the finest ladies in the city come to his place every day; as he said, he 'don't have no hired hacks around.' And there were carriages com- ing, for I  saw them. 1He assured me he had studied under the best doctors here and abroad. Besides, if the wash is not good for the hair, it is excellent for the complexion. He told me of a lady who came to him whose husband neglected her and treated her shamefully just because she (had a red nose. I dare say you would do the same by me if my nose became  red." I protested against such an Imputation, but not with entire success. "Never mind; now I know how to cure it.   ' A LITTLE BILL.      183 Well, this lady only came to him for a month, arid he applied this wash daily. He used to tie a sponge so that it would rest against her nose, and keep it wet with the liquid. She had to sit for hours with this in that position, and must have looked very funny, but it cured her. At the end of that time her nose was as fair-as fair-well, he said as fair as the palm of his hand, but that was black. I suppose he meant as fair as nosps ought to be. If ever my nose gets red and you begin to neglect me, I shall fit a sponge over it, and sit with it wet with this wash day in and day out, till it comes out as white as a colored man's hland." In spite of all these representations I had but little faith, and was not surprised when some few months later, while Mrs. Gill was standing be- fore the glass combing her magnificent hair,-an operation which I always watched with pleasure, --she suddenly broke out vindictively: "I believe that negro hair-doctor is a perfect humbug. The stuff he gave me was good for nothing. It had no more effect on my hair than if it had been so much water; and when I went back and demanded the return of my money, he  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7667-00000092"/> 184      A LITTLE BILL. only gave me a bottle of another mixture for which he charged me twenty-five dollars, and that was as worthless as the first." "My dear," I here remarked triumphantly, "I expected as much." "Then why did you let me go there?" she de- manded promptly. "Why, you forget," I stammered; ,y, ou did not consult me; you went without my knowl- edge." '"I told you my hair was falling out," she an- swered, " and yet you took no interest, not the aeast, and left me to my own resources. Butt I suppose all men are alike!" "Really, my dear," I protested, I thought-" "Well, never mind. It is of no consequence what you thought; you did not do anything. The only wonder is that this quack compound, whch very probably is composed of some deleterious drugs, has not ruined my hair. Perhaps it has. There is a dryness about it which never existed before, and the ends are split: a sure sign that something is wrong; and when I comb it, it comes out worse than ever. I shall demand my money back and positively, this time."   A LITTLE BILL.      185 "Oh my dear," I remonstrated, " you will not like to do that. It will be unpleasant for you.

I shall like it I I just want to tell Dr. Fleming the Dermatologist what I think of him, for once at least."' My wife is a plucky little woman; I confess that I am afraid of her when she is aroused, and had a secret enjoyment at the idea of the con- sternation of Dr. Fleming when his hour should come. Still I said nothing, and Mrs. Gill contin- ued, half by way of expostulation: "There must be something," she said, " which will cure my air. Nature, they tell us, has a remedy for every ill, provided we could .only find it. Since I lost faith in Dr. Fleming I have been trying some of them,--I mean some of those which are so highly spoken of by the daily press. There is Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. That has a fine, rich sound. Anything that has gold or diamonds about it wins my heart at once. And it is surprising how many people it has cured ;  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7667-00000093"/> 186     sA LITTLE SBILL. but it had no effect on me. Then there is Ayers' HairInvigorator, Barry's Tricopherous, and Lyon's Kathairon, each one with a lovely picture of a beautiful young lady combing an unlimited amount of curls. And cosmoline, and vasaline, and so many more I forget their names.  I tried them all; sometimes alone, and sometimes corn- bined. With each bottle came a list of cures. In one instance a man who had been born bald, deaf, dumb, blind, and a cripple; had contracted chronic small-pox, permanent measles, to say nothing of gout, rheumatism, scrofula, chill- blains, tetter, salt-rheum, scarlet-fever, erysipelas, and whooping-cough,-in which he perfectly rev- elled,-was entirely cured and made whole by a single spoonful. When, in spite of these certifi- cates, the remedies failed to do me any good, I made a preparation of my own. It was composed of tannin and rose-water: tannin, because that pre- serves things like leather, you know; and rose- water, to make it smell nice. That was the best of the whole, but not entirely satisfactory." "By the way, ray dear," I  broke in at this point, "speaking of medicines, I could not find my bottle of colchicum the other day when you C   r      Al LITTLE BILL.     187 were out. I have a little premonition of another attack of gout, and may need it. tHave you put it away " Mrs. Gill hesitated a few minutes before she replied, and then said slowly: "It is all used up." "Oh no I you must be mistaken. I remember distinctly that I had just purchased a full bottle." "I used it up," 'again replied Mrs. Gill, still more slowly than before. "You used .it up!"I exclaimed in astoniah- ment. "Why, you have never had a symptom of the gout!" "No," she answered, I took it for the hair. I thought it might do my hair good, so I used half of it externally, and half -of it internally. Oh, how nasty it was! I mean the part that I swal- lowed; I did not mind what went on my head, but what went into it. I would rather take castor- oil at once. Ugh!-  And she made what is called a face, at the recollection. "But who ever told you that colchicum was good for the hair?"I inquired, more surprised than ever. " qNobody; I only thought it might be. All the hair medicines are good for everything else; there  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7667-00000094"/> 188      A LITTLE BILL. is not one which will- not cure a dozen diseases, and some will even cure all manner of ills that horseflesh is heir to, in addition to making the hair as thick as wool on a sheep; and I didn't see why other medicines should not be good for the hair by a species of reciprocity. Snlphur-soap and tricopherous are splendid for the hair, be- sides being death on gout, and hence I thought as colchicum is good for the gout, it ought to be death on the hair. It did not seem to do me much good, but no more did any other of the in- fallible remedies. It will not be wasted anyhow, for you know I inight have the gout one of these days, and that will keep it off." "Mr. Gill," she said after a pause, during which I was vainly endeavoring to recover from the con- fusion of mind into which Mrs. Gill's method of reasoning had plunged me--"Mr. Gill, there is one question I should like to ask you; it is quite important in view of the fact that, as our children are growing up, they will naturally be liable to attacks of sickness, as all children are. Do you expect me to pay for medicines and medical at- tendance out of hy house-money?" "Not at all," r responded at once; "how could   d A LITTLE BILL.       189 yon have imagined such a thing?  I hope we shall escape; but if sickness does come, I expect of course to pay the doctor; not to ask you to do so."5 "Then/' she replied as she drew a paper froln her pocket, "you can let me have the money for this." It was a list of the expenses of her dermatolog- icaT investigations. It began with fifty dollars to Dr. Fleming, and went on with a long array of fives and twos and ones, mounting up to quite a respectable total. I was a little surprised, but her position in relation to it was so manifestly just, that I made no hesitation in at once comply- ing, as soon as I could add up the items. But I fear that all we saved on the beans was lost in the hair-wash, and that the one had no more effect than the other. Looking at Bill, now, as he lies sprawling over the bed, contorting himself into a thousand absurd positions, kicking his legs in every direction, roll- ing his round bullet head vindictively from side to side, and gouging at his big expressionless eyes with his chubby fists, I can only say that his hair is not much to speak of just now. As  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7667-00000095"/> 190      A LITTLE BILL. for his brain, I cannot tell positively about it yet, but we have great hopes for the future. He already utters strange sounds that may be related to some foreign language, and his fond mother thinks she can detect a musical cadence about them. It is possible, therefore, that he will either be a great orator or a wonderful singer. He may be the Mario or the Demosthenes of the future, and we begin to regard him as the genius of the family. He is bound to flower into intellectual renown, and make a noise in the world, or there is no faith to be placed in fish and beans.   CHAPTER VI. A LIVELY SALLY. "Solomon in ah his glory was not arrayed like one of these. "HUSBAND,5" remarked Mrs. Gill, a little over a year after the occurrences detailed in the last chapter, " do you know what my dress weighs?" This question was sudden and wholly unex- pected. I had to confess to myself that although I had -admired Mrs. Gill in her dress, and when she was donning her dress, and even--but we will not speak of that-I had never occupied my mind with studying precisely what her various cover- ings consisted of, much less what they weighed. There seemed to be quite a number of articles of various colors, materials, and kinds which went to make up the perfect woman, as completed to meet the eye of man, but what they were for or what number of pounds or ounces they might weigh was quite beyond my power of estimating. I had to make the humiliating admission of ignorance. "That is so like you men," she answered a little  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7667-00000096"/> 192     A LIVELt SALLY. tartly, when she heard my apologetic acknowl- edgment; "you take good care to have your own clothes as comfortable as possible, and leave us bound down, hampered, constrained, annoyed, and injured by our dress with an unconcern which you consider to be lordly, and which is certainly manlike if not manly. Suppose you had a mailed coat strapped around your waist and drawn so tight you could hardly breathe: a perpetual straight-jacket of steel and whalebone; or if you only had strings girding you and girding you, preventing your digestion and keeping your din- ner all right here "-and she thumped the pit of hier stomach with her closed fist viciously-" what would you say?" "Why, my dear, I should say that it was ex- tremely disagreeable, and should take off such in- struments of torture as quickly as possible." "And," she said with bitter reproach, " you leave us to endure such torments daily from child- hood up." "Really, my treasure," I remonstrated, "I did not suppose men were responsible for woten's dress, or had much to say about it. If they had, I think most husbands would favor a decided   A LIVELY SALLY.      193 modification of the present extravagant fashions of female apparel." "I dare say," she replied, ' they would like to cut off the ornaments and reduce the expenses; would bring us back to the cheap stuff and skimpy gowns of our grandmothers. Anything to save money. They are usually of one mind about tliat. Not that I give you much cause to complain--I should say, or much ground to accuse me of ex- travagance.  A certain gray light appearing in Mrs. Gill's eyes warned me that I must explain myself, and I hastened to modify my remark. ' I am only speakingsf men and women gen- erally," I explained. "If all men had as sensible and moderate wives as I have, there would never be another word said about female extravagance." "If you want me to spend less on my dress, I will try to do so,"' she whimpered in a reproach- ful little voice, her mood changing, and the faintest shadow of a tear glistening in her eyes. "I can make my last year's black silk do for another season: it is not very shabby. I do not like to darn my stockings, for darns hurt my feet when I walk, but I can stay in the house, although 9  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7667-00000097"/> 194     A LIVELY SALLY. open air and sunshine are almost a part of my life. And just now I should have wished to buy a new wrapper, as I gave away my old one to a poor woman who was sick and did seem to need it so much; but I will try and get along without, if yon would prefer." I had to disclaim promptly any such desire, and to declare that the only fault I found with ZMrs. Gill was that she did not buy enough new dresses, and had to insist upon ler getting a new wrapper that very day, before I could bring her back to herself and the subject she had on her mind. "I My clothes are beconing a little tight for me," she remarked with a blush, "and I wanted to hear Mrs. Susan Everett lecture on dress, to see if I could not find some way of making theln more comfortable. But I made a mistake and went to the wrong lecture. To-morrow is the day for dress. Yesterday she only told us how to treat our servants and attend to our households and cook- our dinners and take care of onrlhealth- things about which I  am sure I could tell her more than she could tell me. Did yon not make me try all sorts of absurd washes for my hair, under the ridiculous notion that it was falling out   A LIVELY SALLY.      195 when it had nothing at all the matter with it, and is thicker than ever now? I only wonder that some of those quack nostrums did not make it fall out or turn it gray, as they very often do. And then how you compelled me to live on fish, and beans, and Graham bread. When I look back over it all, Mr. Gill,' burst out my wife with a ringing laugh, " it does seem to me that you did not behave very wisely. How patiently I en- dured it all.

Now, if I had given herstrong allopathic doses there is no telling what might have -been the, result. Still, there is an inconvenience about having to admin- ister a teaspoonful of a decoction every half hour, or so. If the water were not discolored the-chil- dren would never find out- it was medicine, and would not mind it; but Dick knows at once, the moment he sees it, and iragines it has a bad taste, whether it has or not. Hle shuts his mouth and clinches his teeth, and though I drink a dozen spoonfuls before him to show him that it is not disagreeable, he only screams the louder. In the end I always have to force his mouth open, and then the liquid goes the wrong way, and he nearly chokes to death and; grows blackl in the face. I think I shall- have to treat Dick, at least, on the allopathic system, and get an effectual dose down at once, and be done with it, instead of worrying him every few mnintues to take a drink of dirty water."  Mrs. Gill's mind, dwelt silently on this prob-   A LIVEL Y SALLY.      197 lem, and then slowly reverted to Mrs. Everett's other subject of discourse. "As for servants, who could tell me anything about them, unless she would inform me where to get a good one? I am thoroughly educated in the domestic question. They have been the bane of my existence, and taken the joy out of my life, and made me old before my time. They are the curse which has hung over our household as a pall; each one has been a Nemesis, not to punish us for our faults, but for keeping house at all. I am weary to death of it, and long to be at rest." Mrs. Gill's bright, cheerful, vigorous marner made quite a contrast to her lugubrious words. She proceeded: "I have often wondered what we are coming to next. I have tried all nationalities, with one unvarying wretchedness of result. Irish, Ger- man, French, Italian, Hebrew, everything but Swede. They do say the Swedes are the best; and I saw one once advertised by an intelligence office '  At this point, Mrs. Gill paused; her active mind gliding away from the matter in hand  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7667-00000099"/> 198     A L VEY:Z SALL . when another subject for inquiry presented it- self. "By the way, Mr. Gill, why do they call labor agencies 'Intelligence offices'? Tlhey are the last places in the world I should took for intelli- gence, either in the managers, who never seem to be able to distinguish a decent girl from the veriest drab, and who advertise a parcel of worth- less creatures as angels of domestic service-or in the girls, whose only evidence of intelligence is exhibited in trying to get good money for bad work. Well, this one advertised that Be had a splendid Swedish girl but when I went thlere and paid mjy money, he told me she was just hired, and offered me a lot of superior Irish just imported; as if I had not had enough of Irisli superiority already i Superiorindeed! Yes, they are superior to blacking your boots, and we have to get a boy to come, and pay him fifty cents a week to -do it. And superior to sweeping the sidewalk, and that necessitates the boy atain. Or to carry lome parcels-fortunately the shop-keepers have boys for that, and we are  not compelled- to pay extra for that too. But then they are superior to bringing up furnace ^      i   ashes out of the cellar, and we have to get a man every spring for that, or to take coals upstairs, or do anything they can help. No, I did not want any superior Irish; but next day, I saw by , the papers that the same man advertised another Swedish girl; so I went right back to- him and asked for her. He said she had been snapped up';. too. Well, the following daySI saw the sne adz-- vertisement again. It turned out in the end that he had no Swedish girl at all; never had had but one, and on that he kept his advertisement run- ning daily. I do believe that was the only Swe- dish girl ever in this country. I would like the French girls pretty well," continued Mrs. Gill after a pause, in which the vista of comparative domestic demerits seemed passing before lier mental eye: " were it not that there are so many strange words in that language. And then no one ever knows how- little one really does under- stand of French, till they try to talk about house- hold -affairs. There, now, is dish-cloth; what is the French for dish-cloth, do you suppose?" This question was put to me suddenly and rather viciously. I should have given a good deal to have been able to answer it correctly. In  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7667-00000100"/> 200     A LIVELY RSALLY. fact, rather than confess my ignorance, I made several wild guesses, such as serviette and essuie- main, but only brought the greater mortification upon myself. "There, now, just as I supposed. You dlon't know anything about it, and yet one must talk of a dish-cloth fifty times a day. In fact, tile more you don't know dish-cloth, the, more dish- cloth fores itself on your hourly attention. In- stead of avague abstraction kept in corners and hidden behind doors, dish-cloth becomes a present and conspicuous reality to you, hovers over your head, clings to your daily steps, and follows you persistently wherever you go. There is no escape from dish-cloth, if you have not torchon on the end of your tongue. Then country French girls do not seem to understand the Parisian idiom. I have hknown one to stand staring at me like an idiot, instead of obeying a simple direction which I had given her in the plainest language. Can you imagine anything more stupid?" I agreed with Mrs. Gill very heartily in her astonishment at the French people's ignorance of the Parisian tongue, and she went on: "Olive Logan says that if we treated them as   A LIVELY SAALLY.      201 equals, and made companions of them, we should get on better. But there are disadvantages about that system too. I never found them exactly whatI should call entertaining in general conver- sation. Of course I do not mean to say that the fault was entirely on their side; perhaps I was as uninteresting to them astlthey were to me. They are often fluent; there is Annie, for in- stance: she almost talks me to death whenever I go in the kitchen; I am afraid actually to speak to her, even on household affairs; she over- whelms mne with such a torrent of eloquence. If I ask her to make a rice-pudding for dessert, she immediately informs me minutely, and with the greatest amplifications, how she made rice-pud- dingr for Mrs. General Jones, and how much sugar she used to put in for -Irs. Senator Smith, and how Mrs. Assemblyman Brown would not allow a drop of milk, and so on and so forth, till I it wish all the rice in the world was at the bottom of the sea, and Annie making puddings of it for Mrs. Mermaids. Try as hard as I might, I do not think 1 could enjoy their society socially. Moreover, it sometimes happens, in spite of Olive Logan, that the better you treat them the worse  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7667-00000101"/> 202     A LIVELY SALLY. they treat you. There was Moll's old nurse Kate, whom we always treated so kindly, getting a boy to carry up wood and coal to the nursery, and hiring a little girl every Sunday to watch the children, that she might go to mass three times, and church all the rest of the day, and come back cross as a fiend when all was over; for going to church seemed only to make her temper worse; and the more pious she was, the more she tookl it out of everybody. Well, to think of her leaving us after all, just when both the children were sick with scarlet-fever, and Moll ready to cry her eyes out after her, add refusing to have any- thing to do with'the new girl, or take either food or medicine from her. Do you call that Chris- tian conduct, I should like to know?" I   was by no means prepared to say that I did look upon it in that light, and Mrs. Gill went on : "That was the worst case I ever knew, for I will say they are generally good to children, but too much piety had made her mad.- How she used to bullyrag the small boy that carried the wood and coal{ I would have pitied him if he had not made it a rule to drop pieces of coal and streaks of cinders all over my new stair carpets,   A LIVELY SALLY.      203 in spite of whatever I could say to him. He had put- me so out of patience, that my hands fairly itched to box his ears sometimes, and I never felt that I quite fulfilled my duty to him and society in -not doing so. If I had, he would leave re- membered it when he grew up, and it might have made another man of him."' Mrs. Gill paused to consider the lost opportu- nity, and to reflect upon the influence which she ought to have exerted and had not, and her mind gradually reverted to the subject upon which it was first exercised. ("It weighs fourteen pounds," she said, with dramatic and startling suddenness. "What," 1 exclaimed, " the coals . That must have been a pretty good load for the boy." I am sorry to say that my mind does not move with the rapidity of Mrs. Gill's; and while hers had slipped away to the question of dress, mine was still lingering over the delinquencies of domestics. I saw in a moment that I had made a mistake. "Mr. Gill," she said impatiently, "I should think you might take a little interest in my com- fort, as well as my health. I really should sup-  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7667-00000102"/> *  A rllllC XasLs/21JY. pose that on those subjects you could spare me at least a few moments of your attention." "Really, my dear," I tried to explain, "I thouglt you were speaking to me about the boy carrying a scuttle of coals upstairs." "Don't be absurd, if you please. If I had been, how should I possibly know the weight of a scuttl-of coals? Or of what consequence is it either? I was speaking of my own clothes, Mdr. Gill, not of coals." "Fourteen pounds, my dear," I said,; hastening to display a lively interest. "Impossible! yaou must make some mistake, or you   never could carry such a weight.' ' But I assure you it does," she answered, tak- ing a paper from  her pocket. "I have weighed it piece by piece, and here is a list of the exact weight of each.  I brought the scales into my room, and taking off my clothes, tried one article after the other. I am not quite sure that those scales are correct, for when I weigh the meat that the butcher sends us, it is never as heavy byi a   good pound, and sometimes more as what he charges me for; and he told me when I  c(m- plained about it, that scales will get out of order :iS - .  ' ' -"  ,   .    . -' ii   and get stiff, unless they are used all the time. But by those scales it weighs fully fourteen pounds. There is my seal-skin sacque, that weighs two pounds and a quarter; my velvet polonaise, three pounds; my red felt petticoat, three quarters of a-pound." At-this point, Mrs. Gill looked up from her list, and again turned a pair of reproachful eyes full upon me.  "You accused me of extravagance a moment ago," she said; and although I struggled to deny the accusation, she paid no heed to my protests; "you charged me with following the fashions, and spending money wastefully in buying un- necessary and unreasonable dresses; and yet you know I wear a red felt petticoat, where other women buy the most expensive flannel, and wear. dozens and dozens of white ones every week, just to fill out their figures. I hardly expected such a reproach from you." 'But, my dear, it was a mistake; I did not mean it," I managed to explain in a confused way. "I meant that you did not buy dresses enough," I added boldly; but Mrs. Gill was still stony and unconvinced, so I resorted to flattery,  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7667-00000103"/> 206     A LIVELY 8ALLY. like a coward: "Besides, with your beautiful figure, you need nothing of the sort; other women require additions to their shapes, but with you, that is wholly unnecessary." "Well, never mind," she replied coldly;"I did not expect it, that's all, and it only shows how little use there is in a wife's trying to please her husband, and be saving and economical. You may be sure of one thing: I shall not try that any more; a wife is more respected the more she spends. I was saying my petticoat weighed three quarters of a pound-if you will please put that down, and not spend your time abusing- me for extravagance when I don't deserve it. I want you to add up the amounts, for thlere are so many halves and quarters that I can't get them to come out right. Then there are boots, hat, and waist, two pounds and a half. My black satine skirt is a pound and a half, and my best black silk suit weighs three pounds and a quarters while my common silk weighs two, and three quarters. -But that is only an American silk, and I never will get another American silk as long as I live; they are good for nothing, and Stewart is right in giving up keeping them alto-   A LIVELY  SALLY.    207 gether. Why, just look how rusty that is; I saw you were ashamed to go out with me to the theatre the other night?  "Really, my dear," I confessed depecatingly, "I cannot tell one dress from another." "Now, don't tell me anything of that sort; you know better. It is very discouraging when a person dresses up to suit her husband, and makes herself look as nicely as she can, and then have him assume a lordly air of indifference, and pre- tend he don't know what she has on, and does not care. You do know my best sillk dress from my ordinary one perfectly well." ,My darling, I admire you personally so much that I hardly think of anythin g else. In any dress you are beautiful; you adorn your clothes: they can lend no grace to you." "That is simply ridicutlous" she replied de- cidedly; and yet I could fancy she was mollified. "Pretty I would look dressed up-like a rag- picker, or in some guy of a gown like a Dutch Katrina justarrived from Faderland. But never mind that. I wish you would pay attention to what I was telling you about the weight of my clothes, and not go rambling off on all sortse I ohs    sa  o v1-  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7667-00000104"/> 208     A lIVELY SALLY. of indifferent topics. Have you everything down? "Yes. Is that all?" -'*No, you foolish fellow, of course not. Do- yon imagine a woman wears nothing under her dress but one petticoat? Suppose her waist should rip." At this suggestion, Mrs. Gill laughed a merry, blushing laugh, and pretended to hide her face with one little hand. In a moment, however, she resumed with her accus- tomed solemnity. "Underclothes, watch, and portmonnaie, etc., etc., you can put down at three pounds and a half.;" "Butt,my dear," said I, laying down my pencil and speaking very seriously, "do you think that is sufficiently explicit?" "What do you mean?" she asked innocently. "I think," I replied slowly, " that you liad better mention the underclothes in detail." "I think I'll mention my hand in connection with your ears, if you talk in that'way," she answered. "And now tell me what it all comes to?" "Why, as I make out," I replied, "your dress weighs nineteen pounds and a quarter." (    A LIVELY SALLY.      209 "It cannot be as muchl as that!" "Well, if the items are correct, it must be. They are as follows: seal-skin, two and a quar- ter; polonaise, three; petticoats, three-quarters; boots, etc., two and a half; satine skirt, one and a half; silk dress, three and a half; silk dress, two and three quarters.-" ; Oh, you stupid!

"Oh, don't bother! As if you had not sense enouLgh to tell which went together! You need not have mixed them all up!

But there, you have made me for-  -get my forty breaths!"I,  She uttered this last sentence in a loud excla- mation, which, by its suddenness and incompre- hensibility, quite alarmed me. Then she sprang up and rushed to the window, threw open the sash, and standing before it, became suddenly motionless, stricken with paralysis, as it were,- and seemed to be struggling for breath till she turned red in the face. In the effort her breast heaved and swelled; her eyes grew fixed and dilated; her muscles became rigid; her hands were clenched; and in the end, she began beat- ing herself frantically on the chest. At first I was bewildered at the suddenness of the attack; but recovering myself before the paroxysm reached its height I sprang to her side, caught her in my arms, and lifted her from her feet to carry her to the sofa. "My darling," I cried frantically, "what is it? What is the matter with you  Speak to me, speak to me! tell me what is the matter with you."

Go away 1 don't touch me! leave me alone 1" She spoke so strongly that I released her, sup- posing I had made a mistake or the trouble had passed. But no sooner had I done so than the same symptoms once more appeared. Again her breath was drawn- in with one long sustained in- halation; againr er chest expanded and ex- panded, till it seeed almost to burst; again her checks and face were congested with the injected blood; again her eyes stared expressionless, and her arms became cramped; and again, after beating herself on the bosom, shte poured out the confined air in a strong exhalation. ," My darling , I cried in an agony of appre- hension at the renewal of so imcomprehensible an attack, "what shall I do? IIow can I re- lieve you? Try and tell me what is the matter- where you feel the pain, and what is the cause." But she did not answer, and I began to observe unmistakable signs that the fit was coming on once inore.  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7667-00000106"/> 212     A ' AIEILLy Ll r T  "Resist it!"I begged, almost beside myself with terror. "Try and restrain yourself! Wait till I get some water!" I rushed to the wash-basin, and hastily draw- ing a tumbler of water, ran back with it, and was about to dash it in her face, when she caught my hand and instantly resumined her self-control. "Don't be silly," she said calmly and some- what contemptuously.  "This is no the for play." "But what are you doing? What is the mat- ter " I  asked, half frightened still and half annoyed. "I told you I  am taking my forty breaths," was her deliberate answer. "You almost made me forget them, with your talk about dress and your abuse about extravagance." "Forty breatlis," I said, at as great a loss as ever. "What, in Heaven's name, are forty breaths? Please don't do it any more,Tor you will have an attack of apoplexy!" "Don't be a goose!" was her reply, uttered in a   pause between two convulsions, which still alarmed me considerably, although I began to perceive they were voluntary and not dangerous.   A LIVELY SALLY.       213 "CDon't be a goose! I am only following Mrs. Evcrett's directions." Before proceeding any furtherl in her explana- tion, she once more swelled up like a frog in the fable, till she seemed to my uneasy eyes to be douDle her natural size, and on the very verge of the frog's fate, when she again collapsed with a sigh which seemed to shake her entire body. After that was over, and while panting to re- cover the control of hier lungs, she continued her explanation. 'Mrs. Everett said we ought to inhale forty breaths three times a day, each one being carried to the full extent of our lungs, and maintained as long as possible. By so doing we bring the oxy- gen of the atmosphere into every portion of our lungs, and thus utilize each distinct and separate particle of the blood." At this point the explanation was interrupted, by a renewed spasm of inhalation, and I had to wait till that -was concluded before I had any  further account of this new style of medication. "The lunrgs are sponges," M3rs.

Ordinarily, however, we only breathe from our chests, what is called cla- vicular breathing; whereas to effect thorough respiration, we should exercise the abdominal muscles, and move the diaphragm strongly." The operation was exemplified by a repetition of what I had at first mistaken for a sort of epi- leptic fit, at the termination of which slie continued: "No complete respiration can be secured with- out deep breathing, so as to bring the air into all the cells of the lungs. Women neglect this, and with them the walls of the abdomen often become weak, from their muscles not being suf- ficiently used. Mrs. Everett says that no one will suffer from indigestion, if they follow her di- rections.- Only it does seem to me that it requires considerable time. I tried it yesterday by the clock, and it took me nearly three-quar- ters of an hour to complete my- forty respirations, and then I slurred over the last ones because I was tired." At this point the regular interruption occurred. When it was over, M]rs. Gill went on: "She told me that she could never hold her   A LIVEL Y SALLY.       i5 breath more than thirty seconds, but I think I can do more than that.

"You shall do nothing of the sort," I inter- posed quite angrily, alarmed at the idea of my wife carrying her researches into the region of science so far as to propose to exhibit herself at Niblo's in a bathing-dress, in a trial of endurance against a man who was striving to make himself amphibious. '"It is enough for professional actors to make exhibitions of themselves. I will not allow you to attempt such a thing." She waited till she had completed an impend- ing inhalation, and then responded: "Why, Mdr. Gill, what do you mean?

"Not in that way," I answered, determined not to yield to such a whim under any pressure.

"Mr. Gill," asked Mrs. Gill, slowly and seri- ously, " are you crazv? What do yon mean by your talk of my entering the tank? I told you I wanted to see the 'fish-man' at Niblo's, that I might time myself by holding my breathl when hewent under water; and you say I sliall not do it. Indeed- I will! I am not unreasonable, Mr. Gill, and if you have any substantial objection-- " "Pardon me," I interrupted her. -"I misun- derstood you. Of course you shall go. This very day, if you prefer." "Then why did you forbid me in that brutal way . If I was proposing to do anything wrong, it was not necessary to speak so coarsely; but what is there wrong in going- to Niblo's? Of course the  man must be dressed," and she blushed slightly at the suggestion implied. ' F orgive me," I apologized further, not caring to explain more fully, my mistake, which seemed too absurd, now that I thought of it, althocugh at first it had appeared perfectly possible that Mrs. Gill, habiting her graceful form like a mermaid, and with her abundant hair floating down her   A L1VELY SALLY.       217 back, and the conventional siren's comb in her hand, should have tested the comparative capac- ity of male and female lungs for the benefit of science, in the presence of an appreciative audi- ence, and against a fellow who had made hold- ing his breath the aim and object of his life. "I was excited," I explained as well as I could, "and did not mean what I said." "Then try and speak plainer hereafter, al- though I don't see what there was to get excited about in talking of holding one's breath thirty seconds. I am sure you could do better, and wish you would try. I want you to, see if you do not feel stronger for it, and if you cannot keep it up longer than evon I can." It may seem a little absurd, but so contagions is example, and so natural is it for me to do any- thing which Mrs. Gill commands, that in five minutes I found myself standing beside her at the open window, vieing with her in inhaling air to the utmost capacity of my chest. Perhaps I was somewhat influenced by the satisfactions  I had in watching the gradual display of the graces of her form, as her- breast was slowly expanded, and the dress drawn tighter and tighter over it; 10   &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7667-00000109"/> 218     A L1SLY SALLY.\ for, strange as it may appear, I never grow tired of studying the personal beauties of my chllarming and attractive wife. So there we stood, side by side, like a pair of animated bellows; .alternately inhaling or  I breaths in deepest inspirations, retaining the air in our expanded lungs until we felt insensibility a approaching  and congestion threatening our brains, and then exhaling the exhausted blood  stimulant, after we had thorouglly pounded our chests in order to loosen any cellular tissue whichl disease might have rendered inactive. As the window was -wide open, blind and sash, our op- posite neighbors may have noticed the remarka- ble spectacle, and wondered at its meaning; but 7 so infectious was the study of hygiene and devo. tion to scientific investigation, that I never so  much as thought of this, but concentrated my entire efforts on endeavoring to hold ny breath  the longest possible time; and was particularly proud when, at the risk of sudden dissolution, I  managed to keep it tup for an entire minute. So X rngrossed were we that we did not hear the door )f the roomn open, nor the pattering of little feet, IS the  sprouting branches of our increasingX   A LIVEL Y SALLY.       219 family-tree entered the room. We did not per_ ceive Dick and 1oll, who had come to pay us a visit, and who stood silent and surprised close to the open door, gazing with fear and wonder at the spectacle. Ignorant of their presence, we continued with our exercises, again and again swelling our bodies and breasts to the utmost ex- tent, without uttering a word. The children were equally silent; they stood as if stricken into marble, unable to malke any- thing of the astounding exhibition.   Slowly Moll's big, expressive eyes began to dilate and dilate; the blood gradually crept up into her cheelks and forehead alid nose; more and more earnest grew her stare as they stood there un- noticed by us, while we continued  our heavy medicinal respirations, convulsing ourselves in our efforts to outdo one another.  Dick at first was no less astonished; le, too, had paused and suppressed his customary cry of delight;  but the ludicrousness of the situation affected him, and the expression of awe at first - appearing on his countenance gave way to one of syvmpathy, and then to a happy smile of pleasure.   But yet neither of them moved, and we, oblivious to their &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7667-00000110"/> 220     A LIVELY SALLY.   , presence, coptinued-our exercises, side by side, standing otherwise immovable before the open window, swelling and contracting, swelling and contracting; pounding our sides and chests and bodies with our hands, and pouring out the deep inspirations in heavy sighs. The blood had cir- culated with quickened throbs through our pulses and into our brains, and mounted into our faces and flushed them to tunusual red, and still we kept on passing from one semi-convulsion into another, in blind observation of scientific co1n; manfds, and in total ignorance of our audincle. Suddenly our operations were interrupted: Moll set up a yell which could be heard a block off, and which clearly established the fact that her lungs were in -no need of artificial development; while Dick, stepping up alongside of us, with a shout of delight, said : 'I'm is a rooster, too! I'm is I! I can -play rooster as well as mamma and papa!" and pro- ceeded at once to prove his accomplishment by puffing himself out into as near the shape of a lordly chicken,-proud husband of a dozen wives, -as I had no doubt myself been doing a moment before.   A LIVELY SALL Y.      221 This closed our exercises, for it required all Mrs. Gill's attentions to Moll to prevent that young lady, whose face was a deep purple, from goi0ng into the real fit which I had originally supposed Mrs. Gill to be suffering from, and all the terrors of her future reproaches at my heartlessness to prevent my giving way to unseemly and ill-timed laughter. It was some days before I heard of Mrs. Ever-   ^ ett again. I was in my dressing-room complet- ' ing my toilet when Mrs. Gill called me. :: ;  "My dear" she said, c"I wish you would h    F me arrange these thngs; I do not understaid them."              ?! I came to her assistance at once, and found her trying to put a couple of bands of ribbon across her shoulders to blttons which werj seRed on her underskirts.

I was busy contemplating Mrs. Gill's form at that moment. She was clad in that ost becom- ing of female costumes, tlat which precedes tle final shrouding of her form in the respectable and enwrapping dress. Around her white shoulders was the scarcely whiter flted fringe of the chemisette, half hiding, lalf r irealing the beauties of her bust, and ruoning like a gar- sland of tioers across her plump and shapely back. 'Her round, soft arms were bare their Whole length, and their everwy ovement deep- ened0 some dimple or revealed some ne, and beautiful expression of tleir plastic mes- cles. The  bodice fitted accurately to the rounded outlines of her shape down to her waist, while below swept her slirt in anple fold, setting close to the glorious swell of her form, and just revealing the tiny feet and small-boned anlses below. Was it a wonder that I was engrosse "You are not attending to me,", said Mrs. Gill reprovingly; anlld if you do 'lot care to hear what I have to say, you can return to your dress- ing-room."   A LIVELY SALL Y.      223 This brought me back to myself, and I -stam- -mered out some excuse, protesting the most earn- est attention; which was strictly true, if not in the sense she wished. a Her principal condemnation was directed against corsets," continued Mrs. Gill. She said that corsets had killed more people than cholera; that they were worse than the great plague. And I agree with her," affirmed my wife, authori- tatively; " they are the greatest plague. They are such a bother to lace and unlace; to put on in the morning and take off at nightS But that was not what she meant: she said they were ruinous to health; that no woman could wear them and live long or be healthy. I never felt sick in consequence of having them on, but I may have been sick without knowing it; people often are, as everyone who has studied physics knows. Or perhaps I may have escaped because mine were so loose. You know   they hardly touched me. But she says that makes no differ- ance, and that they press all the same, even when habit has hardened us into insensibility.

T, of death, without being in the least aware of it."  Mrs. Gill paused to let this remark have its proper effect. Holding the loose ends of several strings and ribbons in her hands, her eyes blad  i been directed towards them; now they met nine. An expression of displeasure crossed her features. "Mr. Gill, you are not attending to me!" she said severely. "May I ask what you are thinking of . What it is that so engrosses your mind that you cannot spare a moment for your wife's health and comfort? You would oblige me by inform- ing me, and we will discuss that matter first, and then my health may be an after-consideration." "Really," I stammered, "I was only looking- I mean admiring-I would say-"  Then recov- ering my self-possession, I explained, "' I was no- ticing that you had left off your corsets." Now, Mr. -Gill,'" she replied reproachfully, athis is a little too bad.

In  her excitment, Mrs. Gill let slip one of the ribbons she was holding, and in her en- deavors to rcover it, threw one graceful arm across the whitest of white shoulders, and learly confirmed her statement as to her orsets. Sle captured the truant, and with arms aliinbo and hands crossing- her breast, each one holding one end of the ribbon, she proceeded: "In the end they utterly destroy the human fig ure; the bones and ribs are completely warped ot of place, while the fesh is rolled into unsigltly, 10*  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7667-00000113"/> -226     A LI VE L Y SALLY. hideous layers, or folds, or humps wholly unlike a natural form: a most disgusting and offensive sight." I was quite alarmed at such a prospect, but from what I saw thought it must be a mistake. "Why," I said, "there is no sign of such a thing with you." " "Mr. Gill," she replied with a frown, "I pre- fer to have no personal allusions-if you please; above all, such offensive as well as absurd ones. I should think not. I am not accustomed to con- sidering myself hideous and unsightly. I am not aware that I have disgusting layers of flesh about me. I do not thank you for even such an insinuation." "But you told me you used to wear corsets!" I answered by way of palliation. "Such results do not happen with every person, nor at once," she retorted promptly. "We will not argue the proposition; I prefer not. I am not twenty-five yet by several years, and iMrs. Everett says that up to that time, any one can give up  i the habit of corset wearing, which, as I have told you, I have done.

"Nothing would give me more pleasure, if I only knew exactly what they were for." ,Oh dear! how often must I explain it to you," was her answer with an air of bitter resig- nation. "I told you distinctly that no woman could wear a corset and live, and that to save my life I had dispensed with my dorset, and that now I was tormented with the strings wlwhich went round my waist, and was trying to arrange sup- porters over my shoulders, as Mrs. Everett rec- ommends. There, now, I hope you understand me, and will not make me repeat and repeat, while I am standing here holding these tiresome ribbons) till I am ready to drop." "I am fully of your opinion." I coincided promptly, taking man's instinctive view of the stiff armor which woman wears, and which to his touch has often seemed so hard and inanimate; for I believe men hate corsets, simply because they are disagreeable to hug. "But these horrible strings are almost as bad, sl'e replied, pulling viciously at the stri;ngs which went round her waist and sustained her skirts.  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7667-00000114"/> 228     A LIVELY SALLY. "They are enough to kill ally one who wears them." "Why, my dear, I should have supposed that nature made women expressly to carry weights by her waist; certainly they calnnot slip downl, and I gazed admiringly at her beautiful shape. '"But they can sag and pull and draw and bind. Oh, they are horrible! and Mrs. Everett says women ought to wear suspenders like men; and I should think you might help me put these on instead of standing there gaping with your mouthl open like a drivellingl idiot." Mrs. Gill's language is occasionally more forci- ble. than politeness would dictate, but possibly at that moment my attention was a little too much engrossed by attractions. which her vigorous movements had revealed. I hastened to comply with her directions, and give her the aid of my superior experience in thew matter of suspenders, which were practically what she was endeavoring to arraiinge; while she, on her part, proceeded with her reminiscences of the lecture she had heard: "Yes, as I was saying, corsets ruin the shape; and if you were to see one of our fashionable women --and I have often observed how you stare at   A  I LEL Y SALLY.    229 every stylishy dressed or pretty woman we pass in the street, and how, I have no doubt, you com- pare me unfavorably to her, because I do not run in debt for costly clothes, nor squeeze in my waist like a consumptive wasp--if yon were to see one of them  without their clothes, you might be of another opinion. There was exhib- ited in the hall, a model of Venus and a mani- kin of a modern fine lady, after years of corset- lacing ;-I thought they ought to call it womani- kin. If strong-minded women want to show their independence of man, they ought to drop his masculine appellations. Well, the contrast was astonishing; but then, just imagine a Greek statte in a modern dress. I had half a mind to ask Mrs. Everett to put a hoop-skirt and a flounced dress and an overskirt and a hat and gloves and boots and patent palpitators, and all that, on her model of Venus, and see how she would turn out. I do not believe Venus would stand it any better than we do, nor perhaps half so well, with her big waist of twenty-six inches, and her ungainly feet. She would have to be squeezed in, and settled up, to b6e fit to be seen, and then her boots would be simply enormous.  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7667-00000115"/> 230     A LIVE ElY 8ALL. It is all very fine to compare us who have on hats and cloaks and waists and skirts and under-_ skirts, and-and-and-with a half-naked ancient woman with nothing on but a sheet. Suppose we all wore sheets, with whicll we paraded up and down Broadway, and which we swung over our shoulders, or hung round our armns, or let flat- ter in the breeze. What would you say to that ? It might be artistic, but, for my part, I should not call it decent, and it would be awfully cold. No; the only way to institute 'a just comparison is to put your ancient statue in a Inodern dress, and then see how she would look." No occupation could possibly be more agreeable than the one in whiclhI was engaged. I became engrossed in it deeply and enthusiastically. Even the comparison of ancient and modern beauty, which Mrs. Gill was innocently making, seemed to me peculiarly appropriate. I studied it out with the specimen of the moderns which I had before me, and so near my eyes, and under my very touch, which science tells us is the true test of form.     Whether Venus was made in antici- pation of what Mrs. Gill was going to realize, or Mrs. Gill was modelled  after the contour of    A LIVELY BALL 7.      231 Venus, I cannot say; but if Mrs. Gill were to be converted into stone, or Mrs. Venus into flesh and -blood, and they were both to be mixed up, I should have much trouble in picking out what belonged to me, and art would remain for- ever in doubt as to which was its pet model. I went to my work of adjusting braces, straps, and bands with solid satisfaction; nor was the job an easy one.   Certain inequalities which did not exist in man, were precisely in the way of the suspenders. There was also a soft- ness about the texture of the skin, which seemed easy to be abraded, while I felt unaccountable unwillingness to cover up her pretty shoulders with ugly and disfiguring straps. Still I kept at the attempt. I fitted and refit- ted and fitted again; I tried this arrangement and that arrangement, this position and that position; I made temporary combinations, with the aid of pins instead of buttons,-and changed them from place to place; I shortened and lengthened alternately the ribbons; and in every new arrangement I of course had to smooth down the full length of the straps carefully and tenderly with my hand. The touch was electric ,  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7667-00000116"/> 232     A LIVELY SALL Y. and confusing; and no plan seemed to answer. Something was the matter with me, or else women and suspenders are not meant for one another. Still the lady was voluble and her conversation flowed on. I am sorry to say that I was not as attentive as I should have been, but perhaps I was excusable. "The points are these," she said wilt oracular earnestness: "instead of inventing new fashions, each sillier than the last, and hardly remaining long enough for one to get accustomed to them, we should design a dress for women which should be light, warm, and comfortable. Not a long train, dragging on the ground and entantglingr your feet and draggling ilithe mud or sweeping the dust, but something which would just clear your feet. Of course no rlespeetable woman thinks of assuming man's costume; there is no sense in that, but there is also no reason that we should drag yards upon yards of cloth after us, like a dragon's tail. Then while we are covering the ground, we neglect our shoulders; what we waste on one end, we steal from the other. Look at a man when he goes out for a cold winter's   A LI1VELYSALLY.       233 day: a strong mall, able to rougl it, and used to exposure ; he has on stout hat or cap, heavy over- coat warm under-coat, cloth vest, .shirt, and flannel under-shirt, and a mering one, perhaps, be- sides. While a delicate woman, housed most of the time, more tender of constitution and less able to resist cold, wears on her shoulders what. A sacque or shawl over a miserably thin dressy and possibly, but rarely, a jacket. And that is all; her underclothes being decolletee and leaving her nedk unprotected. What a con- trast, and what pure idiocy! Why, as Mrs. Everett said, you could run a pin its whole length into the man w-ithout itsoreacling his skin anywhere about his breast or back or shoulders, where he requires defence, but you could do nothing of that kind with a woman except at her -except where she does not need defence so much, and there it is mostly panier." "And then our stockings," she continued after a momentary pause, caused by a little confusion on her part at this point. "To think of our delib- crately putting on a compressor around the most sensitive part of our extremities, deforming the shape-but that is a small matter-impeding !  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7667-00000117"/> 234     A LIVELY SALL.  the circulation where it should be freest, causiong cold feet and all their train of ills, diseasing the blood vessels and injuring the quality of the blood itself. Why, a ligature drawn tightly around a limb will so completely prevent the flow of blood, that the limb may be amputated with safety; and yet women wear voluntary compres- sops from their infancy to their graves into which thev are hurried before their time, by the act it- self. Our boots are thin and low at best, not the stout, high-topped, boots of men; and then we make our feet colder. by keeping out the warm blood and only allowing it to dribble through the 7eins in a weak current." There was much of this most valuable conver- ation, but I had grown oblivious to everything mnt the pretty figure before me. There was a onfused sound of explanation and condemnation, jumble of the names-of the various parts of oman's dress and the human body.

Still I was engrossed in mny occupation, more pleased, artistically and aesthetically grati- fled, the more earnest Mrs. Gill became; and I might have been much longer engaged in the effort of getting her into harness, had she not either become tired of my futile efforts or dis- gusted at my manifest inattention, and suddenly changed the current of my thonghts. "There, -that is enough!"' she said impatiently. "I did not think you were so stupid before. A man ought to know how to arrange suspenders, since he has worn them  from childhood; but I see I must either fit them myself or go to Mrs. Everett, for advice." She had pulled away from me, just as I was making up my mind whether she would regard it as ill-timed if I dropped a small kiss accidentally on, the tip of one of her shoulder-blades. Her words convinced me that she would consider the act inappropriate to the occasion, but I was not yet prepared to surrender my occupation as dressing-maid, or confess that I could not fit a pair of suspenders to a pair of pretty shoul- deAs.

"Why did you not say so before?" she asked with vexation. "Above all, do I need something elastic, which will give to my motions.

They were not driven mad by nerves-as I am so often and often, when you are heartless and unkind enough to accuse me of being out of temper-be- cause their nerves were strengthened by the free- dom of motion which was possible to them, but is impossible to us. They used to sweep the rooms and make the beds and cook the meals, because they did not have to waste more strength in strugglig with their dress than in doing the work. Now I do nothing, and yet I feel so tired that I want to lie on the sofa all day and read a novel. Our grandmothers never wanted to lie on sofas and read novels."

"Just a minute"I said evasively, as though mat- ters had finally come to the point of settlement, although they were really as far off as ever. The truthful tone of my voice reassured her, and she went on: "Now what do we do?" she asked derisively, settling down into what I hoped would prove a new flow of conversation. ' We are too fine to cook our dinners or make our beds or sweep our rooms, so we go to gymnasiums and spend our time at health-lifts, and then only half cure our- selves, and are in a state of permanent half diges- tion, and swallow bottles of pancreatine and boxes of blue-pills, and every lady keeps her doctor as she does her kitchen-girl, unless she takes to homceopathy and drugs herself.--How long are you going to keep me standing here, and what are you about now, I should like to know!

"But I am afraid it may hurt you justthere," I said with the natural sympathy to be expected from a man. a Nonsense!" she replied bravely; " women are not such tender flowers. Do get through and be done with it. You will keep me here all day." My acute and experienced car still detected no tone of absolute anger in her voice as Mrs. Gill uttered these complaints, but there was no telling how much longer she would stand it, and I has- tened to complete the essential part of my work, drawing out the unnecessary finishing-touches as long as possible, and intending to give no intima- tion of its being through until I should be com- pelled to do so. I was really a little nervous, lest by some mishap her clothes should come loose and fall off in Broadway. There was not so much objection to- this in the privacy of our apartment, and two or three accidental slips had already happened to the skirts while I was occu- pied with them; but if this should occur in the street, fastened all together, as they were and de-  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7667-00000120"/> 240     A LIVE'LY SALL Y. pendent one upon another, the result might be most appalling. Beautiful as my wife's shape was, I did not care to ever assume the role of Lady Godiva amid a New York populace, who would have no reduction of taxes to hope by the display, and not enough religion to fear the fate of Peeping Tom. I shuddered to think of her walking confidently among the throngs that haunt our great thoroughfare; proud of her new apparel, enjoying the luxury of a successful accomplish- ment of her wishes, and a surreptitious conquest of male garmeits, only to be suddenly and humil- iatingly disrobed, degraded, and exposed, herself and her attire made a joke for the race of heart- less boys and merciless boothlacks of our city ; so, apart from the pleasure of my pursuit, I made all the buttons fast .and the bands secure and the buckles safe; for besides, if anything should give way, its replacement might be difficult in her inexperienced hands. She endured it well. I was seated comforta- bly in a chair before the looking-glass, with lier standing close by me, so that she could perceive the general effect of what arrangemrents I made in the mirror. I drew the suspenders across her   A LIVELY SALLY.       241 shoulders and breast, and broulght them under her arms and fastened them to buttons on her- skirts. I loosened unholy strings and bands, fit- ting in pieces of elastic, but retaining the buttons at essential points, as an extra security against accident. I was continually passing my hands about her waist and over her hips and shoulders, and turning her round, first to one side and then to another, as one has a right to do with one's own wife; slowly, very slowly drawing my work to its final termination, lingering lovingly over each adjustment, and touchinog tenderly every strap and band, watching cautiously to see just how much Mrs. Gill's temper would bear. She all the while so deep in. hygienic explanations, that she hardly noticed what mny sacrilegious hands were doing, nor where the tips of my fingers were wandering; never ceasing to instruct me in the dangers of pressure on this organ, or deflection of that rib, or constriction of the other muscle, and manifestly convinced that " all the ills that female flesh is heir to" were to be traced to tight lacing or improper dressing. She was so deeply occupied, and endured it so well, that I concluded I could presume a little: "  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7667-00000121"/> 242    -A LIVEL'Y SALLY. "My darling," I said suddenly, if an unex- pected and insurmountable difficulty lhad pre- sented itself, "we have forgotten one thing: there is still another string." "Why, no," she answered uneasily. -"No,'t]hose are all. You have them all arranged, and very nicely too, although you have been forever about it, and are the most awkward dressing-maid I ever had. You are the last man I shall have for that office., "I hope so, my dear," I replied seriously, not admitting pleasantry in a such a possible contin- gency. "But there is another string, you know, below all these," and I made a movement as if I was about to search for it; but with a quick twist, Mrs. Gill swung herself out of my hands, and danced ten feet away, turning her laughing but defiant face towards me. "Thank you very much," she said, 'but that is all." "No, it is not," I replied, with air serious to the point of lugnbriousness, for I did want to search for that string. "There is certainly another, for you must wear underneath--" "But I don't!" she screamed with a shout of   A LIVELY SALLY.      243 laughter interrupting me. "They are all in one piece, and reach from my shoulders to my knees. They are the new-fashioned things called ' breech- lettes,' because they are pantalettes and-and- all together." She blushed a charming little roseate tinge as she said this. ' Mrs. Everett: had a pattern of them, the ugliest thing you ever saw, and I made Jane cut me out a pair by it yesterday. I put them on this morning," she added triumphantly, "and they are splendid. I feel as light as a bird, and want to fly. ' I can jump, and I can run, catch the wild goat by the hair,' and swing my arms above my head. See!" And with that my usually sedate and quiet little wife began capering about the room in the maddest and absurdest fashion conceivable.

"Can- you touch- your toes with your hallds without bending your knees?" she demanded, with a fresh outhurst of laughter. "Look at me ;" and she bent over lower and lower till the points of her fingers rested on the tips of her slippers, while from the position of her skirt it was appar- ent- that her knees were straight as if she were standing erect.

"My dear," I replied as stiff as my joints, "I really have never tried, and doubt whether I should excel in such accomplishments." "Oh, you are above such trivial relaxations, are you?"Mrs. Gill retorted, with vicious disobedi- ence and a lurking glance of innocent bedevil- ment in her eye. "If you assume that tone, I will do worse. Try it; do your best. Bend ove'; down with you."  I moved not, and she stood looking at me with mocking merriment.

That as they have in woman's most intimate article of apparel managed to combine the male and female habiliment, they may not in time confound the male and female sense of pro. priety, and make women as bold nmen.  Cer- tainly dress must have some moral influence, some quality capable of hereditary transmission, for looking at Sall now one can see the result in her very appearance; her figure confesses it. She is exactly the same size of breadth, depth, and thick- ness from her shoulders to her waist, and has no pore shape than a  breechlette itself.

"         -     ,   S     l,   A LIVELY SALLY.       249- It was several months after these sage reflec- tions had presented themselves to my mind, that Mrs. Gill invited me to inspect a new toilette she had been preparing, a few new dresses which she said she had been getting made, as of course she had purchased none for some time previous, and was entirely without anything decent to wear. "You know those dresses at Stewart's," she said, as the dressing-maid was giving some final touches to the arrangement of the first attire she wished to display to my critical judgment; "those thou- sand-dollar and two thousand-dollar affairs,-and one, I believe, for three thousand dollars? I wonder who buys them." "Nobody," I responded with the decision of a terror-stricken husband in mortal fear for the safety of his pocket. C They are shams and shows, like the big cigars in front of- tobacco-stores. They are Stewart's signs, and mean ' Fine dresses sold here; X Here is the spot where good dresses are got,' or ' The friends of fine dresses meet here.'

"Yes,' she: said with momentary reluctance, and then again she launched into praise of its sim- plicity, although that, to my eye, with its flounces and puffs and pleating, and what not,. was the last quality I should have selected- for notice. But I was struck with the peculiarly advanta- geous way in- which it displayed the neatniess of my wifes trim figure, a subject- to which I re-- turned as. often as my wife led' me away from it. "You ought never to0 have a dress fitted b-yI any other dressmaker, so few can fit your fbirin toV such perfection," I said at last.  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7667-00000126"/> 252-     A L LIVELY SALL Y. Instead of being pleased, Mrs. Gill seemed rather provoked, and impatiently called upon the maid to take off that dress and put on an- other. I retired while the transformatiorn was effected, and on my return was ratlher surprised at the change. Certainly simplicity was not the ruling quality of this new garment. It was bril- liant and gorgeous to an extent which almost- blinded me.  I merely stood and stared at it. It was a silk, but of a light sky-blue trimmed with red, 'eked out, covered, and emblazoped with such a mass of bows and frills, flounces, knots, pleats, foldsj and all manner of orna- ments, additions, and extentions, the names of which were wholly beyond my acquaintance, that I could make nothing of it. Delighted at my confusion, Mrs. Gill marched up and down be- fore the mirror, swinging her long train of daz- zl'ng hues around at every turn, and skilfully spreading it out behind her as she walked, with an artistic and deft kick of her heel. As she thus displayed its wonderful attractions she would gaze admiringly back at it over her shoulder, while with iLocking demureness she would ask   A - LIVEL Y SALL . -   2538 men "How is that for a train?" and if I did not think it "nice." "Heavens!"I exclaimed as soon as I recovered from my bewilderment sufficiently to speak. "You are surely not going to wear such a thing as that!" ("Why not?" she asked shortly. " Why, it is a coat of many colors; a variety show, like a clown's motley." "If you do not like it, Mr. Gill, say so; but say so in respectful language, and do not compare me to a clown, if you please," said my fair wife ternly. Thus recalled to myself, I remembered my golden rule of household government. More ver, the dress was bought and paid for. and might as well be worn as left to rot and mildew in idce- ness. So I tried to find what I could to admire about it. "It suits your figure," I managed to stammer out in dreary repetition, but was caught up promptly by my precise wife. "Good gracious! Mr. Gill. Do try to find something new to say.

Oh, such figures, and how the corset fitted, hqw perfectly it'was adapted to the shape, and how it grew and grew in your very presence, becoming more and more beautiful every moment! I lin- gered in front of that magnificent machine. It fascinated me, and though I tore mnyself away, it drew me continually back. Again and again I found myself close to it while you wanted to rush away to the machinery department, or study agricultural puzzles which they called implements,  or smell show-apples which looked like wax, and which I believe were wax, as no one was allowed to touch them, and the policeman guarded them as though they had been just imported from the Hesperides. I struggled my best to escape A the attractions of those beautiful corsets; I fled   A LIVEL Y SALLY.      257 and hid behind show-cases, and dissipated my mind by light explorations of refrigerators, or gay and giddy examinations of new stoves, each with a candle inside, to make a suggestion of firp and warmth. But that beautiful machine gave me no peace; it towered above the other articles. I caught glimpses of it from all parts of the hall; at odd times I came upon unexpected and distant views of it? till I could think of nothing else, and was always watelling for it. Ironmongery was no defence; patent beds gave me no rest; wax apples had lost their flavor; agricultnral com- plexities no longer bewildered me. I My soul was possessed of one object, and one alone. And it was going steadily on with its satanic work, weav- ing and weaving and weaving the white thread into the elegant corset. Things began to lose their individuality; nets of thread seemed spread about me like spiderwebs, fillns of gossamer floated before and enveloped stoves and ranges and refrigerators. I seemed to be looking through a veil of thread and saw a corset in every ex- hibited article. If I opened a refrigerator, a corset like a skeleton ghost fled away from the farther corner. If I looked at a book-case, there  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7667-00000129"/> 2s5     A LIDVEI YILr:. was a corset lying on the upper shelf just appear- ing over the edge. Corsets danced like demorins in the sham fires of the stoves, or acted as wires to hold up the show chandeliers." Mrs. Gill paused fol breath as in her excited and fluent way she drew this picture, but only for a moment; then she resumedd: "I fought bravely. My virtue was Roman; and had you stood by me, your wife woulld have been thetrue woman of whom you were once justly proud. But yon deserted me; you basely left me alone in my hour of greatest peril. You pretended to be tired of stoves, refrigerators, patent bed-bot- toms, chandeliers, china-ware, and sky-colored mantle-pieces; you tried to drag me into the machinery department, though you knew I hate steam-engines and wheels and plumps and saws and all manner of noisy and greasy machines that revolve and twist and bob and jump and roll ahd turn and slide, as if they were mad or drunk. I can't endure the noise. and I am arid of the bands, for I read of, a girl who was cauglit by her back hair and carried a hundred times a min- ute round a wlheel or a pulley, or somethinpg of that sort, and.

But in spite of all this, you would go; and left me,--actually left me alone in the same room with that irresistible corset-weaver, in its power and hopelessly involved in its toils. Hardly had you gone: before I fled back to its side; I saw it weave and weave the beautiful things. I loved them;: I longed for them; I sur- rendered my whole being to them. I broke my resolutions, and I cast away honor; I sacrificed health; I surrendered principle, and I tossed over- board hygiene; and now they have me in their fell embrace. They press my floating ribs, they crush my liver and stop my digestion and disar- range my diaphragm  and destroy my lungs and prevent my breathing.  They bind me, hamper me, and hold me; but, cruel as they are, I love them still; and if they do bring me to an early grave, I shall wear one in it.

At this point, however, she suddenly dropped her bantering tone and became serious. "After all, I believe those hygienic women had better study a 'theory a little deeper before they 'commit themselves so absolutely to it. I doubt if corsets are unhealthy after all. I have been another woman since I have returned to their use. Why, when I left them off, I was weak and uncimfortable, and felt tired, and nmy clothes dragged on me; now. I am supported, my back is strengthened, and my sense of weakness has disappeared. Who could ever commit the folly of hanging skirts from   the shoulders?  They break one's back, while the hips are simply meant for it; and    the corsets hold theml up beautifully, and distribute the strain and pre- vent the    strings from   cutting.  No  part of woman's dress is so necessary as a corset that fits like a glove. It .is all very well for you strong men, with your broad backs and      your stout muscles, to suspend your clothes from your shoulders; and yet sailors, who need freedom of motion in climbing ropes and masts, always strap theirs about their bodies; but we  women, with   A LIVEL Y SALL Y.     261 our slim, delicate waists and small shoulders, would be committing suicide to overtask the muscles of our backs and sides. No, no; corsets are woman's main comfort, say what you will. I can speak from experience, and you, Mr. Gill, can only go on theory." At this point it began to dawn upon me that I might be regarded as the partisan of the corset- slayers; that I might be set up to be over- '-whelmed with a torrent of argument, and might suddenly be converted into the representative "tyrant man," and made to do penance for my entire sex. So I hastened to change the subject. The maid had brought out an array of dresses during this colloquy, and spread them about on chairs and sofas, in order to display them to the highest advantage.  Such dresses the demure and respectable Mrs. Gill had never worn be- fore. They were concentrated  sunlight. The spectrum analysis had been converted into silks and satins. The prismatic rays had been cap- tured and solidified. Strewn about as they were, they looked like a kaleidoscope; and every step I took, I had some new and dazzling combi-    :] nation of colors whichh almost  blinded me.     . -: 5'{  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7667-00000131"/> B6l     A LIVELY SALL Y. There was a green dress with scarlet trimmings,  a yellow dress with a blue over-skirt, while browns and reds and crimsons danced and glim- mered and shone in wonderful and startling combinations. "Good Heavens! ]Mrs. Gill," I exclaimed, when my eyes and mind took in this magnifi- cence and richness, "Fhat does this mean? What are you going to do with these extravagant monstrosities? Such incongruous and unnatural association of hues and tints is fitted for no place on earth but the stage."  I spoke warmly; I could not help it. Man is mortal, even the model husband of one wife. No one has his feelings always under comnand, and my pocket groaned at the spectacle before me. Mrs. Gill for an instant seemed offended; then a satirical little laugh rippled from her, tongue, and she replied: ' You have hit it. I did not think you were so shrewd before, Mr. Gill, but association with me has developed your intellect, and you have guessed it. I AM GOING ON THE STAGE! I shuddered so visibly that Mrs. Gill must have remarked it. She resumed:   A LIVtELY BALLY.   '   6:3 "Tlhat is, I am preparing to go on the stage.

"Not reputable I "Mrs. Gill replied contemp- tuously; "not reputable! I suppose you would have me go out to service! Do menial work; put up with the airs of an ignorant woman who calls herself a lady, because her husband made money as a shoddy contractor, or a petroleum well- digger, or a California nugget-hunter; a woman who does not know her own mind half an hour at a time, and imagines that vulgar insolence is JhIigh breeding.

By this time I was pretty well stunned and    , confounded. I made no further attempt at argu- ment or protest. I wanted to tear out a few hand- fuls of iny hair, or knock my head against the wall, or do a short mad-scene on my own account, but I was hardly equal to the exertion; Mrs.  Gill's energy seemed to have exhausted andanni- hilated all my own. 19 i  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7667-00000133"/> 266 'A LIYVELY BALL Y., "Then I shall write my own plays," she con- tinued. " I will appear in characters of my own creation, written expressly for myself by myself. I have the plot of my first drama arranged now. I will tell you about it. This is the way it is: There is an innocent, simple-minded girl who falls in love. She is pure-hearted as an angel, but is an enthusiast; wishes to do good; to make every one happy, to abolish sorrow; to help the wretched. Well, she fals in love. She is fresh from school-; she has all the hallowed incense of the school- room about her; its childish pleasures; its inexper- ience of the world; its^ignorance of evil; its desire to be something or do sqmething; its aspiration after the great anid noble. She is possessed of all these qualities, and shows it in every act and word-. Then she falls in love.   The first scene will introduce her to the audience, and make them    know her and like her; for eveJrything in writing a drama is to arouse tlhe sympathy of the audience.    So I-I mean she-will wear a   poor, shabby dress. That is only in the first scene, yout know.     She is to be doing some act of charity, visiting  some   pauper or rogue who is sick or tired, or don't want to work, oi a drunkard who  A LIVELY  ALLY.     267  won't reform, orsomething of fhat sort. As soon  as the audience are thoroughly interested, then she is to fall in love. And then--well I have  not quite arranged the rest.

"But, my dear," I inquired, ( since you have left off corsets, how about thoseo--those-.-  "Those what?" she asked, reduced to sudden demureness. "Those things you wore underneath?"I per- sisted. "Women's dresses are not things, Mr.. Gill," she answered evasively; "they have names. I wear many 'things underneath,' as you call it. You must learnaccuracy of language, if you wish to be understood." '"Those-those-I think you called them' trou-. serlettes,' or something of that sort," I replied. "11 those," she answered, with an assumed air of deep consideration; then added with vivacity: "Those horrid, ugly things! those ridiculous, com- mon, vulgar, gross affairs! Me wear them!

Were she to make the attempt, a crown of- success would await her; but she has confined her mind to the home- , circle, and given to Dick, Moll, and Sail what was meant for mankind. She had broken out on this occasion in a most unusual way; long restraint had been too much for her, and she rebounded to the other extreme, Breechlettes and shoulder-straps and plain robes and ugly under-garments had       , overwhelmed her. It was only natural that she      : should relax by a short dissipation, a bath in the colors of the rainbow.

THE SMATLL UWKNOWN. "The woman tempted him, and he did eat." I OCCASIONALLY fall into temiporary lapses of abstraction, not deep nor serious ones, but suffi- cient to withdraw my attention from what is pass- ing around me for a few minutes.  These often occur when I am  walking in the street, and I have the mortification of seeing some one bow to me after it is too late to respond; I know that I have perhaps passed my best friend, or some- extremely sensitive acquaintance, or a gen- tleman to whom I am, or wish to be, under obliga- tions, and that, in -not replying to his salutation, I have brought upon myself coolness, ill-will, or the reputation of bad manners or intentionalt rudeness. These waking sleeps happen to me, however, more frequently at dinner, and I will find myself eating what I happen to have taken on my plate, without being aware of what it is, my   mind so engrossed with some other subject   of consideration, that, if I were asked suddenly, I could not tell whether it were "fish, flesh, fowl, or good red herring.." As Mrs. Gill is extremely fluent, and converses so charmingly that she needs little response to keep up the flow of her ideas, this abstraction often passes unnoticed by her, and it is just pos- sible that it may have been somewhat strength- ened by her remarkable command of language. I was thus on one occasion abstracted from or- dinary events, and mechanically busy with my dinner, while my mind was away on an excursion, of its own, like a, disembodied spirit. roaming through space, when I was aroused and recalled to myself by a remark of Mrs. Gill which seemed not wholly to accord with the fitness of place or circumstance. "Oh how delicious that is!" she utteredloudly, with an air and tone of intense ecstasy. How ' perfectly exquisite!" she repeated, with increasing enjoyment. ' Was there ever anything so delight- ful? My attention was thoroughly aroused by this : time,.and called to what my wife was praising in such extravagant terms. She was eating an ordi- &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7667-00000136"/> 272    TS SM2 BNALL UKiVO WY. nary piece of beefsteak, not by any means partic- nllarly tender, jucy, or well flavored; I looked at her inquiringly to make sure that my cars had not deceived me, and that I was not still in the world of dreams. But Mrs. Gill, rapturously rolling up her eyes, and turning her face toward the ceiling, repeated: "Charming! charming! I nevertasted anything like it in my life. It is absolutely perfect!" "M'y dear, what are you talking about?"I asked, glancing confusedly around, and wondering  if my wife referred to anything which I had not noticed, either on the table or about the room. "This piece of meat," she answered, still main- taining her expression of perfect happiness, and fairly gloating over the morsel she was chew- ing. "Really," I replied pettishy--for the meat was tough and stringy, and had-met the strongest dis- approval of my palate and teeth--"yon have strange taste; a worse piece of beefsteak I have rarely eaten, if I am any judge."

I cannot perceive .what you find to go ifto such raptures about."' "You must not say so, even if you think so,?" responded Mrs. Gill, still only half out of the roseate clouds of her imagination. "Certainly, my dear, politeness would forbid any such expression of dissatisfaction, llad you not commenced praising the beef in a-way wlich, I think, it is very far from deserving."' "Never mind politeness,'" answered Mrs. Gill with directness, " but on account of your digestion. was at a lecture by Mrs. Walter C. Lyman to- day, and she said that in eating you must always try to please the gustatory- nerve. She approves of enjoying good dinners." At this point, my wife again relapsed into her former condition of misplaced enthusiasm, :and resumed her 'half-aside self-conversation: "CHow delicious! how juicy and tendert I I am trying to I 12*  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7667-00000137"/> '274    THEE SMALL UZNKNOWN. please my gustatory nerve now. The steak is horribly tough, I know, and consequently the more reason that I must convince myself that it is delicious. She says that food will never nour- ish the body, unless it is eaten with pleasure, and that bad or indifferent dinners cause more indi- ,gestion by the feeling of dissatisfaction, and con- sequent depressing effect on the nerves, than by weakness of the stomach. No one knows better than I, the effect of nervous excitement in diges- tion. When my mind is at rest, I can eat and drink, and sleep afterward with perfect comfort; but if I am worried or troubled, I gurgle and gasp and start and toss all night long. Even a sudden shock, 'Mrs. Lyihan ays, will produce stricture of the glottis anid prevent deglutition; just like the other day, when you threw that cup ot hot tea all over me, I could not eat another mouthful; I had an attack of indigestion which lasted' a week.

'-Strange way of upsetting a cup, which made   THE SMALL UN'KNO WN.     275 the tea fly across the entire table and burn me,- for it did blister my skin in spots.

"But, my darling, I did apologize." "Mr. Gill! how can you say so? You did noth- ing of the sortI /and now you are making rude- ness and foul language worse by falsehood. You have never apologized. All you did was to defend yourself with the same absurd assertion, that it was an accident, when any one could see that the whole thing was intentional, and the result of your vile temper.' "Then I meant to ask your pardon," I replied submissively--for Mrs. Gill's gentle temper was giving way rapidly--" and do so now."

' I expressed the deepest contrition for my wrong, knowing that although the occurrence itself was purely accidental, I had at the time allowed certain improper expressions to escape my lips. Gradually Mrs. Gill's mind was di-   ? verted from the unfortunate event, and 'brought' back to the subject of her gustatory enjoy.  ment.  ' I was saying, when you interrupted me by the renewal of a matter which I should think  you would be willing to leave alone, that Mrs. Lyman insists that the matter of the first impor- I tance in healthful dining, is to eat with a sense of gratification. As for me, enjoyment depends a good deal upon what I have for dinner. I al-  ways eat with gratification when we :dine at Del- mdnico's; there seems to be, something about Delmonico's which makes things better, although I am in abject terror of the French head-waiter, and put the pieces in my mouth surreptitiously lest he may not approve of the way I handle my knife and fork.

Composed of what "  I asked, somewhat startled at Mrs. Gill's excited manner and strong expression. "Composed of what, did you say!" "Don't you know that the air is composed of moleculae " she asked by way of answer. "Perhaps you call them molecules; I always did whenever I used the word, but she terms them moleculke, and I suppose she is right. They are floating about everywhere; you can see them in myriads in a ray of sunlight across a dark room; they go down our, throats, and enter our lungs, and get into our food, and cover our skin, and, penetrate our pores, and float in our blood. Every time- we breathe we take thousands of them into the respiration, and bring them into direct contact with the vital fluid. It is these which create -epidemics, and cause contagions   4 diseases.  When a room is shut up, they in- crease and augment and multiply until the place is full of them. They not only carry disease, but breed it; and yet you would keep your own children locked up all the day long in such a fatal atmosphere! Mr. Gill, I suppose *   -2'itS SMA rL UNKNO WN.    279  you believe they are your own .children, although you act as if you did not." . "My darling," I remonstrated, "what a re- mark!" "Really your conduct calls for it. To confine poor little innocent children, no matter whoso, in the foul, fetid- air of the same apartment day after day, and week after week-" "But they certainly go oat. They are contin- ually inl the streets"I replied. "The streets!" she answered disdainfully. "As- if the streets of a great city were not quite as bad; almost as full of moleculae, and of a much more poisonous nature; moleculsc bred in the sltns; coming from  every tenement-house; wafted from every hole of neglect, ignorance, and filth, laden with fever and pestilence. If we could see the atmosphere we breathe, Mrs. Lyman says, we should be overcome with horror. Sitting here as we are in this room, and eating our dinner--although I am sure you have taken away all my appetite, and I do not care totouch another morsel-we are steeped, literally steeped to the lips, in foul vapors and floating poisons.

Then upon that the lighter vapors, the exhalations of our :bodies, the warm, insensible perspiration :issuing from  persons often rotten with ccorruption, forming a mass of          incipient putrefaction or streaks of deadly-dis- ease, and moving about with every motion of the  e air. Above these, but mingling with them, ris- ing to the ceiling and filling every corner of the room are the moleeulce, the atoms of all sorts of matter which are given off from  all created things like the scent from perfumes; some of     X these are not unwholesome, but for the most part  +x they are the seeds of suffering, disease, and death. WE ARE SWALLOWING THEM BY MTTmTONS NOW." This terrible picture, drawn with all Mrs. Gill's vigor of manner, force of action, and expressive- ness of feature, made me shudder. Laying down my knife and fork, I furtively glanced around    ! the room  to see if I could distinguish the fell malaria or the fatal moleculca.  I trembled at the secret presence of so dreadful a foe. There was nothing  to be  distinguished; the carpet Of         t .   .'         )E!

I was unable to proceed with my dinner, and waited in silent terror for what Mrs. Gill might say next. I was glad to perceive that she was not so much affected, but went on eating with undiminished appetite. "We have often noticed the oppression -and sleepiness which almost overpowers us at thea- tres and lectures," she continued. "Possibly, my dear, the character of the enter- tainment had something to do with that," I inter- polated ; but she paid no heed to the remark, and went on: "This is largely due to carbonic acid gas, but still the noleculas are abundant. In every such assemblage there must be one, and there are often dozens of persons, affected by some secret -dis- ease. That individual gives off particles of him- self through the action of the lungs or the slin ; he surrounds himself with an atmosphere laden with the evil from which he is suffering.

Imagine our swallowing the foul emanations of all the unhealthy bodies thus brought together; of our taking the fetid exudation into our very mouths and throats and lungs, bringing it in contact with our blood, and laying our vital organs open to its attacks. There was that fat man who sat directly in front of us at Steinway Hall, the other night, when we went to hear Grace Greenwood and Mrs. Ames lecture. Steinway'Hall is the worst ventilated public building in the city, in my opinion, and I must have swallowed pounds upon pounds of that fat man.  I felt that I was taking him in at every breath.  I shut my month and respired through my nose, as I always do in the street when passing any unwholesome neighblorood. In that way the air is purified by being filtered I through the nasal passages, which strain out many impurities. Still I could not avoid swallowing great draughts of him. I felt his adipose tissue slipping down  my throat at every inhalation: ; He was so fat and greasy, and perspired in the hot air till drops of water stood all over his face and neck.  Ugh! I taste him now. I shall never  get his flavor out of my mouth.

They rise up in myriads whenever we step on the carpet; they hang in the curtains, and hide among the dust. People ought never to open their mouths, but breathe through their noses, and so keep them out in a measure. Could'we see these mo- leculae, were they so colored as to be visible lo the eye, and could we distinguish the atoms of other persons which we swallow, and understand of what decayed matter they were composed, we should turn sick at the very idea."' "My dear," I remonstrated, finding that the effect imagined as possible by Mrs. Gill was be- ginning to threaten myself, -" may I beg you to change the subject? I am afraid I shall not en- joy my dinner." "I am surprised, Mr. Gill, that a mere scien- tific discussion of a matter so important to un- derstand should affect your nerves," said my wife, with a calm indifference so contrasted to the force of her-words that I was quite surprised. "But if you wish the subject changed, you shall begratified.

Indeed, Mrs. Lyman was particular to say that too much conversation interfered with the proper enjoyment of the taste. That, however, is a matter of little importance to us, as you never seem to have anything to say, and I do not talk much, only referring to those matters which are absolutely essential to our health or comfort. But if you would rather I should hold my tongue altogether, I will do so." Mrs. Gill knows perfectly well that nothing gives me more pleasure than to listen to her con- versation; without her entertaining observations my meals would entirely fail to come up to Mrs. Lyman's standard. But she wanted me to renew my assurances of that fact, which I proceeded to do instantly and to her entire satisfaction. "Well," she replied when she was placated, "if you like to hear me, I should not think any subject I wished to talk about would disgust you so that you could not eat your dinner; :and I should like to ask you whether moleculas  is right, instead of molecule. But if it makes you feel sick, you needn't answer." "My dear," I responded, glad of ;a chance to exhibit a little vain learning, and ;somewhat A,   TEBE SHA LL 'JUNKgNO WN.   285 irritated at the -sanitary treatment I had just re- \ ceived, "there is no such word as molecula3e in any language.

Like animalcule, it has no right to existence, except through the straining after big words of the Imeducated,' - "Mr. Gill, I cannot let you call Mrs. Lyman uneducated.

But I suppose you con- demn  Mrs. Lyman because she -is a woman. Besides, I don't believe any one knows how to use those words. For instance, why do you call Hippodrome,. Hippodrome, and not Hippodrome and yet every body sayls epitome, and not epitome, although they talk of learned tomes all the same. I never go by Barnum's that I dount think of this, and wonder how he pronounces it; for he must be: right, as he has to use the word so often,  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7667-00000143"/> 286    2/' SAL24WEL U KNOWW.   ' So if Mj[rs. Lyman wants to say m0olecuZCe, there is no reason why'she should not. I like it best, and think it sounds a great deal better than molecule. Some day I shall ask Mr. Barnum about it, if he is a humbug; I do'not care where I get my information, provided it is only trust- worthy; and he has certainly made a great suc- cess of the Hippodrome. There were so many people there when we went, that I am  deter- mined I shall never go again, at least till tile excitement is over and they are thinned onut. I hate being in a crowd, and the place is so large I could not see anything. I should be very sorry if that famous gymnast were to miss his hold of the trapeze and fall; but if he did, it would be a pity not to be where I could see it." Mrs. Gill, oppressed with these reflections, dropped into momentary silence, and when she revived, it was with a return of conversation to the first topic under consideration. "There are'two acts in swallowing," she said, her attention probably being attracted by the difficulty of mastering ari extra toug bitof steak; ' the voluntary and the involuntary.. Many of thl actions of the organs of the body necessary to sus-   TEE SA, LL UNKN O a1FN.   287 tain life, are involuntary. Were it otherwise, and were we for an instant to forget them, we might die suddenly and not knlow it. We breathe without volition; our hearts and livers and bow- els work without any interference on our parts; while on the other hand, ordinary motions are not made without the direction of the will. In the act of deglntition, the motion is compound; the food goes by volition as far as the glottis; after that, the act is involuntary. We may of our own will refuse to take the food into our mouths, or to masticate it, or to commence--the act of swallowing; up to that point all is under our control, but after that, we cannot help our- selves.  The muscles act of themselves; the food must descend  into the stomach, and calinot'be broughlt back except by a violent spasm of that -organ, caused by an emetic, and entirely inde- ,pendent of our will. To encourage persons-to the voluntary act of mastication and  prelimr inary swallowing, we must gratify their gusta-'- tory nerves; the r/ire  those are pleased, the A-  imore will be eaten voluntarily, and the better will it be digested.

'"Mr. Gill," she replied firmly, " you certainly said the beef was tough, tasteless, stringy, and badly cooked. I do not know what else could be   said against any meat.

Do it yourself, Mr. Gill, if you desire; you shall have leave with all my heart."' "Dearest, you are the best housekeeper in the- world," I answered, always appalled,. as she is well aware, at this prospect. "You know I think so, and that I could not do half so well." "Then I don't understand why you grumble at your dinners. The meat may be poor, but there are string-beans, tomatoes, asparagus, pota- toes, and corn: enough for a reasonable person; but we will have more to morrow, if you are not content."' "I assure you I am entirely satisfied; I never enjoy a grand formal dinner half as much as our cosey little home entertainments, where every- thing is well chosen and well cooked, and where I have you wholly to myself."  This answer of mine may seem a little inconsistent; but my fellow-married-men will understand it. Mrs. Gill was mollified, and proceeded. "Well, I was about saying, if we found noth- 38      I   &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7667-00000145"/> 290    THE RSfATT UNKNxoWN. ing but dry bread on the tQ le when we sat down, hungry as wenight be, w o, equld not eat- It would be impossible for us to make a decent, not to say a satisfactory dinner under such cir- cumstances. How can we expect children to feel differently. Everybody, child or grown person, wants an enj:yable dinner if 1e would keep in health; and Mrs. Lyman is right, that bad cooking is no inducement to health of body or mind. A Frenchman cut the gustatory nerve from the throat of a living dog, which thereupon refused to eat, not seeming to care for any species of food, and died of starvation. Frenchmen are always doing such queer things, and I do not think I should care to eat, if somebody had cut my throat." Mrs. Gill at this point settled down into mo- mentary silence, and I proceeded with my dinner as usual; but doubtless her busy mind was as hard at work as ever, for in a minute she broke out again suddenly. "Do you know the difference between dysqn- tery and diarrhoea " she asked abruptly.     1 I was shocked at the matter -and time of the  - question, and replied reprovingly:        /   THEY SMALL rUNKOWN.      291 "' My dear, I would prefer not to talk on such subjects at my meals." "Wlly not??" she asked in response. "I re- ferred merely to the symptoms and method of cure which very few people understand." "Still they are not pleasant matters to talk about," I insisted. "Diarrllcea is no worse than Dio Lewis, I am sure," she answered belligerentl looking quite surprised when I only broke into laughter at the comparison. "To judge by my recollection," was my ready confession, "they might be classed as almost one and the same thing. My stomach has a vivid recollection of his measureless mulsh." "Mush!" responded Mrs. Gill with a pat- ronizing smile. "How stupid you are.   Dio Lewis was not mush; he was beans."' "Well," I replied, "whether beans or mush, Graham meal or oatmeal, Dio Lewis and diarrhcea go naturally together, and either suggests the other by what the mnemonicians call association of ideas."5 "Then I do not see why you'should object to speaking of them," replied my wife with perfect  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7667-00000146"/> 292   , TEEBZ SALL UTNO We. seriousness, and not in the least aware of having said anything jocose. "I am sure -no one is more sensitive than myself to unpleasant suggestions. My nose is forever in the way of mny comfort; only last week I passed a man in the street who had surrounded himself with an atmosphere of his own, a wretch who was a walking and mov- ing centre of disease; who radiated corruption and foul air like a miasmatic marsh; who was rot- tenness and decay alive and perambulating the earth. He so outraged my nose and offended the sense of propriety of my olfactory organs, that I came straight home and took a bath, lath- ering myself all over an inch thick-'with disin- fectant sulphur-soap, which you know is a guar- anteed preventive against contagion, and then hardly felt safe and comfortable. To be sure I found out afterwards the man was only carrying home some Limburger-cheese but that made no difference.-I meant to mention Airs. Lyman's remnarkable specifics; but if talking of such things makes you sick, I will say no more about them, al- though it is a disease, Mr. Gill, which often attacks people of your- physique and temperament, and then is doubly dangerous.

As she drew this picture of my situation and the possi- bilities of my falling a prey to so terrible a dis- ease, I became alarmed. A certain sinking at my heart and nervousness in my epigastric re- gion confirmed her words. I had been in the habit of eating freely of whatever I wanted, and- it was highly probable that although I had as yet experienced no injurious effects, I should in the end have to suffer for it. The law of Nee England religion, in which I had always had a sneaking faith, is that all pleasures .were to be punished by after-pains, and thatr the only way to be happy was never to be otherwise than misera- ble.  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7667-00000147"/> 294    THE MALL  USTYO WN. I implored Mrs. Gill to explain to me sovaylu, able a cure which had escaped the attention of the medical fraternity, only to be discovered and promulgated by a woman.   With some reluc-' tance-for Mrs. Gill, sweet, gentle, amiable, and loving as she is, is not always submissive to re- proof-she complied. "Swallow a glass of flour and water mixed; the dough sticks to the walls of the stomach, pre- vents irritation, and allows the inflammation to heal. You know what sticky stuff dough is? Well, it adheres and makes a regular plaster over the entire coating of the stomach." "A stomachic overcoat," I suggested-; but the -lady too]k no notice of the remark. "There is only one thing more," she went on. "I should put in a little glycerille, which is inore sticky yet; or, for the matter of that, glue itself, the -same as the paper-hanger used all over our walls and called sizing. That always seemned Such a queer word, and I never knew what it meant. before, but it would be just the thing to put siz-  ing over the walls of the stomach, precisely as he . put it on the walls of our rooms.

"Oh, my dear," I remonstrated, with the re- serve of the true paterfamilias "you had better not open a correspondence with such people Public lecturers, you know, require to be pretty bold and pushing, and she might try to press such an introduction into unpleasant intimacy." "What a goose you are! I was the cavalier re- sponse. '"In the first place, Mrs. Lyman is a perfect lady, and lectures only for the benefit of the public, not for-herself; and then didn't I tell you already that she makes a point of inviting inquiries from her hearers and answering them from the platform? And now, Mr. Gill, myv gustatory nerve would like a petit verre of your old whiskey, which, you ought to remember, Dr. Mason prescribed for me every day after dinner, but which I was just waiting to see whether you would offer me.

I became a convert at once to Mrs. Lyrman's views of medical hygiene. I went into this new course of treatment with enthusiasml There was a double pleasure in it; I enjoyed it directly, and found a satisfaction in takint re- r vengeO for past deprivations.

Our gustatory nerves began to know ,how badly they had been treated, and what proper consideration was. We took most kindly to this good eating and drinking, which were to secure our physical salvation. We poured into the interstices "Pom- mery and Greno," "Due de Montebello," "Krug," "Chambertin," "Nuits," "Chateau Yquem,' and such other assistants to appetite, and conse- quently aids to health. The novelty of looking upon anything pleasant as wholesome was delight- ful of itself. It alone was a sort of truancy from school.; a delicious sensation of doing wrong; a glorious defiance of conventional goodness. To be sure, I sometimes thought I saw the sword of retribution hanging mistily over our heads, but it was charming to pretend we did not believe there was any such thing, to have excellent medi- cal authority for so saying, and to go on in de- spite of it actually making a virtue of enjoyment. For the first time in our lives had we been told that there was good in what was not disagreeable, 13*  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7667-00000149"/> 298    T. ttS SMAALL UNKNO WN. and we made the most of it. Mrs. Lyman had two devoted adherents, and I hoped the dispen- sation would never change, gout or no gout. One day at about that time, on entering the house with my latch-key, at the dinner-hour, on which I now counted with much interest, I was- startled to hear a terrible noise from the nursery: loud cries, frantic screams, and appalling yells ' issued from that part of the house with a clamor and intensity which could be heard not only down the. three pair of stairs, but out into the street. Amid the uproar, I thought I could distinguish tak cries of the children, but in an unnatural toinne arising from fearful pain or terror, while above the racket resounded the voice of Mrs. Gill, in wild ejaculations. For a moment I stood para- lyzed, a thousand fears and horrors rushing through my mind. Was the house on fire? Had one of the children met with some terrible in- jury? Had an accident occurred? One of them must surely be killed. Which was it? Dick, darling, bright-eyed, fair-haired, gentle-hearted Dick? Or Moll, sweet, loving, merry, coquettish Moll, my Brownie, my special pet? No, I could not spare[Moll. Or solemn Bill, or funny baby   THE SM A TL UNKNOWN.     299 Sail? I could not part with any one of them, nor bear the thought of any of them suffering.

But now they seemed all equally dear. The first moment of irresolution over, and I dashed upstairs, two steps at time, flinging my hat to one side, stopping for nothing, anxious to- learn the worst at once. The din increased as I ascended, till, approaching the nursery, it seemed as if it were a cell of lunatics or a cage of wild beasts. I dashed open the door and rushed in. What a sight met my eyes! The children were all there-a glance showed me that; thank Heaven!-but in what a state! There stood Mrs. Gill, at one side of the room: her nostrils -dilated; her large, luminous eyes, staring and glowing; her features contracted with an expression of intensest agony; her thick raven hair streaming in masses over her shoulders and down her back; her hands extended as if to - shut some horrible vision from her sight, while : "'  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7667-00000150"/> 300    THE SYSMA LL 'UNKNOWN. she was shrieking out discordant words, of which at first I could only catch here and there one in my excitement, but which gradually took form and meaning. The first connected sentence I made out was: And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shr-r-r-oud? And in this rage, with some great linsman's bone As with a club dash out my desperate brains?" This was followed by a terrific scream which almost froze my blood. Mrs. Gill, half wild with some unusual and incomprehensible emotion, or urged on by a strange and irresistible passion, was repeating  Romeo and Juliet in a most vividly dramatic manner. I knew how excitable she was, and trembled at a dreadful fear. Opposite her, and imitating her gestures to the best of his infantile ability, corrugating his brows into expressions as nearly-like her own as his usually placid' features would allow, stood Dick, unable to remember more than the- last few lines of the soliloquy, but repeating over and over again, with all the energy of which he was cap- able, the words: O ( dook, methinks I she my coushin's gosht 1 O' dook, methinks I she my couslin's gosbt I O dook, methinks I she my coushin's gosht It   T  IEW SMALL UNKNO WN.     301    - At the other end of the room was Moll shout- ing out in the most determined manner, but with very slight regard to expression and the supposed circumstances of its original ltterance, the begin- ning of the witches' invocation: t All hail, Machet!

Her strange ac-- tions must 'have infected the children, and led them to imitating her.

A vague idea flitted across my mind that this was partly the result of her pathological researches; that the inflictions she had imposed upon her body, the changes of diet, the different courses of treatment, thle innumerable baths, the cold pours, the hot foments, the tons of dough, the bushels of beans, the gallons of mush, the strange washes and soaps and pills and globules, the unusual studies and investigations, had at last turned her brain and left her unable to control her actions. What was I to do? Of course she must have rest.  Perfect .quiet, a total absence of   all disquieting subjects of inquiry or exciting dis- cussions, was manifestly necessary. That would be the general treatment, but for the present, how was the exaltation under which she was laboring, and which temporarily had possession of her, to be allayed ? A quick dash of cold water might - have the effect. That might startle her into sudden sanity. But there wasno pitcher in the    TEE SMALL UNKNOWN-      303     - room. Tle human eye, I knew, had a powerful effect over lunatics. It was clear that that was  - my only resource. Summoning up all my utmost sternness of gaze, I fixed my glance resolutely upon her, and never removed it for a moment. Lunatics are dangerous.   In moments of      : frenzy even delicate women acquire the strength  of giants, and can overpower the strongest men. At such times they are apt to turn on those they love best, like dogs suffeling from rabies, and wives may even attack their husbands. I knew Mrs. Gill loved me. Might she not act in the     . same way?  Following her every motion, and  assuming a bravery I was far from feeling, and contracting my forehead into a heavy froWn, I gazed at her steadily and sternly. It seemed to    i have its effect. At- first she became madder and    : madder; through all the mad passages of Juliet's  -  soliloquy before that unfortunate heroine swal- lows the potion which the friar had given her     : to cause the semblance of death, she was the maddest- of the mad.

The closing lines, uttered in a much more weakened tone, were evidently addressed to myself; "O Romeo, Romeo, this do I drirnk to thee!" With this utterance she became instantly quiet and submissive, and seating herself calmly .on the edge of Dick's bed, proceeded -in her natural. voice to answer my look and agtitude of surprise and pain. [We are practising," she said calmly. "Practising?"I broke  oat gasping, with greater dread than ever at the words. "Practis- ing insanity " "No, you goose!" she replied, "we are pray tising our lesson in elocution.. But why don't you kiss me.  You have been standing there like an owl with your eyes wide open, and ha e not kissed me yet."  Kissing a lunatic was a sure way of being bitten, I thought, and it was with more of fear than pleasure that I obeyed. But she seemed to be perfectly peaceable and composed now, and I ads  j   THE SMALL L UNKNOWN.     305 began to wonder whether the fit was over or was this only another phase of GIrs. Gill's- search after the true hygienic philosopher's stone. Cer- tainly her minner of referring to my lunatic- quelling gaze was r ot complimentary, but it also exhibited little of the terror which an insane person might -be expected to feel. She was apparently as self-possessed and sensible as ever, and every symptom of insanity had disappeared. With her ordinary promptness and fluency she proceeded at once'to explain her views, while the children gradually settled down, like echoes of a thunder-peal which had ceased to reverberate, into comparative silence. "' Mrs. Lyman has expatiated, at all her lectures, upon the benefits of elocutionary exercises in ex- panding and strengthening  the lungs. If there is one defect about me   more apparent than another, it is weakness of the lungs. That, I am fully convinced, is the reason that I talk so little. The children are sure--as I have often- explained to you before, on physiological grounds-to take after their father and mother. Although you, Mr, Gill, can shout loud enough-as I am sorry to say I have learned to my cost when  I have  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7667-00000153"/> / 306    1  83 rMATrT.

Some of them may be like their mother, and will need to have their chests strengthened. So I purchased a work on elocution, by William Rus- sell, which Mrs. Lyman recommended. I am teaching them a few passages; while, for nvself, I thought I would repeat the part of Juliet, whichb, you remember, I once tried to commit to memory when we talked of my going on the stage." I was greatly relieved at this explanation. It Silowed me that Mrs. Gill's mind was still in its normal condition, and not liable to become dis- traught. As for the danger of her ineorring lung disease, that seemed slight, so long as she could shout as I had just heard her shouting. The children, if they inherited the peculiarities of their parents, would not be apt to suffer from weakness in that direction. But it was clear that Mips. Gill was not crazy; she was merely test- ing a new system.  I felt better, and addressed myself readily to listen to her explanations.             s:   T-E SMALL UNKNO WN..     307, "I not only desired to strengthen my lungs- and chest, and, what' Ms. Lyman says is equally important, my abdominal muscles, but to edu- cate my powers of utterance.

For in- stance, how would you say, Fool! dolt! idiot that I am!" This was uttered in a most matter- of-fact fashion,- while she was still seated on the edge of the bed, in much the same voice as she would have asked me whether it was warm out. "My dear," I replied facetiously, "I should say nothing of the kind. I cannot conceive of you as a fool, dolt, or idiot; although appearances a minute ago were a good deal against you."

My attempt to comply with -Mrs. Gill's command was a wretched failure. I suc- ceeded in doing little but mumble out the words in an absurdly untragical fashion. "There!" she said triumphantly, "I thought as much! You do not even know how to prepare to utter a strong sentence. In the first place, your attitude is so bad that it would be impossible for you to speak well. H- old up your head; advance your body; lean on the forward foot; place your hlands on your hips.

I was even about to give testimony to my admiration, by impressing a kiss on her round, red lips, when the last sen- tence issued from them with a roar which fai ly made me jump back in alarm, and ended all idea of such an act. "There are several different intonations of the voice," she proceeded, with resumed placidity, to explain. "There are the effusive-orotund, the expulsive-orotund, and the explosive-orotund. This is an example of the explosive-orotund; with the 'stress ' increasing till it' vanishes' on the word 'idiot.' But I see that I must give you some preliminary exercises, Mr. Gill. I wish you would hold still and keep your hands quiet when I talk to you, and not go pawing me like a ridicu-g m lous poodle-dog.

"Now draw in!d give out your breath very fully. Deeper and stronger; deeper yet. That is better. Repeat that twenty times. Breathe the entire length of the chest and the abdomen. That will do. Now draw in a long breath, and send it out in a prolonged sound of the letter A. Take in all the breath you possibly can, and then keep up the expiration as long as possible. That is 'effusive utterance.' Now repeat that, except that the h is sounded quicker and harder, more like a cough. That is 'expulsive.' Now make a very brief, violent sound of the A, throwing all the accumulated breath into it as quickly and vigorously as possible. That is 'explosive utter- ance.' Commence once more, and do it over again."  Mrs. Gill and myself stood   opposite one another for the next half hour, repeating the exercises as prescribed. The children formed a circle around us, filling their little chests as we did ours, striving after the "grasshopper bend" as one might express it; inspiring and expiring,   'HuTE  SMA LL UNKN3O AWN.  3" whispering, shouting, or roaring h's in all man- . ner of tones and voices.

During the height of this uproar, it seemed to me that I heard a faint sound of knocking at the door. It grew louder, though still timid. I was in the midst of AMarc Antony's address to the Romans, roaring at the full stretch of my lungrs. Mrs. Gill was in the agony of de- spair of Julia, in the "H'-unchback}, when finally discovering that sile did ' love the "other man," and no mistake.

But this was only the beginning of our elocu- tionary experiences. We had daily exercises, sometimes with the children, sometimes merely for our own improvement. I got quite used to having Mrs. Gill call upon me as soon as I was out of bed in the morning, or when, half asleep, I was about to retire at night, to repeat "All hail, Macheth!" twenty times in the most explosive of orotund voices.

We wept, we railed, we laughed, we reviled, we chuckled, we were merry, ironical, or mad. We went through all stages of human passion, storm- ing the heights of pleasure and exploring the depths of agony, until no situation in life was possible, no accident of happiness or misery could have befallen us, in which we should have been unable to express our feelings with proper utterance and correct inflection.

My voice grew stronger, my throat became toughened, my lungs were capable of drinking in more and more of Heaven's oxygen, while the abdominal muscles were evidently strengthened. I had just come to a time when IX was beginning to doubt whether, after all, innumerable rich dinners and endless strong wines were the best foundations for permanent health. It seemed to me that the system did not work quite as satisfactorily as I hoped. At first it went well enough; all the morning I looked forward to my dinner, and in the eve- ning I went to bed with a happy expectation of my morning's breakfast. But after a time a change seemed to take place. Terrapin lost its flavor; canvas backs became tasteless; pate de foie g ras cloyed me; Pommery and Grano tasted little better than so much cider, and even Cham- bertin grew very like thin vinegar. After my meals there were queer sensations: dulness in the head, heaviness of the brain,-unwillingness to work, a burning sensation about the heart. I almost feared Mrs. Lyman's gustatory theory  was a mistake, when her doctrine of elocution   i #                  A.!   THE SMA L L UNKNOW      315 came to the rescue. Exercise of the lungs rem- edied any weakness of the stomach; and if my dinner oppressed me, a page of Macheth or a few passages from Damon and Pythias cured it instantly. I perceived that the system must be taken as a whole, and that the larynx must be used to enforce the palate. There were, however, several disadvantages connected with this study. Our servants left us, under the impression, as I was fully satisfied, that we were all crazy. The police came in twice to ascertain " what was the cause of the row," as they expressed it, and our next-door neighbor, who has no ear for melody nor heart for elocution, sent word that he would report us to the authorities as a disorderly house, if we did not " quiet that infernal din." These interferences reduced us somewhat in the line and extent of our studies. . We had to confine ourselves to " whispering passages," the  "tremor of age," "subdued  pathos," or "suppressed f  orce;" or, if we broke out in the "explosive," or "orotund," it had to be with "intermittent stress," unde- the fear of being hauled up  before the police-court, as disrepu-  &#xD;<pb n="316-317 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7667-00000158"/> NEW BOOKS   AND NEW EDITIONS, RECENTLY ISSUED BY G W.

A New  Edition. Among the numerous editions of the works of this greatest of Eng- lish Novelists, there has not been until now one that entirely satisfies the public demand ....     Without exception, they each have some strong distinctive objection, . . . either the shape and dimensions of the volumes are unhandy-or, the type is smll and indistinct--or, the paper is thin and poor-or, the illustrations [if they have any] are unsatisfactory-or, the binding is bad-or, the price is too high. A new edition is now, however, published by G. W. Carleton &amp; Co. of New York, which, it is believed, will, in every respect, completely satisfy the popular demand. . .. It is known as "Carleton's New   Illustrated Edition." The size and form is most convenient for holding, , .the type is entirely new, and of a clear and open character that has received the approval of the reading community in other popular works. The illustrations are by the original artists chosen by Charles Dickens himself . . . and the paper, printing, and binding are of the most attractive and substantial character. The publication of this beautiful new edition was commenced in April, 1873, and will be completed in 20 volumes-one novel each month--at the extremely reasonable price of $X.50 per volume, as fnlltwc *   I-THE PICKWICK PAPERS. 2-OLIVER TWIST. 3-DAVID COPPERFIELD. 4-GREAT EXPECTATIONS. 5--DOMBEY AND SON. 6 BAR^LBY-RUDGE. 7-NICHOLAS CNIKLEBY ^ ---OLD CURIOSITY-SHOP. 9-BLEAK HOUSep.

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS. "Mrs. Holmes' stories are universally read. Her admirers are numberless. She is in many respects without a rival in the world of fiction. Her characters are always life-like, and she makes them talk and act like human beings, subject to the same emotions, swayed by the same passions, and actuated by the same motives which are common among men and women of every day existence. Mrs. Holmes is very happy in portraying domestic life. Old and young peruse her stories with great delight, for she writes in a style that all can comprehend."-- Neco York Weekly. "Mrs. Holmes' stories are all of a domestic character, and their interest, therefore, is not so intense as if they were more highly seasoned with sensational- ism, but it is of a healthy and abiding character. Almost any rew book which her publisher might choose to announce from her pen would gel an immediate and general reading. The interest in her tales begins at once, ald is maintained to the close. Her sentiments are so sound, her sympathies so warm and ready, and her knowledge of manners, character, and the varied incidents of ordinary life is so thorough, that. she would find it difficult to write any other than an excellent tale if she were to try it'"--Boston Banner. "Mrs. Holmes is very amusing; has a quick and true sense of humor, a sympathetic tone, a perception of character, and a familiar, attractive style, pleasantly adapted to the comprehension and the taste of that large class of American readers for whom fashionable novels and ideal fantasies have no charm."--H enry T. Tuckerman. 3"A' The volumes are all handsomely printed and bound in cloth,-sold mrywhere, and sent by mail, postage free, on receipt of price [$X.5o each], by G. W.
