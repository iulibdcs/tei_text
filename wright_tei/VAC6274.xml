            <head>PREFACE</head> 
            <p>THIS volume is a simple outgrowth of the experience of ten years of my own life. In early manhood, circumstances led me into the very bosom of such scenes as are here described. Their novelty, as well as their peculiar and intrinsic interest, made a strong impression upon my mind. I was irresistibly led, from time to time, to make disjointed sketches of incidents that were to me full of curiosity and instruction. Long after my return to a very different physical and social sphere, these fragments of an era in my existence-pleasant while it was passing, and agreeable to remember-acquired a new value to my feelings. I felt an inclination to connect them together in a symmetrical shape, as a child strings its treasured beads upon a thread.</p> 
            <p>I now place it before the public,-hoping it may afford some instruction and pleasure to others; as the real life, of which it is intended to be a picture, did, in a large measure, to myself.</p> 
            <p>As to the execution of the work, the only thing which it becomes me to say is, that it has been made<pb n="iv-1" xml:id="VAC6274-00000003"/> true and faithful in its delineation of the matters with which it deals, to the best of my power.</p> 
            <p>Those familiar to the locality will perhaps recognize a single approximation to a portrait of one now too long and too far removed to be anywise affected by any allusions of the sort. In all other respects, I emphatically disown the smallest attempt at personality.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head> 
               <p>THE State of Maine, occupying the northeastern corner of the United States, and bordering on the provinces of the British Crown, is, by its position, somewhat remote from the great thoroughfares of commercial intercourse or fashionable travel. Notwithstanding the greatly increased communication between the Republic and the neighboring royal provinces, many of the inhabitants are still left in the unpretending simplicity of a social era that has generally disappeared in more central sections of the country.</p> 
               <p>Nature has stamped the surface and sea-coast of this State with a bold and rugged scenery, not less picturesque than the yet unsophisticated character of some of her inhabitants. Hitherto, no celebrated marvel of nature, or luxury of civilization, catering to the appetites of pleasure-seekers, has drawn, over her hilly roads or up her magnificent rivers, such flocks of tourists as elsewhere wander, at stated seasons, over our land. Yet in few localities would leisure find more means of pleasure, or more ample food for observation.</p> 
               <pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC6274-00000004"/> 
               <p>The natural features of the State are romantic and interesting beyond most regions not strictly Alpine; and its remoter sections abound in the rough grandeur of mountain scenery. Long granitic headlands run out from every part of the coast far into the ocean, forming, between their huge projecting masses, sheltered harbors, road bays, and the spreading estuaries of numerous streams. Beyond the beetling cliffs and shingly beaches that terminate the wild and rocky promontories, the jagged coast is belted often to seaward by islands shaggy with precipices, and nodding with dark forests of gnarled spruces, bearing, in their bent and twisted trunks and broken tops, frequent marks of their severe struggles with the ocean storms. Black and threatening ledges peer out among the waters, where the surges break incessantly, and wild sea-birds flit and scream amid the uproar of the waves and winds. Upon these shores there dwells a population appropriate to such a home,-sturdy, rough, adventurous, winning fearlessly from the ocean the supply of those moderate wants which the rough and difficult soil but scantily provides for. The white sails of fishing boats, coasting craft, and freighting vessels of larger size, enliven the inland bays and coves, or spread their wings in the offing, upon errands that taken them over every part of the inhabited globe.</p> 
               <p>The northern portion of the State lies still in unbroken forests, whose solitudes are uninterrupted, except by the hunter and the lumberman, and which bury the land, to the rivers and lakes of Canada, in the deep shadow of a primeval vegetation. Below this region is a gradually shaded belt of human life, exhibiting successively every varying degree of refinement of which civilized existence is capable, from the sturdy backwoodsman, scarcely conscious of the existence of books, newspapers, or any of the wants of advanced communities, and perfectly content to find all that he needs in the forest which is his home, down to the wealthy and luxurious dwellers in the maritime cities.</p> 
               <p>This population is spread out, from the rude log-huts nestled among the pines and beeches, through the little villages clustered around the cross-roads or the water-falls and saw-mills, down to the thriving towns and busy sea-parts. Every hour's ride changes its peculiarities with the equally changing aspects of art and nature with which it is surrounded.</p> 
               <p>Thus the traveller may start in the morning from the wooded inland hills, where the deer and the partridge, the bear and the wolf, still keep their native home, and, passing through every successive phase of civilization, sleep at night within hearing of the roar of the Atlantic, where daily reports from London and Paris feed the restless curiosity and ministers to the artificial habits of wealth and worldliness.</p> 
               <p>All along the path, from the mysterious solitudes, still wrapt in the solemn quiet of undisturbed nature, to cities neither ignorant of the forms nor innocent of the follies and vices of the highest refinement, the eye rests upon the huge hills and elevated ridges, intersected with deep and sheltered valleys, along which clear and rapid streams roll and tumble over the broken surfaces, and among which countless bright and wood-bordered lakes spread out their broad, sunny bosoms. The blue tops of distant mountains and the dark-green curtains of yet unmolested woodlands form the borders of the varied picture.</p> 
               <p>Here the sportsman may still find the moose, bear, red deer, wolf, fox, and partridge in the woods, and<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6274-00000005"/> the delicious trout in the brooks. Here the naturalist has an unexplored field of discovery, where objects of curiosity and interest will reward his search; and the mere idler will see novel and picturesque scenes of the animate and material world, to refresh his spirits and stimulate his intellect.</p> 
               <p>In the eastern section of this State, there lies, upon the little river Narraguagus, a village whose reality we will thinly disguise under the name of Merrifield. At the present time, the neat dwellings of nearly three thousand inhabitants extend, for a mile or more, on either side of the stream. But, at the time occupied by our story, in the latter part of the last century, it was a rude hamlet, but just redeemed from the closely surrounding forest.</p> 
               <p>The enterprise of the early settlers of Massachusetts soon explored the extended coast of the then dependent Province of Maine, and made settlements, both temporary and permanent, in favorable situations within its borders. But the disputes as to proprietorship among the English themselves, combined with its remoteness from the Bay Colony and the vicinity of enemies or doubtful friends, rendered the increase of population slow. Especially did these circumstances retard the settlement of the country east of the Penobscot River, to the sovereignty of which France long maintained pretensions. At the date of the Revolution, the English establishments in this quarter were insignificant and recent. Here and there a straggling village-Merrifield among the rest-began to displace the wilderness, where some peculiar facilities for fishing or lumbering invited immigration. The roads between these infant settlements were mere paths through the forest. Even now they are confined, in the eastern district, within a zone of twenty or thirty miles from the sea-board. These little communities were very much isolated from the rest of the world, their chief intercourse with which was maintained by trading voyages of small coasting craft. The forest, with its indigenous inhabitants, pressed closely around them. The remnants of the native tribes still roamed in the woods; and straggling parties of Canadian Indians occasionally prolonged the open hostilities of an earlier day, by stealthy incursions for petty plundering. The security and comforts of advanced stages of society were yet imperfectly known; they were, indeed, scarcely through of by a population which had very little practical knowledge of their advantages.</p> 
               <p>This little village of Merrifield was possessed of one of those vagabond characters not uncommon in new places, where society is composed of odds and ends of all sorts, not yet consolidated into symmetrical order-a sort of human waif, owning nothing and belonging to nobody, half-way between a public nuisance and a public necessity. Sam Shirk was as familiar as daylight to all Merrifield; and there was no person or thing in the village that was not equally well known to him.</p> 
               <p>His father had been killed by the fall of a tree in the "logging swamp," and left his well-disposed, but weak-minted widow to get along in the world as she could, with her orphaned boy. The rough but cordial pity of the neighbors supplied her, from their rude abundance, with food sufficient; and she did what she could, in a place where everybody did their own work, to find clothing and other comforts for herself and child. A bushel of potatoes or corn was seldom grudged to the mute eloquence of her pale and disconsolate<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6274-00000006"/> consolate face by most of the villagers, who, though not burdened with superfluities, had an abundance of such articles as they professed to have at all. Yet there were many gaps, in the economy of the little household, that were hard for the lone woman to fill. What activity and energy nature had bestowed upon her, were insufficient for the cheerless struggle of a broken life. The poor mother gradually wore out, in the anxious but feeble endeavor to cope with the difficulties that crushed her yielding spirit. Her neighbors buried her decently; and the often repeated remark, that "Miss Shirk hadn't much sprawl, and wasn't good for nothing at all, after her husband died," epitomized the history of her sad and humble existence.</p> 
               <p>So little Sam was left, at ten years old, alone in the world, for his parents had immigrated from a distant place, and what relatives they might have had, lost all knowledge, if not all memory, of them and their fortunes. The luckless child inherited from his parents, then, nothing but some of their personal peculiarities; and this ancestral property was not in itself very valuable. The active industry and shrewd but uncultivated capacity of his father were diluted, by the feeble indolence of his other progenitor, into an aimless and unproductive restlessness, which, though not precisely laziness, never developed into industry, and, though always ready for any desultory and impulsive exertion, was decidedly repugnant to any systematic labor. This unfortunate trait probably prevented the urchin from obtaining any permanent foothold in some charitable household, where wholesome discipline might have shaped his ill-sorted faculties into practical usefulness.</p> 
               <p>As it was, he wandered about the little circle of the neighborhood,-now here, now there, and sometimes apparently either everywhere or nowhere, it was hard to say which. He grew up, of course, in all manner of unprofitable oddities, as human beings must that grow wild and uncared for.</p> 
               <p>Without a particle of learning,-for, in his helplessness, necessity had taught him to scorn all superfluities,-the boy became a thorough-going and practical stoic, a genuine follower of Zeno. The sage inquiry of the old philosopher-"Cui bono?"-was always upon his lips; not, indeed, in Latin, but as Sam was wont to phrase it,-"What's the use?" This was his unfailing answer to all reproach, and the all-sufficient reply to remonstrance or advice. To live, was all he asked of the world; and he gave in return just what he asked,-nothing at all, or thereabouts.</p> 
               <p>In fact, for most useful purposes, Sam was a cipher: he stood at zero in the social scale. And yet, like other things in this well-ordered world, he did not live for nothing. He did a thousand insignificant things, that nobody else could or would do; and he kept the neighborhood in good humor by a genial slang and ready wit, that gushed spontaneously from his untaxed and vagrant readiness, as brilliant, though perhaps coarse weeds sprout from a strong and neglected soil.</p> 
               <p>His tongue seemed to have taken upon contract all the work and responsibilities of his other members, and was as active as the rest were slothful. If it did not in fact do their labor, it stood ready at least with a quaint apology for its not being done.</p> 
               <p>If good for little or nothing himself, Shirk was an all-pervading bond of union to his own little world. He found out everybody's business, and told it to their neighbors. He knew every nook in the village, and<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6274-00000007"/> spied out all the small gossip that was afloat. Thus he served pretty much the purposes of a daily newspaper; and in the absence of any competition in this line, his services were invaluable. If he sometimes set people by the ears with his tattle, he still oftener prevented or cured dissension by his absurd and humorous mediations; so that he had, on the whole, one decided advantage over modern journalism, which is not apt to sacrifice piquancy to charity or prudence.</p> 
               <p>Compelled, like a rat or any other parasite of civilization, to live upon society as he best could, he would patiently live on nothing, when there was nothing to be had; and when, by good luck, he got into comfortable quarters, he furnished his interior plentifully, and drew upon his deposits until Providence sent him a fresh supply.</p> 
               <p>But among these simple but comfortable homesteads there was always food to spare for chance necessities; and, if nature had furnished him with clothing gratis, Sam would have been-to use his own expression-"as independent as a musk-rat." But here was a trying point. Clothes would wear out; and when they fairly dropped off, he was compelled, of sheer necessity, to achieve the acquisition of a new garment. In alleviation, however, of this unfortunate consequence of the loss of man's primeval innocence, he had an astonishing gift of contentment. He could wear his winter jacket till midsummer,-its gradual dilapidation adapting itself pretty regularly to the advancing temperature of the weather,-and, when its last remnant deserted him, would appear in some new summer grab, that he had contrived to beg, borrow, or buy. This served the turn till time and winter again compelled him, like a snake, with pain and trouble, to cast off his skin and provide himself with a new one. His grab could always boast a picturesqueness that relieved it from the reproach of stiffness, so often cast upon the fashion of modern masculine attire. He generally wore coast and pantaloons of grotesque and inconsistent proportions,-adapted to his chances of buying or begging more than to his person; and his costume was commonly completed by hat or cap, shoes or boots, that looked as if they had made the tour of the world, and brought back some mark of wear and tear or acquired peculiarity from every country they had visited.</p> 
               <p>Yet, through all this vagabond life and pinched existence, poor Sam kept up a warm and light heart and an honest one. His moral deductions could hardly be expected to be of the most rigid or enlightened order. Yet no temptation could have been successfully offered, even to his utter destitution, to commit an act that he felt to be dishonest or mean. In all his poverty of social consideration, he had the confidence and good-will and a certain kind of respect of all who knew him; and he deserved it; for want had neither soured nor corrupted him.</p> 
               <p>Such was Sam Shirk, when he had attained in this disjointed fashion his early manhood; and his occupation was to do as nearly nothing as could well be contrived. He sat about mostly in the sun, or by the stoves in the little shops, and made small carts, windmills, or wooden swords for the children; sometimes getting an equivalent in gingerbread, but equally ready to minister to their demands, with or without reward. In this line of business he was unrivaled. He could whittle down a lath quicker, smooth tip a bat neater, and make a chip boat better than any man in all "Down-east."</p> 
               <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6274-00000008"/> 
               <p>Sam was one day tempted, in order to compass the purchase of a new knife, which he especially coveted, to do a little work with a barrow for the shop-keeper who had it for sale. After trundling backward and forward for some time, he began to tire somewhat of his job. But he was a man of his word, and never balked a fair bargain. So, compromising between conscience and weakness of the flesh, he seated himself in the shade of the store-for it was warm weather-to indulge in some faint regrets of his rash ambition and refresh his heated body. His barrow, meanwhile, was left in the middle of the track, for it could hardly be called a road. It so happened that, while he was thus taking his ease, old Deacon Butler's widow came along that way on horseback,-the most usual and convenient mode of travel on the rough roads of new settlements. The widow's mare, having an allowance of oats in large proportion to her work, chanced to feel in a frisky humor; and set off with the old lady at a pace far beyond the dignified and steady trot to which she had been trained for years, while she bore about the revered person of the deceased Deacon. In vain did her mistress, relying on long acquaintance and the sober habits of the steed, pull at the reins and ejaculate, "Whoa, Dobbin, whoa." At every twitch the unruly mare quickened her pace. Perhaps she could not discriminate between the restraining exertions of the dame and the constant jerkings with which her old master habitually regaled her mouth every time he rose in his stirrups. At any rate, Dobbin's legs went on in an andante measure astonishing to the spectators who knew the animal's general character. From rapid trot to canter, and from canter to gallop, away she went,-winding among the rocks and stumps and dashing through or leaping over the holes and sloughs. Never, since colt-hood, had she dreamed of running such a rig before.</p> 
               <p>Bounce, bounce went the old lady, from her saddle to the mare's neck and from the mare's neck to the saddle again. At length, the oscillations from the centre of gravity became so extreme as to threaten immediate dissolution of copartnership between the horse and rider; when, luckily, the beast came plump upon Sam's wheelbarrow. The sight of this obstacle somewhat sobered her pace; till, as she checked herself to consider whether, on the whole, it was worth while to jump over it for the sake of continuing the frolic, her mind was suddenly made up upon the point, by Sam's broad hand upon the bridle.</p> 
               <p>Now the dame was kind-hearted and charitable, and gratitude for Sam's timely interposition came in aid of her sympathy for his wretchedly shabby appearance.</p> 
               <p>"Sammooel," said she, "you have, under Providence, saved me from great danger, and I will reward you. Come up to my house to-night, when work is over."</p> 
               <p>"What's the use, ma'am?" replied Sam. "'Twan't no trouble to me; 'tan't worth talking about."</p> 
               <p>"O come up, Sammooel; it will be worth your while. Come up when your work's done."</p>

               <p>"Well, come up and get your supper, and I will talk with you about something to your advantage."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, ma'am. But somehow or other I han't never found much to my advantage yet. Things is always contrary with me. It an't the natur on me to<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6274-00000009"/> get along as some folks does; and the reason on't I think may be"-</p> 
               <p>"Well, well, Sammooel,-we'll talk it over tonight. Now turn the old mare round and lead her over that bad hole; and let me see whether she will go home, like a decent beast, as I always took her to be."</p> 
               <p>"O ma'am, appearances is desateful. Accidents will happen. And fact, ma'am, if I lived as easy as the old mare, seems to me, I should feel like raisin' Cain about all the time."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Sammooel, I must go along. Let go the bridle now."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
               <p>AS Dame Butler jogged off homeward, Shirk's philosophy, having no longer an audience, returned to its perch in the shade of the store, and held communion with itself.</p> 
               <p>"Now," said he to himself "there's one advantage in taking things easy. My wheelbarrow saved the old lady's getting throw'd off; and she'll give me a pound o' tobakker or some sich matter. But it's some ways up to her house, and I don't know as I'd go for a pound o' tobakker. But then she might think I wasn't perlite; and, besides, I promised, and a bargin's a bargin."</p> 
               <p>So the latter part of the afternoon found him upon the road; and, after some dozen halts to inform everybody he met, how "the widder's mare had run away, and how his barrow had stopt her, and how he was going to get a pound o' tobakker or some sich likes," he reached his destination at last, in time for the early meal that closed the day.</p> 
               <p>He found the careful dame employed, with a young girl that she kept as "help," in baking the bread and brewing a "dish of tea." The Indian corn cakes soon smoked upon the board, supported by a huge plated of boiled potatoes and salt fish. Without any ceremony the trio sat down to the meal, to which Sam, at least, did full justice. After their appetites were sated, the<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6274-00000010"/> matron drew her chair aside, while her damsel cleared away the relics of the repast. Her guest's eyes followed each dish, as it retired, as if he wished that his capacity for containing could have been enlarged in their favor; for so comfortable a chance was, to him, of dubious recurrence.</p> 
               <p>"Now, Sam," said the widow; and, as she commenced, her auditor, assuming a look of attention, prepared himself for the session by some manuvres essential in his mind to the occasion. First, he drew from his pocket a short, smutty pipe, which he knocked upside down against the mantel-bar to clear it of ashes. Then, depositing it by his side, he drew up a squared block that served as a chimney-corner seat, and, establishing himself thereupon, produced from the same pouch a hand of tobacco and the new knife. This latter he eyed for a moment on one side, then turned it and examined the other. Next, he slowly opened the blade, and renewed, upon the steel, the inspection the handle had already undergone. Your regular whittler always examines his knife, with careful gravity, every time he takes it in hand. Not that he is likely to make any discoveries,-for he does it twenty times a day. It is a little piece of coquetry that probably gives the same pleasure a dandy receives from stroking a moustache, or a lady in toying with her curls. At any rate, Sam looked his knife all over, and with especial complacency, as it was a new acquisition; for the fruits of his labors were not so abundant as to have deadened by frequency the soft titillations of the bump of acquisitiveness. This ceremony performed, he cut a bit of tobacco, crumbled it in his palm, and loading his pipe, laid a small coal thereon, with the help of a chip. When two or three puffs had insured successful combustion, he edged himself into the corner of the broad fire-place, that the smoke might not incommode his hostess, and began vigorously to dispense to his nostrils a cloud of the fragrant vapor. There remained yet one other requisite to complete a perfectly felicitous arrangement. This was readily supplied by a small cedar rift that lay among the little pile of fuel at one end of the hearth. Sam seized upon this; and squatting upon his block, laid it out straight between his knees,-one end on the floor, the other grasped in his left hand. Applying the bright knife-blade to the upper end of the fissile wood, he paused for a moment and looked up at his companion, as much as to say, "Now for it."</p> 
               <p>The knife moved up and down, regular as she piston of a steam-engine; and as the long slivers piled up rapidly at his feet, the conversation thus proceeded.</p> 
               <p>"Now, Sam, who would have thought of the old mare's running away! A little more, and she would have broken my neck."</p> 
               <p>"She did go like stashey," quoth Sam. Who or what this queerly baptized illustrative might be, we can't say; and we do presume Sam couldn't.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Sammooel, she went terrible fast, and I began to be afeard. I feel under obligations to you for stopping her, and I want to do something for you. I don't think you lead a creditable life, Sammooel."</p> 
               <p>"Ahem!" grunted out her auditor. The grunt was about equally compounded of surprise and indignation, with perhaps a dash of reluctant assent. Having no special defense prepared, he thus prudently passed the matter over for the time, under protest.</p> 
               <p>"Take it kind now, Sammooel. Don't you think it would be more decent and comfortable to have a<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6274-00000011"/> home of your own, and do something for yourself, and go to meeting and have good clothes, and keep your face clean? Don't you think it would, Sammooel?"</p> 
               <p>The old lady here paused, and looked with eager expectation for some demonstration of interest from her companion in such a brilliant summary of good fortune. But she looked in vain. The sparkle of her own eyes was not reflected in those of her auditor. Sam's eyes, on the contrary, fastened themselves upon the chimney-back; as if the battered bricks could help him to a solution of such grave and perplexing questions. The knife stopped for a moment of profound meditation. The point having been carefully revolved in his mind, the knife resumed its motion; and he announced his own ideas on the subject as follows:-</p> 
               <p>"Now I've sumthin' of an idee, that the more folks has, the more they wants. If they only know'd when they'd got enough, they needn't be workin' and worryin' all the time. What's the use on't? I don't raly stand in need o' them things. I an't necessiated for nothing,-only now and then, leastwise. Some folks wants to be plaguin' themselves about forty-eleven things all the time. Now I don't,-and"-</p> 
               <p>"But, Sammooel," interrupted the widow,-for she well knew Sam's harangue might not come to an end very speedily, unless it was chopped off short,-"suppose I should give you the little place down by Jim Sharp's: it's got a log-house and a well and a pigsty,-and you can cut some logs and build a barn, and it's part fenced already, and you can soon make it so snug!"</p> 
               <p>The good dame's eyes lighted up once more with benevolent anticipation, as she watched the effect of this <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup de main</foreign> upon the obdurate Sam; and this times not without the desired response.</p> 
                
               <p>It would never have entered his head to have earned a farm by his own labor; or, if it had, he would as soon have seriously thought of drinking up the Narraguagus. But to get one for nothing,-to become a man of property without lifting a finger! Mammon carried the day, and his vagabond philosophy gave in. To do him justice, too, a higher and better feeling was mingled with the exultation of this most unexpected advancement. So light-hearted and unrepining as Sam had been through the dreary days of his cheerless youth, his neighbors, when they thought at all about it, probably half believed that he was indifferent to blessings he had never known. And in some measure he was so. For a merciful Providence has given to long habit and use a remedial power, which can blunt the keen edge of annoyance, and even sometimes gradually turn a weary burden into an almost grateful necessity. Sorrow gets at last to be, an old acquaintance, whose comings and goings are little regarded, and whose ugly face may come even to be missed with a degree of uneasy disturbance. Sam himself hardly knew the extent of his deprivations; but occasional painful glimpses into brighter hearts told him now and then, if but faintly, how blank and dull was his own. Some token of a kind father's care or the soft words of some fond mother now and then brought a vague pain to his careless spirit,-even if he himself knew neither the reason nor the cause of it. He carried, along with his apathetic contentment, a smothered feeling that he had not in life all that life owed him; that he was tolerated rather than welcomed; and that, though he was nowhere treated with unkindness, there were daily feasts of love for others, while to him were only swept some careless<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6274-00000012"/> crumbs. Never before, for long years, had a human voice spoken a personal and warm interest for him. Never, since his almost lost recollections of his mother's pale and listless face, had he seen a human being bend upon him a look of heartfelt kindness, or testify for him a wish to do more than relieve some petty want of the passing moment. It was a sudden burst of sunshine upon the leaden sky of his unblessed existence. A feeling of astonishment, almost of awe, at finding himself within the pale of sympathy and affection, succeeded the first natural burst of joyous surprise. He sat still for a moment, and struggling tears rolled down his bronzed cheeks. He jumped up nervously from his block, dropped the cedar rift, shut up his knife and put it into his pocket. Having gained time by these preliminaries to meet the unexpected emergency with some shadow of propriety, he boiled over in a half blubber, half shout,-</p> 
               <p>"Will you, though? Good on yer head! It <emph>would</emph> be clever to have a place to myself where I could do as I had a mind'ter. But then"-his face lengthening-"there'll be a tarnal sight of work to do!" and Sam sighed deeply with the sudden conflict awakened between ambition and indolence.</p> 
               <p>"Besides, you can have a privilege in my wood-lot behind," added Mrs. Butler, following him up hard; "and I'll give you one of my sow-pigs too; and you can come up here and get the wash for it every day till you get settled."</p> 
               <p>Sam now surrendered at discretion. "It's a bargin," said he, "and thank you kindly. I'll see what I can do at farmin' a spell."</p> 
               <p>"Then," replied his benefactress, "here's a deed of the place, Sammooel,"-putting at the same time the document into his hand.</p> 
                
               <p>Shirk took it with a grin of delight. But uncultivated Yankees seldom act upon sancho's delicate maxim,-"not to look the gift horse in the mouth." The value of a thing must be a carefully settled by arithmetical rule, before they can quietly enjoy it as their own. Sam read over his deed with labor and pains, and with as much care to ascertain its validity as if he had paid for it with many a dollar. Having spent many idle hours in lounging about the justice's courts holden from time to time in the old log school-house, he had picked up a smattering of legal terms and some few truths among more errors. The scrutiny of the deed elicited, however, no suspicion or objection. It bore at the bottom the countersign of Squire Preston, who, of the rival lawyers of the village, was Sam's oracle; and, like wiser men, Sam rested his faith, perhaps, more on authorities than on pure law. So he pocketed the paper, and expressed again his gratitude as he refilled his pipe.</p> 
               <p>"Well, ma'am-good on yer head, I say agin. Not that I arned it of ye-I'm bound to ye for't. And I hope it won't be no shame to neither on us. And now I guess I'll be goin'; for it's gittin' late and it's sumthin' of a walk."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Sammooel, you must try to be industrious and you'll do well."</p> 
               <p>Sam winced a little at the thought of the new system to which he was so suddenly pledged. The image of potato-fields to be hoed under hot suns somewhat qualified his happier anticipations. But the dignity of proprietorship bore him up against the unwelcome part of the prospect; and he already felt something of the stimulus and the energy with which the hope and pride of independence inspires the laboring<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6274-00000013"/> ing classes in a free land. His gypsy theories vanished in the light of higher prospects, as uneasy dreams disappear with the broad daylight. He resolved to try the policy of labor and thrift, with no other reservation but to do no more of the first than was necessary to secure the last; and among the desultory fruits of his vagrant experience was that practical ingenuity which often makes so tolerable a substitute for hard work. Visions of plenteous meals and comfortable firesides, even of a Mrs. Sam Shirk and a quantum suff, of little Shirks, dawned upon his awakened fancy. A melodious grunt from without doors recalled him to earth and reality, in the remembrance of the pig that was to crown the widow's bounty.</p> 
               <p>"You han't got no rope to lend me to drive the critter with-have ye, ma'am?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Sammooel-you may take that piece that hangs up on the peg behind the door."</p> 
               <p>Equipped with the rope, Sam sallied out, and soon noosing his prize, departed in triumph amid the loud grunting and squealing of his prisoner and her sympathizing relatives. Between coaxing and whipping he drove his obstinate companion to his new dwelling; for he had determined to move in instanter. The lack of furniture and utensils troubled him but little; for his wants were few and simple, and his expedients many.</p> 
               <p>So he turned the pig into the kitchen for the time, and, shutting her in, collected a few armfuls of the delicate spray of the silver fir, wherewith he made himself a bed perfectly to his mind, in the other apartment of the house. "I suppose," said he to himself, "I'd ought'r set a chunk o' wood or a stone agin that 'ere door, afore I turn in. But it's got to be dark out, and it an't much use. I guess the pig won't try to get away." Without further to do, he laid himself down; and his happy turn of luck filling his brain with pleasant fancies, he and the pig were soon rivaling each other in musical evidences of slumber.</p> 
               <p>The worthy widow, too, went to rest, happy in the unselfish joy of a benevolent heart; and the golden pen to the recording angel wrote down in immortal characters a blessed deed that might have balanced an age of sin.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
               <p>ABOUT the middle of the next forenoon, Sam again made his appearance at the widow's, evidently looking rather sheepish, though he endeavored to maintain his usual air of listless unconcern.</p> 
               <p>"Sammooel," said the dame, looking up from the tub in which she was preparing the potatoes for dinner, "you ought to have come sooner for the wash. Pigs are creaturs that must be fed regular, to thrive."</p> 
               <p>Sam looked still more blank and silly at this address. He stopped and picked up a chip; took out his knife, and began to whittle out a duck's head. Then he threw it away, as if dissatisfied with his work, and, picking up another chip, commenced anew. At last, gathering courage, he observed, with seeming coolness, "I've concluded to part with the pig, ma'am, to Jem Sharp."</p> 
               <p>"Part with the pig!" screamed out the indignant widow; "and so, Sammooel, that's the way you treat friends! Sell the pig I gave you only last night!"</p> 
               <p>"No, ma'am," said Sam, straightening up,-"not so bad as that quite. I han't told you exactly."</p> 
               <p>"What then, Sam?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, the long and short on't is, I didn't fasten her up as I'd ought'r; and she got out and killed two of Jem's hens and his great red rooster."</p> 
               <p>"Well, now, that was dreadful keerless; but what's that got to do with selling her?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Nothing ma'am. But Jem said he'd sue me unless I gin him the pig. As 'twan't no use to go to law, I let him have her."</p> 
               <p>"What!" said the old lady, nowise better pleased,-"give that pig for two hens and a rooster! 'Twas as handsome a pig as ever I raised. Sam, you're a fool!"</p> 
               <p>Sam looked, indeed, very much like what he was so summarily set down for, but still stood on the defense.</p> 
               <p>"Well, ma'am, may be I am. But Squire Preston himself would tell you 'twas an ugly fix. The pig was fairly cotch a-trespassin',-and 'twould have been trespass querry clossum," added he, in a dignified tone, "and Squire Preston would say so. If I'd a stood Jem, I should sartin have been throwed; for Jem's two boys swore they see her catch 'em. So he'd a got the costs on to me; and the pig wouldn't have paid 'em, to sell her twice over."</p> 
               <p>"And has Jem got the pig now?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, ma'am. And I've got a receipt in full of all damages," said Sam, exchanging his demure tone of apology for a more self-satisfied one. I know'd what was wanted there, anyhow."</p> 
               <p>He then handed, for her inspection, a paper folded over to an inch square, which, being opened, displayed, in an odd mixture of printing and writing letters, the following tenor:-</p> 
               <q>

               </q> 
               <p>"There, ma'am," says Sam, triumphantly, "you can't say that an't regolar, nohow."</p> 
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6274-00000015"/> 
               <p>The widow made no answer, but turning over the paper, saw with surprise her own name upon the back, in the identical wandering characters with which she was not to achieve her signature.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Sam!" screamed she in new alarm; "you've torn the deed."</p> 
               <p>"Why, yes, ma'am. We hadn't no paper, and I jest tore off a strip: it didn't take but one line o' the writing, and it couldn't hurt the vartoo on't."</p> 
               <p>"One line, to be sure! And that was my signature, and now it isn't good for anything."</p> 
               <p>"But then you won't go to dispute it," replied Sam, with a little alarm in his own tones. "You wouldn't, I'm sartin; and if you don't, who can? That's law, I know."</p> 
               <p>"No, Sam, I won't dispute it; I'll get Squire Preston to make another; but you must pay for it, to cure you of your keerlessness."</p> 
               <p>"Now what's the use? I'm satisfied, and it's good agin everybody but you, I know. I should have to work for the Squire a whole day." Sam's face grew very long with the anticipation. But Mrs. Butler saw that it was high time to take the management of matters into her own hands, and announced to him her design accordingly.</p> 
               <p>"Well, Sammooel, we'll go and see the Squire, and he shall make Jem give up the pig. I an't going to have him cheat you so, that's certain."</p> 
               <p>"Cheat me!" cried Sam, growing warm in turn-"cheat me! No, that he didn't, nor no other man in "Guagus don't do it. I can hoe my row with any man on the footstool. Besides," continued he, working himself up to a pitch of wrath and obstinacy at such offensive insinuations, "I gin him the pig, and a bargin's a bargin; and tan't best to say no more about it."</p> 
               <p>"Hold your tongue, Sammooel. I shan't hear of any such thing as Jem's having her; and, if you an't going to behave yourself, I don't know as I'll give you a new deed of the place. I thought you knew better."</p> 
               <p>Shirk now found matters were getting serious; and prudently acquired in accompanying the widow to the Squire's, carrying at her command, in a basket covered with a towel, two hens and a gentleman-bird of the same species. The Squire, having been duly informed upon the case and received the instructions of his client, set off at once, in company with Sam and his basket, upon his embassage to Sharp. Sam felt rather small about the business; and announced to the Squire that he would sit down in the "door-yard" in custody of the feathered part of the concern, and await the issue of his negotiations.</p> 
               <p>The lawyer found Jem as cool as a cucumber, in full faith of having gotten the advantage, and with, firm intent to keep it. But the threatened displeasure of Dame Butler, backed with some weighty legal suggestions and a formal tender of the cock and hens, which were admitted, after many demurs, to equal the victims of the pig's malfeasance in all excellent hen-like qualities, staggered Sharp's determination a little. He felt that he was no match for the Squire, and was like to get into bad odor at the least; and a hint of a chapter in the statute-book concerning swindling and similar topics, finally effected the desired arrangement. The fowls were turned out among Jem's stock, and the pig released and safely shut up in the pig-sty upon Sam's contiguous premises; and both parties were<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6274-00000016"/> thus placed in <foreign xml:lang="LAT">statu quo ante bellum</foreign>-a more fortunate termination than is found for most human controversies.</p> 
               <p>As they retraced their steps, Shirk, anxious to retrieve his character in the eyes of his companion, ventured to boast of the legal acumen displayed in the release, as he had done with the window.</p> 
               <p>"You can't say nothin' again the release part on't, anyhow, Squire!"</p> 
               <p>"O, no!" replied the Squire, shouting with laughter; "I'll uphold that as a good and sufficient release of cock-a-doodle-doos and all other doos, in any court of Christendom. It's natural you should crow over that, Sam."</p> 
               <p>"If it hadn't bin the Squire," Sam afterwards declared, "I'd a whipped him, or he should a whipped me, of the very worst kind." However, he prudently refrained; and the Squire laughed so heartily at his own wit, that Sam finally laughed too. As they stopped at his office door, Mr. Preston wound up with an exhortation to his companion to keep out of such scrapes in future.</p> 
               <p>Sam stopped, set down the empty basket, picked up a chip, and fell to whittling. The Squire waited patiently the answer which he knew to be dependent on the point to which Sam was sharpening down his stick. When he looked up to speak, his face wore an expression so serious and so different from his usual devil-may-care phiz, that his monitor was fairly startled. Greater still was his astonishment when his companion deliberately avowed a determination to make himself industrious, and independent.</p> 
               <p>"You! Sam,-well, who would have believed that! But you are right, Sam Stick to that, and you shall thrive." After this exordium, he took out his pocket memorandum book, wrote upon a leaf, tore it out, and handed it to Shirk.</p> 
               <p>"You're right, Sam-stick to it like a man. There's an order on Tom Tape for ten dollars to help fit you out, and two dollars a month for four months out of his store. If you're afraid I shall ask for it back, I'll write you a receipt for all cock-a-doodle-doos to this date." So saying, the Squire walked off, shaking his sides with merriment, and leaving Sam, as he expressed it, "all in a mis-maze."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
               <p>THERE is no more marked characteristic of this world than what our philosophers please to call its imperfection. In morals and in physics, the abstract principle is seldom found perfect or unalloyed. The concrete development and visible form combine, always, more or less exceptional matter. Everything works, at times, what seems mischief to our partial perceptions. From the golden circlet of the year, with all its beautiful and wonderful beneficence, dart forth, from point to point, casualties that sting like serpents hidden in a wreath of flowers. The glorious source of physical life and light pours down the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup de soleil</foreign> upon the incautious head. The air that is the breath of our nostrils, sweeps us away in the hurricane, withers and freezes us in the polar blast, and stifles us in the sirocco. The elements that are our ministers, and are assumed, by our complacent vanity, to have been created only for that purpose, must be watched continually, or they become our masters and destroyers. In the moral world, the noblest virtues trench narrowly upon the meanest vices; and the head must be clear indeed, and the resolve steady, that can maintained the exact line of right. Countless disturbing influences cause the sensitive and impulsive spirit to oscillate about the straight and narrow path. The magnet, through every faithful to its mysterious polarity, is stationary and true only in a state of repose and isolation lation unknown to human hearts. Even under the most favorable conditions, our spirits waver over an endless cycle of aberration, returning to their precise meridian only to wander on the other side.</p> 
               <p>Yet there are and always have been wiseacres who constantly demanded an invariable rectitude from that sensitive and irritable thing, the soul of man; making, of course, their own opinion the standard, and their own discretion the judge. They forget that if the world could be brought up to their pattern,-admitting for the time the infallibility of their decisions,-there would be no need of any other heaven; and that therefore either heaven or earth is a useless superfluity in the economy of Providence. Their stiff-necked ethics do not recognize that there could be no school without a task, no virtue without temptation, no charity without suffering and sin. They cannot perceive that the most generous impulses of our nature are just those which dash now and then beyond the limits of the beaten path. Their arithmetical conscientiousness has no feeling, no generous sympathy, no delicate perception. It will not see that our kindly emotions, our gentle affections, the sweet attachments of love and passion, of home and kindred and country, are all inevitably based upon universal imperfection, upon mutual wants and daily necessities.</p> 
               <p>What needs the mother care for the child, if it were born a "hinfant phenomenon?" What needs the child revere or love its parents, if it lacked neither guidance nor support? What need of affection, tenderness, benevolence, if every human being stood upright in the rigidity of absolute exactitude?</p> 
               <p>The cold ascetics of moral and religious formulas measures excellence by feet and inches on the scale of<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6274-00000018"/> a creed, and never feel it as a spiritual tendency. They cannot understand that many a man, who errs often and widely, carries yet a purer soul within his breast and lifts to heaven a nobler countenance than many a precise formalist and rigid disciplinarian. This sour and ugly error is one that creeps readily into the creed of most reformers. The peculiar religious position and tenets of our Puritan forefathers gave to it a wider range and a more repulsive aspect than common. Never in the world's history was there a set of men of higher thought and nobler principle, or of more narrow sympathies, or more chilling exterior. Their peculiarities have not yet disappeared from New England life; and even now a shadow of their religious gloom rests upon its society. But two generations ago, their prejudices and whims were in full force. A smile on the Sabbath was a sin, a dance was an outrage, and a mince-pie had hardly ceased <emph>to be an abomination.</emph> Pleasure was, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ipso facto,</foreign> crime, and privation and abnegation virtue. In every little country village, you might find a pattern man,-a deacon, probably,-whose chief business was to play the part of a scarecrow in a cornfield, towards all the graces and amenities of life; to glorify God by degrading man, to frighten the children into a moping dullness, and to exhort the women and dragoon the men into a jealous, dogmatic, and bitter conventionalism. Merrifield had such a one, in the person of Deacon Hardly.</p> 
               <p>The Deacon was one of those men that seem to be run out of lead, or baked of brick clay in a mould, rather than made of flesh and blood. He was almost entirely negative. What he was not, made up pretty much all that he was. Nature had given him one of those short-sighted minds that can see about to the end of their owner's nose, but no further, without the aid of some moral spectacles to prolong the range of vision. And such spectacles the Deacon would never have sought, or used if he had them. For he firmly believed that what he could not see, was not to be seen at all; and that what he did not know, did not exist. Within his own sphere he was sensible and shrew enough; but beyond that, he was not only ignorant of everything, but ignored everything. The Deacon was no speculator, though he loved money well; he could pick it up by hoarded pennies, but never amass it by venturous thousands. He was a narrow-mouthed bottle, to be filled only drop by drop. More would run over and be spilled. He was not benevolent or charitable; he seldom gave anything but advice. He was not a rogue or a bad-hearted man; in fact, what allowance of heart he had, was consumed at home, in a humdrum regard for his wife and family and, to some very moderated degree, for kindred more remote. He had not much feeling, good or bad, to waste on the world in general. He never begged or bestowed favors; never took his neighbor's property, except in fair trade, not let anybody get a cent of his own, without an equivalent. He never sang, except at meeting; seldom laughed, and never joked. He seldom pitied or grieved for others, and never wept.</p> 
               <p>The Deacon talked of nothing but business or religion. The latter was his hobby; and a popular one, in those days, more than now. Yet, though constant at church and prayer-meeting, severe in manner, prompt and harsh to admonish backsliders, and elaborately correct in his own deportment, he was not devout, though he thought himself eminently so. But the spirit of the golden rule dwelt not in his bosom.<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6274-00000019"/> He did not love God or man with a Christian's love. Yet Hardy was no hypocrite. He was conscientious in his own fashion; but his conscience was a soulless one,-like a Connecticut clock, the cheapest and meanest thing that could be made to travel, with apparent regularity, the daily round. His conscience was negative, like the rest of him. It never urged him to a great or good action, but only frightened him out of bad ones; and was very easy, too, with such as were only mean, hard, or selfish, yet not exactly criminal.</p> 
               <p>To conclude, the Deacon, in some sense, did as well as he knew; but he should have known better. He had suffered selfishness and arrogance to master his spirit and his life, as the rough, dry bark cases up the tree. Though he sowed some wheat, he let the tares grow up with it and choke its growth.</p> 
               <p>Now Deacon Hardy, as we have said, loved to give advice, if he gave nothing else. Every little escapade of the boys, or innocent folly of the girls, or maturer errors of their elders, was sure to be visited with his censure. He was at once self-constituted Chief Justice and High Sheriff of Merrifield. Our friend Shirk especially was the favorite object of his denunciations; for, as the one idea of the Deacon was that of methodical precision, Sam, its very antipodes, was the chiefest of sinners. His antipathy to Sam had another reason, too, besides the unblushing and irreclaimable defiance of wholesome discipline shown by that harum-scarum cosmopolite. For Shirk was shrewd and observant, and far wiser in his way, in fact, than his censor. He generally contrived to retaliate the Deacon's animadversions, by pungent hints and absurd counter-thrusts, that hit all the harder because they were so adroitly conveyed that they could not be openly controverted or resented.</p> 
                
               <p>When the Deacon heard of the widow Butler's bounty to Shirk, and of his opening career of improvement, he indulged in sundry depreciatory remarks. He wondered that the widow didn't know that she couldn't make silk purses out of sows ears," and often quoted the proverb that professes to tell in what quarter beggars are to ride, when they get on horseback,-together with many other equally amiable comments upon the judiciousness of the matter.</p> 
               <p>Now the minister and many others said that Deacon Hardy was the most exemplary man in Merrifield; and the Deacon, in a quiet, humble way, thought so too. Yet there were some who saw reason for believing Shirk, in his "looped and windowed raggedness," and with all his vagabondism, the better man of the two. If misfortune overtook any of the little community, the Deacon was always running over with critical discussions of the how and the wherefore. "Anybody, with half an eye, might have seen how it would be"-"so and so was a well-meaning man, but he was always in trouble," or "it was unaccountable to him why such a one didn't do this," or the other poor devil "neglected to do that." But while his neighbors' sorrows and calamities thus served, with Deacon Hardy, to display his own wisdom and afford instructive contrasts to his own discreet and successful example, they were sure to find with Sam Shirk a generous and unhesitating sympathy. He did not stop to discuss the causes or the legitimacy of their distress, but forthwith sought to relieve and comfort it, if he could. He was always ready to give all he had, which frequently, to be sure, was little or nothing; and he would go, in all weathers, to any distance on a charitable errand.</p> 
               <p>A short time after Dame Butler had made Sam a<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6274-00000020"/> freeholder, the tall, gaunt figure of Deacon Hardy came down the road one morning, on the way to his "store," or, as it might elsewhere be called, his shop. He marched along, punching the ground with his cane at every step, as if to make sure that each stride was of just the proper length. The Deacon had enjoyed a good breakfast, and, according to general physiological rules, should have been in good humor; but "creature comforts" were not allowed to influence the stately march of his mind. A genial satisfaction seldom warmed up his heart, or diluted the acerbity of his censures,-as with common then that don't live according to "the statue in such case made and provided." Seeing Sam loitering near the door of his shop, he sharply accosted him:-</p> 
               <p>"Here, Sam! they say you've set up for yourself at last. High time you did! You know I've advised you to do it many a time."</p> 
               <p>"You have so, Deacon," replied Sam, "and no mistake. You've advised me to do it very often, and," added Sam with considerable unction. "Widder Butler's gin me somethin' to do it with-good on her head!"</p> 
               <p>"Well, Sam, I hope you'll improve the chance, and be thankful to Providence, and not be larking round any more."</p> 
               <p>"I hope I shall," answered Shirk, laconically; and then, after a moment's pause as he turned the Deacon's homily over in his mind, he slyly winked to the bystanders, and added, "Hope I shall. I'll try to be thankful to Providence for the chance, and to the widder for the farm, and to you for the advice; and, when I can, I'll return it in kind all round."</p> 
               <p>Sam looked the Deacon full in the face, as grave as himself. That important personage doubted for a while whether Sam was bantering him or not, but finally concluded such an incredible impertinence to be impossible. So, proceeding with his authoritative counsel, he rejoined:-</p> 
               <p>"Well, I'm glad you're in a creditable frame of mind. Dame Butler's been very generous. 'Twas full as much as you deserved, Sam; and you must make a good use of it!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, sir; it's a plaguy sight more than I desarved. It an't every day a man finds sich a friend; and I'd sooner burn my fingers off than put her out, any time. I mean to make it do for my life-time, if I'm lucky. I shan't ask the widder for no more, you may depend. But as advice is cheaper than farms is, praps if I should get out o' the article, I might call <emph>on you</emph> agin."</p> 
               <p>The ludicrous gravity with which this speech, so a suggestive of the well-known character of the Deacon's benevolence, was delivered, upset the composure of the by-standers; and a smile passed round the circle of idlers that had gathered round,-breaking out, here and there, in an audible snigger.</p> 
               <p>Hardy, perceiving that the sympathy of the audience and the argument were both going against him, retreated into his shop, and left his saucy antagonist master of the field. Sam poured out a parting volley at the closing door.</p> 
               <p>"There's a sight o' folks in the world, that'll always be tellin' what ought'r be done, and never helpin' nobody to do it. When a feller's dawn in the mud, and an't got nothin' nor nobody to hold on by, what's the use o' tellin' him as how he'd best get up on his legs,-as if he didn't know that well enough before?<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6274-00000021"/> Now I like to see a man put out his hand and help him up; that's somethin' worth havin'. But hang yer advice to do what ye want to do bad enough, but can't."</p> 
               <p>Having thus disposed of the topic to his own satisfaction, and to the apparent content of his audience, Shirk took himself off to Tom Tape's, to make some purchases, with an air of dignity hardly inferior to that of the Deacon himself.</p> 
               <p>The latter functionary had retired into his shop considerably annoyed, and endeavored to forget his vaxation by awaiting upon a little knot of customers. But after putting up a pound of tea for a pound of pepper, and drawing a gallon of molasses in the oil measure, he left it all again to his clerk, and returned to his favorite employment of minding his neighbors' business,-attention to his own being, for the time, quite out of the question.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
               <p>DEACON HARDY was a sort of privy-councillor to those of the community of Merrifield who had no better. His well-known shrewdness in management and prominence as a thrifty man and the holder of an office which in those days was of high authority, together with his peculiar propensity to interfere with everything that he could in any degree control, made him a sort of public administrator and guardian to all who needed or would submit to his guidance.</p> 
               <p>The widow Butler, having, in the absence of her son, no natural adviser, often recurred to his opinion, when at a loss in the conduct of her affairs. The good old lady had reverenced and loved her deceased husband, as he had well deserved to be at the hands of all who knew him. His ecclesiastical distinction had added not a little, in her eyes, to the weight of a character of natural intelligence! and force as well as genuine integrity and kindness. Kings, emperors, and presidents had, to be sure, a shadowy and far-off preminence in her mind; but of all the tangible and appreciable honors known to her practically, except those of the minister, the name and functions of deacon were, to her paramount. She had revered them in the departed, and her fond and pious awe was transferred, in some measure, to the surviving partner of her husband in that responsible office. As the dead Deacon's opinion<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6274-00000022"/> had been to her the essence both of law and gospel, that of the living one carried with it an almost indisputable authority.</p> 
               <p>"Cum qu ita sint," as Cicero says,-these matters standing thus. Deacon Hardy wondered much and fretted more that the widow had taken a step so important as her donation to Sam Shirk without consulting his superior wisdom. The gift of some fifty acres of half wild land was, in that time and place, not so much for the kind benefactress to bestow, as to monetary value,-through an invaluable benefit to the receiver. But his natural right of ultimate appeal had been infringed; and Sam's unceremonious raid upon his personal dignified pretensions tended not a little to sharpen his discontent and arouse his criticism. So, after sitting uneasily for a time upon the head of a flour-barrel, he took his hat and set out for the house of Mrs. Butler.</p> 
               <p>Knocking at the door, rather for a sort of familiar apology for neglect of ceremony than as making any question of his admission, he ushered himself, without waiting for any answer to his summons, into the dame's common apartment. In a different state of society, the visit might have been, at such a time, by no means welcome; for the apparatus of the breakfast-table was still in process of being cleared away, and the mistress of the house was herself occupied in arranging the preliminaries of dinner, while her handmaiden washed and put away the material of the earlier meal.</p> 
               <p>But nobody in Merrifield, in those days, was ashamed of being caught in doing anything that was necessary to be done. There was no tearing off of aprons, hasty wiping of hands, huddling up of dishes or other evidence of disconcerted movements. After a calm salutation, indeed, the old lady suspended her own labors; and, giving to her domestic the programme of further operations, turned quietly to her visitor.</p> 
               <p>The latter, according to his invariable habit, glanced rapidly round the room to scan and criticise, before he sat himself down. Previously to taking the offered chair, he first boxed the ears of the old cat who was lying in the sun upon the soft cushion of her mistress's arm-chair, saying, as he inflicted the admonitory cuff, "You'll do well enough on the floor, Pussy."</p> 
               <p>Dame Butler looked a little askance at the attack upon her purring favorite, but said nothing. She knew the ways of the offender too well. Economy was not only a calculation with him, it was a passion; and it nettled him to see what he thought to be waste or improvidence in his neighbors' affairs as much as in his own. His acquired habit of dictation led him to interfere unhesitatingly with everything, great or small, that did not suit his views; and his ready advice boiled over constantly on all short-comings that met his eye. He never troubled himself to see that this petty censure did much more harm than good, and was often greatly astonished that his suggestions were not more graciously received. He could or would see but one way for everything; and that, of course, was his own. That anybody might have a fancy or should devise a plan which they should prefer to his, was to his mind about as rational a scheme as to contrive something better than the sun to warm and light up the world. So the Deacon drove poor Pussy out of her comfortable lair; but he did not occupy the vacated luxury himself. He was simply deeply impressed with the idea that the cushion was not made for the<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6274-00000023"/> cat's comfort; and he wanted to see it saved for more appropriate uses. He sat himself down after thus discharging this economic duty, in one of the flag-bottomed chairs of that primitive model that seems to have been devised by Puritan ingenuity as a security against self-indulgence.</p> 
               <p>After some trivial matter-of-course remarks, he broached the subject that lay so engrossingly in his mind.</p> 
               <p>"Well, ma'am," said he, "I hear you've given Sam Shirk your farm down the road?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," replied the widow, "I've given him the little place there." She was a little ruffled at the treatment of her cat; and her tone seemed rather to decline any further interference in her own matters. But her visitors was not easily to be put down; and this contempt of his authority only served to increase the bitterness of the Deacon's mood. He sat silent for a minute, poking with his cane at a straw upon the floor, with a fierce perseverance, as if he thought it a very ill-behaved and reprobate straw indeed.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile, the damsel, who was washing up dishes at the table, redoubling her activity, in order to make up for the temporary withdrawal of her mistress, laid down several plates from her towel with a somewhat greater emphasis than usual. The fretful Deacon threw towards her an unamiable glance, which passed harmless and unnoticed over the head of the girl, who was too zealously occupied to heed anything but her work. Presently came along a cup, which, being duly wiped, was deposited in its saucer without a proper calculation of its centre of gravity, and rolled over upon its side. The patience of the Deacon lost its balance too, and he gruffly growled out,-</p> 
                
               <p>"Betsey, don't make such a clatter! I can't hear a word." This was nothing very singular, apparently, as nobody had spoken. "Ma'am, why don't you stop her? She's smashing all your things up, as if they didn't cost anything."</p> 
               <p>Betsey's rosy lips puckered up, and an angry flush passed over her face. But she did not dare to show disrespect for the awful functionary of the church. The undeserved rebuke was, nevertheless, scornfully repudiated in her honest heart. Her mistress, too, was pained by the harsh interference, but she, too, shrunk from the audacity of repressing the imperious impertinence. She would about as soon have thought of railing at a cold wind, a scorching sun, or any other dispensation of Providence. She felt deeply, however, the Deacon's crustiness; and, seeking to change the disagreeable topic, mildly asked, "Don't you think I did right, Deacon Hardy?"</p> 
               <p>"What,-to give Sam the place? That depends upon circumstances," sagely replied he.</p> 
               <p>"Why, he saved my life perhaps!"</p> 
               <p>"'Twas Providence saved your life, ma'am," was the oracular answer, accompanied with a dignified and very imposing look upward.</p> 
               <p>"Well, to be sure," answered the widow, with honest warmth, "and Providence sent him to help me; and Providence gave me the means of rewarding him for it. I'm sure I think I couldn't do less than I did."</p> 
               <p>The logic of the old lady's heart was, on this point, and an overmatch for the cold formalism of her companion. He felt his disadvantage and shifted his ground.</p> 
               <p>"But will it do him any good? Sam's a hard case; may be you'll throw away your land for nothing."</p> 
               <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6274-00000024"/> 
               <p>"May be I shall, and may be I shan't, Deacon. But I've done my part, and I hope Sam'll do hizzen. He says he will."</p> 
               <p>"No doubt he does," sneered out the wise man. "No doubt he <emph>says</emph> so."</p> 
               <p>While the discussion was thus proceeding, Pussy, urged by her constitutional taste for comfort, had quietly stolen into the arm-chair again, and lay, curled into a semicircle of delicious indulgence, upon the forbidden cushion. The Deacon's pent-up fury to do some good to somebody, whether they would or not, burst out again upon her luckless head.</p> 
               <p>"What a cat that is! why don't you teach your cat how to behave? It's just as easy as not. The cat never does such things in my house," said he, sweeping her once more on to the floor.</p> 
               <p>And sure enough,-no cat ever attempted such atrocities in the Deacon's house-at least, not in his presence. Experience had taught both cat and dog that there was nothing to be enjoyed peaceably, under his vigilant and stern discipline. His return home was the signal for instant retreat into the safe obscurity of corners. And, the first time the door opened, both Grimalkin and Rover invariably escaped from the apartment honored by his supervision to some quarter where rights and wrongs were less severely construed.</p> 
               <p>Dame Butler now began to share the irritable mood of her visitor; but her mild nature was incapable of violent demonstrations. She could not, however, restrain herself from coming to the rescue of her martyrized dependent, with a gentle remonstrance.</p> 
               <p>"La, now, Deacon, do let the cat be! I always let her sleep in the arm-chair when I don't want it myself."</p> 
                
               <p>Pussy might have added, could she have spoken, that her kind mistress seldom exercised the right of sovereignty, when it interfered with her own snug little arrangements. Many an hour would the kind-hearted woman sit knitting in the uninviting, straight-backed, and flag-bottomed production of the rude home manufacture, and gaze with placid pleasure on the slumbers of her cat, in the capacious and softly stuffed recess of the old heir-loom, which everybody else in the household, but Pussy, held sacred to the use of its chief and oldest member. But she would not disturb the evident satisfaction of Tabby, for the sake of her own ease, in any less case than extreme fatigue or an attack of rheumatism. The sight of enjoyment, even in an animal, was, to her benevolent and quiet spirit, a positive pleasure. To tell the whole truth, the perfect absorption and voluptuous laziness with which a petted mouser luxuriates in a soft, warm couch, went straight to the old lady's heart. She sympathized with it deeply, because it was so thoroughly in unison with the dreamy and dozing quietude with which she herself enjoyed the comfortable lounge over her knitting, when the cat provided herself elsewhere, and the armchair fell to the lot of its more legitimate occupant.</p> 
               <p>In the present emergency, Pussy could do nothing but shake her injured ears and take herself out of the way,-convinced that some untoward influence ruled the hour. The Deacon, satisfied with his success in the contest, now reverted to the main object of his visit.</p> 
               <p>"Now I would have made Sam agree to behave himself before I gave him the farm; and kept it in my own hands till I was satisfied he would turn it to good account. I don't believe you can trust him out o' sight."</p> 
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6274-00000025"/> 
               <p>The widow sat a moment in consternation at the unpromising aspect thus put upon her benevolent scheme. But her own true feelings came to her relief.</p> 
               <p>"Well, Deacon, I'm sorry you don't approve what I have done. You know a great deal better than I, perhaps. But it seems to me it wouldn't be of any use to have tied Sam up with all kinds of promises. If he didn't mean to keep 'em, 'twould only have made the matter worse than ever; and if he did, they wa'n't needed. And, if nobody ever will trust him, how can you ever expect him to feel that he ought to deserve it?"</p> 
               <p>The mentor was now a little puzzled, in his turn. But he sought pertinaciously to contrive some way to put the widow in the wrong; and adopted another line of argument to effect his purpose.</p> 
               <p>"But, ma'am, such lazy, good-for-nothing folks haven't any right to be treated better than they deserve. They ought to work for what they want, and ought to be made to. Providence sends poverty and trouble for a punishment to them that won't do their duty. You not I haven't any right to fly in the face of Providence. Let them take the consequences, till they grow wiser. We haven't any business to take such things out of the Lord's hands."</p> 
               <p>The widow was now; thunderstruck. She had been vexed to be compelled to suspect that she had acted unwisely; but the idea that she had been guilty of impiety was overwhelming. Her hands dropped upon her knees, and she sat looking upon her censor with a face of unutterable dismay. Her companion, on the other hand, drew his cane, up under his chin, and, casting his eyes upward for a moment, subsided into a position of triumphant self-satisfaction. But he had not yet gained the victory. There was a power in the heart of the meek and placid old lady before him, that he knew nothing of,-for it had no place in his own,-the power of Christian charity. For a few moments his unassuming antagonist was stunned into an unresisting amazement. But what she could not reason out, she could feel out; and all her better instincts told her that she was right,-if she could not tell how.</p> 
               <p>Deacon Hardy looked upon men and women as mere machines, a sort of animated spinning-wheels, from which the thread of life was to be produced of given quantity and quality, according to a fixed standard promulgated by authority. His companion felt that there was something more than all this in human existence; though she could not have proved it syllogistically, for her life. The Deacon's authority was great, his words were strong, his conclusions were appalling. But, timid, self-distrusting, and unargumentative as she was, Dame Butler was true to her instincts; and they were good and pure. She could not disprove, but she could despise the Deacon's argument. She heard the low but mighty voice that spoke in her heart, and gave it an indignant utterance. A smile gradually lighted up her features, and the gloom of doubt faded away before it, till, at last, the beautiful truth filled her flushing face with the warmth and dignity of sincere benevolence.</p> 
               <p>"No, no! Deacon Hardy,-it can't be so. The Lord has given to both you and me more than we've deserved, and to many a one blessings they never earned. No, no! that's not his rule. His sun shines and his rain falls on the just and the unjust. If He<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6274-00000026"/> does not judge, it's not my duty to condemn my fellow-creatures, or insist on a price for what little I can do for 'em. If Sam's been a vagabond, he's a man, and feels like one; and I wouldn't be for insulting his feelings. He wants to be treated as if he was somebody, and maybe then he will be somebody. But if his neighbors won't think anything of him, why should he think much of himself? I've done what I could for him; and I an't sorry, and I don't believe he'll want to make me sorry. Deacon, this grinding down folks an't right; it don't do any good."</p> 
               <p>The widow stopped and blushed,-almost frightened by the boldness of her own indignant eloquence. Deacon Hardy looked abashed for some instants, and cowered before the flash of her earnest eye. He had never seen her so aroused before. Indeed, she had never made a speech half so long in her whole life. He saw clearly that he could not overrule her conviction, and took up his hat to go.</p> 
               <p>"Well, well-maybe that's all right. It's hard to settle some of these points; and I can't spare any more time. I hope it'll all turn out right."</p> 
               <p>"No, you don't!" murmured Betsey, as the wiry form vanished through the door.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Betsey!" said the widow,-then returned quietly again to her preparations for dinner.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> 
               <p>DAME BUTLER was one of those good old souls whom it may be difficult to admire, but still more difficult not to respect and love. Her extraordinary simplicity hardly allowed the first emotion; while her genuine and over flowing kindness of heart, honesty of purpose, and truthfulness, irresistibly conciliated the affections, where, they could not command or even satisfy the intellect.</p> 
               <p>Having removed into the wilderness at an early age, she had retained little definite memory of the world at large. The indistinct impressions that remained served only to stimulate what small imaginative power she possessed, without furnishing her with any standard of judgment or comparison. They were to her like the gorgeous fictions of the "Arabian Nights" to young readers, wonderful, exciting, but not supposed to be amenable to analysis or to the common rules of comprehension. Inexperience thus combined with a most remarkable simplicity of nature to stamp her character with some traits that were amusing, if not quite ridiculous, to more knowing mortals.</p> 
               <p>She had dwelt with perfect contentment in her own allotted sphere, and never even asked the question whether change could bring improvement; but lived on her own bough of the tree of life, until, like the chameleon, she assumed its very color. The confined theatre of her existence, and the unambitious current<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6274-00000027"/> of her thought, led her to measure by barleycorns what others did by feet or yards; thus she lived in a continual amazement at the prodigies enacted about her. Not in the least, however, did the wonder effect any derangement in her own orbit. Surprise exhaled in an ejaculation of "O my!" or "Did you ever!" and all was quiet again. The astounding fact was dismissed as a chance guest, that went its way and was thought of no more.</p> 
               <p>The widow had never, in the whole course of her life, felt the smallest impulse or entertained the most distant idea of wronging or defrauding any one; her nature did not contain the elements of mischief. Therefore, although even her limited experience proved the contrary, her instinctive and theoretic belief, or, more properly perhaps feeling, was that on one else would injure or deceive. She heard of crimes, and personally felt petty wrongs occasionally; but she wondered at and forgot them all. Thus afloat, without any definite appreciation of facts upon which to base conclusions, her credulity was unbounded; and her understanding objected to no demands upon it, except it were something too repulsive for feeling to credit. In fine, she was nearly passionless; and the temptations that misled others being unknown to her, their results of woe and wrong-doing were inconceivable; and to save herself the pain of condemning, she commonly refused to believe them. Her intellectual powers were not so much deficient as they were quiescent and inactive for want of all exciting impulse; and she never sought without her own bounds what was not found within them.</p> 
               <p>But in one point of view Mrs. Butler's character was far from weak or negative. A fact or a principle, once admitted, was fixed forever. In the circle of household and personal duty, she clearly comprehended and steadfastly practiced what she knew to be right and expedient. In the family, her laws were like those of the Medes and Persians; and to any encroachment upon the routine of her daily life, she would oppose a resolve as inflexible as that of the English bardons, when they replied to the demands of illicit power, "Nolumus leges Angli mutare." The mild, old lady would exhibit, indeed, a very different tone and manner from the iron-fisted feudatories; but she could be, on occasion, as persistent as the best of them. You might as easily persuade the wash-tubs and kettles to dance a polka, as to induce her to do anything in any way but what she thought the right one, or to leave undone anything that she conceived that economy or propriety called on her to do. In higher matters of conscience, she was equally scrupulous; and would have been more so, had the thing been possible. But with her, prejudices were as strong as principles, and habit as powerful as creed, for the simple reason that all were omnipotent. In all cases decided in the old lady's mind by either of these agencies, opposition was futile, logic and eloquence were vain. "What is right, is right," she would say; and this undeniable argument was to her a moral Gibraltar. Yet it was not that she was obstinate, in any bad sense of the word. It was not that her will was so strong, so much as that her conscientiousness was unenlightened, and therefore her power of discrimination weak.</p> 
               <p>A day or two after the occurrences we have already related, she was seated at a window, with her knitting work, revolving in her mind the events that had thus ruffled, for a time, the calm current of her life.</p> 
               <p>"How could Dobbin run away? How did I escape<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6274-00000028"/> without, breaking my neck?" Not finding any very obvious solution of her innocent wonderment, her thoughts diverged to the scapegrace Sam. "How can folks be so dreadful keerless? to let a nice pig like that get away!" This query being quite as insoluble as the others, the good dame reverted to the first problem, and then, in renewed despair, returned to the second once more. Dobbin and Sam both remaining as incomprehensible as ever, she finally settled down into a vacant and unresisting perplexity.</p> 
               <p>While the placid old lady dozed away her morning in these dreamy lucubrations, a young traveller was urging his horse towards Merrifield over the rough road that wound along the sea-coast from the westward, and shaped its sinuous course from point to point, across the heads of the bays which, running deep into the land at intervals of a few miles from each other, jagged its outline into a resemblance of a huge saw. The pace maintained by the young equestrian was rapid as was anywise practicable amid the obstacles and intricacies of the half-made track. Through the scattered stumps and stones, through the sloughs that frequently occurred where the brooks wound through the valley bottoms, he pushed on the animal which he rode, with hand and heel. The steady course was kept up, without a moment's check, up and down the heavy hills which traversed the path, running down from the interior and stretching far out into the ocean in shaggy promontories, which divided from each other the bays and roadsteads.</p> 
               <p>It was a lovely June morning. The brilliant sun shone with unbroken splendor through the clear, dry atmosphere; but there was no lassitude or enervation in his beams, for the north wind came fresh and bracing ing over the pine forests, from the Arctic regions where the chill of winter still lingered, and breathed into all nature a full and vigorous energy, as it merrily chased the light, fleecy cloudlets across the sky. It was one of those temperatures that make life, to the young and healthful, not only a pleasure but an irresistible challenge to active enjoyment, and send the sluggish current along more briskly, even in the veins of age.</p> 
               <p>James Butler-for the traveller was the widow's only son, returning from a four years' absence-seemed well qualified either to contend successfully with rougher circumstances or to enjoy fully the pleasant scene that now surrounded him. His clear calm, hazel eye, brown cheek, amiable but intelligent countenance, well-cut mouth and chin, denoted a character marked by that happy equipoise usually termed strong, practical common-sense. His frame, well developed and graceful, lacked the elements neither of strength nor activity; and a luxuriant mass of wavy dark hair, escaping beneath his cap, crowned an exterior that might well find favor with young or old. There was an indefinable air of prompt and efficient action about him, which strongly indicated that the fishing-rod, the rifle, and the saddle were all both agreeable and familiar to him; while the marked sagacity of his well-defined features forbade the suspicion of any lack of intellectual taste and culture.</p> 
               <p>Just over the brow of a hill, up whose long and steep slope he had been for some time climbing, a little spring welled out at the foot of a huge boulder by the roadside, under the deep shadow of several tall and dark hemlocks. A small clump of firs edged the track,-the full green of their fan-like masses of foliage<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6274-00000029"/> contrasting beautifully with the fresh olive tinge of the new shoots and the silvery reverse of their compact spray, as their branches tossed to the boisterous breeze. The delicious perfume peculiar to these trees, and which, like the odor of new-made hay, cannot be rivaled by the subtlest skill of the chemist, pervaded the bright air, as it oozed from the pores of the aromatic wood, forming those fragrant tears which give the plant its common title of fir balsam. Arrested by the exquisite scent that fell upon his senses, at once so delicate and so powerful, Butler checked his panting horse, and, springing from the saddle, gave the animal the rein at the edge of the little basin. While his faithful companion recovered breath and allayed his thirst in the fresh, cool water, his master cast a glance of comprehensive and pleased recognition upon the familiar prospect that lay before his eyes.</p> 
               <p>Immediately around and upon either side extended the high and rocky ridge on which he stood, stretching away northward into the forests, where, crowned with a dark growth of centuries, it melted away among the broken hills of the interior.</p> 
               <p>Under its northeastern slope, but chiefly hidden by high rolling swells that started out laterally from the main trunk, like the waves breaking along the wake of a huge sea-serpent, lay the valley of the Narraguagus River and the little village of Merrifield. Here and there a glimpse of the stream shining in the bright sun, or a clear field and homestead upon the opposite side of the valley, appeared through the tall gray stems of the dead trees, and the scattered clumps of bushes that still marked the site of the woods recently fallen before the axe and fires of the settlers. On the northern horizon, the twin summits of Humpback Mountain and the highlands on the Columbia River rose over the dense, unbroken mass of forest which spread uninterruptedly to the shores of the St. Lawrence. In front, another lofty and continuous ridge ran seaward, parallel with that on which he stood, on the further side of the river, and the bay into which it emptied four miles below, forming a bluff rampart to the high and broken table-land, which stretched away eastward, till it was intersected by the channel of the Pleasant or Columbia River and the estuary that welcomed its waters into the bosom of the Atlantic.</p> 
               <p>On the slopes of the hill a few houses of farmers and fishermen dotted its smoother swales with their little surrounding patches of cultivated ground; but its crest was still covered with the disheveled and straggling remnants of dark woods; except where, here and there, the huge granite backbone of the ridge bared itself in bleak and weather-beaten ledges, that glimmered piebald in eternal sterility, under the bright sunshine. In some spots where the fires had swept through, nothing was left but isolated gray trunks of pines, hemlocks, and spruces, standing bleaching in slow decay, like ghosts still lingering on the places, where their green life had perished. Around them, the surface was strown with an inextricable tangle of rotting trunks and broken branches. Roughs, gray boulders arose in every direction, revealing the hopeless and defiant barrenness that was once concealed beneath the dark canopy which Nature had slowly reared in the progress of centuries past, even from the iron bosom of its desolation. Now and then a little copse of birch bushes tossed its lithe branches to the breeze, relieving with patches of bright verdure the sombre expanse of the forbidding wilderness, the<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6274-00000030"/> effort of yet unexhausted Nature to repair the devastations that had invaded her domain.</p> 
               <p>To the north and west, rough and craggy mountains, partly clothed with shaggy woods, rose blue and huge in the interior, marking with their harsh outlines the general rough and indomitable nature of the country. Yet along the slopes of the long ridges that swept at right angles down towards the sea, and embosomed afar off among the towering mountains, were pleasant valleys and picturesque lakes and smiling water-courses, inviting the incoming of human life and civilization.</p> 
               <p>As Butler gazed upon the scene, his air of gratified familiarity sobered into a more serious expression. The reflections of the man began to modify the impulsive pleasure of boyish recollections.</p> 
               <p>"Well," thought he, "here is the river, and there the mountains, the hills, and the woods as they were four years ago; and my heart gushes out towards them with the affection of old acquaintanceship. But I must confess that I have somewhat flattered them, in the picture imprinted on my memory. Uncle John was not altogether unjustified when he ungraciously styled my childish paradise an unprofitable wilderness. Wilderness it most of it is, pretty surely; and as to the profit, the prospect is decidely brighter in Cornhill or on Long Wharf. I must admit, too, that some of the cultivated graces of the old homesteads in Massachusetts would decidedly improve the scenery. 'Sed non omnibus omnia,' as the old fellow said long time ago. Nature is too economical to spend all her treasures on one spot; and man has done little enough here, as yet.</p> 
               <p>"Well, the more room, then, for improvement. I need not rust out for want of occupation; and there are good things here as elsewhere. This country is grand and picturesque, if not rich and luxuriant. There are plenty of fish in the sea, trout in the brooks, and deer in the woods; and true-hearted men, and pretty girls too, in these rude log-houses.</p> 
               <p>"It seems to be hard, though, that experience leaves always disappointment behind. The more we know, the less we find worth bothering ourselves about. Knowledge strips the gilding and the flowers from our youthful idols, as the autumn winds strip the summer leaves from the trees. Is it meant that we shall never be satisfied with anything, in order to keep us always busy at our work? But, is there to be no play, no enjoyment, after it all? However, I can't stop longer to philosophize now."</p> 
               <p>Gathering up his reins and springing into the saddle. Butler urged his horse afresh down the rough and steep hill, over holes and sloughs and among stumps and stones that would have rendered the pace perilous, but for the activity of the animal, and the quick eye and ready hand of the rider. He crossed the short level of the table-hand that lay below, and, turning sharply to his left, struck into a track which led northward up the valley. On his right, the river, a shallow and rapid stream a few hundred feet wide, meandered along between shores, formed sometimes by abrupt banks scarped by the elements into the ribbed and furrowed slopes peculiar to a clayey soil, and sometimes by narrow marshes, niched into circuitous sweeps of upland. Part of the road was yet covered with the original forest; but, here and there, an opening, studded all over still with charred and decaying stumps, let in the broad sunlight upon the fields of settlers.<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6274-00000031"/> The recent clearings, with their rude buildings, had but little to gratify the eye, except the always stimulating presence of human life and the cheerful promises of industrious enterprise. The beginnings of infant settlements do little but destroy the wild magnificence and rich variety of the natural landscapes, without compensating their loss by the gentler graces of civilization, which are the work of long years of patient labor. The rough ground lies in charred and rotting ruin, while the influences of cultivation are scarcely perceptible. Yet these simple homes of future comfort, with their rude expedients and half wild outlines, are not devoid of a picturesque and negligent beauty.</p> 
               <p>As Butler dashed, almost at a single step of his horse, from the heavy shadows and gloomy atmosphere of the woods into the broad sunshine and fresh, sparkling air of these intervals, now growing more and more frequent, the change brought a sense of relief and pleasure. It was life and light instead of dim and death-like stillness; human cheer and activity for the stern and silent awe of the woods. He recalled to friendly recollection the owners of the older homesteads, and indulged in vague and rapid surmises as to the proprietorship of such recent improvements as were posterior to his departure from the neighborhood. But he did not stay to scrutinize or to question, but steadily maintained a pace that soon brought him to the little hamlet, clustered around the falls at the extreme limits of the flow of the tide.</p> 
               <p>The impatient youth speeded along, unpausing and almost regardless, past many familiar objects. Even at the corners of the bridge, where, according to their daily wont, all the quidnuncs of the village were collected, he stopped not to return, except by a hasty nod, the surprised recognition of some and the gaping curiosity of others, who failed to recall in the manly horseman the boy of four years ago. The deep affections of home were swelling in his Anglo-Saxon bosom; and he could not and would not draw his rein, till he flung himself from the saddle at the door of the house where he was born.</p> 
               <p>In a remote place, like Merrifield, so many miles from anywhere, in those days of circumscribed locomotion, the arrival of a stranger was an event of universal and paramount influence upon the usual monotony of every day. As a pebble which, falling into the ocean, is swallowed up unnoticed amid the surges of the mighty flood, creates, when thrown into a duck-pond, a commotion that circles ever widening to its utmost circumference, the sudden appearance of their young townsman at once set the whole community into a state of inexpressible excitement. Nothing more was done for the day, with many, but to speculate upon his appearance and the purposes of his return. But we shall leave the little public, as Butler did, to recover its usual dull equanimity at its leisure.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
               <p>BUTLER reined up his panting horse at the door-step, where the house-dog lay slumbering before the threshold. Old Watch lifted his head at the sudden intrusion, and uttered a loud and hurried bark, like a sentinel surprised at his post, and discharging his musket to announce unexpected danger. But, although her promptly rose upon his feet and stood sturdily between the new-comer and the door, he neither made any further demonstration of hostility nor repeated his angry challenge. A look of puzzled intelligence flashed over his honest face; and his half-joyous and half-suspicious expression showed that his canine brain was busy in the solution of an interesting question. The traveller stood for a moment, eying the shaggy quadruped with a silent smile; while the dog, in his turn, studied his features with a perplexed and earnest attention. Presently his tail began to twitch in incipient circles, as if considering the propriety of wagging a welcome; and the earnest gaze brightened and grew in intensity, as if his eyes would burst with their pent-up excitement. A low, tremulous whine expressive of his agitation at length overcoming the waiting quiet of his partner in the mute conference, the latter laid his hand upon the broad forehead which pressed up wards sympathetically to his touch, and spoke,-"Well, old playmate-do you remember me, or no?"</p> 
               <p>The question was solved, the laborious doubt was dissipated. The troubled eyes sparkled with unutterable joy, that exploded in one glad bark; the tail, no longer hesitating, swept the air, as if it would swing itself off from its roots, and the huge dog, rearing on his hind legs, laid his fore paws on either shoulder of the youth, and vented his overwhelming pleasure in a broken whine of immeasurable delight. Butler indulged the affectionate animal, for a moment, in his uncouth embrace; then, gently setting him down into his normal quadrupedal attitude, said with a moistened eye,-"We'll, have a long talk, presently, good old fellow."</p> 
               <p>Stopping only to give the bridle of his horse into one hand of a man who hurried forward from the barn, while he briefly shook the other hard and sunburnt fist thrust out to him in unceremonious but cordial welcome, he moved hastily towards the door.</p> 
               <p>His mother, now startled from the revery in which we left her immersed, toddled out to meet him, ejaculating, "O, forever! if it an't our James!"</p> 
               <p>Butler seized her extended hands, and kissing her on both cheeks with the ardor of an affectionate son, led her back to her chair.</p> 
               <p>"Well, only think of it! Why, James, where did you come from? O, I'm so glad to see you!" said his mother, her eyes twinkling through quiet tears with sudden pleasure. "Why, I never knew you were coming home now!"</p> 
               <p>"Of course you didn't, mother; for I thought it best not to write, for fear you should amuse yourself<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6274-00000033"/> with thinking that I should break my neck, or get drowned on the way, or be eaten up by the bears. So I stole a march upon you, and hope you are as glad to see me home again as I am to be here. You look well, dear mother's," added he, again kissing her cheek, as he led her to the old-fashioned arm-chair with its quilted cushion, and sat down by her side.</p> 
               <p>Dame Butler instinctively took up her knitting-work again and began to click the needles together, as if there was nothing but her unfinished stocking in the wide world. But her eyes soon wandered from the work to the face of her only child, whom she really loved with a deep affection, that in nobody but herself could have been at once so earnest and so undemonstrative.</p> 
               <p>"O my! how you are grown, James! I shouldn't have known you. You are as big as your father was,-only not so fat."</p> 
               <p>"Not quite, I think, mother,-I am not old enough to be fat, or a deacon yet," replied her son, laughing.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I hope you will live to be, James,-I mean a deacon,-I don't care about the fat; I like your looks very well as you are."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, mother. I mean to stay at home with you now; and perhaps I will try for the deaconship, if it will please you. But I am scarcely sober enough yet. But why don't you ask about Uncle John and all of them?"</p> 
               <p>"La, now, I forgot all about it. You've flustered me to death. How <emph>do</emph> they all do?"</p> 
               <p>"They are quite well, and send lots of love. Uncle says he will try to come down and see you next season. I wanted him to come with me, but he was too busy, as he always is."</p> 
                
               <p>"Well, did you say you were going to stay with us now, for good, my son?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, mother, if it suits you. I have tried city life long enough. Uncle John has been very kind, and makes generous offers; but I don't think it very important to make a large fortune. Do you mother?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I don't know,-some thinks so and some doesn't," oracularly replied she; for she would as soon have thought of solving the quadrature of the circle as the question proposed.</p> 
               <p>"We'll talk over my plans by and by, mother. I think you will let me do pretty much as I please. But what's the news in the village? You know I have been gone a long time."</p> 
               <p>"The news-dear me! You've put everything clear out of my head. Did I tell you about old Brindle's calf? I don't think I did-it was after I wrote my last letter, I believe; for I remember I was putting down my first butter the day I sent the letter. By the way, you haven't told me if you ever got it-I'm sure I don't see how anything ever gets safe, clear to Boston. Well, it's a nice calf. And Mrs. Campbell has got a little girl. They say it's a beautiful baby, but I haven't seen it. Then we've got a litter of pigs that's four weeks old next Wednesday. There's six of 'em. And old Mrs. Daighton has had the rheumatiz dreadfully-she hasn't been to meeting for a long time. They say her husband's built him a new barn too; but I haven't seen it, for I haven't been up that way this great while. Well, I declare I can't tell what <emph>has</emph> happened, I'm so dreadful glad to see you."</p> 
               <p>"Never mind, mother,-you'll think of it all in good time. But how are all the youngsters? How<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6274-00000034"/> are my old playmates, Archie Campbell, Harry Nichols, and the rest?"</p> 
               <p>"O, they're all well enough, I believe. But they do say some of 'em are shocking wild. Old Mrs. Small told me, only last week, that the young men went all round Saturday nights as much as any other night. I wonder what your father would have said! I don't believe he ever went anywhere of a Saturday night in all his born days, unless it was to a meeting. I don't know what folks'll do next."</p> 
               <p>"O mother, don't worry,-they'll grow steady fast enough. Old Mrs. Small is apt to know more about her neighbors' business than she needs to do. Isn't there anything less portentous that I should like to hears?"</p> 
               <p>His mother proceeded to enlighten young Butler upon the statistics of the village in an odd jumble of the details of her own household and the petty events that constitute the staple of gossip in sequestered communities; among which figured conspicuously the particulars of all the maladies that had afflicted Merrifield for an indefinite period of its history. Measles and whooping-coughs, fevers and dysenteries, were described with a minuteness to furnish materials for a complete sanitary report. Occasional digressions upon pigs and poultry, and spinning and weaving operations, filled up the sketch of the old lady's reminiscences. To all these matters her auditor listened with an air of indifference, as if respect for the narrator alone prevented the avowal of their lack of importance in his eyes. Still, with apparent inconsistency, he continued to provoke by questions the occasionally interrupted flow of the narrative. Perhaps James's notions was that it afforded pleasure to his mother; perhaps he hoped that some yet untold matter of deeper interest might be forthcoming among the motley groupings of the matron's memory. However this might be, the listless air of unconcern that had settled upon his features, in spite of him, was superseded by an expression of trifling awkwardness, as he finally interrupted a rsum of a case of consumption that might have have made the reputation of a young dispensary physician, by an abrupt question that showed a sad want of sympathy.</p> 
               <p>"Well, mother, I'm no doctor, neither do I desire to be one. But you said awhile ago that old Mrs. Small thought the boys were in a bad way: how is it with the girls? are they all dead or married?"</p> 
               <p>"I rather think not, my son," replied the old lady smiling, as she looked over her spectacles at James. Now, if she had looked <emph>through</emph> her spectacles, she might have seen that a slight flush spread over his cheeks in answer to her smile. But those useful auxiliaries had been dropped half-way down her nose, as she sat at her knitting, and she did not observe it. But, in reply, she started off in a rambling commentary upon numbers of James and Hannahs, Elviras, Sarahs, and Deborahs, even including the matrimonial fortunes of a pretty young squaw among the aristocracy of the neighboring tribe of Passamaquoddies, whose wedding had lately been celebrated in the neighborhood, according to aboriginal ritual. But, although he had himself sought the information, it seemed all to fall upon James's ears with as little effect as the catnip teas, and decoctions of liverwort. The dame came once more to a stand, as if the romantic elements of Merrifield annals were exhausted. After a short pause, she added, by way of epilogue to the record of<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6274-00000035"/> the Court of Love, "They say Polly Wood spun more yarn last winter than any two girls in Merrifield. I won't undertake to say how many hanks it was."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, mother!" observed the young man, rather coolly; and bending down his head, because he was very much occupied in playing with the old pussy's ears, just then, he added, "But where's Mary Wilmot, mother? You say nothing about her."</p> 
               <p>This little interrogatory came out of James's throat very much as the potato was snaps out of a boy's popgun. Mrs. Butler's damsel, who was busy at the other end of the room about household affairs, but had not thought it necessary rigidly to close her ears to the conversation, shrugged her shoulders slightly, and, having her back to the interlocutors, further indulged in a decided smile. The widow, however, taking no heed of the manner in which the question was asked, replied to it: "O! Mary Wilmot's been away at an uncle's, that lives somewhere on the Kennebec, for nearly a year. That's why I never thought of her, I suppose. They say she is going to marry a young minister there."</p> 
               <p>The spectacles were still off duty, and Mrs. Buttler, moreover, very intent upon her knitting. James, too, was busier than ever with the cat's ears, and his head dropped even lower than before. The maiden across the room shrugged her shoulders again, but she did not smile. James made no direct reply, and grew very sententious and brief, till his mother had the conversation pretty much to herself. This seemed to make little difference to her. She rambled on, stringing together all sorts of matters, as they came to hand. At last, perceiving that her son's attention flagged, she rose to overlook the preparations for dinner.</p> 
                
               <p>"I suppose these matters don't seem much to you, James, after living so long in Boston."</p> 
               <p>James made no answer to the implied question, but took up his cap, saying that he would walk round and take a look at the farm before dinner.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
               <p>WE have already said that Butler had been long absent from the village where his childhood had passed. His father had died several years before, and his mother gladly accepted the kind offer of her brother, a merchant of note in Boston, to receive young James into his family and business also at a future day. It pained the widow to part with her only child, but the advantage to her son's education and prospects was not to be overlooked. She therefore dispatched him for a journey which, in the state of the country then, was a matter of no small moment, especially to her mind.</p> 
               <p>For four years, James had remained with his uncle. Two of them were devoted to completing his studies, which had necessarily been limited and desultory, and the other two spent in the counting-room of his relation, and in reading and the investigation of such matters as arrested his attention. He had left his home a strong, manly, and energetic boy, but rather behindhand in mere scholastic attainments, but perhaps little the worse for that.</p> 
               <p>The want of the drill usually bestowed on children in preparatory schools is, after all, no great loss, at least to strong and active intellects. Give a promising boy sufficient early instruction to enable him to read, to calculate, and think for himself, and you will have done for him all that would be absolutely necessary, and most that will be especially profitable, until the mind matures sufficiently to appreciate, for itself, the value of information and the use of principles. Except in rare cases, a child cannot be expected to be an earnest student, and very many of the exceptions to the general rule prove to be unfortunate. To the active, healthy child, the lesson cannot fail to be literally a task, whose meaning and real purpose he does not comprehend. It is a burden antagonistic to the instincts and physical necessities of his being. Nature says, "Go play, and grow healthy, robust, and active. Go to and fit yourself for the common toils of manhood. Go and learn the external features at least of the world in which you are to live and of the materials with which you are to deal."</p> 
               <p>But father and fashion say, "Go to school, study, learn; if you do not, you can never be anything." Now father and fashion are right, in a measure. Knowledge and education are the great means of happiness and success. But there is still an open question of the modes, the times, and the degrees. All education is not to be got in schools, nor all knowledge from books. The first requisites of humanity are health and strength. Without these, accomplishments had acquirements are unsatisfactory to their possessor, and comparatively useless to the world. The mind is even often dwarfed and blunted by this premature discipline, as well as dragged down and enfeebled by its sympathy with puny and diseased frames.</p> 
               <p>Let children learn to read, and more if they will. But let them have plenty of play and light work suited to their years. Be they boy or girl, let them walk, ride, swim, skate, and mix with all that is going on<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6274-00000037"/> about them. Then, at twelve or thirteen years of age, you will have a foundation, intellectual, moral, and physical, upon which to form a true, useful, and efficient man or woman.</p> 
               <p>James Butler was a favorable illustration of this fact. His clear mind soon mastered the very moderate amount of school instruction attainable at Merrifield. His spare time and energies were expended in hunting, fishing, riding, and intelligent observation of men and things. To some, such a course of life might have had its dangers; but he left his home, for the metropolis of New England, an energetic, high-minded, and keen-sighted lad, ready for any exertion of mind or body. He rapidly acquired at the academy the formulas of elementary knowledge, and in the period passed in the counting-room he applied them sagaciously and successfully to practice; employing also his leisure hours in a diligent course of general reading. He thus returned home, at the age of twenty-two, and able and well-informed man. Indeed, his acquirements might bear favorable comparison with any but proficients in a finished course of classical studies. In that early day, there were few who attempted an education so ambitious. Unless intended for the learned professions as the business of their lives, the youths of the time were seldom able or willing to meet the expenditure and trouble. The exigencies of a new country called them early into the active duties of life.</p> 
               <p>Thus, James, imperfect as this way training might now be considered, was fitted amply to follow the promptings of an active mind in the successful maintenance of a leading party in society.</p> 
               <p>It may be seriously doubted whether a carefully finished and elaborated culture is, altogether, the best mode of obtaining "assurance of a man,"-a man fitted to grapple with circumstances and fulfil the heavy tasks of time. It gives the delicate edge and temper of Saladin's scimetar, rather than the downright and stalwart sweep of the sword of the Lion Heart. To the systematic scholar, to the professional and scientific man, it is essential; to the European classes of hereditary wealth and ease, it is an appropriate and becoming ornament. But, in the common course of our more democratic experience, there are more iron bars than down cushions to be dealt withal. However this abstruse point may be settled, Dame Butler looked upon her son with a pride and affection that could not very well admit of increase. His acquirements and experience, moderate through they might be, transcended all her means of comparison, so that they were, to all intents and purposes, infinite to her. From the time of his return, the sceptre passed from the hands of Deacon Hardy to those of its legitimate heir in the household. Out-of-doors, too, Jame's influence soon superseded, to a great extent, the ascetic and unpopular ascendency of that ungenial dignitary.</p> 
               <p>None of these speculations, however, occupied James's mind, as he proceeded on his walk. Although he had professed the natural desire to look round upon the well-remembered scenes of his childhood once more, his curiosity appeared to be easily appeased. He paused a moment on the step cast a hasty glance upon the village and the little river, and then, turning short to the rear of the house, hurried off through the fields and pastures towards the high ridge that bounded the valley on its western side, stretching its massive length along till it terminated in the cliffs of a rocky promontory on the sea-coast. His rapid steps soon<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6274-00000038"/> carried him, through the little belt of cultivation that surrounded the village, into a desolate region, where the natural growth had fallen before the fires kindled to clear the farming lands, without being replaced by the tamer and softer beauties of a landscape improved by human industry. The bald ledges on the summits gleamed out, barren and dreary, and stripped of the mossy carpet and the withered leaves that had once partly concealed their sterile ugliness. The wreck of the forest, that once covered the rough ground, lay prostrate around in all stages of decay; forming a labyrinth of ruin, black with the uneffaced marks of the destroying element, or bleaching beneath the sunshine and the storm. Here and there, among these wasting skeletons, a tall trunk still rose, withered and branch-less, lone sentinel above its fallen comrades. Occasionally a swamp relieved the utter barrenness of the scene with a patch of verdure, where alder-bushes were interspersed with straggling trees that still 'maintained a miserable and blighted vegetation. It was, as it were, the grave-yard of the native forest,-such as may be seen in the vicinity of all new settlements, smutty dank, inhospitable, and cheerless.</p> 
               <p>The melancholy landscape had one redeeming feature; the destruction of the trees had laid open a wide prospect to the southward, and the distant Atlantic glistened in the bright sunshine. The harbor at the river's mouth was distinctly seen through the clear atmosphere, with its little fleet of coasting vessels lying at anchor, and the white sails of fishing-boats skimming over the bay, among islands clothed with dark spruces. On one side, lay the valley of the Narraguagus with the rude dwellings scattered up and down its banks. Elsewhere, the deep fringe of forest bordered the view, with the blue hills and craggy mountains rising all around from its unbroken sea of green.</p> 
               <p>James seated himself upon a fallen trunk; and the old house-dog, who had been anxiously awaiting his reappearance, ever since their short colloquy in the morning, and had escorted his steps with gambols of overrunning happiness, lay down quietly in front of him,-his head nestled upon his master's feet, except when it was raised now and then with a look of deep content, as if to reassure himself that the sudden restoration of his old playmate was not the illusion of a dream.</p> 
               <p>Butler gazed for a moment upon the familiar scene; his own reflections then seemed to take complete possession of his mind; and though he looked listlessly over the prospect, he saw nothing but what lay in his own heart.</p> 
               <p>He had carried with him to the far-off city fond recollections of the woods and lakes, the rivers and mountains of his rugged but picturesque birthplace. In a sacred and warm corner of his memory too, the image of a fair and graceful girl, his favorite playmate in childhood and the idol of the dawning passions of his youth, had accompanied him in his pilgrimage. The busy and brilliant scenes of the town had failed to wean him from his love of the rough grandeur and romantic beauty of his native valley; and the polished belles of the metropolis never superseded in his fancy the image of the frank and cordial girl that had been the romance of his early life. For he was one of those who make their own world; and impassive to the distraction of passing objects, adhere tenaciously to everything once intimately associated with their life. When he determined to give up the hopes of wealth<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6274-00000039"/> and social distinction held out to his ambition in the busy world, for the simple pleasures of his secluded home, it was the bright memory of Mary Wilmot that shed the golden sunshine over his anticipations. Her well-remembered form seemed to beckon him back to spend his life in unaspiring content among the scenes of his childhood. In the bashful timidity of deep feeling he had lured his mother on through her rambling reminiscences, in the vain expectation of hearing of her-unaltered in herself, unchanged to him.</p> 
               <p>When, in answer to his reluctant question, he heard the brief but decisive fact that she was absent and had given herself to another, the revulsion of his feelings was painful and bitter. He had turned his back upon flowery paths and bright prospects, to find the charmed retreat of contented love which his fancy had framed, the life-long home of his affections, blighted by a withering frost that turned all its beautiful blossoms of hope into black despair. He had pushed his journey homeward with eager haste. Overtaken by night, some dozen miles from Merrifield, he had scarcely closed his eyes; and early dawn found him in the saddle, speeding to his goal. The familiar landscape shone bright to his vision in the glad June morning; and happy associations shed a light about his more cheering than that of the summer day. But now his spirit was darkened, and it seemed as if a dull leaden cloud had overspread the smiling scene.</p> 
               <p>He pondered gloomily over the sudden chill that had struck him to the heart. The old dog raised himself from to time to lick his hand in disconsolate but vague sympathy with his moody silence; and laid down again in quiet disappointment, as he missed the usual acknowledgment of his faithful affection.</p> 
                
               <p>"What a fool was I,"-murmured Butler to himself,-"to suppose that, because I had never forgotten her, she must necessarily have treasured me in her heart. Perhaps she never thought again of our childish friendship, or thought of it only as a pleasant pastime, that had gone by and served its turn. And now she is to marry a long-faced, white-cravated parson!-a nice sort of a rival! Well, I have nothing to do but to forget too. If I find it too hard work, I'll go back to Boston, make a fortune and marry some Washington Street beauty. They're to be had for a price, like everything else. If I cannot venture on my personal merits, I can buy a wife 'to order. "With this ingeniously contrived revenge, he fancied himself somewhat comforted. As he looked up, poor Watch lifted his own head once more, and silently licking his hand, gazed, with a look of anxious love that yearned to be recognized, into his face. The youth smiled, though somewhat bitterly, upon his humble companion, and kindly patted his shaggy head.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, good old Watch, you didn't forget me, did you! Because you're only a dog, I suppose, and not a man or a woman. How many of us are as disinterested and true as you?"</p> 
               <p>So he rose from his seat, jerked a stone at a squirrel that was rambling about among the brushwood, and consulting his watch, found that dinner would be ready by the time he should reach home. His companion, rejoiced at the dispersal of the cloud, gamboled joyfully along at his side, and they turned their steps toward the house again.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
               <p>BUTLER was candid and generous, though clearheaded and shrewd. He saw plainly the deficiencies and imperfections around him; but he had too much good feeling and high impulse, to be either morose and ascetic, or selfish and exacting. He knew his own rights and interests, but he was neither bitter at encroachment or denial of them, nor overbearing or egotistic in their assertion. His sympathies were too strong to allow him to be unkind, and his sense of right too great to permit him to be unjust. He was not unimaginative, and he was moderately sanguine; and therefore more inclined to overrate than to depreciate what he could find of good. It was easier for him to be amiable than censorious; though not from lack of acute discrimination. His heart revolted from intentional wrong, and his intellect scorned it as a meanness that insulted his self-respect. Deeply as he felt the capriciousness of Mary Wilmot, he did not attempt to resent it seriously, though, his self-love could not but be deeply wounded. She had been throned in his memory as a queen, invested with all her own real worth, and all the impossible perfections of a lover's fancy. Though she was his no longer, he was loyal still. Though compelled to relinquish her, he found no satisfaction in depreciating her merits, or disparaging her conduct. His boyish fancy had strength sufficient to survive a long separation, during which, it had perhaps been increased by the power of association and imagination,-those potent influences having never been diverted to any new object of attraction. Still there was in the predilection, pure and generous and unbroken as it was, none of the vehemence of maturer passion; and its disappointment brought with it none of the bitterness of a sterner mood. It would have readily developed into fierce heat, but it had not yet done so; and was still but the milder glow of youthful fancy. Butler moreover concluded within himself that his chances might not yet be desperate. The information might be incorrect, and an allowable vanity whispered that Mary Wilmot might have more taste and discrimination than she had been credited with. His buoyancy revived as he approached home; and as he looked down the long, rough slopes that led to the river and the village streets that ran along its banks, he felt ready almost to stop and shake hands with every straggling tree, and smile his recognition upon every stump upon the well-remembered ground. At last, he wound up with a race and a romp with old Watch, as boisterous and merry as in the childish days gone by.</p> 
               <p>"How strange," thought he, "are some of our feelings! Why should I look upon this half-savage landscape, and this dull little village with such a boyish delight, for which I could not give a respectable reason, if I should die for it? And yet, after all, why need there be any reason at all about it? It's my home, and it suits me; and why not? There's something in us better than reason; and it's lucky for us that it's stronger too, or life would be about as interesting as one of Uncle John's russia-backed ledgers. This is my<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6274-00000041"/> home and that's my house, and in it is my dear good old mother. There's no syllogism in Aristotle comes to a conclusion half so convincing as that."</p> 
               <p>This scrap of philosophy brought James to his own door. After a gentle reproach from his mother on the score of jeopardizing by tardiness the perfection of her culinary labors, he sat down with a light and grateful heart at the old-fashioned mahogany table, that had been in his young eyes at once a wonder and a daily joy. The subsidiary accompaniments of his claw-footed friend, were equally familiar and equally dear. There were the old china plates with their grotesque jumble of a pattern, where boats and bridges, trees, rivers, and clouds were combined in a manner that no one ever could have devised but that same Chinaman with the umbrella hat and pig-tail, that stood on one shore of the river, as tall as the pagoda at his elbow; with his feet at the foot of a hill, and his head in the clouds above it. There was the old fat-bellied little silver teapot, with the nose sticking out one way, and the handle rounded out on the other; looking, on its straddling legs, like a corpulent hen running after a grasshopper. Old and long-valued acquaintances were these, as well as their companion utensils of minor pretensions. The benign, placid, and affectionate face, that smiled on him as of yore across the table, all these young Butler would not have exchanged for a monarch's board, or for more than regal magnificence. Indeed, he would have been very ungrateful to have been less than content; for infinite had been the commotion caused by his unexpected arrival, in the quiet little household. His mother had spent the livelong morning, with her zealous coadjutor, in emulous diligence to expand the noon-day meal into a style and pretension worthy of the joyful occasion. Cupboards had been ransacked; and preserve-pots, with all other treasure-houses of extraordinary luxury, had contributed to the entertainment. In new countries, people cannot often obtain just what they please, and are obliged to take things somewhat as they happen to come. The delicate distinctions and nice etiquette of fashionable gourmandism might have been shocked at the widow's dinner-table. Yet it was, as the good lady flattered herself, excellent in kind, and abundant in quantity and variety. To fastidious and highly trained tastes it might have seemed too multifarious and indiscriminate. There were the pair of fat roasted partridges, plump and fragrant with the flavor of wild berries and tender buds, the rich and succulent steaks of venison, and the delicious salmon trout, fresh and pure to the taste as the mountain brook where they grew, and fried to the very perfection of crispy brown. To these fundamental elements of the feast, the hospitable matron had added a host of pies, cakes, and doughnuts and fritters, with cheese, butter, preserves of strawberry, cranberry, blackberry, and raspberry, each in its separated saucer, as if it were a world's fair of culinary art, as practiced in that forest neighborhood. The mantling steam of the delicate infusion of tea poured out its fragrance from the hen-like silver pot, and rich cream and snowy sugar stood ready to enhance and mellow its exquisite flavor.</p> 
               <p>With pride and pleasure the widow surveyed her crowded board, as her darling son placed himself once more in his father's chair at its side. Had her resources comprised as much more, it would, as like as not, have been added to this avalanche of dainties.</p> 
               <p>In the earlier days of New England, wholesome and<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6274-00000042"/> palatable viands were more plentiful than formal courtesies, elaborate elegancies, or splendid apparatus. The warm-hearted housewives of that day were led, therefore, to express their good-will to visitors in the form most palpable to their simple habits of thought and life; and the extent of the welcome was indicated, in some measure, by the profusion of hospitable preparation.</p> 
               <p>Too happy herself to eat, Mrs. Butler devoted herself to piling portion after portion upon her son's plate, chiding him gently for not eating, wondering that he had no appetite, and pressing upon him, in due succession, every dish of her profuse banquet.</p> 
               <p>Youthful appetite and recent exercise enabled her son to do admirable credit to the cookery. But, at last, after playing with the various relays of preserves, cakes, and other condiments, which the widow seemed to think might be insinuated into a full stomach,-as the sailor crams what he calls dunnage into the crevices and interstices of his lading,-he was compelled to make a formal protest of his inability to dispose of another mouthful.</p> 
               <p>"Why, dear mother, I should think you supposed that I had gone hungry for a week past, and was in danger of getting no more for a week to come. You must really save the rest for another time."</p> 
               <p>At this moment, his mother's officious kindness was interrupted by a knock at the door, followed immediately by the appearance of Deacon Hardy; who had dropped in, as he came by from his own noonday meal, to welcome Butler home, and also to satisfy some little private ends of his own.</p> 
               <p>The Deacon shook hands with cordial warmth; for he liked James, as everybody did that knew him. The worthy functionary also regarded him as a sort of unliquidated assets of the church-sanctioned copartnery dissolved by the death of his father. In this light, the Deacon felt a personal responsibility as surviving partner, to whose care all unfinished business naturally devolved. His universal propensity to dictation and control over everything within his reach, together with an unquestionably real interest in his self-adopted ward, was further much increased by the idea that his own importance and influence were amplified and extended in young Butler's person. To be the family friend and informal guardian of the estates of his deceased coadjutor was a feather for the cap, even of so great a man as the living dignitary. He was also prompted to this early visit by two additional motives.</p> 
               <p>During James' boyhood, Hardy had maintained a precarious authority in the household; supported on one side by his own really friendly, though obstinately officious zeal, and often thwarted on the other by the natural independence of the boy, backed by the indulgence of a fond mother for an only child. He desired now to ascertain the probable extent of his future control over James' opinions and movements; and he was in a perfect fever of anxiety to remedy what he chose to consider a great mistake of the widow in her donation to Sam Shirk. The latter transaction he hoped to place on what he considered a more prudent footing, by inducing Butler's interference in the matter. The economical relations of the case were so obvious and so controlling, in his mind, that he did not doubt that James would immediately decide to revoke or greatly modify his mother's gift,-the way to such a course of action having been opened by Sam himself in the careless destruction of the deed, which had not<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6274-00000043"/> yet been replaced. This transaction of Shirk's with Jem Sharpe, had been made known to the Deacon by his vexed patroness; and was sufficient to ruin his reputation with the shrewd and minute man of business, if indeed he had had any reputation with him to lose.</p> 
               <p>Before entering upon business, however, Deacon Hardy, for his own private satisfaction, took a cool and deliberate survey of James himself.</p> 
               <p>Seating himself in a chair and planting his cane between his feet, he rested both hands upon its ivory head, and inspected his young friend minutely from top to toe. James winced and colored for a moment under the cool and undisguised scrutiny; for the old man examined him precisely as he would an ox in his barnyard, or a fatting hog in his own stye. Why shouldn't he? He, Deacon Hardy, had an opinion to make up on his behalf, and how else should he do it?</p> 
               <p>The Deacon was a horrible egoist, in truth. Too strong minded to be vulgarly conceited, he had still an implicit confidence in his own conclusions. Had he worn a crown, he would have said with Louis, le grand Monarque,-"The State! that's me."</p> 
               <p>Luckily for his neighbors, his power was limited, if his arrogance was not. Yet the old fellow would not have been an unprincipled tyrant; though in many cases he might have been a tyrant upon principle. He said and did nothing, but on long and often painful consideration, and upon fore-ordained convictions that had become an integral part of his moral beings; and he could not conceive of a sane man coming to any results differing from his own. He was, to do him justice, generally sagacious in his deductions; but he could not understand that men must necessarily differ in their judgments and opinions. The proverb, "So many men, so many minds," was flat heresy with him. He denied the right of private judgment to his fellows, as coolly and as resolutely as the Pope. He was therefore amazed, some twenty times a day, on an average, at the incredible folly and obstinacy of such as could not see through his spectacles. Still, he went on, day after day, interfering, advising, and dictating for the good of his neighbors, with the perseverance of a martyr; for he would really do good, if he could without any great sacrifice to himself; and he hated to see anything go wrong or run to waste, especially under his own nose and in defiance of his own opinion.</p> 
               <p>When he came to explain his views upon the matter of Sam Shirk, he was grievously disappointed at the reception they met with. In vain he recounted all the peccadilloes of which Sam had been guilty, as well as some of which he probably did not deserve the credit. Sam's character was one of those, whose very virtues often wore the grab of genial foibles at best, in the eye of severe criticism, and were even sins to a man like Hardy; while his faults admitted a wide latitude of construction, between the half-approving pity of charity, and the stern condemnation of formal censoriousness. His case was now in the hands of a harsh critic, and was made out unsparingly black and unpromising against him. But Butler knew both the accuser and the accused, and listened with respectful indifference; until, when the Deacon, having exhausted his eloquence, culminated his harangue with his favorite depreciatory proverb, that "silk purses couldn't be made out of sows' ears," he laughed outright.</p> 
               <p>The Deacon enforced his closing argument with a sturdy thump upon the floor with his stick; and sat<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6274-00000044"/> resting his chin between his hands, upon the head of his cane, as if he were planting himself in a position that only a fool or a madman would dream of attacking.</p> 
               <p>At Butler's irreverent treatment of his final apothegm, he started, and drawing up his head, visited the youth with a look such as a Pythian priestess might have bestowed on the impious heathen who should have ridiculed the Delphic oracle.</p> 
               <p>Before either could speak, the simple-minded dame replied to his concluding observation: "Well, to be sure, nobody could make silk purses out of sows' ears, and I shouldn't want to try. But, Deacon, three years ago I bought a little pig, and it was the meanest runt of a pig that you ever saw. But I couldn't get any better; for I remember that somehow pigs were awful skerce that season. Everybody said it wan't worth bringing up; but I couldn't bear to see all the slops going to waste, so I tried what I could make of him. I dare say I took extra pains, because he was such a miserable creature. Well, he grew and did first-rate after all; and when I had him killed, he was about as handsome a hog as ever we had. I don't justly recollect what he weighed; but he was a noble hog, and better pork I never put down in a barrel."</p> 
               <p>The widow paused in pleased reminiscence of the exemplary pig. James caught the drift of his mother's apologue and smiled again. The Deacon sat in sullen dignity, though ruffled by his evident defeat. Wellington, when he saw the squadrons of Napoleon charge and break, for the last time, on his unfaltering squares, could not have looked more proudly. He was always as proud in defeat as in victory. For while he considered success but as the natural sequence of presupposed infallibility, failure was at once proof of the perversity of his opponents and the glorious crown of the martyr to unappreciated truth.</p> 
               <p>So all three sat silent for a minute or two: the good old lady in placid meditation, her son in the mood commonly denominated sniggering, and the Deacon, severe and undismayed, if discomfited. He listened to the story of the pig, with that impassive quiet which so happily combines the expression of respect for the speaker with profound contempt for the speech. As the silence began to grow oppressive, he ejaculated a pettish, "Well," which might either be interpreted, "What of all that?"-or in the milder sense of, "Yes, yes, no doubt, but what about the matter we were speaking of?"</p> 
               <p>The widow, recalled by his voice from the grave of the departed porker, reechoed the exclamation,-</p> 
               <p>"Well, I mean to say that I think Sam may be more like that runt than like sows' ears. Maybe he'll grow good for something, when he has the chance."</p> 
               <p>The Deacon looked at her with an expression of grave dissent, and shook his head, but said not a word. Turning again to James he saw by the expression of his face, that he had no hopes of success; and again he summed up his internal reflections with the same "Well."</p> 
               <p>What a blessed word is that little compound of four letters! It means everything and it means nothing at all. It is sufficient to let off any quantity of accumulated wrath or any amount of contempt, yet leaves no room for quarrel. Most felicitously ambiguous, it means one thing to the speaker and another to the hearer, being understood by each in his own way.</p> 
               <p>"Well, well," says Smith, meaning thereby, "If<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6274-00000045"/> you're fool enough to think so, think so, and be hanged!" His friend Jones translates it: "I an't sure that I agree, but I shan't dispute with a gentleman of your intelligence."</p> 
               <p>Brown considers his "Well, well," to mean, "You are such an as that it's of no use to argue with you;" while the ass takes it to express, virtually, "Probably you know best; but I never saw it in that way before."</p> 
               <p>Better than all the Peace Societies, Presidents, Secretaries, Committees and all, is this little polite, hypocritical monosyllable. Like the finished man of the world, it can flatter or insult, cajole or sneer, all in a breath, and all with imperturbable serenity.</p> 
               <p>Under cover of this friendly mystery, the Deacon exhaled his indignation; and the dame expressed her determination to have her own way.</p> 
               <p>James, too, said to himself, "Well, I guess mother's about right;"-and in consummation of the whole matter subjoined also mentally,-</p> 
               <p>"Well, the old deacon meant right enough too but he's a quiddle."</p> 
               <p>So all was well,-Sam Shirk's cause included.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head> 
               <p>AT the conclusion of Deacon Hardy's call, or reconnoissance, as it might be considered, James felt something of that mental oppression which the bustle and hurry of excited feeling leave behind them. The natural disposition for solitary and quiet reflection which a plunge into a new scene, calling up numerous associations and awakening deep emotions, always induces, also coperated with physical weariness to produce the same effect.</p> 
               <p>He therefore proposed to go to his chamber for an hour's rest. His mother was sitting motionless in her chair too much absorbed even to knit, not precisely in reflection, but in what she would herself have called a mismaze. Her heart had borne her triumphantly through the dispute with the Deacon; but now her mind was painfully going over the ground again, in a conscientious endeavor to comprehend the real merits of the case. Like an officer who, after a fiery charge which had swept his enemy like chaff before him, returning leisurely over the disputed ground and making his way among mangled corpses and mutilated sufferers, feels the current of his ideas changed by the melancholy accompaniments of his triumph, and begins to question the fierce excitement and the proud joy of victory,-the good lady was sorely perplexed by a scrupulous fear, lest she had, unwittingly, in the heat<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6274-00000046"/> of discussion, deviated from the straight and narrow path of duty. She felt she was right, but could not for her life tell why; and it was equally dark to her how the Deacon was, or could be wrong. There was no particle of logic in her composition; and the more she thought about the matter, the more she worked herself into a desperate and despairing worry. Her son easily guessed what was going on in her mind; and taking her hand affectionately, said with a quiet smile,-"Now, dear mother, don't trouble yourself any more about that. I will take it all off your hands, and settle it according both to law and gospel."</p> 
               <p>"O, dear me, do James." The shadow passed away, and the placid contentment came over the old lady's kindly face, as when a cloud blows over and lets the sunshine in again upon the landscape. She was delighted to be relieved of all further necessity for thought or care; and it was doubly delightful to throw her burden on the manly shoulders of her own handsome, open-hearted boy, instead of her old ghostly father confessor, the stiff, captious, and awful Deacon.</p> 
               <p>"Now mother, you just take a little afternoon nap. I mean to do the same myself," continued James, "for I feel a trifle tired. I did not stop much upon my road home, and an hour's sleep will not be amiss."</p> 
               <p>The good dame now found a new and more congenial subject for her ideas to ramble over, in anxiety for her son's health; and she forthwith urged him to stop till she could make for him a cup of herb tea, the materials for which she kept constantly at hand and which was, in her belief, a sure prophylactic against colds, nervousness, fatigue, and most mortal ills.</p> 
               <p>James however declined the herb tea, pleading a need of nothing but a little rest;-and kissing his mother's cheek, turned to leave the room.</p> 
                
               <p>"Well, my son, have a good nap. We will call you for tea. And, James, won't it be better for you to see Deacon Hardy again about Sam?" added she; for she could not yet entirely divest herself of the sense of responsibility in acting without the approval of a man to whose opinion she had so long yielded implicit deference.</p> 
               <p>"O yes, mother, I shall see the Deacon twenty times a day, you know," replied James evasively. But, for his part, although he did not think it worth while to say so, he had determined that the Deacon should have nothing more to do with it.</p> 
               <p>So saying, he went up the narrow staircase which led to the little attic chamber which had been always called his own. As he entered the small room, with its low ceiling and plain plastered walls, and simple furniture, the contrast with the spacious apartments and handsome appurtenances of the city mansions, with which he had so long been familiar, struck him momentarily with a disagreeable impression of insignificance and discomfort. But when, after drawing off his boots, he stretched himself upon the fresh, clean, snow-white bed and leisurely looked around the room, a more truthful and healthy feeling came over him, refreshing to his spirit as the cool, soft June breeze that poured in at the windows was to his tired and somewhat fevered frame. In the recognition of objects so familiar, though at first half strange from long absence, memory and affection supplied what experience and taste found lacking. In the corner still stood his fishing-rod and gun, with the shot-pouch and powder-flask hanging from the head of the ramrod, just as he had left them. His inkstand, pencils, and two or three favorite books, lay upon the little<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6274-00000047"/> round claw-footed table in the middle of the floor, seeming, except from their scrupulous order and neat array, as if they had waited for the four long years in daily expectation of their owner's return. The little library of his boyhood stood in regular and carefully dusted rows upon the shelves; and everything bore the marks of fond care and unforgotten associations with an absent loved one. In truth, on every Saturday morning, his mother had for every week through out his protracted absence, religiously climbed the stairs "to set James' room to rights," or, in other words, to put in order what was already and always perfectly so. But she was wont, on these hebdomadal visits, to dust and carefully replace every article, to arrange and rearrange, until ingenuity was at fault to find a pretext for further industry. Then the old lady would often seat herself upon one of the little straight-backed chairs and think dreamily of her distant and darling boy, oblivious of fatigue and of everything but her fond recollections, till summoned to dinner by her handmaiden. And, if the door of the little closet by the side of the chimney had been open, James might have seen the wardrobe he had cast off, when fitted out for his momentous journey to the metropolis, carefully hung upon the pegs and garlanded with white cedar sprigs to keep the moths away, altogether regardless of the evident fact that it was a thing obsolete and forever useless. But the soft-hearted mother could not spare even a rag that reminded her of the child so far away; and she cherished and guarded with zealous care the smallest and meanest thing that could recall the rosy-cheeked and curly-headed urchin, whom she had so often laid to sleep in this little chamber, after listening to the childish ish prayer repeated at her knee. The maternal instinct in a bosom like her's is like the unreasoning zeal of the devote, who sees every wretched bit of ribbon and paltry candle-end adorning the shrine of her favorite saint all gilded with the light of her own unlimited devotion; and finds a reverent and unbounded delight in arranging the valueless offerings, as if they were pearls of price.</p> 
               <p>These silent evidences of love, pure and unstinting, if unregulated by logic or wordly limitations, moved the heart of the returned wanderer; and a tear stood in his eye, as he murmured a blessing on his mother, and his humble home. Presently, however, his thoughts wandered to a younger and fairer subject. The news, given by his mother, of the engagement of Mary Wilmot had deeply shocked him; though manly pride and the hurry of his fresh return had kept the matter in abeyance for a time of quiet and solitude. He had journeyed home with an impression upon his mind, which however dubious, he could not resist, probably because he did not wish to resist it,-that his arrival would find Mary on one of her not unfrequent visits to his mother; and that her hand would be among the first to greet his, and her kind eyes speak a bright welcome on his coming. However small and uncertain the basis of the anticipation to cool consideration, it was an annoying reverse to hear that she not only was far distant, but perhaps beyond his reach forever.</p> 
               <p>He felt as if he had been somehow defrauded, if not of a right, at least of an opportunity that belonged to him. But as he proceeded to try the case in <foreign xml:lang="LAT">foro conscientic,</foreign> he was forced to admit, that he could make out no substantial grievance on any party on whom he<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6274-00000048"/> could urge a claim or enforce a remedy. He was of that equable temperament which is best adapted to secure the happiness of its owner, as well as of his neighbors, in this rough world. His affections, though strong, were not so impetuous and unreasoning as to cloud or mislead judgment; neither was his intellect so exacting and overbearing as to cramp or perplex his affections. He could quietly take things in the concrete, with all their mixed good and evil; without expecting to regulate the shortcomings and annoyances of an imperfect world, by his own presumptions of interest and abstract right, or worrying unprofitably over what was inevitable. His thoughts soon assumed a more peaceful cast. He mused awhile over the scenes of days gone by, when Mary was the favorite and genial companion of his childish sports, till weariness wrapt him in a sound sleep, which was only disturbed by a rap upon his door announcing that the tea-table was ready.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head> 
               <p>THE sun was still far above the western horizon, when Butler, having finished his supper and a short chat with his mother, stood upon the door-step, surveying with interested curiosity the scenes of his boyish experiences. A flood of glowing light still poured over the western sky, gilding with an intense brilliancy the craggy summits of the rough hills that lay in the background; and an amber sheen carpeted the tops of the dark forest that stretched over the long, broken swells of upland, which formed the more immediate boundaries of the little valley. The light vapors that lay about the junction of earth and sky were already burning into one of those magnificent sunsets, whose superb and gorgeous hues clothe the departure of the day, in the clear evenings of our pure summer atmosphere. The burnished glory of the sky was deeply yet softly contrasted by the obscurity, that began to gather about the spots no longer reached by the sun's rays. Deep patches of olive thickened under the borders of the tall and dark woods; and the easterly slopes of hill and dale put on soft tints of duskiness over the vivid green of their daylight hues. Long shadows were projected from the scattered pines and birch thickets which the axe had spared along the shores of the rivers, one side of which flowed cool and dark beneath the shaded bank, while the other reflected the sunlight still, from its sparkling surface. The eastern side of the little<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6274-00000049"/> valley lay basking in the horizontal beams of sunset; while each dark brown log-house or framed cottage showed its glowing front, more clearly defined even than in the diffusive splendor of noon; and behind each and behind every bush and stump and ragged fence, massive shadows crept further and further up the slopes. Thus, the whole river course and basin was variegated by the deepest and most striking contrasts of light and shade; while the highlands that bordered it shone like a gilded frame in the unobstructed rays, and the far-off mountains lay in the distance wrapt in a softened shroud of purple and golden mist.</p> 
               <p>Butler gazed a few moments in silent admiration at the rare beauty of the scene, till his mind became absorbed in a revery, in which past, present, and future were dreamily and vaguely mingled. He thought of the times when he and Mary Wilmot fished for trout, or paddled, a skiff upon the river, or wandered off into the woods, or picked berries about the fields together; then of the charms and seductions of the commercial town, the elegant and well-dressed women, the grave and stately merchants, till city belles, ships and ledgers, woods, waters and mountains, India voyages and counting-rooms, farms, forests, deer, fish, rifles, and fishing-rods, were all jumbled together in his speculations.</p> 
               <p>But he was presently recalled from these engrossing reflections, by occasional shouts of laughter, loud talking, and other tokens of social companionship, coming from a spot not far down the road, which to his ear were familiar and well-understood sounds of a summer evening. Taking then a final look at the picturesque scene, from the dark belt of forest that curtained the crests of the uplands and the purple mountain tops afar off, to the valley bottom where the level rays struggled confusedly in among the deepening shadows of bank, bush, and tree, every salient point gilt with glory, every depression and reverse cradled in a soft and tender gloom, he turned half unwillingly down the road to exchange greetings with his old neighbors.</p> 
               <p>The social wants of our nature require conventional gathering-places, where the life-currents of the community may commingle, and whither each individual may repair from the wearisome monotony of his own daily round, to return again to his special sphere, refreshed and invigorated; as every drop of blood is constantly concentrated in the heart to be relieved in the lungs of its accumulated impurities, and sent forth again, disburdened and rejuvenated, to carry new health and vigor to the extremities of the system. The church, the theatre, and the mercantile exchange answer each their peculiar purposes; but there is an humbler but more general need yet which they do not supply. Outside of the pillared temples of Mammon in great cities, where the Rothschilds and Astors buy and sell the world, kings, emperors, and nationalities included, there will be the "Loafers' Exchange," established upon the shaded sidewalk in summer and in the cosy sunny corner in winter, where the undiscriminated multitude congregate to barter, not only merchandise, but ideas and sympathies. The village inn, or village green in Old England, and the business centres of each of our more bustling and active; rural towns, furnish a like gathering-place; where politics, trade, gossip and amusement supply occasions of relaxation, profit, and advancement to every humor. Here the demagogue goes, to show his political wisdom and to lay, in obscure foundations, his future influence. The money-getter<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6274-00000050"/> comes here to catch a chance for a speculation; the bully and the wit to show off their braggadocio and their jokes; and the idler to gossip and chat and laugh at all that comes up in the multifarious assemblage.</p> 
               <p>The inhabitants of Merrifield were accustomed to congregate, in the pleasant weather, upon either or both ends of the little bridge that joined with its friendly bond the two sides of the river. On these occasions, the railings displayed a row of red-shirted mill and lumber-men, sitting, like a string of fowls upon their roost, smoking their pipes and whittling in careless relaxation after the day's work. The magnates of the hamlet, the two lawyers, the doctor, and the traders, whose shops were chiefly in the immediate vicinity, did not generally compromise their dignity by such a gallinaceous attitude, but stood or walked to and fro, about the front of the line; while a small crowd of boys and stragglers fringed the outskirts of the assemblage with little knots busied with, their own amusements, but every ready to catch up any joke or crowd in to listen to any discussion, that turned up among the more staid portion of the throng.</p> 
               <p>On the night of Butler's arrival the gathering embraced almost every man and boy in the village; for the news of his coming had been speedily diffused, and beside the intrinsic importance of a visitor fresh, from the metropolis, all were eager to greet the bright, free-hearted boy, still well remembered and affectionately regarded by all his old neighbors. It seemed too, that the women, especially the younger ones, had an unusual need of articles from the shops that evenings; so that, on one pretext or another or on none at all, the whole village was astir. Butler's approach was soon observed and announced by the boys who were frolicking about the road, and the information caused an immediate stir in the conclave. The mill-men got down from their perch, stopped their whittling and put their knives into their pockets. Squire Preston pulled up his shirt-collar and set his hat straighter upon his head, and followed by the doctor, the traders, and all who felt their position entitled them to prominence, sauntered towards the corner to meet the object of their general interest. Unconscious of his extraordinary importance and unaffectedly pleased to meet his old acquaintances, James exchanged greetings with the dignitaries; and this more quiet process over, found himself surrounded by a swarm of rough, hardy men, who shook his hands with a rude energy, that but for the limited number of the claimants for notice, might have been somewhat exhausting. It happened too, rather oddly, that quite a number of rosy-faced damsels chanced to be coming out of the shop-doors just at this moment, not to mention several of the staid matrons of the village; and as they were all by accident arrayed in their gayest and choicest attire, the whole formed quite an imposing scene, such as the rustic little hamlet seldom saw. But the more delicate and ornamental features of it were lost upon the unconscious Butler. For, buried in the eager crowd of his male friends, the innocent witcheries of the young girls and the benign smiles of welcome that wreathed the older female faces were lost to him, and the innumerable questions that poured on him, effectually barred all opportunity for softer and sweeter greetings; so that, after lingering around in vain for some minutes, they took reluctant flight, to await a more quiet occasion. Upon the edge of the throng too, stood another unobtruding figure, but of the rougher<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6274-00000051"/> sex. With his quick gray eye suffused with emotion, and his whole frame quivering with suppressed feeling, his look was fixed on Butler, as if he longed, yet dared not to rush up to him and express the pleasure which evidently absorbed his every idea. It was the poor vagabond Shirk, but vagabond no longer; for he was now neatly through simply dressed like his neighbors. The grotesque garb and incongruous air of the dependent upon the odds and ends of charity had given place to the consistent and independent mien of the man, who has his own place and is able to keep it. His features had no longer the unsettled and wandering look or the painful recklessness of his days of destitution; but intelligent, calm, and bright, bespoke a character considerably above the average of the uneducated children of labor, and capacity of large and genial development. So, it was not a sense of shabbiness that prevented Sam from coming forward with others to shake hands with Butler. Nor was it, by any means, that he could plead no claim of acquaintanceship. For, even then, he was busily thinking of the days so long ago, yet seemingly so near, when he rapid the constant kindness of the generous-hearted boy who so often relieved his bitter wants, with such toys as his ingenuity could supply for boyish sports; and when his own desultory and aimless hours were so frequently employed, in Butler's company, in the thousand enterprises and active amusements which boys love. For Sam, notwithstanding his humble position, had always had been admitted to the sports of his young neighbors; indeed his ready wit, activity, and promptitude made him almost indispensable on all important occassions, and his good temper rendered him a general favorite. Butler's natural sagacity, especially, had led him to discern Shirk's good qualities under all his mean exterior, and his manly and generous feelings recognized and appreciated them as readily as if poor Sam's fortunes had been on a par with the best of his comrades. In truth, there were strong sympathies between them. Nobody knew so well as either James or Sam where to find a trout, a partridge, or a deer, or better loved to catch them. Sam had an unbounded admiration for Butler, and James did full justice on all occasions to Sam, unchecked by any worldly disparity between them. In remote parts of the country, there is little deference paid-especially by boys-to arbitrary rules of social etiquette.</p> 
               <p>But Sam Shirk, through ragged and miserably poor, was no vulgar boy. He had inherited from his mother the delicate organization which had made destitution a crushing and fatal burden to her; and while he bravely bore up under his own early apprenticeship to misery, he never lost his instinctive reverence for excellence. If, in the pitiless chaos of his utter helplessness, he had not always walked with unerring steps over the quaking bog, the moment he felt the firm ground beneath his feet, he stood erect and steady again in natural integrity.</p> 
               <p>When he saw Butler stand before him with the easy and self-possessed air of educated refinement,-which he could intuitively appreciate, little as he was familiar with it,-his unexceptionable dress and manner, his manly bearing, and handsome, animated face, his old comrade appeared to him something almost more than human. He remembered too, that Butler was probably the ultimate arbiter in the matter of the defaced deed of the little farm, which was the sole material basis of his pecuniary welfare and his now deeply<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6274-00000052"/> cherished social independence. This reflection brought also with it a mortifying remembrance of his own ridiculous position in relation to the affair, so momentous to him. Altogether he felt it impossible to summon resolution to accost James. An instinctive sense of honorable delicacy withheld him from making a claim, which might seem, and which indeed he really felt to be, presumptuous, of renewing with the man, so far above him in position and outward advantages, the acquaintance of careless boyhood. Under the influence of all these feelings poor Sam hung round the edges of the little crowd, unwilling to go away, yet unwilling to advance,-longing, yet fearing to be recognized. With moist eyes and lips firmly compressed, as if to shut up within himself his contending emotions, he furtively followed every movement and hung upon every word of the absorbing object of his interest,-whom alone he saw and heard.</p> 
               <p>But it was not long before Butler's sharp eye caught his retreating figure. At first he could hardly believe that the decently clad, intelligent-looking young man before him was his old forlorn, well-remembered playmate. But a second glance assured him of the fact, and gave him also a partial comprehension of the feelings that agitated Shirk's working and expressive features, when he caught Butler's fixed gaze. Hastily pushing his way to his side, James extended his hand, which was seized with an eager grasp that conveyed in its nervous pressure all the depth of the still subdued emotion.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Sam; you the last to shake hands with me!"</p> 
               <p>The poor fellow cast a single earnest look into James' face, as if he longed to speak; then biting his quivering lips, dropped his eyes to the ground, without uttering a word. James laid his hand kindly upon his shoulder, and said in a low tone, so as to be heard by him alone,-"I hardly knew you, Sam. I am right glad to see you,-and looking so well too. I have not forgotten the old times, Sam. Come to the house, after breakfast to-morrow. Don't forget, I will stay till you come."</p> 
               <p>Butler then turned away, delicately desirous of not drawing the general attention to his agitated companion, who, murmuring a broken "God bless you," rushed away behind a neighboring pile of lumber, and sinking down with his face between his hands, let loose his pent-up excitement in a flood of proud and happy, tears,-tears with which were mingled thoughts of his poor, pale, emaciated, lost mother, and his young, bright-eyed, recovered friend.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head> 
               <p>THE next morning James broached the subject of Shirk's affairs to his mother at the breakfast-table.</p> 
               <p>"Mother, I saw Sam Shirk last night. He is all right; and you will give him another deed of the little farm, I suppose."</p> 
               <p>"But have you seen Deacon Hardy about it, my son?"</p> 
               <p>"No, mother, and why should I? The land is your own to give, and nobody has any interest in it, beside you, but myself; and I am satisfied. The Deacon's objections are all fudge."</p> 
               <p>"But, James," said the old lady, fidgeting a little in her chair, "I don't like to do it, hardly, without the Deacon's knowing it."</p> 
               <p>"Mother, it's none of the Deacon's business; and I don't mean he shall make it so. To speak plainly, mother, I don't altogether like the Deacon's way of thinking and talking. This grim, square-cornered doctrine of his don't suit me. There's something else in this world than his stiff notions and sour creed; and something a good deal better too. And, the long and short of it is, if you don't give Sam a new deed, I shall give him a piece of my own land instead,-if you won't be angry with me, mother."</p> 
               <p>"I, angry with you, James! No, indeed. If you feel quite sure it an't wrong, I'll sign a new deed for Sam right away."</p> 
               <p>"On the contrary, mother, I am sure it would be very wrong not to do it. The disappointment would probably discourage Sam forever. And, take my word for it, he will make an good use of your kindness. Your own kind heart, dear mother, is a better guide than all the deacons in the world."</p> 
               <p>"O, no, James, don't say so, I'm a sinful creature, like everybody else."</p> 
               <p>"No you an't, mother. There's sin enough in the world, no doubt. But if a man should call <emph>you</emph> sinful, I should just knock him down for his pains."</p> 
               <p>"O, my boy, what are you talking about? Now, that's the real old Adam; what good would it do to knock anybody down for calling me sinful?"</p> 
               <p>"I think it might" do him a great deal of good, mother; and I know it would me. And as for the old Adams and the young Adams too, God made 'em all: and He has done it a great deal better than Deacon Hardy would. But, I'm afraid you'll begin to think <emph>me</emph> wicked, mother."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> think you wicked, James; O, what should I do, if I did think so?"</p> 
               <p>"Sure enough, mother, and I hope never to give you reason to think me very bad; although I have plenty of room to improve, and with God's help mean to do so. But what of the old Adam and Deacon Hardy's doctrines now, mother?"</p> 
               <p>"O dear! James, don't argue. I can't; it puzzles me to death. Don't say any more, but get the deed made and I'll sign it."</p> 
               <p>"Very good, dear mother. You'll find it will all turn out right. And one thing more. A farm is of no use<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6274-00000054"/> without some stock. Now I think it will be well to give Sam old Brindle into the bargain. We have got three or four heifers coming in next spring, and shall never miss her. I want to do something for him too; and that shall be my present. What should I have done if Shirk had not prevented the old mare's breaking your neck?"</p> 
               <p>Soon after this arrangement was concluded, Shirk came in. Although he shook Butler's extended hand with a grateful confidence very different from the nervous timidity of their last interview, yet a shade of anxiety was visible on his countenance, until dispelled by Butler's smiling face and welcome communication that everything was satisfactorily adjusted.</p> 
               <p>"Now Sam," said James, "we shall expect you to be a little more careful in future. You have some leeway to make up, as the old salts in Boston say; and you must do your best for awhile to be up to your improved position. By and by you will not need to thank anybody but yourself for all you want."</p> 
               <p>A bright glow of happy resolve flashed over Shirk's face; but was succeeded in a moment by a look of quiet gratitude, as he replied,-</p> 
               <p>"If ever I am anything, it will be all along of you and your mother. 'Twill be a bitter day to me, if I should live to see you repent 'out. Only, Mr. James, I hope you will help me with your advice for awhile; and not let me make a fool of myself again."</p> 
               <p>"I will help you in every way I can, Sam. Don't hesitate to come to me if you are troubled about anything. And now I want to do a little for you too, for the shake of old times; and I will give you a cow to start with, and then you will get along famously, Sam. You can manage as well as the best of us, when you set about it in earnest, I am sure."</p> 
                
               <p>Shirk's mobile features had already shown strong symptoms of emotion; but now he was completely over powered. He sank into a chair beside him and covering his face with his hands, sobbed like a child.</p> 
               <p>The good dame had been sitting at her knitting, revolving in her mind the problem of her son's earnest disagreement with the views of Deacon Hardy; and still somewhat concerned least some latent heresy might be involved in his indignant repudiation of the Deacon's arrogance in its grab of pretentious humility. She could not distrust her manly, Free-hearted boy; yet she did not dare to differ from the Deacon. Her perplexed meditations were interrupted by Sam's sobs; for, having gladly thrown the weight of active responsibility upon her son, she had been paying no attention whatever to his proceedings, absorbed as she was in her helpless bewilderment. She started at her interruption, dropped her knitting-work into her lap and her spectacles from her nose. Then she took a long, wondering look at Sam, and ejaculating, "O my! did you ever!" burst into tears herself.</p> 
               <p>After this propitious termination of his troubles, Shirk made up his mind irrevocably to better things. He called to his aid the ingenuity his vagabond life had compelled him to cultivate, to compensate, in some measure, for the lack of industry it had induced. By making contrivance, in some degree, a substitute for hard work, he hoped to effect his purposes without utterly intolerable drafts upon his patience. His most important step in this direction was a negotiation with a landless new-comer, a thrifty Scot with an industrious family, whom he took into partnership upon terms advantageous to both. In virtue of this compact, the produce of the farm was to be divided between them,<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6274-00000055"/> while in consideration of Sam's ownership and contribution of active capital, to wit, the pig and cow, Leonard McKim undertook the chief part of the agricultural labor, leaving to Sam mainly the fencing and other mechanical improvements, with the head-work in general. By this judicious arrangement, Shirk succeeded in materially relieving his back, without impairing the comfort of the opposite part of his body. A good, active, tall girl of his copartner's also began to find favor in his eyes; and it was soon settled that the alliance should be cemented, and Sam's stockings and coats mended by the fair hand of Miss Jenny. Under this judicious arrangement, prosperity and comfort soon crowned the united exertions of the family.</p> 
               <p>For some time after his return, Butler was chiefly occupied by the care of the family property and the erection of a new house more comfortable and congenial to his tastes. He also devoted much time to reading, and superintending Sam Shirk's advancement, and renewing his old associations. He had made a visit to Mr. Wilmot's family, among other old friends, where he was received with the usual cordiality. But when the conversation was turned upon Mary, Mrs. Wilmot entertained him to such an extent with the accomplishments of her young theological cousin, with whom the young lady was, according to her letters, so agreeably employed in an extensive course of reading and study, that he was induced to cut short his call, and felt little inclination to repeat it. Although her mother made no special allusion to the nature of their intimacy, and perhaps thought of nothing, herself, but of her maternal satisfaction in the acquirements of her daughter, his preconceived ideas led him irresistibly to conclude, that their intercourse had undoubtedly other charms for both parties than the interest belonging to their mutual studies. He naturally grew convinced that literature and science were not the only nor the most powerful bond of union between them. "Her cousin cannot but love her," thought he, "and he has every chance of winning her affections. There is little doubt how it will turn out, if he is good for anything; and perhaps he deserves her better than I do. At any rate, if she prefers him, what right have I to complain." So pride and despair both seemed to lead him to the conclusion, that the wisest part for him was to resign his hopes in that quarter, or at least to prepare as well as he could for disappointment. The practical efficacy of which philosophical conjunction we can most of us estimate at its true value.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head> 
               <p>FOR a long period, the weather had continued of that bright and equable serenity which almost makes us believe that the causes of elemental strife are at rest forever; and that its quiet beauty and steady temperature will never be interrupted again, it seems so perfectly balanced and unexceptionable.</p> 
               <p>But, one morning, the sun rose bright as ever, only to veil the golden sheaves of the horizontal beams that, for a few moments, flooded the waking earth with glory, behind a long, low, leaden cloud, which seemed to have drawn itself across the gates of the dawning day, purposely to bar its sunshine. At first narrow and apparently insignificant, it grew broader and broader, and unrolled itself into long, gray folds, like a curtain drawn in drooping segments loosely over the sky, till it covered the whole heavens, and shut out at last the ruddy reflections that lingered along the western verge of the horizon. Then curling mists began to gather round the tops of the inland hills, cutting them asunder, in the middle, and shutting out soon the whole upper region of the air with an impenetrable and gloomy veil. A subtile and vague chilliness stole over the fresh, clear atmosphere, and presently low sullen gusts began to creep in from the ocean, piling up the salt vapors before them, though almost imperceptibly at first. The chill breathings from the sea, sobbing louder and heavier over the land, soon swelled into strong and fitful blasts, driving in their van a dense fog, that gradually flattened itself out, between earth and sky, into a gray atmosphere of mist which wrapped every object in its dripping and cheerless embrace, till all light and from were gradually extinguished almost as effectually as by the shades of night.</p> 
               <p>By the time the early-rising population of Merrifield had dispatched their morning meal, the superincumbent vapors began to drop earthward, at first in soft and trickling dews, then in large, straggling drops; till finally falling in unbroken sheets of rain, they turned the lower stratum of the fog at once into a pouring avalanche of water. The southeast wind rushed in from seaward with constantly increasing fury, bringing fresh supplies of moisture from the boundless reservoirs of the deep, which it dashed in torrents over the streaming earth. The gutters and casual hollows swelled to brooks and ponds; and the brooks began to road along their channels, as they disgorged the sudden flood in tumultuous streams into the river, which soon exchanged its clear, bright flow for a turbid and boisterous current, as the muddy contributions of its tributaries overpowered the purer supplies of its perennial fountains. The resources of the villagers for the occupation of a day that prohibited out-door employment were not great. Newspapers were unknown, and the current literature of the time, scanty and limited everywhere, seldom found its way into such remote corners. Reading was not a habit of the period; for, indeed, there was little to excite or sustain any propensity to it. The flood of books, adapted to all tastes and capacities, that now issue daily from the press, was not then dreamed of. A single meagre and dingy sheet, published in the metropolis, was the sole representative<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6274-00000057"/> sentative of the diurnal tide of news that now overspreads the country through countless channels. When out-door avocations were suspended, the males were accustomed to assemble in the shops, as the only available points of general intercourse, to while away the time as they best might.</p> 
               <p>Although Deacon Hardy was far from popular, yet his place of business, as being the largest and best stocked for the supply of general wants, was a favorite spot. Moreover the Deacon's concern in the lumbering business was large; and his premises consequently afforded facilities for employment to the laboring class, with the important and agreeable concomitant of sure wages,-for Hardy, though exacting and penurious, was a regular and good paymaster.</p> 
               <p>Consequently, when it became evident that a steady rain had set in, a miscellaneous assemblage gathered at an early hour and settled down quietly into permanent conclave. Some perched on the counters, some sat on the heads of the flour barrels, bags of coffee, or tobacco boxes, while a fortunate few occupied a pine bench and three or four dilapidated chairs, whose well-whittled and battered outlines gave sure proof of long service. A light fire was kindled in the stove, to dispel the damp; and pipes were lighted, and jack-knives set in operation upon shingles, laths, and strips of pine, to relieve the tedium of the vacant hours.</p> 
               <p>The whittlers soon covered the floor with a litter that might have been supposed distressing to a person of Hardy's exactitude and neatness; and it probably would have been so, but that it was one of the established institutions of society in Merrifield, so universally recognized, that it would not enter into the most censorious brain to quarrel with it. Therefore the shopkeeper keeper took the annoyance, if such he felt it, as he did the mud brought in upon their feet, as inevitable and matter of course.</p> 
               <p>Sam Shirk was among the Deacon's visitors, on this occasion, as he very often was, notwithstanding the continual sparrings that marked their mutual antipathies. For these bouts were the source of mischievous enjoyment more than anything else, to Sam's reckless and boisterous good-humor; while his antagonist, though always getting the worst of the encounter, could never, even in discomfiture, bear to forego so good a text as Sam and his delinquencies afforded for the moral disquisitions which he so much delighted in. They were like a pair of ill-trained oxen, such as we often see hauling away from each other as far as the yoke will let them, till they incline like boats borne down by a heavy side-wind. The awkward aversion, though it wastes the strength and impairs the comfort of both, grows into a habit so inveterate that neither knows how to maintain his equilibrium, without the mutual burden of his cross-grained comrade dragging at his throat.</p> 
               <p>Sam sat there among the rest. But after smoking several pipes and manufacturing up his shingle into dogs' heads, ducks, and fishes, he got up and went to the door, and looked out through its glazed upper half upon the storm. The rain dashed against the little panes of glass by pails-full, with a concussion, as it flew upon the blast, as if a heavy wet cloth had been thrashed against the sashes. The streets were covered with sheets of waters, and the gutters were running in furious clay-colored torrents.</p> 
               <p>"I rather guess, if the rain holds on long like this, it'll be good drivin' on the river to-morrow," observed Sam.</p> 
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6274-00000058"/> 
               <p>"I was thinking of that," replied the Deacon, from behind his counter, "and I think 'twill be a good plan to get in that lot of logs that was hung up on Little Falls this spring. The mills are all pretty much out."</p> 
               <p>"There wont be nothin' to hender, Deacon. It's a master-rain, as ever I see."</p> 
               <p>"If the river rises enough, I should like to have you take charge of my crew, Shirk."</p> 
               <p>"Very well, I can as well's not. I'll be along bright and early in the mornin'; and we'll see how 'tis."</p> 
               <p>It may be thought queer that Shirk should be the first man engaged by Hardy for this expedition, considering the contempt in which the Deacon held his industrial accomplishments in general. But the trader, as usual, knew very well what he was about. Log-driving is a special matter, as it is one of the highest importance. It is to the lumberman what the tournament or the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mele</foreign> in battle was to the chivalry of the Middle Ages,-the test of courage, strength, and skill. Requiring the greatest intrepidity and the severest exertion, it has also in it a degree of risk, that gives it the peculiar zest which danger and difficulty have for adventurous spirits. A good river-driver stands among his fellows as a gallant champion in the lists, or a brave warrior in the battle-field did among, the feudal nobility. Such tame and dull labors as the hoeing of corn and potatoes were distasteful to Sam; but not because he was inert, but simply averse to plodding industry. These every-day matters did not awaken his energies. He had a settled contempt for hoes and shovels, but give him a rifle, a fishing-rod, or a handspike, and he was sure to be first among the foremost. His acknowledged excellence too, in such matters, called forth his personal pride, of which he had plenty, when the right stimulus was applied. Sam bragged that he was "hard to beat" in any athletic and exciting business or amusement,-and he had a right to do so.</p> 
               <p>On this occasion the wishes of the mill-owners were amply fulfilled. The rain continued to pour down all day and through the night; and by morning a heavy freshet was running in the river. Instead of the usual shoal, clear current, fretting and toying over the stones and other inequalities of its bed, the stream poured down its channel in deep and sullen strength; and its glassy and compressed waters rushed through the piers of the rude bridge in mighty swirls, that shook the rough fabric like a reed in the wind. A fleet of chips, slabs, and stray logs, immersed in a perfect porridge of sawdust and mud, covered its whole surface, as the rising flood cleaned out all the nooks and corners of the shores of their rubbish, and ploughed up the torpid drift of stagnant pools and eddies before the rage of the accumulated waters.</p> 
               <p>Gangs of men were already employed about the mills, in securing the logs in their booms, and relieving the pressure upon the reeling dams, by opening the flood-gates to let off the deluge. The rain was still falling fitfully in showers; but the breaks in the clouds, and the still and brightening atmosphere, showed that the storm was over. Little groups were gathered round the shop-doors of all the business men. The log-drivers were bustling about, supplying themselves with provisions and the tools of their craft,-the stout handspikes of tough, hard wood, and the long slender spruce poles, each armed at the lower end<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6274-00000059"/> with sharp steel spikes, and strengthened with iron clasps, like the battle-axes and spears of former times. Their picturesque costume pointed out at once, to the practiced eye, the men bound for "the drive." They stood about, resting on the heavy handspikes, or with shouldered pike-poles, a little army, awaiting the signal for the march. Bright red flannel shirts, the invariable uniform of lumbermen, gave to their dress a picturesque semi-military appearance. Each carried, thrown loosely over his shoulders, or across his arm, a warm, heavy overcoat, to be worm only at night, or in seasons of rest and inactivity; for, when engaged in work, an outer garment would be an unnecessary incumbrance to the free use of their stalwart limbs, that asked on common occasions no such effeminate protection. Stout boots, whose heavy soles were studded with iron cramps to give them a safe hold upon the slimy and slippery surface of the logs, completed their equipment, except that every man wore strapped upon his back a small stock of provisions, and a blanket or old quit for the nightly bivouac upon the ground.</p> 
               <p>Sam headed Deacon Hardy's crew, and impatiently hurried up one or two loiterers, with an occasional emphatic phrase, that would have drawn upon his a severe rebuke on ordinary occasions. But the Deacon was in a hurry too, to equip and start his men, and charitably withheld his censures; forgiving the exuberance of Shirk's zeal in consideration of his motive, and perhaps somewhat mollified by the reflection, that if the foreman of his gang swore a little, it was done for his own interest and at somebody else's expense. The stimulated activity of the men was his gain, while the responsibility of the means rested on Sam. Besides, the advantage was palpable and direct, and the harm somewhat theoretic and remote.</p> 
                
               <p>Just as they were moving off, Butler came up suitably attired, with a light handspike on his shoulder, and joined them.</p> 
               <p>"What, Mr. James, you an't goin' onto the river, be you?" asked a Shirk.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I am, though, Sam; we have some logs in the drive; and although I can't do much among you water-rats, I mean to go up, if it's only to see the fun. It will be a rarity to me you know."</p> 
               <p>"Well, we are ready, and shall be glad of your company, all of us, I'll guarantee."</p> 
               <p>So saying Sam strode off, Butler taking a place by his side, while some "drivers," whom he had brought with him, fell into the rear with Sam's squad. They walked rapidly on over the rough street that ran up the eastern shore of the river; then, leaving its valley, climbed a steep hill which led them to the table-lands above, in order to avoid a deep bend of the stream which here trended to the westward far out of their course. After crossing a belt of woods and skirting for a mile or two an extensive tract of moorland, they reached the point of action.</p> 
               <p>They then stood upon the bank of the river again, where it made a slight curve in its course through the barren plains, which swept away for miles on every side, except to the south, where they were fringed by the forest through which the log-drivers had just crossed. But, for a vast distance east, west, and north lay a monotonous sweep of table-land, sometimes an almost perfect level for miles, but broken, here and there, by sudden ravines through which little tributary streams found their way to the river. Its light and sterile soil was insufficient to sustain a growth of forest-trees, but copses of birch bushes, with an occasional<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6274-00000060"/> clump of hackmatacks, were scattered over its reaches, clothed on their immediate surface with a tangle of huckleberry bushes, hardhacks, and other low shrubs, with patches of feathery ferns and hassocks of luxuriant but coarse bent grass. Here and there a gray boulder, covered with lichen and weather-stained, rose angular, stark, and conspicuous; while, far away on every border, the girdling, woods stretched over the distant valleys and over the rolling hills. To the southwest, Tunk Mountain, craggy and bleak, surrounded by its group of subordinate peaks, broke the sky line with a huge chaos of precipices and towering rocks, scowling down upon the dark mantle of forest that shadowed their huge flanks. The blue twin tops of Humpback, and the long ridge of Pleasant Mountain, loomed on the horizon to the north and east, and dim, hazy summits far away in the interior filled up every vista of the vast field of forest. The stream, as, in times long gone by, it worked out its channel through the flat plains, had here encountered a ledge of slaty rock; over whose shelving surface it made its way in a hurried and impetuous course, though nowhere broken by perpendicular falls, forming, for the space of a hundred rods, or more, what in the phrase of the country are called rips or ripples. Along the slope of this rocky bed boulders of various size were scattered irregularly, sometimes single, but oftener in clusters, either the disintegrated remnants of the original surface of the ledge, or washed out from the soil above and stopped in their downward path by the inequalities of the rocky platform. The freshest of the spring had lodged against these obstacles some logs, which in their turn aided to arrest the progress of the rest, until a complete dam had been formed across the entire channel. The pressure of the flood, thus checked and thrown back, served only to pin the imprisoned timber more securely to its rough anchorage; while log upon log, brought down upon the constantly rising tide of the accumulated waters, was furiously launched upon the top and rear of the growing barrier. An immense mass of the drifting timber had thus been piled up by the deluge, until the river-bed was filled for half a mile or more with innumerable logs, interlaced and tangled together at every possible angle of inclination, left by the falling flood at a height varying from ten to twenty feet, like a heap of gigantic jack-straws scattered by the hand of a Titan. Some lengthwise, some athwart, pushed up almost perpendicularly into the air, or horizontal, the huge sticks formed a solid rampart of wild perplexity, that seemed to defy every effort at disentanglement and extrication.</p> 
               <p>A hardy crew were already scrambling in all directions over this bristling chevaux-de-frise, balancing their heavy handspikes like rope-dancers, as they sprang from point to point, and examined carefully the position and arrangement of the timber, if such terms may be applied to such a mass of interminable confusion. They moved as easily over the snarled surface as revelers upon the floor of a ball-room; while the river, now again swollen to a flood, chafed and struggled in foaming eddies to force its clogged passage through the barricade. The undertaking of "breaking the jam" would have seemed hopeless enough to uninitiated eyes, but was a familiar matter with them; and unusual difficulty and danger, such as were promised in the present case, stimulated rather than daunted their trained daring. The leaders of the crews contributed by the various log-owners, collecting together<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6274-00000061"/> upon the front, carefully explored the bearings of the prominent logs upon the rocks and upon each other, to ascertain where they might best hope to make a breach, and give vent for the passage of the superincumbent mass behind. To find the Gordian knot that tied the whole together was the first thing to be done.</p> 
               <p>After considerable deliberation, the red-shirted Garibaldis of the woods settled upon the probable key of the position and made their arrangements. Butler, with a crew of lighter hands, superintended the clearing away of the flanks and front, of everything that might check progress anew; while a crew of experienced veterans commenced working out a tunnel through the bristling forehead of the jam. Lightening for a space the superincumbent pressure, by prying and rolling off into the stream below such of the upper logs as could be moved, they cautiously dug their way down, till the lower strata of timber began to show themselves among the frothing swirls of the fierce currents, that, having fought their devious way thus far, boiled out in furious freedom at the lower verge. It now became necessary to proceed with the extremest prudence, as the liberation of a single stick might free the whole tremendous mass to rush down unrestrained, before the incalculably powerful pressure of the flood, which, dammed up upon its rear, was tossing with dreadful force through all its throbbing and heaving interstices. Sam Shirk and the other foremen therefore called off their crews to lunch and rest awhile from their severe labors. While the mass of the men lounged and refreshed themselves upon the shores, the more experienced leaders, with a cracker in their hand or pipe in mouth, once more carefully surveyed the indications by which further movements should be determined.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head> 
               <p>AT the expiration of a quarter of an hour, the river drivers assembled again around their leaders. Shirk and Butler had employed the interval in a walk up the stream; and Sam made his report, as follows:-</p> 
               <p>"The water's gettin' down from up above and risin' fast; and the logs begin to squirm and kick lively at t'other end. The jam an't so deep there, but they're pilin' down fast from up stream. Jest hear 'em!" As he spoke, the heavy thud of the drifting logs, as they dashed upon the upper end of the jam, was plainly audible at short intervals. "We must do quick' what is done. The water, I expect, will be a-gainin' all day. But 'twan't a long rain, tho' 'twas a terrible smart one; and the freshet'll run away tonight pretty much, 'cordin' to my idees. If was can't start 'em this arternoon, it'll be all day with us."</p> 
               <p>Shirk's conclusions met with a general concurrence; and it was decided that no time must be lost to break through the front of the jam, if possible.</p> 
               <p>"'Twon't do no harm to be a little careful nuther," observed a muscular, wiry, gray-haired man who stood by, leaning on his heavy handspike. "There's a tremenduous head o' water gittin' up, as Shirk says; these rocks an't very large, and altho' they hold the logs hard enough now, when they <emph>do</emph> start they'll start, I tell ye' boys. You'd better be ready to stan' round smart when they go."</p> 
               <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6274-00000062"/> 
               <p>This caution also met the general approval; and measures were taken accordingly. A large crew was set to work again to lighten the front and top of the jam of every log that could be moved; while half a dozen chosen and resolute men resumed the hazardous operation of picking out the tangled mass at the point where a lane had already been partially opened up into the ragged wall; a channel of considerable width between two of the largest rocks, and nearly in the center of the stream, affording here the best chance of working out a free passage. Though the rain had ceased some hours since, the tributaries of the river among the hills above were still disgorging into it their swollen contributions; and the freshet was about at its greatest height.</p> 
               <p>The surface of the jam trembled and quivered all over, like the frame of a man in strong convulsions, with the struggles of the imprisoned waters. A subdued, grating roar pervaded the air, from the restless chafing and tossing of countless logs moaning and grinding in the fierce grip of the flood, to whose tremendous pressure they could not yet yield. The waters, that, after raging tumultuously along the labyrinthine mass of timber, found their way through at last, poured out at every opening in front in jets of furious foam, or compressed into black and glassy torrents, with a wild impetuosity and force.</p> 
               <p>Amid this bewildering and fearful uproar, the resolute crew still worked coolly on, though their only footing was on slippery logs over which the spray washed continually, while the beetling ends of the timber above their heads trembled constantly, and threatened momentarily to sweep down upon them in a terrible avalanche. By prying, pushing, and lifting, they disentangled many of the projecting sticks; but the grim rampart still kept its place, though apparently ready to totter down, at any moment, upon their heads. The old Nestor of the gang paused, and, sticking the point of his handspike into the log in front of him, anxiously looked about him as he wiped his sweating forehead.</p> 
               <p>"This won't do, boys," said he. "Our handspikes won't reach far eno'; and yet it's as much as our lives is wuth to work here any longer. We must try to haul out some o' those chaps in there with the rope. Here, Bob, throw us the end o' the hawser."</p> 
               <p>The man thus addressed made up in his hand a few coils of a stout rope that lay, upon the bank near him, and tossed it to the speaker within the chasm. It was speedily made fast round a prominent stick, which was soon dragged out with main force, by the united efforts of the crew upon the bank. The operation was repeated with several more, and still the mass was unmoved. But, the bottom of the stream being nearly reached for a considerable space, it had become easier to fix accurately upon the precise points of resistance.</p> 
               <p>Deacon Hardy and some others of the log-owners had just arrived from the village to inquire into their progress; and another council was called for consultation.</p> 
               <p>"Now, Deacon, look here," said Sam Shirk, appealing to his employer. "We might work on this way from July to Etarnity, and not get ahead a switch, no more's ef we sot out to lug the logs on our shoulders over old Tunk Mountain out there. Now Sam Laighton here, and perhaps more on 'em, knows better than I' but I think I see what wants to be done. You see that 'ere stick, Deacon, that lays right across the<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6274-00000063"/> middle channel, with each eend pinched hard agin them two rocks; we can't clear it, for the whole current's, runnin' agin it like destruction; and there's six or seven more logs lodged on it, and a'most as many hundred on the furder eends o' them. Now, I say, that log's got to be cut in two."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Laighton, what do <emph>you</emph> say?" inquired the Deacon, after hearing Sam's opinion.</p> 
               <p>"I think Jest the same," replied the veteran.</p> 
               <p>"Well, then, we must have it cut," added Hardy.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Deacon," continued Shirk, "it's got to be cut, if we want to start this jam, leastwise on this freshet. Afore we can git it out any other way, this run o' water'll be all down. But 'tan't none o' yer easy jobs. The water breaks clean over it, and a feller'd need to take himself out o' the way spry when he hits it the last clip."</p> 
               <p>"That's true, Sam. Well, I'll give a silver dollar to the man that'll chop it in two."</p> 
               <p>The Deacon's offer elicited no immediate reply. The men all knew the peril of the undertaking, and stood a moment, eying in silence the dangerous necessity. Laighton stuck his handspike up in the ground and went back to the spot, carefully reconnoitring the position of the logs, the rest awaiting his conclusion. After a minute or two, he rejoined them.</p> 
               <p>"There an't nothing else to be done, and I s'pose if any man can do it, I can. But 'tan't your silver dollar, Deacon. 'Tan't wuth two cents time to cut that 'ere stick in two on dry land, and 'tan't so much odds mutter that it's under water. A feller'll git his face washed enough, a-choppin', to last him a month, to be sure. But, when a man's got to resk his life, a dollar an't o' no account, nor, for the matter o' that, a thousand. But I've driv on this river ever sence the fust log floated down it, and I an't never seed the thing yet that wanted to be done, that I daresn't do. That log's got to be cut, and I'll cut it."</p> 
               <p>So saying, the stout fellow signed to a comrade to bring him an axe that lay hard by. He passed his finger over the edge, and, poising it in his strong arms, struck it through a birch sapling at his side.</p> 
               <p>"I don't justly like the hang o' that axe. Let's see that other one." After examining the edge of this also and dashing down with it another small birch out of the clump, he threw it over his shoulder and marched steadily down upon the logs. There, selecting carefully his position, he coolly but rapidly chopped it halfway through upon his upper side, while the water dashed all over him under the heavy blows of the axe, and the broad chips flew up into the air and floated away on the boiling eddies below. Then, turning his face down stream, he proceeded to cut through the forward portion. As blow after blow fell splashing through the foam, and slice upon slice widened the gap in the remaining wood, the silent spectators on the banks held their breaths in anxious expectation, and clutched their handspikes convulsively in their strong hands, that trembled with repressed excitement. Presently a sharp crack told that the nearly severed log had yielded to the vast pressure upon it; and its disunited parts bulged slowly outwards. Laighton threw his axe upon his shoulder, and, springing from log to log and rock to rock, cleared the mouth of the gap in which he had been working and sped to the shore. Hard upon his heels, half a dozen, sticks shot like arrows through the aperture he had made, borne upon an impetuous gush of water that filled the channel<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6274-00000064"/> with its dark, concentrated current, flecked with foam. The low, grinding murmur of the writhing timber behind deepened into a roar, that filled the air with that rush and swell of sound that accompanies all resistless impetus; the whole surface of the jam trembled and vibrated with a mighty convulsion; and, as the logs, tossing and pitching, settled themselves to their equilibrium, when the victorious waters sucked them down once more into their bosom, the centre gradually dropped and fell to a level; and once more, water-borne and free, they darted forth in one concentrated and tremendous rush down the narrow sluice-way. Farther and farther up the stream swelled the tumultuous uproar. Like a herd of wild horses, tossing their heads as they break into their mad stampede of flight and terror, the whole host of ramping monsters burst in fury down the channel; while, above the crash and thunder of the logs and the wild roar of the waters, rose a loud and glad hurra, the old Anglo-Saxon battle-cheer of struggle and of victory. Again and again it rang out above the rush of the liberated floods, as it poured down, under, over, and among the sweltering and pitching timber. But the third shout was broken by an anxious exclamation of "Where's Laighton?" and his name, loudly and hurriedly repeated, replaced the exultant peal of triumph with the trembling voice of apprehension. But no answer came to the call of terrible doubt. In the dead silence that fell on the inmost souls as well as upon the tongues of all, nothing was to be heard but the booming and grinding of logs and the wild gurgle of the river. The men looked into each other's faces, for an instant, in blank dismay; then all hurried to various commanding points upon the banks.</p> 
                
               <p>The missing man had last been seen clear of the chasm in the jam, and making his way rapidly to the shore, where a little clump of bushes concealed, for a time, his further progress from his comrades. But his well-known skill and activity, together with the fact that he had passed the point where danger was chiefly to be looked for, in safety, had removed all anxiety on his account. In the excitement of the moment, all eyes had been diverted from him to the spectacle that challenged everybody's attention. His absence was the less likely to be observed, as none who knew his quiet and unpretending courage, expected to see him press himself conspicuously upon the admiring attention of the spectators of his daring exploit.</p> 
               <p>The crowd were now rushing about with that vague and purposeless activity that blindly strives to meet an unexpected calamity; and conjectures and suggestions, hopes and fears, passed from mouth to mouth. But a few did not pause to tattle. Shirk seized a long pike-pole, and, balancing it in his hands, sprang unhesitatingly upon a log, as it rushed by him to join the huge, tossing, crowding fleet into which the timber was drawing itself out below them. His example was followed by half a dozen of the boldest and most active. As the unstable support to, which he intrusted his footing shot down the boiling tide, he shouted back to them, "He was too far in shore to be carried into the main current: he'll be swept into the eddy in the bend yonder."</p> 
               <p>It was a perilous and difficult navigation upon the slippery, slimy log, pitching, rolling, and swashing, as it rushed down the foaming current, now jostling upon its neighbors, now roughly struck first on one side, then to another, in the scrambling, pell-mell race. But Sam and his companions were as much at home upon the<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6274-00000065"/> treacherous and restless surface they were traversing, as other men upon the paved sidewalks of cities, and piloted their rude barks skillfully through all obstacles, adding to their already frantic speed by pushing along to their utmost strength, with their long pike-poles. As they flew through the foam, they scrutinized narrowly the raging river-bed for signs of the lost one. Sam's activity and wiry muscle more than kept the start he had had in the outset. Forcing along the stick on which he rode with might and main, when it became tangled in the crowded mass, he sprang from it to another and another, light as a deer, and, alternately sailing and running over his tossing and rocking pathway, soon reached the little cove where the eddy concentrated, and detained a compact mass of timber floating quietly beyond the influence of the current.</p> 
               <p>"Now look sharp, if you have any eyes," said he to his comrades who had followed hard after him; "scatter yourselves, and look a hungry wolf does for a deer. Ten minutes to a stunded man, under these logs, is life and death."</p> 
               <p>But exhortation was little needed. Hither and thither, in every direction, the raft was swiftly traversed; and a dozen more, who shrinking from the dangerous but more direct path, had run down by the shore, now poured in over every quarter of the embayed timber; and eager eyes peered down into the water in every part. But so far in vain. Nothing was to be seen but the wet logs, glistening in the bright, cheerful sunshine above, quiet and peaceful as if no terrible mystery of death and sorrow could lie hidden under their surface, and the still, turbid depths of the glassy waters covering all below with a veil dark and impenetrable almost as eternity. External Nature moved as ever, calmly on-undisturbed alike in the broad smile of her genial beauty and the unresponsive gloom of her deep secrets-over the scene of the brief struggles of human agony. Worried and disappointed, Shirk stopped for a moment, to throw an eager and anxious glance around him. His quick and excited perception was instantly arrested by a little half-submerged thicket of alder-bushes growing upon an advanced point, now cut off from the adjacent banks by the spread of the swollen waters inundating the natural shore, and standing, like a little island, far out into the flood.</p> 
               <p>"Look into that 'ere clump of alders, Bill Small," he hallooed to a man who was near the spot; "'twould be likely to pick up anythin' that drifted down on the fust rush."</p> 
               <p>The man obeyed the suggestion, and an eager exclamation brought Sam bounding to his side, just as, raising a dripping cap into the air, he proclaimed by a shout his discovery of this trace of the object of their search. "Clear away the logs, quicker'n lightnin'," shouted Sam to the crowd that gathered speedily about them. "Clear away the logs, and look over every foot o' ground. But mind and don't rite up the water." A clear space was soon made by the stalwart arms strung to their utmost energy by hope and fear; and a dark object, prostrate beneath the muddy water, illuminated to a dull, greenish yellow by the bright sunshine thus let in upon it, revealed to the almost despairing searchers the helpless form of their comrade. Three or four I lumbermen, springing into the stream up to their waists, raised the passive body from its dreary bed, and, bearing it gently to the nearest shore, laid it apparently lifeless upon the bank. Hither hurried Hardy, Butler, and others, who had followed their movements with watchful solicitude.</p> 
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6274-00000066"/> 
               <p>Sam Shirk let the broad shoulders and drooping head softly down upon the sloping green turf, and, after one mournful gaze upon the pale face, turned beseechingly to Butler. "Now, James, you and the Deacon are better doctors than I be. Save his life somehow, for God's sake! If those confounded logs han't bruised him to death, he can be brought to, for he han't been in the water above ten minutes. Do somethin' to fetch him to; he's got a wife and children, and he's as good a feller and as good a driver as is on 'Guagus River."</p> 
               <p>He then threw himself on the ground, overcome by the intense exertions he had been making and the deep grief of his kindly heart. Tears rolled down over many rough, bronzed cheeks, as the anxious circle watched the result of the attempts to restore animation to that limp and motionless frame, so lately among the most powerful and energetic of them all. The wet garments were replaced by contributions from the bystanders; and a soft warm bed was made with thick jackets. Examination showed no fractures of the limbs or very serious bruises; but all signs of vitality were suspended by that terrible submersion. To their great joy, chafing by strong and tender hands, with other expedients commonly used in such cases, brought to the wan lips, at last, a faint flutter of breath. A slight flush replaced the deathlike pallor of the features, and finally a little brandy poured down his throat set the subtile machinery of life feebly into play once more. Intelligent light shone, through faintly, from eyes no longer fixed in the dull stare of death, but unequal yet to the task of recognition. As the bodily powers lazily recommenced their functions, his mind took up again the thread of consciousness, so rudely interrupted and so nearly severed.</p> 
                
               <p>"My axe,-I've dropt my axe," he weakly moaned. But the lids dropped; and struggling nature kindly drew the veil back again over his faculties, unable yet to master the crisis completely.</p> 
               <p>"Give him a little more brandy, James, and then we'll let him lie quietly here in the sun. He'll be on his legs again presently. God be praised!" said Hardy.</p> 
               <p>The lumbermen now returned with lightened hearts to their work, leaving the patient in charge of Butler and the Deacon. Headed by Shirk, they proceeded to roll and shove off the logs which struck too closely to the shore to be carried off by the current, and sent them, one by one, to follow their mates down the stream.</p> 
               <p>A messenger had been sent to the village to procure a light sled drawn by a yoke of oxen, for no wheel-carriage could reach the spot. In about two hours this simple vehicle made its appearance, with a strawberries, and a featherbed above, spread over its bars,-making a very comfortable means of conveyance.</p> 
               <p>Laighton had by this time quite recovered his consciousness, and was able to walk, through somewhat sore and feeble from the shock his system had undergone. Placing him carefully upon the sledge, they started for home, Butler taking charge of the docile team, while Hardy walked by the patient's side.</p> 
               <p>The bland west wind blew freshly; and the clear sunshine drew fragrance out of the young leaves, and the green grass. Every breath of the pure air, Nature's great medicine, aided in the restoration of a healthy tone to the mind and body of poor Laighton, who was soon able to converse freely with his friends.</p> 
               <p>"Well, Deacon," said he cheerfully, "I 'arnt your<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6274-00000067"/> silver dollar a little harder than I calculated, though I know'd 'twas a ticklish job. But Providence has spared me awhile, in its marcy. I don't know what would a' become o' Polly and the children."</p> 
               <p>"Don't trouble yourself about that, Laighton," replied James. "We'll take care of all that. You just get well again as fast as you can, and don't worry. All shall be made right for you, and without your getting much in our debt either."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," added Hardy, whose heart, through dulled by selfishness and formality, was right at bottom, and responded cheerfully when hard knocks like this were made upon its guarded door,-"yes, don't fret about anything, one dollar or twenty. 'Twill be all the same. But, if it don't tire you to talk, do tell us how all this happened."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you kindly, Deacon. I don't mistrust you'll do the Christian thing by me; and I hope in a few days I'll be as smart as ever again. But as to this 'ere, I hardly know much about it myself. It's all a mismaze, like a consarned ugly dream."</p> 
               <p>"No wonder," interposed Butler. "A man don't often come out of such a chance to tell of it."</p> 
               <p>"You may say that; I thought I was gone for it. Well, you see, I'd got pretty much clear o' the jam, and consaited I was as good as safe ashore. But I step onto a log that was jest startin' down stream; and afore I could run the length on't, another one came down on't and hit it in the middle, and knocked it clear out o' water. Seemed as if 'twould a driv it into the middle o' next week. I an't slow on logs, but it took everything straight out from under me; and was sech a thunderin' slap, it a kind o' stunded me. I jumped for the next log; but that had got a movin' too, and I fell into the stream. Afore I could pick myself up, a whole heap of 'em rushed right down over me. I tried to get my head up, but the logs was all over me, and I couldn't do it. They kep me under and carried me down with 'em. For a minit, I see first a streak O' light and then a streak of dark-then everything was all mixed up, and then I didn't know no more till I woke up on the bank there."</p> 
               <p>"Thank Heaven, it's no worse," said Butler.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, thank Heaven and the rest on ye."</p> 
               <p>"Amen!" said Hardy.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head> 
               <p>IT had been one of those tropical days which the northern midsummer sometimes through rarely brings, and all the more oppressive from its rarity, when the sun's rays seem in some mysterious manner to double their intensity all at once, and become wellnigh unendurable,-such as rustics significantly call "a yaller day." The very leaves on the trees, and especially the more delicate plants of the garden, drooped and wilted under the fierce heat. It boiled the pitch out of the pine boards, and the yellow clay soil flashed it back into the face of travellers, so as almost to scorch and blind them at once. Animals of all sorts came to a unanimous conclusion to drop the day out of the calendar, and cut its acquaintance, as far as possible. The dogs crept into holes and cellars, or lay painting in cool corners, their tongues lolling out of their mouths dripping with perspiration. The cows plunged into the thick swamps, or rushed into the water, and there stood in patient endurance. Even the poultry, notwithstanding its East Indian descent and its non-conducting mail of plumage, retreated into the inmost recesses of hen-coops and barns, and, if any eggs were laid that day, it was done in the quietest manner possible; for not a cackle broke the torrid hush of the noontide, nor indeed, did any other living sound. Physical energy was too valuable, just then, to be wasted in noise. All human beings suspended their daily tasks, in sheer exhaustion, and strewed themselves about indiscriminately in the coolest or rather the least hot places, in the vain attempt to get some relief out of the bafflings, weakling western breeze, which was just enough to tantalize with a vain hope of comfort. The very air seemed parched and dead, converted into a spiritless and effete ghost of air.</p> 
               <p>The river alone kept along as usual, and rippled and sang in perfect content, shimmering back in scorn the rays, which revenged themselves, nevertheless, by boiling up all the little tomcods imprisoned in the shallow pools.</p> 
               <p>Sunset and the dewy damp of evening came, at last, to the relief of the panting world; and the village poured itself spontaneously out of doors, rejoiced to escape the monotonous discomfort of the tedious day. The night was still warm enough to impart an unusual languor to the scene. The boys, instead of keeping up, as commonly, an incessant skirmishing and uproar about the rough street, followed the more quiet example of their elders, and ranged themselves upon the piles of lumber, where, in default of more active occupation, they whistled, shouted, and laughed. The more public-spirited dogs waited upon their masters to the usual place of the evening gathering; but, instead of chasing the neighboring cats, or rushing in among the boys, on occasion of some especially animated escaped, or getting up little debates among themselves, laid about panting and looking philosophically abstracted from all earthly considerations. The women and girls were gossiping, in quiet clusters, round the doors of the houses; and the men, through assembled, according to custom, at the corners of the<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6274-00000069"/> bridge, discussed such matters as came up with less than their ordinary animation, and with none of the episodes of practical joke and rough outbreaks that often diversified the village councils.</p> 
               <p>The long summer twilight had nearly drawn to its close, and many had risen to seek their homes for the night, when an adventurous puppy, whose juvenile restlessness had broken through the general indolence and led him off on some private errand, set up a vociferous barking a little distance down the road. The alarm was repeated from the throats of a dozen recumbent sympathizers, scattered round about their masters; and the attention of the crowd, both biped and quadruped, thus concentrated upon the spot, soon discovered the object of the outcry in a wagon slowly approaching behind a horse seemingly exhausted by toil and heat. Not even the near neighborhood of food and rest, of which his instinct must have apprised him, seemed to inspire with freshness the weary pace at which the over-done animal dragged one foot after the other. Even this slow progress, however, soon brought the vehicle sufficiently near to enable the curious crowd to distinguish the persons of its occupants.</p> 
               <p>The driver was apparently a slender and somewhat tall young man of the age, perhaps, of twenty-two or three years, with well-formed features and a mild and pleasant expression. The only defect of his face was, that it wore that vague, unpractical air of simplicity which so often marks familiarity with books rather than with men. This indication was confirmed by the black dress and white cravat, which almost conclusively proclaimed him a clergyman. He was unknown to the villagers; and his appearance elicited little comment. But Rob Campbell jogged the elbow of one of his comrades and said in a low tone, "A decent-looking chap, Tom, for a minister; but I don't believe he knows a rifle from a bean-pole, and anybody can see he don't know how to put a horse over the road. That's Mary Wilmot with him, sure. It must be the young minister they say she's going to marry. I don't think she need have gone to the Kennebec to get a smarter husband than that."</p> 
               <p>"I'm afraid you're jealous, Rob!"</p> 
               <p>"Not a bit of it. Mary's a nice girl, and as handsome as ever, and the man that gets her shouldn't complain of his luck. But I have no complaint to make, take whom she may."</p> 
               <p>James Butler, after spending the hot day at home with his books and papers, had sauntered out some time before, to enjoy the freshness of the evening with his neighbors, and had been learning against a pile of shingles, while he joined in the chit-chat. All around him left their places, and advanced into the road, to see who the travellers might be. But James, less stimulated by rustic curiosity, retained his position with metropolitan indifference to an event that so much interested the quiet little community in general. He overheard the conversation of the two youngsters, who happened to stand near him; and the mention of Mary Wilmot's name one gave him a new motive for remaining in the background. His thoughts and feelings were plunged at once into a whirl of confusion by her unexpected coming. Uncertain and anxious as he felt as to the position they were to sustain to each other in the future, he shrank with instinctive reluctance from subjecting to the public gaze his first meeting with her, from which so much was to be hoped and feared. He therefore withdrew himself behind<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6274-00000070"/> his opportune shelter, so that he stood in no danger of being recognized in the faint twilight, and scanned with eager curiosity, from his safe hiding-place, both of the travellers. As the light wagon, the only vehicle that could be used with comfort or safety upon the rough and dangerous roads of that wild region, made its way slowly through the crowd that had gathered round the path, the graceful and well-developed form and bright and amiable face of the young lady were exposed plainly to his interested scrutiny, while she exchanged her greetings with the friends and acquaintances that pressed around to welcome her. The maiden's appearance justified even the fond picture that Butler had so long carried treasured up in his memory. The pretty and warm-hearted girl had indeed grown into a beautiful and lovely woman. In the turmoil of excitement occasioned by the sudden appearance of the living beauty that had been for years the absorbing fancy of his heart, James could do nothing but stare, as if in a dream. Had he been less bewildered by the surprise, he might have noticed that Mary's eyes wandered abstractedly, as if in the search of something expected but not found, while she replied to the salutations that met her on all sides. But he did not; and it was not until the wearied horse broke into a trot, over the smooth planking of the bridge, that rapidly removed the carriage from his front, that he even thought to look at the person whom he supposed to be his rival. One sharp glance at that important personage in the drama, as he was compelled, however reluctantly, to consider him, brought him very much to the conclusion expressed by Robert Campbell. For while the air of educated intelligence and the gentlemanly exterior left but slender der excuse to quarrel with the young lady's taste, he could not, himself, regard him as the sort of competitor in whose success he could very contentedly acquiesce. It was not easy for him to draw any satisfaction from the examination, consider it which way he would.</p> 
               <p>A portions of the loiterers followed the travellers across to the door of the little tavern on the other side of the bridge; some, desirous of more leisurely communication with their young townswoman, and others, simply seeking to make the most of this variation of the usual uneventfulness of Merrifield life. The rest turned toward their homes, to carry the news to their wives and children. Butler was left alone, with the exception of Sam Shirk, who, in his enthusiastic affection for his young patron, followed him like his shadow wherever decorum permitted him.</p> 
               <p>"An't you going over to welcome Mary Wilmot home, Mr. James? You and she used to be as thick together as mischief, in old times."</p> 
               <p>"Yes,-no,-Sam; not to-night, I think. It's late, and she must be very tired after such a day's ride. But why do you call me Mr. James, Sam? We are not ceremonious with each other, here in the woods. Why not say James, as in the old times you spoke of?"</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, I should like to. It seems pleasant to call folks we like best by their own names. But it somehow don't seem as if I had a right. When we was both boys, it was different. You are the best man in 'Guagus now, and I an't nobody."</p> 
               <p>"O yes, you are somebody, Sam, and I wish you to think so, and that other people should too. Now, if you speak to the best man in 'Guagus as if you were<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6274-00000071"/> afraid of him," added Butler, laughing, "I am afraid the worst ones may take it into their foolish heads to think you <emph>are nobody.</emph> And that's just the reason I would wish you to speak to me as freely as others do."</p> 
               <p>"O, thank you, thank you," replied Sam in a voice tremulous with emotion. "That's just like you. And sure enough, if you let me call you James, they needn't, none of 'em, undertake to be uppish with me, and I shouldn't mind if they did; and I'd give anything to know you'd like to have me."</p> 
               <p>"I should like to have you do so, Sam, for my own part, and for the reason I have given you. So do it, in future, if you please. There is but one thing you need be troubled about, Sam, and that is no fault of yours; but it will be your fault, if you don't try to remedy it. You have not had much chance to learn; and to put yourself right, you should, learn to read, write, and cipher well, at least. Don't you think so?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, indeed,-I've often thought on't; and I've tried it some. But I've had a poor chance, as you say."</p> 
               <p>"Well, come to me, Sam, and I'll try to put you in the way. You wouldn't like to go to school with the boys; but I think I should make a tolerable master, and I've plenty of time to teach you in. Come on rainy days, and on any afternoons that you can spare. I spend those times in my own room, in studying, myself."</p> 
               <p>"You study!" cried Sam, in amaze; "why, I thought you'd larnt everything!"</p> 
               <p>"O no, Sam,-not yet. There are several little matters I intend to look up, as I find time. Why, Sam, if you were to study a hundred years, you would probably find more things you desired to learn, at the end of it, than when you began."</p> 
                
               <p>"Then," replied Sam, laughing, "I hardly see the use of beginning."</p> 
               <p>"O yes, don't be frightened: less, a good deal, will do for you and me. You can stop before you get to your hundredth year, if you choose. But we'll try to manage that reading and writing, at any rate,-and now, good-night."</p> 
               <p>"Good-night, sir."</p> 
               <p>Sam then went back to his own log-house, which, humble as it was, was of far more real value to him than many a magnificent mansion and broad domain is to its owner; and Butler returned slowly and thoughtfully home. He paused a moment at the gate; and observing, as he looked around, that most of the village lights were extinguished, and the remaining ones were rapidly disappearing, he felt that relief which we have all experienced when events take out of our hands the necessity of deciding a troublesome question. As he went towards the door, he said to himself, "One point has settled itself, at any rate. It's entirely too late to see her to-night, according to Merrifield ideas."</p> 
               <p>His mother was sitting up for him, knitting-work in hand, but frequent yawns and the intermittent clicking of the needles plainly told that she was getting drowsy. James kissed her as usual, and took up his candle to go up-stairs, but, before he bid good-night, said with a tone of imperial indifference, "Mother, Mary Wilmot came home just now."</p> 
               <p>"You don't say so, James! I declare! where did she come from, and how did she come?"</p> 
               <p>"She came from somewhere between here and Kennebec, I presume, mother. And, as to the how, it was in a light wagon, driven by a young gentleman with a<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6274-00000072"/> black coat, white neckerchief, ditto hair, and blue eyes," replied James, curtly.</p> 
               <p>"O!" said the unsuspicious and unobservant dame, "that must have been her cousin, that she's engaged to marry. Why didn't she stop with us?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't know, mother. I had no chance to speak to her."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed!" rejoined the dame, struck with a momentary wonder as to what might have been the obstacles in the way. But she was too sleepy to follow up the inquiry, and only added, "Well, she'll come over to see us in the morning, no doubt."</p> 
               <p>So they parted for the night; and James, repeating to himself, as he went up-stairs, "She'll come over to see us in the morning, no doubt," blew out his candle after lighting a cigar, and drawing a chair to his chamber window, put his feet up on the sill, and gave himself up to thought, for he felt no inclination either to read or sleep.</p> 
               <p>It was a sluggish and listless evening still. The stars shone dreamily through the thin veil of vapor which the earth had been perspiring from every pore all day into the air. The yellowish track of the road lay, like a faint-hued ribbon, up and down the bank of the stream. Here and there, a detached tree or cottage showed a hazy outline against some marked background; but the little valley lay like an inscrutable phantom under, the drowsy shadows, faintly suggesting an invisible landscape. On the summits of the hills that hemmed it around, the undulating tree-tops met the sky-line, in shadow rendered deeper by the contact of the partially illuminated heavens. All else was sombre vacancy, except the faint reflection from the river under the twinkle of the stars. There was nothing ing to be heard, but at intervals, the barking of a dog or the low tinkle of a cow-bell, save the distant plunge of the water over the mill-dams and the murmur of the stream below, giving out a monotone so undefined and continuous as scarcely to seem a sound, and attracting the permanent attention of the ear hardly more than the soft sighings of the light evening breeze.</p> 
               <p>The deep, calm quiet soon soothed the tumultuous heart of Butler; and when he had finished his cigar, he had reached, through a tangle of thoughts which we shall not attempt to describe, certain conclusions, neither very profound nor satisfactory, but seemingly all that were then attainable.</p> 
               <p>First, he settled, to his own mind, that Mary Wilmot was worthy of any man's admiration and love.</p> 
               <p>Secondly, that all appearances indicated that she was betrothed to her cousin.</p> 
               <p>Thirdly, that all he could do was to wait and see what time would disclose.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile, Mary herself was sitting at a window not forty rods across the river, but, for any practical purpose, as far as if the Atlantic rolled between them. She was not engaged to the rival who was causing Butler so much uneasiness; nor had she ever dreamed of being so. On the contrary, no small portion of the pleasure she had felt in returning home, arose from the knowledge, derived from the letters of her friends, that James was in Merrifield once more; and she felt, though she hardly dared confess it to her own heart, that her recollection of her childhood's playfellow still remained the brightest and dearest of her fancies. Disappointed in not recognizing his face among those of her other acquaintances in the street, though it had been present to her imagination throughout the wearisome<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6274-00000073"/> some journey, she sat for some time in the little parlor of the inn, in a fluttered expectation of his coming, which was rendered more confident by the information, soon obtained from her other visitors, that he was in the immediate neighborhood.</p> 
               <p>When her expectation had gradually faded into hopelessness, she withdrew to her chamber with a weary feeling of perplexity and mortification, made more painful by the vividly renewed recollection of the happy anticipations she had tacitly indulged through the tedious day's ride. Overcome, at once, by the fatigue heretofore postponed by the excitement of her return, and the sickening revulsion of her hopes, she threw herself at the bedside and burst into a torrent of bitter tears. But, as her wounded feelings recovered from the first shock, she wiped the tears away, and sat calmly down to combat the first serious grief that had stained her young life.</p> 
               <p>"How foolish and wrong I have been," she sought to reason with herself, "to think that he must care for me still, because he loved me when we were children together! He is grown into a man, and is probably absorbed with ideas far beyond the sphere of this little place. He has spent four years in the company of women far more accomplished no doubt, all of them, and some probably more attractive in every way, than I can pretend to be; and why should I expect that he would have remembered me, because I have been unwisely cherishing his image in my humble seclusion? Perhaps he is not only entirely indifferent to me, but has purposely delayed meeting me, as the most delicate way of showing me that I have no claim on his special regard. Or, if not intentional, it is proof enough that he has no particular thought of me. And I cannot complain. I had no right to expect anything else; but I could not help it, the thought <emph>would</emph> come. Indeed, it has never left me since he kissed me, when he said good-by. It is plain at least what I have to do; and that is to forget my folly forever."</p> 
               <p>After a few moments of sad retrospection upon the sunny days of childhood, in every hour of which her bright and manly playmate was the central image, she dismissed the once delightful but now painful subject with an effort, said her nightly prayer, and sought to rest her weary body and spirit in slumber.</p> 
               <p>The first dawn of day awoke the troubled girl, and recalled, with consciousness, the galling sting of humiliation and sorrow. She could not bear to expose her deep dejection to the eyes of the village, and especially of Butler and his mother. Therefore she called her cousin, and begged him to drive her to her home, some ten miles up the river, instead of leaving her at Merrifield, as had been proposed, until her father could come for her. She accounted for the change of plan, by pleading exhaustion from yesterday's exposure, and her desire to accomplish her journey before the day became hot again. As her companion was able to pursue his intended progress eastward with little additional travel, by taking a by-road over the plains, nearly as direct and quite as passable as the sea-shore route, he readily assented.</p> 
               <p>Butler too had slumbered lightly, and awoke at break of day, and, while awaiting breakfast, threw many a glance across the river, inwardly determined to learn from Mary herself all that she might please to disclose, as soon as propriety permitted him to present himself. But, before the sun peeped over the eastern hills, he saw, with surprise and mortification, the two travellers<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6274-00000074"/> leave the tavern together in their wagon and take the road up the opposite bank of the stream. This abrupt departure convinced him that his suspicions were well founded. "There is no doubt left now," reflected he. "All she cares for is in that wagon with her, and she does not even stop to shake hands with me." So he turned away, vexed and gloomy. Thus, two hearts that yearned for each other were sundered, in mutual suffering, by untoward circumstances misinterpreted, and sensitive delicacy morbidly indulged, when half a dozen words of frank explanation would have set everything right. The like often happens in this cross-grained world. A large part of our difficulties and vexations are simply misunderstandings of ourselves or our neighbors.</p> 
               <p>At the breakfast table Mrs. Butler observed James's abstracted air and want of appetite; and the limited perspicacity of the excellent old lady ascribed it at once to sickness. Her maternal fears led her immediately into a long series of conjectures and an equally long catalogue of remedies,-ending with a recommendation, safe in any possible case, that he should return directly to his bed. After some trouble, by alternate ridicule and strenuous denial, her son silenced if he did not remove her anxiety, and was permitted to account for his lack of appetite by the unusual heat of the weather.</p> 
               <p>"Well, my son, if you are sure you are not sick, please run across the bridge and ask Mary to come over and stay till she wishes to go home."</p> 
               <p>"Mary is gone home, mother. They started an hour ago."</p> 
               <p>"Goodness gracious! if that an't queer! But it can't be that Mary would go without coming to see us, -after being away for months. What makes you think she is gone?"</p> 
               <p>"I saw them go with my own eyes, mother."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I wouldn't have believed it. Mary never was in Merrifield before without coming here. She always called me Aunt, you know; and I'm sure I always felt as if she was my own daughter."</p> 
               <p>These comments of his mother of course added to Butler's confidence in his own views of the matter, as well as not a little to his soreness of heart. After a vain attempt to give his attention to a book, he was fain to go out in the hope of relieving his irritation by active exercise; while his mother, though sorely puzzled, turned also to her regular occupations for the day.</p> 
               <p>A few days after, a note arrived from Mary which further confirmed all parties in their impressions,-simply because she had, as was natural enough, guarded herself carefully from any reference to the interesting questions; and her silence was construed into an informal admission of everything of which a denial would have been desirable. It ran thus:-</p>

The truth is, that I was worn out with the journeying in the heat all the way from Bucksport on that dreadful day, and thought it best to get home in the cool of the morning, for fear that I should be altogether done up.

               <p>James brought the letter to his mother, and heard it read with a suppressed sigh. The allusion to the agreeable sojourn at the Kennebec and the curt mention of himself seemed to stamp his surmises with the seal of certainty; for he attributed the indefiniteness of the explanation to a willingness to avoid all explanation upon a subject that might be both delicate and disagreeable,-all which was true enough, but for very different reasons from those which he was disposed to conjecture. He made no comments; and his mother laid the letter on her knee, and sat for some moments in silent meditation. At last she looked up and said,-</p> 
               <p>"What do you think of Mary's letter, James?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't see that there is much in it to think about, mother."</p> 
               <p>"Well," continued Mrs. Butler, "it's strange to me as all the rest. Why didn't Mary tell me of her engagement? she knows how much I think of her. I used to think that you and she would marry, my son; and I can't help feeling disappointed. I will ask her all about it the next time I see her."</p> 
               <p>"Pray don't, mother. If she doesn't choose to mention it, for any reason, it would not be proper for us to ask questions."</p> 
               <p>"I don't see why not, my son. She can answer as she pleases."</p> 
               <p>"No,-you must promise me that you won't say a word more about it, dear mother. If Mary ever had any such idea as you say you have had, it would put me in a very ridiculous and disagreeable position. We shall know in good time, and it is no concern of ours. Now promise me, mother, not to talk of it with Mary."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Butler reluctantly promised. Not that she precisely understood James's objections; but she supposed that he must be right, of course, and could not withstand his urgency. So this note written, no doubt, with much misgiving and awkwardness on poor Mary's part, served but to induce James to shut and bolt the door already half closed between them.</p> 
               <p>Some weeks after, Mary made a visit to Merrifield, and entered Mrs. Butler's familiar parlor in a most uncomfortable mixture of trepidation, reluctance, and pleasure. She was cordially welcomed by her old friend, whom she also had dearly loved from childhood. But both soon felt themselves under a distressing restraint, all the more awkward and painful, that reserve was alien to the frank and open natures of each of them, and had never before chilled their intercourse. They felt mutually embarrassed upon the subject nearest to the heart of both. Mary dared not introduce James's name, for fear of betraying her feelings; neither could she contradict the report of her engagement,-which had now reached her ears,-to him or his mother, without laying herself open to the suspicion of a purpose, the imputation of which would be humiliation not to be borne, however her happiness might be involved in it. The old lady, on her part, fettered by her promise to her son, did not venture to allude to the subject for fear of offending his scruples, which were even more sacred and imposing to her because she did not at all comprehend them. The very idea of diplomacy and concealment was fearful to her transparent simplicity; and she was hopelessly perplexed<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6274-00000076"/> by the annoying secret difficulty which she could neither forget nor remove. Each hoped momentarily that the solution of the mystery might be offered by the other; but explanation was impossible to both.</p> 
               <p>The kind old lady, however, urged her young friend to remain with her for the day with so much earnestness, that she, half joyfully, half reluctantly consented. It happened unfortunately that James had gone out in ignorance of Mary's arrival. Still more unluckily, he had found an errand to be done, at a little distance, and sent world that he should not be at home to dinner. The excited young guest had been, for some time, sitting in tremulous anticipation of his entrance, and the message fell upon her heart like a death-chill. She instantly convinced herself, with the self-torturing ingenuity that so often leads us to take for granted what we dread, that Butler was determined to avoid her. Mrs. Butler, too, could not but feel that it had something to do with her son's strange remonstrances, and added by her constraint and evident discomposure to the impression. The poor girl sat in an agony of mortification and misery, till she could bear it no longer; and then, excusing herself on the score of headache,-if excuse it were, when both head and heart ached to bursting,-cut short her wretched stay, and hastened her departure home. "He loves some beautiful Boston girl," she moaned to herself, "and thinks it perhaps the kindest thing he can do to let me know that he can never care for me. And perhaps it is kind to him, but O! how hard to bear! "So she returned half broken-hearted, to bury her sorrow in the seclusion of her home, till she could master a feeling which, from the fondest hope of life, had been changed to bitterness and humiliation.</p> 
                
               <p>Nor was Butler a whit less successful in self-deception. When he heard from his mother of Mary's hurried leave-taking, he took it for granted that she abridged the obligatory visit in order to forestall his return. Matters were thus involved, all round, in still deeper mystification. Accident would, without doubt, have cleared up the game of cross purposes before long, but that Mr. Wilmot's farm was in a remote corner, at a considerable distance from the village, with which intercourse was rare and difficult. As Mary now studiously confined herself at home, and other members of the family seldom left it,-while Butler's pride would not permit him to force himself upon her retirement,-there was no further communication between the two households for along time. Mrs. Butler wondered and wondered to herself what was the matter; but she was about as likely to undertake a journey to the North Pole as to Mr. Wilmot's forest clearing.</p> 
               <p>Dame Rumor too, who is sure to take such matters in hand, especially in small communities,-besides the general unreliability of that venerable gossip,-was, in this case, specially sure to be at fault. In the first place, there was the report from the Kennebec, substantiated to all appearance beyond reasonable doubt by the arrival of Mary, under the escort of her supposed lover. The fiction, too, was greedily believed by all the maids and matrons of Merrifield, because Mary was a formidable rival to the best of them in matrimonial schemes in general, and the well-known early attachment between her and James lent an irresistible strength to the predisposition; for Butler was far the richest prize in the neighborhood. It was a great relief to the feminine half of the community to believe that a young lady so dangerous was withdrawn from<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6274-00000077"/> the market. Wives and sisters, too, easily persuaded husbands and brothers, if they troubled their heads at all concerning the matter, that they knew all about it, especially when backed by such plausible premises. Therefore it was unanimously and conclusively settled that Mary was appropriated by the young minister. If she herself was ever questioned upon the point by doubting curiosity, her consciousness of the notoriety of the former relations between her and James instantly led her to think that the inquiry was made with a reference to him; and her consequent confusion and blushing awkwardness made her denial appear like anything but refutation of the common belief. The disavowal was imputed to shyness, coquetry, some unknown motive of secrecy, to anything, in short but that it was the truth. Thus everything conspired to build up and make impregnable and fancied barrier between the lovers. It was not strange, then, that for months no explanation should occur of the universal blunder. There never was a lie better proved.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head> 
               <p>THE long hot days of summer had passed quietly away, and the atmosphere began to show signs of approaching winter. Long nights and shortened days materially diminished the power of the sun's rays. Mornings and evenings were cool, and now and then, to a slight degree, frosty, and the air in general clear and bracing. Yet, in unclouded weather, the brilliant sun gave to noonday a warmth sometimes little interior to that of summer, but free from its sultry temperature. For the surface of the earth was dry, and vegetation had began to ripen and wither.</p> 
               <p>There is no weather more delicious than that of early autumn in Northern America. Cloudless skies, cool, clear breezes, and bright sunshine make it bland and luxurious, without the intensity that renders midsummer enfeebling and oppressive.</p> 
               <p>It was a fine morning in the middle of September; and the widow Butler's household were astir, as usual, with the dawn of day. While breakfast was in preparation, James superintended the out-door duties of the farmland, and, this daily business finished, stood watching the eastern horizon, now glowing with the tints of sunrise. The faint rose-colored cloud of transparent light that lay upon the eastern hills, deepened and brightened, till the dark tops of the pines and hemlocks were set in a bordering halo of flashing gold.<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6274-00000078"/> The actual appearance of the sun at length rendered the gorgeous brilliancy no longer endurable to mortal eyes; and James turned into the house, resolving to improve the promise of a delicious day in a ramble into the forest with his rifle.</p> 
               <p>"Mother," said he as he rose from table, "I think I will go and kill you a deer to-day. The version is in prime order now, and I fancy you have not been as well supplied, during my absence, as you used to be. For my part, I should like a juicy streak or a fat haunch right well."</p> 
               <p>"You always loved running about in the woods, James; I don't see why, for they're dreadful dark and gloomy, and it's terrible hard walking. But you and I are different, and it's a beautiful day."</p> 
               <p>Satisfied with these two plain conclusions, the old lady sat down to her knitting-work, casting, every few moments, a superintending glance at the rosy damsel who was clearing away the breakfast table. James arrayed himself in a snug, stout frock, into the ample pockets of which he stowed a slight luncheon, his, apparatus for kindling fire and his long, knee hunting-knife. Then, taking his rifle from its hooks and throwing the powder-horn and bullet-pouch over his shoulders, he turned to the door.</p> 
               <p>"Good-by, mother. I may be back to night, but don't frizzle to death, if I shouldn't come. I have not had a hunting frolic for a long time, and shall take it fair and easy. You know I don't mind a night in the woods, through you think them so awful. Besides, I mean to ask Captain Dee to accompany me. I like the old gentleman right well, and I shall pass directly by his door. So to-night or to-morrow will be all the same. But I'll bring you a tip-top deer, at any rate, unless uncle's ledgers have taken all the wood-craft out of me, which I don't think."</p> 
               <p>He examined carefully, while he spoke, the condition of his valued old friend in lock, stock, and barrel, and smiled in the confidence that all was right, and that he could use it skillfully as it deserved. Perhaps, also, part of the smile might be appropriated to his mother's simple horror of the forest wilderness.</p> 
               <p>"Good-by, my son," replied the dame; "take care of yourself, and, mind, don't take cold, if you do sleep out."</p> 
               <p>James smiled again, as he said to himself, "I wonder what mother thinks I can do in that last matter. I guess uncle would say 'twas worth a guaranty commission to undertake to prevent the dew's falling or the forest's being a trifle cool of an autumn night." Then, taking his way across the rough bridge and through the straggling street that ran up the riverside, he soon left the little village behind him, and, ascending the bluff that walled the northern end of the valley, emerged upon a tract where only an occasional clearing, here and there, attested the approach of civilization. Upon one of these outskirting farms, lived Captain Dee, and Butler's active steps soon brought him to his door.</p> 
               <p>The veteran was seated upon a chopping-block in the yard, enjoying his pipe and the serene beauty of the landscape that stretched away to the river in the front of him, bathed in the clear light of that bright morning. He welcomed his visitor, who had always been, a great favorite with him, with hearty cordiality, and readily assented to the proposed excursion.</p> 
               <p>"Here, William!" shouted he,-calling his son, a lad of sixteen, from the neighboring field,-"here's<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6274-00000079"/> James Butler. Now you've shaken hands, get ready to go with us, if you choose. We can all talk as we go along."</p> 
               <p>While William and his father are making their preparations, we will introduce them more formally.</p> 
               <p>William Dee the senior was-as his usual designation of Captain intimated-a retired shipmaster; one of a class of men who generally illustrated all the most valuable traits of New England character. He had spent his youth and mature manhood upon the ocean, and, in the service of merchants of Boston, visited in various capacities almost every country accessible to mercantile enterprise. Energetic, active, shrewd, and upright, he had done full justice to the interests committed to his care; and his employers had amassed wealth from the fruit of his labors. He might easily have made for himself an ample fortune. But he was too impulsively liberal and open-handed, too much disposed to enjoy the good things of life freely, as they came along, to accumulate money for its own sake. If he had but a single dollar in his pocket, he would give half of it to the first man that asked for it, and spent the other half for a good dinner, if it came in his way,-without inquiring whether the object of his bounty were deserving or not, and without a thought where his own supper was to come from. He had, therefore, retired from business with a very moderate competence, not sufficient to meet the luxurious expenditure of large cities. Desirous of passing his remaining days in ease and quiet, and being fond of rural amusements, he had purchased a farm in this retired spot. Here he lived in simple and unostentatious comfort, making his moderate income more than sufficient for his wants by the cultivation of his land, which supplied him and William-the only members of his household excepting his hired man and housekeeper-with the great staples of subsistence.</p> 
               <p>The Captain's personal appearance corresponded with his character. Rather short and stout, but well made and athletic, his open features, full blue eye, and ruddy complexion showed that he appreciated and enjoyed all the comforts of life, without any unnecessary cares or anxieties being permitted to cloud the passing day. He had nothing of the thoughtful, hard-worked air so common with his countrymen; but wore habitually the bluff, frank, and hearty demeanor of the well-fed Englishman. The kindliness and generosity of his character beamed from his countenance, and shed a general serenity upon his temper. He could easily be roused by manifested wrong-doing to a warm and boisterous indignation; but malice or abiding ill-humor were not among the possibilities of his nature. One habit he had,-contracted from his long experience of the rough chances and rude companionship of a seafaring life,-an inveterate trick of ornamenting his discourse with a superfluity of expletives, especially in moments of excitement. To tell the plain truth, the good Captain swore rather severely. Yet, though offensive to taste and sometimes to more serious considerations, it could not impress any one who knew him with the idea of intentional irreverence or bad temper. It was the unregulated ebullition of impulsive and careless boisterousness,-a sort of safety-value to the overflowing animal spirits and the quick, warm rush of his ideas, unchecked by prudence or calculation, a recklessness of manner much more than a sin.</p> 
               <p>We shall have more regard to the Captain's dignity and genuine worth than he had himself, and purpose to<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6274-00000080"/> soften down and extenuate, as we proceed, the graphic and racy, but scarcely decorous garniture of his speech.</p> 
               <p>William, his intelligent face beaming with anticipated pleasure, brought his father's rifle with its proper accompaniments, together with a lighter double-barreled gun for his own use.</p> 
               <p>"Well, James, my lad, how long a trip do you proposed to make of it?"</p> 
               <p>"Very much as you please, Captain. We will get back to-night if you prefer; for perhaps you don't feel like such long routes as we used to make together, five or six years ago. If you like to camp out, I told mother not to worry about me if she did not see me to-night."</p> 
               <p>"You are grown so stout and tail, my boy, that I suppose you can outwork me now, but I don't grow old very fast. I never abused the body that God gave me, and am now reaping the reward of my wisdom in a green and active old age. I'm good for a tough job yet,-thank Heaven! And old Polly is the only one to worry after Bill and me; and it's little she troubles herself out of her kitchen affairs,-for which Heaven be thanked again! One of your coddling old crones would fidget me to death. If the wolves were to eat us up, I do believe the old devil would only wonder how they could devour such a tough old fellow as I, without boiling or roasting. So let's go, and get back when we are ready. But you had better put some bread and cheese into your pockets, Bill. Hunters ought to kill their own grub; but I've no idea of going without dinner, if the deer prove shy. By the way, too"-</p> 
               <p>The old gentleman here interrupted himself to open a closet, where stood a portly demijohn, from which he filled a pocket flask with some genuine old brandy. The temperance doctrines were not taught in those days; and if they had been, we do not think the Captain would have gone for total abstinence.</p> 
               <p>"This confounded brook-water is all the better for a dash of good Cognac. But such things are like powder, boys,-to be handled carefully. Too heavy a charge spoils the aim, and kicks you over."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head> 
               <p>THE party now left the house and struck into the winding path, hardly deserving the name of a road, which led up the stream. As they ascended a gentle slope, the Captain stopped to look back upon the prospect below.</p> 
               <p>"By Jove, James, this is a glorious day, and I think this landscape pleasanter than the view down Cornhill. What do you say?"</p> 
               <p>"It certainly is so to me, for it is my home; and I confess I do not like city life. There is too much restraint and ceremony, too much sameness and confinement, for my taste. I love this free air and wide range. I can do what I please, and nobody minds me; go where I please, and nobody finds fault. A man is more a man here, if he is less a gentleman,-and that he needn't be."</p> 
               <p>"No,-no. A man may be a gentleman everywhere; whether his boots are blacked with Day &amp; Martin, or daubed with 'Guagus clay. There is, as you say, a pleasant freedom about our simple life here. A scene like this has more of the grand and picturesque, too, than a country that has been smoothed off and tamed down by man's labor."</p> 
               <p>The scene upon which they were looking, was indeed striking. At their feet lay the little straggling village of comfortable but unpretending cottages, surrounded by fields of grass or other crops, among which rose, at intervals, the blackened stumps of the former occupants of the soil. Irregular fences, of such materials as were at hand, protected them from the cattle. Here a row of bristling roots, set with their prongs in the air,-there a hedge of brush, topped with riders of spruce poles,-in another place a barricade of slabs from the saw-mill,-and now and then a regular construction of cedar rails and posts, or of small trees laid in zigzag, marked the boundaries of the inclosures. Little clumps of silver firs or young birches were sprinkled about the cleared lands, as if the native forest, loath to leaves its ancient seat, was struggling desperately with the innovations of the farmer. Below soft, sloping banks, or between abrupt bluffs of clay, the little river glided murmuring on, widening out gradually as it neared the sea. Its embouchure was glittering in the morning sun at a distance of about five miles. In several of the bends within sight, the stream fell in cascades over the ledges, across which log-dams had been constructed; and where the wheels of the saw-mills were seen flashing through the tumbling spray, and the sharp crash of the saws in the pine logs came, softened by distance, on the breeze, like a giant's whisper. The picture was bordered everywhere by the forest, principally of dark evergreens, variegated here and there with birch, maples, and beeches, that were now beginning to assume their gorgeous autumnal liverly of brown, scarlet, and gold. Away up the rising slopes swelled the boundless woods. The summits of the hills were mantled entirely with the foliage of the hard-wood trees, now displaying every tint of the rainbow. Far off above the hill-tops, beyond the wide expanse of leaves, Humpback Mountain lifted his forehead into the clear<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6274-00000082"/> air, like a distant island from an ocean rolling in long, sweeping waves. An atmosphere of perfect purity shed over all a coloring of the highest brilliancy, in the open grounds and sky; while the heavy masses and impenetrable shadows of the forest deepened the tone of the whole with contrasted shades of imposing grandeur and effect. There was enough of civilization to give animation and human sympathy to the scene, as the eye dwelt upon the easy sweep of the fields and their simple homesteads; enough of rough and uneven transitionary character to impart the highest degree of picturesque beauty, which was reflected back again from the sparkling river, with its graceful bends, its deep, still pools, its rippling eddies, and its tumbling falls. At either verge, Nature displayed her noblest elements of sublimity in the broad expanse of the Atlantic, shining under the morning sun, and the deep-bosomed and limitless woods, with their mountain crown, extending inland far beyond the power of vision.</p> 
               <p>The river, as it stole from the dark border of the trees, seemed to emerge into a new life, and to be a link between two worlds. And so in truth it was. On the one hand, lay mute and solitary and wildly majestic, unprogressive Nature, as in the day of her creation. On the other, stripped of the veil of uncounted centuries, she was yielding to the warm impulses of intellect a new existence; she, the unchangeable, becoming the theatre and beautiful medium of incessant change, and giving forth, to the earnest demand of her master-spirit, the rich treasures of her secret bosom.</p> 
               <p>After a few moments' contemplation, the party turned again to the northward and pursued their journey ney. Young William was soon in advance with his dog, scrutinizing the thickets and wood-paths for partridges on which to try his marksmanship. The other two proceeded more deliberately, chatting as they walked along.</p> 
               <p>"Don't you mean to return to the counting-room, then, James?" said Dee.</p> 
               <p>"No, not I. I prefer to live here with my mother. I suppose most people will think me a great fool; for my uncle makes me very kind and liberal offers."</p> 
               <p>"Well, my boy, I shall be right glad to have your society here; but I am not sure that I don't think you a fool myself, to give up such a chance for this wilderness. You might make a handsome fortune in ten or fifteen years, and then do just as you pleased."</p> 
               <p>"I can do what I please now," replied the youth laughing, "without any trouble at all; a for I am wise enough to please to do what I can easily. What good, then, to spend the flower of my life, at the sacrifice of all my favorite pursuits and pleasures, to earn what I do not want, and shall have lost all capacity and inclination to enjoy when I have earned it?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, well, that isn't a thousand miles from the truth, either. If we are contented, happy, and useful, by Jupiter, I don't know what more we can do. And it is more, a good deal, than most people contrive to do in this world."</p> 
               <p>"I sha'n't forfeit your good opinion, then, if I neglect the chance of becoming a member of the firm of Butler &amp; Co. and coming out, twenty years hence, too rich to work, and too industrious by habit to be happy without it; too fat and lazy to shoot or fish, and too restless to do nothing; too active in mind to be unemployed, and yet respecting no books but a journal and ledger.-What do you say about it?"</p> 
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6274-00000083"/> 
               <p>"I say that I like you very well as you are, and as you are likely to be here. If you are suited with such a position, there is no wisdom in seeking another, that may not, take it all in all, be a better or a happier one. But it is a question for you to decide for yourself. I will only advise you to consider it well before you do decide; and God bless you, my boy, do what you may."</p> 
               <p>A hearty shake of the hand was interchanged between the friends; and the conversation turned upon the objects of their excursion. They were now travelling over the barren plains, mostly covered with low copes of birth bushes, or the still humbler growth of whortleberry, sweet-fern, and brakes. A brisk walk of something more than two hours brought them to the farther edge of the barrens, where the character of the vegetation indicated the change of soil. The tall trunks of the red pine began to rear their purplish brown columns into the air about them, now singly, now in groups, and at length in heavy and extensive glades. The short, snappish rustle of the wind, in bush and brake, was superseded by the heavy, surging murmur of the tree-tops, where, more than a hundred feet above their heads, the stiff tassels tossed in the autumn breeze. A kindred and very similar reverberation now began to break upon their ears, distinguishable from the wind chiefly by its unbroken and continuous rush of sound. It was the roar of the distant river, which here crossed their track. The noise of its waters chafing over long rapids, pervaded the atmosphere, like the full, energetic tramp of an impetuous march, to which the deep rolling bursts from the waving foliage overhead formed a fitful and harmonizing accompaniment; till the tremulous lous air was transformed into one concert of majestic music. A short space brought them to the banks of the stream, at the head of the great falls. The river, here about two hundred feet wide, was fordable almost anywhere, in ordinary stages of the water. But the masses of rock projecting above the surface at this spot, arresting the logs in tangled rafts as they floated down the stream, commonly afforded a rough but safe bridge for the passage of pedestrians. Such was the case now; and James and the Captain made their way, over irregular piles of timber, to a broad platform clustered around a huge boulder near the centre of the water-course. Here they seated themselves with a common impulse, and gazed for some moments in silence at the scene below them.</p> 
               <p>The current forced its broken way over and through continuous ledges, crowned here and there with masses of scattered rocks, that rose like the disjointed ruins of a gigantic wall from the foaming waters. Now the concentrated stream poured, in a black and glassy rush, through deep channels overhung by frowning battlements; now it trickled in broken and frittered threads over flat and jagged surfaces, to plunge again into cavernous depths. Here it wheeled in circling sweeps around obstructing masses; there it poured in frothing confusion among less elevated and sparser impediments. Deep eddies, where the troubled waters seemed to retire for a time to regain strength for the fierce struggle, reflected the peaceful image of the September sky, whence the restless current again shot out to dash itself in renewed fury over the rough and tangled path below. Sometimes the smooth and placid surface betrayed, only by the rapid passage of a fallen leaf or broken branch, the impetuous momentum that<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6274-00000084"/> bore along its apparently slumbering tide; sometimes every foot of its course bore testimony of its fierce and struggling progress, in boiling circles and furious leaps, that recoiled in gurgling spray to their starting-point. As far as the eye could reach, the river's bed was full of precipices, rugged rocks, and raging waters.</p> 
               <p>The banks of the stream were lined with trees of various species, but chiefly of the resinous kinds. Dark hemlocks, with their fan-like masses of foliage, pyramidal spruces and firs, tall and stately pines, with here and there a birch, maple, or beech, rose in thick ranks upon the slopes and top of the banks. At the level of the water, cedars shot up wherever a little nook afforded them chance to root. Frequently, insinuating themselves into crannies of the ledges and driven from the perpendicular by beetling rocks and overhanging shelves, they bent in graceful curves over the water, connected with the shore only at the extreme trunk and dipping their drooping branches in the stream.</p> 
               <p>A kingfisher was employed in looking after his dinner among the pools and eddies; and a hawk was circling high up in the air, screaming at every revolution of his sweeping flight. Otherwise, all was still and motionless, except the roar of the water and the rustling of the trees in the occasional swells of the wind.</p> 
               <p>Captain Dee laid down his gun, and, producing his tinder-box and pipe, prepared to indulge himself in smoking during their rest.</p> 
               <p>"We have had a smart walk, James; and I think, by Jove, we can't do better than sit here awhile and enjoy this glorious scene. Meanwhile, I'll have a smoke. William, boy-like, is ranging ahead of us still. But he'll take care of himself. How strange it is that all men, both civilized and savage, that can muster a pipe and any sort of weed which will serve the purpose, have universally adopted smoking as a luxury and refreshment! It is the emblem of peace and friendship, of repose and enjoyment, everywhere, King James to the contrary notwithstanding. There's no prospect to be seen in Cornhill like this,-they, my boy?"</p> 
               <p>"No, indeed, Captain, man can do nothing towards creating such an one, and nothing to add to its beauty. In fact, the great charm of it, to my mind, is its thorough isolation from man and his works. It is pure, original nature. No human being has ever traced or rubbed out a line of the picture; but the first man that ever saw it, saw it as we do now. I don't wonder that the old poets fancied they could see Naiads, Hamadryads, and other fanciful beings in such spots as this. They have a character entirely peculiar; and we might expect their inhabitants to be so too."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and so they are, and be d--d to 'em!" responded Dee. "Here's a black fly been dancing round my nose ever since we've been here. If it weren't for the frosty nights we have had, we couldn't live an hour on this rock; they'd devour us. But as for your wood and water nymphs, I don't know where you will look for them, unless a copper-colored one will serve your turn; and even they are getting to be rare."</p> 
               <p>"I suppose I have a little the advantage of you in romance, Captain. I have not weathered so many storms as you. But does not a perfectly wild landscape, like this make a stronger impression upon you than any other?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it does, my boy; and the flies are not a bit<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6274-00000085"/> behind the scenery in that respect." The Captain here made a fierce plunge at his puny tormentor. "But you are right. It's like looking back to the creation, and behind the first beginnings of human society. Besides, this primitive nature is both beautiful and grand."</p> 
               <p>"It produces upon my mind, Captain, a feeling both of awe and admiration. It is the incarnation of power and infinity, for we can see no end or limit. It is the same to us, as if this forest covered the universe. Then this awful quiet, not a sound, but very rarely, of living thing. It is strange to us busy mortals, and as impressive as strange; as if it hid some dread mystery. It is like standing, as Adam did before other men existed, along with Providence and God. It carries us back to the first principles of our being, and abrogates all our artificial ideas. I always wish I was a poet or a painter, or both, when I get among these wild places. But your pipe is smoked out; and we have our dinner to earn yet. I sha'n't fancy crackers and cheese, if a deer is to be had."</p> 
               <p>"Let's be going, then. But when I get with you, I am full of gossip. Our neighbors generally don't trouble their heads much with speculation; and as for old Poll,-hang her, she's worse than an Indian squaw. I saw William pop over several partridges as we came along; so you need not come down to bread and cheese. I heard him fire on the other side of the river just now, and shouldn't wonder if he has killed a deer. He's a keen shot for a youngster."</p> 
               <p>They now picked their way across the stranded logs to the farther shore. Butler's whistle soon brought to them Marquis, a beautiful white and liver-colored spaniel,-William's pet and inseparable companion. Following the dog, as he bounded on before them, they entered the forest, and soon found the lad employed in dressing a fine buck that had fallen a victim to his aim.</p> 
               <p>"William has the first deer, sure enough, Captain. I am not often behind in this matter; but I must be content with second best now."</p> 
               <p>"A nice fat fellow,-two years and in prime order," said the Captain, glancing at his antlers. "He will give us as much as we shall want to carry home, and a good dinner to boot."</p> 
               <p>"So he will; but I must try my hand too, if we chance upon more. We could put them up in a tree and come out with a horse to-morrow. The next thing now is to choose a place to dine."</p> 
               <p>"There is a monstrous boulder over the ridge, and a brook hard by;-couldn't be a nicer spot."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I remember it, William. Let us go there, Captain. Bill, take this fellow's fore-legs, and I will carry the hinder ones; he will be light now that you have dressed him."</p> 
               <p>Just in advance of where they stood, the ground rose in a long and moderate slope, covered with hard wood, spruce, and hemlock. On the further side, it descended more steeply to a narrow valley, through which ran a small brook on its way to the river. Another narrow and rounded ridge,-or horseback, as it would be there styled, from the resemblance of its conformation,-ran at right angles a short distance out into the valley, like a causeway, and terminated in a gravelly mound or knoll. Nearly upon the highest point of the little hill rested a huge mass of granite, in size and general outline resembling a small house without the roof. Its sides were nearly perpendicular and<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6274-00000086"/> smooth, except on one end, where some slight projections, caused by the disintegration of a seam in its structure, afforded footing sufficient to enable an active man,-with the help of the contiguous branches of a cluster of birches,-to scale its top, elsewhere inaccessible to man or beast. Covered with gray mosses and lichens, the vast rock lay, like the ark on Ararat, where the waters of the primeval flood, or some travelling glacier of olden days, had left it stranded. Upon the dry surface of the knoll beneath it was a small, clear spot, well fitted for the purpose for which William Dee had suggested it.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head> 
               <p>THE young men soon kindled a fire under the side of the rock, and broiled upon the coals a fat venison steak, which, with the accompaniments supplied by coat-pockets, furnished a dinner that might satisfy the most fastidious appetite. Marquis,-who had lain, during the progress of the meal, with his head quietly resting upon his paws, like a well-bred dog patiently biding his time,-had retired round a corner with a superabundant supply of bones and scraps dealt out to him by his biped friends. The Captain was enjoying his pipe; and a desultory conversation, such as suits the inert mood that follows a hearty repast, was kept up for some time. The sun was bright, and light fleecy clouds floated along on the fresh breeze, which was only recognized, however, in the shelter of the woods, by an occasional rustling whirl of the leaves that began already to fall from the trees, and the continuous moaning of the tall tops of the pines far overhead. A merry little squirrel now and then trilled out his frolicsome chirrup, as he basked or scampered about in enjoyment of the lingering atmosphere of summer; for Marquis was both too well trained to higher game, and too agreeably occupied, to interrupt him.</p> 
               <p>All at once the quiet scene was disturbed by a loud, sharp challenge from the dog,-who sprang round<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6274-00000087"/> from the corner, where he had been maundering over the more refractory portions of his dinner, and stood with erect tail and ears, snuffing the air and growling furiously. The little squirrel rushed in consternation up a neighboring tree; while William and Butler, springing to their feet, seized their guns, and the Captain took his pipe from his mouth.</p> 
               <p>"What is it, boy?" said William, as all three looked and listened earnestly towards the quarter to which the dog directed their attention; "what do you hear, boy?"</p> 
               <p>A moment more made audible, to their less acute senses, a pattering tramp as of many animals in rapid motion. Directly in front of them, the sound suddenly ceased, and was succeeded by a chorus of yelps and snarling.</p> 
               <p>"The wolves have smelt out the entrails of your deer, William, and are quarreling over them. We can get a good shot while they are in the muss. Your father and Marquis will do better to stay here."</p> 
               <p>With quick but careful steps, the young men ran towards the top of the ridge; thence proceeding in perfect stillness, they gained the covert of a thicket of young firs, which protected them from discovery, while, by circumspect improvement of casual openings, they could see most that was going on in their front.</p> 
               <p>In the open glade beyond, where the refuse portions of the deer had been left, were from forty to fifty wolves. Some were sitting upon their haunches; Some wandered about snuffing for a stray mouthful; and a dozen or more were still clustered where the heap of garbage had been, snapping and growling at each other, under the influence of the feelings excited by their tantalized and wholly unsated appetite. After peeping through his loop-hole at this wild scene, William leveled his gun; but Butler laid his hand upon the lock, saying in a whisper,-</p> 
               <p>"No, no, Bill,-it won't do. There are too many of 'em; we must beat a retreat as quick as possible."</p> 
               <p>The two then stole carefully back over the summit of the ridge; and, after placing a safe distance between them and the ravenous animals, returned as quickly as possible to the rock.</p> 
               <p>"Well, Captain," said Butler, "it is lucky we have this castle at hand. There are not much less than fifty wolves out yonder. I should think nothing of half a dozen; but the pack is strong and half-starved. I believe they will dog us. The wind blows between us and them, or they would have scanted us before now. We must take to the top of the rock for a while, and see how matters turn out."</p> 
               <p>"Right, James. They are cowards alone, but devils in such gangs as this. You and Bill get the venison up; the d--d rascals sha'n't have that to dine upon. The dog too, take him up with you. Leave your guns by me. I will keep guard till all is ready."</p> 
               <p>The youths then scrambled up the steep rock, sometimes stepping from one knob of its worn surface to another, sometimes swinging themselves up by a friendly bough, and passing from hand to hand the carcass of the deer, and assisting Marquis over the points impracticable to quadruped locomotion.</p> 
               <p>As Butler had anticipated, the wolves soon caught indications of their neighborhood; and scarcely had they reached the elevated terrace with their load, when the foremost animals began to show themselves over the ridge, snuffing the wind and yelping eagerly.</p> 
               <p>"James," said the Captain, "come down to the<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6274-00000088"/> crotch in the birch just over my head, to take the guns from me. I will give them a salute, as they come along the horseback."</p> 
               <p>"Let me come down, Captain; and you climb up while you have time. I can scramble back quicker than you."</p> 
               <p>"No, no,-do as I say, boy. I am not too stiff for that yet. My shots will make them a little cautious about making a rush, I'll warrant it."</p> 
               <p>Dee then, placing the two spare guns behind him, stepped under the cover of the birch bushes, the tops of which also screened Butler's post upon the rock. Some of the beasts had now found the trail, and were noising along the decent towards the party, when a rifle flashed through the boughs, and one of them was sent, whining and yelping, to the rear with a broken leg. Another ball hissed sharply along the ridge, and stretched a second wolf dead upon the ground. But just as the third gun was raised, Butler exclaimed,-"Up with you, Captain. I see the heads of a host of 'em over the hill now. Give me the guns, and jump up."</p> 
               <p>All three presently stood safe upon the platform, where poor Marquis, half belligerent and half terrified, lay crouching at his master's feet, shivering and growling at the crowd of advancing foes. As they came up with their lame comrade, a number began to worry him, with the well-known ferocity of their nature. He still retained, however, vigor enough to requite bite with bite, and snarl by snarl. So he was permitted to withdraw into a thicket to lie down and lick his wounds at his leisure. The gaunt beasts then his turned pell-mell upon the body of their dead comrade, tearing it in pieces and maintaining a running fight over its mangled remnants, till not a morsel but the skull was left upon the ground. A stout battle was held over this last by a dozen of the most powerful; which terminated in its seizure by an enormous gray old patriarch, who bore it off in triumph, followed at a timid distance by two or three, not less hungry, though less strong. These little matters disposed of, one of the leaders of the pack, whose eyes had hitherto been attracted to the surface of the ground by the quest of something to allay his voracious appetite, perceived the little garrison upon the top of the boulder, and announced his discovery by a loud yelp. The scattered prowlers gathered directly from all quarters and formed an irregular semicircle, at a small distance, around its base; expressing their ferocious interest in their coveted prey by a combination of unearthly howlings, that filled the air with its sanguinary discord. That wild boding, infernal cry,-half moan, half savage fury, like the shriek of an angry ghost,-repeated from throat to throat and prolonged in long-drawn yells, might have struck terror into the stoutest heart. But the hunters felt a confidence in their granite stronghold, that converted the appalling sounds into an occasion of indignant contempt rather than of fear.</p> 
               <p>They eyed for a few moments in silence the diabolical exhibition of sanguinary rage, till the stout-hearted and jolly old Captain, seating himself quietly down, said to his companions,-</p> 
               <p>"Here we are,-safe enough, and regularly blockaded by these infernal scamps. What's to be done how, James? I don't care to spend the night on this rock."</p> 
               <p>"O, I think we'll raise the siege shortly," replied Butler, laughing, "provided our ammunition holds out. We can kill or hurt half of them; and the rest<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6274-00000089"/> will eat them up. When their bellies are filled, they won't concern themselves about us any farther."</p> 
               <p>"Very likely,-that's their way. Meanwhile I go for killing as many of the rascals as we can. How many balls have you, Bill?"</p> 
               <p>"About twenty, father."</p> 
               <p>"And you, James?"</p> 
               <p>"Nearly as many, besides some slugs."</p> 
               <p>"That's well. Let me count,-I one-two-three-twelve. I've a baker's dozen in my pocket. We'll do famously. Now, then, load and fire, as fast as you can, but make every shot tell."</p> 
               <p>The Captain's advice was skillfully and energetically followed out. A rapid and sustained fire was poured forth on the devoted animals. The sharp crack of the rifles and the rounder and duller report of William's double-barrel, in rapid succession, carried death or dreadful wounds among them. The close proximity and the ample mark offered by their bodies, to men accustomed to behead a partridge at fifty yards with a single ball, rendered the fire most destructive. The scene soon became one of intense animation. Wreaths of smoke curled up every moment into the air; and the hiss of bullets and slugs was mingled with the yells of the wounded and the savage howls of those still bent on the attack. Now and then some of the older and fiercer wolves,-after standing in a half crouch, with gathered haunches and extended fore-paws, for a few moments, while they howled themselves into a fury-dashed desperately, upon the boulder, in a hopeless attempt at scrambling up its side. But the hard, perpendicular surface afforded them no footing; and they fell backward, after an impotent struggle, lucky if a bullet had not meanwhile put a stop to any further display of activity.</p> 
                
               <p>The ground was soon strewn with a dozen or more dead bodies; while the neighboring bushes were filled with disabled combatants, employed alternately in nursing their hurts and venting their mingled rage and pain in whines and growls. The evident success of the defense raising the spirits of the besieged, the bloodthirsty temper of battle gained the mastery; and it began to be a source of excited pleasure and a trial of skill, with the youngsters of the party.</p> 
               <p>"William," said Butler, "see those two stout fellows standing side by side, under that beech. I will put a ball between the eyes of the right-hand one, and do you take the chap on your own side. Are you ready? Now then-one, two, three."</p> 
               <p>The guns flashed together; and when the smoke cleared away, the wolf fired at by Butler lay motionless upon the ground, a large crimson spot on his forehead attesting the accuracy of the aim. William's ball missed the head of its object, but, grazing under his ear, laid open a ghastly furrow along his back. The spine of the beast was broken, and he rolled over and over upon the ground, filling the air with hideous howls of agony.</p> 
               <p>"Not clean work, William! A smooth-bore is not exactly reliable. But you made a close shot. Give the poor devil another to put him out of his misery."</p> 
               <p>Both recharged their guns, and were just on the point of firing again, when Marquis, excited beyond measure by the commotion of the fight, rushed to the brink of the rock, barking with all his might. But, failing to check his career in time, he lost his balance just upon the edge, and tumbled over among the bushes at its base. During the whole contest he had been gallantly darling to and fro, pouring out his defiance<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6274-00000090"/> of the charges of his foes below; but until now he had wisely regulated his ardor and kept his ground of vantage. With a despairing whine, he slid over the verge, and now lay crouching and trembling in the thicket. Four or five of the wolves observed his fall, and dashed at his covert. But William, holding his gun in his left hand, seized the end of a long bough with his right, and swung himself off the rock. As the limb bent downward with his weight, he let go his hold and dropped upon his feet by the side of his shivering favorite. Quick as thought, his leveled gun laid the foremost assailant upon the ground. But two more were close behind; and others still, at more cautious distance, menaced to support the attack. Before he could fire again, the second rushed in, and made his point at the dog. Fortunately for poor Marquis, a rotten stump stood directly between him and the terrible jaws of his enemy. The enraged animal seized upon it with his teeth, and tore it to pieces with a single effort. But while his mouth was full of the rotten wood, the gallant spaniel, reassured by the timely aid of his young master, fastened his sharp teeth upon his throat, while William buried his knife twice in his shaggy breast, and, with a faint growl, he fell lifeless on his side. Butler had hastily followed William down, and the crack of his rifle sent the third wolf to the right about, with his fore leg shattered and his side torn open. Those who were coming up in the rear, intimidated with his warm reception, halted, and, crouching in a still threatening attitude, contented themselves for the present with a ferocious display of teeth and a savage growling.</p> 
               <p>Butler now stepped boldly to the front and reloaded; and his intrepid demeanor, together with the severe lesson they had received, kept them in check.</p> 
                
               <p>"Carry up the dog, Bill. Lean your gun against the tree, and I will take it with mine. But load first. I can then keep these devils back with three shots for time enough."</p> 
               <p>Loading his gun as rapidly as possible and leaving it at James's side, William took up the dog, and, placing him upon a spur of the rock at the height of his head, sprang himself up into the tree; and the two were again in a minute safe upon the summit. Vexed at the escape of their expected prey, the crouching wolves again threatened a charge. But Butler's cool eye was on them. The moment he saw them rise on their haunches, he laid aside his own rifle, as a sure reserve, and fired both barrels of William's piece in rapid succession. Both balls took effect, and a general retreat followed the discharge. James, taking advantage of the lull, clambered through the tree and up the rock,-William meeting him half way, and relieving him of the supernumerary gun.</p> 
               <p>"Well, Marquis, you didn't get a scratch, after all. Don't try that again, boy, however."</p> 
               <p>Marquis did not seem to need this prudent advice. He looked up into James's face and wagged his tail gently, but lay still for some time, painting and trembling, an occasional whine testifying to the perturbation of mind he had undergone.</p> 
               <p>"You managed that sally bravely, boys," said the Captain. "I stood ready to fire, all the while. But you got along so well that I would not interfere. But what's to be done next? For my part, I am tired of murdering these poor wretches. It begins to look too much like butchery."</p> 
               <p>"I think," said Butler, "that if we lie down flat upon the rock, for some time, out of their sight, that they<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6274-00000091"/> will gorge themselves upon these carcasses and be off. If they won't, I don't see but we must shoot 'em up, or stay here all night."</p> 
               <p>"Let us try your plan first. I think it will work."</p> 
               <p>So saying, the Captain stretched himself at full length, with his head resting on the unskinned deer, and made himself so comfortable that he fell fast asleep. William and Butler lay down side by side, with Marquis between them, keeping up a conversation in whispers. The dog, still trembling with fear and excitement, looked occasionally into their faces with a low whine and licked their hands,-as if to express his reliance on their mutual relations of offence and defense against the brutes, whose fierce quarrelings and ravenous contentions were going on below them.</p> 
               <p>After the lapse of half an hour, Butler, on peeping cautiously over the edge of the rock, found that matters had taken very much the course he had predicted. Many of the dead and some of the most helpless of the wounded animals had been torn to pieces and devoured. Such of those hurt, as were able, had slunk away. The more fortunate survivors of the fray were roaming about, smelling after stray fragments of skin or bones, or squatting in little groups, with the lazy and apathetic air of all brutes after a good meal. Still they hung about the spot, seemingly inclined to take things leisurely.</p> 
               <p>Butler glanced at the sun, and, seeing that the afternoon was more than half gone, turned to advise with his associates as to the expediency of descending and attempting to drive them off, under the persuasion that satiety, as well as the experience of hard knocks to be looked for, might have abated their ferocity. As he was about to speak, a wreath of smoke curled up among the brush-wood hard by, and two rifle-shorts followed each other in rapid succession. One of the beasts dropped dead, and another, with a broken limb, hobbled off howling into the woods. Two men then pushed through the bushes with a shout, which manuvre, accompanied with the fresh destruction from a new and unsuspected enemy, decided the wolves to give up the game. The younger beasts scampered in all quarters, while the veterans withdrew in a sullen trot, occasionally turning for a moment, but resuming their retreat before the ready rifles that were instantly leveled at the loiterers, till not one remained in sight. One of the new-comers was Sam Shirk; the other, a tall and active backwoodsman, well known to all in the neighborhood as Joe Sibley. The besieged party came down from their fortress, and greeted their opportune allies.</p> 
               <p>"Well," said Sibley, "I should judge you'd had a considerable tall wolf-fight, by the looks o' things hereabouts. Sam and I was out, about two miles above, and heard a regular cannonading, as if 'twas Fourth o' July. So, arter a while, we concluded to come and see what was to pay."</p> 
               <p>"I am glad it happened so," replied Butler, "for we stood a good chance of passing the night up yonder."</p> 
               <p>"What made these chaps so darned saacy? They must have been terrible sharp-set to stand two hours before three good shots like you. But they're allers saacier then there's so many on 'em together. Your dog, too, made 'em wus. They'll allers hang on wus, where there's and brute critters they think they can get at than where there's nothin' but men. By Gosh! four, five, six, eight, twelve, sixteen carcasses, besides<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6274-00000092"/> the one I jest shot, and no partickler quantity that they've eat up among themselves. Pretty fair work,-you an't been slow,-that's a fact."</p> 
               <p>While Joe was discussing the case, Sam had set to work to skin such of the animals as had not been devoured by their comrades. Marquis, who was an old acquaintance, kept in close attendance upon him, smelling and nuzzling the warm flesh, as Shirk's a ready knife exposed it to a view, and starting back now and then, with a half-frightened bark, when a sudden roll or motion of a limb recalled to his memory the fearful activity of his living antagonists. This economical proceeding, which occupied his practiced hand but a short time, being finished, he threw down the skins before Captain Dee.</p> 
               <p>"There, Captain, that yellerish one is the hide of the critter Joe killed. The rest is your'n, unless you'll give me one; for I want a wolf-skin bad. I've been a tryin' to shoot one all day."</p> 
               <p>"You may have 'em all, Sam, unless the boys here want them."</p> 
               <p>Butler and William waved their claims, and Sam joyfully bundled up the best of them, and, tying them round with a cord, placed them over his shoulder, on the end of his rifle. Two or three long tails, dangling down his back, gave to his figure an odd and comical appearance; and Marquis could not restrain himself from jumping up, every five minutes, to worry at his supernumerary caudal appendages. Joe Sibley threw the saddle and haunches of William's deer over his broad shoulders; and all started to leave the spot.</p> 
               <p>"Well, where are we bound, James?" said the Captain. "We can't very well get home to night. It's sunset already."</p> 
                
               <p>"No, no, come along to my house. 'Tan't more than three mile. We can give ye all sumthin' to eat; and, if ye can't do no better, some of ye, it'll be as good to sleep on the hay, as out door."</p> 
               <p>Joe's invitation was accepted with as little ceremony as it was given. The sun had set, and dimness had gradually crept in among the tall trees of the dense forest, when a patch of brighter atmosphere gradually opened upon them, hovering over a cleared field surrounded by a rough hedge of felled trees and bushes, and stretching out widely in front of them. Passing through a gap, the proprietor led the way towards a bright light, twinkling out upon the gray evening and the black shadow of the forest, like a star through a heavy cloud. The light shone through a little square window of Sibley's log-house; and the travellers were soon enjoying the welcome warmth of the glowing fire that was roaring up the rough stone chimney.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head> 
               <p>JOE SIBLEY'S dwelling was of the construction ordinarily found upon the frontiers of civilization. Its walls consisted of logs, laid up in successive tiers and notched into each other at the intersection of the corners. The interstices being closely packed with moss and clay, made a snug habitation, that defied effectually even the keen cold of winter. Two square openings in the sides of each of the two rooms, into which the interior was divided, were filled by sashes of four panes of glass each. The roof was composed of sheets of hemlock bark, laid carefully and closely over the rafters; and from its centre peeped forth a chimney, built of small sticks laid up in "Harry house" fashion, and plastered within and without with clay. The base of this structure stood before the eye as one entered, but constructed of flat stones neatly laid up; and the hearths were of the same material. Floors, partitions and shelves, of rough boards indifferently well put together, completed the inside finish; while a ladder, that ran up alongside the chimney through the floor overhead, served as staircase to the sleeping apartments in the roof. The door revolved on hinges, and closed with a latch of hard wood; the latter being of that primitive construction described to little Red Riding-hood,-"If you pull at the bobbin, the latch will fly up." The hands of the owner were aided by no mechanical appliances but the saw, the axe, the auger, and a jackknife in the rising of the dwelling; and so ingeniously simple were the contrivances resorted to for accomplishing the usual functions of its various parts, that a very trifling sum would cover the cost of all the "boughten" materials employed. Indeed, except the nails used in the interior and the few panes of glass in the sashes, there were no traces of the multiform, convenient and labor-saving productions of the workshop or manufactory. Bolts, locks, and springs there were none; and, as we had said, the latches and hinges grew in the forest. Paint, paper, and even plastering were luxuries easily dispensed with. But here and there the coarse partition was concealed by a bill of huge dimensions, displaying astounding portraits of the animals contained in the cages of a travelling menagerie. Here the elephant, lion, and rhinoceros, with a host of lesser wonders, attended by Dandy Jack and his pony, exhibited their uncouth figures, to instruct and amuse the young dwellers in the woods. Ever and anon, the shingles or sheets of birch-bark that were patched upon the logs, shone out in the splendor of gamboge and vermilion, liberally spread upon the surface of a print of Washington or Marlborough, or some ideal female beauty, that, by some odd chance, had found their way from the print-shops of London or Paris into the wilderness. A cupboard and row of shelves, containing a small assortment of the usual table-ware, sufficed for that department of the household arrangements. A small looking-glass against the wall lent its services 'to the females of the family, and enabled the rougher sex to reduce their chins, each Sunday morning, to the condition prescribed by modern taste. Here and there<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6274-00000094"/> hung upon a nail various small matters of family or personal use or fancy. A birchen basket, shaped like a cartridge-box, hanging by its open lid, would be found, on inspection, to contain a comb, a head-brush, a pin-cushion, and a pair of scissors, perchance a razor and its strop. Another similar box, also in convenient proximity to the mirror, would furnish forth, on festive occasions or upon the Sabbath, sundry strings of beads, a somewhat faded feather, or a bunch of artificial flowers. Two or three chests, containing apparel or tools, were ranged on the sides of the rooms, the tops of which officiated as "chaises longues," while their capacious interiors served to hold a goodly store of useful articles in safety.</p> 
               <p>In one corner, a huge, square chair stood against the wall, that seemed made for the accommodation of some Patagonian. But the ample surface, which, hinged upon the arms, rose up behind, told the curious inquirer that three times a day it was let down upon those rectangular arms, to spread the family repast. In fact, it was the rude and humble prototype of that well-known piece of furniture, which,-the chair portion refined away and the material changed,-occupied the corners of our grandmothers' parlors in all the gloss and sombre dignity of mahogany. Now, retreating before modern innovation, they are fallen from parlor and drawing-room to the humbler apartments, where their unobtrusive and room-economizing usefulness is still appreciated.</p> 
               <p>Alas for the fast-vanishing simplicity of our fathers! We are fallen off sadly from the republican plainness of the days of cocked hats, knee-breeches, and venerable pig-tails. Profusion and extravagance are making advances among us beyond the line of prudence and the true limits of our social circumstances. And yet, ye cynics of economy, it may not be well altogether to weigh the tastes and preferences that best distinguish us from the brutes, too severely against mere dollars and cents. It would not be well that we should not know, or should not care for, the difference between the tub of Diogenes and the Tusculan villa of Cicero. Shall we, like the hog, provided we get our dinner, be indifferent as to what through holds it? Who would not, provided he could afford it,-and this proviso is, we confess, more important than many seem to think it,-spend a superfluous hundred, to dine from a table that Praxiteles might have designed or Alcibides feasted at? The gentle pleasures of the eye, as it drinks in grace and beauty at every glance, are worth time and money and reverence too. It is better, immeasurably better, to see your young wife bending over her sleeping treasure, not esconced in a candle box on rockers, but nestled, like Cupid, in a lotus-leaf so nicely balanced that Psyche's breath might give it motion.</p> 
               <p>We should not forget that the virtues of prudence and economy,-for that they are virtues, and of primary importance too, many a penniless prodigal can substantiate by a negative pregnant,-are not ends, but means. They are not our only desirable bosom-friends and fireside cronies, because they are faithful drudges in the counting-house and invaluable prompters upon 'change. The wreath of Taste and Genius adds beauty to the column, whose strength it does not impair so long as it is the clustering garland of the trained flower. It is noxious when, like the mislead and the ivy, it finds its support in the bosom of incipient decay. Deep and generous is the philosophy of the Frenchman,-"The love of the beautiful is the virtue of the intellect."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head> 
               <p>"I'VE brought some folks to stop over night, Liddy," said Joe Sibley to his wife, while the party were laying aside their guns and other incumbrances.</p> 
               <p>"So I see-'tan't often you don't," replied his spouse, apparently a little pettish at the prospect of additional trouble to herself, involved in the fact announced.</p> 
               <p>No inhospitable reluctance, however, was implied in the good woman's speech. The guests, who well knew the character both of host and hostess, only smiled at the peevish sally, while they disposed themselves comfortably about the room. Mrs. Sibley, after a brief salutation to all, applied herself without another word to her appropriate duties,-put a huge supply of potatoes into the big iron pot, sliced up a piece of fat salted pork into the frying pan, and while the potatoes danced and bubbled, and the pork sputtered and curled over the fire, went to her bread-pan, and commenced moulding the little biscuits to be baked in the tin baker before the bright blaze. Meanwhile her eldest daughter, who probably had, at the age of twelve, more practical skill in housewifery than most city dames ever attain, spread the table and set the best tea-pot on the hearth, in readiness to receive its fragrant infusion.</p> 
               <p>It was not altogether without reason that the mistress tress of the house had commented upon her husband's hospitality. In the early settlements of all countries, as among barbarous peoples, hospitality is, from the very necessity of the case, a prominent virtue. All grant without hesitation, and almost without a thought of conferring favor, what all must, at times, be compelled to ask, to secure comfort, or even not uncommonly to preserve existence. But the universal and matter-of-course free quarters of rude and straggling communities were extended to an unusual compass with Sibley. In the first place, he was a frank, cordial, and warm-hearted man by nature, careless and improvident withal in his temperament. Shrewd, energetic, and full of expedients, he always managed, somehow or other, to supply his immediate wants, and seldom troubled himself about economizing resources on hand. Whatever there might be in the flour-barrel, molasses key, or box of tea and sugar,-whether more or less,-was at the service of any who wanted; and, although patient and steady industry was by no means his forte, the master of the house was seldom at a loss for means of renewing the stock. Joe was one of the wandering and restless men so common in the backwoods. He spent nine tenths of his time in hunting or in various, speculative excursions about the neighborhood.</p> 
               <p>Twenty miles of a rough and tangled horse-path, bristling with stumps and stones and interspersed with sloughs, crossed by bridgeless brooks and swamps, lay between his house and the village at the falls near the river's mouth. Yet seldom did a week pass over his head without a visit to Merrifield. The toilsome journey was an insignificant trifle to his robust and active limbs; and his busy mind was always provided<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6274-00000096"/> with some excuse, more or less tangible, for the expedition. Nor did Merrifield bound the sphere of his operations. In all the little hamlets of the neighboring regions, everybody knew Joe Sibley; and everybody liked him for his careless good nature, and because he was always ready to enter into any new scheme or to make a trade. No man, in all those parts, bought, sold, or swapped horses, cattle, logs, or lesser articles of commerce, half so often as Joe. He generally made a good bargain for himself; yet he was honest and fair in his dealings. We must, however, make one exception to his morality. He was not always up to his word. Good-natured and lazy, he never liked to say No,-but was apt to promise anything that was asked, and perform his promise or not, as might prove convenient. Always disposed to traffic out of all proportion to his capital, he was far from prompt, sometimes, in his payments. But he always contrived, in the long run, to "turn something or other," as he phrased it, so as to meet his obligations. He seldom had a cent of money; but he could scarcely meet a man with whom he had not some running account or unfinished transaction, out of which he could make resources for his immediate purposes. In fact, Joe's various operations, big and little, constituted no small part of the circulating medium of the trade of the valley. Not implicitly reliable, but pretty sure to come out right side up, sooner or later, his credit was not first-rate, yet everybody was willing to risk a trade with him; and Joe always wanted to buy or do something, that made a vent for almost any commodity and an opportunity for every possible arrangement. He was the very impersonation of barter, and the channel through which an endless series of exchanges and petty contracts found their completion. His business habits were of so desultory a stamp, and his processes so multiform and loose, that it would have been a miracle, with anybody else, that half of them should be brought to any conclusion. Yet, though he could not write, beyond signing his name, nor read manuscript with any facility, he managed, by an inexhaustible activity and with the help of a tenacious memory, strengthened by perpetual exercise, to keep along his numberless matters and preserve the run of his accounts with his neighbors. He drove over the rude roads-when not on horseback or on foot-in some old wagon that threatened continually instant dissolution of its component parts, and every day or two with a new horse, and every week or two, a new, old harness. His locomotive arrangements were, like his jangling and disorderly system of business, appalling and useless to anybody else, but just suited to him. He "worried along"-to use his own language-with both of them, after his own peculiar fashion. If his carriage broke down or his business got cramped occasionally, it only served to call out some extra ingenuity or queer contrivance to meet the temporary emergency. Thus he always devised means, not only "to make one hand wash t'other," in the main, but to keep at his command a far greater variety and extent of resources than his more methodical neighbors. One result of his habits and character was, that all the loose odds and ends of the vicinity, animate or inanimate, were generally hanging about him. Every shiftless, houseless vagabond came, as a last resource, to Sibley. His good nature housed and fed them, in their hour of want; while his shrewdness got out of them remuneration by setting them about the jobs<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6274-00000097"/> which he lacked leisure or industry to attend to himself. Thus there were generally two or three stragglers hanging around his premises, who, for their board and lodging, or such hap-hazard compensation as was convenient for him to make, took care of his homestead, as far as it was cared for at all, and left him at liberty to hunt, trade, or loaf about at pleasure. The shiftlessness of these dependents was more in harmony with his modes of arrangement, or rather his want of arrangement, than conducive to the comfort and regularity of his household. His wife, who was a tidy and thrifty woman, often looked askance at the tatterdemalion crew with which her husband surrounded their home. But, conscious that remedy there was none, she never made any more serious remonstrances than that with which she had greeted his return at this time; and the fretfulness of the remark was doubtless induced more by general considerations than any want of welcome for her present guests. With quiet and practiced celerity,-for she was used to such demands upon her diligence, at all hours and seasons,-she prepared a neat, but simple repast. When all was in order, she lighted a dipped tallow candle, which she placed upon the table, and announced that "tea was ready."</p> 
               <p>The meal was dispatched with the appetite which exercise in the open air alone can afford. The table was drawn back upon one side, where the good housewife busied herself in clearing up. The candle was blown out; for such artificial light was here used only for special occasions,-the ruddy blaze from the broad hearth affording abundant illumination for the ordinary occupations of the evening. Captain Dee, Sibley, and Shirk produced their pipes and tobacco; and conversation and rest became the amusements of the hour.</p> 
                
               <p>"Well, Captain," said their host, "your scrape with the wolves out yonder puts me in mind of a time I once had myself with a thunderin' bear, down here on the meadows."</p> 
               <p>"Let's have the story, Joe, by all means."</p> 
               <p>"Well, ye see I started one day afoot to go down to the village; and jest over Great Falls' branch down in that 'ere meadow to the right of the track, I see a burstin' great bear. I hadn't no gun with me, but I thought I might have some fun; so I crept down among the bushes and worked along till I got close on to him; and then I jumped out and hollered. I expected to skeer him, of course; for, you know, a bear 'll most always run. But, instid o' that, the crittur faced round, and begun to show fight, and growled like destruction. Just then, too, I see two cubs skulking into the bushes; and then I knowed right well 'twas an old she one; and that I'd got a customer. I felt in my pockets for my jack-knife, but it warn't there. I couldn't see a stick nowhere. There wasn't nothin' round but a parcel of darned alder bushes. So I begun to think I'd been a pretty considerable fool to get into sech a fix. But she didn't give me much time to think about it at all; for she came right at me and ris up on her hind legs for a hug. But, says I to myself, that won't do, marm,-it's too friendly by a d--d sight. So, ye see, as I hadn't nothin' to fight with, I had to run. I backed out through the bushes, till I was lucky enough to come to a small birch that run up about ten foot, without a limb. When I got it jest to my back, she was follerin' close onto me. I kept my face to her all along; and when I got to the tree, I off with my cap and threw it right at her eyes. She ris up agin, straight away; and as soon as I saw<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6274-00000098"/> her up on eend, I turned round and jumped for the branches. I jest got where I could catch hold and swing myself up, when down she came, and at the tree, like possessed. She was as mad as the devil to see me out o' reach, and she sot out to come arter me and grappled and birch, but it was so small she couldn't grip it. All she could do was to stick her claws into the bark and histe up on her hind legs. Just as soon as she drew up to climb, her claws would give out, and down she'd go. It wan't very comfortable, through, to sit there within less than a foot of her ugly muzzle, you may depend. Now, you see, I had my dog with me,-a little bit of a feller, not half so big as your Marquis there. The little chap was good stuff, though; and he'd been havin' a time among the cubs, while the old one and I was dodgin' round. Jest as soon as he see I was tree'd, and the tarnal did beast was tryin' to get at me, he pitched into her like smoke, and set his teeth in her haunches right smart; for he was a terrible sharp-bitten feller. He warn't big enough to do her no harm, to speak of; but I guess he made her smart some, for she'd tumble down quicker'n lightnin', and arter him. Away they'd go,-dog, bear, and cubs,-through the grass and bushes, gruntin', growlin' and barkin', till the old devil would find out she couldn't catch him; and then she'd come back to look arter me. Spring laid off a piece and kept still then, till she'd get savage again and try to git up the tree. But jest as fast as she started up, he let in and she wouldn't be fairly on eend before he'd have her by the tail. So we kept it up above half an hour; and I begun to think the old crittur would a 'kept me there all day. But I happened to think that, if I spent spring off, she might get tired and give it up. So I hollered at him, and he poked off among the brush, out o' sight. In about a quarter of an hour more, the old sarpent made up her mind she couldn't come it; and, arter givin' me a handsome growl or two, by way of sayin' 'good-mornin',' she started and looked up her cubs and cleared out. Arter she was out o' sight, I got down, and Spring and I went along. I made up my mind that mornin' I'd never play with them critturs any more,-specially when I hadn't got no gun."</p> 
               <p>"You were worse off than we were with the wolves to-day, Joe," said Butler, after the peals of laughter that followed Sibley's story had subsided.</p> 
               <p>"Wasn't I? If I'd had a gun, I wouldn't have vallied her at all. But, as it was, I wished she was furder. I hardly ever knowed a bear, though, to tackle anybody. Jem Succobash, the Indian, was out jest above here one day, and a comin' along home towards night, when a great old bear jumped out of a bush on him, and tore his shoulder awful bad. It was jest about dusk, and I suppose Jem was goin' along tired and keerless, or he'd seen him sooner. A lot of us went out arter him next day, and killed him. He had a great cut in his breast, where Jem knifed him; but he made a stout fight, and killed one of our dogs, for all that. I got six or seven gallons of oil out of him."</p> 
               <p>"Do the wolves trouble you much out here, Joe?"</p> 
               <p>"Not much. They make a tarnal howlin; sometimes o' nights, round the house. I can't keep sheep, for 'em. I tired it a spell, but it wan't no use. They got more mutton than I did. They'll dog a feller that's out alone arter dark, sometimes; but they never meddled with me in the day-time."</p> 
               <p>The evening was worn away in the discussion of<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6274-00000099"/> these and similar topics, and a general stir preluded preparations for sleep. Mrs. Sibley announced that she had made such arrangements as she could, in the other room of the house, for Captain Dee, William, and Butler. Sam Shirk made himself a bed, which he considered luxurious, out of his wolf-skins; and silence and slumber soon pervaded the dwelling.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head> 
               <p>THE morning dawned as clear and brilliant as the preceding; and the household of Sibley were afoot with the first peep of day. The sun had not yet risen when Dee, accompanied by James and William, with a clean towel upon his arm, took his way to a fine, clear spring that bubbled up in the field hard by the house, to make their simple toilet. A copious ablution in the pure, cold water sufficed for all purposes of health and comfort. Sibley's farm was upon the top of one of those hard-wood ridges, so commonly chosen by the early settlers. As they stood bareheaded in the fresh morning, their eyes were irresistibly attracted by the magnificent landscape before them; although it was perfectly familiar to them all.</p> 
               <p>Their position was high enough to command a large extent of country in all directions. In the early light, a dim, grayish-green tint, with heavy shadows of the deepest gloom, still hung over the wooded hollows. The eastern sides of the long swells were defined in the full dark green of the northern forests; while the summits of the hills and mountains and the prominent tops of lofty trees glowed with the distinctest hues of day, and sparkled with the earliest rays of the sun, yet invisible through the dense growth that skirted the horizon. Damp, black shadows slumbered on the western sides of the hills; the light dews were floating up, in<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6274-00000100"/> slender threads, from the valleys; and the sharp-cut belt of woods around the limits of the clearing rose like a girdling wall about them, with night and darkness hanging in its leafy recesses on the one side, while the other half of the circuit was lighting up with momentarily increasing day. Behind them, the high ridge of Pleasant Mountain still buried in shadow the long slopes that stretched up to its summit; while the bald ledge, which formed its sterile crown, glimmered in the upward-slanting sunlight, and each dwarfed birch and stunted spruce was penciled clearly against the sky. On their left, the gradually descending land-fall sloped away southward, till, beyond the limit of distinct vision, the bosom of the ocean reflected the rays of the sun just streaming over its surface, in a blaze of gold. In front of them, a series of rugged and lofty hills, girdled each with a distinct line, where the evergreen trees yielded up the bleak summits to their tougher brethren of the hard-wood tribes, rose at various distances, cutting off in irregular succession the vistas across the lower grounds, till they formed a continuous blue barrier along the valley of the broad Penobscot. On the right, opened the narrow pathway of the swift Narraguagus; the twin summits of Humpback Mountain, looming up lonely sentinels on its farther verge, about two miles from where they stood, while the gradually sloping descents that trended northward from its lofty pinnacles and from the somewhat lower brow of Pleasant Mountain, guarded a long opening into the heart of the wilderness; until the blue distance finally melted into the dim outlines of Katahdin on the one side, and the Schoodic highlands on the other.</p> 
               <p>"By the Heaven that made us and all this glorious world, what a prospect for a man's eye to open upon every morning!" burst forth Dee.</p> 
                
               <p>"Yes, indeed, it is a scene to stir one's inmost soul, Captain. Yet I am afraid it would lose much of its power over us, if we saw it everyday. Our friend Joe there never looks at it, but to pick out the best glades of timber or guess at the most promising hunting-grounds. This very minute he is thinking of nothing but his breakfast, I'll bet my rifle to a popgun."</p> 
               <p>"I dare to say. But isn't it strange, James, that a man can live among such scenery, and never get an idea or experience a feeling that might not spring up as well in a potato-field?"</p> 
               <p>"It is incomprehensible, yet I believe that the greater portion of the world, even of its educated classes, pay very little attention to the wonders of Nature, either in the magnificence of its extent or the beauties of its detail. They go through life with their hearts shut to all these things, and know hardly more what is about them than a blind man."</p> 
               <p>"True enough. I believe God means that a considerable portion of our happiness should consist in the admiration and enjoyment of the outward world. Else, why is it so grand, so beautiful, and so endlessly various to boot? It makes me downright angry to find a man never thinking of the glorious sky, except to know whether it is hot or cold, or if he wants to take his umbrella out with him or not. Then, if you do find one who calls himself a lover of Nature, he often does nothing but hunt up same d--d ugly bug to skewer into a box with a pin. He don't care a copper for the most beautiful flower he sees, if anybody has ever seen it before him. If it is something new, and he can make up a name for it, and immortalize his own in a dandelion Smithii, or a skunk-cabbage, Browniensis, he's in raptures."</p> 
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6274-00000101"/> 
               <p>"You are severe upon the scientific men, Captain,' said Butler, laughing.</p> 
               <p>"Well, all those things may be right enough, but I thank God I an't scientific. I don't want to see everything through a microscope, or enjoy myself by learned systems. These things must be done by somebody, I suppose. But to my fancy, it's disgusting and contemptible to measure this splendid creation by foot-rules, or weigh it in scales."</p> 
               <p>"Father," interrupted William, "Mrs. Sibley wants us in to breakfast. I see the towel hung out at the window."</p> 
               <p>"Well, we'll go in then, Bill. But I could spend an hour here to my perfect satisfaction."</p> 
               <p>They then returned to the house. William Dee had been vainly endeavoring to coax his curly locks into order with his fingers. But after many attempts, he found, on inspection in the bit of broken looking glass fastened to the wall, that his success had been very indifferent. So he decided, after some hesitation, to inquire what the resources of the house could supply to meet the difficulty. The little barefooted damsel ransacked in vain a sort of flat birchen basket that hung beneath another bit of mirror. Her mother, ascertaining the object of the search, thus accounted for the absence of the article:-</p> 
               <p>"La! Mr. William, I'm dreadful sorry; but our comb an't to home. I lent it to Miss Henchfield yesterday."</p> 
               <p>William made no reply but a smiling nod; and thinking, on the whole, that such a peripatetic utensil might as well be done without, sat down, to his breakfast as he was.</p> 
               <p>During the meal, Sibley proposed an excursion into the woods for the day.</p> 
                
               <p>"You an't had much of a chance yet; you'd better stop over a spell. I set a bear-trap yesterday for an old feller that's been plaguin' me round the barn lately; and I think it's full likely he's catched by this time."</p> 
               <p>"What do you, say James?" said Dee. "William and I have nobody to think of but ourselves. I don't I believe your mother will be troubled at our stay. She knows that a man can't tell just when he'll get back, when he's once in the woods."</p> 
               <p>"No, I don't think mother 'll fret. I should like to try luck a little further. I've shot nothing yet, but those ragamuffin wolves."</p> 
               <p>"Then we'll go with Joe and Sam. You'll vote that way, I know, William. Where's your trap, Joe?"</p> 
               <p>"Jest under old Humpback. I baited it jest as nice as I knew how. I guess the old feller's found it out by this time. If he's meddled with it, he's catched, I'll bet a dollar."</p> 
               <p>The party consequently took their guns and proceeded through the clearing, down the western slope of the ridge, towards the river. Half a mile of walking brought them to the little valley through which ran the stream, here about forty or fifty yards wide. The decent of the water, in this hilly region, was rapid and continuous, and the river in this dry season was easily fordable, being seldom more than a foot in depth; while all the stones, of any considerable size, projected above or very near the surface. Picking their way across its bed, they ascended the rounded bank on the farther side, and entered the forest.</p> 
               <p>"Now let's go along quiet," said Joe. "If the old feller an't in the trap, we may come across him in the woods."</p> 
               <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6274-00000102"/> 
               <p>The breeze had not yet risen; and not a sound was to be heard, except now and then a wood-mouse or squirrel scampering away over the leaves, or a wood-packer hammering at a hollow tree. It was necessary to move with extreme caution and slowly, that some unlucky step might not betray their approach, by the rustling of a bush or the rattling of a fallen branch. After a mile or more of this silent progress, Joe Sibley, who led the way, turned and said in a low voice,-</p> 
               <p>"The trap's jest over this hill, right down in the holler. If we creep up behind that bunch of fir bushes, we can see it."</p> 
               <p>Accordingly the party moved up the side of a little rounded hillock, taking care, as they approached the summit, to keep themselves behind the thicket. Having all reached the spot, they sat down upon the ground; while Joe carefully peered round to find a loop-hole through which he could see beyond their leafy screen. After a moment's observation, he whispered,-</p> 
               <p>"He's there, but I can't make out yet what kind of fix he's in. I calculated it to break his back for him; but he's alive, for I see him move. Come here, Butler, and see what you make of it."</p> 
               <p>James and Sibley now contrived, both of them, to get a peep through the tops of the young evergreens; Shirk also wriggled himself into the convert, till he could obtain a glimpse through the stiff, interlaced boughs. Their joint reconnoitring soon ascertained the exact position of things.</p> 
               <p>Just where the slope of the hill met the edges of a cedar swamp, three large white-pine trees grew close together, forming an irregular triangle; so that some stout branches, piled up and interwined between them, made a hollow cell of three or four feet across, the two foremost trees forming the entrance posts. In front of these, a large log was laid upon the ground transversely; and above it another heavy stick was suspended at one end in the air, by the contrivance called by hunters, from its shape, a figure four. Sibley had then chopped several trees into lengths of about ten feet, and laid them up, by means of lateral props, into walls upon each side of the trap, disposed in the front of the recess, and covered the top partially; so that the bait upon the projecting tongue of the trap could be approached only from the front of the barricade. A pull upon the bait was calculated to disturb the support of the sliding log, so as to bring it down upon the neck of the intermeddler. It appeared that Bruin had entered the trap and attacked the bait. But, by some chance, the falling log had failed to break his neck, and he had even extricated his head; but one fore-paw was firmly jammed between the logs, beyond his power to extricate it. The powerful brute had thrown down one side of the pen, and dislodged the sticks that covered it, in his struggles to free himself. He was now seen laying down on the ground, from which he half rose up, every few minutes, endeavoring to pull out its imprisoned foot, and growling savagely with pain and impatience.</p> 
               <p>"He's a master big one," whispered Sibley; "if he should get clear, he'd give us a time. He'll try his best when he sees us. I'll give him a shot before we show ourselves. Keep your dog still, William. That critter 'll use him up with one clip, if he meddles with him."</p> 
               <p>Marquis, having learned prudence perhaps in his rencounter with the wolves, lay down quietly, at his master's command. But the chafing of his excited<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6274-00000103"/> spirit was vented by a subdued whine as he looked up submissive to the uplifted finger. Whether it were the dog's whine, or the click of Sibley's rifle, as he cocked and aimed it, the bear now evidently suspected the neighborhood of enemies. Just as Joe aimed behind his ear, he jerked himself upward in a renewed attempt at escape. The ball, grazing some inches below the vulnerable spot where it was meant to strike, cut a flesh-wound in his shoulder and throat, which served to irritate much more than to disable him. He how made gigantic efforts to free himself, wallowing and twisting from side to side, while the pain inflicted by his own motions upon the confined limb made him groan and growl furiously. His tongue hung out from his mouth with his agony and exhaustion, while his gnashing teeth and rolling eyes proclaimed his rage and terror most fearfully. His exertions grew to be so violent, that Sibley, throwing aside all idea of further concealment, shouted aloud, "Let him have it, Butler, right behind his ear, if you can."</p> 
               <p>Butler instantly fired; but such were the fierce contortions and struggles of the desperate animal, that he was hardly more successful. The bear dropped his head and rounded up his back as the gun flashed, and the ball lodging against his ribs, instead of reaching the more vital part, only added afresh to his rags and terror. He seized the log that lay across his foot furiously with his teeth, and succeeded in raising it, for an instant, so that a simultaneous jerk effected the release of his paw, though broken at the ankle and sorely bruised. After licking once or twice his mangled limb, he turned his head over his shoulder, to gaze a moment at his assailants, who had now risen into full view from behind the bushes. Then he backed out of the half-ruined trap with a loud growl, and dashed up the hill at them, with all the speed his disabled state allowed.</p> 
               <p>"Take behind the trees!" shouted Joe, and at his suggestion, each stepped, for cover, to the nearest trunk. But, by this time, the furious beast had reached the brow of the hillock and pushed through the low girdle of fir trees. All had found shelter when he appeared among them, except Captain Dee, who, less active than his younger companions, unfortunately caught his foot, and fell prostrate, directly in the path of the animals, and not a rod from him. His danger was imminent. The enormous brute rushed, with glaring eyes and gnashing teeth, directly upon him. But Marquis saw him fall, and sprang, with one ringing bark and a volley of growls, to his head, where he stood, with tail erect and bristling back, in defense of his helpless patron. Regardless of such puny opposition, the bear never checked his career for a moment, but raised his paw to sweep his little antagonist from before him. The gallant dog's fate would have been sealed in an instant, but this manure compelled Bruin to throw his weight upon the wounded limb, which, failing under him, brought him to his knees. Butler and William Dee rushed to the rescue, and planted themselves by Marquis's side, who now sprang upon the enemy, and seized him by the ear. James's rifle had been discharged, and William was too agitated to fire, but both stood with their guns raised for a blow. The brute rose again to his feet, and shook off the dog like a fly, jerking him several yards from him. But meanwhile Sam Shirk fired his ball into his nearest flank, and Joe Sibley advanced with leveled gun upon the other side. The Captain scrambled up and escaped<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6274-00000104"/> from his dangerous situation; while his dreadful assailant, confused by the attack from so many quarters, turned partially upon the last comer, and finally raised himself upon his hind legs, after the fashion of his kind, to grapple with the first who should come within his reach. But Joe's sharp eye was ranging along his rifle, in a straight line with the opening of the ear turned towards him by the last evolution. The flame blazed from the muzzle almost into the eyes of the victim, and the ball crashed into his brain. Falling heavily to the ground, he died without a sound or a motion. Marquis laid down about a yard from his muzzle, as if fearful that the terrible foe might yet rouse again to the assault; nor did he cease to growl till Sibley and Shirk laid their hands on the unresisting carcass. He then ventured up to smell and examine more critically his dreaded opponent.</p> 
               <p>"An't he a buster?" cried Shirk. "Shall I skin him, Joe?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly; his hair is in excellent order, and his hide has but three bullet-hopes in it. We might have riddled him like a sieve, though, if we hadn't touched him in the right place. I've known an old chap like him carry off more than twenty balls. They're tough as a pine knot."</p> 
               <p>"He will weigh seven or eight hundred, won't he?" said Dee. "I have Heaven and Marquis to thank, that he didn't finish me. Come here, boy,-you're true as steel, an't you?"</p> 
               <p>Marquis expressed his satisfaction at results by all canine demonstrations of joy, while William stood by, silent, but with his eyes filled with tears.</p> 
               <p>"Pooh, Bill,-mustn't be a baby. Nobody can say you didn't do a man's duty just now, anyhow. God be thanked! my son,-all's right yet."</p> 
                
               <p>Sam was meanwhile proceeding rapidly with his job of "taking off the bear's jacket," as he quaintly termed it, while the rest stood by, looking with interest at its huge and sinewy frame.</p> 
               <p>"Yes,-eight hundred, at least, he weighs," said Butler.</p> 
               <p>"Full better than that," added Sibley. "He's fat as a hog. I will fetch the horse out and take the carcass in. I think a bear-steak's prime, myself. Besides, he'll make oil enough for me to burn all winter."</p> 
               <p>"All o' that, I'll guarantee," responded Shirk. "I hain't skun a fatter one this ten year. Here, Marquis, take this chunk o' meat for your luncheon. Ye're prime stuff,-what there is of ye, old feller. I expected this chap would have laid you out straight enough; and so he would, if it hadn't been for this broken flipper. Now I think we'd better turn to and take a smoke."</p> 
               <p>Sam's proposition suited the mood of the party well, after their excitement and fight. Captain Dee produced his tobacco-pouch and pipe, and, looking at Marquis as he wagged his tail over his plentiful repast, said to his son, whose eyes had again filled with tears at Sam's allusion to the narrow escape of his father: "You and I will remember Marquis's good service, and not forget what is due in a higher quarter, either. I didn't admire that old devil's physiognomy, so near to mine, Joe. Those gentry are decidedly better looking, farther off."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I thought so, when I sot in the tree looking at that old she-one I told you of last night, Captain."</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6274-00000105"/> 
               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head> 
               <p>AFTER half an hour spent in quiet chat, Sibley rose to go for his horse.</p> 
               <p>"Butler, you ha'n't shot nary deer yet. Now, d'ye see, if you'll jest go down to the little pond yonder, I'll bet you'll get a chance. It's growin' warm, and they'll be wadin' into the water about noon. Sam, suppose you finish dressing that bear? I'll be back in an hour at furderest; and you may put his hide along o' your wolf-skins, if you'll stay and keep the wolves off till I come. The rest on 'em will have time to kill a deer too; and then we'll all go back and get some dinner."</p> 
               <p>This plan suited all parties. Sam resumed his butchering operations,-with Marquis, whom his young master had bidden to stay behind also, extended at length upon the ground, watching his proceedings. The deer-stalkers were fearful that his over-eager zeal might spoil their sport at the pond. The Dees and Butler walked quietly down through the woods, till the broader glimpse of sky and fuller light warned them that they were on the borders of the little lake. They then crept along with extreme caution, till they halted at last behind a thick clump of young cedars on its margin. Here all three seated themselves, where they could watch the shores through the openings.</p> 
                
               <p>The sunshine glittered upon the placid bosom of the water, so thoroughly protected from the light breeze by the girdle of tall woods and the hills that encircled it, that not a ripple broke its bright mirror. The clear autumnal sky and the light, fleecy clouds that floated above were reflected with glowing accuracy upon its surface. The deep shadows of the southern shores and the broken lights of the opposite banks, where the sunlight penetrated, here and there, the dark, eternal gloom of the forest with its golden gleams, composed a picture of matchless splendor and yet magic softness. Alders and white cedars fringed the pebbled shore, and cast cool, green shadows over the sparkling waters. Tall pines and spruces crowned the more elevated banks; and clumps of fires relieved, at intervals, the foreground of brown trunks, with their deep green foliage. As the ground behind rose in swelling ridges, gradually growing into hills, the lighter and more graceful forms of hard-wood trees interwove themselves with the pillared grandeur of the pines, till all individuality was lost in an impervious ocean of verdure, repeating high up in air the undulating outlines of the ground with its canopy of leaves,-as unbroken and continuous apparently as the earth itself.</p> 
               <p>Upon the right and somewhat in advance of the spot where the party lay in ambush, a deep cove circled into the woods; into the head of which, a little brook discharged the waters that it gathered along the skirts of the mountain and the contiguous hills. A colony of beavers had dammed the mouth of the cove, taught by their curious instinct to form a safe and commodious basin for the erection of their island fortresses. But the sagacious and timid animals had retired-as is their wont-from the first intrusion of man for some<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6274-00000106"/> more distant spot, yet free from disturbance and danger. The brook had gradually undermined the centre of the structure thus left to the mercy of the elements by its little architects; and its disjointed wall, though still traceable here and there across the mouth of the inlet, no longer delayed the waters from their natural level. The subsidence of the artificial inundation laid bare again the little intervals which the earthy deposits of the stream for ages had been forming about its mouth; and they were already covered with a growth of alders and young cedars, interspersed, now and then, with an elm raising gracefully its feathery head among the heavier and sharper outlines of the evergreens. The wings of the beaver-dam still bordered the outer edges of the flats on either side, with a little mound, like the wasted parapet of some aboriginal entrenchment. The shores of the lake beyond swept away in easy curves, but jutting out occasionally into sharp points, where some knoll, clad with tall pines, threw its rounded base out into the water; or where a line of boulders, detached from a neighboring cliff, projected from the shallow shore and raised their dark gray shapes, in heavy shadow, among the slender weeds and light-sprayed bushes that grew upon the rich alluvium collected around them.</p> 
               <p>The sportsmen sat quietly in their covert, and carefully watched the edges of the forest and the quiet banks, through their leafy screen. For some time all was still, as if no living thing existed within the range of sight or sound. The fresh northerly breeze had died out; and not a whisper disturbed, the death-like repose of the scene, upon which the warm sunshine slept, as upon a beautiful, painted picture. Now and then the tops of the tallest trees just quivered with a passing breath of air; but, in the deep bosom of the woods, all was as motionless as if the rich and lovely landscape had just grown up under the hand of the Creator, and stood awaiting in virgin silence the coming of its animal and elemental life.</p> 
               <p>But, presently, Butler's watchful eye caught a slight motion among the tops of a thicket of alders, that fringed the water edge of a little glad opening upon the shore some distance above them. A large deer stepped out of the bushes, and paused to cast a long and careful look in every direction. Nothing appearing to excite his suspicions, the timid animal drank copiously from the water, and, after another prolonged survey of the neighborhood, waded into the lake, till the water closed over his back, leaving only his head and neck visible. There he stood motionless, except now and then bending to crop a lily-pad or play with his muzzle in the cooling stream. But a near observer might have seen his dark hazel eyes rolling in constant watchfulness, his ears vibrating to the slightest sound, and his broad nostrils snuffing the gale, to catch the smallest contamination of the air.</p> 
               <p>Butler now drew back into the thicket, and said in a whisper to his younger companion, "I must have a chance at that buck, unless your father wants to try his hand. It's not your turn now, "Will."</p> 
               <p>"I sha'n't make any claim, James," replied the Captain, in the same cautious tone. "I am very comfortable with my back against this tree, and will leave the deer to you."</p> 
               <p>"Well, but please lend me your red bandanna handkerchief for a few minutes." The Captain immediately complied with the request, without a word, for he understood very well the purpose of it. William<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6274-00000107"/> liam also drew his ramrod from his gun, and handed it to Butler, who attached one side of it by the corners to the stick, like a little flag. Passing it back to William, he said, as he turned to go, "Now, Bill, I shall try to get down to the beaver-dam across the brook. It will be a long shot, but I think I can bring him down from there. If he should get startled, you know how to use the flag."</p> 
               <p>Young Dee nodded assent; and Butler, withdrawing under the cover of the deep woods, crept guardedly to the point he had indicated, and was immediately lost to sight among the trees. William again posted himself where he could observe the yet unsuspecting object of attack. The deer still remained quiet. But after a few minutes, whether tired of his luxurious cold bath or warned by his acute senses of some questionable appearances, he turned and waded towards the shore. Now was the time to put to its use the little flag that Butler's caution had provided. Concealing his person carefully behind the dense foliage, William raised the rod as high as he could reach, and waved it gently in the air, where the breaks in the boughs permitted it to be seen from the lake. Its bright hue and fluttering motion attracted directly the attention of the wary creature; and he turned to gaze upon it, with the earnest curiosity displayed by these animals for any extraordinary and mysterious sight. The poor, deluded victim paused a moment, to look and wonder; then resumed once more his way to the land. But, at the edge of the bushes, he stopped again to take another long look at the strange and brilliant object. That delay was fatal to him. A thin puff of smoke burst from the bushes, at the edge of the beaver-dam; and a rifle-ball set the speculations of his bewildered brain at rest forever.</p> 
                
               <p>Young Dee, throwing down the gaudy and fatal instrument of delusion, hastened to join his friend; and the two dragged the body of the animal into the thicket where they had kept their watch, just as Shirk, who had heard the shot, entered it, attended by Marquis, from the other side.</p> 
               <p>"Been making more work for my knife, James? I knowed your rifle didn't often go off for nothin'. That's a handsome buck; two prongs to his antlers, three years old, and fat as butter. Joe's jest got out yonder with his sled. I'll clean this feller up in a minute or two, and he can have a ride along o' the bear. But I s'pose he'd like to be properly dressed first." So Sam, laughing at his own wit, took charge of the new prize.</p> 
               <p>The deer was soon put into what Shirk considered proper travelling trim; and the whole party retraced their steps to the spot where Sibley, with his bear, awaited them.</p> 
               <p>"A nice buck," said Joe, casting his practiced eye upon the last accession to their spoils. "Not a bad mornin's work; and now, by the time we get back, dinner'll be ready for us."</p> 
               <p>Here Captain Dee interposed, "Much obliged to you, Joe; but it will take us three or four miles out of our way, if we are going down river to night. I think we had better keep straight on. What with the exercise this confounded bear of yours has given me, I think a twenty-mile tramp at the end of it will be enough for my old bones."</p> 
               <p>"Now you," replied Sibley, "Liddy'll be disappinted; she's been fussin' all the mornin'. And, if yer tired, stay over night, and go down to-morrow."</p> 
               <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6274-00000108"/> 
               <p>"I think we must start to-day, Joe: what do you say, James?"</p> 
               <p>"I can't stop longer than to-day this time, Joe. So, if Captain Dee doesn't feel like tacking four miles onto our walk, and I think it were better not, we must head for home. We have crackers and cheese enough for a lunch in our pockets; and Sam can cut a steak from either of these animals to take along, if he chooses."</p> 
               <p>"Well, if you won't, I've no more to say. But it's rather mean to be within two miles of a man's house, and go away without your dinners."</p> 
               <p>"It is rather shabby after the trouble your wife's been at. We should have thought of it before we started. But you must make our peace with her. By the way, I promised my mother a hunch of venison; and I must have one of that fellow's hind legs. You keep the rest."</p> 
               <p>"You an't goin' to lug a quarter of that buck twenty miles, are you? I wouldn't if I didn't have a dinner for a month. I've been thinkin' of goin' down to the Falls some days. Let the deer be; and I'll throw a haunch over my horse, and bring it down to you to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>"That will be capital, Joe. Bring it down with you, if you will; and try a bit of it with us."</p> 
               <p>The four travellers then shook hands with the hospitable backwoodsman, and the parties separated for their several destinations, Shirk taking up, as they passed, his package of skins, which he had brought along and deposited in the crotch of a tree, with the provident purpose of alleviating the burden of their transportation, by dividing it into two stages. Butler and William Dee also lightened his heavy load by each rolling up a couple of them under his own arm.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head> 
               <p>AS the party bound towards the sea-coast set themselves in motion homeward, a change in the atmosphere began to make itself apparent. The clear, cool northerly breeze that, playing among the tree-tops, was felt in the bosom of the wood in a bracing and invigorating freshness, had died away, and was succeeded by a dead calm, attended with the languid softness that precedes a wind from the warmer regions.</p> 
               <p>Shirk, trudging along under his pack of wolf-skins, soon felt its enervating influence upon his muscles. Even Marquis, whose yet unsatisfied speculations upon the hairy spoils of his late enemies had all along provoked him, from time to time, to worry up over Sam's heels to take a sniff, contented himself with trotting quietly by the side of his master.</p> 
               <p>"The wind's comin' round to the south'ard right away," observed Sam, wiping his perspiring forehead with his sleeve.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," replied Captain Dee, "I saw that long ago. I can smell a sea-wind as far as a crow can scent a dead horse. It seems to me, I can smell smoke in the air too. Is anybody making a burn down below?"</p> 
               <p>"I did not see any smoke as we came up," answered Butler. "And I should not think anybody would set a fire in a dry time like this."</p> 
               <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6274-00000109"/> 
               <p>"Nobody would, that had any gumption," added Shirk. "But Dave Doolittle chopped down a piece this summer, on his clearing; and jest as like as not, he's fired it now. He allers does things jest when he don't ought to. He hardly knows anuf to go to sleep o' nights."</p> 
               <p>"Sam, just slip off your pack, and let Marquis examine it at his leisure, while you climb this tall spruce. You can see from that, a long distance."</p> 
               <p>In obedience to Butler's suggestion, Shirk threw off his burden and his jacket too, and after a hard struggle, for some thirty feet, up the straight trunk of the tree, soon climbed from branch to branch, till he could see over the general surface of the forest. After a moment's survey, he shouted down to his companions, as a man upon a house-top might report to his fellows in the street of a close-built city:-</p> 
               <p>"It's jest as I thought, I'll bet a dollar. I can see Dave's clearing plain anuf; and right beyond it, where his choppin' lays, there's a tarnal big smoke. It's no fool of a fire, I'll be bound. It's blowin' right onto him; and he'll burn hisself up, as sure as can be. What a consarned fool he is! He don't know so much as a yeller dog."</p> 
               <p>"He is a terrible blockhead; and if he has put the fire into his cut-down now, he'll stand a chance to burn up all he's got in the world. Can't we reach there in time to help him, Sam? There's nobody within ten miles of his house."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I think we could,-'tan't more than four miles. But the fire will go like lightnin', if it gets well underway. The smoke grows wuss every minute."</p> 
               <p>"Jump down, then, as quick as your can," interposed Captain Dee; "we'll crowd all sail and get there as soon as possible."</p> 
                
               <p>Shirk speedily descended from his airy perch, and resumed his jacket and his wolf-skins. As soon as he was ready to proceed, they all struck off at an angle from their former course, at a pace as rapid as they could sustain. By the time they had advanced two miles, the woods became full of a dense and choking smoke, which grew more oppressive at every step. Soon it wrapped the forest in a deep shroud, that shut out almost entirely the light of the sun, which appeared, as occasionally seen through the trees, like a dull and lustreless ball of copper. Still they pushed steadily on, though the close and stifling atmosphere made breathing laborious, and the forced exertion drew the perspiration from every pore of their skin. The increasing dimness, that fast enveloped them, rendered it no easy task to keep their course. But they were all familiar with like emergencies; and occasional glances at the trees sufficed to assure their path. At the end of an hour, they struck the river, nearly opposite the clearing of Doolittle; and, after fording its shallow waters over a raft of logs stranded upon the rocks, crossed a corner of the rough field studded over with black stumps and strewn with remnants of burnt trees, and stood, at last, before the door of the proprietor.</p> 
               <p>Thankless mortals seldom appreciate their own good fortune, except by comparison with the lack of the advantages that they enjoy thoughtlessly, for the very reason of their constancy and certainty. The spoilt child of civilization seldom troubles himself to think how the path has been smoothed before him by labors of which he has taken no heed. If he walks or drives, there is the road, levelled by the toil of a thousand arms, hard trodden by the steps of myriad feet. He<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6274-00000110"/> looks out upon landscapes where generations have expended their taste and industry; he revels on delicious fruits planted by hands long ago dust. The spicy luxuries of the East and the products of Western seas, the orange of the tropics and the fur of the Arctic circle, are common in his home, though it may be a humble one,-or may be had in a few minutes out of the vast stores of commerce and ingenious toil. His every want, his idlest whim, may be speedily gratified, if it falls short of a rhinoceros or an anaconda, or modestly asks something less than the Kohinoor.</p> 
               <p>But very different is it in the rude life of the pioneer. He goes far away from all this wealth of comfort and contrivance, to engage in that primeval struggle with Nature that has been the task of man from the beginning. Without the machinery and numberless devices by which invention has provided for every want,-which he generally can neither purchase, nor carry with him if he could purchase them,-he goes into the contest single-handed, and with hardly more artificial resources than his barbarian ancestors in the German forests. Inch by inch, and blow by blow, he must work his way by main force, and, in the midst of privations both great and small, defend himself and those he loves from hunger and cold, and win from the reluctant wilderness the reward of unremitting labor. To a man less resolute and sinewy, his task would be a hopeless impossibility. He must often traverse miles of forest-path for a handful of nails or a pound of tea, if, indeed, in his isolation, he can command the means to buy them. He must sometimes carry on his back, over miles of rugged road, board by board, the materials to finish his log-hut. But, in all these severe toils, there is the sure hope of ultimate success. For, in his poverty of appliances, he carries with him the persevering confidence, if he lacks the resources of civilization; and he has at least the axe and the plough,-the two great instruments of progress.</p> 
               <p>But David Doolittle was an unfavorable specimen of this class of men, in some respects. Honest, industrious, and painstaking, he was one of the unfortunate individuals who, to use the common and expressive phrase, "have no faculty." He did not know how to manage matters to advantage; or, if he knew how, he never did it. The cart was always before the horse, with him. There was always something too much or too little, too soon or too late. It was easy to account for much of his difficulty by a glance at his premises. His cart and tools were always to be seen laying about exposed to the weather; and frequently more time was consumed in putting them in order for use, than in doing the work for which they were required. No slough in his daily path was ever filled up, no stone taken out of the way, no obnoxious stump cut out. So David and his team and family blundered on, day after day, through all manner of obstacles, which half the labor employed in overcoming them might have put out of the way forever; and a vast amount of irritation, vexation, and loss daily endured, only to be duplicated on the next and every other day of their lives. Unfortunately, too, the wife was untidy and shiftless as her husband; and the necessary consequence was, that endless trouble, in doors and out, destroyed alike all comfort for the present and all hope for the future; and a sullen and cheerless gloom settled over the despairing household.</p> 
               <p>At this crisis in his fortunes, the friendly visitors<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6274-00000111"/> found David standing in front of his log-hut, gazing mournfully and helplessly at the black volumes of smoke that rolled threateningly up in one enormous billowy cloud, from behind a long ridge of land, whose crest, perhaps a quarter of a mile distant, yet intercepted the view of the flames that were raging in the forest beyond.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Dave!" shouted Shirk, as, coming up with Butler, he threw down his bundle of wolf-skins. "What on airth are you gaping at, with a fire like that right on you?"</p> 
               <p>"What could I do to fight sich a fire as that, all alone?" replied Doolittle despondently.</p> 
               <p>"To be sure a thousand men couldn't stop that blaze now, with the Narraguagus to back 'em. But you may save your buildings, perhaps, David, if you bestir yourself, and we've made a hard march to come to your help," said Butler.</p> 
               <p>"And what shall I do? In half an hour 'twill be rainin' sparks and cinders like a snow-storm. But thank you for comin,'-all the same."</p> 
               <p>"Well, well. Let's try and do what we can; and Providence must take care of the rest. Don't give up without a struggles for it. Where are your cattle?"</p> 
               <p>"Out in the field yonder, a piece; but you can't see 'em, no more than if 'twas midnight, for the smoke."</p> 
               <p>"Yoke 'em up; and take your boy here and a chain, and start back twenty or thirty lengths of the cedar fence that joins the corner of your barn. The fire will run on it like lightning. Shirk to that till it drives you off; we'll do what else can be done poor here."</p> 
               <p>Inspirited by Butler's energetic tones, that poor fellow's sluggish face lighted up with a faint show of hope. "Thank ye, thank ye, God bless ye!" he sobbed out. "But don't let the little ones and the woman get burnt up in the house. She's packin' up things inside. Come, Hiram, and bring the chain. It's down alongside the wheels there."</p> 
               <p>Taking the yoke upon his shoulders, Doolittle moved off with his boy; and Butler and Sam turned to hold counsel with the Dees, who had just come up,-for the Captain was sorely out of wind, and leaned heavily on his son's arm.</p> 
               <p>"Phew, phew," sputtered out the Captain. "I'm fairly blown, and hang me if there's a breath of air fit for a Christian to swallow. It's as close as the devil's back parlor. But we must go to work; and there's no time to lose."</p> 
               <p>So saying, and wiping his forehead diligently, he took a rapid survey of the premises, as well as the dense smoke allowed. Doolittle's architectural efforts had been upon the simplest and meanest scale; but poor as the results were, they were everything to him. A small and low log-house, roofed with hemlock bark, and, a "hovel," or little barn of the same rude materials and workmanship, partially surrounded by a cow-yard and buttressed at one end by a pig-sty, composed all the accommodations for man or beast. A large cleared field interposed between the buildings and the woodland beyond, in which the conflagration was raging. The removal of the fence that separated the clearing from the forest, as suggested by Butler, insulated the homestead from all direct communication with the combustible material around, and afforded a faint hope of saving the buildings from the cinders, which alone could communicate the fire. The chance, nevertheless, was at best a very doubtful one. A<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6274-00000112"/> brisk southwest wind was now blowing full upon the roofs, constructed of material ignitable to the highest degree, and dried by the long heats of summer to the utmost. Scorching currents poured over them, under the intense heat of which the last vestiges of moisture oozed, from each crack and cranny, in slender wreaths of stream.</p> 
               <p>After throwing down their coats and guns, the younger men set about their precautionary measures, while Captain Dee went to superintend proceedings within the house, where the wife of Doolittle was hurrying about, as much stupefied and bewildered as her husband had been, before his energies were cuffed into activity by the friendly remonstrances of his newly arrived assistants. But under the Captain's brisk orders, the humble household wealth was soon packed up for removal, and every utensil available for holding water, from the milk-pitcher to the wash-tubs and empty pork-barrels, was mustered at the door and filled as rapidly as possible from the neighboring spring.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile Butler, William, and Shirk wistfully surveyed the barn; that, being many rods nearer to the edge of the woods, was far more exposed to danger than the house, which fortunately stood nearly in the centre of the field.</p> 
               <p>"William," said Butler, "if we can save the hovel here, there will be a good chance for the house. But if this catches, it is all over with both."</p> 
               <p>"That's it," interposed Shirk; "it's jest so, James; but what in time are we goin' to do? I'm dead beat where to begin. I don't wonder old Dave feels down to heel."</p> 
               <p>"We must try to cover this roof somehow. When the fire once gets this side of the hill, it will be hotter here than Tophet, and the first cinder will kindle those cedar splits, as if they were gunpowder."</p> 
               <p>"But what to cover it with?" asked William.</p> 
               <p>"Sure enough, Bill, that's the pinch. Dirt,-'twill take too long. Ah! your wolf-skins, Sam. Untie your bundle quick as winking. I'm in hopes they may cover the windward side at least."</p> 
               <p>Sam rushed to his pack, and, untying the cord, jerked out, one after another, a dozen or more shaggy pelts; while, as tawny muzzles, legs, and bushy tails once more assumed partially their life semblance, poor Marquis, half frightened, half quarrelsome, darted to and fro round them, giving a hasty snap and shake to some protruding member, then hurriedly retreating with furious barks and growls.</p> 
               <p>"Get out o' that, Mark; we've got something besides play on hand, old feller. Them chaps are goin' to do some good now, for the first time in their lives. James, I'll climb up yonder, and you pass 'em up while I spread 'em."</p> 
               <p>Giving a gentle box on the ears to the dog, who was persisting in his skirmishes with the lifeless remains of enemies that still excited his canine imagination to a wrathful terror, Sam climbed from the top of the ox-wheels upon the low roof, and rapidly laid the pelts smoothly over the whole, from the ridge-pole downward. A load of light spruce poles fortunately lay hard by, by the help of which, with the aid of loose' stones, the skins were snugly secured. That side was covered, with the exception of one corner, over which Sam threw his woolen frock.</p> 
               <p>"There, James, if them 'ere, don't stand some heat, then I can't guess. Them green skins an't got a mite o' burn to 'em. But now about t'other side. I wish<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6274-00000113"/> we had another dozen of the varmint's hides; but wishin' won't do any good."</p> 
               <p>"But these will," said William Dee, staggering out of the barn under an overshadowing pile of deer-skins and a large ox-hide trailing behind him. I found these in a corner of the hovel." So saying, he threw his load upon the ground, producing anew an intense excitement in the nervous system of Marquis, who expanded immediately into a foray upon this reinforcement of hirsute abominations.</p> 
               <p>"Good on your head, William! What a fool I was not to have thought o' that! Anybody might 'a knowed a man in the woods would have a pile of deerskins in his barn, unless a pedlar had jest been round. There's the old ox's hide too, that the bears killed for poor Dave last spring; blast their picturs! Pass 'em up, pass 'em up. I'll shingle 'em on in less than no time."</p> 
               <p>"If you'll hand them up to Sam, James, I'll go for three or four more which I could not fetch. Lay them on thick, Sam, there's plenty, and more too."</p> 
               <p>In a few minutes, the opposite slope of the roof was closely covered with this opportune supply; and, after careful adjustment of all loose corners, and ballasting here and there with some additional stones, Shirk jumped down to the ground, his job completed to his perfect satisfaction.</p> 
               <p>"There, I rather guess that's the fust buildin' was ever shingled with skins, in 'Guagus valley, anyhow. That'll keep the fire out from July to eternity, I'll guarantee. It's all-fired hot and stiflin' though, to work in. But here's another job yet. Jest see that hay-winder in the gable, gapin' wide open. The cinders'll be runshin' in there shortly, like destruction. That tormented, Lazy Dave's never made a shutter for it, though it's two years he's had this hovel built; no more he won't, until it's rotted down agin."</p> 
               <p>"There's the ox-hide yet. If we can find a hammer and a handful of nails, we'll fix that in a jiffy."</p> 
               <p>"I'll have 'em directly, James. I saw a hammer and some shingle-nails inside."</p> 
               <p>The ox-hide was soon closely tacked up over the aperture, and the trio paused from their arduous labor to wide their brows and congratulate themselves on their success in this quarter. Two or three empty pork-barrels, were then rolled out from the barn, and, with the help of Captain Dee's crew,-as the old gentleman styled the forlorn Mrs. Doolittle and two ragged, bareheaded, and barefooted urchins,-they were soon filled with water from a hollow in the brook hard by, scooped out to water the cattle in. Thus all was done that ingenuity could suggest to meet the impending danger.</p> 
               <p>"How have you got along at the house, father?"</p> 
               <p>"O, all's right there, William. The traps are all packed up, and I have got everything filled with water but the hair-sieve and the cullender, and stowed all round outside. And you've done a good job with the hovel there; first-rate plan, whosever it is. It puzzles Marquis, and I don't wonder at it. Come here, dog! what are you bobbing up and down at those tails and legs for? You can't reach 'em, and they won't trouble you any more. Well, boys, I think we can stand the siege now with some chance; that is, if we don't get choked to death. Now let's wash our throats out; and you and I, Sam, can take a pipe, before the fire gets up with us."</p> 
               <p>While the Captain looked up his canteen and dispensed<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6274-00000114"/> pensed a moderate portion of its refreshing contents among the tired and heated party, Doolittle came in with his oxen and his son, and reported that they had hauled off all the fence within dangerous contiguity. The whole now seated or stretched themselves on the ground to rest and watch the approach of their terrible adversary.</p> 
               <p>The fire had now reached the crest of the ridge in front of them; and occasional flashes began to be seen through the veil of smoke, which, lighted up at its lower edge by a dull red glare, had been hitherto the only indication, to the eye, of the progress of the destructive element. A rolling wave broke along over the outlines of the hills, feeding upon the fallen leaves and branches, shrubs and other scattered materials upon the surface. From this ground-line, tongues of flame shot curling into the air, borne upward by the eddies of the heated atmosphere and carried irresistibly forward by the wind, that urged on its devouring march. Wrapping, at once, in its red mantle the straggling brushwood and undergrowth of young saplings, it darted upon the lower limbs of the resinous trees, and, leaping from branch to branch, turned the tall hemlocks, spruces, and pines, in an instant, into pyramids of fire. The hard-wood trees, less inflammable, smoked and wilted in the intense heat, till the victorious flames, after a few moments of delay, swept their red banners triumphant over the crisped foliage. The jets rushed up over the pitch-laden spray of the evergreens, with a crackle like the spattering hiss of a thousand rockets; and the heavy, concentrated murmur of the advancing blaze swelled like the thundering surges of a stormy sea. Far in front of the sweeping flames, showers of sparks and cinders filled the air; and kindled, here and there, little conflagrations, preparing the way for the furious tide of destruction that raged along behind. The dense, hot smoke and ashes flew in clouds upon the van of the terrible onslaught; and the bright flashes, seen through their sombre veil, acquired a lurid and concentrated glow, like an unearthly pandemonium.</p> 
               <p>The position of the occupants of Doolittle's homestead would have been utterly untenable by mortal endurance, had not the conflagration slackened and finally died out, as it reached the back line of the clearing, for want of further food in that direction. But on the flanks of the field it still maintained its progress, spreading wider and wider as it rolled along. Upon the quarter where they sat watching the barn, the proximity of the raging element and the direction of the wind made their situation almost intolerable, notwithstanding that one side was now free from annoyance. The cessation of the fire in that quarter, however, together with the decreasing distance between them and the burning timber, rendered the smoke less thick and oppressive; as the ascending currents, created by the intense heat and the upward rush of the flames, lifted its heavy clouds somewhat over their heads, and made respiration easier. They maintained their guard over the buildings patiently, sheltering themselves from the blinding storm of sparks and ashes by fastening their handkerchiefs over their faces, to serve as veils. With this help they were able to support a recumbent position upon the ground, if not with comfort, without much serious suffering.</p> 
               <p>"I should think this 'ere the handsomest sight I ever see," said Shirk, "if 'twas only a little farder off. If I was fatter, I should expect to run down into my boots, like taller in a candle-mould."</p> 
               <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6274-00000115"/> 
               <p>"You needn't fear melting, Sam," chuckled Captain Dee. "There's no more grease in your anatomy than in an old baboon's. You'd dry up and burn, like the leaves out yonder."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Captain, 'tan't no great of a choice 'twixt meltin' and fryin'; about t'other and which, I reckon. It's a case anyhow. I don't think I shall get cool again afore the next snow-storm. But jest look at old Dave, Captain," added Sam, in a lower voice; for, though his tone indicated contempt, Shirk was too kind-hearted to wound the feelings of its object. "He's jest like a wet rag. If we hadn't come along, he'd a sot there and let everything burn up."</p> 
               <p>Doolittle's appearance certainly justified the criticism. He was seated at a little distance on the end of a log, with his hands in his pockets and a short pipe in his mouth, which, however, he had forgotten to fill, looking uneasily from the buildings that contained his all of worldly goods to the destruction that threatened them, with a look of wistful helplessness sadly at variance with the emergency. His listless gaze was like that of the despondent eye of the sick man, expressive at once of trouble, and of deep consciousness of lack of strength to combat it. But the look brightened as it rested upon the more energetic friends whom his good fortune had sent to his aid, as if capacity of action was not wanting, if it were only called out and directed by external support. His whole garb and all the surroundings wore the same shiftless aspect; from his old, battered hat and ragged garments to the wretched farming tools and domestic appliances scattered all about, not only out of place and order, but with an unmistakable air that no place or order at all were among the conditions of their existence.</p> 
                
               <p>"Yes, Sam. David is a poor manager, that's too clear. But a man out here in the woods, without neighbors, without tools, roads, without almost everything in fact, but his hands, has a hard chance. If he hasn't energy to get the better of difficulties, they can't but get the better of him; and he grows to be content with poor, miserable make-shifts, till he gives up in despair everything he can live without. If he's right smart, he makes his path clear and smooth at last; if not, he worries along through the sloughs and stumps for his life-time."</p> 
               <p>"That's jest so, Captain," rejoined Shirk earnestly. "I was in jest sich a fix once myself, and made up my mind pretty often that 'twas easier to go without things than to get 'em. And I shouldn't a' been no better than a beggar now, James, if your mother hadn't gi'n me a lift. God bless her! and He will that. I wish I knew how to do as much good to somebody as she's done for me. It's a'most too much to think of; it plagues me a'most as bad as poor David's needcessities does him. I'd die forty times over, sooner'n put your mother out once, James. And you an't been slow to help me yourself nuther; nor you nuther, Captain Dee, nor all on 'em, for the matter o' that."</p> 
               <p>Here poor Sam's grateful recollections choked him, and he began to stammer. Regaining his voice and wiping his tell-tale eyes with his sleeve, he apologetically added,-</p> 
               <p>"What a tormented fool I'm actin' like!"</p> 
               <p>"No, you an't, Sam," replied Captain Dee; "you're talking like an honest and true man. And, if you said anything else of James and his mother, I should be tempted to whop you, old as I am. As for me, I've done little or nothing but treat you as you deserved to<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6274-00000116"/> be. You're a good fellow, Sam; and don't be fool enough to be ashamed of it." And the kind-hearted old Captain shook Shirk's hand cordially, which brought the tears back again into his eyes.</p> 
               <p>"Well, when you're ashamed o' me agin, any on ye, jest shoot me. I'd thank you to, sooner than look ye in the eyes arter it."</p> 
               <p>"No, no, Sam. We shouldn't do any such thing; there would be several serious objections. But never fear; there'll be no occasion. You're all right."</p> 
               <p>"Well, if I be, I'd oughter; I don't desarve no credit for't. But I don't know but I've been too hard on poor Dave. He han't had sich a friend as I have; and that 'ere woman of his would drag most men down, I should judge by the looks on her. She an't no account at all, to my mind; a nasty, mismanaging,' good-for-nothin' slut. She looks jest like somethin' the cat's brought into the house. If I had sich a woman, I'd"-</p> 
               <p>"Put up with her, as well as you could, I guess, Sam. But may be you are a little too hard with her too. Perhaps she does as well as she knows how."</p> 
               <p>"P'raps she does. But I don't see the use of a woman that can't keep things decent, and throws 'em out o' the winder as fast as her husband can bring 'em in at the door."</p> 
               <p>Sam uttered this unsentimental comment upon conjugal relations with a tone that seemed to say that it settled the question beyond all legitimate controversy. Their attention, moreover, was drawn to more pressing matters, for the conflagration was now fast reaching the woods immediately in their front. They could see, where they sat, the burning fragments whirled through the air before the fierce breath of the fire, and kindling, in detached spots, still further on. Close upon these followed the eager flames, lapping up with their hot tongues the withered brakes, fallen leaves, and every other combustible thing upon the surface of the ground. Then leaped after them the towering flashes, seizing with the rapidity of lightning upon the already heated and dried foliage of the trees, and seeming to scale the very skies, as they darted, crackling and hissing, up the tall trunks, and shot out in greedy whirls to the utmost extremity of every limb. From this glowing furnace, the heavy clouds of smoke rolled up in tortuous columns, till they formed a dense, canopy that floated slowly to leeward, and then, descending again as it grew heavier by cooling, enveloped the woods and ground in an almost impenetrable shroud.</p> 
               <p>As the magnificent but destructive spectacle swept down close before them, conversation ceased in an absorbing observation of the terrible grandeur of the scene. The spectators gazed silently at the brilliant bursts of flame flashing through the deep curtains of smoke, and watched anxiously every cinder that flew over the buildings they were so solicitous to save. After a few moments of stillness, unbroken except by the exulting crackle of the voracious elements, as it spread its red sheets in triumph over shrub after shrub and tree after tree, a low, wild bleat was heard in front of them, and the branches of a clump of young firs waved and parted. In an instant or two, a spotted fawn, of four or five months old, broke from the thicket, and, clearing the log-fence at a bound, continued its headlong flight, till it paused amazed in the very centre of the group. Marquis, carried away by his sporting instincts, greeted the sudden visitor with a sharp bark of surprise, and darted upon the little fugitive<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6274-00000117"/> with merciless alacrity. But William arrested the attack with a sharp "Down, down, sir!" and rescued the frightened creature from its new danger. The graceful and timid animal, appalled apparently by the threatened destruction from which it had fled and by the strange society into which its frantic rush had brought it, crouched trembling at his feet, without any further attempt to escape, his deep, dark eyes fastening themselves, in wonder and mute entreaty, on the boy's kind face, as he bent protectingly over him.</p> 
               <p>"Poor little fellow! He has lost his mother in the hurry-scurry, and is frightened out of his wits." So saying, he gently took up the panting runaway, and carried him into a calf-pen which he had observed in the barn, where he laid him softly upon a bed of straw.</p> 
               <p>"Take him home and tame him, William," said his father; "he will make a pretty pet. Marquis will soon learn to live in peace with him. I don't know how he'll get along with old Poll, though, if she takes it into her head to grudge him his dinner."</p> 
               <p>Before William could return from securing his little captive, the attention of all was arrested by a loud scream; and, looking toward the house, they saw Mrs. Doolittle, from whose musical throat the outcry proceeded, pointing upwards energetically with one skinny arm, from which the fragments of her ragged sleeve depended in picturesque streamers. Following the indication of her gesture, they saw, with alarm, a light wreath of smoke curling up from the back covering of the roof.</p> 
               <p>"D--n it all!" shouted Captain Dee; "that confounded house means to get on fire, after all out trouble." Dashing down his pipe, he rushed, as fast as his short and tired legs could carry him, to the scene of new danger.</p> 
               <p>But the younger men outstripped the less efficient alacrity of the good Captain. Before he reached the spot, Shirk had clambered, with a desperate bound, upon the low roof, and dashed upon the incipient flames a bucket of water handed up to him by Butler. The stray cinder, that had lodged in a crevice of the sheets of hemlock bark, was speedily extinguished; and a few more pailfuls of water thoroughly averted the threatening peril.</p> 
               <p>The triumphant Sam tossed down the last empty bucket; but, as he waved his cap in a victorious hurra, he suddenly disappeared from sight through the frail covering with a loud crash,-to the mutual consternation of himself and his friends below. Before, however, the astonished spectators of the catastrophe recovered their self-possession, his bronzed face was stuck up through the shattered bark, enlivened by a broad grin that assured them of his escape from bodily harm.</p> 
               <p>"No bones broken yet; but your garret floor an't so soft as a feather-bed, Dave. No harm done, but a few pailfuls of water leaked down into the room below there; and I don't think Miss Doolittle will be much troubled about that," said Sam, with a somewhat maliciously significant laugh. "But I guess I won't trust your ruff agin. I'll come down the ladder inside here."</p> 
               <p>In a moment Sam descended the primitive staircase and rejoined his companions, undamaged by his involuntary exploit.</p> 
               <p>It soon became evident that there was no risk of a recurrence of the danger so happily prevented; for<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6274-00000118"/> the fire had now passed far beyond the buildings, and reaching the river at many points, was arrested by the water, or the low and swampy grounds in its neighborhood. Although it still raged and roared where material remained to feed its fury, it was clear the crisis was past. The space, passed over by its ravages, now lay a blank waste, where nothing was to be seen but black, charred, and mutilated trees and gray ashes,-except that here and there the remnants of the dense thickets still burned feebly; and the fire yet clung tenaciously to the half-rotted stumps and the dry fallen timber; and quivering tongues of flame danced still upon the half-consumed extremities of the branches of the trees, standing in sombre ruin, stripped of every vestige of vegetation.</p> 
               <p>The volunteer protectors of the rescued homestead were now proceeding to gather up their equipments, and resume their interrupted journey; but Mrs. Doolittle interposed the usual backwoods hospitality, with the cordial zeal prompted by her lively sense of the services rendered, in their almost hopeless extremity.</p> 
               <p>"Ye an't goin' without nothin' to eat,-and not had yer dinners nuther, for fightin' this dreadful fire,-sartin sure! Mr. Doolittle, can't you jest take a pail and get me some fresh water? I'Il get sumthin' or nuther ready, in a little while. But I'm sorry the foxes has stole all our chickins."</p> 
               <p>"I'm sorry too," muttered Shirk, in an aside to William. "It's a pity they don't love wimmin."</p> 
               <p>Captain Dee and Butler both attempted to excuse themselves from the experiment of her grateful but questionable kindness, by the plea, that they had still a long walk before them and could rely on the luncheon yet untouched in their pockets. But, finding the good woman's sensitiveness deeply involved in the point, they good-naturedly consented to stay and abide their chances. So the master of the house started for the spring, in furtherance of the labors of his helpmate; and Captain Dee returned to his pipe, left half smoked in the hurry of the late alarm, accompanied by his fellow-travellers.</p> 
               <p>"Captain Dee," said Shirk, as he adjusted his back against a log and prepared his own pipe, "I wish you hadn't agreed to stop. That 'ere woman 'll pison us all, I do believe. She's jest as like as not to boil up a bull-frog in the tea, and get a shovel or two of ashes into the vittles."</p> 
               <p>"O Sam, don't you worry yourself any more! We couldn't get away without affronting her. You know we must eat a peck of dirt in the course of our lives; and you may just as well take a few spoonfuls of your allowance now as at anytime; and as for the tea; let's hope for the best. May be we'll get off with a pollywog or two. I never knew you to be so spiteful, Sam."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I can't help it, Captain. All is, if I had sich a woman, I'd"-</p> 
               <p>Whether Sam's marital indignation was too great for utterance, or whether he deprecated the risk of the Captain's displeasure, he never finished the sentence, but applied himself industriously to the preparation of his tobacco.</p> 
               <p>The conflagration had now rolled far away to leeward; and the brisk southwest wind had driven off the smoke before it, though small columns still rose in some places into the air, from spots where the flames had found the most abundant material. Isolated fires were yet burning actively, and the old stumps smoked<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6274-00000119"/> in dull combustion; but the desolated forest around stood, a black mass of scorched skeletons, stripped of all that was readily inflammable, and doomed to silent and mouldering decay.</p> 
               <p>The balmy breeze again furnished an atmosphere fit for respiration, although a strong and pungent taint of smoke pervaded it. Great was the relief to the wearied men, who had been compelled to exert their physical endurance to the utmost, not only in the severe labor they had undergone, but also in the exhausting annoyance and irritation of the almost intolerable cloud of smoke and ashes. They were all well content to rest their tired limbs and sore lungs, in quiet enjoyment of restored comfort, until Mrs. Doolittle's shrill scream informed them that her labors in their behalf had reached their accomplishment.</p> 
               <p>When they had seated themselves around the tottering and broken-legged table that unsteadily supported its hospitable load, they found Sam's evil prognostics at fault,-at least so far as was obvious to the senses. Notwithstanding the delinquencies of the foxes and the unthriftiness that generally made Doolittle's larder anything but luxurious, the poor woman's sincere exertions for their comfort had met with a reward not always vouchsafed to her good intentions. The first and main course consisted, indeed, only of rashers of pork and boiled potatoes. But it was backed up by a plate of good hot bread and fresh butter, and further recommended to the appetite by a very tolerable decoction of tea, the value of which fragrant cordial is nowhere more appreciated than in the simple diet of frontier life. Shirk was compelled to confess that he could not detect even a tadpole to disturb its relish; and if any illegitimate ingredients were present in the other viands, there was no outward evidence of the fact. Therefore, by rule of law and Christian charity alike, their innocence was to be presumed. A pie made of fresh berries and a dessert of the same native luxuries, which are afforded in such abundance from all the nooks and corners of a new clearing, in a virgin soil, completed a repast, perfectly satisfactory to the simple and hearty appetites of the guests. Nobody was disposed to criticise the incongruous character of the table furniture; although the cups were nearly all of different patterns, and mismatched with saucers that still farther increased the variety, the plates of different colors and sizes, and the knives and forks apparently ambassador samples from half the manufacturers in England.</p> 
               <p>After the meal was dispatched, the travellers prepared to take leave of their entertainers. It was arranged with Doolittle that he should, on the morrow, drive down his ox-cart, bringing with him the little fawn, Sam's wolf-skins, and his own deer-hides, which he wished to trade off at the village for articles needed more than ever in his household, in consequence of the late disaster.</p> 
               <p>Shaking hands with David, whose moist eyes and nervous grasp bespoke his gratitude even better than the voluble and reiterated thanks of his wife, the little party turned their backs upon the dismal trunks of the scorched and dismantled neighborhood, and started once more for home. But it was not till after midnight that they laid, their heads upon their pillows to enjoy the sweet rest doubly earned by severe toil and the pleasant conviction of good done to a fellowman.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head> 
               <p>SHORTLY after the expedition we have recounted, as Butler left home one morning after breakfast, he saw Squire Preston coming up the road towards him at a furious rate. As soon as within hearing, the lawyer shouted out,-</p> 
               <p>"Good-morning, Butler; I've been looking everywhere for you."</p> 
               <p>"Except at home, where I might reasonably be supposed to be," added James, laughing.</p> 
               <p>"That's rich, on my word. Why, as long as I've lived in Merrifield, I have never looked for a man at home, except at dinner and bed-time. We're out-of-door folks here. But hang that. We want to get you to sit upon a reference this morning."</p> 
               <p>"Which is about the most uncomfortable seat you can invite a man to occupy," said Butler, still laughing.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I don't dispute that point; and I don't propose it as an object of either pleasure or profit. But this is a matter of Christian charity. You've heard of the famous case of Oliver Vail <abbr>vs.</abbr> Sam Aiken. No! well so much the better. Now those two idiots have been in a quarrel these four years about an infernal yearling ram. The case has been through all the courts, but no jury could ever agree; it has been carried up on all sorts of law points, but there's no point in the law on which it will stick. At last, after spending their last dollars, and in despair of ever settling it in any less rational and more expensive way, the fools have agreed to what they might have done as well the first day,-to leave it to the common sense of three of their neighbors to say which is the bigger blockhead of the two. One of the referees is sick, and can't come; and you have been agreed on to take his place."</p> 
               <p>"And a pleasant place too, according to your account, Squire. I should prefer not to take it."</p> 
               <p>"O, don't refuse, for Heaven's sake! The thing's been in everybody's mouth for years. Not a man, woman, or child within forty miles that hasn't quarreled it threadbare. There isn't another man in the county but you that we can get the parties agreed on; for they suppose everybody else committed to one side or the other. If you don't come, we shall never see an end to it, till the millenium."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Squire, how long is it since you gentlemen of the law have been so anxious to terminate lawsuits? I thought your interest lay in nursing them up to the last minute."</p> 
               <p>"Pooh, pooh. We lawyers have to take in hand all the dirty doings of all the rest of you, to prevent your knocking out each other's brains in the streets. We are the moral washerwomen of the community. Of course we must see that we don't starve. That would be very uncomfortable to us, and a great loss to the public. But our consciences are as good, at least, as the average. Besides, we know better than to kill outright the geese that lay our golden eggs."</p> 
               <p>"The geese ought to feel obliged to you for your consideration. But it seems you sometimes employ the geese to settle their own quarrels."</p> 
               <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6274-00000121"/> 
               <p>"Certainly, when we find the quarrel is so goose-like that nobody but geese can settle it. But come along, that's a good fellow. We'll make you chief justice of the court."</p> 
               <p>"Well, since you place the matter in such a complimentary point of view, I don't see but I must."</p> 
               <p>The two gentlemen then walked across the bridge, to the office of Mr. Preston, a dingy den over one of the stores, where the Goddess of Justice held her sessions for that vicinity. As they approached, they found the contiguous corners and street sprinkled with a promiscuous crowd, gathered by business or curiosity from a circle of some miles about the village.</p> 
               <p>In the days of the good old rule- <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"That he should take that has the power,</l> 
                        <l rend="ti-1">And he should keep who can,"</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q> men settled their petty differences mainly by hard knocks. As civilization and social order get the better of violence and force, law supersedes the natural remedies of fist and knife, for real or supposed injuries. In course of time, knowledge and refinement do much to repress litigation. Men find out that quarreling is alike troublesome and unprofitable. But the ruder stages of society are generally litigious. The pugnacity and disposition to seek immediate reparation or vengeance for a wrong, inherent in human nature, have not yet been tamed down to social courtesy. Rough and uneducated men, if they do not take the law into their own hands, are very apt, at least, to keep their hands in the law; and make as prompt and eager use of the milder means of offense and defense still left to them, as they would of their own brawny arms and boisterous passions, if they were freed from the restrictions of civic order. Merrifield, like most frontier places, exemplified this fact to a considerable extent. The justice of the peace and the lawyers found large occupation in adjusting the petty dissensions and pecuniary entanglements of the neighborhood. Upon every Saturday, these dignitaries held a court-leet, with such special intermediate sessions as extraordinary emergencies might require. But on Saturday, the tenants of the outskirting farms and the inhabitants of the neighboring hamlets poured in to this central point, to see what was going on in the court, if they had no business of their own there, and do up all the errands of the week, treasured and reserved for this particular occasion. It was a general fair day, or, considering the peculiar and prominent features of it, a general foul day for a considerable circle of country.</p> 
               <p>As they mingled with the concourse. Butler observed to his companion, but in a tone in which sadness was mingled with the jocoseness that had animated their conversation,-</p> 
               <p>"Your flock of geese seems pretty large, Mr. Preston."</p> 
               <p>"It is indeed," replied the lawyer soberly. "More geese than grass for them, I fear."</p> 
               <p>They pushed their way up a steep and narrow staircase, through the in goers and out-comers, to the low-browed room in the second story, where proceedings were held. Three fourths of the apartment were crowded with men, many in their shirt-sleeves, seated on wooden benches or standing thickly and confusedly about the floor. At its upper part was a platform, raised a single step, upon which stood a few chairs disposed round a long table. The farther end of the table was provided with an arm-chair, appropriated to<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6274-00000122"/> the presiding personage, whoever, for the time, he might be, into which Butler was inducted upon the present occasion. In this portion of the chamber decorum and quiet prevailed, though unaccompanied with any very grave formality. But the audience sat or stood, with hats on or without, smoking, chatting, laughing at each other's jokes, or at any pungent observation or sharp stroke among the legal authorities, with entire ease and nonchalance. Yet amid all this freedom, the old Anglo-Saxon respect to law and adherence to order were apparent, and not less spontaneous than the general easy indifference of demeanor. The constable himself, the sole exponent of public authority, stood laughing and jesting with the multitude, without the smallest external badge or indication of office. Yet, when Butler intimated that all was ready to proceed to the business on hand, all noise and disorder that could interfere with the graver matters were hushed. The two simple words "Order, gentlemen!" were the only thing necessary. The constable sat down on the edge of the platform, ready to wait upon the court, as required; and without further ceremony the trial was commenced.</p> 
               <p>Squire Preston rose, and, selecting the wait from a bundle of papers before him, proceeded to read it, mumbling over and compressing into etc., etc.'s its tedious technicalities.</p> 
               <p>"And the plaintiff comes, etc., etc., and says that on the -- day of --, in the year of our Lord 17-, at Merrifield aforesaid, the said defendant did casually find a certain yearling lamb, ram, or sheep of the value of three dollars, to him the said plaintiff belonging, and then and there wrongfully converted the said yearling, lamb, ram, or sheep to his own use," etc., etc., etc.</p> 
                
               <p>The Squire then passed the writ over to the professional gentleman upon the other side, who scrutinized it carefully, but said nothing. Either by virtue of the legal skill of the one, or the equal or greater ignorance of the mysteries of special pleading on the part of his adversary, the writ seemed unobjectionable. Indeed, its smoky and venerable hue, dogs-eared corners, and rent foldings testified to an experience in hostile investigation that might well defy farther attack. It had evidently passed through an ordeal that might be supposed to have laid bare any weak point, if such existed. At any rate, Squire Punchard, though he looked terribly wise at it, didn't venture to impugn it; and the counsel for the plaintiff went on, uninterrupted by technical impediment.</p> 
               <p>"You are aware, gentlemen referees, that the plain English of this is, that we claim that the defendant, by some means or other, got possession of this animal belonging to my client, and has kept it for his own benefit; and consequently we demand, in this suit, its market value to be paid us, according to law and equity, with suitable damages. I will not detain you by useless explanation, but will now lay before you evidence, that we consider indisputable, of the justice of our claim."</p> 
               <p>Thereupon he read over a list of some dozen witnesses, which he then handed over to the constable. That functionary, who had been discussing a horse-trade, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce,</foreign> with his next neighbor among the spectators, abstracted himself from his individual interests for a moment, and repeated it with official emphasis; and the witnesses ranged themselves in a row before the foot of the table to take the customary oath. William Vail, plaintiff, who was seated beside his counsel<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6274-00000123"/> sel, in all the conscious importance of being one of the two chief personages of the occasion in whose behalf and by whose agency the whole ceremony was instituted, looked at the array with a satisfied smile; while Squire Preston cast upon them a dignified and confident glance, such as a general might throw along the line of a gallant army by whose prowess he trusted to win an impending battle. On the other hand, Sam Aiken, defendant, viewed them with a scowl half deprecating, half indignant, as a set of individuals sadly misguided and mistaken, if not liable to graver imputations; while the face of Squire Punchard assumed an expression of lofty pity, as if he saw in them only a rabble rout, about to be annihilated in due time, by his own superior forces and generalship.</p> 
               <p>In the midst of all this by-play, the plaintiffs counsel called out his leading witness. The sum of his testimony was, that in the spring of the year mentioned in the writ, he had seen a certain yearling ram belonging to the flock of William Vail, turned out to pasture upon the commons with the rest of his woolly associates, and that in the fall of the same year he saw the same animal in Aiken's barn-yard with his flock, and that he heard him refuse to give him up to Vail, claiming him to be his own. There was also testimony as to the mixing up of flocks pasturing on the commons together, the depredations of wolves, and other like contingencies of ovine life in those parts. Having elicited all that the witness knew, and perhaps a little more, Squire Preston blandly turned him over to the tender care of his learned brother; who commenced his cross examination by a slight skirmish upon the details of the testimony, and wound up with a terrific attack upon the essential question of the identity of the subject of controversy.</p> 
                
               <p>"How did you know the animal you saw in the spring and in the fall, to be the same one?"</p> 
               <p>"Cause I know'd his countenance and the looks on him."</p> 
               <p>"How can you tell one sheep from another by its looks?"</p> 
               <p>"Jest as I can tell one lawyer from another by his looks," replied the witness; whereupon the audience indulged themselves in a titter. "Besides, added he, "the ram was marked."</p> 
               <p>"In what way was he marked?" asked the lawyer with solemn earnestness.</p> 
               <p>"His right ear was notched; and he had a V in red paint on his shoulder."</p> 
               <p>"Didn't Aiken mark his sheep with an A?"</p> 
               <p>"I believe he did."</p> 
               <p>"Well, mightn't a man, who was marking a sheep lying in his lap, very easily make an A upside down, from carelessness, that would look very much like a V when the animal stood up?"</p> 
               <p>"Can't say,-never stood the animal upside down to see what the mark would look like. Dare say a man might make a V instead of an A, if he made it upside down, and didn't put no cross to it."</p> 
               <p>The bystanders burst into a roar of laughter at this conclusive answer, which compelled the constable to forego his attention to his horse-trade again, in order to shake his finger at the crowd and shout. "Order, order, gentlemen!" But Squire Punchard settled himself back in his chair with a complacent air, as if he had effected a practicable breach in the enemy's rampart. If others couldn't see precisely whether he had be-fooled himself or the witness most, he looked as if he had established a point, if ever so small, on which to<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6274-00000124"/> build an hypothesis, that, if it enlightened nobody, might puzzle, which would do just as well. The remaining witnesses of the plaintiff were then disposed of to about the same purpose, and as many more called up for the defendant.</p> 
               <p>These all deposed that they knew the disputed animal well; that he belonged, as they believed, to Aiken; that he had both ears slit, whether by the thorns or a jackknife they couldn't say; and that he was marked in red paint with what they took for an A, although it was much defaced by weather and rubbing.</p> 
               <p>Squire Preston then badgered and bothered them to his own satisfaction and their great annoyance, till there was hardly more left of the ram than a shadowy myth; and in regard to the mark upon him, the result, as near as could be stated, was that it was either an A or a V, if it was not something else.</p> 
               <p>After elaborate arguments on both sides, in which both advocates showed conclusively that their own witnesses knew all about the matter, and those opposed nothing at all; that the ram was marked either with an A or a V, upside down or otherwise, or some other letter or symbol unknown; that he was the undoubted property of Vail, except that he unquestionably belonged to Aiken, the case was left with the referees.</p> 
               <p>The room was cleared, the audience, lawyers, witnesses, constable, and all scattering themselves around, to traffic, chat, and smoke, and especially to sit in long rows on adjacent sticks of timber, till they could hear the conclusion of this long-disputed case.</p> 
               <p>Butler sat for a moment ruefully eying his minutes of the evidence, with the piles of like rubbish that had accumulated in previous trials; then, turning to his right-hand associate, asked, laughing,-</p> 
               <p>"Well, sir, what do you think of this lucid and perspicuous affair?"</p> 
               <p>"I think? I don't mean to think any more about it. As to whose or what that ram was, bless me if I know!"</p> 
               <p>"And you?" said Butler, turning to the other side.</p> 
               <p>"I don't think his own mother would ever know him now."</p> 
               <p>"I certainly must say, for my part, that he is utterly incomprehensible to me," replied Butler. "But he should have been born with a golden fleece to pay his way. The only fact I can come at is that here are two foolish men who have nearly ruined themselves, and are bent on doing it altogether, in a quarrel perfectly interminable; and I think it is our duty to put a stop to it. No human being can ever come at any reasonable conclusion from these papers; and I propose that we burn them up, and set the thing at rest."</p> 
               <p>Butler's coadjutors stared, at first, at this novel and summary way of settling a lawsuit. "But have we any right to do it?" asked one.</p> 
               <p>"Right? no, not legally. It is only our duty as Christian men, and that's right enough. As for the pecuniary responsibility, I will take that upon myself, if you, gentlemen, will support me by your concurrence."</p> 
               <p>The matter was soon agreed upon; and the two huge bundles of documents were placed in separate corners of the fire-place, with a lighted match under each, and speedily reduced to black heaps of cinders. The expectant crowd were then notified that they<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6274-00000125"/> might be admitted, and came pouring in all agape to know what decision had been made of this knotty controversy. The two lawyers, with looks of impatient curiosity, resumed their chairs, and their clients sat down by them, absorbed in anxious eagerness.</p> 
               <p>Squire Preston threw a wondering glance over the bared table, and hazarded a question:-</p> 
               <p>"Have you made your decision, Mr. Chairman?"</p> 
               <p>"We have settled the matter, I hope," replied Butler, with a meaning smile. "We have been utterly unable," continued he, addressing the expectant principals, "to determine to which of you this animal belonged, if, indeed, he belonged to either. All we can do is to return each of you his papers, with our earnest advice to let the matter rest here. Vail, those on the right hand of the fire-place are yours,-and those on the left are yours, Aiken. We have put them in better order for you than they have been for many a day, as we hope you will be satisfied upon reflection."</p> 
               <p>All present turned and stared a moment at the sacrificial hearth. As the idea made its way into their heads, the spectators burst into a tumultuous roar of merriment, and with laugh and joke rushed down into the street to inform the outside public how this Gordian knot had been cut at last.</p> 
               <p>The lawyers, with their clients, were left alone with the referees. Squire Preston glanced with a comical air of mingled approbation and remonstrance from the heaps of cinders to the bold innovators upon the rules of practice; Squire Punchard looked decidedly glum. But just then a cheer was heard under the windows: "Hurra for Judge Butler!" Preston's jolly face relaxed, at the sound, into a broad grin; and he drove his elbow vigorously into the face of his client, who was twitching at his coat-sleeve, with an admonitory "Keep still, you fool!" and said to Butler,-</p> 
               <p>"Well, Judge, if we take any exceptions, I suppose it will be a contempt of court. So I submit. What do you say, Brother Punchard?"</p> 
               <p>Brother Punchard had by this time softened down to a state of calmer appreciation of the position, and, first scowling down his still belligerent client, as his antagonist had been obliged to do with his constituent, replied with a hearty laugh,-</p> 
               <p>"As the Court has been seen fit to issue a write of fiery facias, I don't see that there is anything to be said."</p> 
               <p>"Then, Vail and Aiken," said Butler, "you just shake hands with each other, and settle this quarrel forever; and I'll give you each two sheep out of my own flock, and you may come and pick them out when you please."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head> 
               <p>NOTHING further occurred during the autumn of much import to the inhabitants of Merrifield. When winter brought more leisure with it, Shirk followed out eagerly the plan proposed by Butler, and proved an assiduous scholar. The ardent desire that he felt to improve himself, was strengthened by the wish to please his instructor. He almost worshipped Butler, and was prouder of being his favored pupil than he would have been to be prime minister to a king. Sam, indeed, was fairly inspired, as a melodious Campanian herdsman might have been, had the god Pan presented him with his own divine pipes, and taught him his own supernal harmonies.</p> 
               <p>Butler's new house was nearly finished; and although he had determined to keep the household in their old quarters for the winter, he had furnished one room, which was intended for his own private use. It was there that he and Shirk generally spent their winter afternoons. The comfortable arm-chairs, handsome carpet, shelves of books, walls hung with a few choice engravings, the mantel clock, and other wonders brought from the metropolis, made this apartment fairy-land to Sam. It also suited Watch very well, who, in consideration of his old age, was allowed to stretch himself upon the rug before the fire when he pleased; where he generally assisted with grave decorum at the studies or conversations of his biped friends.</p> 
               <p>One afternoon, after two or three hours of study, Butler laid down his book, drew his chair to the fire, lighted a cigar, and said to his pupil: "Come, Sam, we have done pretty well to-day. Turn round to the fire, and take a cigar, or light your pipe, if you prefer. I feel chatty."</p> 
               <p>Shirk readily complied with the proposition; and, when everything was comfortably arranged, his young patron went on:-</p> 
               <p>"You have done admirably so far, Sam. You can now read and write tolerably, and you understand and enjoy the books I lend you. But I observe you don't speak much more accurately than you used to."</p> 
               <p>"I know it, and I've worried about it myself. But somehow the English in the books seems to be a different language from what I've talked all my life. The folks at home, and most of 'em round the village, talk just as I do; and it comes hard to me to do any different, even when I know better. Besides, if I undertake to talk as you do, most folks would think I was gettin' consated, and thought I know'd more than they do, and I shouldn't like that. It would be a sort of mean."</p> 
               <p>"I can understand that, and it's not altogether wrong. Still I should advise you to try to correct your inaccuracies gradually. Talk as simply as you please, but talk good grammar. We must always try to say and do what we know is right and proper. There is no danger of doing too well in this world."</p> 
               <p>"No, sir, that there an't. I begin to see now what you meant when you told me I might study a hundred years, and yet have plenty to learn."</p> 
               <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6274-00000127"/> 
               <p>Butler smiled, but made no reply, and, lapsing into a thoughtful mood, sat looking silently into the fire. His pupil, respecting his evident abstraction, also occupied himself with his own thoughts for a while. But, after a long silence, he arose, shook out the ashes of his pipe upon the hearth, and presently sat down again. But he fidgeted in his chair, evidently nervous and restless. At length he looked up, and said in a timid tone: "Mr. James,"-</p> 
               <p>Butler's attention was instantly aroused; for he knew that some unusually imposing idea was exercising Sam's mind, when he resumes his old ceremonious style of address. He turned his head directly towards his companions; but only replied with "Well."</p> 
               <p>"I went up country a piece, yesterday," resumed Sam, with a still embarrassed manner. "I hope you won't be angry;" and then stopped short again.</p> 
               <p>"Angry!" repeated Butler with surprise; "What should I have to do with it, Sam?"</p> 
               <p>"O sir! promise me not to be angry with me! I don't know what I should do if you were; but I stopped at Mr. Wilmot's."</p> 
               <p>"Well, what of that?" replied Butler, with assumed indifference, but evident curiosity and interest.</p> 
               <p>"O James, don't think I'm impertinent. I don't know as I had any right to meddle; but I can't help seeing. I know'd you and Miss Mary when you used to play together; and I know'd you liked each other. I always thought you was born to. But somehow a sort of a cloud like's come between you; and it's been a worryin' me to death. It's a shame. You an't angry, are you?" he asked, looking in a half-frightened, beseeching manner into his friend's now animated face.</p> 
                
               <p>"No, Sam. I know, whatever you've done, that you meant well. Now tell me what you've been about, and just as it was too."</p> 
               <p>Sam proceeded with his story, with a bright look of encouragement.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I made an errand to Mr. Wilmot's, as if I was hungry; though I had plenty in my pocket, and had killed a deer besides. I cut off a hind-quarter, and carried it to Mrs. Wilmot, and asked her for some dinner. They'd all done, for 'twas after one o'clock; but Miss Mary, she sot the table and fixed me some dinner. Her mother went off about somethin', and Mary sot and talked with me, like a lady as she is, every inch of her. I made believes eat, but I couldn't 'a made a real meal, if I'd know'd I shouldn't see anything more for a year, for I was chock-full of something else. So, after a while, says I, 'Miss Mary, they do say you are goin' to live as Kennebec.' She turned all red and then white agin; and says she, in a pitiful but sharp kind o' way, 'People say a great many things they know nothing about, Sam.' O, I wish you'd a been there! for, as soon as I heerd her, I know'd right off the story about that eternal young minister was all in your eye. So I went on, and says I, 'I'm glad 'tan't true, Miss Mary. I should be sorry you went away from Merrifield; it's goin' to be somethin' of a place now. Mr. Butler's come back, and says he means to live there, and has built him a new house;' and then I stopped a minute to see what she'd say. But she turned pale as death, and only squeezed out 'yes,' so faint-like I could hardly hear it. Then I went on, and told her all you and your mother'd been doin' for me, and how you let me come here every day and study with you, and all about it. She<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6274-00000128"/> never said a word, but sot swallerin' down her heart all the time, till at last she burst out a cryin' and run out of the room. I wanted to cry too then, though I never was so glad in my life. Well, I sot awhile, but she didn't come back; so I thought I'd be off, and took my rifle and started. But, jest as I got to the door, she came out of t'other room; and says she, 'Are you going, Sam? I hope you've had dinner enough.' 'Plenty,' says I, 'thank you;' and made to open the outer door. But she grabbed my hand, and says she, all pale and cryin' agin, 'O Mr. Shirk! don't tell anybody you saw me cryin'. I should feel ashamed of myself.' I bid her good-by, and promised I wouldn't. And I've told a darned lie, and I'll tell a thousand sooner than you shouldn't know all about it."</p> 
               <p>Sam, who had not dared to look Butler in the face while he was talking, now looked up, and as he saw the warm flush that covered James's features, and the joyous expression of his eye, felt at ease once more.</p> 
               <p>"I'll forgive you for the lie, Sam; and perhaps Mary will by and by."</p> 
               <p>"I'll bet she will!" and, tossing his cap up to the ceiling and catching it as it fell, he rushed out of the room, shouting, "Hurra, hurra! It's all right, I know'd it was."</p> 
               <p>But Butler called him back, and said, with a sly smile: "Sam, I can't forgive your falsehood, except on one condition. You must not tell a word of this to anybody else,-mind, not a word to anybody."</p> 
               <p>"Mayn't I tell Jenny?" said Sam, pleadingly. "Thunder! I shall burst if I can't tell nobody."</p> 
               <p>"Not a souls, Sam. If you do, I'll never forgive you."</p> 
                
               <p>"O Lord! well, I won't tell a soul, and I'll tell no lie this time," and off he went, singing and whistling like mad.</p> 
               <p>After his departure Butler sat himself down before the fire, and went over the whole recital, over and over again. It seemed to be plain enough, though he almost feared to believe it. "Now see," thought he, "what a little common sense and plain dealing might have done! This honest fellow has come straight at the truth, while I have been sitting in the dark, quarreling with goblins of my own creation. But I will be a fool no longer. I'll know all about it to-morrow." Thus he sat with his heart full of happy hopes and bright schemes for the future, crossed, occasionally by slight misgivings lest, after all, there might be some mistake, until Betsey came in to summon him to tea.</p> 
               <p>"James," said his mother, at the tea-table, "what was the matter with Sam this afternoon? He came in and left a quarter of a deer that he said he killed up in the woods yesterday; and he seemed to be bewitched. He talked so queer that I was afraid he had been drinking."</p> 
               <p>"O no, mother, Sam's sober as a judge. But what did he say?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't know, I declare. He didn't say anything that I can remember. But he seemed chock-full of something."</p> 
               <p>"Sam's all right. He came in to me from here; and he said nothing that you would find fault with, I'm sure."</p> 
               <p>"Well, you're acting just like him, James. What makes you look so sly? You and he are getting up some prank. You're in a regular tantrum, James."</p> 
               <p>"In a tantrum, mother! and I to be a deacon one<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6274-00000129"/> of these days! If Sam and I play any prank, it will not be anything that will vex you, I assure you, mother."</p> 
               <p>"Well, you young men are wild creatures."</p> 
               <p>"O no, only on suitable occasions," replied Butler, laughing. "We can be very exemplary at times, as I hope to convince you before long."</p> 
               <p>"I don't find any fault with you, my son; but you love to puzzle me sometimes."</p> 
               <p>"I am more bent on unriddling a puzzle just now, dear mother, than on getting up one. If I make any pleasant discoveries, be sure you shall know them."</p> 
               <p>The next morning, after breakfast, James ordered his horse and rode off, saying to his mother that he might not be back till evening. She asked no questions, though she saw something was in the wind. But neither her perspicacity nor energy sufficed to furnish even a probable guess; so she sat down to her needle-work in that patient wonderment that filled up so much of her existence.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile, James urged his good horse over the rough, snowy road towards Mr. Wilmot's. The difficulties of the way consumed two hours of impatient struggle, before he reined him up, sweating and panting, before the door. Mr. Wilmot shook his hand cordially, and, calling his man to take the animal to the stable, conducted him into the house.</p> 
               <p>"Well, James," said Mrs. Wilmot, "this is the first visit you have paid us for some months. But I am very glad to see you, notwithstanding."</p> 
               <p>Butler reciprocated the welcome, and pleaded rather awkwardly the numerous calls, upon his time, ending by a glance towards Mary, who, unable to escape from the room from the suddenness of his arrival, had sunk pale and trembling into a chair by the window, where she attempted to seem busy with her work. At James's look she arose, and, with a faint smile, extended her hand; but though her lips moved, she did not articulate a word. James, glancing searchingly into her face for an instant, pressed the offered hand, and said, in a voice to be heard by her alone, "Are you glad to see me too, after so long a time?" A struggling tear was the only answer, and she extricated her hand from his, and rushed out of the room. Her departure was unnoticed amid the vociferous attentions of the children, which Butler good-naturedly encouraged, in spite of their mother's remonstrances, until he dispersed the young guerrillas in happy quietude, by the help of some packages of sugar-plums from his pockets.</p> 
               <p>After the interchange of numerous friendly inquiries and replies, Mr. Wilmot excused himself, to attend to his out-door concerns, saying, as he went out, "You must stay to dinner, James, at least; I have much to say to you." His wife too, remarking the absence of her daughter for the first time, made her apologies.</p> 
               <p>"I must go and see that you get a decent dinner. Mary must have gone into the kitchen on the same errand. I will send her to entertain you meanwhile." But James had kept a better reckoning of Mary's whereabouts. He went to the outer door, and calling to him her little sister, said to her, nodding his head towards the door of the opposite room, "Go ask Mary if she will take a short walk with me, Sue." After a few minutes, Mary, joined him, with her furred cloak upon her shoulders, and her hood drawn close over her face. They walked a short distance in silence, when Butler, gently arresting her steps, turned to his companion.</p> 
               <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6274-00000130"/> 
               <p>"Mary, have I been acting like a fool? have you promised to be the wife of any one?"</p> 
               <p>"No," she faintly murmured, and, if she intended to say more, it was drowned in a burst of tears.</p> 
               <p>"And, if I ask you to be mine, will you say no?"</p> 
               <p>A pair of happy blue eyes shone out, for an instant, through the dropping tears, and a low voice replied, "O James!"</p> 
               <p>The answer certainly was not very explicit; but Butler seemed to understand it perfectly, for he gathered her to his bosom, where all ambiguity was explained in a language intelligible wherever love is. They hid themselves and their happiness deeper yet in the little glade of firs, within the edge of which they were standing; and there, seated on a fallen log, with the bright March sun showering its warmth around, and the soft south wind whispering its benison among the spiry tops above them, they spent in sweet retrospection and sweeter anticipations one of those hours as rare, alas, as they are blest. For inexorable time is always scowling grudgingly at the bright things of earth, that only lack immortality to make it heaven. A bell, rungs at the door of the cottage, summoned them from their peculiar paradise; and closing the fond colloquy in the same delicious language in which it was began, they rejoined their friends at the dinner-table.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Wilmot looked up at the young people as they entered; and read, instantly, in the daughter's eyes, what had been the employment of their absence. She smiled softly in return to Mary's hurried glance, and said nothing. But her father, with masculine directness, called out from the head of the table, "Well Mary girl, have you and James been strolling in the woods, as you used to do years ago? You haven't looked so rosy and like yourself since you came home. I hope you have earned a good appetite." Mary did not stop to answer her father, but rushed away, blushing, to take off her cloak and hood; and it was some time before she returned, composed, but radiant with quiet happiness.</p> 
               <p>An hour passed after dinner in varied chat, when James declared, in spite of earnest solicitation, that he must start for home. While the children ran off with their father to see the noble bay bridles and saddled, Mrs. Wilmot discreetly left the lovers alone again for some moments.</p> 
               <p>"Now, dear Mary," said James, "there will be no more clouds between us and happiness. I shall not be able to see you again for a week or more, I am afraid; but I will come up as soon as I can, and mother will want you to go back with me, and finish the visit you began last August."</p> 
               <p>"O James, never speak of that wretched time again!"</p> 
               <p>The arrival of the horse, with Mary's eldest brother, perched as grand as a field-marshal upon the saddle, and quarreling with his father's careful supervision, interrupted them once more. What was left unsaid, was necessarily compressed into a single word of that mysterious tongue to which we have already alluded; and James rode light-hearted homeward.</p> 
               <p>"Now, mother," said he, as he sat down to the tea-table, which he found awaiting his arrival, "I have a puzzle for you that will please you. Mary Wilmot is not engaged to the Kennebec minister; but she is engaged nevertheless."</p> 
               <p>The good lady, we know, was no dipus; and she stared at her son, as if all the sphinxes of antiquity stood between them on the tea-table.</p> 
               <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6274-00000131"/> 
               <p>"Mary Wilmot is not engaged to her cousin, and yet she is engaged to him! how can that be, my son?"</p> 
               <p>"I didn't say precisely that, mother. She is not engaged to him, but she is engaged to-guess, mother! Well, to me."</p> 
               <p>His mother looked, for a minute, as if one of the imaginary sphinxes threatened to swallow her; then she toddled round to her son, and fell upon his neck, sobbing with surprise and joy. When the unusual emotion allowed her to speak, she asked with wonted simplicity,-</p> 
               <p>"How <emph>did</emph> you find out all that, James?"</p> 
               <p>"She told me herself, mother. So you may depend upon it, it's all correct.'</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head> 
               <p>UNDER Butler's judicious and kindly supervision, time had passed away profitably for Sam Shirk, notwithstanding Deacon Hardy's sinister predictions. His barn was full, his cellar was full, and his head was full of new ideas and new hopes. When winter had brought a cessation of farming processes, the labor of his coadjutor was quite sufficient to provide for all the necessary wants of the household.</p> 
               <p>McKim was one of those plodding bodies that lived only to travel a daily round, out of which, he had no tastes or inclinations to gratify. To work when he had anything to do, and to do nothing when the work was finished, completed the narrow sphere of his existence. He was one of those human machines that drudge on unflinchingly while the stream is let on, but when work hours are over, and the fires put out for the day, subside in an instant into an inert and motionless quiet.</p> 
               <p>His junior partner was just the reverse of all this. He would not work, if he could conscientiously help it; and the moment he could reasonably leave off, he was full of a thousand schemes wherewith to relieve the monotony of his compulsory industry. The result of their different temperaments was an admirable harmony of movement in the internal economy of their joint concerns. Sam would patiently drudge along<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6274-00000132"/> with his father-in-law, while matters imperiously required exertion, allowing him, we must acknowledge, as large a share of the common toil as he was inclined to assume. When the hour of leisure arrived, the old man sat himself down with his pipe, in the chimney-corner or on a log out of the doors, ready to bring wood and water or meet any other trifling emergency that might occur; while Sam directly sought relaxation, by what he termed "getting up some kind of a slant," or, if any very piquant amusement was on hand, "a regular time."</p> 
               <p>The forest being the usual scene of Shirk's recreation, his play was hardly less profitable than his senior's more systematic motions. Seldom was the larder without a fat partridge or a jolly hunch of venison, whenever Sam could find time to get a stroll in the woods. In his idle days such employment had been habitual to him; for, in his laziest mood, he never regarded a tramp of forty or fifty miles for his own pleasure as a hardship, through an hour's work upon, compulsion might have gone against his grain. Moreover, Sam was a perfect sportsman. He knew, as well as any man, where to find his game, and how to catch it. The bodily labor undergone in sporting, to men of such a stamp, is a very different thing from patient and continuous industry. Indeed, they seem to hate the one very much in proportion as they love the other. So, one fine morning in early March, Shirk took down his rifle from the pegs over the chimney, and, with a supply of provisions and ammunition, started off "a hunting." The newly risen sun shone brightly on the snow, and the vapors hung in light fleecy clouds over the distant ocean, as it sent up its caloric in fog into the colder atmosphere. All around the horizon else was clear as crystal; and the air was sharp and bracing. Sam strode vigorously along, singing as he went, in pleasure at his emancipation from bondage. In less than three hours he had crossed the "barrens," where for miles the land lay devoid of any but the most stinted vegetation, and struck into the edge of the forest that still stretches, almost unbroken, to the St. Lawrence.</p> 
               <p>He had not proceeded far from this point when he perceived another pedestrian travelling in the same direction along the winding track, whom he soon recognized as James Butler. The latter stopped at Sam's hail, and stood leaning upon his rifle till he came up. Shirk paused, before he spoke, to cast a glance of friendly admiration upon Butler. Few men exhibited a fairer picture of manly power and beauty. Tall and slender, but muscular and well developed, his thick frock, lined with otter-skins, displayed to advantage his firm and graceful figure. His fur cap was thrown back from his high forehead; and his dark waving hair, fresh brown cheek, and hazel eye bright with youthful buoyancy, his clearly cut mouth, whose well-defined and slightly compressed lips expressed both energy and pride, and an aquiline nose with full nostrils breathing of high spirit and daring, composed a mien at once attractive and imposing. While Sam gazed in simple satisfaction at the handsome youth, James responded:-</p> 
               <p>"You here, Sam? going to scare the deer round old Humpback, hey?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I don't know but I might before I get back to the Falls. I've been a haulin' up next summer's wood this three weeks back; and now I'm bound to have a little sport. It does me good to see you in the<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6274-00000133"/> woods again, James. What sport we had with them wolves last fall, didn't we? When you was a boy,-and you an't much more yet in p'int of age,-you used to love to go out with me now and then."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed I did, Sam. And I feel right pleased to get back among the trees again. I feel more at home here yet than in the towns on the Bay."</p> 
               <p>"That's right, by jingo! Those folks in the towns do nothing but drudge behind counters, and sick likes, all day long. I'd as lief be in jail, and done with it, myself. But I guess you're travelling up this way for more than runs in the woods. You're bound for Mr. Wilmot's, I rather concluded."</p> 
               <p>A frank laugh admitted the sunrise to be true; and James, who had not divulged to any but his mother his late visit to Mr. Wilmot's, now told his errand, without reserve, to his unceremonious but respectful companion.</p> 
               <p>"Well, that's all right. I was sure it would be. I want to see you and Miss Mary married. It's a handy thing to have a good wife. There's Jenny, saves me a world of trouble, and keeps me as snug as a fox in a woodchuck's hole. Jest look at those mittins. I didn't use to have such mittins as them."</p> 
               <p>"No, Sam, your worldly affairs have improved decidedly; and I'm glad you feel the advantage."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it's a sight better, and I hope to improve yet. Your ma'am's been the making of me; and I shall try to do something,-to please her, if nothing else. But that Jem Sharpe, he plagues me some ever since that pig scrape. Did I ever tell you about the pig?"</p> 
               <p>"No, but my mother has," replied James, laughing.</p> 
               <p>"O, the old lady did? and she made it pretty hard again me, I don't doubt. Never mind, she's a right to; but I shouldn't like to hear anybody else say much about it. But Jem makes me all the trouble he can; and I take care that sha'n't be much. He hurts himself most, pretty generally. His works always put me in mind of a story I've heard of a Paddy that went out a gunning one day, and got sight of a red squrril. So he chucks in five or six fingers of powder with a handful of shot on top on't, and blazes away at the squrril, that was crackin' nuts on a log. Bang, bang! went the gun, and run away went Paddy, heels over head, almost stunded to death. Away went the crittur too, chippin,' chippin' along the logs a piece, and then turns round to see who's comin'. So Paddy he picked himself up, and looked at him a spell; and when he got a little to rights, he begun to think as how he'd come out at the little end of the horn. So says he, 'Ah, the devil take ye, ye good-for-nothing varmint! If you'd been at my eend of the gun, ye'd never gone off with your bothered chickery, chickery, chirree." So I think it commonly is with Jim. He won't make much out of me; I an't at all consarned. It's vexatious, for all that."</p> 
               <p>"That's a pretty good story, Sam, and a good moral. But what's that? Don't I hear a moose bleating?"</p> 
               <p>"That's what it is, certain sure. Hold on a bit."</p> 
               <p>Sam put his fingers to his mouth, and produced a perfect imitation of the strange sound, betwixt a bellow and a bleat, that had attracted their attention.</p> 
               <p>"Well done. Now, if he'll answer you, we'll soon beat him up."</p> 
               <p>They listened a moment, and the strange sound was heard again.</p> 
               <p>"He's about half a mile off," said Shirk. "Most<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6274-00000134"/> likely there's a yard on 'em about here; for they can't travel far with this crust. It an't hard enough to bear them, through it will hold up you and me. The snow is jest right for a moose-hunt. It's lucky we left the road out yonder to cut across here."</p> 
               <p>"They are to windward," replied Butler;" and if we move carefully, we shall soon find out."</p> 
               <p>"Look away yonder, down the swale at that thick cedar swamp. It's about the direction of the call; and if there's a yard of them, they will be there, I think."</p> 
               <p>"I think so too. Let's go that way. I'll keep up the talk with him."</p> 
               <p>The sportsmen moved steadily towards the spot designated. Now and then Shirk repeated his call, which was answered with due courtesy by their game; and it became more and more certain that the responses came from the swamp Butler had pointed out. Having nearly reached the sport, they halted in a thick clump, and listened carefully.</p> 
               <p>"If it was a single one, he would have moved before now," whispered Butler. "The sound comes always from the same spot. It must be a yard, and the chap does not like to come out. Look to your priming, Sam, and then we'll creep on till we can see something. We don't need any spectacles to see a moose."</p> 
               <p>They now proceeded cautiously forward, dodging from cover to cover, till Sam, who was slightly in advance, halted and signed to Butler to come up where he stood, behind a huge pine.</p> 
               <p>"There they are!" whispered he.</p> 
               <p>The horns of one of the stately animals, though not yet full-grown,-for the moose, like other deer, sheds his horns annually about the month of November,- could be seen above a thickest of low birches in their front. They soon saw that a number of them were moving about in the same neighborhood. The large head and heavy muzzle of a male were perfectly visible through an opening among the bushes; and Shirk levelled his gun and fired. The head of the animal disappearing at the report, he rushed through the copse-wood, exulting in his supposed success. Butler followed him directly, hoping to obtain a short at another before the heard had dispersed; but, as he emerged from the thicket, his attention was occupied in an unexpected manner. The moose was standing at bay in one of the paths trodden out by the herd, the blood dropping from a flesh-wound through the neck, with his eye flashing and his forefoot pawing the ground. Rage and pain had converted the inoffensive and timid creature into a furious belligerent. As he saw Butler come up, he dropped his head, made a dash at Shirk, and, taking him up a fairly on his horns, started off at full speed. Astonished and alarmed, Butler paused a moment in perplexity.</p> 
               <p>"Shirk must be fatally bruised and crippled among the trees, if that furious beast does not gore or trample him to death," thought he. "I must try a nice shot and Heaven help my aim this time!."</p> 
               <p>James then dropped upon his knee and took a careful aim along the barrel of his rifle. The moose had already attained a distance of more than a hundred yards. Still Butler hesitated to pull the trigger. Although his heavy burden did not seem to diminish the speed of the animal in the least, it compelled him to carry his head horizontally, instead of thrown upward and back, as is their wont. The body of Sam and the head and body of the deer offered, therefore,<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6274-00000135"/> one straight line, when seen from behind. The fearful proximity of the human form to the range of his rifle appalled Butler, and his hand shook with agitation. The moose was now rushing directly for a close and heavy growth of large trees, among which it was apparent that a person in Sam's situation must be almost immediately maimed, if not destroyed by a hideous and painful death.</p> 
               <p>"Better be shot than that," said Butler to himself. "I must do my best, and trust it to Providence."</p> 
               <p>Steadying himself by a severe effort, he took a quick at careful aim, and fired. His ball struck precisely as he wished, under the fore shoulder of the moose, and brought him to the ground. Sam was pitched off several yards in the fall, while the deer lay disabled and helpless.</p> 
               <p>James hardly dared look through the smoke to see the effect of his shot; but as he perceived the fortunate result, "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "I have done it." Before he could rise and get fairly on his way, he was relieved from all anxiety, by seeing Sam upon his feet and approaching his fallen enemy from the other side. When Butler came up, Sam had cut the animal's throat, and then, at his leisure shaking his fist at his huge head, apostrophized him in the following speech:-</p> 
               <p>"You bloody scamp you, who told you I wanted a ride, free gratis, for nothing?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, Sam, I think you have no reason to complain. You've got no harm but a fright; and this poor beast is paying dearly enough for that."</p> 
               <p>"No, I won't grumble. But if it wa'n't for that handsome shot of yours, I might have been pounded into a jelly or torn into shoe-strings by this time."</p> 
                
               <p>"What sort of a cradle did the old fellow's horns make, Sam?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, not so awful bad. It would have been worse if they had been full-grown. A pillow or two would have improved it, anyhow. And just look at my frock; it is torn clean in halves. Blast him! he scooped me up just as a boy takes up a lump of sugar in a spoon. I wonder what Jenny will say about that coat; it's bran new, and an all-fired good one."</p> 
               <p>"I guess Jenny'll say you don't know how to keep out of mischief. You were careless, Sam. A moose isn't to be played with very safely, when his temper is up. I think, that for an old hunter, you were very stupid to stand gaping at one with an empty gun, and not a tree near you to dodge behind."</p> 
               <p>"Well, it rather looks like it. I must own up, I suppose. But what's to be done with my horned horse here?"</p> 
               <p>"I think we must leave him, and get Mr. Wilmot to send out a hand-sled and bring him there. It's but a few miles off."</p> 
               <p>"Can't do better. He's too heavy for us to manage, altogether. Let them take what they want; and if we can get a chance to send part of him down to-morrow, we can do it."</p> 
               <p>"Let us examine a little Sam, before we start. I've a notion of looking in on this drove again, a day or two hence. There's a large herd of them. See their paths! they are trodden as hard as the highway. They make a great circuit too."</p> 
               <p>"That's so. And they're safe enough while the snow is deep, and there's a good three foot of it here in the woods yet. They wont stir, at least while this crust lasts. It would cut their shins up as bad as a<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6274-00000136"/> knife. They can't travel in it far. Bob Riley went out yesterday afore breakfast, and found a yard of deer about two miles from his house, with thirteen in it. He cut the throats of the whole lot with his pocketknife, just as if they'd been sheep in a barn-yard. They jumped out into the deep snow, one after another, as he came up to'em, and went down through up to their bellies, so that they couldn't lift a leg through the crust, no more than if they'd been planted in the ground."</p> 
               <p>"That's too much like butchering, Sam. I like to give everything a chance. Let a deer have his legs and his horns against our arms and rifles, and it seems something like fair play. I don't know that the difference is really much; but I wouldn't murder them in cold blood, when they could neither run nor fight."</p> 
               <p>The two now inspected the spot around them, and soon satisfied themselves that their conjectures were correct. They found a large space of forest intersected with paths in all directions, beaten hard by the constant passage of the animals. The boughs of the young trees were nibbled off everywhere within reach, the yard having probably been occupied by them ever since the snow had accumulated to a depth sufficient to render moving about laborious. According to the habit of their species, they had remained together within the space comprehended by the labyrinth of tracks which they had made and kept open, in their daily search for the small twigs of the trees and bushes upon which they subsist when the surface of the ground is buried under its wintry covering. The extent, number, and hardness of the beats, with the damage inflicted by their browsing upon the spray of the smaller growth, proved the herd to be numerous. Having noted the situation and character of the ground sufficiently to guide any future operations, the travellers turned to regain their road.</p> 
               <p>It was not long before they reached the point where Butler's destination led him into a directions divergent from that of his companion; and they halted for a moment to take leave of each other.</p> 
               <p>"Here's the path to Mr. Wilmot's," said Shirk. "Now good luck to you, James. Miss Mary's a nice girl; she an't like some of 'em, not got wit enough to last 'em over night; and she's none too good for James Butler neither. I'll just look round old Humpback, and I guess I'll be along time enough to go down with you to-morrow, for I don't mean to camp a great ways out. What time will you be starting for the Falls?"</p> 
               <p>"Bright and early, I think. It's a long walk, you know, for a woman, and we can't ride. A horse couldn't get along at all. So be about here early in the forenoon, and we shall probably meet."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I'll make my calculations according. I should like to keep you and Mary company down. So good-day."</p> 
               <p>Less than an hour's walk brought Butler to the homestead of Mary Wilmot's father. A field had been felled and cleared in the bosom of the dense forest, and now stood, like a solitary square upon a huge checker-board, surrounded by its walls of lofty trees, in strong relief from the rest of the landscape. Sparkling with the rays of the winter sun gleaming upon its snowy surface, as one emerged into the opening and glanced around at the deep, shadowy border that encompassed it everywhere, it seemed like stepping out of one world into another. And so indeed it was. One foot of the traveller rested within the undisturbed<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6274-00000137"/> disturbed limits of Nature's empire, while the other fell upon the domain of man. Behind, lay hill and valley, brook and river, moss and stone, land and wood, as they came from the hand of the Creator; unchanged in the whole, though silent and powerful instruments were constantly displacing and renewing every part. Not a trace was to be found, in all that quiet and solemn scene, of active and apparent agency. The fallen trunk mouldered away in solitude and dim silence; and equally noiselessly and imperceptibly the sapling rose, out of its decay, into the majestic proportions of its predecessor. The brooks ran on in shadow, and the river glistened in the light that penetrated here and there to its secluded bosom, as they had one done from the birth of time: apt emblems of all around,-always the same to the sense, yet continually changing in every particle; continually passing away, and continually renewed.</p> 
               <p>Before, spread the picture of man's activity, where, upon a limited space, human toil and care had moulded the scene to their own purposes; banishing the lone and melancholy grandeur of Nature for the bustle and the changes, the shift and restlessness, of civilization. Behind, lay a world of unbroken monotony. Before, was an ant-hill, teeming with life and eager with anxious devices, with the instruments and the results of labor visible everywhere around.</p> 
               <p>With a hurried step, the youth crossed the clearing, threading his way along the path that wound among the blackened stumps that protruded from the snow.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Wilmot's dwelling was a simple log-house, though larger and more commodiously finished than the ordinary. But within it, luxury was necessarily unknown, and mere taste little regarded. In the infant stages of a settlement, it tasks the industry of the pioneer of civilization severely, for a while, to procure even the necessaries of life. The rich and poor are, in such cases, nearly on a level; for it is impossible to transport the elegancies of refinement into such situations, even where the means exist of procuring them. Hence the cradles of our towns and villages are humble and rude. But as grass lands and harvests succeed the forest and the blackened and sooty clearing, roads are formed, and cattle stray where the bear and wolf have roamed; and neat homes and well-appointed households take the place of the rough arrangements that meet the primary necessities of existence.</p> 
               <p>As her father had lately left a more cultivated region, and was abundantly able to procure for his family all that circumstances allowed, Mary Wilmot was by no means uneducated or vulgar, though her home was in the heart of the wilderness. She was modest and unpretending, and her manners simple, but refined. Above want or the need of subserviency, a native dignity was apparent through her simplicity. Natural politeness and grace were the necessary results of a good heart and mind, unchecked by any feeling of inferiority, yet devoid of the hauteur of birth and fashionable pride. Cheerful mirth beamed from her quiet blue eye; and the bright forehead that shone beneath her dark hair, the cheek where the wild rose dwelt in health and beauty, the expressive mouth and intelligent countenance, all spoke of womanly worth, sweetness, and purity, though untuned to courtly phrase and unshapen by the arbitrament of fashion. A gentle voice and a sweet smile completed in her a lovely and attractive personality.</p> 
               <p>As Butler approached the dwelling, the young girl<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6274-00000138"/> we have just sketched came out from the door of the rough building that sheltered the domestic animals of the farm, with the milk-pail in her hand; for she had never learned that to be useful was any derogation from the character of a lady. The bright apparition attracted the young man's eye immediately; and his hasty step, changing its direction, soon placed him at her side.</p> 
               <p>The long intimacy and perfect confidence now happily restablished between the lovers, perhaps divested their intercourse of something of the restless romance of a less assured attachment; but, in the eager and burning glance of the youth and the downcast but happy expression of the maiden, it was easy to read that both were wrapt in that glowing and delicious dream which youth and passion can lend to life but once,-the absorbing, all-controlling rush and concentration of feeling which, once over, can never be recalled; but is gradually softened to a more sober and worldly happiness, or doomed to sadden into disappointment and apathy. Engrossed with the joy of meeting, their hearts were their world, and for external things they had neither eye not thought.</p> 
               <p>Alas! that other and contaminated influences should always await those who pass the threshold of life, that clouds should gather in the sunny sky of the inexperienced, that trouble and anxiety should distill, drop by drop, into the cup, turning the sparkling draught into bitterness! It is a glorious but brief delusion that ushers us into the uncertain and wayward paths of manhood. Happy is he who can carry within his breast, living and warm, even a feeble glimmering of his early hopes, and bear about with him a remnant of the buoyancy and confidence of youth, to be a talisman man against disappointment and vexation, and a cordial to cheer the fainting spirit in the midst of vicissitude and woe. But the gladsome season when two young and pure hearts worship in trustful affection, being to themselves the shrine and the sweet incense,-precious, golden hours of undimmed faith, how short is your promised eternity! Fidelity and unwavering trust may, indeed, be a sure and welcome staff to our weary steps, as we advance upon our pilgrimage; but where are the roseate garlands that wreathed it,-where the Promethean fire that sparkled from the boy-god's pinions?</p> 
               <p>But few moments were allowed the lovers to indulge undisturbed the feelings that held them entranced. The guest soon attracted the attention of the younger population of the house; and they dragged the pair in among them, emulating with their boisterous welcome the loud barking with which honest Sancho hailed James's well-known face. Here Butler met a more sedate, but not less cordial reception, and was soon seated quietly by Mary's side, answering the inquiries of Mr. Wilmot respecting the far-off scenes of the metropolis, while the children stood gaping, round, as if he were returned from the Pyramids or the sources of the Nile. Railroads and steamers had not yet lent their aid to locomotion, and a journey to Boston was an event of no small moment. Huge logs were piled into the fire-place, that yawned like a cave on one side of the room; while the curiosity of the elders and the wonder of the small fry were abundantly fed by Butler's patient responses. The farmer repaid his guest by discussions of the weather, dissertations upon crops, and shrewd remarks, moral, political, and philosophical, upon the topics suggested by the conversation. Before<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6274-00000139"/> fore the family parted for the night, it was settled that Mary should accompany her lover on the morrow to the village, and that her family should, within a week or two, also come down to grace her wedding.</p> 
               <p>All laid their heads upon their pillows in content and happiness; and early morning found them assembled at the breakfast-table. The meal over, the affianced pair set out upon their walk. The distance would have been sufficiently alarming to a city miss, being not far from sixteen miles through the forests. But, with materials for a light dinner in her bag carried upon Butler's arm, the actively nurtured girl started with food as light as her heart, and fearless in her confidence in her companion; for when a pure and truly womanly nature surrenders itself into the arms of its chosen life-companionship, it is with a feeling of trustfulness and unhesitancy, not less secure and full than the deeply religious spirit finds in its reliance upon divine Providence. The strong arm upon which the maiden fondly leans her feebler frame and all her hopes, seems to her scarcely less sure than the power of Omnipotence itself.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head> 
               <p>THE sun shone clear and bright upon the tree-tops, and its rays streamed through the foliage of the evergreens and the bare trunks of the hard-wood growth, upon the even covering of snow that lay several feet deep upon the earth. The thaw had converted the surface, as we have said, into a crust capable of bearing a man's weight; so that the travellers proceeded without difficulty in all directions, over the tops of the small bushes and undergrowth that were mostly buried beneath the frozen surface. The arrow stems of the red pines, flashing back the light from their purple bark, and the dark gray white pines, still loftier and larger than the former, rose in myriad columns around them, like pillars of variegated porphyry. The thick blunt tassels of the former species, and the longer and more delicate spray of the latter, were dancing in the light breeze that played over and among their summits, while all below was calm and still. The slaty trunks of the spotted beech, the yellow birch with the golden fringes of its outer bark, the white birch shrouded in its blanched envelope, and the rough and stately maples, rose in magnificent proportions, spreading their leafless branches among the verdant canopies that clustered umbrella-like over the tall timber-trees. Occasionally a huge hemlock mingled the deep and shadowly green of its long, drooping, and feathery boughs with<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6274-00000140"/> the yellowish tints of the spruces, or the rich and glossy hues of the fir, whose foliage turned, ever and anon, its pearly reverse to the eye, like bronze lined with silver, as gusts of air swept down the deep vistas of the woods.</p> 
               <p>There is not in nature a more magnificent scene than the primitive forest. There are the stupendous heights and illimitable distances, the variety of form and color, all softened and chastened, by the depth of shade, into a picture of solemn majesty; while here and there, in each little glade, a flush of sunshine pours into the bosom of the twilight wood, forming contrasts rich and beautiful beyond description. The regular pyramids of green of the silver firs or young spruces fill the lower portion of the diorama, intermixed with the slender and drooping stalks of the underwood. Next rise the hard-wood trees, a hundred feet or more into the air; and over all, the pine-tops, spread like vast chandeliers, a tassel of living green dangling from the extremity of every twig, and seeming almost to reach the sky, which they nearly shut out from view. The whole sombre and solemn mass, penetrated and penciled, here and there, by glimpses of the upper air, makes a world of mystery and solitude that impresses and overwhelms the sense with a feelings of beauty and of awe.</p> 
               <p>The lovers walked briskly on among the aisles of the forest, too much absorbed with themselves to be very attentive to the objects around them, or to the distance passed over. The red squirrels, as they sat upon the stumps that peered in dark and mouldering ruin through the snow, enjoying the straggling beams of the sun and searching out the seeds in the cones of the resinous trees, threw down their treasures, and scudded up the nearest trunk, themselves and their saucy chirruping alike unnoticed. Even had a deer broken away from his browsing, of a stately moose or swift caribou been seen throwing his nose into the air, and pausing to take one eager gaze at the intruders, it would hardly have tempted James to use his rifle. Before the forenoon was much advanced, six or eight miles were left behind by the elastic steps of the young travellers. Before, however, they had reached the point where Butler expected to fall in with Sam, the spare and nervous figure of Shirk was seem approaching them, at the long and steady trot often used by the Indians when passing rapidly through the woods. He halted as he came up, and, wiping his forehead with his sleeve, drew a few long breaths to refresh his lungs, and spoke without the ceremony of a good-morning. "Blame the luck, that I couldn't have met you before. There's a pack o' tarnal Indians after us; and it'll be a hard job to get clear of 'em with Mary. If you and I was alone, we'd give 'em a hard time; but now we're in a bad fix. But don't be frightened, Miss Mary; that'll only make matters worse."</p> 
               <p>"Indians, Sam!" replied Butler in a tone of alarm; and "Indians!" echoed Mary faintly,-her cheek growing pale as ashes.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Indians,-Iroquois, confound 'em! But we an't got any time to throw away. We can't get back to Mr. Wilmot's, as you'll know when I tell you about it. So let's be makin' tracks! We must push for the Falls; and may be, when we get lower down, we'll fall in with somebody to help us."</p> 
               <p>Shirk then, taking the lead of the little party, proceeded at a sharp pace to the southward. Butler followed, supporting with more solicitude than ever his<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6274-00000141"/> companion, who was able, though still trembling with apprehensions, to keep up with Sam's rapid pace with the efficient and careful aid of her lover's arm. As they moved along, Sam thus proceeded in his narrative:</p> 
               <p>"You see," said he, "I was lying on a deer-path, watching for deer, when along came an Indian, and sat down within two or three rods of me. I kept snug, and, in about a quarter of an hour, four more came up, and sat down with him. I knowed by their talk and paint they was Canada Indians; for I learnt a little of their lingo from an old feller that used to keep about Merrifield a good deal. I sot a good deal by him; for he taught me to make paddles and snow-shoes, and arrows, and the like o' that. He was a master feller for such things. Well, I watched 'em, like a snake; and I soon found out that the one that came along first had been over to Mary's father's, peepin' round. I suppose he was after stealing something if he could. He'd found out you was about starting down along; so he comes to hunt up the rest and waylay you. These British Indians an't forgot the deviltry they used to carry on in the war-time yet. I don't know as they mean to do any worse than to plunder you; but, blast 'em! they mustn't have a chance, nohow. So, thinks I, here's a pretty how d'ye do! and I begun to think how I could get off and let you know time enough to turn back. Right behind me was a cedar swamp, and a steep bank leading down to it. So, you see, I started to creep off on my belly; and, as I kept the thicket atween them and me, I got fairly down and across the swamp. Then the devils saw me, and took after me. Of course I made tracks quick. They gave me a hard one for about two miles; and I thought my scalp was gone for it. But, in a long pull, a white man 'll beat an Indian; and there an't many legs, red or white, that 'll go faster or farther than mine. I'm used to trampin'. I led 'em off your track all I could, to give you time to get by 'em. So we got over onto the ridge alongside the lake, and there I gave 'em the slip; for I know'd the country best, and made down a brook, where they couldn't track me on the ice, and got back here. Now, after they quit me, I saw 'em strike off to the westward, for when they'd fairly lost my track, I went back a piece to find out their motions. They wouldn't come out far this side of Mr. Wilmot's; but when they find you've passed, they'll be after us like a streak of lightnin'."</p> 
               <p>At this exposition of Sam's, James's features showed symptoms, of his grave apprehensions for his beloved charge, though for himself, bred among such dangers, he would have been less disturbed. Mary's face was pale as death, and the compressed lip and fixed expression of the eye showed that terror had wrought a painful effect upon her mind. Yet she bore up bravely against her womanly feelings. A few moments of silence followed; for all were aware that it was an hour of extreme and pressing peril, whose suddenness benumbed by its first shock; and there seemed no refuge or chance of escape apparent, to cheer or revive their spirits. Butlers looked anxiously at Mary, and thought of the probable issue of this race, perhaps for life or death, with, dread almost unmingled with the slightest tinge of hope. A glance was exchanged between them full of contradictory and excited sentiment. The love, hope, and confidence, that a few moments before filled their young hearts to the exclusion of all doubts or apprehensions, tumultuously struggled now with<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6274-00000142"/> horrible fears. The happiness whose exulting freshness had raised them far above suspicions of mishap, was brought violently down to a startling and painful reality. But, though joy had fled, confidence and hope revived, as the first shock of surprise and dread passed away. Recovering his elasticity and coolness, James pressed Mary's hand encouragingly, though he dared not trust his voice, at the moment, to speak to her, and turned to Sam, to hold counsel as to their course.</p> 
               <p>"What shall we do, Sam?"</p> 
               <p>"Run while we can, and then fight 'em," said Shirk coolly.</p> 
               <p>"But," rejoined Butler, his countenance again clouding over in view of the cruel embarrassments of their situation, "What use to talk of running away from five Indians with Mary? She will never hold out to reach the settlement; and, if it comes to a brush, they are too many for us. O God! that she should be here. Sam, you must leave us and hurry down as quickly as you can. I will get Mary along as fast as possible, and try to hold the hounds at bay till you get back with help. But don't lose a minute; we shall be able to push as low down as Schoodic Brook, at least."</p> 
               <p>Sam pushed back his cap, and looked at Butler with a glance of astonishment, while he whistled out a long low "when" between his teeth.</p> 
               <p>"James Butler, that won't do. Come back with help! we might come back in time to bury you, to be sure. No, James, that won't do, nohow at all."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Sam, and what good can you do us? we two can't fight five; and if you can't save us, you will save yourself. So go, and we'll get along as fast as we can. I shall hide Mary somehow, if compelled, and fight it out to the last. You'll be back in season yet, with some of our friends. They won't be slow on the road, I know. Perhaps, too, you'll meet somebody not far below. One good rifle, with yours and mine, would give us a decent chance."</p> 
               <p>"It's no use saying any more, James, Butler. Come cut, come long tail, I don't quit. I should be ashamed to look anybody in the face after it. Besides, don't you feel so downcast; we'll get Mary off safe enough yet. There an't but three of 'em's got guns. You used to be a dead shot; and I an't slow with a rifle myself. If worst comes to worst, we'll give 'em a hard one. Don't be frightened, Miss Mary; but keep up your heart and push along, as well as you can, to hold out. It won't do any good to be gabbling here. We must try to throw 'em off our trail, and hide till nightfall, and then be off again. They must be some ways behind us yet. But we can't tell exactly. I'll keep an eye on the back track, and you see to Mary, James, and push on smart."</p> 
               <p>"So be it then, Sam; and I can't say but I'm glad enough of your company in this scrape, for Mary's sake. Let us hasten on and keep quiet then."</p> 
               <p>The trio now travelled on in silence at a rapid walk, Shirk bringing up the rear, whence danger was to be first apprehended. Two or three miles were thus rapidly traversed, when Sam said to his companions in a low and more cheerful tone, "I'll do it now, I guess. If we can get another half mile before they sight us, we'll cheat 'em."</p> 
               <p>He then briefly explained his plan to Butler, who assented to its prudence; and, encouraged by the whisperings of hope, the brisk pace was still quickened, till they stood within sight of a long reach of low<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6274-00000143"/> ground, overflowed by the rains and now covered with ice. "There," said Sam exultingly, "there we'll baffle 'em."</p> 
               <p>They paused upon the brow of a ridge, at the foot of whose steep declivity commenced the stretch of interval land, now converted into an unbroken frozen plain, through which rose the trunks of trees and bushes in thickets which made it impervious to the sight for any considerable distance. Butler's eye glistened with joy as he saw this labyrinth of swamps, which he well knew was of great extent, spreading out before them a road which would convey no hint of the direction of their flight to pursuers.</p> 
               <p>Sam pointed out to them the long trunk of a fallen tree, which lying down the hill-side connected with the edge of a small ravine, where a temporary torrent made its way, in the thaws and rains, down to the swamp, and which was now congealed in a series of miniature cascades and slopes, till it reached the bottom. They had for some time been treading carefully in each others' tracks, making but one impression, and that a faint one, on the hard crust, as they hoped here to mystify their enemies.</p> 
               <p>"Keep on that log and get into the run, and so down into the swamp; and don't touch any snow anywhere for your lives," said Sam.</p> 
               <p>Scarcely were the words out of his mouth when he again spoke, but in a subdued whisper: "Down, down! There's one of the devils comin.' Here, James, Let Mary creep carefully down, and you come up here. We must stop this feller's mouth."</p> 
               <p>James spoke a few words of encouragement to the poor girl, now again pale and trembling with renewed fear, and gave her some directions for her descent; then, pushing his rifle before him, crept along the trunk of the tree till he stood again by Sam's side; both being protected from observation of anyone in front by the huge circular mass of roots and earth turned up by its fall.</p> 
               <p>"I saw the rascal away yonder, just comin' along by that bend of the river that we crossed. You can see about ten feet of the ice between the trees; and I set my eyes right on him, followin' the track head down, like a hound dog. I guess he's ahead of the rest. I didn't see any more; and I've been watchin' the spot ever since. He'll be up in five or ten minutes; and we must fix him out somehow. But look here, James: best get Mary out o' this; for if we have to fire, we must run for it afterwards, or our plan is spoilt. They'll come after us like race-hordes now. Do you see the big rock down by that crooked cedar, jest ahead of Mary now?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"Well, run down to her, and carry her to that rock. Then look about nor'east, and you'll see a large yeller pine top, higher, by twenty feet, than any round it. Tell her to steer straight for that, and hide on the edge of the ice; don't let her touch the snow, on no accounts. We'll come right along to her, after this feller's taken care of. It's considerable far for her to go along, but it's the only chance. You and I must make after her, when we do start, as tight as we can scamper. If she can get there as quick as we can catch up, I guess we'll do."</p> 
               <p>James leaned his gun against the matted roots that rose like a broad shield before them, and crept again down the bank to join Mary. As they moved rapidly on towards the rock, he cautioned her to exert her utmost<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6274-00000144"/> most activity, and to brace herself to meet the emergency with the resolution that alone could extricate them. As they turned round the huge and mossy boulder, they easily distinguished the lofty tree-top mentioned by Sam, looming like a tall mast above the general level.</p> 
               <p>"Do you see that tall pine, dear Mary?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I do, James."</p> 
               <p>"Well, dearest, go straight to that tree as fast as you can. Tread only on solid ice,-don't touch a morsel of snow. When you get there, conceal yourself as well as you can; but keep always on the ice. We will soon overtake you."</p> 
               <p>"Must I go alone, then, dear James?"</p> 
               <p>"It must be so, Mary. Sam and I will hold the savages in check, till you are across the swamp. It is not more than a quarter of a mile; we shall join you soon. Come, Mary dear, cheer up, and God protect you!"</p> 
               <p>He stopped and kissed her pale cheek. She turned with a look of anguish to her lover, but replied with a firm voice. "I will go James; it will not take me long. I am accustomed to the woods, you know. But, O! come quickly; be careful, be a coward even, for my sake, James. What shall I do, if any harm happens to you?"</p> 
               <p>James threw once more, around the being so precious to him, and embrace that both felt might be the last, and murmured in her ear, "Mary dear, beloved Mary, I will be with you again in ten minutes, if it be possible. We can hear your voice, if anything happens; but they must be behind us; we shall be between you and harm. Now go, and Heaven be with you" The young lovers now parted, in mutual, anguish guish and with racking anxiety for the dangers which overhung each, and which would have been less intimidating, could they have been shared in company. To part was, to both, the loss of their best reliance, and trusting to chance and out of their own reach their dearest treasure. Leaving Butler was to poor Mary, especially, to throw away the staff that upheld her tottering steps; and as she moved away alone, terror and reluctance almost uncontrollable overwhelmed her with a flood of misery. Tears dropped fast from her eyes; but, with a whispered prayer, the noble girl walked firmly and swiftly to the designated point, and never looked once behind her.</p> 
               <p>The stouter heart of Butler was not less dejected, as he left her to traverse the forest alone, while savages were hanging round their path. Silently and briefly commending her to Providence, he turned and quietly crept up again to the cover where Sam maintained his watch, and resumed his faithful rifle.</p> 
               <p>Shirk was peeping cautiously through a small loophole formed by the intertwining roots, where the gravel and soil had fallen out from between them. As his companion rejoined him, he said to him in a whisper,-</p> 
               <p>"Can't we contrive to cut that feller's throat? If we fire, it will give a hint to the others and hurry them on; perhaps this feller is the only one on the track yet. Time is everything for Mary, you know."</p> 
               <p>"It must be done," replied Butler. "Sam, do you keep your rifle on the path; and, if another comes up before this one is disposed of, you will be obliged to shoot him. I have my hunting-knife about me, and will jump on this chap and stab him before he knows it. Don't you stir unless you see I can't master him; but watch the track, and don't let any of them get past us."</p> 
               <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6274-00000145"/> 
               <p>"Never fear, James. But be cool. Let him have it right in the throat or between the ribs, and push him over if you can. I'll give him a settler on the head, if you don't kill."</p> 
               <p>This arrangement made, the pair sat mute and motionless; Sam's eye bent through his convenient porthole and Butler keeping a sharp watch upon either side. Once he turned to the quarter where Mary was retreating; but the trees had long shut out every possibility even of a glimpse of her, and he bent his whole attention to the crisis at hand. In a few moments the Indian appeared at the foot of the ridge, his eye now bent down to keep the track, and then glancing keenly and widely round to catch any indication of life or motion. He paused a moment at the base of the hill and listened intently before ascending, reconnoitring also with sharp and distrustful looks the natural rampart that sheltered the objects of his pursuit. Not a sound was to be heard, and the native resumed his advance. His moccasined foot gave out no echo, but the vigilant Sam signified all his motions to Butler by signs. James now sat crouching on the trunk, his long hunting-knife glistening in his grasp, and his muscles gathered in for an instant bound upon his foe. As the savaged approached the wall of roots that covered the ambuscade, his habitual caution led him to edge away a pace or two, from the possible danger. The faithful sentinel, however, gave Butler intimation, by a gesture of his hand, and he summoned all his energies for the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup de main.</foreign> His eye, fixed steadily upon the point where the Indian must first appear, flashed with a stern excitement, while his cheek was pale with anxiety and a natural reluctance to the painful but necessary act. The instant the savage circled round the buttress, the youth sprang upon him, with a tremendous leap; and, although the precaution of the Indian had given him the opportunity to guard himself, in some measure, against the attack, he succeeded in burying his knife in the side of his antagonist. The sudden shock knocked from the hand of the Indian the gun which he carried; but the wound was not fatal, and Butler could not extricate the weapon before he felt himself clasped tightly in the embrace of his sinewy enemy. Shirk stood by the while, with rifle raised, ready to pour its deadly volley, if circumstances required.</p> 
               <p>The native and the youth struggled hard for a moment or two; the former to get his hands upon the scalping-knife that hung in his girdle and Butler to prevent it. James, at length, feeling the grasp of his foe growing feebler, tripped up his heels with a strenuous effort, and threw him backward upon the snow. For a short space they writhed and twisted in deadly contention; but at last Butler succeeded in planting himself immovably upon the breast of the Indian, whose strength was rapidly failing from the effects of his wound; and grasping firmly with one hand the arm, by the side of which the knife was hung, compressed his tawny throat with the other, with a strength that choked his respiration. After an ineffectual attempt to reach the knife with his left arm that was wound around Butler's body, he was compelled by faintness and exhaustion to give over his efforts. Shirk, who had been hovering round in vain to strike a blow with the butt of his gun, improved instantly the opportunity to snatch the knife from the belt, and drew with it a deadly gash across the throat that was held motionless in James's grasp. A convulsive shudder ran over the dark frame, and the limbs relaxed their fibres forever.</p> 
               <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6274-00000146"/> 
               <p>Butler sprang up unharmed from the perilous encounter, Sam quietly slipping the fatal knife into his pocket.</p> 
               <p>"It's good stuff, and I may want it agin yet. Now, James, take up the chap's gun. There an't but two more of 'em's got guns; and if they do overhaul us, with three shots all handy, I think we'll do considerable well with t'other four. It's a terrible pretty fowling-piece too, and English one. Well, that poor devil's done for. Now we must be moving, and pretty smart too. But first I'll take the chap's wampum: the women will like it."</p> 
               <p>The two friends then quitted the bloody scene of the fray; and moving carefully down the old trunk that had one them so good service, and thence to the, frost-bound rivulet, they landed safely upon the level of the swamp, without leaving any trace whatever of their passage. Having reached the solid ice, they crossed the interval at a rapid pace, and soon gained the farther shore. Here Butler clasped with delight, in his, the hand of Mary, who came to meet them from the midst of a thicket of young cedars. She heard the story of the encounter with a shudder: and James felt, with unalloyed ecstasy, the warm pressure of the hand that expressed her joy at his safety. Meanwhile they followed up a long cove, as it were, formed by the inundation of the waters, till higher land, on either side, confined again within its proper limits the course of a large brook, whose swollen current had filled the basin which they had just crossed, during the freshets of the fall and winter. Journeying on for some distance up the little stream, they came upon a sharp bend, inclosed on every side by a dense growth of alders and small trees, and overhung by huge rocks on either bank. The whole formed a little amphitheatre, where the party could be exposed to no eye from without the circle. A large windfall was stretched across the stream, at the outlet of this inclosure. The cakes of ice had driven over the trunk of the tree during the freshet, and hung suspended there, as the surface of the pond above fell with the decrease of the flood. Winter had now locked up the springs that fed the channel, and a feeble rivulet stole down the centre of the bed, leaving a dry and airy hall, carpeted with withered leaves or strewn with gravel, three or four feet under the crystal roof that spread from bank to bank. The fracture of the mass, where it lay raised at the upper end upon the fallen log, left an opening at one corner, by which an easy entrance was afforded to this snug retreat. As the ice-cakes shelved up the stream, it could not attract the attention of any one from below; the aperture being overhung as with a pent-house and winding snugly round the end of the trunk, whose bleached and battered mass seemed, to hasty observation, completely to close the hollow. The fugitives, under the guidance of Sam, crept over the edge of the ice and through the narrow door-way, down into the channel of the brook, along which they easily moved, by stooping, past a bend of the stream which intercepted entirely, by the sudden change of course, all view from the passage by which they entered. There James and Mary, scraping together the dried leaves for a rude couch, sat themselves snugly down behind the projecting point; and, with her warm cloak drawn closely round her, they reclined against the bank quite comfortably and at their ease. The cold air was shut out, and the ceiling of their hiding-place stretched<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6274-00000147"/> across just above their heads, admitting a sober and pleasant light, though fortunately not so transparent as to betray them from above. Shirk gathered up a bunch of leaves, and, returning to the entrance, sedulously effaced and covered up all traces of their passage; and, having completed his precautions at the point, behind which they were concealed, he too quietly stretched himself out, to enjoy the rest that he now began to feel acceptable to his weary limbs.</p> 
               <p>"Now you mustn't speak too loud, though they will be sharp ears to hear us through a foot of solid ice, and sharp eyes to see us too, for this is snow ice, for three inches on the top, luckily for us. If it was all like this just over our heads, you might look through it as easy as a glass window. Don't you think it's a considerable good shelter for a rainy day, Miss Mary? I noticed the place some time ago; but didn't think I should ever be so glad to get into it. I hope these critturs won't track us; but, if they do, we've got a pretty good fort, provided they don't starve us out. Lay the guns handy, James. There's three good charges for 'em, if they trouble us, for the first brush. It's hard to cheat an Indian. They're master fellers for followin' a track. They won't be likely to think we've come this way; for our course was southward. But when they miss the trail, they'll be apt to think we got away on the ice, and 'll hunt round pretty sharp. But this is a blind hole; they'll do well to find us; for who'd ever think of looking here for anything but a musquash? At any rate, I guess they'll find they've come for wool to a goat's house, if they undertake to drive us out. I've had a long run to-day; and if you'll keep a bright lookout, I'll go to sleep, James. But don't make a noise, on any account. When it's dark, we'll start agin. We'll hear something of 'em soon, if at all."</p> 
               <p>So saying, Sam wriggled himself into a comfortable position, and soon, dropped into a sound slumber. Mary and James forgot their anxieties again, and carried on, in subdued whispers, a conversation more interesting to themselves, probably, than to anybody else. No great time, however, elapsed, before these peaceful employments were suspended by a fierce yell, which echoed through the forest and came to their ears, though deadened by the solid covering of their singular retreat, with a most intimidating wildness. Mary grew pale as death, and looked tremblingly at her lover. James's open brow contracted again to a stern and harassed expression; while Shirk shook off his drowsiness, and raised himself upon an elbow to listen. It was not repeated, and all was still again as ever.</p> 
               <p>"There's the rest on 'em got along," at last spoke Sam. "They're screeching over that feller with his throat cut; and now they'll do their prettiest to return the favor. I was in hopes t'others had quit chasing us. But they're uncommon perseverin,' these Indians. If they cut my throat this time, though, I guess they'll know it."</p> 
               <p>"What's best to be done, Sam? Shall we go out and watch, or keep close?"</p> 
               <p>"Keep close, certain. They won't find us, 'tan't likely; and if they do, they'll catch a Tartar. Mind and make no noise, and let 'em swing; that's the talk."</p> 
               <p>An anxious hour or two passed by; but, ensconced in their icy fortress, they could obtain no certain indications of the movements of their enemies. Just as the dusk came on, Sam held up a warning finger, as a dim shadow glided along the surface of the ice, in their<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6274-00000148"/> immediate neighborhood. Perhaps it was one of their pursuers, scouting for some sign of the lost fugitives. It might, however, have been only a wild animal. No interruption of their quiet ensued; and night closed in, rendering their retreat utterly dark.</p> 
               <p>After a lunch upon the contents of Mary's bag, Sam and Butler groped their way cautiously to the mouth of the cavern, and, after listening intently for some minutes and catching no sound that indicated danger, emerged from their concealment, and reconnoitred the immediate vicinity. No traces of an enemy were discoverable, and they quickly returned to their companion, and with her took a final leave of the shelter that had done them so good service.</p> 
               <p>The evening was still and mild. The rustling of the pine-tops, like the surge of a distant beach, filled the atmosphere with its deep, indefinite murmurings. Ever and anon the hooting owl called to his mates, and was answered in the droll half shout, half bark, that constitutes their vocabulary. Other sound or sign of life there was none.</p> 
               <p>Shirk led the way, with a gun on each shoulder; and close behind followed Butler, with Mary leaning on his arm. They threaded rapidly and without interruption the dim paths of the forest, the reflection of the star-light from the snow affording them sufficient light, without exposing them to being seen from any distance. A few hours of exertion brought them safely to the settlement. Only here and there a light shone, at that late hour, from the friendly windows; but the sense of security and peace, which is the first blessing of civilization, relieved the painful tension of their minds, as they passed down the silent roadway; and each party gained their respective homes, wearied, but thankful.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head> 
               <p>WITH early morning, all Merrifield was in a ferment. Shirk had found time to communicate to numbers of his neighbors the events of the preceding day, and, had he not been compelled to yield to the imperative claims of fatigue and hunger, would probably have devoted himself to gossiping, on an occasion so favorable. As it was, there was no lack of information upon the subject. The story passed from lip to lip and from house to house, gaining all sorts of additions and variations as it went its round. Independently of any accessories, true or false, it was unquestionably of startling interest. Strange Indians had been seen lurking round, without doubt, with more or less mischievous purposes. Indian wars, with all their horrible circumstances of carnage and atrocity, although belonging to a time gone by, still remained fresh in the minds of frontier communities. Straggling incursions of hostile natives from the Canadas were not unlikely to be undertaken for purposes of plunder, which occasion might easily turn to conflagration and bloodshed, with such wild marauders. An unbroken forest lay between Merrifield and the St. Lawrence, and lapped the very verge of the little village in all directions. Pillage, and even murder, were too congenial to the habits of the Indians to be bridled securely by mere political conventions, in which they had no share but a<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6274-00000149"/> reluctant obedience. The barbarous allies that England enlisted-to her eternal disgrace-on her side in the Revolutionary war, remembered still the profitable and congenial license then practiced upon the exposed colonists. Feeble and remote settlements had hardly ceased to view the possibility of Indian aggression with a sensitive and ferocious apprehension. The enmity that existed between the masses of our countrymen and the Indian, where they were brought into rough contact, was deep and bitter. The white man regarded his adversary as he did a wolf, as an object alike of fear and contempt. He despised the native, even while he knew, from a sore and bloody experience, his power and will to do mischief upon opportunity. But as Indian warfare was based upon principles abhorrent to civilized antagonism, each instance of prowess gained for the savage no respect, while it did not fail to produce a furious and unrelenting hatred. With the Indian himself, the contest was one of sullen desperation. Always unable to cope with the superior advantages of his competitors, his natural disposition to covert and insidious attack was compelled into a still deeper treachery, and his bloody retributions driven by the sting of hopeless inferiority into the madness of a yet more reckless vengeance. The history of the struggle has been a melancholy and dark record of mutual hate and reciprocal injury. Philanthropy, while she weeps over the graves of the original occupants of this broad land, can hardly fail to censure severely those by whose hands their sad and utter extermination was wrought. But this censure is, in great degree, unjust. The issue was a moral and physical necessity, a destiny that must needs be accomplished. The result grew inevitably out of the mere juxtaposition of the two races upon the same soil. They could no more exist there together than the cultivated field and the primeval forest could, at one and the same time, occupy the ground. Every trait of national character, every social habit, the individual temperament of both parties, imperatively forbade it. The Anglo-Saxon could not tolerate an equal; the red man would not acknowledge his superior. The Anglo-Saxon must be master, but the Indian would not be slave. The characteristic temperament of the latter could never be moulded anew, or his moral or physical habitudes changed or even modified. The deep stamp of uncounted centuries was there, which no temporary influence could efface. The proud heart sustained, and even provoked to the end, the unequal strife, and broke in its last despair. Many instances of gross injustice and heartless cruelty no doubt took place in this furious struggle for existence; for such, on both sides, it was. There was much to mourn for and much to blush for; and where is there not? but the great issue is from the hand of Providence. One era has yielded to another and a more advanced one. The Indian disappears before civilized man, as the saurian and other antediluvian monsters died, in the very change that fitted the earth for a higher order of being. It was written before time began in the eternal programme, and inevitable step in the great march of ages.</p> 
               <p>The announcement of the adventure that had befallen their townsfolk, left no bosom unmoved in Merrifield. It awoke evil memories that had not yet passed into oblivion. While women trembled, and children's cheeks grew pale, the men took down their rifles, and sallied forth to the public corners, with looks and gestures that boded no good to whatever might challenge their resentment. They stood about in knots, eagerly<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6274-00000150"/> engaged in conversation upon what had been and what was to be done, while waiting for the appearance of Butler, whose slumbers had been prolonged beyond the usual hour by the toil and excitement of the previous day.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile, James and Mary were seated at the late breakfast, over which the dame presided with a perplexed and anxious look, as if she had fallen out of the clouds, or rather fallen into them. Roused from her first nap of the night before by the arrival of the wanderers, she had listened to their story with an amazement and terror that precluded all possibility of comprehending its details. She therefore cried herself to sleep again, and awoke in the morning with those indefinite and horrible impressions that weigh down one who has suffered with the nightmare. The morning household cares relieved for a while the uneasy feeling; but now, seated at leisure, curiosity and affectionate interest led her to fresh inquiry. But the truth was, that the good old lady's mind had no department appropriate to ideas so startling as grew out of this matter. She could not domiciliate them at all among her own quiet, gentle, and every-day notions. They came and went like the shadows that swept across the floor; and she had neither the power nor the wish to detain them. Her energy was not equal to the task, and her kindness loathed it. It was utterly impossible for her to conceive how people would or could be, do, or suffer, under circumstances of such out-of-the-way fashion; and the more she pondered, the deeper was her bewilderment.</p> 
               <p>"Now, James," said she, "do you suppose you really killed the Indian?"</p> 
               <p>"I am afraid there is no doubt of it, mother. It wasn't a pleasant job; but if we hadn't killed him, he would have killed us."</p> 
               <p>"O dear me,-well, it's awful! But perhaps he wouldn't have hurt you, after all, if you had asked him not to."</p> 
               <p>"I don't think he would have cared much, mother, for anything I could say; besides," said he, with a sly look at Mary, "you know I can't speak Iroquois."</p> 
               <p>"Sure enough, I didn't think of that. But I'm awful sorry you killed the creature."</p> 
               <p>"Well, mother," replied Butler, a little annoyed, "what could I do? what would you have done?"</p> 
               <p>"I? goody gracious!" ejaculated the old lady, in terror at the very thought of such a predicament. "I? why, I should have run away and screamed."</p> 
               <p>"And much good that would do," responded her son quietly.</p> 
               <p>"I know it wouldn't do any good. But what could a body do?"</p> 
               <p>The dreadful necessity of taking the life of a fellow-being was beyond her kindly logic. The genial instincts and peaceful propensities of her nature were too strong for any effort her reason could make; and she sat silent, and hopelessly perplexed to justify a deed so painful.</p> 
               <p>Sam Shirk had come in to inquire after Mary and James, and was sitting in the chimney-corner, with his little black pipe between his lips, waiting till his friends had finished their meal, and his rude politeness would allow him to indulge in his matutinal "smoke." He had listened, as he often did, with a queer mixture of respect and astonishment, to the old lady's rambling notions, till the astonishment got the better of the respect; as he saw the light in which she was inclined to<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6274-00000151"/> view an act, to him so evidently necessary and even praiseworthy.</p> 
               <p>"Why, ma'am," exclaimed he, "'twan't nothing but an Indian; and if we hadn't a took care of him, we should all have been scalped in less than no time. There was no more of 'em than we could handle just behind."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Sammooel, I hope 'twas right. But you know we never should kill anything when we can help it."</p> 
               <p>"To be sure not, ma'am, not Christians, nor even decent dumb beasts for nothing," argued Sam; "but don't you kill spiders and snakes, ma'an?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I kill spiders when they get into the house; but I'm afraid of snakes."</p> 
               <p>Butler now rose from table, asking his mother's leave by a silent nod, and signed to Sam to give over the useless controversy. He knew well his mother's mind would never extricate itself from such metaphysical difficulties; and must be left to flounder by itself, till time and oblivion deadened the trouble that would not be reasoned away. He then took his rifle from the corner where he had left it the night before, and proceeded to put it in order; while Shirk lighted his pipe and commenced a careful examination of the gun taken from the Indian. He tried the lock, then sighted along the barrel, examined the stock, and drew the rod.</p> 
               <p>"Be careful, Sam, that gun is probably loaded."</p> 
               <p>"I'll take care. It's a fair piece, but 'tan't a priming to yours. I think it's full better than mine, though."</p> 
               <p>"Well, let it be yours, then. You are welcome to my share of it."</p> 
                
               <p>"Thank you kindly, I'll take it out and try it some time. But I'll stick to my old rifle to-day. I know just what that'll do, to a shaving."</p> 
               <p>"To-day!" echoed Dame Butler in tones of alarm; "there an't to be any more fighting, I hope, James."</p> 
               <p>"Why, mother, we must look after these Indians or they'll be doing mischief. You wouldn't have our houses burnt, our cattle stolen, and perhaps people murdered, would you?"</p> 
               <p>"O my! what awful things folks do do! well, what are you going about?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, I suppose the neighbors will be for scouring the woods, to find out at least what is going on. Are they getting ready for a scout outdoors, Sam?"</p> 
               <p>"An't they!" exclaimed Sam exultingly, for his blood was up to fever heat. "Every rifle in Merrifield's been cleaned this morning. They're only waiting for you."</p> 
               <p>"O James!" said Mary, turning pale, "are you going out among those savages again?"</p> 
               <p>"O James!" cried his mother, "do stay and take care of us, and let somebody else kill the rest of the Indians."</p> 
               <p>"Why, Mary, you wouldn't have me leave my quarrel and yours to the neighbors, certainly. There is no other way to protect the village from these bloodhounds, mother, but to keep them at a distance. There is no danger. There will be enough of us now to manage all the Indians between here and the Aroostook."</p> 
               <p>Butler's heightened color and flashing eye told plainly that remonstrance was out of place; and Mary, casting upon him a look of mingled pride and anxiety, quietly busied herself in making his preparations for the expedition.</p> 
               <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6274-00000152"/> 
               <p>"The old lady sat herself down in her arm-chair, saying to herself as she mechanically took up her knitting, "It's no use to talk to him. He's just like his father; when the old Adam gets up, he won't hear to reason." The tears fell so fast from her eyes that she could not see the ends of her needles. Yet she knitted away with all her might, rocking herself to and for, as if the fate of the world depended upon her diligence.</p> 
               <p>Everything was ready in a few minutes; and with an affectionate kiss and a cheering word to his mother and Mary, Butler left the house with Shirk, and joined their neighbors in the street.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head> 
               <p>BUTLER was a great favorite with his townsmen; and his appearance was greeted by a general stir of inquiry and congratulation. After having satisfied curiosity, by a clear and succinct account of the incidents of the preceding day, he concluded by asking in his turn, "Have you decided what to do?"</p> 
               <p>"Hardly. We have been waiting to hear what you and Shirk had to say. You can judge best how many, of 'em there are, and where we might be likely to find 'em."</p> 
               <p>"Why, no, Mr. Campbell. Shirk saw five, and doesn't know whether there are more or not. I saw only one; and he is out of the way of mischief. Sam first fell in with them near Pleasant Mountain, and that's all we know. But here comes Wishcomet. He may be able to tell us something."</p> 
               <p>A tall young Indian turned a corner at the farther end of the bridge, and was now crossing it slowly, with his rifle upon his shoulders. He was well formed, erect and easy in his motions, as good proportions and active habits necessarily made him. His features were bold and prominent, as usual with his race, but open and pleasant in their general expression; while his bright black eye shone with all the acuteness and more than the ordinary information of his people. His dress was picturesque and characteristic, as it commonly is, even<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6274-00000153"/> with those of the natives whose position leads them to adopt the fabrics of civilization in their clothing, in lieu of the ruder materials of savage life. It was also marked by the preference for strong and brilliant colors that always prevails among uncivilized peoples, but arranged with a better taste and greater sense of fitness than would have been exhibited by a common savage. He was the lineal descendant of the Sachems of the Passamaquoddies; and, although the broken condition and lost independence of his tribe left but little of real authority and influence to its head, the acknowledged preminence still imparted a dignity of character and mien not unworthy of a much more elevated position. Like all Indians brought by the progress of events within the territorial limits of white jurisdiction, the tribe had already lost something of native character, without acquiring any valuable qualities or habits in return.</p> 
               <p>They were something less Indian, but not a whit more civilized. Compelled, by the changes that had taken place around them, to seek some novel means of supplying their necessities, a petty barter with their white neighbors in baskets, seal-oil, furs, and other products of rude manufacture or the chase had superseded, to some extent, their former independent life. They wore such clothing as they could buy, beg, or sometimes steal, in lieu of furs or dressed skins; used guns instead of bows and arrows, and procured their food partially by exchanges with the whites, instead of finding it altogether in the woods and rivers. But they had acquired no habit of steady industry, and added nothing to the comfort of their condition. Roving, desultory, and indolent, their small share in the results of civilization was a necessity, and not an improvement; and, wherever it was possible, they tenaciously adhered to their ancestral usages. In this perverse rejection of all refinement and amelioration, whatever was its cause, must be found the chief reason of the degradation and destruction of the aborigines. The great wave of foreign power and change swept rapidly and resistlessly over their land. They would not move with its current, nor submit to be borne along by its tide. Consequently they were buried forever beneath it, or dashed in wretched ruin into nooks and corners, to wither away in decrepitude and helplessness. But the Passamaquoddies were, at this time, yet upon the outer verge of Anglo-Saxon progress. Diminished in numbers and broken in spirit, they had still a semblance of national character, and had not yet reached that abnegation, of all valuable and hopeful traits characteristic of a crushed and ruined race. Their young Sachem, or Governor, as the whites termed him, deserved and received considerable respect, both from regard to his station and his own good qualities. For, upheld, as we have said, by a sense of personal distinction and self-respect, above the rapidly declining standard of his followers, he was sober, honorable, generous, and manly. He had not the bitter spirit, born of revenge and conscious degradation, so common among his unfortunate people, but seemed to seek to maintain an equal and frank intercourse where struggle was useless, and complaint vain. A quiet melancholy of expression and a reserved staidness of demeanor, at variance with his youth and disposition, showed, "however, that his own spirit, too, was overcast with the sorrows of the present and the dark shadow of the future.</p> 
               <p>The young Sachem came up, and, saluting the group<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6274-00000154"/> with a quiet nod, stood resting upon his rifle. He was dressed in a blue hunting-shirt, ornamented at the bottom with a red fringe, and girt about his waist with a sash of the same color. His blue leggings were adorned up and down the outside seam with a similar fringe to that which bordered the frock; and his feet were protected with moccasins beautifully worked with the quills of the porcupine, in various colors. A blue cloth cap bordered with fur, with the emblematic eagle's feather gracefully bending over its front, covered his jetty hair. A dark gray blanket, banded with red, was thrown loosely over his shoulder, and a broad silver medal, suspended from his neck by a cord, hung upon his chest.</p> 
               <p>There was a moment's pause, in deference to the known habit of the natives, who never allow themselves to evidence the impatient eagerness of white men in opening a conference. Wishcomet stood like a fine bronze statue, till he was addressed by Butler.</p> 
               <p>"Does the Governor know there are strange Indians above?"</p> 
               <p>"One of our hunters came down last night, and brought in the clothes of a red man that was killed in the woods by two whites."</p> 
               <p>"It was the tracks of Shirk and myself that he saw. I know that part of the story; but what was the Indian that was killed?"</p> 
               <p>"His dress and paint were that of the Indians of the great lakes."</p> 
               <p>"Sam, have you that wampum belt about you? the chief will know it."</p> 
               <p>Shirk came forward, and held up the embroidered belt. Wishcomet glanced at it a moment, and then replied, "Iroquois."</p> 
                
               <p>"So I said, Governor," said Sam.</p> 
               <p>Butler then went on:-</p> 
               <p>"Do you know anything about them, Governor,-their numbers, and what they are about?"</p> 
               <p>"Succobash saw only the dead man, and he had been hidden in the bushes."</p> 
               <p>"Well, then, I don't see that you can enlighten us much. We must go and find out for ourselves. Will you go with us, Governor?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and carry some of our men, if you want them. Then Iroquois are enemies: you are friends."</p> 
               <p>"Get three or four of your best young men, Chief, if you will, and assist us to hunt up these chaps. We can take care of them fast enough, if we can only find them."</p> 
               <p>"I will be back in half an hour," answered the Sachem, turning to depart.</p> 
               <p>"One moment, Governor. You know best of us all how to go to work. Give us your opinion."</p> 
               <p>"There must be a good many. They wouldn't come so far, if not. Twenty or thirty men, at least, ought to go. Succobash shall put on the dead man's dress. Then we must contrive to find their trail. They will either go home right away after this, or hide till night for a chance to strike."</p> 
               <p>"So I think, Governor. They will know well enough we shall be after them to-day. If they are strong enough to risk it, they will keep close to-day, and try for their revenge to-night. The moon rises at ten o'clock. Get your men here as quick as possible. We will be ready."</p> 
               <p>The young chief now started for the encampment of his people, which was then about a mile below the village; for tribes in communication with the settlements<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6274-00000155"/> ments, though they will neither quarter with their white neighbors, nor make permanent villages by themselves, in most instances, generally pitch their wigwams within convenient distance for intercourse, unless upon a hunting or fishing expedition.</p> 
               <p>The assembly held a hasty consultation, on the departure of the Sachem, and made their arrangements upon the brief hints already suggested. Forty active and resolute men were selected, and unanimously chose Butler for their commander. The rest were to remain to guard the village against attack. The band chosen for the expedition, at Butler's suggestion, immediately set about preparing themselves with three days' provision and arms and ammunition. In a short time all were at the rendezvous, ready to march.</p> 
               <p>About the same time Wishcomet returned, bringing with him four followers, besides Succobash, arrayed in the garb of the slain Indian. The latter had also painted his face in the fashion which he had noticed on the dead man. He was therefore well prepared to pass for one of the enemy, should circumstances require it; and nothing but a very close examination would betray him. At his chief's suggestion, he wound a bright red cord around the stock of his gun, as if it had been split and hastily repaired, in order that he might not be mistaken by his friends.</p> 
               <p>The party then started up the river, trusting to chance and their own diligence and ingenuity for the successful issue of their enterprise.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head> 
               <p>BUTLER and the Indian chief walked side by side a little in advance of their companions. Of nearly equal age and position, each was, both by circumstance and capacity, the natural leader of his comrades. Both, active, resolute, and quick of apprehension, frank, generous, and warm-hearted, were qualified to sustain ably the preminence which their popular qualities secured them. But how different the career that opened before them! The young Anglo-Saxon, a fortunate member of a dominant race, happy in the present and ambitious of the future, saw his nation advancing with an almost incredible rapidity on the road to prosperity. His heart glowing with the confidence of hope and the energy of power, he felt that he had but to will the accomplishment of every reasonable wish and legitimate purpose. His bright eye and elastic tread, his cheerful laugh and spontaneous independence of manner gave outward token of his feelings and his thoughts. But Wishcomet, though scarcely yet a man, wore the grave and chastened air of long experience. Still in the very spring-tide of his youth, he had already lived a life-time of sorrows in the misfortunes of his people. The anxious apprehensions and bitter trials of life had already laid the weight of years upon his brow, and oppressed his heart with a burden, beneath which it throbbed painfully and convulsively<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6274-00000156"/> vulsively. To him, the present was a hopeless struggle against evil, and the future a dark gulf which no eye could fathom and no joy could light. His springing and easy step showed the activity of perfect physical powers, but it had the languor of restricted purposes and sad anticipations. A melancholy quiet pervaded his features, and shone from his deep-set eye, except at times; when, from a memory of the past or a galling surmise of insult or wrong, it would flash, for a moment, with the natural spirit of his years and race. But it was only to settle back into a despondency, the more touching that it had nothing of the sullen Indian ferocity, which might, however, have been pardoned to despair. The one, like a young eagle, looking out from his lofty, perch over field and forest, hailing the joyous light of morning, and balancing himself upon eager wing to swoop forth on his fearless errand; the other, like the same gallant bird retreating at evening, stricken and sore, to his wonted station, with drooping wing and glazing eye, looking dreamily into the darkness that is fast hiding from him the scene of his free, bold life, that shall see no new morning.</p> 
               <p>There existed a feeling of friendliness between the youths, heightened on the part of Butler by sympathy, and on that of the young chief by gratitude. They often hunted and fished together, and free intercourse had begotten a mutual respect and good-will. Their thoughts and speech were turned, at this time, upon the object of their present expedition; and they agreed in the opinion that the hostile Indians, if they had not retreated, would be hovering on the rear of the upper settlements of the river; and that the best course was to proceed at once to that quarter. By this plan, immediate aid might be afforded to the isolated farms; while, if they chanced to pass the enemy, they would be in a position to intercept his retreat. The door of Captain Dee's farm-house was reached, as they concluded the discussions by this arrangement.</p> 
               <p>The old gentleman and William stood, gun in hand, awaiting their approach.</p> 
               <p>"We heard about an hour ago of yesterday's affair, James," said the Captain, as he wrung Butler's hand with cordial interest. "You and Mary escaped famously. If those copper-skins do as well for themselves, they will be lucky. Why, you've a small army here."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Captain, there are plenty of us. I think you and William may as well stay at home, and take care of your premises and old Polly."</p> 
               <p>"D--n old Polly! if the Indians carry her off, she's as fit for a squaw as anything else. William's determined to go with you, and I'm determined to go with William. So you'll have to take us both."</p> 
               <p>"Well, for my part at least, I shall not regret it, as you know. Tell me what you think of the plan Wishcomet and I have formed." Butler then excited the conclusions upon which himself and his associate had rested. Dee assented to their propriety, and the party proceeded, with numbers thus increased, upon their road.</p> 
               <p>It was about noon, as they had crossed the river at the Falls, and passed a mile or two beyond, when one of the scouts-of whom several had been thrown out on the flanks and front-gave the signal of alarm, by lifting his cap upon his rifle and giving a low and peculiar whistle, that was passed from mouth to mouth till it reached the main body. The company had been simply organized into two platoons, with directions<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6274-00000157"/> sufficient for the sudden emergencies so common in forest warfare. At the signal, Butler waved his hand, and his followers immediately sprang into the woods, half of them on either side, and instantly concealed themselves behind the trees and bushes, in a semicircular formation, in order to protect their flanks against surprise. They remained thus, silent and motionless, with the exception of their leaders, who sought by cautions examination to discover any movement in the woods around. After the lapse of a few minutes, the advanced scout was seen to emerge from the cover which he had taken upon giving his signal, and join a single individual who was now plainly visible coming down the path. Convinced by this that the intruder was a friendly one, the band stepped out again into the track, and the sharpest-sighted among them directly pronounced it to be Joe Sibley.</p> 
               <p>"That is fortunate, James," said Captain Dee. "Joe will be able to tell us what's going on above. His eyes are sharp ones, and he's always roving about."</p> 
               <p>Joe, with the patrols from the front, now all came in together, and a rapid interchange of information and conjectures took place. Sibley had already gathered, from the advanced guard, the main points of Butler's adventure of the day before and of their plans and purposes.</p> 
               <p>"This is jest the thing," said he to Butler. "I was on my way to the Falls to raise some men to look after these darned red devils. There are too few of us, in the upper settlement, to scour the woods and keep our houses safe too. They're all'on the watch above, though. But as I had three men in my house, I thought I could risk it to run down for help. But I'm plaguy glad to meet you half-way; for ye see I didn't want to be away over night. We didn't know of the frolic you'd had with 'em, Butler. But last night my dogs were howling like destruction, and we got up and went out, supposing there was a bear or a wolf about the barn. We couldn't see nothin', though it was bright moonlight. But this mornin' I looked into the edge of the woods, and found what I took for the print of moccasins; and I consated there was some mischief round. I tracked 'em across the ridge and to the big Mopang Lake, though the tracks was terrible faint. But I didn't dare to show myself on the ice, for I judged by the signs that there's twenty or more of 'em. So I took the back track, and came straight down. I guess we'll give 'em some now, if they an't made off."</p> 
               <p>"Well, that's pretty much as I'd figured it," observed Shirk. "'Twas round there I first saw 'em; and I expected they'd skulk thereabouts. I'll be my rifle I can go straight to 'em. Governor, don't you know the deep gully where the brook makes in towards the head of the lake, all sot round with high hills and thunderin' tall pines? That's the place for 'em, dead sure. They can see the whole length of the lake from there; but the devil a body could see them, unless he climbed a tree right over their heads. It's just the place for a skulking-hole."</p> 
               <p>Wishcomet expressed his concurrence in the conjecture by a nod of assent. Basing their schemes upon this supposition, it was decided to proceed, after a short rest, to Sibley's house, about six miles off. There a few men were to be detached in various quarters to garrison two or three of the most exposed houses, while the remainder were to watch, and, if need be, fight the enemy. The afternoon was nearly half spent when the main body halted at Sibley's dwelling,<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6274-00000158"/> having first sent off the reinforcements for the outskirting points that seemed to be in danger of surprise. These latter had orders to watch carefully and to patrol constantly, as far as safety allowed. A line of videttes of ten men, to maintain a communication across the front between the various posts, was organized and intrusted to a resolute and trusty leader. Various signals were also arranged to convey information, if need required, by discharges of guns, which might be heard by attentive ears over the whole field of operations. The force left behind might thus serve both as a garrison and a reserve. It secured the settlement from insult, being sufficient to sustain any probable attack till succors could arrive, and might be summoned to the front in part or in whole, should the discoveries and position of the main body require it.</p> 
               <p>Great pains were taken, at Butler's command, to conceal all these movements from prying eyes. The main body of the expedition entered into Sibley's clearing from the deep woods in the rear, and stole into the house by twos and threes, so as to be covered by the buildings from any who might be watching the settlement from the side of the forest.</p> 
               <p>After a march of twenty miles, the men in general were inclined to give a very zealous and undivided attention to refreshment, both in the way of food and rest. The leading spirits, nevertheless, mingled with these vulgar cares earnest consultations and careful conjectures of the probabilities upon which it would be safest to act.</p> 
               <p>In sudden emergencies, whether affecting greater or less issues, whether they occur in mighty empires or petty hamlets, lies the sure test of manly character. On such occasions, daring and wisdom take the ascendancy ancy, just as surely as the atmosphere rises above the grosser and heavier particles of the material world. Shake up a community, little or great, till each individual disengages himself from conventional regulations and artificial restraints, and it must follow, as matter of course, that each will assume, at least for a time, the rank which his specific gravity assigns him in the human scale. Experience, courage, genius, then assert their prerogative, and maintain it upon the great law of natural affinities. Thus, in this little company of borderers, as much as in the armies of Napoleons and the cabinets of great nations, the strong spirits and the clear heads, instinctively and without contradiction, assumed the direction. While, in Sibley's kitchen, the undistinguished members ate and drank, and smoked, and chatted, and stretched themselves at length to rest their wearied limbs, Butler, the Dees, Sibley, Wishcomet, and two or three more, conferred together in the other appartment; and came to conclusions which were sure to command the concurrence and zealous coperation of their comrades. Seated around the table, on which were spread materials for the restoration of their physical energies, they debated upon the various suggestions that presented themselves for consideration. James's modesty had surrendered to the superior age of Captain Dee the duty of presiding over the little council of war. The Captain occupied the great flag-bottomed chair, with his glass of brandy and water before him and his pipe, in hand or mouth. Behind him, on a stool, young William sat, just without the circle, quietly and intelligently listening to the suggestions of his seniors. Butler, Sibley, and three other of the prominent whites sat around the board; and the reserved and dignified<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6274-00000159"/> young Sachem, at its foot, answered briefly but clearly to the frequent appeals made by his more loquacious friends to his well-known shrewdness and sagacity. Unceremoniously, but decorously, the various opinions were stated and compared, in reply to the calls of the chairman.</p> 
               <p>"Wishcomet, you are the best judge, after all, where these fellows are likely to be secreted. What do you think?"</p> 
               <p>"They would not feel safe nearer than the lake's head. They need not go any further to be out of sight. I should camp there, if I were their chief."</p> 
               <p>"Then we all seem to think that conclusion pretty sure. Is there any other spot thereabouts so secret and convenient as the gully Shirk spoke of?"</p> 
               <p>"None to compare with it," Sibley broke in. "There's their camp, ten to one."</p> 
               <p>"It's most important of all to guess right in this matter," added Dee. "Is there any way, Wishcomet, to make sure of it?"</p> 
               <p>"Our eyes will tell us," replied the chief. "The ridge is between them and us. They will light a fire to cook their venison. We could see their smoke from the ridge."</p> 
               <p>"But may they not have a lookout upon the hill themselves, Wishcomet?" inquired Butler.</p> 
               <p>"The lake is nearly four miles long. The forest behind is dark. They will only watch the ice and the other side of the ridge. A lookout on this side might be seen as well as see; they know your eyes will be sharp."</p> 
               <p>"That's the talk, Captain," rejoined Sibley. "They won't venture a spy on this side in broad day. Their game is to keep snug till night-fall. Now, my notion's just this way. Let Wishcomet and Succobash go with me and any one other of our men; and we'll soon know whether there's anything to be seen from the top of Pleasant Mountin. I know the ground as well as my way to bed; I can get to a first-rate chance to range the lake, and never quit cover neither. I'll spy 'em out, without their knowin' anybody's lookin', you may depend. Now, Butler, you stay here till towards dark; and then let the men creep into the woods behind here, and lead 'em quietly across, by the little round pond out yonder, to the head of the Sinclair Brook. If we find we an't safe on the mountin, we'll come back to the beaver-dam on the upper swamp, and join you. If you don't find us there, foller along right up the swale to the ledge on top o' the hill. You know the big rock, close by that little old birch, pretty nigh the flat ledge, don't you? Now I will get up under that; and from there I can see all over t' other side. If we need any more risky scouting, we'll send Succobash ahead. If they should spy him, maybe they won't mistrust that he wan't one of their own men stragglin' round. In about an hour, let somebody go up to my garret winder; you can see this side of the rock from there, plain. It'll be just about sunset too, and be bright as a dollar on the west side of the ledge. If we see signs of 'em, we'll all stand in a row and swing our caps. Then you'll have nothin' to do but to come up to us as fast you can. If we don't make the signal, you must come along as you think best; only meet us, at all events, at the beaver-dam, or above. If there's any great trouble, of course we'll come back as fast as we can, to let you know. How will that do?"</p> 
               <p>"Capitally, Joe," said Butler. "I see but one<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6274-00000160"/> thing more to provide for. It is six miles from the top of the ridge to the head of the lake. We can't cross the ice; for we should be all shot down, or the Indians would be sure to escape into the woods. We must go round and take them in the rear, which will make two or three miles further. How can we manage this, Wishcomet?"</p> 
               <p>"Why need we go to them? Make an ambush at the foot of the lake, and they will come to us."</p> 
               <p>"That's it exactly; how stupid I was! Well, we must get on to the ground as quickly as possible, to have time to arrange everything."</p> 
               <p>"We'll have time enough," said Sibley. "I know the whole ground like a book. As they won't be disturbed, they'll take the road that I tracked 'em on this mornin'. It's the nateral one for anybody comin' this way. We'll fix 'em easy."</p> 
               <p>"The sooner you start the better, Joe," suggested Captain Dee. "There's a bare pattern of time for everything to work in right."</p> 
               <p>"I'm ready. Come, Governor, you call Succobash and I'll take Tom Bray with me. If we get into a tight fix anyhow, Butler, we may naterally have to fire; and if you hear us, you must put along to help us."</p> 
               <p>"I will send six men along with you, Joe, to stop at the beaver-dam until we come up. You will then have something to fall back on, in case of emergency."</p> 
               <p>"Very well. Come, Governor, let's be movin'."</p> 
               <p>Butler, Sibley, with the Sachem and the rest, then went into the other room. After explaining briefly the plan of operations, James addressed his men as follows: "Now, boys, you all know well enough that a bush-fight, such as we shall have, if we catch these fellows, will be no joke. We can't have a man with us that isn't ready for the scratch. If any of you mean to hang back, do it how, when you will get nobody into a scrape by it. Those who prefer it, can stay here and guard this house. Let those who don't want to go with us, step over to that side, and those who are ready for whatever comes, stand on this."</p> 
               <p>In a moment every man in the room stood as near to Butler as their numbers permitted, and the farther end of the room was bared.</p> 
               <p>"That's well. I needn't tell you now that the man that flinches"-</p> 
               <p>"Is a d--d coward and a traitor!" broke in Captain Dee, emphatically winding up Butler's oration.</p> 
               <p>"Amen!" shouted Sibley, and "Amen!" resounded round the crowded room."</p> 
               <p>"Now," resumed Butler, "I want six volunteers to go with Sibley, Wishcomet, Bragg, and Succobash, and do whatever Sibley or the Sachem orders. Who will go?"</p> 
               <p>Every man, in a breath, answered, "I."</p> 
               <p>"Good again, boys. But I want only six. Let these go." With his hands James waved off the half-dozen who stood next him. The little party thus designated, trailed their rifles, and moved instantly to the door.</p> 
               <p>"Go out by the back door, boys, one by one, and keep under the rich fence, and stop in the woods behind the barn. Keep snug under the cover, so that nobody can see you from the ridge."</p> 
               <p>Sibley and the young chief saw their party file through the door, and then followed after them. Crouching behind the line of fence, they stole around<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6274-00000161"/> the out-building and into the woods in the rear. After selecting two men to march a few rods upon either flank, Joe and his Indian friend led the remainder down into the hollow at the foot of the hill, then, facing to the north, proceeded briskly along their road.</p> 
               <p>"Now no talking or smoking; look sharp ahead. If you see anything like an Indian, take cover, and be ready to obey orders."</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head> 
               <p>A RAPID walk of two miles brought the party to the foot of the ridge. The waters of a swamp, from which issued a considerable brook, were here thrown back so as to form a small pond, by a dike of trees and earth some three or four feet high and about as much in width, the work of that little animal whose instinct and industry are sufficient to excite the admiration even of reasoning man. A dense thicket of young firs and spruces grew close upon the edge of the pond. Here Sibley stationed six of his companions.</p> 
               <p>"Lie down on the snow in the very thickest of the clump; and keep your mouths shut and your eyes and ears open. Don't fire at anything unless you are obliged. If you are attacked, which an't likely, hold on, if possible, till we join you. We shall take the back track, if we hear any muss here. If you hear us fire more than once round, come up to our support; and do it up handsome. Jem Small, you take the command till we come back. Now mind,-still and steady."</p> 
               <p>"With these injunctions, Joe and his three companions left them, and pursued their way along the borders of the swamp, until they reached a swale that wound in a regular ascent, between the swells of the mountain, to the summit. Half an hour brought them so near to the latter, that they caught occasional glimpses, through the trees, of the bare and storm-beaten rock<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6274-00000162"/> which formed the crest of the hill. Sibley now called his comrades close to his side by a silent gesture, and spoke in a low tone:-</p> 
               <p>"This swale comes out just on the nor'west of the big rock. If the Iroquois have a lookout on the hill, he will be behind that stone probably; and if there's anybody there, we must try to catch him without given' him a chance to fire or run. Governor, you and Succobash can worm along better than Tom or I can. If you will creep up a little to the left, so as to get a peep round the back side, Brag and I will foller you, jest under cover of the swale. If there's anythin' to be done, we'll be on hand. But don't show yourselves over the ridge, nohow."</p> 
               <p>Wishcomet expressed his consent by a silent nod, and, signing to Succobash to follow him, ascended by the slope that skirted on the left the hollow way by which they had hitherto advanced. Sibley and Bray continued along their original direction, keeping themselves just in the rear of their flankers. When the top of the ascent was nearly gained, the Indians threw themselves flat upon the ground and worked themselves slowly and cautiously along towards the spot to be examined. Sibley and Bray remained meanwhile crouched motionless among the stinted growth of the barren and inhospitable height, with eye and ear strained to the utmost, and their arms prepared for instant use; each holding his rifle in one hand and a keen hunting-knife in the other. After the lapse of ten anxious minutes, Wishcomet and his follower glided noiselessly back into the friendly shelter of the hollow.</p> 
               <p>"The hill is clear," said the Sachem.</p> 
               <p>"Well, then, let us creep up quietly to our side of the rock, and contrive how to get a peep round it."</p> 
                
               <p>The four, now turning slightly to the right, so as to approach the hither side of the boulder, soon gained their post at its foot. It was of more than sufficient height to protect them from observation beyond, even in an erect attitude; but, mindful of the signal agreed upon with Butler, they remained upon their hands and knees until they could complete their reconnoitring.</p> 
               <p>Sibley now laid aside his gun, and cut up with his hunting-knife a few of the straggling shrubs that grew among the hollows of the ledge. Collecting them in a bundle, he slowly and gently fixed them, in the form of a natural bush, in the snow just beyond the outer edge of the boulder.</p> 
               <p>"There now, Governor, I don't think the devils will see how sudden that bush growed up here, unless they're nearer than we think; and they won't see our noddles through the stalks neither. I claim the patent for the invention; so I'll take fust look, and then give you a chance."</p> 
               <p>So saying, he threw off his cap, and, cautiously pocking his head forward behind the little screen, took a careful survey of the ground below them. Then, drawing back again behind the rock, he said, in a tone of high satisfaction, "By jimini, Wishcomet, they're right there. I see their smoke jest over the trees where the brook comes into the lake. You take a look and see how you make it out."</p> 
               <p>The young chieftain now applied his eye in turn to the openings in the brush-wood. He made a leisurely survey of the extensive prospect in front of them, and, drawing himself back, replied to Sibley's look of interrogation, "They are there."</p> 
               <p>"Well, boys, now for the signal. Stand up in a line again the rock, and put yer caps on yer rifles."</p> 
               <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6274-00000163"/> 
               <p>The manuvre was instantly performed according to the direction; and a handkerchief shaken from the little square window in the distant gable of Joe's house showed them that the movement was seen and understood. Butler himself had long been watching their motions through Captain Dee's pocket-glass, and made the answering signal.</p> 
               <p>"Now we'll start down again," said Sibley. Carefully withdrawing from their exposed observatory, the scouts rejoined their comrades below, to await the coming the Butler with the rest of the company.</p> 
               <p>Butler and William Dee descended from the garret, where they had kept watch, and reported the result to their friends.</p> 
               <p>"All right, Captain: the signal has been given that things are according to our expectation. There can be no Indians this side of the ridge; and it will be better to start immediately."</p> 
               <p>"Well, James, the sooner the better, if at all. I have been thinking here, over my pipe, that it isn't very charitable business to be hunting down these poor miserable devils, after all."</p> 
               <p>"What's the alternative, Captain Dee? They hunted me yesterday, and will hunt you to-morrow if we don't hunt them to-day. It's a thing to be avoided, if possible; but how can you do it? You can't tame them, you can't frighten them, you can't coax them. You can't fit them for neighbors to civilized men, for they won't be civilized. You and I must give up our corn-fields, or they must lose their hunting-grounds: there is no reconciling the two. I have thought of this too, and was wishing we could surround and catch these fellows, with as little bloodshed as may be. But how can it be done, and, if done, where's the gain? You must release them again, with heads and hearts fuller than ever with hatred and revenge, or keep them prisoners for life. All the parsons and schoolmasters in Maine won't change them. There's Wishcomet: he's the only Indian I ever saw that seems capable of being civilized. I sometimes think his blood must be crossed. And even he is as Indian, in some respects, as the best of them. What use could you put him to in one of our towns? You may as well try to keep partridges in a barn-yard instead of hers."</p> 
               <p>"Sure enough, James, sure enough. Give a squaw a gown, and she'll tie the sleeves round her neck, and hang it down her back. But his isn't the time for talk; we can't mend this matter now. We must do the best we cart. But the notion of taking these chaps alive is rather chimerical, as you say. We must go ahead, and come out as we can."</p> 
               <p>They then proceeded to summon the men for the march; and in a few moments all left the house, in the same way the others had done, and started for the beaver-dam.</p> 
               <p>Butler gave out his orders for the disposition of his little force. "Archie Campbell, take three men a few rods out to the right; Laighton, you take as many to the left flank. I'll take Wishcomet's three men, and look out in front. Make no noise, but push along; there is not much danger of interruption just here."</p> 
               <p>A quick and steady pace soon brought them to the rendezvous, where they joined the reconnoitring party. Sibley and Wishcomet related circumstantially to Butler and the rest what they had seen, and a short halt was ordered to decide finally upon the mode in which the information thus gained should be turned to account.</p> 
               <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6274-00000164"/> 
               <p>"The sun will set in less than an hour. We ought to be at our posts on the other side by dark, which will give us a short two hours for all our arrangements."</p> 
               <p>"That's true, Butler; but I think we can arrange here, and very quick too," replied Sibley. "They took to the lake this mornin', at the head of the deep cove on the sou'west side, close to the bottom, you know. Now, you remember, there's an island runs in the rake of the cove, across the middle of the water. These chaps won't start till near mornin', or say midnight. It'll be moonlight, and they'll keep down the east shore, and cross under the shadow of the island, to keep out of sight as much as they can. Besides, it's altogether the easiest and shortest way to cross the ridge, and they'll take it as they did afore. We must ambush 'em at the head of the cove."</p> 
               <p>"What do you think of this, Wishcomet? You know the ground well."</p> 
               <p>"I think Sibley is right. They'll come that way; and if they should go off below at the outlet, we shall be behind, and can cut them off."</p> 
               <p>"Just so, and I don't see what better we can do. How does it strike you, Captain Dee?"</p> 
               <p>"It's far the likeliest plan in my mind," replied Dee.</p> 
               <p>"Then so let it be. Now, men, we'll take a quarter of an hour to rest. Do up all your eating, smoking, and talking before we start. We must push for the spot, and be still as death when we get there, or our game's up at once. Take your ease now; then for work."</p> 
               <p>In obedience to Butler's suggestion, the party now prepared themselves for the night's work. Some ate and drank, some lighted their pipes; all looked to their flints, and freshened the priming of their rifles.</p> 
                
               <p>"It will be of no use to try to conceal our tracks on this side, will it, Joe?" asked Butler.</p> 
               <p>"Not a mite of use. All we want is to get where we're bound without their knowin' on't. I'll bet they'll never see our tracks, unless we bring 'em back this way, with their hands tied behind their backs."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Joe, if Wishcomet and Succobash will go with me, I'll strike off to the north, and try to get a peep over the ridge about opposite where we take 'em to be. I am anxious to make sure of their camp if I can; then we shall know better what to count on. We'll come down the ridge and join you by dark. But you must lead the man over and post them; nobody can do it better than you."</p> 
               <p>"I'll do my best. If I don't suit you, you can shift, things to your mind, after you come in."</p> 
               <p>"O, no fear; we've talked the matter pretty well over together, and I can't mend your plan at all. Only be careful; don't let a soul show himself, or give them a chance to suspect. Wishcomet, will you and Succobash back me?"</p> 
               <p>"I'll go with you anywhere; and Succobash will go with me."</p> 
               <p>"Let's be off, then. You'd better be moving too, Joe."</p> 
               <p>Butler, with his two companions, now went off up the ridge, at a broad angle with the course taken by the main body, which was guided by Sibley so as to cross just in the rear of the exposed summit of the mountain, while the direction pursued by Butler was but slightly diagonal to that of the ridge itself. The highlands sloped gradually and regularly to the northward from the summit of the mountain which crowned its southern extremity, and formed the dividing line<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6274-00000165"/> between the waters of the Mopang on the east and the valley of the Narraguagus River on the west. Directly under the steep declivity of its eastern side was the broad Mopang Lake. Its foot lay directly opposite the spot where the halt had been made at the head-waters of the little tributary of the Narraguagus. To reach the deep bay at its lower extremity, already spoken of, it was necessary to cross the hilly barrier perpendicularly, or by a course about due east. It was Butler's object to cross it two miles farther north and to come out on the northwestern corner of the lake, opposite to the northeastern angle, where the hostile Indians were supposed to be hidden. Leaving for the present the bulk of our adventurers under Sibley's lead, we will follow the steps of the little reconnoitring party. Skirting, the upper edge of the low grounds, they traversed diagonally the belt of hemlocks, spruces, and scattered pines, that chiefly composed the growth upon the lower slopes, till they reached the more open woods of maples, birches, and beeches that covered the flanks of the ridge. The surface of the ground, in the black growth, as the woodsmen designated the resinous trees from the deep and dull tone of their foliage, was obstructed with the trailing underwood that struggles for a feeble existence in the shade of its lofty competitors. The verdure of the umbrella-like tops, far up overhead, acknowledging the failure of the generous sap of summer days only by a duller tint of green, shut out the waning brilliancy of the declining sun. A dim shade pervaded the evergreen forest; and the columnar trunks of the thickly set trees, interlaced with the humbler spray that occupied the spaces between, bounded the possibility of vision to a narrow space. A russet palisade, advancing with the advance of the wayfarers, encircled circled them around; and the deep shadow, which was but partially modified by the noonday sun, mocked at the feeble radiance of the western sky. Thus, while the mantle of spotless snow, that wrapped in its dazzling expanse the surface of the ground, rendered the minutest twig that dropped upon its surface or the smallest stem that rose through its bosom almost painfully distinct within a limited compass, a few rods from either side, the constantly intercepted distance was entirely shut out from sight. But, in the zone where the deciduous trees became the predominant occupiers of the soil, the atmosphere brightened. The straggling bushes became rare, while the western sun poured in among the bared branches upon the dazzling carpet of snow. The shadows of the tall skeletons of the trees were drawn distinctly upon the glittering white surface; and wherever a withered leaf still clung tenaciously to its stalk above, a mimic shadow fluttered and swayed to and fro below. The sparser and smaller trunks also permitted a more comprehensive range to the eye. Nevertheless, at a certain distance, and that not a remote one, the continuous and unbroken forest bounded in the view with its living wall.</p> 
               <p>As they drew near to the point where they purposed to cross the height of land and descend towards the head of the lake, on its further side, Butler said to his companions,-</p> 
               <p>"It may be that we should stumble upon a scout of the enemy hereabouts. It is far from the settlement and near their camp; and they may think it worth while to watch this side of the ridge a little. I think we must go along cautiously, Wishcomet. Suppose we should let Succobash move a few rods ahead of us. If he was seen, he would hardly be taken for one of a<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6274-00000166"/> white party, dressed as he is. He would pass for one of themselves or a stray hunter. He can give us a signal in time to keep out of sight. If they see only him, they would be puzzled at least, if not entirely misled. But if they should pursue us, we must draw them away from the lake; and when it grows dark, shift as well as we can.</p> 
               <p>"Right," rejoined the Sachem; and turning to Succobash, who was following just behind, he spoke a few words in their own tongue. Succobash then passed to the front; while his two companions paused till he attained a distance just within range of sight, when they resumed their own progress, keeping a constant eye upon his form, as it alternately disappeared and reappeared among the trees. No interruption, however, occurred; and Butler, judging that they had reached a point as high as desirable, after a time called in Succobash by a gesture, and directed him to strike to the eastward through a swale, which marked with a slight depression then interval between two of the rolling hills that composed the chain. Passing the height of the land, they soon reached the channel of a small brook which would downwards, carrying the waters of the declivities into the lake. Its narrow ice bed formed a path, at once easy to travel and sure to lead them speedily to the desired termination. It soon brought them to the foot of the slope; and the frequent breaks in the tree-tops before them warned them that they were upon the borders of the basin. The utmost circumspection was now necessary to avoid discovery from the keen eyes that were supposed to be occupying the further shore. Succobash was again called in; and the whole party halted to survey the ground, and select a spot whence they might safely command a view of the ice-bound sheet. The little stream here issued into the broad lake, that received its tribute, through a small savannah or interval, skirted both above and below by bolds bluffs that terminated on the shore. Upon the outer face of the lower most knoll, a huge hemlock, upturned by the fierce winds sweeping across the water, lay prostrate upon the ground with its roots turned up into the air. Wishcomet pointed to this natural breast work.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Sachem, that's the very chance for us. Just such a cover, as I was lucky enough to find in good time yesterday. We can see all we want from behind that old fellow. Succobash, creep through the alders down yonder and look round on the other side of the horse-back opposite; and make sure that there's nobody <emph>watching us.</emph>" In a few minutes that Indian returned and reported that all was quiet beyond. The three then ascended the knoll in front and gained the shelter of the fallen tree. Depositing their guns against the trunk, the young chief and Butler carefully surveyed the prospect in front through the loops of the tangled roots, while Succobash stood a watchful sentinel upon the hill-side a few paces behind them.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head> 
               <p>WHEN they had taken up their position, the Sachem pointed out to his companion a cluster of large rocks scattered at the furthermost corner of the lake, behind which opened a meadow running a short distance into the forest.</p> 
               <p>"The brook comes in through that meadow. You can see their smoke in the woods behind. We must be careful; there will be eyes behind those big stones."</p> 
               <p>Butler looked in the direction pointed out, and clearly distinguished the light wreath of vapor curling up above the trees into the clear air. For a short time, both gazed intently on the shore; but with the exception of the faint column that shadowed the blue sky, no sign of life could be detected. The level rays of the sun glinted over the frozen mirror, bathing in a clear bright glitter the blue ice and the shining girdle of snow that bordered round the edge of the forest. On their own side, the deep shadows of the lofty hills behind them buried every object in a dusky obscurity, in a strong contrast with the sharply defined and brilliantly lighted outlines that reflected upon the opposite shore the clear, golden rays of the wintry sunset.</p> 
               <p>"It seems as if we could see every pine twig over yonder, in this pure atmosphere. How beautiful the sunlight is, Sachem, among the rocks and on the banks and the smooth surface of the lake! How superbly it flashes on the ice and snow! and how magnificently it glides the front of the dark and solemn woods! Wishcomet, all this speaks a language that we both can understand equally well."</p> 
               <p>It was not till after a slight pause that the young chief replied in a low, melancholy tone, "The Great Spirit is good, and the world is beautiful." But the admission was concluded by a deep sigh, in sad contrast with the frank and cheerful buoyancy of Butler's comment, which induced his young companion to turn and look him fully in the face. He saw and appreciated the sadness that shadowed the dark eye of the Sachem; and the joyous admiration that lighted up his own features, instantly gave way to an expression of deep sympathy. He stretched out his hand silently to his comrade, who pressed it with convulsive emotion.</p> 
               <p>"Never mind, Wishcomet; you have done your duty, and I know you always will. Be of good cheer, and remember that James Butler will always be an honest friend to you and yours."</p> 
               <p>The bosom of the chief heaved with his struggling feelings; but he did not trust himself to speak. He again silently wrung James's proffered hand, while a gleam of melancholy gratitude spread a transient smile upon his countenance. The young men turned again to their watch, in the hope of yet obtaining some more definite information. Scarcely had they resumed their stand, when a low; hiss from Succobash aroused their attention to a sharp, light clatter on the ice below them. Directly a fine buck came rushing up the lake in front of them, closely pursued by two gaunt wolves. The ice was hard and slippery, but the sharp-edged hoofs of the deer enabled him to traverse it with<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6274-00000168"/> tolerable security, while it was evident that the claws of his pursuers were less adapted to its unyielding and glassy surface. They toiled along in a heavy gallop, while the deer bounded ahead in elastic leaps, that promised speedily to distance his pursuers. As the chase drew near, however, it became apparent to the experienced eye of a practiced hunter that the poor animal was hard run; and that his airy and rapid bounds were the exertions of desperate terror rather than of vigorous power. Distress and exhaustion were plainly visible. His tongue hung languidly from his mouth, his sides were heaving painfully, and every spring was evidently shorter and heavier than the preceding.</p> 
               <p>"Poor fellow," said Butler, "those devils will soon pull him down; they are death on a long chase."</p> 
               <p>The buck now turned his head; and, as he saw his deadly enemies gaining upon him at every step, extreme terror seemed to exhaust his remaining energies. His pace rapidly slackened, and the indefatigable pursuers pressed hard upon his heels. At last the foremost wolf came up alongside, and made a furious spring at the throat of his flying prey. The imminent peril aroused the flagging energies of his victim. Leaping to a great height, he sprang side wise over his assailant, and started off, at right angles, directly for the bank where the little patrol was hidden. Butler instinctively seized his rifle, and cocked it, but immediately let down the hammer again, and said, smiling,-</p> 
               <p>"What a boy I am behaving like! but, faith, I would give a farm, almost, to be able to shoot those two miscreants."</p> 
               <p>"And then to shoot the deer," added Wishcomet, in a tone of melancholy sportiveness.</p> 
                
               <p>"Ah, that speech is a little malicious, Sachem. But see, the wolves are on the track again. The scamps had to make a long round to turn upon the slippery ice. That big gray one, that made the dash, slid on his belly more than a rod, before he could bring up."</p> 
               <p>The gaunt beasts now closed again in their long swinging pace, and were once more almost side by side with their prey. Frantically the poor buck sped on, and doggedly his pursuers followed. Again the foremost wolf made his spring, and this time with more effect; for he reached the neck of the deer, and inflicted a slight wound. But the sudden shock overthrew both pursuer and pursued. Both of them lost their hold upon their slippery footing, and rolled over and over on the ice; while the second wolf shot ahead, unable immediately to arrest his career. For a second or two, the ferocious beast of prey and the timid deer lay panting and overdone upon the ice, within a few feet of each other. But again the wolf gathered himself up for a spring; and the trembling animal beside him, catching the threatening movement in his anxious eye, scrambled hastily up and commenced his flight anew, followed by both of his pertinacious enemies. He now directed his course exactly for the northeastern corner of the lake, and rapidly approached the rocks at the mouth of the gully.</p> 
               <p>"Now," said Butler, "we shall soon see whether there is any one out yonder."</p> 
               <p>The panting fugitive came up with the cluster of rocks and within a few rods of the woods, the wolves again close upon his heels. But now a little glancing point shot out from behind one of the boulders, just visible as it flew through the air, and the headmost wolf lay at his length upon the ice, transfixed with an<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6274-00000169"/> arrow. A second shaft was immediately twanged into the thigh of the other, arresting his career; and a third brought him also to the ground. The sorely beset buck, swerving from this demonstration, rushed towards the shore beyond, and was lost to view in the dense forest.</p> 
               <p>"Ah! that's all right," said Butler. "The poor beast has saved himself, after all; and those two rascals have got their deserts. I wonder they didn't shoot the buck too."</p> 
               <p>"Probably they have venison enough in their camp, and didn't want him. But the wolf-skins are in prime order; and Indians know, the fewer wolves, the more deer."</p> 
               <p>"That's it. But look sharp, Sachem, they're stealing out after the wolves. They can't have any suspicion of being watched, or they'd wait till dark. One, two, three,-and I see a fourth, among the stones, looking down the lake."</p> 
               <p>They stood still, a few minutes, during which the carcasses of the wolves were dragged off, and the Indians disappeared again from their view.</p> 
               <p>"We need stop no longer, Wishcomet. We have seen all that we shall see, and, indeed, all that we want. Let's creep down now, and join our friends below."</p> 
               <p>They then carefully descended the rear of the little hill, and, striking into the woods sufficiently to secure them from observation, moved quickly down the side of the water. The night was fast settling around. The shadows of the woods projected far over the ice, and the lingering rays from the west were rapidly displaced by the gray tints, and these by black, till darkness enwrapped the whole landscape, excepting the dim outline line to be traced by the light of the stars that now shone bright in the clear cold sky. A rapid walk brought them soon to the spot where Sibley had concealed his men; and Sibley himself, who was on the lookout in the advance, stepped from behind the trunk of a huge pine to welcome them back.</p> 
               <p>"Well, what news?"</p> 
               <p>The result of the reconnoitring was soon detailed. Succobash joined his comrades, while Joe, Butler, and Wishcomet carefully reviewed the ground and the arrangement that had been made. A cove of nearly triangular shape ran up about a quarter of a mile into the land. A brook which drained a series of swamps entered its upper extremity. The banks on either side, were bold, and swelled, at a very short distance from the water, into wooded "horsebacks," or long narrow hills, until they reached the mouth of the brook; where they diverged again from each other, and melted into rolling highlands inclosing a succession of swamps, thickly wooded with the white cedar and hacmatack, and fringed with thickets of alder.</p> 
               <p>"There, Butler, there's the island, you see, that I told you of, jest off the mouth of the cove. Now the moon will be up in two hours, and the lake be as light as day. When those chaps move, they'll keep the woods on t'other side as long as they can. Now to, cross at the outlet below will take 'em too far down. They must come across behind the island. But when they get into the cove, where'll they land? That's the question."</p> 
               <p>"Why, Joe, for the very same reason that they keep in the shadow of the island, they will strike directly over to the south shore of the cove, and take the woods there."</p> 
               <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6274-00000170"/> 
               <p>"You're right, James. An't it so, Wishcomet?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," replied the chief."</p> 
               <p>"Then the men must be posted differently; now let's settle that. We want to cut 'em off from a chance to retreat up the lake again."</p> 
               <p>"I see but one way to do that. Let eight or ten of the men hide down in this little hollow, just over the bank. A sentry or two must be kept on the watch here. When the Indians have passed off the lake, they must hang on their rear. Meanwhile we must ambush the rest, as nearly as we can judge, upon the line they will follow. That will probably be either on the side of the horseback or up the swamp upon the ice. If the men are put over the south side of the hill, we shall have them in flank and rear."</p> 
               <p>"Can't do better, Butler. That'll fix 'em, I guess."</p> 
               <p>"There's one thing more, Joe. Can't we contrive some way to trap the lot of them. If we attack them, we shall have to fight it out till most of them are shot down, and probably some of us too. Now, if we could capture the poor devils, take away their guns, and send them home with a good scaring, it will be better than killing half of them, won't it?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I suppose it will, James," replied Sibley, in a doubtful and disappointed tone. "But blast their skins! I've got all ready to fight 'em, and it's a darned pity to have so much trouble for nothing. The boys won't like it nohow."</p> 
               <p>"I'm afraid they won't, Joe. But I can coax them. The worst of the matter is that I don't see exactly how to manage the Indians. It's something like drawing a wolfs teeth. I must think about it; and meanwhile we must post the men. If you will take command of the main body, I'll watch here with Wishcomet and Succobash and four or five more. But I must have good stuff with me here. There'll be no backing but for us."</p> 
               <p>"Well, take your pick. I'll take charge of the rest, if you say so."</p> 
               <p>They now proceeded to the spot where Joe had left his band, and after careful examination of the formation of the land, established them in a dense growth in the hollow behind the horseback ridge that skirted the south side of the swamp. Butler then selected six men, and returned with them and his two Indian companions to the northern point of the cove. Here he placed his white comrades in the well screened, wooded hollow, and sent Succobash a few rods up the shore of the lake to watch the approach of the enemy, while himself and Wishcomet occupied a carefully concealed post of observation, near the extreme point of the cove, for the same purpose. Just upon the extremity of the bank, a compact clump of small firs ran, like a screen, for a rod or two on the edge of the forest. Behind this green parapet Butler and the Sachem seated themselves upon a fallen trunk, alternately rising to look abroad, and whiling away the time in whispered conversation.</p> 
               <p>The last faint reflection from the western sky had long vanished, and darkness and silence had taken joint possession of the woods. The tall trunks of the trees arose, dimly visible for a few paces around the watchers; but, above and around, at a little distance all was visionless and black, except that here and there a star might be seen twinkling through the tree-tops in the far-off sky. The gentle night-breeze swept over the surface of the forest with its deep, mysterious moanings. Other sight or sound there was none; as<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6274-00000171"/> if the little spot occupied by the sentinels were taken out of the world of man and enveloped with the original darkness of chaos. The snow-covered ground at their feet gave forth a feeble reflection; and the stars diffused a dull leaden hue over the ice, out upon the lake. The snow glimmered upon and sharply defined the edge of the opposite shore, and the line of trees was traced dimly against the sky.</p> 
               <p>"Wishcomet," said Butler, "I have been thinking how to manage this matter without so much bloodshed; and I can contrive but one way, and that is rather hazardous. Can you speak Iroquois?"</p> 
               <p>"Very little; but Succobash does pretty well."</p> 
               <p>'Then I think I can manage it. But it will be a nice affair. I can't do it without you. Succobash, go ask Sibley to come here. Mind you go round on the ice; it won't do to have the ground tracked up like a cow-yard."</p> 
               <p>Succobash soon performed his errand, and Sibley returned with him.</p> 
               <p>"Joe, were you careful to make no tracks about, that would tell tales?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes. I an't so simple as not to look arter that, when it comes to trappin' Indians. We made but one print comin' down the ridge; and then I kept the men on the hard ice yonder, till we moved off to our ambush. We all trod in one track too, till we got down into the holler. The crust on this snow is e'en a'most as hard as ice; and I know 'twould puzzle old Nick to tell much by the trail. I hardly think you can see it by moonlight. We've all got moccasins on."</p> 
               <p>"Well, so far good. Now hear my plan."</p> 
               <p>Butler then detailed his scheme to his companions. We shall leave it to develop itself in the course of events. After full explanation, and various objections raised by Sibley and provided for by Butler, Joe gave a rather reluctant assent, and prepared to return to his post.</p> 
               <p>"Well, James, if you will have it so, you must; and we'll try to do our part. But why can't you let all take their chance together? I shall be all-fired sorry if it don't work well, and you get into trouble."</p> 
               <p>"O, never worry, Joe. The Sachem and I can both either run or fight, as well as most men; and it he will venture it, I will. I was obliged to kill one of these fellows yesterday; and if I can get the upper hand of the rest, and yet save their lives, I think I shall sleep the better for it."</p> 
               <p>"Well, be darned keerful. It an't no boys' play."</p> 
               <p>"I know that very well. But we'll try it when the moon gets well up."</p> 
               <p>The discussion over, Sibley went down again into the swamp with Succobash, and, as they went along, suggested certain propositions to the Indian that elicited from him an expression of earnest concurrence. But we shall not, at present, betray their confidence. They rejoined the main body, and the arrangements required to meet Butler's plan were made with silent promptitude.</p> 
               <p>Soon after James and Wishcomet were left alone, the hour at which the moon rose, arrived. A faint tinge showed itself upon the eastern sky, brightening into a halo of silvery light that continually widened into a larger semicircle, and deepened, at its centre, with a rosy refulgence, from which at last shot forth scattered rays that glittered on the tops of the highest trees, and lighted up point after point of every projecting object; as if shaded lamps were suddenly hung about the<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6274-00000172"/> woods. In a few moments more, the mellow and soft radiance, overtopping the deep screen behind which it had been veiled, threw strong patches of illumination upward upon every salient point. The outlines of the trees became visible, as if they had actually grown out of chaos before the eye; and the shadows crept away into the deep recesses. Light diffused itself fast over the open expanse of the lake; and the scene, which intense darkness had seemed to annihilate, was reconstructed, as by a magic that breathed over it a fairy atmosphere of light and shade, far more beautiful than the harsher outlines and distincter characters of day.</p> 
               <p>In about an hour, the moon rode in the blue sky far above the loftiest tree-tops; and the whole landscape received, through the transparent atmosphere of the March night, the full power of her rays. Every particle of moisture, set free by the warmth of the sun during the previous day, was congealed in frost-work that sparkled with a tremulous reflection of witching delicacy and beauty. The deep bosom of the woods still held masses of shadow, rendered all the darker by the intense contrast, until the scenery seemed a magnificent panorama, carved of ebony and chased and frosted with glittering silver. A clear reflection glimmered up from the surface of the ice, and spread a gauzy veil over the lower zone of the prospect, that softened even while it brightened its general tone. But the upper air was lucid and serene, as if mist or cloud could never dim its purity; and the more luminous stars and planets shone through its blue depths, scarcely shorn of a ray by the brilliancy of the glorious moonlight.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head> 
               <p>BUTLER and the chief sat for another hour; then they arose, examined the priming of their guns, and started upon their expedition up the shore of the lake. Retiring into the depths of the woods until safe from observation, they again turned their faces northward, and, in less than an hour, reached the little hillock from the top of which they had, at nightfall, reconnoitred the opposite side. Sheltering themselves once more behind the roots of the fallen tree, they sat down to gather breath for the perilous movement they now purposed to make, and to take a preliminary survey of the ground. Before them spread the sparkling ice; and on its further verge, the huge boulders arose in the distance before the mouth of the gully, throwing a heavy shadow upon the bright surface, and distinct as if the mile or more that intervened were but a rifle-shot. All was motionless and still, and the deep wall of bronzed shadow girt the opposite shore in a voiceless quiet, as if no animate life had any portion in its mysterious solitude.</p> 
               <p>"Now, Wishcomet, we must be wide awake. Yet we must not make too much display, or these fellows will suspect a trick, and our plan will fail. We must try to make them take us for two belated hunters on their way homeward, or we shall not get them to follow us into the ambuscade. If they doubt us, they will either lie still or make a rush for our scalps."</p> 
               <pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6274-00000173"/> 
               <p>"All we can do is to take the ice, as if we sought it for smooth walking, and go steadily down," replied the Sachem. "I think they will follow through the woods on the other shore. If they rush upon us, we must take to the bank again, and make a running fight among the trees."</p> 
               <p>"Well, we'll start in a few minutes, and take our chance."</p> 
               <p>This short consultation terminated, they turned again to vigilant watch of the hostile quarter. Before they had been thus employed more than a minute or two, they heard the hoot of an owl breaking the death-like stillness, apparently near the angle of the lake on their own side and just above them. The guttural whoop rang through the air with a startling distinctness; then all was silent again.</p> 
               <p>"Hush, Butler," whispered the chief, and, after waiting a moment, added, "only one whoop. That bird was frightened from his perch. He isn't calling to his mate. There's something in the woods above on our side. We must either hide or go back."</p> 
               <p>"I can't give it up yet, Sachem, if you will stand by me. Let us hide here and see a little further into it."</p> 
               <p>"Very good; what you do, I do."</p> 
               <p>The fallen tree was one of a group of huge hemlocks, whose clustered foliage threw a deep gloom over the earth beneath them. Several scattered young evergreens fringed the landward side of the hillock, so that the whole summit lay in almost impenetrable shadow. The upturning of the vast mass of roots had raised with it the surface of the soil, so as to leave a large hollow which the snow had not entirely filled up. Butler and Wishcomet stretched themselves at full length in the bowl-like concavity; one of them watching the lake, the other looking up the shore. Directly a rustling was heard among the bushes in a thick swamp just above them; and a large bear, rushing out of the thicket, shambled off at a smart trot across the ice.</p> 
               <p>"See," whispered the chief, "there is a party coming down this shore. The bear tells us that plain enough."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and if they don't spy us out, he will tell us too whether there is anything going on, on t'other side. If they're moving too, he'll give 'em a wide berth, and make down the lake, instead of taking the woods again. We must be quiet now for our lives. Put your foot against mine, that we may be able to give each other notice without speaking."</p> 
               <p>A moment or two now passed in perfect quiet, when a slight push of Butler's foot apprised his companion that he discovered fresh signs of interruption. Six Indians emerged from the swamp, held their way in single file past the hill, and disappeared in the woods beyond them.</p> 
               <p>When they were fairly out of sight, Butler whispered his comrade, "Six of them, Wishcomet. What does the bear say?"</p> 
               <p>"He's afraid to land, and keeps down the lake."</p> 
               <p>"That settles everything then, Sachem. They're going down the lake on each side, in two parties. Mighty careful, an't they? Our plan is blown up sky-high; and I hardly know what to do. Do you think the scamps on this side will find our trail and try to hunt us up? Fortunately, they passed higher up the slope just here, and did not cross it."</p> 
               <p>"'Twill not be easy to see in the woods at night,<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6274-00000174"/> on this hard crust. If they don't come directly upon it, they won't discover it. If they do, they'll turn upon us."</p> 
               <p>"Well, we must take our chance of that. Let's follow them down now carefully. They're between us and our party; and the nearer we get without their knowing it, the better for us. We shall be ready to fall on their rear when Joe pitches into them. And, if they turn upon us, the nearer we are to our friends, the sooner we shall have help. What do you think, Sachem?"</p> 
               <p>"We can do nothing else now. We must keep as near the bank as we can. If they follow our trail back, they may pass us again, as they did just now, if we are careful."</p> 
               <p>"True, let's start now. They're a quarter of a mile ahead of us, by this time. You lead, for you can see sharper than I; and if they should chance to catch a glimpse of you, they may take you for one of themselves."</p> 
               <p>The young chief rose, and, followed by Butler, retraced the course towards the foot of the lake again. Singling out in his front some large tree or thick bush, from which he could safely examine the ground in advance, he proceeded rapidly up to the shelter, and there halted till he had satisfied himself that all was clear for another movement. In this way he passed about half the distance, Butler following his motions about a rod in the rear.</p> 
               <p>They now stood upon the upper edge of a smooth slope, covered with a glade of heavy timber. Wishcomet had halted to reconnoitre, upon the line where it opened upon a little valley thick with undergrowth, beyond which rose a rounded ridge. Here the quick eye of the chief caught sight of a human figure, just as it vanished among the alders; and, in a moment, an Iroquois came up the slope directly upon him. He had found time to warn Butler, by a motion of his arm, to conceal himself behind a large pine, by the side of which he was awaiting the Sachem's farther proceedings. Concealment on his own part was, however, impossible; for the Indian advanced precisely to the root of the tree beside which he stood. The Sachem immediately turned, and, stepping boldly out, took the same direction as that of the new-comer, and, casting his head downward, appeared to be carefully examining the ground as he went along. The stranger Indian started, as he first discovered the chief, and instantly drew an arrow to his ear. But without taking any notice of his hostile attitude, Wishcomet spoke to him in his own tongue: "There's no trail between here and the lake. Go up higher on the ridge."</p> 
               <p>As he uttered these words, he waved his hand towards the interior of the forest, pretending himself to assume a course nearly parallel. The Iroquois was puzzled and deceived for a moment by the cool and ready ruse. He lowered his bow, detached the arrow from the string, and took a few steps in the direction suggested; but, pausing once more, he eagerly examined, by the dim light, the figure of the chief. This more careful scrutiny failing to satisfy his doubts, he slackened his pace in order, by bringing himself more into the rear, to be able to attack the object of his suspicions with greater certainty and security. But Wishcomet, while seemingly intent upon the ground, narrowly watched all his motions, and saw that he was suspected, and must be detected, sooner or later, in the attempted imposition. He gently detached his blanket<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6274-00000175"/> from his girdle, and gathered it upon his left arm; then, drawing his hunting-knife and letting his rifle drop, he turned and sprang like a tiger upon his insidious companion. The leap of the Sachem was of almost incredible extent and speed; but the necessity of turning diminished both its celerity and force. He mastered the arms of his antagonist, but could not succeed in throwing the blanket over his head without a short but desperate struggle, during which an exclamation of surprise and fear escaped from the Iroquois, which attracted the attention of other ears. Butler was anxiously watching these manuvres, and, seeing the result, rushed to the assistance of his friend. Coming up behind the Iroquois, he forced the blanket over his head, and, tripping up his feet, laid him prostrate on the ground. The Sachem, now kneeling upon his overthrown foe, attempted, with Butler's assistance, to fetter and gag him, so that he might be safely left for the present, till matters still more important could be decided. He was yet occupied in binding his arms, which were firmly compressed in James's powerful grasp, with his own bowstring, when, suddenly raising his head, he listened attentively for an instant, and then buried his knife to the very hilt in the Indian's bosom and sprang to his feet. Snatching up his blanket, he gave a word of warning to Butler, and both picked up their rifles and darted behind the nearest trees. Several arrows whistled over their heads, as they glided behind the sheltering trunks, but neither of them was touched.</p> 
               <p>By peering cautiously from behind their cover through the twilight of the forest, they soon ascertained that the five remaining Iroquois, of the band that had passed them on the hill, were watching them from behind hind the trees in their front. Two of them were armed with guns; but neither side seemed to desire to give the alarm by a discharge. But, on the slightest exposure of a face or limb by Butler or his comrade, the hiss of an arrow admonished them of the necessity of the utmost caution. For some minutes the hostile parties observed each other with the utmost vigilance. But soon the outermost of the Iroquois were seen to steal forward from tree to tree, with a view to outflank the weaker party and command their rear. James and Wishcomet had agreed to avoid firing, except in the last extremity; as the alarm so given would necessarily derange the plan according to which their friends below had been stationed. The occasional show of the muzzles of their rifles, however, hinted broadly to their enemies to be careful in their motions, and had the effect to render the attempted manuvre one of slow and difficult execution. The instant a dusky form on either side was seen to quit its cover, the menacing barrel was thrust forth as if ready to pour out its deadly fire, and generally awed back the encroaching assailants. Little by little, nevertheless, the extremes of the attacking line assumed the shape of a crescent, whose threatening horns would before long be sufficiently protruded to expose the besieged occupants of the centre to attack on both sides, without a possibility of shelter. Slowly and reluctantly the two companions withdrew from cover to cover, as their active opponents, dodging from point to point, made their posts untenable, until they stood upon the verge of the bank, and further retreat was out of the question.</p> 
               <p>"Butler," whispered the chief, "we must either fire or make a run upon the ice."</p> 
               <p>"That last will never do, Wishcomet. We should<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6274-00000176"/> be shot down like rats. When worst comes to worst, we must fire. But look out to the left here, Sachem, on my side. Don't you see another Indian stealing up behind this devil that's working up along side of me? How queerly he manuvres!"</p> 
               <p>"I see him, and I see the shadow of another on this side, creeping up in the same way."</p> 
               <p>Anxiously the two now watched the motions in their front, and with especial interest the singular proceedings of the additional actors in the skirmish. These last had flitted from trunk to trunk, till now they stood respectively at the back of the second man from either end of the curved line of the Iroquois warriors, where they carefully concealed themselves, each behind his tree.</p> 
               <p>Butler and his comrade now gazed in breathless suspense, straining their vision to gather through the dim-vistas of the forest some indication of the intentions of the mysterious pair. They did not appear to belong to the hostile party, for they seemed carefully to conceal their approach from them. But to discover their character or design, in that dusky silence, was beyond the power of human senses. Conjectures of various sorts passed rapidly through their excited minds, but no probable solution yet appeared. The new-comers, however, remained but a few moments in their cover behind the Iroquois, although it seemed a long and tedious interval to the eager and wrought-up expectations of Butler and the young chief. Swiftly and quietly each stepped around his tree, an arm of each was dimly seen to rise into the air, and the two Indians, towards whom they had stridden, fell heavily to the ground. Their three remaining companions turned at the noise of their fall; and the besieged pair were soon convinced that, whoever the strangers might be, they were at any rate no friends to the besiegers. All doubt was soon removed; for the cheery voice of Sibley said aloud, "Now, Butler, knock out the brains of that varmint on your left. Wishcomet, take care of the chap next to you. We'll settle this 'ere feller in the middle."Even while he was speaking, Succobash, who was the other new actor in the scene, sprung upon the thunder-struck Iroquois, who was yet striving to understand what had so strangely altered the face of affairs, and mastered him before he could raise an arm. A groan and another fall upon the snow told that the keen knife had effectually done its work.</p> 
               <p>Butler and Wishcomet had, at the same instant, rushed upon the assailants of their flanks. The suddenness of the attack and the speedy and fearful fate of their companions left them but small disposition for further contest; and both turned and fled. But their opponents were young and nimble. Succobash and Sibley, having nothing now upon their hands,' joined in the chase, one to either side. The fugitives were soon overtaken, disarmed, and, bound; and the four victors returned to the bloody battle-ground, leading their sullen, but unresisting prisoners between them.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head> 
               <p>"WELL, James, I'm mighty glad that Succobash and I took it into our heads to look arter you a little, as things has turned out. I didn't dare say anything when I left you, for fear you'd be riled. I know'd you and Wishcomet are both hard customers; but 'twas a pokerish job. I felt everlastin' consarned about you, and Succobash here was just as bad about the Governor."</p> 
               <p>"I certainly shan't make any complaints about it now, Joe; and a better friend than you, in a hard pinch, I don't want to see. Those scamps had got the Sachem and me into a tight corner, as plain as daylight. But we mustn't stop to talk now. The rest of the Iroquois are moving down on the other side, and will reach the cove before us, if we don't look out sharp. Here's four of the poor devils that'll do no more harm. I wish to heaven the rest of 'em would run off. I've seen butchery enough now."</p> 
               <p>"Faith, so have I; but where's the four?"</p> 
               <p>"There's one out yonder. The Sachem and I were tying him, when the rest of 'em attacked us, and Wishcomet was obliged to stab him. He lies just beyond that big red pine."</p> 
               <p>"What shall we do with these two live beauties here? Wishcomet, I don't see what you Indians want to paint yourselves up like striped squirrels for. You're pretty good-lookin' fellers naterally."</p> 
                
               <p>"What does Captain Dee cover his head all over with flour for?" replied the young chief, smiling.</p> 
               <p>"Sure enough. We've all got our silly ways, that's a fact. But we mustn't stand chattering here. Succobash, pick up these fellers' guns; I suppose you'll want their scalps into the bargain; but them articles an't in my line. Break up all the bows and arrows you can find too. On the whole, you and the Governor had better keep a good one and some arrows, apiece. We may be glad to have something to shoot with that won't make a noise. I don't know no more about bows and arrows myself than a yaller dog."</p> 
               <p>Succobash performed the commission assigned him, and came back with the two guns and his belt stuck full of knives and hatchets, and with a bow and arrows also for himself and his chief. Wishcomet placed the two prisoners between himself and Succobash, with an intimation that instant death would be the reward of any attempt at escape. James and Sibley followed close behind, carrying their own and the captured fire-arms.</p> 
               <p>As they went along, they imparted to each other, in a low voice, their doings on both sides. We already know what had befallen Butler and his companion. Sibley gave an account of his own adventures as follows:-</p> 
               <p>"Well, you see, Succobash and I concluded to foller out a piece, so as to be on hand, if things went hard with you; and arter you'd been gone a matter of half an hour, we made tracks arter you. We travelled up to hereabouts, and then sot still in some bushes. Pretty soon we heard a deer snort and break away not far off, and judged somebody was stirrin'. So we started, and soon got sight of six Indians. Jest as we<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6274-00000178"/> made 'em out, they was runnin' round a-lookin' up your tracks; and arter something of a talk, they turned about and pushed up the shore agin. It didn't take us long to cipher that out; so we pulled foot arter 'em. The rest you know all about."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and I shan't forget it, Joe. I'll do as much for you, if I have the chance."</p> 
               <p>"I'll bet you will. But we're close to the boys now. You and I had better go first; for they won't know what to make of all these Indians. Jest as like as not they'll fire into 'em."</p> 
               <p>Accordingly Butler and Sibley went to the front, and shortly exchanged greetings with the sentry at the north side of the cove. They were here informed that the Iroquois had come down on the other side of the lake, and were hidden in the woods on the island, where they had remained quiet for some time. It was evident, on comparing observations, that they were awaiting the arrival of the party that had been sent down the western shore; with a view undoubtedly of making sure that no danger should be threatening them from behind, before they started on their expedition. A hurried council was now held, to decide how best to meet this new state of things. Wishcomet, Butler, and Sibley soon arranged their plans; and James gave directions accordingly.</p> 
               <p>"Succobash, bring the prisoners this way." The two Iroquois were brought into the midst of the assemblage, each guarded by a man on either side, with drawn knife and loaded rifle. Through the medium of Succobash, as interpreter, James endeavored to effect an understanding with them, by which all further difficulty might be avoided.</p> 
               <p>"We are a large party," he said. "You don't see here a man for every four of us. You can't escape, nor can your friends out yonder. Now if you will speak to them to come in and give us up their arms, we will let you all go safe and unhurt home. If you keep yourselves in your own country henceforth, we shall never trouble you; but if we catch you lurking round here again, we will shoot you like dogs."</p> 
               <p>Succobash repeated this proposition to the captives in their native tongue. But, whether from distrust of Butler's good faith or from sullenness, no reply whatever could be elicited. They stood, like dark statues, impassive and motionless. Not even a glance was vouchsafed to the speakers; and their features remained as vacant and listless as if they neither saw nor heard what passed around them.</p> 
               <p>"D--n 'em, Butler," said Sibley. "It's no use to talk to 'em. You might as well try to make a bargain with a wolf; and they feel jest about as peaceable. I'll try my hand with 'em."</p> 
               <p>Sibley turned and spoke a few words to two of the men behind him, who instantly drew their knives and planted themselves each over one of the prisoners, holding the glittering blades ready to be buried, at a word, in their naked bosoms.</p> 
               <p>"Now tell 'em, Succobash, that if they don't do this 'ere message right off, in good shape too, we'll make minced meat of 'em."</p> 
               <p>The threatening announcement was faithfully repeated; but it failed as utterly as the peaceful tender of Butler. The menace was, met with perfect stoicism. Not a muscle quivered, not an eyelash winked, not a sound was heard. Wishcomet, who was leaning, a silent spectator, against a neighboring pine, smiled with apparent satisfaction at the failure of Joe's experiment.</p> 
               <pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6274-00000179"/> 
               <p>"Sibley," said he, "you can't frighten any more than coax them. I and Succobash will manage all this. Place your men so as to surround this cove as much as possible. I will undertake to brin those upon the island into the very middle of the ice. Then, when I give the signal, let every man show himself, and push in as fast as possible; and take care to throw men enough well forward to close the mouth of the cove when the time comes."</p> 
               <p>"Why, Wishcomet, you'll get into a worse scrape than you did up yonder. I should think you'd larned a better lesson there. The minute they see into the trick, you'll have a dozen knives into you, d'ye see?"</p> 
               <p>"I shall do as well as I did then, if you will do as much on your part. Just let me arrange everything, and it will all go right."</p> 
               <p>The Sachem now threw off his own blanket, and put over his shoulders one taken by his follower from the dead Indians, and also pulled the eagle's feather from his cap.</p> 
               <p>"Now, Sibley, pick out two men that never miss a shot, and put them behind that bunch of bushes on the shore."</p> 
               <p>"Here, Tom Bray and Robert Campbell, take up your guns and go with the Governor. If those boys won't, either of 'em, hit a dollar ten times runnin' as far as they can see it, I hope they'll never see another one. Tell what you want, and they'll do it, if it's possible with powder and ball."</p> 
               <p>The chief now bade the marksmen creep cautiously behind the covert, and carefully to watch the course of things. "If you see that Succobash and I can't clear ourselves, you must shoot down those that press us hardest, and don't make any mistakes. Now, Sibley, have these two prisoners fettered so that they can barely walk. They must help us, whether they will or no."</p> 
               <p>The legs of the Iroquois were now fettered with gun-slings, in such a manner, as to render walking difficult and any more rapid motion impossible. All being now prepared, the Sachem, explaining to Butler his whole scheme and cautioning him to place his men as speedily as might be, moved off with Sibley. Succobash, the two Iroquois, and four of the other men. He halted near the head of the cove, where a little point jutted conspicuously a few feet out from the shore. Succobash also brought up four of the Passamaquoddies that had remained with the ambush on the other side. The plan was then detailed, and each instructed in his part. The two Iroquois were made to advance just out of the edge of the wood on to the shore, while two riflemen crouched behind the little point at their side, and two more stood behind the trees at their back. Two of Wishcomet's band lay also, knife in hand, among the bushes close to their feet. The Sachem then, after addressing a few stern words to the prisoners, in the Iroquois dialect, as he passed them, moved boldly out into the lake, with Succobash at his side and his two other comrades close in the rear. The four proceeded steadily till they reached the midway of the length of the cove. Here the chief signed to his followers behind to halt; while himself and Succobash continued on a few rods farther toward the island. An Indian was soon seen cautiously emerging from its shore, to whom Wishcomet made a gesture to advance, and himself remained stationary upon the ice. Directly thirteen Iroquois appeared, one after the other, upon the edge of the island, and, not doubting<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6274-00000180"/> that they saw their six companions from the western side of the lake scattered up and down the cove before them, immediately set out to join them. The Sachem stopped for a moment or two, till he saw them safely on the road, then, turning again, he and Succobash sauntered slowly towards their friends at the centre of the cove, and halted a moment as if awaiting to be overtaken by the main band. When they reached this point, the Iroquois were still many rods off; and the whole four turned again to the rear, and walked slowly towards the head of the recess. The Iroquois were lured far up the bay by this skillful manuvre; and the Passamaquoddies had approached within a short distance of the spot where the captives stood, watched by their invisible jailers.</p> 
               <p>The Sachem, aware that the deception could not be sustained much longer, now faced about once more, and stepped forward till he met, face to face, the leader of the Indian files. So completely had these plausible movements imposed upon their distrustful sagacity, that the Iroquois chief started to find that a stranger stood before him. Instinctively he advanced his rifle, and drew a hatchet from his belt. But Wishcomet, making a calm gesture to refrain, dropped the butt of his own rifle to the ice at his feet, and spoke in the Iroquois tongue:-</p> 
               <p>"Why do you come from the waters of the St. Lawrence to prowl on the shores of the ocean? These are not the Iroquois hunting-grounds."</p> 
               <p>"Cannot my brother spare us a little venison?" returned the Iroquois, in the true spirit of Indian evasion and caution.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, but we don't like to feed wolves that steal sheep and bite. My brother has come for bad purposes poses, but he is caught in his own trap. It will be better for him to give us up his guns, and he shall go home this time unhurt; but he must not come so far from home again."</p> 
               <p>The hostile leader now began to distrust his position. His eager glances wandered stealthily from shore to shore, but he gathered no information from the survey. His eye flashed with ill-suppressed enmity, and every gesture showed that he burned to attack the Sachem and his little party; but the dignity and quiet fearlessness of the young chief daunted him. He therefore sought, before coming to extremities, to ascertain a little better the circumstances by which he was surrounded, and which were, thus far, apparently so different from his expectations.</p> 
               <p>"Why should my men give up their arms?" he rejoined.</p> 
               <p>"Because, if they do not, they will be taken from them, <emph>dead or alive,</emph>" was the quiet reply.</p> 
               <p>"Can you four take them from us?"</p> 
               <p>"Forty good rifles are leveled at you from the woods, Chief," said Wishcomet. "At a wave of my hand, the men that carry them will be around you. Take my counsel, while you have time."</p> 
               <p>"Who is it tells Poconet to be afraid?"</p> 
               <p>"I am Wishcomet, Sachem of the Passamaquoddies."</p> 
               <p>"I, too, have men in the forest," pertinaciously answered the Iroquois, leader.</p> 
               <p>"The six men who came down on this side cannot help their chief now."</p> 
               <p>"Why not? They are faithful and strong."</p> 
               <p>"They cannot break the bands that hold them."</p> 
               <p>"Does not Wishcomet dare tell me where my young men are, or doesn't he know?"</p> 
               <pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6274-00000181"/> 
               <p>"Wishcomet knows what he says; and what he says is true. Yonder are two of them: call them, and see if they can come to you."</p> 
               <p>The Iroquois warriors had now clustered in a semicircle about their leader, in their anxiety to see and hear what was passing. Impatience and ill blood began to get the better of discretion. Moody brows and angry eyes were bent from all quarters upon the Sachem and his three followers. At length the foremost clutched their knives, and raised their guns and bows to a position for ready use. Poconet himself stood, dark and sullen, like a wolf at bay, longing to spring, yet hardly daring the venture.</p> 
               <p>Wishcomet observed the growing commotion, and, stepping back a pace, he trailed the butt of his rifle across the ice, and coolly said, "Let nobody cross that line; we can hear each other very well." Hardly had he spoken, when, either from chance or with the design of bringing on the fray, a stout and savage-looking Iroquois stepped forward close to the side of the Sachem, with a hatchet in his hand. The young chief seized him by the shoulder, and pushed him roughly again beyond the limit. The aggression and its repulse both served but to add fuel to the rising flame; and every hostile savage made ready for an onset. Their chief again brandished his hatchet, and growled out in scornful wrath,-</p> 
               <p>"An Iroquois has crossed the line, and he is not dead, we will all try."</p> 
               <p>"Stop but one moment," replied the young Passamaquoddy; and again his firm and commanding tone awed into momentary quiet the boiling passions and brandished weapons around him. "If you will not believe me, see for yourselves."</p> 
                
               <p>As he spoke, he raised his right arm into the air, and then pointed his finger at the intruder, who still stood a few feet in advance of his fellows. Instantly a ball hissed over the ice, the crack of a rifle rang upon the air; and the offending Iroquois sprang upwards with a howl, and dropped lifeless at their feet.</p> 
               <p>A yell of dismay and vengeance at once burst forth from the whole band; and their chief sprang furiously at Wishcomet, while the rest poured tumultuously after him. But again a rifle-shot flashed along the mark upon the ice, and one of the foremost assailants fell dead. Poconet had, however, leaped beyond the rest, and attacked the Sachem with deadly animosity. But this second retribution for their presumption abashed his followers; and they hung back instinctively from the fatal boundary; while Succobash and his comrades pressed to the side of their young chief and leveled their guns full in the eyes of the assailants. Wishcomet was ready to meet his antagonist; and, seizing his uplifted arm firmly in his own right hand, he checked his career; and the two stood motionless, face to face.</p> 
               <p>"No firing, Succobash, till I order." Then, looking his infuriated enemy coolly in the eye, he said to him:-</p> 
               <p>"Does Poconet think his warriors are not worth saving? How can they run away from these rifle-balls? Tell your men to lay down their arms."</p> 
               <p>"Never!" shouted the maddened savage, making once more a desperate attempt to liberate his arm and complete his blow. His adversary was, however, both sinewy and active; and still retaining his hold upon the uplifted limb of the Iroquois with, one arm, he dexterously twirled him round with the other, so as to<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6274-00000182"/> throw him between himself and the faithful Succobash, by whose aid he was quickly stripped of hatchet and gun, and put entirely in the power of his opponents. This disaster of their chieftain and the address, strength, and daring of the Sachem, with the ready rifles of his men, kept the mass of the Iroquois still in check. Wishcomet profited by the temporary lull to make one more appeal to considerations of prudence.</p> 
               <p>"Look, Chief!" said he; and once more he raised his left arm above his head, and swung his cap in the air. Before it fell to his side again, from behind rock, tree, and bush sprang out armed men, on right and left, in front and rear.</p> 
               <p>"Listen, Chief!" he added, as the loud hurra rang round the cove, as, man after man, they stepped out from their covers. Butler's commanding voice, Sibley's deep shout, and the answering responses of the Dees and other leaders filled every corner of the shores with rapidly uttered orders. With trailed rifles, all rushed at full speed, in rapidly converging lines, upon the central groups. Before subsiding astonishment gave room for resistance, a circle of deadly barrels hedged round the devoted band of Iroquois; and every instant it narrowed its intervals, as fresh men came up, and the whole ring contracted, as it closed upon the central point.</p> 
               <p>"Now, Chief, are you satisfied?" said "Wishcomet. But Poconet neither answered nor stirred. Livid with rage and mortification, he stood like a human effigy of Satan, sulky, obdurate, and malignant. Butler, Sibley, the Dees, and others instantly pushed to the Sachem's side, as they came up; and resistance, either within or without, was now utterly hopeless. Quitting his disarmed and sullen rival, the young chief called Succobash, Sibley, and two or three more to his aid; and the weapons were taken from the hands and belts of the Iroquois without opposition, and piled up under the guard of their own men.</p> 
               <p>"Now, boys, our work is done," cried Butler. We've pulled their teeth; now let nobody disgrace himself by harming defenceless men. Sachem, tell Succobash to let them know that their lives are safe, if they take themselves right off home. If we catch them this way again, we'll hunt them down like wolves."</p> 
               <p>"Succobash, put that last matter to 'em strong," added Sibley, "or they'll be for opening another score. They don't look particularly grateful."</p> 
               <p>Succobash now explained the conditions of their release to the captives; and the ring was opened for their departure. Sam Shirk, who stood at the gap, begged hard for the privilege of a kick at each one as he passed out; but his request was imperatively negatived, even when reduced to the moderate demand of a kick "at that 'tarnal old sinner of a chief." He was obliged, therefore, to content himself with making up a face at him, expressive of his unutterable contempt. But the impassive savage deigned him not even a look, as he moodily stalked after his dejected band.</p> 
               <p>"You might as well try to grin the weather-cock off of the meeting-house, Sam," said Tom Bray; "that feller's worse than a bear with a sore head."</p> 
               <p>A small patrol followed after the retiring enemy, and watched them across the lake, till they were hidden in the woods on its northern border. The victors then took up their march for Sibley's house, to recruit their wearied frames with food and sleep after their<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6274-00000183"/> severe exertions, which had now been prolonged nearly twenty-four hours.</p> 
               <p>It was daybreak when they reached again the friendly roof, bringing with them the trophies of their victory. After a hasty refreshment and a few hours' sleep, all were aroused to a plentiful late breakfast, or more properly perhaps an early dinner, according to the social ideas of the time and place, preparatory to taking up their homeward march; for it was not till nearly noon that hunger and fatigue were so far abated as to make fresh exertion comfortable. After making the most of the rations brought with them, and such hospitable accompaniments as Mrs. Sibley's resources could supply, the party started to return to Merrifield. The day was in unison with their own exultant feelings, one of those bright, clear days of March, that come to bring grateful evidence of the termination of the stern reign of the northern winter. The rays of the, sun diffused, through the pure atmosphere, a warmth which the contrast with recent cold rendered almost oppressive. A slight snowfall in the early morning had covered the landscape about an inch in depth with its feathery deposit, the unsullied crystals of which flashed back the radiance of the brilliant sky, as from a bed of diamonds. A soft and glittering cushion rested upon every surface, diversifying the bare and brown limbs of the hard-wood trees and the deep masses of the evergreen foliage with a fairy mantle of the purest white; upon which the beams of the unclouded sun were reflected with a dazzling light, till the whole air shimmered with its sparkling lustre.</p> 
               <p>Lightly and joyfully the little band proceeded on their homeward route, their success marred by no painful reflections. Jokes and laughter, song and noisy frolic beguiled the road; and at dusk they were dismissed by Butler, at the entrance of the village, to their several homes.</p> 
               <p>Great was the rejoicing in Merrifield that evening. Fathers, brothers, and sons had returned in safety, danger and anxiety were dispelled, and all minds were disposed to enjoy the welcome news. Around many a blazing fire, the history of the expedition was recounted to an earnest group of listeners. But at last, when curiosity and excitement had subsided, light after light disappeared; till the quiet hamlet was left to the guardianship of the bright moon and the vigilance of the watch-dogs.</p> 
               <p>Morning brought with it, nevertheless, a still increasing stir and bustle. Immediately after breakfast, the corners and sunny sides of adjacent buildings were occupied by the chief part of the population, engaged in relating, listening, conjecturing, commenting, criticising, and all other possible modes of speculation,-if other there be,-upon matters such as then occupied all minds.</p> 
               <p>Sibley had accompanied the expedition down to Merrifield to enjoy his share of the glory and gossip. He was to be seen enthroned upon the top of an empty molasses hogshead, flanked by Shirk, who sat whittling the edge of the sugar-box which served him and two others for a seat. Around them was gathered the largest knot of loiterers; and even the grave Deacon Hardy stopped among them, for the better part of an hour, with pleased face, to gather up the often recounted details.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXV.</head> 
               <p>BUT good Dame Butler's mind dwelt little upon the military achievements that had just graced the annals of Merrifield. She had other cares, to which she gladly fled for refuge from the story of bloodshed and human perversity, which was to her peaceful soul as a thorn in the flesh, an irritating, painful, and altogether unwelcome intrusion. Turning a deaf ear to the glorifications of the community, and barring out, as far as she possibly could, all thought of transactions so utterly abominable and monstrous to her, she merged herself body and soul in the preparations for James's wedding. Lucky it was for her that she had a retreat, so entire and absorbing, from all external perplexities. Even without this fortuitous recommendation, the occasion would have concentrated and tasked to the uttermost all her energies. For not even when, in her youthful and undisturbed placidity, she had given herself into the arms of her own earthly destiny, long years ago, had she probably felt the intense interest that she did for the wedding of her only child. Then it was only her own quiet self that was concerned; now it was no less herself, but a reduplicated self. What was there, either of extant or possible, that could lure a thought of hers from an event so important, so dear to her heart, so deep in its significance to her self-secluded sphere! The fall of empires, floods, earthquakes, revolutions olutions would have fallen on her ears unheeded. Had the moon tumbled in upon the earth, it would hardly have disturbed her proceedings, provided it kept itself out of her own premises. Soon a stir was gotten up in the household that was wonderful to behold. The event produced in the family an effect like that of a revolution in the city of Paris. Even the shootings and bayonetings, the hangings up to lamp-posts, and such other little episodes, by which Frenchmen give zest and piquancy to their periodical amusements of this description, found a parallel in the wholesale murders committed on the occasion. The widow's atrocities, indeed, were confined to the brute creation; but the chickens that were guillotined, the pigs that were stabbed, the partridges that were shot, and the trout that were hung up by the gills might have satisfied the heart of a regular <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sans-culotte,</foreign> unless his content were marred by the insignificance of the game.</p> 
               <p>The inroads upon flour-barrels, sugar-boxes, and butter-firkins were enormous; for no coronation or lord mayor's feast ever awakened such an interest as did this occurrence, in the old lady's heart. James was her pride and glory; and if, in anything she fell short in the virtues of humility and abstraction from this world's objects, it was in his behalf. Mary's attractions and sweet womanly spirit, too, had made her only less dear than James to her genial affections.</p> 
               <p>The energies of the household itself, thus galvanized into excited activity, were fully competent to raise a very respectable hubbub. But the parties concerned were too well known and too generally esteemed not to call forth all the sympathies, and enlist in the service all the disposable force of the village. Every old maid and gossiping young damsel in Merrifield stood ready<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6274-00000185"/> to lend their aid; while the matrons, whose own cares limited the display of their good-will, were constantly popping in and out to taste, advise, suggest, or decide mooted points, like skirmishers about the line of the main battle.</p> 
               <p>An immense amount of cutting and clipping, sewing and stitching, finally exhausted the bales and packages that had been forwarded from Boston to James's order, in the unceasing manufacture of garments and house-keeping appliances. The day of sewing circles, for the supply of the babies in Africa with flannel waistcoats and like praiseworthy charities, had not yet dawned; and old and young were glad to amuse themselves by assisting Mary and the dame, stimulated partly by curiosity and by better motives as well.</p> 
               <p>Great was the confusion and din, the consultation, examination, criticism, and admiration; and the consumption of tea and doughnuts was prodigious. The tongues were as nimble as the needles, and some of them quite as sharp. Everything that had happened in the village from its settlement, everything that possibly could happen, and many things that never did and never would happen, were related, surmised, and discussed; and many an offender was tried and adjudged, with equal zeal as questions upon flounces and ribbons.</p> 
               <p>"For heaven's sake, Mary," said James, as he took up his cap one morning to escape from the turmoil, "when will you ever be done with this fuss? You have cooked enough to feed all Maine and old Massachusetts to boot, and sewed enough to clothe them; and yet I don't see that you are not as busy as ever."</p> 
               <p>"Why, James," said the widow, "you'd like to have things handsome at your wedding, wouldn't you?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Not a bit would I care, mother, if I have but you and Mary about me, and enough for our friends' comfort and our own. We've all our lives to eat and drink in; and I should think you meant that we should do it all up at once."</p> 
               <p>"Why, I'm sure, James, I don't see any harm done; and we don't have a wedding every day."</p> 
               <p>"No, mother, we don't. And I vow," replied James, laughing slyly at the blushing Mary, "I'll never be married again, if I live a thousand years."</p> 
               <p>"Well, my son, you shall do as you please about that," answered his mother, with grave simplicity; "but now I want you to let me have my way. As to being married a second, time, some think it's a good plan, and some don't. For my part, I never wanted to be," added she, wiping her eyes.</p> 
               <p>Butler affectionately kissed away the tear that was stealing down her cheek, as he replied, "You shall always have your way in my house, mother, saving Mary's rights; and you and she will have no difficulty in settling all that, I am sure. So, if you will promise to leave enough in the house to last us a week, I will take to the woods for further supplies; if we can do no better than live on venison and partridges."</p> 
               <p>Then kissing Mary too, who thereupon blushed more than ever, "in order," as he said, "to prove his perfect impartiality," he left the house clear for operations alike distasteful and incomprehensible to masculine minds.</p> 
               <p>The great wave of preparation at last passed its culmination; and its multitudinous waters subsided, as it were, into nooks and crannies and standing pools all about the premises. Nothing was left of them but, if we may use the figure to its end, the broken surf,-<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6274-00000186"/> that is to say, such matters as either from their nature could not be disposed of beforehand, or were too insignificant to cause especial care. Quantities of clothing and household chattels of every sort, with eatables almost enough to feed the army of Xerxes, had been prepared and carefully deposited in their various receptacles; and comparative quiet was restored.</p> 
               <p>But one source of uneasiness still remained. Butler had steadfastly refused to allow the carpet to be spread upon the floor of the large parlor in the new house, which, in a more aristocratic circle, would be called the drawing-room.</p> 
               <p>This strange and pertinacious whim had long furnished an eye-sore to the industrial zeal of the females, as well as a perplexing riddle to their curiosity. But James was neither to be moved by remonstrance from his determination, nor induced to give his reasons for it.</p> 
               <p>Mary had quietly given up the point, satisfied that, whatever those reasons might be, they were good and sufficient in his mind. But his mother had neither the acuteness to perceive the hopelessness of debating the question, nor the energy to put it aside from her thoughts; she could only fidget along in a despairing worry over this unseemly blank in the otherwise satisfactory prospect.</p> 
               <p>There were now but two days left before the wedding, and James had given no indication of yielding. The carpet still remained, in a roll wrapped in its tow-cloth cover, out in the shed where it had been placed on its first arrival. As the proceedings of the breakfast table, on that morning, drew towards conclusion, the careful old lady recommenced for the twentieth time an internal review of the field of operations, to make sure that nothing had been overlooked in the hubbub of preparation. Everything seemed right but the standing grievance of the carpet; which weighed upon her mind with such annoying prominence that, after revolving the vexation silently for some time, she could not resist the inclination to renew the attack on Jame's unaccountable perversity.</p> 
               <p>"Now, James, do you really mean to say that you won't have the carpet put down on the large room?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, dear mother, I have surely said so often enough to be understood," replied her son, with a laugh and a sly look at Mary.</p> 
               <p>"Well, you're just like your father. When he once said a thing, you might as well talk to the wind as try to alter him."</p> 
               <p>James looked amusedly at Mary again, and said, in a voice too low to reach his mother's ear, "That's the reason mother still keeps talking. I hope you will be wiser, Mary." The young lady returned the pressure of his hand which had gone in search of hers beneath the table, and rejoined with an answering smile, "Don't you see that I am so already?"</p> 
               <p>Not noticing this little episode, the good woman shambled along the path of her disturbed thoughts.</p> 
               <p>"Well, but how it will look! and then all the company will get their deaths with cold feet upon the bare floor."</p> 
               <p>"O no, mother, I have provided for all that. I'll warrant nobody's feet will be cold in that room."</p> 
               <p>Mary looked suddenly up with a prompt glance of unwelcome understanding, and exclaimed somewhat reproachfully, "O James!" But she said nothing more, and the old lady was altogether impervious to the intimation. Mary followed James, as he rose to<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6274-00000187"/> take his hat, and, closing the parlor door carefully behind her, placed her arm on his shoulder, and pleadingly repeated, "O James! please don't."</p> 
               <p>The young man looked fondly, and a little roguishly withal, at the handsome face that looked up so earnestly into his own; and first of all tried a prescription upon the rosy lips, that relieved the face very considerably of its air of chagrin.</p> 
               <p>"Don't what, Mary? Have you lost your confidence in my discretion already?"</p> 
               <p>"But your mother, James, will be troubled if you have dancing. You know what she thinks about it."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I know very well what she and most of our older neighbors think of it; and that is just the chief reason for my determination. Our young friends, you know, Mary, would enjoy a dance infinitely, for opportunities for a frolic are somewhat rare here; and I should be glad, if I could, to render everybody as happy as I am myself. But my special wish is to express emphatically my dissent from that morose relic of puritanical bigotry, which makes fools of the old people and hypocrites of the young ones. The boys and girls will dance and <emph>ought to dance</emph> together. You have brought upon yourself a long sermon, and I must make sure of my audience," added he, as he wound his arm round her waist and drew her closer to his side.</p> 
               <p>"Now, what is the result of all this? Simply that an innocent and proper pleasure is converted almost into the sinful indulgence that some foolishly think it, by investing it with a half-admitted sense of shame. The young folks are driven into corners and to the degradation of concealment, while the old are compelled to wink at what they can't help; and so the self-respect of both parties is insulted, as well as their mutual respect for each other.</p> 
               <p>"You remember, Mary, the spruce beer we used to make together, when we were children: it was a pleasant and healthful drink, wasn't it?"</p> 
               <p>"I used to think so certainly," replied Mary;" but what has the spruce beer to do with it?"</p> 
               <p>"Just this: You agree that the beer, with a due degree of fermentation, was both wholesome and agreeable. Now, you know that we used sometimes to undertake to put it up in bottles and cork it tight. The consequence often was that the corks were blown out, the bottles burst, and in the end it turned sour on our hands. Now, if you cork up the legitimate love of pleasure and the high spirits of the young, either the pressure will be thrown off or the bottles will be spoiled, and the natural and innocent feelings be turned sour. Now, a dance at our wedding will settle the question in Merrifield; and if we can put a little of the milk of human kindness into Deacon Hardy, instead of the vinegar, it will improve the old gentleman decidedly."</p> 
               <p>"I think you are right, James, about the beer and the dancing too; but still your mother, she will sink through the floor, when she hears a fiddle."</p> 
               <p>"I will prepare her for it in time, Mary. But it was not worth while to have her frizzling over such nonsense for a week. She will now see, for herself, that there's no immorality in an orderly dance, and that the devil don't creep into a fiddle-case half as often as into-well, I won't say what. Another reason for my silence is that I don't want the deacons holding a sanhedrim over the matter, to get up a fuss and a dispute. I want to settle the question before<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6274-00000188"/> they know it. Common sense and human nature will keep it settled safe enough. Don't you think that I am a good general?"</p> 
               <p>"I will wait till you've won the victory," replied Mary, laughing, "before I make up my mind."</p> 
               <p>"You little faithless one! Perhaps you'll desert to Deacon Hardy, in the heat of the battle. But I shall win the victory; and nobody will be hurt either. It's just as sure as that I love you dearly," he whispered; applying also at the same time, in support of his conclusion, another of those arguments so powerful with young lovers. Mary retreated, a trifle flurried, to her own occupations; and Butler went out with a smile of quiet satisfaction in his eye.</p> 
               <p>The important morning at length arrived; and, if there be truth in the old adage, "Happy the bride whom the sun shines upon," it was specially adapted for a wedding. It was one of those magnificently bright days of early spring when the warmth of the returning sun gives brilliant and genial assurance that summer is on its way; while a lingering breath of wintry frost clarifies and invigorates the pure atmosphere. Not a cloud was to be seen, but here and there a little patch of white vapor, that hurried away before the brisk west wind, as if it felt even its own delicate shadow to be out of place in the transparent sunshine. The snow had vanished from the open places, though remnants of heavy drifts still lay in hollows and shaded spots. Night brought commonly with it frost intense enough to seal up the rivulets that had trickled in every direction during the day, and convert into a dense rime all the vapor that had not been driven seaward by the strong, cool winds that blew from the still ice-bound bosom of the interior. But the days were bright and warm, and night came attended by hosts of stars, twinkling in silvery lustre in the pellucid and deep-blue sky.</p> 
               <p>Towards the close of the afternoon, Captain Dee and William, and Sam Shirk and his wife, who were invited to join the family circle on this occasion, and Mr. Morrison, the clergyman whose quiet but useful labors supervised the spiritual concerns of the little neighborhood, made their appearance by previous appointment. A few brief but solemn words made James and Mary man and wife, in conformity with the unostentatious ritual of Puritan simplicity. The bridal party then sat down, at a profusely laden tea-table, to the last meal in the old house, so intimately connected with the memories of their past lives.</p> 
               <p>A tinge of melancholy generally pervades even what we consider the most joyous events of life. Memories and associations throw their lengthened shadows from the past; and a dim sense of the mutability and chances of human existence checkers the brightest anticipations of present happiness. The far-off cloud interposes between us and the sun. A subdued seriousness took irresistible possession of the family party. The little brothers and sisters of the bride alone exhibited the careless hilarity of a festive occasion, or did justice to the ample supply of good things that graced the board. When even their eager appetites were sated, a moment or two of silence marked the conclusion of the repast. Grave reflections of various character stole quietly over all those hearts, bound to each other by the strongest and closest ties of human love. Mr. and Mrs. Wilmot looked at their daughter, and remembered that the flower so carefully nurtured in their own garden, had been transplanted forever to<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6274-00000189"/> a new home, and intrusted to chances beyond the fond control that had watched over her childhood. Mrs. Butler sat at her end of the table, the post of honor and responsibility so long occupied, and now to be surrendered to her son's wife, absorbed in reflections far deeper than the usual current of her equable temperament. Her fancy, usually so quiescent in the calm routine of every-day life, was startled out of its nest and fluttered vaguely and dreamily over the half-forgotten past; picturing to her her husband, sitting, in the comeliness of youth, where now sat his son and legitimate representative, and herself, a timid girl, happy to nestle confidingly within his manly arms. Briefly she ran over the quiet history of her married life, ending with the sad day when she had last looked upon the face of him who had been to her almost the whole world; and fell back, as she had done on that day of overwhelming grief, upon the only and darling child, that had filled the void in her fond idolatry. As these half-sad, half-happy recollections exhausted themselves, her eyes fixed upon the external surroundings of the life, so uneventful, yet so engrossing to her. She went carefully over the outlines of the familiar room, just as she had once painfully scanned the features of her dead husband, treasuring up in her memory even the scratches and bruises of time, that had so long annoyed her thrifty housewifery.</p> 
               <p>James pushed his chair slightly from the table, a shade of repressed emotion disturbing his features for a moment, and, while his young wife looked up into his steadfast face with ill-concealed anxiety, broke the silence which was becoming painful.</p> 
               <p>"Mother, you are thinking of the old house which has been our home so long; and much reason we all have to recall all we have experienced under its roof. But everything must change and does change in this world; and in place of that which my father built for his day and generation, I have built another more suitable to present circumstances. It will be the dearest wish of Mary and myself, mother, that you shall never regret the change. But there is change in other matters than houses; and you must not think me wanting in respect or affection for you, dear mother, if I feel it right to do some things contrary to the notions you have been accustomed to. If I should, you will never doubt my reverence and love for you, will you?"</p> 
               <p>The widow awoke from her reverie, as James addressed her, but only to stare at him awhile in utter perplexity. After a moment of consternation at so grave a question, she seized upon the last idea of James's long exordium and eagerly replied,-</p> 
               <p>"O! no, my son, I never would believe you did not love me. If I did, I should die."</p> 
               <p>"Well, mother, we are safe, then, on both sides. But I intend to do to-night what some of our good neighbors will think an awful thing, and I am afraid you may be inclined to think so too."</p> 
               <p>"O, dear! my son, what do you mean?"</p> 
               <p>"I mean simply, dear mother, that I have kept up the carpet from the floor of the large parlor, that our young friends may enjoy a good dance to-night."</p> 
               <p>"A dance!" murmured she in renewed dismay. Had her son announced a deliberate design to commit a murder, the bewilderment expressed in his mother's face could not have been greater. Again she faintly ejaculated "a dance!" and, as if the words took away her very breath, sat as if, like Niobe, she was turned<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC6274-00000190"/> to stone. After a vain attempt to arrange the matter in her own mind, she turned imploringly to the clergy man, as having special jurisdiction in such a case. But Mr. Morrison seemed little less disconcerted than herself. He, too, sat with expanded eyes and mouth wide open, as if he had swallowed his knife and fork, and did not know what to do with them. He made no answer to the dame's mute appeal, however; but left her to flounder through the difficulty as she best could. Perhaps he prudently remembered that Butler was the richest and most influential of his parishioners; or perhaps he was in the very common predicament of laboring under an obstinate prejudice, for which he could give no good reason. Whether he did not think it prudent to speak, or had nothing to say, he was mute as a stone. The much exercised old lady, finding the minister himself inadequate to the emergency, fell back in her chair with a despairing commentary of "O my!"</p> 
               <p>A smile flickered over Butler's face, which, however, he repressed and gravely continued:-</p> 
               <p>"I know you have been accustomed, mother, to consider dancing as a folly, if not a sin. But what reason have you for it? It may be abused like everything else, but it is, in itself, a wholesome and graceful exercise. It is one of the most innocent and refined forms of intercourse between young people of the two sexes; and both harmless and agreeable. Moreover, mother, if you want authority higher than mine, you remember that the Bible says that it was even a religious exercise, and used as a manifestation of worship and thanksgiving. David himself danced before the ark. But common sense settles the question sufficiently. I imagine that the puritanic prejudice dice against it arose, partly from its association with dissolute companionship, and partly from the old, sour idea of self-mortification, as if self-denial were of any merit without a sufficient reason and a useful purpose. In any other case, it is not virtue, but mere folly; and leads not to righteousness, but only to self-righteousness,-the most intolerable of faults. It is our duty to be as happy ourselves and make our neighbors as happy as we can, innocently. The boys and girls will dance, mother; and they ought to dance. Let them do it honestly and openly, under the guardianship of social decorum, and not in corners where mischief may creep in, and where the degrading sense of concealment must injure self-respect. So, mother, I mean to give our friends an opportunity to amuse themselves, and myself an opportunity to express my opinion on a somewhat important social question. I hope I have the pleasure of Mr. Morrison's concurrence,"-added Butler, with a sly and half-comic glance at the parson, but going on without waiting for his answer,-"so, Mary, I shall expect to dance the first dance with you, unless mother will honor me with her hand, in which case I must leave you, for that time, to your own merits." Thus, with a smile upon his face that very nearly broadened to a laugh, James concluded his speech; and they all rose from the table.</p> 
               <p>"What will Deacon Hardy say?" remarked Mrs. Butler, as her son hastened to her side.</p> 
               <p>"I hope he won't say anything very hard; if he does, it will not worry me. Mother, I am the representative of a man far wiser and better than ever Deacon Hardy was; and I do not forget it. Neither will I ever forget that I am your son."</p> 
               <p>The widow turned her face upon her child, beaming<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6274-00000191"/> with pride and delight. From that moment, dancing was at least venial with her. Presently James found opportunity to whisper to Mary, "You can't deny that my skirmishing has been successful. Now for the main battle."</p> 
               <p>"O, I do not care for the rest, James, now that your mother is content."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVI.</head> 
               <p>THE bridal party now prepared to leave the plain, small house that had so long been the home of their comforts and pains, their joys and their sorrows, to be ready for the reception of their guests in the statelier and more tasteful mansion which Butler had erected for his own household gods. The warm, golden glow of a clear evening sunset was lingering upon the western sky, and the tops of the distant mountains still shone brightly and sternly beautiful with the last rays of day; while, over the tops of the eastern hills, the full moon renewed the splendor of the vacated sky with a silvery glory, that pervaded every particle of the crisp and pellucid air of the March night, and which, if less powerful, seemed hardly less clear and magnificent than the brilliant day of which it was both the absolute contrast and the worthy peer.</p> 
               <p>In the primitive and inartificial society of pioneer communities, the ultimate classifications of human life are undeveloped. An organized train of servants is an impossibility, and "help," in necessary domestic arrangements, is a precarious and somewhat unreliable element. Therefore Mrs. Wilmot, assisted by the widow's handmaiden, remained behind for a while to expedite certain matters in the commissariat department; while the remainder of the party went over to see how old Jacobs-who had left his out-door duties<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC6274-00000192"/> to a deputy, in order to take charge of the fires and other responsibilities in the new mansion-was performing his part. When they reached the front of the house, the warm, ruddy glow of the bright fires filled the windows; and the parlor was brilliantly lighted up for their reception.</p> 
               <p>"Well, mother," said Butler, "old Jacobs has proved himself an efficient valet." He laid his hand on the lock as he spoke; but immediately the door flew open, and Sam Shirk, with beaming face and a bow that would not have disgraced the best-trained footman, stood before them, to usher them in. A little in the rear was his wife, Jenny, smiling a welcome that evidently came warm from her heart. Both were dressed in their best; but it must be admitted that Sam, in his flurry, forgot to remove his cap; and the courtesy, in which he had carefully drilled his wife, somehow slipped out of the programme. But these slight deficiencies were unfelt and unnoticed.</p> 
               <p>Butler instantly extended his hand to Shirk. "Ah, Sam, you slipped off this afternoon, and I did not know what had become of you. I meant you should have had your tea with us. It was not a month ago, Sam, that you and Mary and I took our supper together under the ice at the brook up yonder. It looks rather more cheerful here, thanks, I presume, at least partly, to yourself and your wife."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, sir," replied the self-appointed porter, "Your mother asked us to stop after the wedding. But Jenny and I thought there was more to look after here than Jacobs could well attend to; so we ran in to help him."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Sam; it was thoughtful and kind."</p> 
               <p>"Kind! O James! Mr. Butler, I mean. Don't I owe my own home, my wife, everything, to you; and what could I think of myself, if I grudged any paints to make your home pleasant to you and Miss Mary?-and to-night too"-</p> 
               <p>What more Sam's feelings might have prompted was lost; for the poor fellow broke down completely. His eyes filled with tears and his voice choked with emotion. Butler shook again the hand of his grateful colloquist, and laughingly rejoined,-</p> 
               <p>"Very good, Sam. But I and Mrs. James Butler-remember, Miss Mary no longer-thank you none the less. You and Jenny will be invaluable to us tonight and save us a world of trouble. If you will undertake to be my major-dome, I shall feel much more at ease, and my wife will be glad to deposit much of her cares with Jenny. Jacobs can see to keeping up the fires; and if you will keep an eye on matters in general, you will greatly oblige me. But our guests will be coming before long, and we must not stand chattering here."</p> 
               <p>The little party now dispersed. Butler, with his new aid-de-camp at his elbow, went through the apartments, and settled all necessary details. The ladies inspected the refreshment tables and other concerns within their province, duties which the skill and diligence of the through housewives who had presided over the preparations, rendered brief and easy.</p> 
               <p>Presently the ringing of the door-bell began to give notice of the arrival of visitors. To many among them, however, such a contrivance was a novelty; for no portal in the village had before been provided with such an appendage. The uninitiated announced themselves by the more primitive institution of their own knuckles; while, others yet, introduced themselves without any announcement at all; considering that a<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC6274-00000193"/> previous invitation and the assurance of a welcome constituted in themselves a very sufficient arrangement, without any further ceremony. The two parlors were soon filled with a numerous company, disposed in all the grim dignity of fidgety restlessness characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon race, in miscellaneous assemblages, especially where habit has not substituted the artificial nothings of society for the more solid requisites too commonly found wanting.</p> 
               <p>A Frenchman is never more at home than in a crowd, and gives himself without difficulty to whatever is going on around him. He is easily satisfied, for the present time, both with himself and his neighbors. But the Englishman or American is discontented and restless where he has nothing special to do; and pleasure without a set purpose is to him an unqualified bore. His personal independence and activity do not readily mingle with an idle concourse. He is too angular to slip easily through the throng, too intense to content himself with a <foreign xml:lang="ITA">dolce far niente.</foreign> That phrase is not translatable into English.</p> 
               <p>In an unsophisticated and quiet little community, like Merrifield, this social embarrassment displays itself in full force. Here were one or two hundred sensible, active, earnest people, taken out of the sphere of their occupations and personal specialities, and dropped down where none of them could tell what they came for, except in a vague sense of friendliness and companionship; or knew what they should do when they got there, but to go home again in due time.</p> 
               <p>Rows of demure old ladies sat strung along upon the sofas, motionless as platoons of soldiers on parade, with hands in their laps, feeling nervously for the knitting-work which was not there, and all looking very much as if they were at a prayer-meeting or a funeral. Now and then, as if in protest against the solemn silence, a remark was made by one to another, embodying something which everybody knew. And replied to by the only answer that human ingenuity could devise to the trite and transparent observation. The outside limits of village experience were soon reached; and the conversation necessarily sunk into the desperate resource of pretty scandal. But what would you have? Those to whom it is not given to be eagles, have no alternative but the microscopic impertinence of the fly.</p> 
               <p>The seniors of the male sex instinctively gathered around the cheerful hearths, and stood about in the genial glow, discussing questions of church, town, and business affairs, mostly already worn threadbare at the stores and street corners, till they would bear handling no longer. Then they amused themselves with a philosophic and taciturn inspection of the new house and its furnishing, with more or less demonstrative calculations of consequences in the way of dollars and cents.</p> 
               <p>The young girls grouped themselves into corners, where they stood, seemingly unconscious, but really wide awake to all around them, giggling and nudging each other, and ready to burst out into innocent riot, but awed into a constrained hypocrisy by the grave glances that were now and then launched forth from the stiff rows of watchful matrons. In spite of the piquet guard of staid mothers, and the vigilant looks, like warning shots, forbidding the crossing of the interdicted lines of prudish restraint, bright eyes brimful of repressed frolic often wandered towards the doors, where the young men loitered, in awkward irresolution, half tempted and half scared. The subdued hum of the current small talk on hand had begun to<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC6274-00000194"/> subside into a dull, monotonous drone, when the opening of the outer door, followed by a stir in the hall, betokened some unusually interesting arrival.</p> 
               <p>The tall, lithe form of the young Sachem of the Passamaquoddies entered into the room with the free, elastic step of the forest. The chief wore a dark blue tunic, girt round the waist with an elaborately embroidered belt of wampum. A silver medal, the governmental indorsement of his hereditary rank, lay on his manly bosom suspended by a scarlet ribbon. Doeskin leggings, fringed along the outer seam, met his richly worked moccasins. A blanket lines with otter-skins hung from his left arm; and he carried in his hand a blue cap, edged with a broad gold lace and circled with the emblematic eagle's feather.</p> 
               <p>Well known as he was to all, every eye was attracted for a moment by his picturesque and dignified appearance, but only to rest, with still deeper interest and admiration, upon a young Indian girl that clung to his side, half bewildered by the novelty of the scene around her. Slender, graceful, and plaint as a reed, the dark, short cloak lined with sable-skins and confined about her waist with a sash, though it covered her figure, could not hide the free grace of her motions, or the sinuous and delicate symmetry of her form. The little moccasin, gayly wrought with porcupine quills, neatly cases a foot and ankle that showed the high-arched and exquisitely moulded contour so often seen in the Indian woman; and her wrists and hands were of corresponding delicacy. Her lovely face recalled the somewhat harsh outline of aboriginal physiognomy only in the severely pure and clean-cut profile of her features. Her dark eyes, of a soft, lustrous brilliancy; long, straight, raven-black hair, and pearly teeth, relieved the tawny skin, so as to make it a beauty, in its own peculiar way, rather than a defect; especially when the bright flush of emotion mantled, distinctly but subduedly visible, through the clear and delicate though dark complexion. This deep-hued flower of the woods was indeed surpassingly beautiful, in the particular type of her race. The whole effect was of a wild loveliness, as of some half-divine nymph of the forest, a hamadryad of Grecian poetry, done in dusky marble.</p> 
               <p>A low murmur of admiration followed the hush of surprise that first greeted the appearance of these two splendid children of Nature,-perfect in the graces of their unconstrained development, yet removed by dignity of station and an appreciation of the general principles of a more refined civilization, from the rudeness and squalor of savage life.</p> 
               <p>The Sachem advanced a few steps into the room, with his timid and beautiful companion nestling close to his side, as a partridge hides under the shelter of a bush. Butler saw and advanced to meet him, with extended hand.</p> 
               <p>"Wishcomet, my friend, you are welcome to my house always, and especially to-night. You got my message, then?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes. Succobash brought faithfully to his chief your errand. And Wishcomet knows," added the young chief proudly, "that his own wigwam is always open to his white friend; and he would have come unbidden, when he heard that your heart was wide open with joy, that he might rejoice with you at your wedding-feast."</p> 
               <p>"Right, Sachem; and this beautiful flower that blooms under my friend's shadow?" said Butler inquiringly<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6274-00000195"/> quiringly, and instinctively adopting the natural metaphor of Indian speech, as he looked courteously towards the Indian damsel.</p> 
               <p>"Yamouna is a daughter of the Penobscot Sachem, and is Wishcomet's wife, according to our customs. But I wished to have been married by the same priest and at the same time with my friend, for you have taught me of the white man's God. He is the same great, good Spirit our fathers worshipped; but you know him better than we, as you do everything else. Yamouna tired on the way, and I am come too late."</p> 
               <p>"Not so, Chief; as well now as an hour or two ago. The clergyman is here, and so are all your white friends. We will hold our wedding-feast together. But first to refresh yourselves.</p> 
               <p>"Mary, take this wild flower to your room with you; and, Wishcomet, come with me. Out friends will excuse us for a few minutes."</p> 
               <p>The new comers retired with their kindly hosts to arrange themselves, leaving the company to discuss the unexpected incident which excited so great and general interest; for, as we know, the young Sachem was both respected and liked. Shirk came near raising a quarrel with a youngster, who, bewitched with the beauty of the Indian girl, expressed his opinion that the native pair fairly rivaled their host and hostess.</p> 
               <p>"Wishcomet's a grand fellow, and his little squaw is handsome as a picture. But nobody shall say, in my hearing, that he's equal to James Butler, or she's as handsome as Mary Wilmot; now, I tell you that, Bill Young."</p> 
               <p>But Bill, thus sharply brought to account, avowed his admiration for the objects of Sam's idolatry in terms so hearty and unequivocal as to appease his hasty indignation; and harmony was restored again.</p> 
               <p>It did not require long to adjust the simple toilet of the children of the woods; and, after a slight refreshment, they returned to the expectant company. Wishcomet led his timid bride by the hand, supported by Mary, while James stood by the Sachem. Perhaps no four beings ever stood side by side, embodying a finer and more instructive pyschologic lesson. Representing in high perfection the distinctive types of their races, four human spirits, in the fresh glow and energy of youth, alike worthy, pure, and true to their capacities and position, alike thorough and high developments of excellence in their appointed sphere; yet how different in fortunes, though so like in moral seeming! The open, manly, and broad intelligence of Butler, buoyant with conscious power and sparkling with the assurance of successful anticipation, contrasted strongly with the melancholy, concentrated, face-compelled intensity of his Indian friend,-adequate to its own proud consciousness, but bowing, in uncomplaining dignity and manly stoicism, to an inexorable destiny. The fair, bright beauty of Mary, confident in her own educated powers, confident in the happy and upward aspects of all her surroundings, contrasted no less strikingly with the dark perfection of her sister grace,-with no hold on earth, no hope, no stay but the deep untutored instincts that twined around a being noble, yet nearly helpless as herself, whom she loved with the untaught love of woman. It was, on one side, like the rosy calm morning, surely brightening to the full noon; on the other, the rich splendor of the evening sky, shadowed and saddened by fast approaching darkness.</p> 
               <p>What human insight can comprehend the vast<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6274-00000196"/> schemes and deep mysteries of Providence! The feeble light of our intelligence often serves but to be wilder and mislead our anxious speculation. So far from holding steadily the balance of right and wrong, our utmost comprehension only suffices to tell us that whatever is, is; our deepest investigation, but blindly to prove that "whatever is, is right."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Morrison arose, as did the whole company, as the bridal party took its station. After a short and touching prayer,-for though somewhat straight-laced, he was a man of kindly feelings and some respectable degree of intellect,-the clergyman pronounced the brief words that tie that sacred bond, upon which the personal sympathies and the duties and interests of two lives are to be woven.</p> 
               <p>At the conclusion of the ceremony, Butler cordially shook hands with the new couple, while Mary kissed the bride affectionately. "Wishcomet," said James, "it is hardly a month since you and I were fighting the Iroquois together; and glad enough was I to have you at my side then. You must stay with us awhile, and help us to enjoy ourselves now, you and Yamouna."</p> 
               <p>The young chief returned his friend's grasp, and replied, "We will stay. The bread of our friends is sweet to us." He then made a signal to Shirk, who thereupon brought him a neatly rolled package. The Sachem, unfolding it, held up a rich robe of soft, glossy sable-skins, which he gently laid with a bow over Mary's shoulders. He also handed at the same time to his wife a pair of moccasins, richly worked with porcupine quills and lined with the same rare fur, from the interior of the parcel, which she presented with a shy smile to Butler. Mary acknowledged the gift of the chief by another kiss to his young wife; while Butler, as he restored the tasteful presents to the care of Sam, expressed his own thanks.</p> 
               <p>"Many thanks, Wishcomet, for your beautiful and friendly gifts. Mary and I have something which we shall by and by ask you and Yamouna to take from us, to keep bright the recollection of our mutual regard. But now, Chief, for the wedding festivities, yours and mine. My people, like yours, dance when their hearts are glad, as indeed do all the peoples of the earth. Will you and Yamouna help us lead the way for our friends? These contra-dances are simple and you will easily follow us, if you will forgive our taking the lead to show you the figure. Then, when our guests have earned their appetites, we will have some supper; and you shall retire to rest or remain, as you may please, with this travel-worn tender one."</p> 
               <p>The chief nodded assent, and Mary and Butler led the way towards the folding-doors that opened into the hitherto closed drawing-room. Sam Shirk slid back the doors at Butler's intimation; and the large, well-proportioned room was disclosed to the admiring gaze of all, flashing with an inspiriting brilliancy, that glowed and sparkled from the crystal pendants of a handsome chandelier which hung from its ceiling. A very tolerable orchestra of two violins and a flute struck up a lively measure; and at the same moment, a youngster, previously, but privately, commissioned for the purpose, proclaimed in a loud voice,-</p> 
               <p>"Young gentlemen, please select your partners for a contra-dance."</p> 
               <p>The scene might then well have, arrested the eye of a Hogarth. The young people seemed inspired, at once, with some irresistible spell of hilarity and activity<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6274-00000197"/> ity. The frost of awkwardness and restraint melted away. The young men that had been hanging about bashfully in by-places, dashed eagerly into the throng, anxious to secure a favorite partner. The damsels ceased their uneasy giggling and fidgetty nestling, and awaited in fluttering expectancy the fulfillment of smothered hopes and fears. But generally, every Jack found his Gill; and a happy crowd, with their hearts full of the strongest and most genial feelings of human nature, followed their leaders to the bright scene of that pleasure, whose outward manifestation was underlaid with the deep and natural tendencies of youth and joy.</p> 
               <p>But this unexpected episode did not affect all the spectators alike. We have already said that the innocent amusement of dancing lay decidedly under the ban of Puritan asceticism. Among the graver portion, even of the last generation, it was accounted, if not one of the chief devices of the devil, at least very far from Scriptural rectitude. A certain portion of the company, therefore, found themselves in a grave dilemma.</p> 
               <p>Deacon Hardy sat grim and defiant in his chair, like a man entrapped but not conquered, a picture of outraged sanctity. The junior deacon looked at his colleague and endeavored to model his countenance after the severe gravity of his senior's face; while the clergyman cast his eyes upon the floor in a desperate non-commitalism, awaiting the issue of events. Old Mrs. Butler anxiously watched all three of the dignitaries of the church, and, seeing, no outward manifestation of opposition, concluded, in her innocent simplicity, that everything was right, after all; and falling happily back upon her confidence in James's judgment, went to look upon the dance, a sight she had hardly ever before seen in her life. The responsible parties to the offense being thus withdrawn and clearly gone over to the enemy of souls, the dissentients were perforce compelled to confine themselves to a helpless interchange of low and muttered condolences and testimonies of horror and dismay, that worried nobody but themselves. Decent courtesy to their entertainers, surprised and a mortifying sense of being outwitted, as well as the important fact that they could devise no tenable ground of condemnation, effectually repressed any open resistance to the bold innovation. They were defeated before they knew the battle was upon them. The enlivening strains of the music and the brilliant show and joyous merriment of the ball-room combined with curiosity to draw almost everybody to the scene of festivity, and committed them to the complicity of passive spectators, if not to the sin of participation in the offense. Once within the range of the fascination, nature and common sense did the rest. The dignity and gentlemanly ease of Butler, the grace of Mary, the free, elastic motion of Wishcomet and his beautiful young bride, the decorous pleasure of all, even the uncouth and immeasurable delight evidenced in the boisterous movements of the less practiced performers, afforded small ground for censure or criticism. Soon mothers began to follow, with interest and pride, the graceful evolutions and youthful buoyancy of blooming daughters, and even to initiate quietly, in their maternal bosoms, private speculations upon life-partnerships. Even hard-faced and practical fathers thought once more, as they watched a manly son, of the soft emotions or ardent and headlong passions, that, in days gone by, had<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6274-00000198"/> thawed through the icy frigidity of New England formalism, and grew younger and happier for the thought. When the music ceased, a low buzz of satisfaction and, as it were, of general congratulation, followed the retiring couples; and when Butler led his wife to her seat, he whispered in her ear,-</p> 
               <p>"What do you think now, Mary? The day is won without even the show of a fight."</p> 
               <p>"O, you, have outdone both Washington and Franklin," was the laughing reply.</p> 
               <p>In truth the victory was complete. When the dancing was resumed, every one that had the smallest skill in the graceful mysteries of Terpsichore,-with some, it must be confessed, who seemed to have been heretofore strangers to her temple,-were speedily on foot and eager for the pleasure.</p> 
               <p>The older guests, whose heads had altogether got the better of their heels, crowded round, amused and delighted spectators,-except a row of sour old crones, chiefly spinsters of indisputable standing, and a few starched and unyielding dogmatists, like Deacon Hardy. But dancing had become an institution in Merrifield, in spite of them.</p> 
               <p>These complacent worthies kept aloof in gloomy and self-denying protest; though it was remarkable that their austerity did not disdain the sofas and most comfortable and luxurious seats. In dignified ease, they solemnly shook their heads, groaned over the degeneracy of the times, and prophesied of the evil yet to come of this unprecedented enormity. But as nothing did come of it, worse than three or four weddings, which were distinctly traceable to this evening as their proximate cause, these dark denunciations fell harmless to the ground.</p> 
                
               <p>After three or four dances had promoted an appetite, a bounteous supper, in which the zesty luxuries of the woods and brooks were combined with every trick of culinary art known in that region, exercised its mollifying influence over the latent irritation of the malcontents. There is as much difference between men and women, before and after a plentiful and genial repast, as between a well-fed and a hungry wolf. The venerable old tabbies were softened down to a mild feeling of devout self-righteousness, by the abundant delicacies and a copious supply of tea, and partially forget the sins of others in the agreeable contemplation of their own virtue. It was even said that, when the dancing recommenced after supper, Deacon Hardy was surprised in the act of peeping over the shoulders of the rearmost of the crowd, to catch a sight of the merry go-round of a Virginia reel. Before midnight the villagers of Merrifield retired to rest, happier and probably wiser than before; and the wedding party became a fixed and imperishable era in their annals.</p> 
               <p>Sam Shirk declared the next day, to an unanimously assentient crowd of youths assembled to discuss the events of the evening, "There an't no such man as James Butler anywhere. It was just the best time that ever was or ever will be; and sooner than not have been there, I'd have given my rifle, through it's a rouser, and all the one I've got."</p>
