I know not if 't was summer then, I know not if 't was spring; But if the birds sang in the trees, I did not hear them sing. If flowers came forth to deck the earth, Their bloom I did not see; I looked upon one withered flower, And none else bloomed for me. JAMES HEDDERWICK. WITHOUT, June sunlight-June's golden sun- light, falling from the blue sky-floating through this sky round, soft, fleecy cloud-masses--heaps of vapory whiteness-so white and dazzling that the eye can scarcely bear to rest upon them despite their beauty, and looking all the whiter and the more daz- zling in contrast with the lovely blue against which they stand in bold yet soft relief- the indescribably perfect blue of a June sky. The sunlight kisses into brighter beauty the gleaming and glancing waves and ripples of the merry little brook which winds, like a 2                  13  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7632-00000005"/> "     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. silver ribbon, among the fields and under the shade of the overhanging trees; its warm, persuasive touches have brought thousands of flowers out of their en- folding buds to greet it. Every now and then a soft breath of air comes, just strong enough to stir the fresh young leaves of the trees and to drive the shad- ows of the floating clouds playfully before it across the cool, rich green of the pastures, or to combine the odors of the many roses, born only this morning, with the fragrant breath of the honeysuckle, whose per- fumed wreaths of pinkish-white flowers climb lavishy over apd garland many a porch. Birds are flitting and fluttering here, there, and everywhere-pretty, familiar brown sparrows; golden-winged orioles; rob- in's scarlet breast gleams here and there in the sun- shine; cat-birds are hopping to and fro among the strawherry-beds, pecking at the ripest and rarest of the fruit-for our sober-coated friend is a true epi- cure, and helps himself--uninvited guest though he be--only to the best; tiny yet pugnacious wrens; swift-winged humming-birds; and every now and then there bursts from some feathered songster's throat a gush of melody. Bees hum  merrily among the flowers; in the cool waters of the little brook the patient cows stand, the tiny ripples of its waters dashing against their knees; others, more sedate, lie in the mingled tracery of sun and shade cast by the breeze-tossed leaves of the trees scattered through their rich pastures; playful white lambs skip and jump beside their staid mothers; for very gladness of heart   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         15 and pleasure in the fair June day there mingles with the gleesome warble of the birds the merry whistle of men and boys. Doors stand widely open to admit the soft, balmy air into the houses; from these houses there come at intervals a few notes of a song in some sweet female voice; over the flower-beds, crowned and covered lavishy with their June beauty and glory of bloom, float butterflies of every hue, rival- ling in color and brilliancy their earth-born sisters. In a word, the earth has donned her fairest, brightest raiment to welcome this, the holiday season and gala- time of the whole year; every moment calls forth some new life into being, some new beauty into bloom to greet it. Without, all seems, as it were, in tune-- uniting, I might say, in one grand anthem of praise and thanksgiving for this perfect day; the rising incense of the flowers' breath is only a higher note in that anthem, too faint, delicate, and sweet for our flesh-dulled senses to perceive. It is such a day, one might think, as was known in Eden - a day which makes us wonder how and why, in this strange wourld of ours, where there is so much of life and 'love and beauty to be found, there can be such sad things as sin and suffering and death. Looking upon the fair face of Nature on this day, - which, as I well know, I have but faintly, feebly, imperfectly portrayed, -you can scarcely believe in the existence of these trials of our frail humanity; you put the mere thought of them away from you. What have such things as they in common with this day, when all is so fair without? How is it within? I   &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7632-00000006"/> 16     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. One might think that all within the cosy little houses which stand, each in its own garden, on either side of the one long street forming the little village in which the scene of this, my opening chapter, is laid, might be as bright and as joyous as all is without. There are stories attached to some of these home-like, unpretending dwellings and their inmates - romances which never have and never will be written, a truism which has been repeated over and over again until it is hackneyed, worn, and commonplace; yet, forsooth, we who live in these later, older, and so-called wiser years of the world, can only follow in the beaten track made and trodden by the many who have gone before us in the "good old times,"-only "good" in this, I think, because then one had some chance of being original, and of saying something never heard before. All we can do is to try and tell the often-told story better than it has yet been told. With the wise man we must say, There is nothing new under the sun. Those who came before us had all that was new; what has come to us is all old. But only in one of these houses, on which the sun- light falls so cheerily this morning, is there anything on which I may choose to linger. Over this house the ivy grows in clinging greenness; the white June rose climbing over and garlanding the porch has opened a countless wealth and profusion of buds and blossoms to meet the sun. His rays may fall as brightly as they will, on ivy-grown wall, rose-Wreathed porch, and gay parterre; but they are shut out carefully from the   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         17 rooms into which they were once gladly welcomed. Had Clyde Wardleigh her own will to-day, she would blot out this fair June day from the record of days; over its blue sky, its white cloud-islands, she would cast the dark gloom and pall of night; she would silence the merry song of the birds, grating and jarring as it does upon her ear; she cannot under- stand why it is that everything should be so bright and joyous, in bitter mockery, as it were, of her own feelings. Clyde does not think of this - she only feels it; she could not, if she would, put it into words; there is but one thought, one idea, in her mind to-day, and she is only dimly, vaguely conscious that the brightness without seems to deepen, by very contrast, the darkness within. For it is very dark and dreary in the quiet cottage to-day-more quiet than ever, with a solemn stillness brooding over the house. The blinds are drawn down at the windows, the shutters bowed; in the cool matted parlor the pictures on the walls are veiled and hidden with white draperies; but the coldest, whitest, stillest thing in all that still house is the pale form, which, arrayed in the last habilimnents this poor mortality of ours can need and can wear-the spotless white - sa- cred alike to our baptismal robes, the bridal dress, and the shroud, has this morning been laid in the narrow shell in which it is to rest through- who shall say nay - its long, dreamless sleep of perchance countless ages. A faint, sickly smell of rose-geranium lingers in the air: because she, whose spirit once animated&amp; M2 *        B Sti  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7632-00000007"/> 18     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. this pale clay, loved its fragrant leaves, Clyde's own hands have gathered and placed them between the cold fingers clasped upon that pulseless breast. Through a tiny space at one window, where the wandering June breeze has blown the blind aside, one ray of the sunshine which everywhere seeks admission has crept in; and, unawed by the stern majesty and presence of the mighty King to whom we are all subject -whose chill hand, sooner or later, will be laid upon each one of us, in turn; it, even as like seeks like, has sought out and has found the one only bright thing in the room, to fall and to rest in its glory upon the golden head of the girl who kneels, in all the abandonment of grief, by her mother's coffin. Her face is pale-pale, I might say, as death, were it not that warm living flesh cannot wear that cold pallor only given by the Destroyer's fingers. There are dark circles around her eyes; eyes that are heavy with watching and weeping; eyes which now shed no tears. Clyde thinks she has wept their sources dry, and longs for a few. drops to come, if only to cool the burning dryness they feel. Her dress is white - black garments lie, all ready for her, in her chamber- -but so long as that dear form is left to her, she will not put them on. In a few hours that precious clay will be hidden away for ever from her sight-time enough then for the sombre dress of orphanhood; an orphanhood doubly painful, because it is to be spent among strangers - her own blood, her own kin, to be sure, yet all the stranger for that very kindred. Clyde   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         19 will not think of it: she knows that when the funeral rites are over, her aunt will take her to her own home; she knows the promise has been given that she shall be as a daughter there; but what, to-day, does she care for the future? It is as nothing to her- she does not care what happens to her - her only wish would be to lie down with her dead mother in the same grave; but at fifteen life is strong within us, and the wish to cast it away is no sincere one! The long, bright hours of the summer day passed slowly, and still Clyde knelt by her dead mother's side. Mingled with her grief comes the thought that she still has it in her power to fulfil a duty to her lost parent;- the promise those now silent lips asked of her, the girl thinks will be easy to keep. She cannot understand how she ever will have the slightest wish to break it or to speak of it; -to Clyde it is a solemn vow, the full meaning of which she does not, and for years will not, understand. Yet, as she bends to press her last kiss, sadly, painfully conscious that it is the last, upon those cold, unanswering lips, she murmurs once more--"Mother, I promise!" There are many promises made to the dying which are but empty words, never heeded, and forgotten almost as soon as spoken; but this promise will be kept. It is Clyde's legacy from her mother; it will influence, little as she thinks it now, her future life. And in a 'few hours more this first scene of my story closes, and all that can be done for the dead mother has been done-the last duties paid-and Clyde Wardleigh's new life has begun.  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7632-00000008"/> 20     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. It could, I know, have been told more briefly; a few bold strokes might have sketched the picture - a girl, scarce more than a child, weeping, on a clear June day, over her dead mother. That is all - no- thing more. Will you read her story? You will find nothing new, nothing strange in it- no grand deeds, no start- ling events-no great crimes, no wondrous virtues. therein depicted.

I have given you but a glimpse of her.

The curtain falls only to rise again; the prologue to Clyde Wardleigh's story is over. CHAPTER II. LOOKING BACK. I summon up remembrance of things past. - SHAKSPEARE. SIX months passed slowly before Clyde Ward- leigh even began to reconcile herself to the change which had come into her young life. Some natures, like certain plants and flowers, cling so fondly to their native soil and early associations, that they illy bear transplantation, and hers was one of these. Only with time could she learn to form new ties, new affec- tions, and to think calmly of the sudden rupture, the sudden loss of the old ones; and the change from the quiet, peaceful home of which she and her mother had been the only inmates, to the handsome residence of the wealthy John Bertrand, with its constant bustle and excitement, was something to which Clyde could  ^  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7632-00000009"/> 22     CLYDE WARDLEIGH not 'easily become accustomed -so different was it from her hitherto tranquil; uneventful life. She could iot understand why it was that till now she had been wholly ignorant of the existence of these relatives, with whom her present lot was cast. She wondered if they had been equally ignorant of her existence. Their past and her own were totally dis- connected from, and independent of, each other. She had never even heard her mother speak of this sister of hers -this "Aunt Margaret," to whom, just one week before her death, Mrs. Wardleigh's trembling, feeble hand had traced a few scarcely legible lines; yet these lines had brought Mrs. Bertrand at once to the village to .her sister's side, had made her clasp Clyde's slight form in her arms, and in tones faltering with grief, yet which almost startled the girl, -so like were they to those she had so often heard from those dear lips, now silent forever, -assure Clyde that so long as she lived her dead sister's child should never need a home, lack a mother's care, nor know the want of a mother's love. Clyde had heard, as in a dream; promises for the future were as nothing to her -only " empty sounds and meaningless words in comparison with the bitter agony of the present. 'Yet she bore it  all tearlessly, even as she had stood by the open grave and heard the solemn "dust to dust, ashes to ashes," with the dull 'responsive echo from the coffin of the falling earth-the dreariest, mournfullest of all mourn- ful, dreary sounds, so hopelessly do we listen to it - in a sort of dull apathy. She had silently returned   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         23 to the cottage and prepared for her journey, moving as though she were scarcely conscious of what she was doing, until, at last, Mrs. Bertrand grew frightened at this unnatural calmness; and it was with a feeling of inexpressible relief that, late on the evening of the second day of their journey, she led Clyde and wel- comed her to her own home. Here another surprise awaited Clyde. Mrs. Ber- trand's only daughter, a girl just one year Clyde's se- nior, bore her dead mother's name- Ellen -and hanging in Mrs. Bertrand's own' room there was a portrait of the features so dear to the orphan's heart. Yet Clyde could scarcely believe that the bright girlish face there pictured was the same as the pale wasted one so dear to her, so lately hidden away from her sight. She wondered if her calm, sad mother ever could have worn so clear and unclouded a brow; if the lips she remembered as being so seldom parted in a smile could ever have curved in that arch, mirthful way; if the sad eyes which had lingered so fondly upon her, ever could have been as bright and sparkling as those pictured orbs; if the frail, feeble, attenuated form she remembered had ever been rounded out into those graceful, youthful outlines. Yet "Ellen Clyde" was written in one corner of the canvas; Mrs. Bertrand's voice had trembled as she said to Clyde, "Your mother's picture," and the girl could only look ear- nestly, striving to find some faint resemblance, and then wonder at what she saw. She asked no questions. Perhaps it was as well  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7632-00000010"/> 24     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. that Clyde's pride kept her from showing her igno- rance of her mother's past. The story of Ellen Clyde's youth was scarcely one that a woman would care to tell her daughter. The petted, idolized, younger child of a rich man, she had loved, and loved imprudently; and, unaccustomed to opposition, indulged in every- thing, only consulting her own wishes -her father's refusal of her to her lover was followed by an elope- ment. There were good reasons for Mr. Clyde's dis- approval of the marriage; and the daughter's conduct so wounded and grieved the father, that from this day forward her name was never mentioned before him; it was a forgotten sound in her former home. Ellen Wardleigh was more lost to her family than she would have been had the graVe closed upon her. They lost sight of her for years; yet Margaret Clyde never forgot her sister. With the passing years changes came-into her own life;, she married, and her marriage was speedily followed by her father's death. During his lifetime, and in obedience to his wishes, she had refrained from seeking her sister; but, after his death, Mrs. Bertrand spared no trouble in endeavoring to find Ellen. There were five thousand dollars left her in her father's will - a mere trifle in comparison with his wealth; the rest was left to Mrs. Bertrand for her life, to be-divided afterwards among her children. Had it been left otherwise, Margaret Bertrand's sense of justice would have made her share it equally with her sister; but her father's will had put this out of her power. Yet even the paltry legacy   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         25 left Ellen Wardleigh was a partial forgiveness; and Margaret Bertrand sought her, but all in vain. She had so carefully secluded herself that not the faintest trace of her could be found; until, after the lapse of many years, the long silence was at last broken, and the receipt of a few scarcely legible lines from the wanderer told Mrs. Bertrand much that she had long and vainly desired to know; took her to her sister's dying-bed just in time for one long interview; and finally added a new inmate to her household. it was with a little very natural hesitation, dearly though Margaret Bertrand had loved her sister, that she received that sister's orphan daughter into her home. What Ellen Clyde had been in childhood and in girlhood, she well remembered -charming, way- ward, and affectionate; - as woman, wife, and mother, she knew nothing of her. Ellen had told her enough, in their one interview, to prove to her that her life had been one full of' cares and unhappiness; but she knew nothing of how the influence of these trials - the mere thought of which made Mis. Bertrand shudder -had affected Ellen; or how she had formed and moulded the young life entrusted to her care. But Margaret Bertrand was not the woman to shrink from the per- formance of any duty, much less one which lay as plainly as did this before her; and its fulfilment was rewarded at last. Alice Clyde--such was the girl's full name- Mrs. Bertrand could understand the feel- ing which had prompted Mrs. Wardleigh in naming her child after her mother - presently won to herself 3  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7632-00000011"/> 26     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. all the love Mrs. Bertrand had once lavished upon her sister. Not at once, however; it took time. But as this hesitationI disappeared, and this love grew and strengthened, there rose with it a new feeling of anx- iety for Mrs. Bertrand. It was the feqr lest some day, led by a natural curiosity, Clyde might question her concerning her mother's early years, her childhood, her maiden life --questions which would have been easy enough to answer, had it not been that they might have been followed by others touching upon more painful subjects. Mrs. Wardleigh, while acknowledg- ing, in that one interview with her sister, that her early error had brought with it its own punishment, and that her married life had been full of almost unendur- able misery, had expressed a wish that Clyde - so called, instead of Alice, in memory of the happy days of her girlhood - should be kept, if possible, in igno- rance of the circumstances attending her marriage, and the wretchedness that had grown out of it. Mrs. Ber- trand might have spared herself all this uneasiness - no question on the subject ever passed Clyde's lips- she never even alluded to the past. Such questions as her aunt chose to ask her, concerning her mother, were quietly and concisely answered; but it was a subject she herself never voluntarily introduced. Almost too calm, too self-contained for her years, she seemed de- sirous, so Mrs. Bertrand thought, of burying the past in oblivion, and never, in the slightest manner, allud- ing to what once had been. It was, in truth, a degree of reticence almost unnat- 9   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         27 ural in so young a girl. Perhaps it was due, in part, to the life Clyde had led, with no companion save her mother, who had quietly endeavored to keep her daughter to herself, avoiding those among whom she lived, and preventing her forming any of the intima- cies and friendships which young girls form so easily, and trying to make Clyde cling only to herself. It may have been that she had inherited her mother's disposition, which since her marriage had led her to live within herself. Mrs. Bertrand thought it over, but uselessly: could this calm, impassive girl be the daughter of the gay, impetuous Ellen who had once been the light of the home?  Like produces like; yet here the axiom seemed to lose its truth. Yet, all unconsciously to herself, the course Mrs. Bertrand adopted was the wisest that, under the cir- cumstances, she could possibly lhave followed. She took no notice of Clyde's quiet ways, letting them pass as a mere matter of course, and treating her as' though she had been accustomed to them for her whole life; she let the girl fall naturally into her own place and find her own level in their midst. In a word, she let Time do his usual work. It would not, however, have answered in all cases. But Clyde Wardleigh was older than her years; her character at fifteen was as much formed as is that of most girls at eighteen, and Mrs. Bertrand's thorough knowledge of, and in- sight into human nature had guided her aright. ' I cannot understand her!" the impulsive Ellen exclaimed, one day, when talking oClyde to her  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7632-00000012"/> -28    . -CLYDE WARDLEIG-H. mother. "She takes no interest in anything, and although she has been with us now three months, I know her no better to-day than I did the day she came." "We must make many allowances for her, Ellen." "I am ready and willing to make every possible allowance for her, mother dear," Ellen said. I want - to love Clyde- I do love her; but I don't believe that I shall ever really know her--shall ever feel that, she is--as you promised me, as I hoped-like a sister to me."  "My impatient girl, Rome was not built in a day; nor can you expect those who were perfeet-trangers only a few weeks past to feel at ease with each other at once. Clyde has not yet recovered from the shock her mother's death was to her; it will take time for her to adapt herself to her present circumstances. Be patient, Nell; your cousin needs your utmost con- sideration--your affectionate but unobtrusive sym- pathy." "And I am neither patient, unobtrusive, nor sym- pathetic," Ellen began, laughing. Then, suddenly changing her tone, she continued, "But for all that, I feel sincerely sorry for my cousin, and if she only would let me, I would love her dearly-poor Clyde!"  "Put yourself in her place, Ellen, and try to imag- ine what your own feelings would be under similar circumstances. That will teach you sympathy, which, after all, is nqoing but the power of fully understand- ing and entering into the feelings of others."   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         29 "I cannot imagine myself in Clyde's position," Ellen said, thoughtfully, --an orphan, not only mo- therless, but fatherless, we, her nearest relatives, almost perfect strangers to her. I fear, were- I in the same situation, that I should be repining and rebellious instead of being the calm, impassive creature Clyde is." "The calm is only on the surface," Mrs. Bertrand said. "It requires an effort, and a very constant effort, to preserve it. Your cousin has wonderful powers of self-control." "Is that meant for a quiet rebuke to me?"Ellen asked, with a smile. "I know I am sadly deficient in that quality; if I only could give Clyde a little of my flow of high spirits in exchange for part of her self-control! By the way, I wonder why Aunt Ellen happened to call her 'Clylde instead of using her pretty first name, 'Alice.' It is such a strange name for a girl, but yet I like it." A slight shade came over Mrs. Bertrand's face; it always camne whenever hler sister was mentioned. "I suppose that your aunt wished to show her affectionate remembrance of her maiden name." "And I believe, after all, that it suits her as, per- haps, no other name would,--Clyde. Alice would scarcely seem natural now. Only I do wish she would be a little more like other people -more cheerful- and not so exceedingly quiet." "Impatient again, Ellen. Clyde is scarcely her own true self yet; cheerfulness and knowledge of one another will come in time." 3*  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7632-00000013"/> 30     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. "And I should think you a false prophet, mother dear, were it not for one thing." "And that?" "Is simply this-that she has completely won little Georgie's heart. He thinks no one quite equal to Clyde, and is never as good with any one else as he is with her. That is my encouragement for the future; Clyde has a heart. I shall try to win a place in it for myself." Ellen Bertrand was right. Clyde Wardleigh had a heart-a warm, loving, affectionate heart-in which her aunt and cousins were already firmly established. But Clyde was not demonstrative; she never expressed in words what she really felt. She was deeply grate- ful to her aunt for letting her remain unnoticed -for so seldom making any reference to the past. And yet Clyde was very far from desiring to forget it; it was not that. She regarded it as something too precious, too tender to be spoken of-something she would keep for herself, her very own, in which no one beside should have share or part. Most persons like to speak of those whom they have loved, who are taken away and separated from them by death; they like to recall and to live over the events connected with them, to make them an ever-present reality. Not so was it with Clyde. Calm though she apparently was, the merest allusion to her lost mother brought back some of the same tearless agony she had felt in those three long, lonely days, her first days of orplanhood. Al- though the past was scarcely ever absent from her   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         31 thoughts, she could not bear to share those tender yet painful memories with another; they were hers, and hers only. Mrs. Bertrand partly saw and understood this, and Clyde's feelings to her--which had first par- taken of gratitude for 'her consideration --presently ripened into love. Yet, to all appearance, her growing attachment to her aunt wrought no change; for Clyde wished to set her past apart from her present - as a thing in which they with whom she now lived had nothing in com- mon with her. But it was never absent from her thoughts; she brooded over her sorrow until it influ- enced her every action, till its indulgence made her morbid and listless, -interested in nothing and no- ticing no one save little Georgie, the youngest member of the household. Very reluctantly, Mrs. Bertrand at last resolved to speak to Clyde, to endeavor to rouse her, to warn her of the danger of indulging and becoming a slave to her feelings, to set ler duty, not only to herself but to others, before her, - when events happened which opened Clyde's eyes to the selfishness of the life she was leading, and taught her that in exerting herself for others she could best find consolation for and forgetfulness of her own sorrow.  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7632-00000014"/> 32     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. CHAPTER III. A CHANGE. Tender for another's pain.- GRAY. THEN    there is a considerable difference in the , ages of children who belong to the same home- circle, it generally is a token that some of the fair flowers which have come to adorn and make up the full completeness of the family garland have been taken away by the hand of the Great Reaper. But the interval between Ellen and her little brother George-the pet and plaything of the family--had never been filled, and so the circle had never been broken. For thirteen years, to the great regret of the parents, Ellen had been their only child. This posi- tion -which those who are members of large families sometimes look upon so enviously - is yet not one to be coveted; and it was with feelings of deep thank- fulness as much for Ellen's sake as for their own - that Mr. and Mrs. Bertrand welcomed the giving of little George to their arms. He was a beautiful child- bright, affectionate, and interesting-just three years old; petted, yet, strange to say, not spoiled, at the time that Clyde Wardleigh - became a member of the Bertrand household. Shy though the child generally was with strangers, he never had shown the slightest timidity with his cousin,   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         33 but on the very day of her arrival had gone up to her, and, laying his little -hand on hers, had said to her, "Take Georgie up; he loves you." Clyde had complied with the request, and from that time, no mat- ter how preoccupied she might be, no matter how desolate or lonely she might feel, at Georgie's approach she would force her lips to wear a smile, would lay aside her book to amuse him, would drive away her own thoughts so as to join in his play to amuse him, or else to comply with the request so often heard from childish lips, uttered in Georgie's pleaiding, winning tones, "Please tell Georgie a 'toly." The child had found his way into Clyde's heart, and there was no sound sweeter to her than the tones of the baby voice, when they formed themselves into the name he had given her, (' Kydie." Had Clyde been less morbid, less absorbed in her own feelings and in herself: she would, soon have seen that her aunt and cousin would have been only too glad to show her --the one, a mother's, the other, a sister's love. But the total want of all intercourse be- tween her own mother and her aunt; her knowledge that but for them she would have been alone in the world, as they were, so far as she knew, her only rela- tives; her feeling that they were as well aware of this fact as she herself, had made our proud Clyde imagine that their conduct towards her had been prompted chiefly by a sense of duty, by pity for her, and even after this feeling wore off, as it did before long, and she saw that, like little Georgie, they loved her for herself, C  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7632-00000015"/> 34     CLYDE WAPDLEIGH. she could not exert herself; so much had her morbid indulgence of her feelings blinded her to what was in truth best for her, that she would not, because she really could not, see that " prime wisdom " of duty which, step by step, would lead her in what lay before her in daily life. In later years Clyde saw, and fully understood all this, and learned that what she had at the time considered only a fitting reverence for the memory of a departed and beloved parent was in truth selfishness, yet wear- ing such a mask that she had not thought it selfishness. In hopes that Clyde might be roused and led to exert herself, Mr. and Mrs. Bertrand determined that she should accompany Ellen to the school the latter at- tended-one of the best in the city. They thought, the being thrown into contact with others, and com- pelled to study - as every girl who has a spark of am- bition or any self-respect must do at school-- would act as a sort of mental tonic, and make her more cheer- ful and contented. Clyde obeyed her aunt, as she al- ways did, unquestioningly; but the desired change was not effected, and once more Ellen complained to her mother that school had done Clyde no good. Her les- sons were perfectly learned and recited; and she stood well in her. classes; but she could fiot yet feel that she knew her cousin, and she told her mother that none of their schoolmates had made the slightest progress to- wards acquaintance, much less intimacy, with the quiet - orphan. But Ellen was mistaken. Two of the girls had no- ticed Clyde, and were trying to overcome the timid   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         35 reserve in which she lived.  Lille Lewis was the daughter of theeBertrand's family physician and friend, and she truly pitied the sad-looking girl who seemed so ill at ease in their little world of school. She tried to win her friendship, content if at times Clyde's soft eyes gave her a thankful look, hoping that after awhile she might win more. It was true pity in Lille- an orphan herself, her mother being dead-Clyde's black dress had inspired her with the truest sympathy, and, by slow degrees, her efforts were succeeding. Nora Reynolds, the very day of Clyde's appearance at the school, had asked who she was, and on being told that she was Mrs. Bertrand's niece, had immediately de- cided that she was worth cultivating, and Nora Rey- nolds' decisions were generally carried out. At last 'Mrs. Bertrand herself resolved to speak to Clyde. She did not wish to do it pointedly, or even to give her words the least appearance of a rebuke, which might pain the girl's sensitive nature; she would wait for a fitting opportunity to present itself, and then, as gently as might be, urge the girl to live less within herself and more with others. Mrs. Bertrand did not consider the walk to and from school, comprising only a few squares, sufficient exercise. The very, quiet life that Ellen and Clyde led, regular and retired,- for Mrs. Bertrand did not believe that school-girls should be allowed to join in the whirl of fashionable gayety-going to parties, re- ceiving company, and so growing old before their \ time--destroying, by too carly contact with the world,  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7632-00000016"/> 36     EOLYDE WARDLEIGITo the retiring modesty and sweet freshness which form the chief charm of girlhood, and replacing them with i the self-possession and independence - to use the very \ gentlest words-for which American girls of the pres- \ent day arenoted; and Mrs. Bertrand was determined that, so far as it lay in her power to secure it, her daughter and niece should grow up to be pure, gentle women, free from all stain of " fastness " or of " dash," content with home duties and pleasures, -and so their quiet life rendered exercise necessary; and each of the girls was provided with a pony, and certain hours each day, when the weather permitted, were spent in riding, which soon came to be one of their chief pleasures. This particular day, however, Clyde had pleaded a severe headache as an excuse for remaining at home, and Ellen had gone, only attended by the groom, their usual escort, on her accustomed ride. Mrs. Bertrand had made no objection. This, she thought, would be a favorable opportunity for her long-desired conversa- tion with Clyde, and it was very evident, even to un- observant eyes, that the girl was really suffering. She' had. thrown herself upon the lounge in the library, and even little Georgie's endeavors to find a companion in her proved useless. Clyde begged him, gently, to let her alone; and when at last Mrs. Bertrand sought her niece, she found that, worn out by the pain, she had fallen asleep, and she would not disturb her, much as she regretted losing the opportunity for her long, confidential conversation with Clyde. She slept until   \ CLYDE WARDLEIGI.        37 the long, slanting rays of the setting sun, shining through the bay-window at the western end of the room, and falling upon her face, awakened her from her slumbers. She lay still, enjoying the freedom from pain, which, after any intense suffering, is such perfect enjoyment in itself, and that delicious restful- ness, half slumber, half consciousness, which accom- panies our first waking nioments, - when she noticed that there seemed to be an unusual stir and bustle in the house of people passing to and fro, low, hurried exclamations, and once or twice Clyde thought she heard her own name mentioned. But it was all so indistinct, mingling as it did with the faint, dream- like sounds and shadows which were still vaguely present with her; arid she was so unaccustomed to :taking any part in the daily occurrences of the house- hold, that she lay still, scarcely even wondering whart could have disturbed the usual quiet routine of the establishment, and feeling satisfied to let things go on as they 'would, provided she were only passed over and left in peace. Presently the library-door was pushed open and a head looked in at the aperture, and a voice called, "Miss Clyde! Miss Clyde!" "What do you want, Mina?"Clyde asked,'raising herself on her elbow and looking at the person, who, as she spoke, entered the room, and, walking up to the foot of the lounge on which Clyde lay, stood there, rolling the corner of her apron between her fingers and thumb, and evidently not only frightened but 4  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7632-00000017"/> 38     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. embarrassed. ." Why don't you speak?"Clyde went on; "what is the matter with you?" The girl she addressed was a short, stumpy personage of about seventeen, with black hair, so very curly that it resisted all efforts to reduce it to smoothness; sharp, piercing, deeply-set black eyes, and a large but good- natured mouth. No one could ever have taken Mina Krepp for anything but what she really was, or, look- ing into her face, full of a certain something which was not smartness, but shrewdness, have doubted her abil- ity to make her own way in the world. In Mrs. Bertrand's house she filled a sort of nondescript posi- tion - something between a nurse and a lady's maid, and while she was continually getting herself into hot water, as she expressed it, with the other servants in the house, yet she was so devoted to little Georgie, so willing, and so obliging to her superiors, that Mrs. Bertrand, knowing from what a home she had come to them, was willing to overlook many faults and defi- ciencies. She had applied, nearly two years before, for the position of nurse. It was a pitiful story she told, -how they lived on the very outskirts of the city in a low, filthy hovel, where she was by turns beaten and starved, and which she had at last deter- mined to leave, in hopes of bettering her condition. Mrs. Bertrand went to the place, and found that Mina had not exaggerated the truth. On inquiry, she found that the girl bore a good reputation for honesty and industry; and upon the father- a drunken, worthless scamp- promising never to interfere with her, Mrs.   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        39 Bertrand engaged her. Ignorant and superstitious though she might be, she was yet quick and observ- ing, and, in spite of her many shortcomings, was a very useful personage. Such was the individual who had come to rouse Clyde from her long inaction: a strange means, one might think, of producing such a result, if we did not remember that very often the touch of uninterested and unconcerned hanids sets the wheel of circumstance in motion! "What is the matter, Mina?"Clyde repeated. "Stop rolling your apron, and tell me what you want." "I just knowed that somethin' was agoin' to hap- pen when I got up this mornin'," Mina began. "You see, Miss Clyde, I did n't do nothin'." Mina had a great aversion to the letter "g" at the end of her words, and slighted it as persistently'as our cockney cousins slight the consonant which follows it in the alphabet. "I didn't do nothin' but dream about eggs all last night, and then when I seen that there spook in the cellar this mornin', why, I just knowed that somethin' was goin' to happen." A 'spook in the cellar,' Clyde repeated, throw- ing herself carelessly back upon the lounge; "there are no such things." "But indeed there are, Miss Clyde," Mina went on, eagerly; "for I seen this one my own self, like a great white thing with wings; and when I went to where it was, it had just gone away into nothin', and then  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7632-00000018"/> 40     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. I knowed somethin' must surely be a-goin' for to happen." Clyde laughed. "Well, nothing seems to have hap- pened as yet." ' But indeed and there has, Miss Clyde." Well, have you lost your money, or what have you broken?"Clyde asked, these being Mina's chief trou- bles,.and of almost daily recurrence. "Oh, Miss Clyde! I dase nt tell you!" "iNonsense, Mina," Clyde began; "I cannot see what there is to make such a fuss about." Mina dropped her apron and came closer to where Clyde lay. "' Oh, Miss Clyde, do please come right away down stairs -they sent me to call you. Miss Ellen she's been thrown from her horse, and they think she's dead already; and Mrs. Bertrand she's fainted away; and - But Clyde waited to hear no more; she sprang from the lounge, and rushed out of the room. Mina fol- lowed her in a more leisurely manner, repeating to herself, as she came down stairs: "I just knowed that somethin' was a-goin' to happen! I never dreamt of them eggs, and seen that spook for nothin'! I guess it's all over with poor Miss Nelly this time! I just knowed that somethin' was a-goin' to happen!" And Mina sat down on the step, and, putting her apron over her head, began to cry. Clyde found, on reaching the dining-room, that Mina's story was only too true. Her cousin lay on   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        41 the sofa, so pale, so white, and so motionless, that at the first hurried glance she was, sure that Ellen was dead. The frightened domestics gathered around her, not one of them seeming to know what ought to be done. Clyde sent one of them   hastily for Dr. Lewis; a second for Mr. Bertrand, and then, while using every restorative she could think of to bring back her aunt, who had fainted, to consciousness, and having her removed gently to her own room, she found time to inquire how the accident, the result of which she saw, had happened. From the disconnected story of the groom, Clyde learned that her cousin had ridden out in a direction totally different from their usual route. Their rides had generally been through the quieter and less fre- quented streets of the city, and thence to the roads near by, where they might, without attracting too much at- tention, enjoy the delightful sensation of a brisk gal- lop. This afternoon, however, Ellen told the groom that as her cousin was not with her, she would take a shorter ride. The road she selected ran, for a short distance, parallel with a railroad; and while returning home, her horse took fright at the rapid and noisy passage of a train of cars, and ran away with her, fortu- nately in the direction of home. Ellen had kept her seat, and the groom had followed her closely, without being able to overtake her, yet every moment thinking she would be able to regain control of her horse. But as the animal abruptly turned the corner of the street leading into that in which the Bertrands lived, he had 4*  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7632-00000019"/> 432     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. started, at what, Roberts could not say; and when he came up, almost at the same moment, he had found Ellen lying on a pile of stones, cold, white, and insen- sibe.' They were fortunately so near home, that, with the assistance of some of the people in the neighbor- hood, Roberts had brought his young lady to the house, had called Mrs. Bertrand, who, totally unpre- pared for the shock of what she thought was her daughter's death,Ihad fainted away, thereby adding to and increasing the general confusion and alarm, and Clyde found that her presence was a real relief to the terrified household. It was as though she had suddenly assumed a new character. The servants crowded around her for di- rections, glad, as is usual with that helpless class, to have some one on whom  to lay all responsibility. 'Clyde wondered, when she had time to think, at her- self; and yet, after all, it was only resuming the duties that had devolved upon her during her own mother's lifetime; only carrying out one of the duties which fall naturally upon womanhood. It was her voice which, on Mr. Bertrand's arrival, carefully broke the news of Ellen's accident to him; her care which finally restored her aunt to consciousness; her hand which aided the doctor, so far as it could, she being the only one who retained composure. Clyde's self-control stood her in good stead here, in his examination of Ellen; and at last she had the pleasure of telling the parents - too agitated to remain in the room- that their child was not dead, that she had opened her eyes and spoken,   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         43 and the physician gave them hopes of her eventual recovery. And Mrs. Bertrand, clasping the girl's slight form in her arms, could only give her kiss after kiss- such kisses as Clyde had often longed for, yet which she had never felt since her mother's lips had grown chill in death - and say to her: "Clyde! Clyde! what should we have done to-day without you? What can I do for you in return?" And for the first time in her life Clyde voluntarily threw her arms affectionately around her aunt's neck, and, returnin g Mrs. Bertrand's kisses, whispered, in the winning tones which she so well remembered, the soft tones of Ellen Clyde's voice, renewed in that of her t' daughter:. "Only love me, Aunt Margaret; only love me!" Later, when the confision in the house had in some degree subsided, when Ellen had been carefully con- veyed to her own room, and lay there, so quietly asleep that Mr. and Mrs. Bertrand, most thankful that their daughter's life had been spared, returned to the library, the usual resort for the family in the evening, they heard little Georgie, who, as usual, had nestled into his cousin's lap, say suddenly: "Why for you cry, Kydie? Tell Georgie why for? Your cheek all wet!" "Because I am so happy, Georgie," was the soft reply. "So funny!  When I happy, I laugh; it make Kydie cry. Why for, Kydie?   &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7632-00000020"/> "     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. Clyde's low, rare, rippling laugh answered the boy. C Dear Georgie, I cannot make you understand." But I glad 'cause you is happy," he said, content- edly. And Clyde kissed the child; and felt thankful that, in spite of Ellen's accident, and the strain the whole thing had been upon her nerves, she had yet spoken the truth when she told little Georgie she was happy. And why?   Because, for the first time since her mother's death, she had forgotten herself for others, and she felt, as she sought her own room that evening, that in truth a better life for her had begun. The past months had all been a mistake; she now saw that life had not exhausted all its duties; she might yet be use- ful and happy. And, for the first time, in recognizing and admitting her own selfishness -for selfishness it was -Clyde understood and was grateful for the full extent of the consideration her aunt had shown her, and she silently resolved that no one in future should have cause to reproach her with the same fault. Her aunt had given her a daughter's place; - she would try hard henceforth to play a daughter's,part. And that night Clyde's slumbers were sweet. Why? For two reasons, -the consciousness of duty well per- formed, and the knowledge of her good resolutions for the future. Clyde knew she had beelllwrong. She deterniined to make amends for it. It was a great step gained; for when we see and acknowledge our faults, and resolve-to overcome them in the future, the battle is already half won.    CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         45 CHAPTER IV. Edi LLEN. Standing, with reluctant feet, Where the brook and river meet, Womanhood and childhood fleet. - LONGFELLOW. CLYDE'S newly-formed resolutions were to be more useful to her than she had at first antici- pated. Ellen's fall from her horse--which they first supposed would have no results more serious than were comprised in her fainting fit, and perhaps a few days confinement to her room- proved more severe in its consequences than any-one, even Dr. Lewis, had at first expected. Ellen had complained of no acute pain, but only of a dull, weary aching, a listlessness and disinclination to move, which the doctor had en- couraged, thinking, and indeed saying, that perfect quiet and the maintenance of a recumbent posture would greatly lessen the shock to the nervous system and expedite her recovery. But as day after day went by, bringing no change, and Ellen still lay on her bed, refusing to move, and saying, in exctse, that the slightest change of position "hurt her so much," while she felt no pain so long as she lay perfectly still, the doctor began to look disturbed, then seriously uneasy; and at last, after a long and careful examina- tion, he told Mr. Bertrand that the nerves of motion in the lower limbs had been considerably affected, and  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7632-00000021"/> "     CLYDE WARDLEIGH that, although he thought it probable that time might work a cure, he considered it but right to state that Ellen was more seriously injured than he had at first thought. Dr. Lewis had wished, and, in fact, advised, that Ellen should be kept in ignorance of her situation. He thought the hope of recovery would greatly assist her in throwing off the partial paralysis--no other word will describe it -which had resulted from her fall, and much depended upon her being kept cheer- ful. But Mr. and Mrs. Bertrand both disagreed with ,him. Accustomed to perfect sincerity and truthful- ness in their dealings with their children, they pre- ferred that Ellen should know all the chances for and against her recovery; and, as carefully as they could, they explained the true state of the case to her. It was a terrible shock to Ellen at first -to know that this inaction--which she had at first supposed was a result of her fall, which would only last d short time - might possibly be for life, that for long, weary years she might be a prisoner to her bed, and that the absence of pain --for which she had at first been so thankful -was one of the most unfavorable symptoms of her case. And yet they gave her hope, --it might be that she would recover; and Ellen tried to forget that other dreadful possibility, and clung to this hope as only the, powers of sixteen can. And why not? There was a chance for her recovery, and she would not despair until she must. Her helplessness had one good result; it brought   CLYDE WARDLEIGH .        47 Clyde and herself together as nothing else could have done. It had at once effectually destroyed the bar- riers that Clyde herself had built up between them,- had made them sisters --perhaps even more than sis- ters-to each other; for sometimes that relationship- which should imply and bring with it the sweetest, truest friendship which can exist between woman and woman-is embittered and spoiled by jealousy and indifference. The affections cannot always be con- trolled and forced into fixed channels. The tie of blood - which we cannot help, and for which we are not responsible - is not always the chief tie; and we may often find more sincere attachment, and more real congeniality, in persons upon whom we have no claim of relationship, than we can win from those from whom we might think we had the most reason to expect them. Those who are members of the same family-who have, or should have, the same interests, the same memories, the same hopes and fears, and yet, living, as they do, under the same roof, sharing the same care, bearing the same name, meeting day after day at the same table, kneeling at the same family- altar, and uniting in the performance of the same round of household duties are, in feeling, taste, and inclinations, set as widely apart as though no tie of blood connected them. This, however, would hardly have occurred in any household under Mrs. Bertrand's control. Her gentle tact would have united and combined even conflicting elements into one harmonious whole. But the feeling  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7632-00000022"/> 48     CLYDE WARDLEIGtH. which now grew up between the two young cousins was a true friendship-one which would grow stronger  with every passing year, and only end with life. Pity and gratitude had actuated Clyde at first; compassion and sympathy had been Ellen's first feelings. And as, whether we will or not, we become attached to any thing that is fond of us and that we take in charge, so, when Clyde took upon herself to wait on and amuse her cousin, the task, undertaken in fulfilment of her good resolutions, soon became a pleasure; and before long there grew up a strong feeling of love for the girl now so dependent upon her for companionship. But this affection between the cousins was not the growth of one day. It is true that at Clyde's first coming Ellen's heart had warmed towards the slight, frail girl, in her deep mourning, who had come to share her home; and most gladly would she have sought her cousin's friendship. But Clyde's conduct had for a time repelled her. (Affection, like a delicate plant or flower, when once chilled, is slow to revive; yet it can be restored, particularly when the parties concerned are willing and anxious to make amends for past errors and the friendship and affection which now grew up between Ellen Bertrand and Clyde Ward- leigh was perhaps all the truer and stronger because there' had been some little hesitation at its beginning; but before the June roses faded, Ellen complained no longer that her cousin did not love her. So the days grew into weeks and months, until sum- mer came. It was July, and the Bertrands still lin-   CLYDE WARDLEIGI.         49 'gered in the city, which they had always been in the habit of leaving, on the approach of warm weather; but the impossibility of removing Ellen---the doctor still insisting upon perfect quiet for her-detained them. There is nothing for the young that is harder to bear than forced inaction. The blood rushes so rapidly through the veins, the very consciousness of living is in itself a joy; there is a spring and elasticity about the system which rebels against all quiet: and we all know that no severer punishment can be inflicted upon a child than confinement in one position. It was hard for Ellen, with youth so strong within her; but at last a favgrable change took place. The nerves of sensation, so long paralyzed - for months of confinement, in the heyday and springtime of life, pass slowly as years similarly spent in its autumnal decline -began to recover some of their lost powers; and at last Dr. Lewis pronounced the welcome opin- ion: that a reaction had begun, and that youth and a good constitution - the latter unfortunately rare now- adays-would eventually triumph.  It would take time; there would be much pain to endure, much pa- tience necessary, both from Ellen and her nurses, but in the end all would be repaid. It was with feelings of the deepest thankfulness that Mrs. Bertrand listened to the physician's encouraging words. But when she repeated them to her daughter, she was wholly unprepared for the burst of tears with which they were received. 5         D  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7632-00000023"/> 60      CLYDE WARDLEIGH. It was a day in the first week in July; a day as yet young, for on the gossamer webs of the spiders and on the blades of grass there still lingered and glistened the bright dew-drops of the night before; here and there in the garden, on which the library opened, a few roses were still in bloom, though the rich profusion they had worn in June was over; geraniums, in their rich clusters of blossom, fairly rivalled the tall spikes of gladiolus in brilliancy of color; fair white lilies held up pure chalices of perfume; verbenas trailed their flowery stems in variegated garlands over the borders; clove-pinks filled the air with their spicy odors; helio- trope and mignonette and sweet alyssum grew in pro- fusion; fuchsias swung their graceful bells; through the long pendulous branches of the willow-tree, which grew near the plashing fountain in the centre of the grounds, a golden-winged oriole was flitting, followed closely by his four dingy young ones, only a day since escaped from their hanging nest. Bees hummed mer- rily around the hollyhock's tall stalks, one or two of which grew not far from the flower-borders, or else buzzed about the red and white clover-heads, which peeped up here and there in the close, soft grass, neglecting for these humbler beauties the gayer, yet scentless flowers of the border. Little. Georgie and Mina were sitting on the greensward near the foun- tain, the noise of whose falling waters fell pleasantly on the ear, while its light spray cooled the air. Ellen's low couch, to which her father's careful arms lifted her tenderly every morning, had been wheeled out upon   CLYtE WARDLEI -H.        51 the shady piazza, and Clyde sat upon a low step near it, pretending to read, but in reality dividing her at- tention between Ellen, and little George. Mrs. Ber- trand; seeing that Ellen after the burst of tears--to which reference has been made-had grown calmer, had left the two girls, in order that she might attend to her own household duties; and after shechad gone, there was a long silence between the cousins, only broken by the clear notes of the oriole, Georgie's merry laugh, or the shrill song of the canary, hanging in his cage above their heads. The conversation began by Ellen's speaking to her cousin. "You must have thought me very foolish, Clyde." "No," was the quiet reply, " for I fully understood your feelings." "To cry for what I was glad of," Ellen said, half to herself " it seems almost a contradiction of one's self." "Or, as Georgie said to me, 'so funny.'" "Don't it! that sorrow and joy should alike express themselves in tears. But oh, Clyde! you cannot un- derstand what a relief it was; and I had tried so very hard all along to control myself, for I did not want to worry mother any more than I could help; so that when she told me I should get well after all, I just broke down at once. You know I had scarcely even allowed myself to hope." "You have been very patient, Nell." "Don't praise me, Clyde, for I don't deserve it. Just before mother came I was thinking that it was  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7632-00000024"/> 52     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. \ so hard I could not even play with Georgie --thinking that I should like to catch 'bumblers, as Mina calls them, in the hollyhock-flowers for him, and run around as I once used to, instead of lying here, useless, helpless, a trouble to myself and to others. Clyde, I was cross, and then I didn't want to play the part of one of Miss Yonge's pet characters, and bring anything like novel into daily life." "I don't exactly understand." "Oh, yes, you do, if you would only think. You've read all her books, I know; for don't you remember how ashamed you were because you cried over the ' Heir of Redcliffe?' - poor Guy! Don't you know how fond she is of people on their backs? There's Margaret May, in the 'Daisy Chain,' and Erminia, in the 'Clever Woman,' -you surely must recollect." I do now; but then Erminia was very happy, and made herself a name, and - " "And I never could; it's not in me, Clyde. I am very commonplace and matter-of-fact; and I must say I had .much rather get well and be nobody than lie here romantically and be somebody." "But you will get well after awhile, Nell!' "I know, and I cannot be too thankful for it. However, my accident has had one good result, - it has taught us to know and love one another as-we probably never should have done without it." "And that was my fault," Clyde interposed, half to herself. "What does it, matter, since it is all right now?'   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        53 Ellen said, noticing the shade on her cousin's brow. "Clyde, when I thought, as we all did, that I might die," - the girl's voice softened at the word, -" it was my chief comfort to think that were I gone, my father and mother would not be left so wholly alone, still having you." "Ellen! Ellen! please hush!"Clyde pleaded, kneeling by her cousin's side. "I can guess what you would say, but, indeed, I don't deserve it. I only tried to do my duty. I would have been a monster of ingratitude had I done less." "Don't we know how hard it all was for you, Clyde? Your feelings have changed now. There! 'll say no more, you poor sensitive plant! Let us talk instead of the immense stock of patience I must have on hand, and my nurses too, during the next two years. I wonder whose will hold out best. Only, Clyde, I do hate giving up my music." "Two years is not a lifetime, Nell; they will pass quicker than you may imagine." ".No; but a long time to wait, a long time to lie here helplessly, a long. time to bear pain, a long time to try and be patient." "But we will all help you to wait and be patient, Nell; you will-just think-be the very centre and heart of the establishment! Why, you will be such a very important personage that - who knows?- all our petting and taking care of you may make you unbearably selfish!" And the affectionate, playful tone of the speaker made her words very caressing. 65*  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7632-00000025"/> "  -  CLYDE WARDLEIGH. They had the desired effect,--they brought a smile to Ellen's lips. "Not with you for an example, Clyde. Why, Georgie," as the child came to her side,-" what is the matter now?" "I want a big, pretty bumbler, Kydie; come catch him for Georgie." "And have him sting Kydie, Georgie?"Ellen asked. "Do you think that would be fair?  "You come, then," the boy said, roguishy. "Why for you don't never get up, Nelly? why for you lie here so lazy?  "Why for, Georgie? I only wish I could get up." "I only go to bed when I s'eepy," Georgie re- marked, sagaciously. "And you don't always want to go then?"Clyde said, taking him up in her arms. "I think somebody is 's'eepy' now." "It ain't Georgie," pulling Clyde's long curls. "The b'ack dark not come yet; -but Kydie can tell Georgie a 'toly." So Clyde, dismissing Mina to her work, sat down  again, with Georgie in her lap, to repeat to him rhyme after rhyme from the works of that favorite poet of children, the renowned Mother Goose. And, half an hour later, when Mrs. Bertrand came out again on the piazza, she found that Ellen, exhausted by the morn- ing's emotions, had fallen asleep, and Georgie, his fair cheeks flushed, his rosy lips apart, his soft, light hair curling on his brow, lay--a perfect picture of childish   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         55 grace -quietly asleep in his cousin's lap. clyde her- * self seemed lost in reverie, -girls of sixteen will in- dulge in day-dreams, -and Mrs. Bertrand quietly withdrew without disturbing her. The morning wore on; the light breeze died away; the air grew full of that warm, oppressive stillness so characteristic of the noontide of a July day; the cheer- ful whistle of the oriole was hushed; even the canary had ceased his song, and only the occasional chirp of a sparrow came to mingle with the low buzz and hum of insect-life, which even in the hottest summer days is not wholly still; and yet Clyde sat there, watching over her two sleeping cousins, and dreaming the sweet day-dreams in which girlhood loves to indulge. "Miss Clyde, s'pose you give me Master Georgie, and you go into your dinner," Mina's voice at last interrupted. "It's powerful hot the day, ain't it?  "I have been cooler," Clyde said, as she transferred Georgie to Mina's arms. "Don't let the flies trouble him, Mina, and if Miss Ellen wakes, call me." "I don't see the use of its bein' so hot,- it's most too hot to eat," Mina said; "nor of flies," as she drove one of those pertinacious insects from Georgie's face. "I just-would like to know what they was made for, Miss Clyde." "I suppose for some good purpose, Mina." "Laws 'ee! I thought you'd know everrythin' Miss Clyde!  But if you don't know, I guess IL don't, neither. Only, theys don't know how to behave themselves.

Clyde? 4erhaps if they just had a Bible already,  they'd learn better manners; ell, Miss Clyde?      t  But this was unanswerable; and Clyde, afraid of laughing and thereby insulting Mina, made her escape. / "She is decidedly unique," Clyde said, speaking to  Ellen. "As original as Topsy, that most original of darkies. Where her ideas come from, I can't imag- ine, unless, like the afore-mentioned Topsy, 'they growed.'  Mina's remark to herself was: "Well, I do declare! I just thought that Miss Clyde she knowed everythin'; but, laws'ee me! she does n't know what 's the use of flies, except to sting! There now, I just might 'a caught that there big bum- bler for Master Georgie, after all!

THERE are but few persons who have not, at some period or other of their lives, acknowledged that this old saying, like many of its kind, which in a few words epitomize the wisdom and experience of ages, has more of truth than fiction in it. The events of   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         57 life have so much sameness and repetition i them- going on, and moving over and over and over again, like the earth on which we live, in the same circle- that one would think, in this nineteenth century of ours, we should be prepared for, and be ready to meet, everything-be surprised at nothing-and, guided by the landmarks set up by those who have passed over the road before us, avoid their mistakes, and escape the troubles which befell them. But no; we each and a4 of us must learn for ourselves; we must each taste of the bitter fruit knowledge proves. And although we may, and do, repeat these musty old proverbs to our- selves over and over again, it is with a secret doubt as to their truth. We ourselves have not tested them; because these things have happened to others, it does not follow that they must happen to us. There are exceptions to every rule; our case, we think, may prove an exception. But misfortune is something from which none of us can ever hope to escape. Troubles follow one another. If Death enters a household, he is rarely, if ever, sat- isfied with one victim. He may pass us by, seemingly forgetting us, for years, and then suddenly we find that ours was but a, fancied security, and the blows that fall are all the harder to bear because they were unexpected, all the more overwhelming because of the long period of calm which has preceded them. For years Mrs. Bertrand's life had flowed on in calm and tranquillity. The first ripple in the smooth waters had been her sister's death; but that, though  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7632-00000027"/> 58      CLYDE WARDLEIGH. it was at the time a shock, was one of comparatively short duration. It was not that Mrs. Bertrand was indifferent to her sister; but, in the long, unbridged years of their separation, they had, as it were, fallen apart. New ties, new interests, new feelings had re- placed, as is but natural, the old ones; and it is unde- niably true, that although the home affections may be strengthened by short absences, in very few cases- and those exceptional ones-will they bear the test of long protracted separation. The mere tie of blood is not sufficient; it needs the aid of the sweet human- ities of daily life, of daily contact, of daily intercourse; and although Ellen apd Margaret Clyde had been devoted and affectionate sisters, yet the years of non- intercourse between Mrs. Wardleigh and Mrs. Ber- trand had greatly lessened, to the latter, the shock of her sister's death. It had made no void in her life, left no blank in her daily companionship; its only visible effect was that it had given her a daughter, and one who, in spite of her early doubts, fully deserved that place. Mrs. Bertrand had reproached herself for not feeling the loss of her sister more acutely. She forgot that the bitterest pang was over when they learned that Ellen Clyde had left her father's and sister's affection and care, to trust to the untried love of a stranger - that had dulled the sting of any future sorrow she might cause them. And so Mrs. Wardleigh's death had been as the mere shadow of a passing cloud over the calm sun- shine of her sister's life. A far, far greater trial had   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         59 come to her in Ellen's accident, the sudden shock of which-coming upon her, as it did, without any warn- ing - had made her, for the moment, as helpless as her child; and even when all danger was over, and she had Ellen's future recovery to which she might look forward, it was very hard for the mother to see her once gay and lively girl lie; pale and suffering, upon her bed. With that spirit of self-sacrifice and unselfish devotion which so largely enters into and makes the love a mother bears for her children the truest, purest, holiest emotion of which the human heart is capable, Mrs. Bertrand would gladly have borne all, and more than all, her daughter's suffering, to have spared her the pain, and to have seen her once more, as of old, joining in the home duties and pleasures. But this trouble was one which was tem- pered by hope. It was, Mrs. Bertrand thought after- wards, comparatively easy to endure; it was something which would not last always, and which, when past, would leave no trace of itself behind. During Ellen's illness, little Georgie was the light, as Clyde was the stay, of the house. He was a very sunbeam in their midst, ever active and cheerful, and his merry ways and bright little sayings, his sweet, affectionate disposition, made him the pet of the fam- ily. Yet he was not spoiled, strange to say, in the least degree. He was one of those loving and lov- able childrengwho are governed solely through their affections-full of life, gladness, and spirit. There were many hopes centred in little Georgie, many plans  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7632-00000028"/> 60     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. made' for his future. To Clyde, to his mother, there was no music sweeter than his joyous laugh, no sound dearer than was the patter. of those little feet running to meet them. He might, unrebuked, tangle Clyde's long curls or upset her workbox, he might climb int6 her lap when he would, -she was only too glad to feel those soft, clinging arms around her neck, only too willing to do all in her power to amuse him. Mrs. Bertrand laughed at Clyde for her untiring devotion to her little cousin, telling her she would spoil him; but she would only smile in reply, and say: "Aunt Margaret, I'll quote Mina, and tell you it 'would be an unpossibility to spoil him.'" And then Ellen would laugh, and say, playfully: "I think mother pets Georgie quite as much as any of us do; indeed, I sometimes think seriously of get, ting jealous." "Don't say that, Ellen, even in jest," Mrs. Bertrand once said to her. ("I know no difference in my love for my children; they are both equally dear to me. Only, Georgie being the youngest and smallest, he, perhaps, is the most petted; but the affection is the same, though it may be the more openly shown in the one case than in the other." "As if I ever, even for one moment, doubted your love for me, mother dear," Ellen replied, "or grudged Georgie his being petted. Dear little fellow! I don't wonder that everybody loves him!" "And Georgie loves everybody," said the child, who had come in just in time to hear Ellen's last words.    CLYDE WARDLEIGH..        61 That was the secret; affection will win affection in return. But a day came at last-a day in that same July- when, though Georgie was taken up and dressed as usual -in the morning, his merry little laugh was silent, his pretty feet refused to carry him about the house. He was "so tired, so sleepy," he said; "would ri't Kydie or mamma p'ease hold him, and kiss his head to make it well." But all the holding and kissing Georgie got that day did not help the "so tired" feelings, nor did it make the "s'eepy" head well.  He lay still and quiet, in a sort of drowsy stupor, alternating with fever flushes of heat, till they all longed for the cool of evening to come to give the little fellow some relief from the oppressive air of July, which even the older ones could scarcely bear uncomplainingly. And then it seemed such a long, long, empty day -with no little feet stirring, no child voice sounding, bird-like, in their ears; everything was in such painfully good order, with no little soft hands to scatter toys over the floor! It seemed, Clyde said to her uncle when she sought his good-night kiss, as though all the life had gone out of the house; and yet it only was that Geor- gie was not very well! Not very well! That was what they said for a few days, each successive day hoping there would be a change, each night saying to one another that it would all be well in the morning. But one to-morrow after another came and added itself to the long list of yesterdays, and Georgie'was 6  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7632-00000029"/> 682  -CLYDE WARDLEIGH, no better! It is a sad, sad thing to see a sick child-- to know that yoli cannot relieve it, that it cannot tell you what it wants or what ails it; to hear the little loved voice call, so piteously;.on her to whom the baby has been accustomed to look for the chief care the little life has known: to see this precious little life growing' feebler day after day, and yet to pray and strive-- only a mother knows how earnestly, how painfully- to hold and keep the darling, slowly yet surely slip- ping away from our loving clasp. It is an old sorrow, yet none the less hard to endure because many be- ' fore us have borne all its pangs, because many beside ourselves have had to give up their precious little human blossoms around which so many hopes and affections have fondly clustered. -Yet as long as the little heart beats, as long as your child is conscious of your care and clings to you, you still hope -you can- not, will not think that this terrible trouble can be coming upon you, that this part of your life is to be taken away from you! So, day after day the family hung around little Georgie's bed. Day after day, the life within the lit- tle form grew feebler and fainter; and at last Dr. Lewis, his own voice trembling as he spoke, told them that all which could be done had been done, and that he could not even say to them that while there was life there was hope, that poor form of words which has been as a knell of despair to so many, - but here there was no hope; Georgie, dear little Georgie, must die! They did not realize it -they could not. It is at   CLYDE WA'RDLEIGH.        63 such times that we most fully understand our own utter helplessness and weakness, in our inability to save and to protect those we love. So feeling, all through, that day they who loved the child watched around his bed, expecting, yet dreading, to see the last breath struggle through the parted lips. No tears were shed by the anxious watchers; theirs was a grief too deep for tears. It was almost more than the father and mother could bear, knowing, as they did, that every passing moment only brought the end nearer, and that they were powerless to avert it. But they were spared the pain of seeing their darling suffer; he lay motionless in a sort of stupor, only the slight rise and fall of the little breast showing that life still lingered within its citadel, the heart; and as the day waned, they who watched could see that even this faint token of vitality was waning with it; and the silence in the roo - only broken by Mina's low, suppressed sobs--grew more still and solemn, and over them all came that strange, inexplicable awe which the presence of the Unseen and Inevitable brings - which comes over us when we know that the wings of the Great Reaper are hovering over our home. The windows of the apartment had all been thrown widely open to admit every wandering breath of air. It had been a dull, murky afternoon, but just as the sun touched the verge of the western horizon, a few faint rays struggled through the surrounding clouds and fell, in subdued glory, on little Georgie's bed. As though in reply to some message they bore, only heard  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7632-00000030"/> "     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. by and intended for the child, the blue-veined lids opened once more, and the soft violets of his eyes rested upon his mother. Then the lips parted: "Is the b'ack dark come .yet, mamma? Georgie s'eepy! Papa, Kydie, Nellie, good-night!" Then the little hands folded themselves as though for prayer, the lips moved, and Clyde, bending over the beloved boy, heard, in low, feeble accents, a few words from the verse with which, every night, Georgie lay down to rest: "Now I lay me down to s'eep, P'ay the Lord my soul to keep." And then the sweet eyes closed; there was one low, fluttering breath, and then! And then they who were left desolate because he awas not," might say to themselves: "It is well with the child." Intense sorrow cannot be described. Those who have not known it - for here and there persons may be found who are incapable of feeling it -think the words applied to it exaggerated and overstrained. Those who have passed through it and felt its dark shadow, its bitter pang, know that nothing can de- pict it. And yet it is only the common fate of all, only the every-day occurrence in this sad world of ours, the fashion old as the world itself, beginning, even as Love began, with the first years of the world; yet the   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.          6t pain, of it is never dulled, this the hardest of all pains to bear, the bitterest of all suffering to endure! The cry of all to whom it comes--the old, old trial, which none may hope to escape - is, "No sorrow-is like unto my sorrow." For a part of ourself is taken away; it is a rending of our very heart-strings when we think there is no little Georgie now! H-e, the light of the home - he, the cherished dar- ling, -,- can it be that he lies there, all cold and still, unconscious of our falling tears, our bitter agony,- receiving, not returning, as of old, our passionate kisses! Will the soft little arms never again be folded lovingly around the mother's neck? is the sweet voice, sweeter than music in our earS, forever still? It cannot, cannot be! He must, he will awaken; and yet, even as we say this to 'ourselves, the sad reality, the mournful truth grows upon us, that the fair waxen image is all that is left to us of our heart's treasure; that he is no longer ours, but set apart from us where we cannot follow him; for the solemn ma- jesty of Death has touched and consecrated him, making him greater, wiser than we are; for he has passed the viewless portals. The great mysteries hid- den from us are no longer mysteries to him; he is greater than a king, wise as are the angels! And here, the little life is over, its mission fulfilled. Nothing ever can, or ever will, take Georgie's place in their home, in their hearts, or in their memories. He is only a name now; that is the saddest thought of all. For other homes may hold among their cher- O6*         E  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7632-00000031"/> "     CLYDE WARDLEIGtH ished jewels other little Georgies; but to Clyde, to Ellen, to the mother, that name is something sacred, something hvly, something which belongs to their lost darling only, and only to him,- a name which Mrs. Bertrand will never hear spoken by mothers of living children without a pang, because for her it means only what once was, because he who once bore it is now gone from her; his little form, once warmly, ten- derly cradled in her loving arms, now sleeps in a cold and narrow bed under the little grassy mound which is to her as the shrine inclosing some holy relic, because upon the stone at its head is carved the name once spoken in her home, the only token left on earth of the child that was, but is not-the flower transplanted to Eden, the lamb folded in the arms of the Shep- herd-the angel Georgie. But not now does the con- solation of that thought come. That is given later. For at first, all we can think of, all we can remember, all we are conscious of, is the stillness of the house, the emptiness of our arms, the dull, aching void in our hearts, the missing crown ofour lives; our only thought is this-that it is all over now! It is all over now. All that is left of him in their home is a memory; his only token on the earth is a tiny mound in Laurel Hill, Loving' hands prepared him for his last sleep; Clyde and his mother would not allow this last sad duty to pass to others.

No child in the house! no little Georgie to throw the sweet blessing and poem of childhood around the stern realities of life,-it is harder to bear than though he had never come to them-to think that of the young, joyous life which brightened four brief summers, of its bright promise for the future, of their many hopes, there is nothing left save a mem-: ory and a grave!

YO one, save .they who themselves have felt it, can understand the utter void that the death of a child makes in a house, and more particularly in one whose inmates are all grown men and women save the little bud whose promise has been thus early blighted. A child under these circumstances always becomes the central point of the family- the one thing most in common to all. It had been thus in the Bertrand household, and little Georgie's death was a blow from ":: which its members would not soon recover, a grief which would not be speedily forgotten. It was, perhaps, well for all of them that Ellen's grief for her brother's death had so weakened and thrown her back that she needed the utmost care and attention. They could scarcely leave her for a mo- ment. She grew nervous, irritable, and excitable; and the. endeavor to soothe her grief- the indulgence in which would have been most dangerous-in her   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         69 present weak condition - and the effort to be cheerfill- for her sake, aided the others wonderfully in bearing their own sorrow unrepiningly. Together, Clyde and Mrs. Bertrand had laid away all of Georgie's possessions. The little garments he had worn, the tiny shoes, the toys with which he had played, - everything was collected and laid away as tenderly as though they were precious relics. Yet they did not put him away from among them, - they spoke of him as lovingly as ever; his name was men- tioned as frequently as of old. He was still their child, their-darling - of them yet not among them,- only parted from therm by a little space. It is strange how differently we hold the memory of the dead. With some of us they are an ever- present reality; they are spoken of as if, though un- seen, they yet formed part of our home circle, as in truth they do; they are spoken of gently and ten- derly, and yet with an added sacredness, because they "were" and "are not"; as though we realized that they have only passed from us into and entered the higher life of which this earth is, as it were, but a vestibule. Others, again, put them away out of their speech and their thoughts, as though they never had existed. Their names are, as it were, dropped out of the home record; the room in which the last breath was drawn is closed up and never used. Should any allusion be made, even incidentally, to the departed, it casts a gloom over the survivors. Can it be that this is prompted by a feeling of remorse-bythe fear that  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7632-00000033"/> 70      CLYDE WARDLEIGH. while they lived they did not receive all due affection, all true kindness? Or is it but another form of the feeling. which makes us all lay away from our sight such things as they have used, and makes us, even' after the lapse of years, shrink from using them our- selves as their former owners used then? For one long year after Georgie's death they scarcely -even dared to hope for Ellen. More feeble, more helpless than a child, they could only wait, they could only give her all the tender, patient care that true affection can alone enable us to bestow. But how, through this year, did it fare with. Clyde's resolutions? It is easy enough to be unselfish and to forget ourselves when others are in trouble, easy enough to deny ourselves then for their sakes, even as we can more bravely endure one great trial than many small ones. And so, those who in the petty troubles and annoyances of daily life--which make, after all, the best- test of character-may be restless, dislatisfied, and discontented, may, when called upon by the pres- sure of circumstances, exert themselves for others in a way which will surprise every one, and then, when the incentive is removed, fall back into their original inertness. But it was not thus with Clyde. Once roused, her conduct was consistent. With her, to de- termine upon any fixed course was to carry it out per- sistently, despite all obstacles and regardless of what it might cost her. Little Georgie's affection had been the first thing to touch the girl's heart, and now that' he was gone, his work accomplished, all the love Clyde   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         71 had given him was now added to that which she felt for her aunt and for Ellen. During the latter's ill- ness she was alike their comfort and their stay. Mrs. eBertrand relied and depended upon her as if she had, in truth, been her own child; and Ellen, - the love she now gave her cousin is not' easily described. Such perfect sympathy, such unity of feeling existed be- tween the two girls, that praise given to the one was felt by the other as being given to herself. There was no pleasure for the one unless the other shared it; and not for one moment--though Clyde had, as it were, slipped into Ellen's place in paying to Mr. and Mrs, Bertrand those pleasant little attentions which come so gracefully from a child to a parent -did the latter feel even the slightest jealousy of her. During the three long years for which she lay a prisoner to her couch, not for one moment did Ellen regret Clyde's entrance into her home. Everything was in common between them; in all, save the name, they were sisters. At last the shock caused by Georgie's death seemed to wear off, and Ellen began slowly to improve. It was then that, after a long talk with his wife, Mr. Bertrand sent for Clyde, and, passing his arm caress- ingly around her, he told her that they wished to make her in truth their daughter by adoption, and to give her their name. "Take your own time to think about it, Clyde," her- uncle said, seeing that she. hesitated about her reply. "It would gratify us more than we can tell you to  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7632-00000034"/> 72     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. have you as one of us, not only in our hearts but in our name." But Clyde made no reply. She only raised her uncle's hand to her lips, and gently releasing herself from his embrace, after a vain effort at self-control, she rushed from the room, and never stopped until she threw herself on her knees by Ellen's couch, where, hiding her face, she burst into a flood of passionate tears. It was so different from what Ellen had anticipated -for she knew what her father's intention had been, and she had so eagerly looked forward to the moment in which she was to be permitted to speak to Clyde, and call her Clyde Bertrand-that it had been almost impossible for her to refrain from mentioning the sub- ject. She had thought and hoped that it would give her cousin the same pleasure it gave her, and, instead of this, to see Clyde, her slight form shaken with sobs and tears, Clyde's rare tears streaming down her cheeks, - for, unlike most girls, these springs, which usually overflow at a word, were not easily moved, - Ellen could only look on in wonder and half fright- ened, and beg Clyde to tell her what it was or could be, in a matter which would give them all so much pleasure, that so deeply pained her. It required an effort for Clyde to speak, but the words came at last, interrupted and made indistinct by emotion. For the first time since she had shared that home, she voluntarily alluded to her mother. Only once more in all the years of their close comn-   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         73 panionship did Ellen hear her mention her mother's name. "Ellen! Ellen! I can not do' it! I must not! Tell Aunt Margaret and Uncle Bertrand so for me, for I could not! I wish I could! I know how ungrateful it is in me to refuse; but even to please them- even for their sake, and to bear theirs-I cannot give up my mother's name. It is all I have left of her now. I promised her to keep it. If only you knew how much it pained me to refuse this token of your love. It is not that I do not love you all; but"--Ellen caught the words spoken in a lower tone-"I must keep my own--without it I might be tempted to forget." They saw that Clyde was in earnest about her re- fusal. They were unwilling to give her pain by urging her, and their request evidently pained her; and so the subject was dropped. And after all, as Ellen said, "What did the name matter? Clyde was just as dear to her as Clyde Wardleigh as she possibly could be as Clyde Bertrand." The years intervening between the ages of fifteen and eighteen are usually the most uneventful years of a girl's life. They are, to use the only word which will describe them, transitional years, forming the pas- sage from childhood to womanhood. Too old for the one, too young: for the other, the candid opinion of every one who has passed through them would be, were the truth told, that they are anything but pleas- ant years.

Her girl- hood will, and must, as it does in all cases, - in some pore than in others,- influence her womanhood.

It is but another form of the old, old story I Will its ending please you? Who can say? CHAPTER VII. FOUR YEARS LATER. As Childhood went, Came Maidenhood's more tender grace And thoughtfil sentiment. THE curtain rises again after four years, - four years, during which Ellen Bertrand had at last been re- stored to health, and she and Clyde Wardleigh .had passed from girlhood into early womanhood. It was just one year since the two girls had entered society,- had gone through the usual routine of balls, parties,   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         75 and other entertainments, had spent the summer in travelling, had read, visited, and enjoyed themselves: Ellen, perhaps, the most, because she had so long been debarred from everything. In saying this the story of a year has been told; and some lives have no higher aim, no better occupation, than can be found in what is mentioned in this brief paragraph. It was a dark, dreary morning late in November,  a day of no sun yet of no rain, but a day of intense, penetrating cold. And yet there was not a breath of wind stirring; everything was calm,-the air so very still that the smoke from thechimneys rose in smooth, unbroken, unmoving columns, until it melted imper- ceptibly into the low, overhanging, and threatening gray of the sky,--a day on which only those who were compelled to go out were on the streets, and the most intimate friends only passed each other with tie brief- est salutation. There was no loitering at the corners, there were no gay promenaders filling and enlivening the street with their jaunty costumes; for it was a day on which no one who could avoid it would leave the summer-like temperature which modern improvements have enabled us to keep up, even in mid-winter, within our houses. To go out from choice, to meet the-pen- etrating, icy, arctic chill of all out-doors, -a chill which sought in every way to gain admission, and which seemed to go through and through you, which lay in wait outside of every door and ambushed every window, which made you feel that even a tiny streak of blue sky, a single ray of sunshine, were things to be  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7632-00000036"/> 76     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. desired and longed for just because they were bright,- a day which made you wish to put on the gayest, warmest colors your wardrobe could afford, because they would give you something cheerful and warm- looking to see in contrast with the pervading gloom and the bitter St. Agnes' weather,--a day too cold even for the street beggars, too dull for the business men, who must yet be at their posts, and who think of and look forward longingly to the cheerful homes, the bright firesides, the pleasant evening awaiting them after the long hours of work and business are over. God help those who have no happy homes, no cheerful firesides of their own to look forward to, or to seek at any time, - more prized on such days as this. But, gloomy and dreary and dull as the day was out of doors, it made the pleasant library of the Ber- trands all the more cheerful from very force of con- trast. The bright gleams from the well-filled low grate, with the reflections from the rich, warm crim- son of the carpet, heavy curtains, and soft velvet cov- ering the chairs and lounges, seemed to fill the whole room with a sort of wintry sunshine. From the con- sertatory, which opened into the library, there came the sweet odors of flowers; every now and then the sweet song of a canary thrilled through the room; and where all was so pleasant within, it was hard to realize that out-of-doors November wore his very dreariest, chillienl aspect. On either side of the grate sat Clyde Wardleigh and Ellen Bertrand, the first carelessly turning over the   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         "7 leaves of a book, the second busied with some dainty needle-work. Of the two girls, Ellen was by far the most handsome. In complexion, a rich, glowing bru- nette, -bright, flashing black eyes, hair black and glossy as the raven's wing, scarlet lips, a tall, well- developed figure, - as Ellen Bertrand, in her crimson mering dress and a ribbon of the same hue binding her hair, leaned carelessly back in the soft recesses o the sleepy-hollow chair she occupied, she was a spl- did specimen of a not uncommon type of American beauty. But what was there so very attra tive in Clyde Wardleigh's face?' It was not beauty; that Clyde could lay no claim. It was something more than that,--soul, expression, fascination,-something indescribably winning, for which men, to .seek her side, neglected other girls, more lovely than Clyde with the loveliness of American women-confessedly the most -beautiful women in the world,- and yet in Clyde Wardleigh's presence their beauty was forgot- ten and unacknowledged. And yet you could not tell where the charm lay; it was something to be felt and not to be described. It was the charm which, in days of chivalry, would have crowned Clyde queen of the tournament, which would have made her a woman for whom, in those romantic days, whose story, as told by the old chroniclers, reads to us now like fiction, -to us, who are more prosaic, more commonplace than they were,- 'would have made her a woman for whonm lances would have been shivered and knights have fought a l'outrance, counting themselves well paid with a 7*  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7632-00000037"/> 78.  -  CLYDE WARDLEIGH. smile from her lips, an approving glance from her eye. It was the charm which made Mme. Recamier a queen, as it were; not, to be sure, wearing the often burden- some symbols of what is only royalty in name, the heavy ermined mantle bearing down the feeble shoul- ders, the dazzling crown pressing-upon and binding an often aching head, - but a queen by a nobler right, a queen of society, winning many hearts to her. Such was Clyde's charm; and yet, with all this winsome- ness, a very woman, her very womanliness being her chief attraction, the more powerful, perhaps, that- shame to the sex though it be to write it, the truth must still be told - in this nineteenth century of ours women strive to lay aside, as being old-fashioned and out of date, the retiring delicacy and graceful mod- esty which once were -should be, are-- the crowning and richest ornaments of their womanhood, and take in their stead the tinsel of the freedom, boldness, and independence of the so-called girl of the period. Yet, compared with her cousin, who was really handsome, Clyde was no beauty. But, looking into her eyes, -such wonderful eyes, - you forgot the irreg- ularity of feature, the pure, pale complexion was tn- noticed, the sweet expression of the mouth escaped observation; for those marvellous eyes absorbed you,- eyes of the deepest, richest blue, true violet eyes, such eyes as are rarely seen, with a far-off, dreamy look in their velvety-purple softness, as though the in-dwell- ing soul, looking out through her two windows, gazed away afar, searching, inquiri inito the hereafter,-   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         79 eyes with an untold mournfulness in their glorious liquid depths, strangely contrasting, in their marvellously rich, royal hue, with the pale gold of her hair, which, in soft, shining masses, crowned her brow with its rip- pling glory. A face, taken altogether, like a flower,- a true pansy face, gold and purple; -and yet more truly a face full of pensees, the sweet French name for that flower, which her face more deserved from the way in which it filled and lingered in your thoughts, and de- scribing it better than did the English name, heart's- ease. Little of that did Clyde's face give you; for, seeing it, those who knew and loved her sometimes wondered if the golden crown of rippling hair was a token that the supremest, noblest crown of woman's life - her truest, dearest kingdom - the wealth of love, the realm of home  the commonest, yet the most blessed lot-would be Clyde's share and partage. So they hoped, yet at times thinking that in its sunny, living brightness- it was such a crown as decked the brows of victims for the sacrifice; for deep in the soft eyes there lay a sadness which told of capabilities for suffering in the soul, yet promised strength to meet it should it come. Such was Clyde Wardleigh at twenty, as she sat, with her more brilliant cousin, this dismal November morning. THer dress was a clear, warm blue, the color she most frequently wore; a ribbon of the same shade was passed through the soft waves of hair. There was a cluster of heliotrope at her breast., It was Clyde's favorite flower; one plant of it in the conservatory  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7632-00000038"/> 80     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. was her own especial charge, and she was seldom seen without a cluster of its tiny, fragrant blossoms. Wher- ever she went, and about all her possessions, a faint breath of its rich, vanilla-like perfume was perceptible. It seemed to linger around her lovingly, as though it were as much a part and belonging of herself as it was of the blossom to which it owed its existence, or as if, as some people say that perfumes are the souls of flowers, the fragrant spirit lovedto be near the mortal who prized it. Presently Clyde laid down her book and walked across the room to the window. The low, gray, murky sky seemed to fascinate her; for she stood gazing upon. it some little time, and at last, as though it had been involuntarily suggested to her by the gloomy day she was looking upon, she began to repeat slowly to her- self the words of "The Rainy Day." "Please don't, Clyde dear!"Ellen said, throwing aside her work and joining her cousin at the window. "How anybody can repeat, much less write, poetry descriptive of such a day as this, is something utterly beyond my powers of comprehension. For my part, I think Noveriber ought to be blotted from the cal- endar of the months." "Poor November!"Clyde said, smiling at Ellen's affected indignation. "Its only fault is being true to itself. You cannot expect sunny skies and soft breezes in the most melancholy days of the year," continued she, casting a glance at the lowering clouds overhead. "But, without being unreasonable, Clyde, one might   CLYDE WARDLE IGH.        81 be permitted to wish for a clear, bright day, consider- ing that it is my birthday, and that our dear five hundred friends are to assemble in honor of that cir- cumstance to-night." "Nell, did you ever cry for the moon when you were a baby?" Ellen laughed. "You wicked girl, to make fun of me! For you carry your own sunshine about with you, and are wholly independent of external influences, my fair sunbeam, who loves dearly to lecture me!" "A poor, pale, wintry sunbeam, if I am one at all," Clyde rejoined; "and as for lecturing -" "' Who talks about lecturing?" interrupted a gen- tleman's voice at their side. "Surely, Clyde would not be guilty of anything so unamiable." The speaker was a slightly-built, fair-haired man of about twenty-seven. At the first glance, you thought him handsome and remarkably attractive; at the second, you were conscious that there was something wanting in his face. What this something was it would be hard to say; it was perhaps an indefinable expression about the mouth-a lack of firmness in its well-cut lined; and yet the clear, steady gray eye seemed to contradict this. It looked at you openly, freely, and unhesitatingly, in strange variance with the wavering, almost feminine mouth, which even the carefully trainedblonde moustache failed wholly to conceal. You only thought of this once, then it was forgotten; for Clarke Henderson possessed the rarely given charm of exquisite tact, and to the instincts of F  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7632-00000039"/> 82     CLYDE WARDLEIaGH. a thorough gentleman he added a most pleasing man- ner, which made him a general favorite. And yet Clarke was very unlike most men, - gentle and sen- sitive as a woman, it was a fortunate thing for him that circumstances had placed him above the necessity of toiling for his daily bread. Adversity would have crushed him; for he had not sufficient stamina, either physically or mentally, to struggle against it. Not that he was wanting at all in intellect, far, very far from that; but some minds are too delicately strung, too refined, too sensitive to bear contact with the rough world and harsher natures, and so it was with him. And, although he was a general favorite, scarcely any one ever spoke of him as Mr. Henderson; it was Clarke, and Clarke only, with very often the adjective "poor" prefixed to the name, yet so spoken that it told of more affection than reproach. Such was the person whom Ellen and Clyde turried to meet with unaffected pleasure, though if there was any difference at all in their manner, it might have been that Ellen's was the most cordial. "Clyde has been scolding me, Clarke," she said; "and I expect you to come to my defence. Because I was only wishing for a bright, clear evening, she sug- gests that I may just as well wish for the nioon." Clyde's low, rippling laugh answered her. "A wilful misrepresentation, Nell. All I meant to imply was;-that summer days and sunny skies are not peculiar to November." ' And I will try to set your mind at rest, Ellen, by   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         83 telling you," Clarke said, "that neither rain, snow, nor hail, wind or weather, will have power to prevent Miss Bertrand's party being well attended to-night. Everybody who pretends to be anybody, including myself, will be here. And by the way, Nell," the three were sufficiently intimate to drop all titles of ceremony and only to use each other's Christian names in familiar conversation, - "that reminds me that Nora entrusted me with a note for you, threatening me with all manner of evil should I forget it or fail to de- liver it." b She knew by sad experience, I suppose, the fate of all notes or letters confided to your pocket-- to be forgotten, gentlemen being proverbially careless about all letters not their own," Ellen said, as she opened the note he handed her. It was from his cousin, Nora Reynolds, who in Clyde's early school-days had concluded she was worth cultivating, and who, consequently, had, become inti- mate with the cousins. It informed Ellen that she had only that morning returned to the city, and, find- ing the invitation awaiting her, she requested permis- sion to bring a friend with her. "Nora delights in little mysteries," Clarke said, carelessly, as Ellen appealed to him for information. "I hate this way of making secrets out of nothing, so will tell you that the 'friend' in question is a gentle- man, who has lately decided to give Philadelphia the benefit of his legal knowledge by settling here; that Nora first met him in New York; that his name is o  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7632-00000040"/> 84     CLYDE WAEDLEIGH. Ralph Bertrand, although he is no relation of yours, Ellen, in spite of the name; but beyond that I can give you no further information." "If it be Ralph Bertrand, you are mistaken about his not being a relation of mine, Master Clarke; for, as it happens, he is my cousin," Ellen said, laughing. "He and his partner, Mr. Robert Haynes, called on father a few days since, and he told me to be sure and send them cards for this evening, which, I am ashamed to say, I had entirely forgotten until Nora's note came. So you may tell her that she certainly must bring her 'friend,' and you may deliver these cards, with the very prettiest apology you can possibly make in my name to Mr. Haynes." "It's a good thing to have a reputation for amia- bility and for being obliging," Clarke observed, in a most resigned tone of voice. "See what it brings upon its possessor. You and Nora order me about as if my whole occupation and use in life were to be at your beck and call." "You submit with a remarkably good grace and exactly as if you liked it. Own up, Clarle; candidly, now, don't you enjoy feeling that you are of some use to somebody, after all? He looked up. Ellen had gone across the room for a moment. "You know I would do anything in the wide world' for you, Clyde, and count myself well paid with one word of thanks, one approving look from you." "I know you are my very good friend and brother,   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         85 Clarke," Clyde said, laying a slight but unmistakable emphasis upon the two nouns in the sentence. "Friend- brother! They are meaningless words, Clyde." ' Words mean nothing, actions prove most," Ellen laughed, coming back to them. "But they can be very prettily combined and spoken by this demure little cousin of mine. Clyde, who knows how this evening will terminate? Let me play fortune-teller, and predict that you and Clarke will meet your fates to-night." "Or that you may meet your own," Clyde said, coming to Clarke's assistance, for he seemed strangely embarrassed at Ellen's careless words. -"When you compose a romance, Nell dear, you may as well con- pose one that is likely to prove a reality at some not very distant future." "I am not to be rebuked or contradicted upon my birthday, Clyde, of all days in the year," Ellen said, and the' comical tone in which she spoke made the others laugh; and so the merry chit-chat went on, as it always did when these three were together. Later in the day - so late, in truth, that the brief November daylight was nearly over, and the fast- growing dusk of twilight made the dull gray sky seem closer, duller, grayer, darker than. ever-Nora Rey- nolds stood by the blazing grate in her parlor, talking to Ralph Bertrand. She was a bright, coquettish- looking, pretty little brunette; and her tall companion looked down upon her with something of the expres- 8  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7632-00000041"/> 86     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. sion in his face that a man generally puts on when looking at the gambols and listening to the prattle of a petted and indulged child. "Don't come for me too early, Ralph," Nora was saying. "I never care to-be ' the first at a feast,' and then one avoids being conspicuous by arriving with the crowd.? "A very modest reason; is it your only one?" "Is not one reason enough for a woman? Of course it is my only one, else why would I give it?" "I really cannot say; but you rather surprise me. I thought that you perhaps would like to go early, and introduce me to my cousins; you know I have not met them." Your cousins!"Nora repeated. You are dream- ing, Ralph; there is not the slightest vestige of rela- tionship between Clyde Wardleigh and yourself. She is only Mrs. Bertrand's niece." "And yet she is the one I am most anxious to meet." Nora's brown eyes flashed. "Whatever you do, Ralph, I will not have you fall in love with her." People say that she is wonderfully attractive." "As I know to my cost," the girl murmured, in such a low tone that the words were inaudible to her companion. She went on, louder, "People were right, Ralph; but I merely wished to warn you." "Do it effectually by letting our engagement be known, Nora. That would warn everybody off the premises, and certainly produce the desired effect."   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         87: "No!" she interrupted, almost angrily. "That is simply impossible." "As you will," he responded, carelessly enough. a Only I can't see why it is impossible, as you say." "You men never can see why." "If you wish the affair still kept secret, I am wholly indifferent. Only, if you wish to prevent Miss Ward- leigh's trying her powers of fascination upon me, your best security would be in letting the thing be known." "She will not try to please you. I must say that for her." "A further enigma! Women seldom care to lay siege to a preoccupied heart; and the knowledge that a man is engaged almost always prevents their think- ing of him. An engaged man is such a very harm- less creature that he is almost a nonentity in society. I am not far wrong, Nora, when I say that it is not likely Miss Wardleigh will give me more than a pass- ing thought." "You do not understand at all, Ralph." "Like all the rest of your sex, Nora, you are ut- terly incomprehensible. He would be the very wisest of mankind who could account for any woman's ac- 'tions, much less explain the motives actuating her." "It would be useless," Nora said, indifferently; "you could not do it. No man ever yet thoroughly understood a woman; and I doubt if I could, myself, give reasons for all my actions. But I have a very good reason for the warning and advice I give you to- day - not to fall in love with Clyde Wardleigh!"  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7632-00000042"/> 8     CCLYDE WARDLEIGH. "You cannot place much confidence in my love for you, Nora, if you consider such a warning necessary. Do you fear for me?" "Forewarned, forearmed,'; she said, with a look that he remembered later. "I shall be ready at ten o'clock, Ralph; be sure that you are punctual." CHAPTER VIII. ELLEN'S BIRTH-NIGHT BALL. While a thousand lustres shimmering stream In a palace's grand saloon. Flashing of jewels and flutter of laces, Tropical odors, sweeter than musk, And men and women with beautiful faces, And eyes of tropical dusk. AFTER THE BALL. ARE I come in, Miss Clyde?"Mina's voice in- quired, as Clyde was completing Ellen's toilet by placing the glowing crimson rose-wreath in her cousin's shining hair. "My! but yous does look fine," she went on, as she came up to the young ladies and handed Clyde a bouquet composed of white camelias and heliotrope, to which was attached Clarke Hender- son's card. ".I just knows already who will be the two prettiest young ladies in the room to-night-- you11 see once!" And Mina clasped her hands and drew a long breath of satisfaction.   CLYDE- WARDLEIGH.        89 "So you think I will do, Mnina?"Clyde said to their privileged attendant as Mina turned to her,-for Mina had lived so long in the family that her odd ways and queer speeches all passed as mere matters of course, - so you really think I will do? Yes; and now you must tell us what you think of Miss Ellen's dress." R"Miss Clyde, she's just as pretty as a picture," Mina said, smoothing down a stray fold in Clyde's white draperies; " and Miss Ellen- why, she's ever so fine!" "My dress is handsome," Ellen said, touching the heavy crimson silk, whose rich warmth of color was singularly becoming to her. "You are right, Mina; my dress is 'fine,' and Clyde's is 'pretty, but each suits its wearer." It would n't never suit me, such a dress,'i Mina remarked. "Why not, Mina?"Ellen asked. "Most people like to have and to wear pretty things; and so would you, I think." "Yes, I like the pretty things, too," Mina said; "but then, Miss Ellen, what suits you would n't never suit me." "How do you mean, Mina?" Mina put her arms akimbo and her head to one side. "First, Miss Ellen, I'd not have the durst, and I'd not care a hait to fix myself up like you do; it wouldn't be fittin' for me,"--she paused for a mo- 8*  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7632-00000043"/> 90     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. ment, --"'cause, you see, Miss Clyde, yous be ladies, and I - Clyde looked up, greatly amused. "Go on, Mina." "I 'm nothin' but a woman, Miss Clyde." "What else are we, Mina?" "Oh, Miss Ellen, does n't you just see? You are real righty ladies, and I never would be a lady, dress me never so fine with all Miss Ellen's silks and Miss Clyde's pretty sweet posies; for, you see, I'm only a Dutchie, come out of'the back streets, and Dutchies can't never be ladies, - they're only women!" and there was a twinkle of Mina's black eyes which told of sup- pressed amusement at her own queer notions. But this last speech was more than Ellen and Clyde could stand, and they both began to laugh - peals of clear, silvery laughter, in the midst of which there came a tremendous pull of the door-bell, and Mina hurriedly ran out of the room, exclaiming: "If there ain't somebody that wants me! If I did n't forget already that Mrs. Bertrand she said I should stop in the big front room to insist the ladies! Laws'ee me! s'posin' as how there was somebody there!" And Clyde and Ellen, at last controlling themselves, drew on their gloves and went down to the parlor, where Mrs. Bertrand, almost as handsome, in the calm matronly beauty of forty-five, as her daughter, stood ready to receive her guests. "Arrayed and ready for conquest!" was Clarke's mischievous greeting to the two girls as they turned   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        91 from Mrs. Bertrand's approving glance to meet him. "I am fairly at a loss for compliments or comparisons wherewith to do justice to the occasion! Moonlight and sunlight! May and July! a painter's fancy, a poet's dream! the very embodiment of my dream of fair women!' Clyde - Ellen, at whose shrine shall I bow?" "A truce to your nonsense, Clarke," was Ellen's gay reply. "I am sure I don't want your devotion, -the grapes not being at all sour, - and Clyde sha'n't have it. You are to play the devoted generally." "Which means, I suppose, that I am to dance with all the girls who have no partners, escort to supper and wait upon all the ancient and unattended females,- why will unattractive women persist in going to par- ties? see that everybody is introduced to everybody, and forget that I am anybody in my efforts to make myself useful." "Or, in other words," Clyde said, gently, "you must pay the penalty of our having no brothers, and- of your filling their empty place. People must pay sometimes for their privileges, Claike." He looked up. Ellen had turned to greet some of her coming guests, and they were alone. "I never forget that I am nbt your brother, Clyde." "I never had a brother," the girl said, quietly; but I always like to think of you in that position, Clarke. I sometimes forget that you are not really my brother, but only my friend." "You try very hard to make me content with  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7632-00000044"/> 92 .  CLYDE WARDLEIGH. friendship, Clyde," he began, nervously pulling at his glove. She interrupted him: "Look, Clarke, and tell me who that is with Nora Reynolds. If it be Ralph Bertrand, Ellen has every reason to be proud of her cousin." He followed the direction of Clyde's eye. "Yes," he said, "thatis Ralph Bertrand; though I must say I can't see why Ellen should be proud of him." "Only you men ndver' see one another as women see you," Clyde rejoined, smiling. "A pretty state of things that would be," Clarke grumbled, "if one's face and figure were the only letters of recommendation necessary."  "How do you know that I think him handsome?" Clyde asked. "Because I don't. Men and women seldom agree about such things." "Go and ask somebody to dance," Ellen said, com- ing up and relieving Clyde from what was rapidly becoming an unpleasant conversation. "After all, my rooms are well filled, in spite of the bad weather. Have you met my new cousin, Clyde? I will try to introduce him to you presently." She mingled again in the crowd, carrying Clarke wilth her; but he found time to say to Clyde: "I was cross and disagreeable, Clyde; forget it and forgive me." It would be a difficult, nay, almost an impossible thing to give a good and graphic description of a ball.   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         93 Here and there one may take little episodes of the evening and describe them, but nothing more. It is an ever-changing, ever-varying scene. One might give a receipt for it as follows: The first thing requi- site would be an ample supply of money. Then take, of men, so many, of women, so many; a large room, or, rather, rooms, well lighted; a handsome-supper- table well supplied with delicacies; a band of music, a number of flowers; by means of waltz, gallop, and quadrille mix these ingredients thoroughly for several hours, and your ball will be a complete success. That, at least, would be the framework and outline of the affair, which common-sense might pronounce nonsense; but to many of those who participate therein it is a dream of fairy-land, full of brilliancy and brightness, -the music is enchanting, and fairer flowers never bloomed. Life seems all gladness and sunshine, and the hours thus spent have a glamour over them, a fas- cination in them impossible to describe. But the gla- mour is all in the eyes of youth. Why can't that early enchantment last? Why does the brightness fade so speedily?  And Ellen Bertrand's birth-night ball proved no exception to the general rule. It was, like all other balls, an enjoyment to some, a disappointment to others; fairy land to some, to others purgatory. There were conversations and flirtations, bright speeches and silly sayings; in a word, a grand collection of the many trifles which go to fill up and make the sum total of an evening of fashionable enjoyment.  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7632-00000045"/> "     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. But to some the evening was full of sparkle and brilliancy. Nora Reynolds, for one, was very well aware of the fact that she was looking her very best in her bright dress of crimson crape spangled with gold, over silk, with diamonds sparkling like living flames at her ears, and scentless crimson camelias nest- ling in the rich braids of her dark-brown hair,--a style of dress which, in its warm brilliancy of color, would on any one else have looked fast and conspic- uous, but which on Nora Reynolds' small, graceful figure was as suitable and as easily worn as is the gay plumage of a bright tropical bird or our own cardinal --a part of itself. And so, perfectly well aware of her own appearance,--it is wonderful what an effect the ".onsciousness of being well and becomingly dressed has upon a woman's spirits and enjoyment, and there is not one of the sex insensible to it,-Nora Reynolds was probably as well satisfied with herself as was any of Mrs. Bertrand's guests. Before leaving home, she had renewed her warning to Ralph Bertrand concerning Clyde. It was, there- fore, somewhat surprising to the gentleman in question - though he had long since ceased to wonder at Miss Reynolds' doings--when she seized the first oppor-. tunity which presented to introduce him to Miss Wardleigh, with the playful remark, as the gentleman bowed and the lady acknowledged the introduction: "I foresee that you two will be great friends before long, and should not wonder if you did not immedi- ately claim a sort of kindred with each other."   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         95 And Clyde had smiled, as if Nora's remark had pleased her, and had replied that Ellen's cousin scarcely needed recommendation or introduction to her; and then she and Ralph Bertrand, as a necessary conse- quence of their new acquaintance, had joined the set of "Lancers" which was just forming; and, as a matter of course, there was no conversation worthy of the name between the two, always excepting the little disconnected remarks which everybody lnakes between the figures, and which are as stereotyped and conven- tional as is the invitation to dance, which invariably follows an introduction in' a ball-room. But Clyde was at a loss for even these little speeches; it seemed to her that she could think of nothing to say. Perhaps it was because the fact that Mr. Ber- trand was Ellrn's cousin was ever present to her, and, remembering this, she felt that the ceremonious polite- ness due from her to a stranger would be almost out of place with him; vand it was probably the wish to. be cordial and friendly which made her painfully con- scious that she had never appeared .to less advantage than she did in the eyes of her handsome partner; and she could only hope that he would not be influ- enced by first impressions. There was no doubt about his being handsome, as she had said to Clarke, or, to speak more correctly, distinguished-looking, tall, and well-formed, graceful, and yet it was a grace of man- liness and strength totally different from Clarke's almost feminine gracefulness. His wavy chestnut hair was pushed almost too carelessly from the broad brow;  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7632-00000046"/> 96     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. the deeply-set, dark-brown eyes looked you through and through; the heavy moustache shaded the firm - Clyde thought, almost obstinate--mouth, showing a very firm, decided temper, else the squarely-cut chin told a false tale, - a face which showed a strong and decided will, much self-reliance, -in a word, a manly man. And Clyde Wardleigh was not the only girl who thought Ralph Bertrand that evening the finest- looking man in the room. He himself had been somewhat bored, if the truth must be told, by his dance with Miss Wardleigh. He had previously heard much, not only from Nora, of her wonderful powers of attraction,- of the charm she was said to possess, -and he consequently felt some little anxiety to meet her. Nora's warning had slightly surprised him when it was spoken; he wondered to himself, now that he had met Clyde, that Nora should have considered it necessary; and he was wlholly unprepared for and astonished at the very anxious manner in which, on rejoining Miss Reynolds, she uttered the monosyllable "Well?" "A question in one word! What do you want to know?" "Clyde!" was all she said, with an eagerness he was not slow to perceive. "I have just danced with her." "I know that; but what do you think of her?" "Of Miss Wardleigh? I am rather surprised that you considered it necessary to warn me against her." "Really?"   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         97 "Really." "Then you were not particularly pleased?" "I see nothing remarkable in her," he said, quietly, all the time wondering to himself why it was that Nora bit her lip and flushed such a crimson; "her hair and complexion are pretty, and she has real violet eyes - a very rare thing, by the way - but beyond that -" he shrugged his shoulders. "Has she made no other impression upon you? Were you indeed afraid that she would win me from my allegiance to you, Nora?" he asked, lowering his voice so that she only heard the words. "I never for a moment would have suspected you of being jealous,--least of all, being jealous of Clyde Ward- leigh." "Jealous I and of Clyde!"Nora repeated, in a tone which she tried to render playful; lbut there was an effort in it which did not escape Ralph Bertrand's quick ear,--lawyers soon learn to notice every intona- tion of the voice,--but he misunderstood its cause, and hastened to reassure her.  "I do not think you need be jealous of her, Nora, as it is not likely that you will ever come into compe- tition with Miss Wardleigh. So far as I am con- cerned, your warning was thrown away." "What do you think of Ellen?" was Nora's rather irrelevant reply to this remark. "My cousin?  She is extremely handsome--some- thing in your style, Nora, though on a larger scale. Haynes has been playing the devoted all the evening." 9         G  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7632-00000047"/> 98     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. "Opposites meet," Nora said, carelessly. "Ie is fair, she is dark; that may explain his very evident admiration." And then the soft, plaintive, lovely notes of the "Mabel Waltzes " floated through and filled the room, and Nora joined the dancers with Clarke, Mr. Ber- trand not indulging in the delightful motion of the waltz. So the evening sped on -too fleetly for some, lin- geringly and on lagging feet for others. But as all things - be they pleasant or painful, joyous or sad - must some time have an ending, so at last Ellen Ber- trand's birth-night ball was over,the last lingerer de- parted, and Ellen and Clyde, girl-like, sat over the fire discussing the events of the evening. "I believe that, after all, this is the pleasantest part of the whole thing," Ellen said, as she donned her scarlet wrapper and loosened her hair from the elaborate- braids in which it had been arranged. "There is nothing I enjoy more than talking over a party." "Except remembering the compliments paid you,' Clyde said, mischievously.  "It depends very much upon who pays them," Ellen laughed. "By the way, were you introduced to * my new cousin? I had no opportunity for doing it all evening." "I was-and to his partner, who, unless I am very much mistaken, played the devoted to Miss Bertrand all evening."   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        99 "I wonder how many 'played the devoted' to Miss Wardleigh all evening." "You predicted I would meet my fate, Nell; but how is it about yourself? Does Mr. Haynes or Mr. Bertrand, either of them, realize your ideal? You are not romantic or sentimental, but you must have some opinion about them. I am, of course, out of the question." "My dear Clyde, how very modest you are! I consider you decidedly in the question!" She came and knelt at her cousin's feet, looking up into Clyde's face. "Clyde, will you never weary of admiration, and bind yourself to one?" It was asked seriously. A slight shade came over her brow. She did not blush, as most girls would have done at such a ques- tion. Clyde was not given to blushing on all oc- casions. "'You are delightfully absurd, Nell! Once for all, please understand that I never expect to marry: that career or destiny is left for you. And what do you think Aunt Margaret and Uncle Bertrand would say to both their daughters leaving them? As for admi- ration, that is not the only thing necessary; sweet- meats and bonbons are very nice in their way, but would prove a very unsubstantial diet and unwhole- some daily fare. And I am not at all disturbed by the thought that Wardleigh may be inscribed upon my tombstone." "You make me shiver, Clyde. Wait, and we will see!"  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7632-00000048"/> 100     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. She answered, seriously, "Yes, Ellen, we shall see. Mark my words, though I see you do not believe me, I never shall marry. My life -" She paused. Her tone had lost its joyouis playfulness, and a sudden paleness came over her face. Ellen spoke hurriedly: "Clyde, have you any fears about your health?  She interrupted her with a careless laugh. "Imag- inative, as ever, Nell! No, dear, I hope and expect to live to be an old woman. Look forward thirty years; what old women we shall be then! And what a nice, kind old auntie I mean some day to be to your children, Nell dear! I'll claim thati relationship in- stead of cousin." "Provided Mr. Right does not come along some of these fine days to interfere with your plans, Clyde. And poor Clarke; have you no thought for him?" "Nell, the clock is striking -one - two-three four! Good-night!" CHAPTER IX. NORA. For if she will, she will, you may. depend on't; And if she won't, she won't; so there's an end on 't. ETHAN BERTRAND'S birth-night ball had been a decided success. So everybody said, and even Nora Reynolds acknowledged it, very unwillingly   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         101 too, all the time saying to herself that she really could not understand why Ellen Bertrand should celebrate her coming of age, just as a man would. It was the most absurd thing she had ever heard of. Absurd or not, the success of the evening was a fixed fact, and Nora knew it. And Nora knew perfectly well, be- sides, that it would serve as a standard by which all the other parties of the winter would be judged. She thoroughly understood that in point of wealth and display she could not compete with the Bertrands- few in the city could -although, after all, it was scarcely display; for the luxuries surrounding them seemed and were taken as mere matters of course; but she was dissatisfied. She had always been a sort of leader in her own set, and Nora did not fancy being eclipsed, though but for a short time. And so, a few mornings after Ellen's party, she sat in her own room engaged in profound thought. It was profound thought for Nora Reynolds, and yet it was upon a subject scarce worthy, after all,' of the amount of plotting and planning her busy brain was lavishing upon it. She wanted to contrive something which would create a sensation--make people forget Miss Bertrand's ball, andi take its pJace as the event of the winter. That ball had disappointed her. She had enjoyed it, to be sure, for she was passionately fond of dancing; but then things 8had not shaped themselves exactly as she had wished. Strange as it may seem, she was dis- appointed that Ralphl Bertrand should have seemed so very indifferent to, so little influenced by, Clyde 9*  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7632-00000049"/> 102     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. Wardleigh's attractions.' Most engaged young ladies would have been better pleased with this state of the case. Then Clarke Henderson, her own cousin, uni- versally acknowledged the best dancer in their set, had only danced with her once, while he had sought out Clyde at every opportunity; and although Nora would have been very willing to see Mr. Bertrand and Miss Wardleigh together, she objected most seriously to Clarke's devotion to her old schoolmate. Even in those old school-days Nora had been con- scious of a sort of jealousy of Clyde in spite of their apparent intimacy. Praise bestowed on Clyde had always seemed to Nora something taken from herself; and now, little as Clyde suspected it, she had no more bitter enemy, though in secret, than Nora Reynolds. Clyde would have been greatly surprised-in fact, would not have believed it-had any one told her this; but it was not the less true. Its cause was sim- ply this: that Clarke Henderson's heart was wholly and had long been given to Clyde, and he was totally unconscious that. Nora Reynolds would have given worlds to have held the place in his affections which seemed so valueless to Clyde, who yet gave him a truly sisterly love and friendship. That it was 'only a sister's love, a sister's friendship, Clarke either could not or would not see; at the very bottom of his heart there lingered an earnest hope that his long devotion, his sincere love for Clyde, might some day win its own reward. He would never despair until the girl he loved was the wife of another. Nora saw and under-   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         103 stood this. Living as she did under the same roof, she read and understood Clarke's feelings as only a woman can.; she saw that Clarke, looking upon her as a sister, and as such giving her his entire confi- dence, never for one moment suspected that she loved him. Nora concealed it carefully; she feared lest Clarke, discovering it, would leave the house, and withdraw from her, as in honor bound, the friendship and frank brotherly intercourse which she now prized as a means to the end she had in view. It may be asked why, loving Clarke Henderson as intensely as her thoroughly selfish nature permitted, for SELF was the moving-spring of all her actions, and in everything she did she asked herself what benefit she would reap from it, - it may be asked why Nora Rey- nolds had pledged herself, in secret though it was, to Ralph Bertrand. She was passionately fond of admira- tion, caring little whence, it came; it was daily bread and vital breath to her. She had been engaged over and over again, and the knowledge that she was generally considered a flirt did not in the least degree distress her or disturb her peace of mind. How she had at- tracted Bertrand it would be hard to say, were it not that, chameleon-like, she could be "all things to all men." Hle was so very different from her other ad- mirers; there was more true manliness in him, more stability of character, than Nora, with her quick in- sight, had generally found in the butterflies of fashion who fluttered around her, attracted by her sweet smiles, honeyed words, and her father's known wealth; and  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7632-00000050"/> 104     CLYDE WARDLEIGII. she was proud of her conquest, or, rather, had been proud. She had never felt anything like love for him, and her present plan was to interest him in Clyde, so that, if she chose, she might have a fair excuse for a rupture of her engagement, and at the same time be left at liberty to carry out unobserved her designs upon Clarke Henderson's heart. But, all this was kept to herself. Her best play was to make Bertrand think her unwilling to have him thrown into contact with Miss Wardleigh. She knew enough of men to be well aware of the fact that most of them were sure to long after forbidden fruit. She determined to bring Clyde and Bertrand together, so far as lay in her power, an easy thing to do- for she and Ellen and Clyde had always been intimate- and yet all the time to contrive to make Ralph Bertrand think she was averse to his being thrown into contact with her attractive friend. For Clyde was attractive, even Nora acknowledged that; more so, perhaps, that she was unconscious of it, that her manner never varied, in public or in pri- vate, from its usual gentle composure. Nora saw and felt, like others, its charm, and wondered in what it lay. She knew that Clyde was neither smart nor bril- liant, in the common acceptance of those often used words; there was neither "dash " nor "fastness" about her, not even the gay vivacity characterizing hei' own manner. It was only a certain quiet dignity, a gentle womanliness, a calm repose, which Nora had tried in vain to imitate and make her own. And then Clyde   CLYDE WARDLEIG H.        105 was no talkative wooman. She was not apt, nor did she even attempt the quick lively repartee and bright little speeches on which Nora rather prided herself; and yet Nora well knew that Clyde's low soft voice lent a charm to her slightest word which her own hap- piest sayings could never possess. But with all this, Nora's latent jealousy of Clyde would never have wakened into active life had not Clarke Henderson enrolled himself among her admirers. If this fact had once annoyed Nora, it had done so a thousand times; for she wished to be first in every place and with every one. She had hitherto been successful in concealing that in her own estimation she was always the person of the most importance, and she was, in consequence, popular, --more so, indeed, than either Clyde or Ellen, though that was partly owing to the fact of their finding their own home so pleasant and attractive that they were satis- fied with its enjoyments, and while entering into and. taking pleasure in society, they yet made it a secon- dary consideration, while with Nora it was the chief aim and object of life. 'And so, despite her professed friendship for Ellen - which was, indeed, a sort of real yet negative friend- ship, based upon the fact that Ellen never interfered with her or frustrated, even unconsciously, as Clyde was doing, any of her 'plans - Nora could not bear to think that Ellen or any one, even in so trifling a mat- ter as the giving of a party, could eclipse her. That was why, on this bright November morning, Nora sat  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7632-00000051"/> 106     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. engrossed in the train of thought sketched in the pre- ceding pages. She knew well enough that in carrying out her plans, whatever they might be, she must de- pend upon Clarke for assistance, and she anxiously awaited his coming home to the late dinner which their living at a distance from the business part of the city rendered necessary. Clarke was, nominally, a lawyer, though, as he said, and with truth, he only kept an office for the name of the thing; and his book- case, instead of being stocked with erudite legal works such as Blackstone, Coke upon Lyttleton, The Fed- eralist, etc., was filled with lighter publications, and his table, instead of being strewed with briefs, affida- vits, and other law-papers and accounts, was generally heaped with magazines and reviews, with here and there an uncorrected "proof," and returned or unfin- ishcd "copy;" for Clarke had joined the great army of writers who are so innumerable at the present day. He wrote for the very love of the tiling; it was no labor, but rather a relaxation. In his own particular line he had been quite successful, and his signature, E. C. Karl- an anagram of his own name -was familiar to the readers of several magazines. And Nora waited quietly and patiently for him to come home ini order to consult with him as to her contem- plated entertainment. One element of success Nora possessed: she knew how to wait, a quality denied to most womlen, for the sex are generally impatient. And, having waited, she knew- for selfishness makes us wonderfully clear- -          I t!  -  -  1,   CLYDE WARDLEIGI.        107 sighted concerning our own interests--when to seize upon the momentlfavorable to success. And so, when - Clarke came home, she did not speak at once; she waited- waited until the dinner was over and dessert removed. She' knew that men, even the best and most amiable of them, are-generally more manageable and obliging after than before dinner. Then, when Clarke came into the library, she had hi'slippers and meerschaum all ready for him, and she herself occu- pied an easy-chair near the grate. As he filled his pipe, Nora looked up eagerly with- out speaking. Clarke saw the glance, and laughed. "What is it that you want, Nora? Out with it at once.) "Who told you I wanted anything?" "Only my own clear-sightedness.  Come, what is it?" "Nothing of any impdrtanc I have some idea of giving a party." ' "Is that all? Seems to me a very easy thing to do. Sautter or Augustine will take all the responsi- bility off your hands. Shall I leave your orders to- morrow? I suppose that is all you want with me." "Thank you; no. Anybody can get up that sort of an entertainment. I want something new, startling, and original." "Originality is played out nowadays, Nora. You had better be satisfied with taking things as they are." "Which is exactly what I don't want to do!" pout- ingly. 'Come, Clarke, like a dear good cousin, as  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7632-00000052"/> 108     CLYDE WARDLEIGI. you are, stop making a smoke-producing machine of yourself, and give me a suggestion. You know I would rather trust to your judgment than to that of any one else." "Nothing like a little flattery, you think, Nora?" he laughed.  Well, there are tableaux-charades." "Both hackneyed and worn out." "A parlor-concert." "None of our set are sufficiently musical to warrant success." "Try a masquerade." "Thank you; no.  They sometimes result disa- greeably." Clarke put on a comical expression of despair, and surrounded himself with clouds of smoke. Out of them came at last an idea. "I have it, Nora! Get up some private theat- ricals." That might do for want of something better. Sup- pose we talk it over." They did talk it over, and to some purpose, for the more they discussed the plan the better they liked it; and before Clarke went out that evening, they had settled the whole thing, even to selecting the play and choosing the persons who were to perform in it. The play was to be "The Lady of Lyons," and Clarke had promised Nora that he would curtail it and adapt it, so far as he could, to private representa- tion. Nora intended assigning to each person the part she desired them to assume. It would, as she said to   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        109 Clarke, save trouble; for otherwise every one would want to be first, and nobody would' be content with secondary parts. And if they were left to decide the thing among themselves, there would be an endless confusion; while if each one was requested as a favor to assume a certain part, there could be no difficulty. And the event proved that Nora was right. "Of course I am to play Claude, and you Pauline," Clarke had said to her. "Of course not. The only part I expect to assume is that of hostess. The characters you mention I shall reserve for Clyde and Mr. Bertrand." And what for me?" "Like myself, you are at home. I will constitute you prompter and master of ceremonies." "Thereby depriving me of all chance of distinguish- ing myself. Nora, you are unkind." "Very," she laughed, "when I know how fond you are of study. And I really think Mr. Bertrand will make a better Claude than you would." "How will you like seeing him  make love to Clyde?" ' As if I cared who Ralph Bertrand made love to!" Nora replied, with feigned disdain. "\What! sincerely and seriously, Nora? I must say, were I engaged to a young lady, I should object to seeing any other man make love to her, though only in fun." "Ah, but then I am not engaged to the gentleman in question! That alters the case. He has my full, 10  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7632-00000053"/> "O     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. unqualified permission to play the devoted to any one he may choose." "Are you really in earnest?" Never more so, I assure you." She told the false- hood unhesitatingly and without a change of counte- nance. "I am bound to believe you, Nora, though young ladies generally consider themselves privileged to 'fib' -that's the word, isn't it-on these subjects; but I scarcely think-I would not like to think-you would tell me anything but the truth." "And you do me no more than justice there, Clarke." It. was no part of Nora's plan that her engagement should be known. She would hesitate at nothing, let it be what it might, which could in the least degree assist her in the attainment of her object, and all means were lawful, provided they led to the desired result. So Nora told her " fib" without one moment's hesita- tion, and would have told a thousand more if by so doing she could have gained anything. And yet, strange to say, she would not have had Clarke think her anything but the soul of truth. She valued his good opinion as she valued that of no hu- man being, not even of her parents, and she had always been careful to show him only the best side of her character. For Nora Reynolds was' a thorough ac- tress, as indeed most women are. Here and there may be found some noble exceptions to the rule; but take them as a whole, and the sex are adepts at con- cealment and deceiving one into thinking them better *   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         Ill than they really are. And Nora Reynolds possessed to perfection the art of making people believe her what she appeared to be, the gift of making the worse appear the better reason. CHAPTER X.

The speaker was Clyde Wardleigh; the person ad- dressed was Ralph Bertrand; the scene was Nora Reynolds' parlor; for by this time Nora's projected theatricals promised to be a decided success., Clarke had abridged and rewritten the play, so that, without omitting any of its beauties or interfering with any of its dramatic situations, he had yet brought it to a form and length, more suitable for private representation. Nora had herself apportioned the characters; her own tact had told her, as she had said to Clarke, that in her own house the part of hostess was the only one suited to her. She had brought her parity together, and had actually succeeded, marvellous to relate, in making every one feel satisfied with the part assigned them in the play.  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7632-00000054"/> "2     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. Except Clyde. She had tried hard -at least as far as she could without being disobliging-to avoid taking part in the play. She told Nora, most truthfully, that she would greatly prefer the position of spectator to that of actor; she made every excuse she could think of, but all in vain. Nora had made up her mind that Clyde should act, and Clyde soon found that there was nothing left for her but to yield the point as grace- fully as possible, and to submit to be obliging. Nora would take no' denial. Mrs. Bertrand had seconded her entreaties; and so Clyde had tried to forget her own unwillingness, and had consented, and, finding that she had no choice in the matter, had finally be- come more interested than she had at first deemed pos- sible. Ellen had at once refused, and as Nora was wholly indifferent about her taking part or not, she had not been urged to reconsider her refusal, beyond the usual formal expressions of regret. Nothing in the world brings people into more lthor- ough or closer acquaintance with one another than the rehearsals for private theatricals or for tableaux. Com- pared with them, the old test of travelling together sinks' into utter insignificance for travelling nowa- days can be made as comfortable, some think, as stay- ing at home.

A play of this kind generally affords more real amusement to the persons concerned in it than the most laughable and mirth-inspiring comedy or farce. And the pres- ent occasion proved no exception to the rule. As usual, the first reJlearsal came, and not one of the la- dies or gentlemen interested knew one word of their parts. Clarke, who was to act as manager, prompter, conductor, as well as performer, scolded in vain; the merry party only laughed and jested, and promised to do better next time. But next time and next time came, and Nora began to think that after all she had accomiplished nothing except the affording her friends a few evenings' amusement. - They would meet punc-e tually enough, but evidently with very faint ideas as to what was requlied of them. Presently, however, a few speeches here and there were committed to mem- ory, the apparently vague ideas began to assume form and shape, and in the course of a few weeks Nora began to think that at last there was some chance of her being able to carry out her original plan, and cel- ebrate Twelfth Night by her combined theatrical- en- 10 *        H  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7632-00000055"/> "4     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. tertainment and ball. It was at one of the rehearsals that the words were spoken with which this chapter begins.  You are scarcely my idea of what Melnotte should be!" Ralph Bertrand smiled. "I consider that quite a compliment, Miss Wardleigh, though few would take it as such." "And yet I meant it in that way," Clyde said. "I began to fear the moment I spoke that you might think me rude, but there was nothing further from my thoughts." And, fortunately, I never had any admiration for Claude. He is too much the stage-hero, overdrawn and impossible, and yet too weak and too easily influ- enced by' others to be worthy of being a hero. His remorse, when it comes, comes too late." "Will youexcuse me if I say that the part does not suit you, Mr. Bertrand? I cannot identify you with it. You are never Claude, but always yourself." ' It would haVe suited your friend, Mr. Henderson, better," Bertrand laughed. "If I had been permitted to choose my part, I should have selected bluff Colonel Damas, notwithstanding your fair personation of Pau- line. It is genuine acting on my part, for I cannot throw myself, as you say, into Claude. I never did and never will believe that 'all's fair in love,' which, after all, is the true moral of the piece. * I should never value anything won solely by stratagem. Fair means or none." /   CLYDE WARDLEIGII.       -l.) "Yet Melnotte thought it fair,' Clyde said, "and Pauline forgives him at -the last." "On the stage, yes; in real jifc, never. Once de- ceived, it seems to me there never could be trust or faith again. And Melnotte is no true man; he is but a puppet in the hands of others. He never asserts his own individuality until the moment in which we lose sight of him." "' No one would ever doubt your individuality even for a moment," Clyde said, "or ever think that you would submit to be guided by others. That is the point in which you differ from Claude; and I imagine you will consider it a very poor compliment if, after all this, you are told by any one that your part just suited you." "It would depend very much uponi the speaker," Ralph Bertrand said. ." I might consider it a compli- ment to my acting. You look your part, Miss Ward- leigh; but do you admire Pauline as profoundly as. I admire Claude?" CI should have a p1ufound admiration for myself if I only could succeed in learning Pauline's numerous speeches," was Clyde's gay reply. "I study my part without learning it, and learn the others' parts without studying them, and expect, when Twelfth Night comes, that I shall know the whole play by heart, with the exception of the words I am to speak myself." "Shall we exchange our parts?" he asked, mis- chievously. "It would be a new reading and ren- dering, no doubt, and you know novelty is always  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7632-00000056"/> "6     CLYDE WARDLEIGIU.  attractive. Or perhaps you' would prefer a different Claude. If so, I will resign in his favor." i No," Clyde said; "I prefer that you should retain your part." "Even in preference to Henderson?" "I should only think of him as himself, just as I always remember that you are Mr. Bertrand. After all, what a perfect farce it is for amateurs to undertake these things; and they always expect to be told that their acting is equal to any on the stage." "I rather enjoy the meetings," Mr. Bertrand said., They,are decidedly amusing." "They would, be decidedly more amusing," Clarke said, coming up just in time to hear this last observa- tion,' if you good people would only learn your parts. I will except you, Clyde, for you nearly know yours. Come, you are wanted, both of you; we are nearly ready for the grand 'Lake of Como' scene. Bertrand, I expect you to make love as if you were really in earnest. Clyde, listen as gracefully as you can. Of course you have practised attitude and expression be- fore the glass until you are perfect in both, and have studied till you can 'suit the action to the word and the word to the action.' Come, Clyde, your cue will be spoken in a minute -' it would be so ill-bred to be prudish.' Quick, say prunes, prunellas, and prisms, so as to give your mouth the proper expression, and go to your place." And Clyde laughingly obeyed him.  The party was to meet the following evening at the Bertrands   CLYDE WARDLETCII.        117 for the purpose of going to the "Walnut," where the "Lady of Lyons" was to be performed. As Nora said, it was a piece of great good luck, and just exactly what they all wanted -a good lesson in acting, be- cause one of our best American actors, who has made the part his own, was now in the city, and this was one of the plays on the list which, weeks before, he had sent to the manager. But the party were only too glad of the opportunity thus presented for them to learn from professional actors something about the true way in which to perform their respective parts. Nora's invitations were already out - this being, Mon- day, and Twelfth Night came on Thursday- and the performers had informed their friends that none of them should even think of going to the theatre on Tuesday evening, as, although they had no intention of attempting to compete with professionals, they yet believed firmly in the truth of the old saying, "Com- parisons are odious," and they wished none to be drawn. On Wednesday they were to meet for a full-dress re- hearsal, and on the following evening the performance was to come off. So, when the party separated on Monday evening, Nora bade them good-night with the very comfortable feeling that everything was going on just exactly as she desired. But when they met at Mrs. Bertrand's, to go thence to the theatre, she was greatly annoyed at finding that Clarke had offered his services to Clyde as escort, when she had fully determined to secure him for herself, and she, in consequence, was left to Ralph Bertrand.  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7632-00000057"/> "8     CLYDE WA RDLEIGH. Had Nora consulted her own inclinations, she would have pleaded a sudden and violent headache as an excuse for going home; but her pride reminded her, jtst in time, that she had been the prime mover in thee enterprise: she herself had suggested going to the the- atre; she had said, that, although she was only a spec- tator, she yet intended witnessing the performance, so that she might be able to relieve her friends of all responsibility in providing and arranging everything that could possibly be necessary; she had laughingly claimed that her position as hostess privileged her to accompany the party,--and remembering all this, she knew that go she must. Disappointed though she felt, she knew that there was nothing left for her ex- cept to be as amiable as possible; and consequently, Nora Reynolds put aside for the time her annoyance, and was, as usual, the life and presiding spirit of the party. She could not, however, resist the temptation of asking Clyde what she thought of Mr. Bertrand. Clyde only smiled; she seldom expressed an opinion of any one. "A very sweet smile, Clyde; but, really, what do you think of Nell's cousin?"Nora persisted. "Iy dear Nora, I can scarcely say I know him." "But you must by this time have formed some idea as to him, Clyde. It is very evident that Nell has not thought it too soon to form a most favorable opinion of Mr. Haynes, and he is very much pleased with her; and, my dear, you have had exactly the same oppor- tunity and the same time in which to come to some conclusion about Mr. Bertrand. He admires you."   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        119 "Report says that he admires you, Nora." Reports are very unreliable things, Clyde. I am sorry that such a silly story should have crept into circulation. He makes a handsome Claude, don't he?" Yes." "And you like him, don't you?" seemingly careless. "You seem very much interested in that, Nora," Clyde said, laughing. "It is not a matter of great importance, to be sure, -you are the only person, ex- cept Ellen, who has seemed to give it a thought, but if it is really a matter of consequence to you, I am very willing to tell you my real conclusion. It is this,-that if ever I know Mr. Bertrand well enough to have an opinion about him, I shall either like or dislike him." It was said so playfully that no offence could pos- sibly be taken. Nora shook her fingers playfully at her friend. You are fearfully non-committal, Clyde; and yet, who knows but that it may, in the long run, prove the best policy." "Policy!"Clyde repeated. "Don't accuse me of that, Nora: of all things in the world, I have a per- fect horror of what is called ' good policy.' To me it means everything that is base, artful, and designing. I hope and trust I may never be accused of those faults; whatever others I may have." "You cannot, Clyde;" and Nora spoke but truth. "I only wis 1l were like you in that; but--" and for a moment, as happens to all of us at times, Nora  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7632-00000058"/> i20     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. was her best self, " but I fear that all, or nearly all, my actions are prompted by that selfish motive-policy." "Nora, you are trying to give yourself the very worst character you possibly can." "Am I?  Well, Clyde, forget, if you possibly can, that it is true, or else think that I am only talking for talk's sake, or to hear what you will say, as girls will do." "What are you young ladies discussing so earnest- ly?"Mr. Bertrand asked, as he and Clarke came up to them. "It is something very interesting, no doubt, and it is a very great pity to interrupt you; but if you want to be at the theatre early, we had better start at once." "I second that motion," Clarke said. "It would be a pity, under the circumstances, for us to lose a word of the play; and so, if we really wish to profit by the lesson awaiting us, we had better start at once. And to-morrow evening shall prove which of our party has used eyes and ears to the best advantage." He handed the girls, as he?poke, the shawls and wraps Mina had brought; and a few moments later the party had started for the theatre. "I just wonder where Miss Clyde's eyes and ears can be?"Mina said to herself, as she went down- stairs. "I just seen how Miss Nora looked at her when she went off with Mr. Henderson. But, laws 'ee me, Miss Clyde she's too good; she don't stop to think harm of no one, least of all of Miss Nora. And Miss Nora she's just like a cat; she ain't no friend -?'            -    CLYDE' WARDLEIGH.        121 of Miss Clyde's. She's just so deceitful, anybody can see she don't like my young ladies any more. I haven't the dare to say so to them, nohow; I just wish I could once. Miss Nora, Miss Nora, you can't never hold a candle to my young ladies; but you think yourself ever so much nicer than they be, and yet you'd like mightily to get them outen your road." Mina was right.  Had Nora Reynolds' dearest friend stood in her way, she would have hesitated at nothing which could possibly be-done in order to set her aside, would have trampled carelessly upon their tenderest feelings. So long as her own point was gained,'it mattered not at what cost to others. She was intensely selfish. In that word her whole charac- ter may be epitomized. CHAPTER XI. A SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE, I would, if I could; If I couldn't, how could I? THE evening at the theatre was over; the last re- hearsal, in full dress, so that the performers might feel at home and at ease in their costumes, had taken place; and, strange to say, the evening of the long expected, much talked-of performance came, and each one was perfect in the words of his or her parts. Con- "  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7632-00000059"/> 122     CLYDE  WARD-LEIGE. sequently they had separated on Wednesday evening, very well satisfied with themselves, for their visit to the Walnut had taught them more of stage business and situations than they could have learned in a dozen or more private rehearsals, and Clarke expressed him- self satisfied with the result. And Nora Reynolds had spared neither time, trou- ble) nor expense in her efforts to make her projected entertainment a success. The house was well adapted -for private theatricals, and that had first suggested the idea to Clarke. The library was separated from the drawing-room by an arch, from which hung heavy ,crimson curtains, which could be at pleasure drawn back, throwing the two rooms into one. Just beyond this arch, whose draperies formed the curtain so indis- pensable in dramatic representation, a temporary stage had been erected, with scenery, foot-lights, and en- trances; and, to secure the effect which in ordinary theatres is produced by the distance between the actors ,and the audience, the arch between the two rooms was fitted with the thinnest, most transparent rose-colored gauze, so fine and sheer that it was almost impercep- tible, but which aided wonderfully in producing the desired effect. Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds, ever ready and willing to indulge their daughter, had left every- thing to her to arrange as she chose , and when every- thing was complete, and Nora, dressed for the evening, -came down to take a last look with Clarke, before her guests arrived, at the preparations for the entertain- ment, so-as to be sure that nothing had been omitted   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        123 or forgotten, they both agreed that everything was as complete as they could possibly make it. Even pro- grammes, carefully printed for the occasion on super- fine note-paper, were ready to be handed to each guest on his arrival. Nora felt very sure that she had succeeded in pro- ducing a sensation. Expectation had been raised to the very highest point. Miss Reynolds' Twelfth Night entertainment and ball had been the subject of conversation in fashionable circles for weeks past; and Nora had gained one point, - she had made people forget Ellen Bertrand's birthnight ball, and talk of the pleasure which she had in store for them in its place. She had not the slightest doubt but that it would prove a pleasure; and feeling, as she did, that she had neglected nothing which depended upon her to ensure success, it was in a very contented mood that she walked up and down the long and brilliantly lighted drawing-room, waiting for her guests to arrive. Two things added greatly to Nora's content. First, Clarke was with her, for she had insisted that "Claude" should attend "Pauline"; and, although he was dressed for his part, the rather thankless one of "Beauseant," which after all he had -to take, and threatened to disappear the moment any one came; for, while the performers expected to mingle with the audience in costume after the play was over, they yet desired to remain unseen until the proper momentshould arrive for their appearance upon the stage, -he was willing enough now to be with Nora; and it gratified             "  /       "  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7632-00000060"/> 124     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. her exceedingly that she was able to keep him, even for these few moments of waiting, by her side, solely' engrossed in and attentive to her. Second, she was very well aware of the fact that her careful attention to her toilette that evening had resulted -though she was simply dressed, for Nora had too much tact to appear so as to outshine any of her guests - in look- ing her very best; and no woman ever is indifferent to that fact, or fails to enjoy the knowledge of it, or else to feel that, trifling though men may think it, it is an essential item in her pleasure. And the sweet harmonies of color, the pleasant sense of beauty and fitness in form and shape, were *ue delights to Nora.  So, on this bright January evening,--for even the weather was favorable, the full radiant moon shining with a lustre unsurpassed even by the bright- est midsummer's moonlight on the snow-covered ground,--so Nora was well content. Only one thought , came which in any way was a drawhack, -it was the thought that possibly, in spite of all she had done, Pauline, the heroine of the play, might also be the heroine of the evening. It was not a pleasant thought, it came unbidden; and Nora put it promptly aside, thinking that, had Clyde possessed the charm of nov- elty, she might have reason to fear her; but, as it was on this especial evening, she did not dread coln- parison. She felt too sure of her own position. Clarke was pledged to her for the evening, Claude to Pauline. Content with that for the present, she thought it held the promise of eventual success.   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        125 Punctually with the stroke of nine the perform- ance was to begin. Nora's invitations stated that Miss Reynolds would be "at home" at half-past eight; and with that hour the guests began to arrive. Nora played the hostess to perfection. She possessed the power so rare among American women, so common among our French sisters, of entertaining well; and, although she longed at the bottom of her heart to be in the reception-room, which opened into the library, and to which Clarke had long since escaped to join the merry party of performers there assembled, she yet had to remain at her post and receive her guests. Not one could complain of neglect at her hands; each one was cordially greeted and conducted to his or her appointed place; and not till the room was filled, the last comer seated, and the notes of the overture played by the musicians-- who were later to provide inspira- tion for those who loved dancing-were filling the room, - not till then, when Nora knew that all eyes were riveted upon the crimson curtain so soon to rise, and that in the eager expectation of what it promised she was forgotten,- not till then did Nora feel at lib- erty to consult her own inclinations, and go for a moment to join her friends behind the scenes. "I almost wish I were one of you, you seem to be having such a good time," she said, as the merry party gathered around her. "I have played my part, And am a very unimportant personage just now. How well you all do look, and the best of it is that your stage-dresses have completely changed you. Percy- "*  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7632-00000061"/> 126     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. Lille, I never should have known you! -as Lille Lewis, a tall, graceful blonde, in the cap, kerchief, and modest peasant dress of 'Widow Melnotte, and her brother Percy in the gray wig, black velvet suit, and lace ruffles of M. Deschappelles, came forward and greeted her with mock ceremony. "I think that you have every reason so far to be satisfied, Nora," Clyde said to her. "Only I am tor- mented with a terrible dread of stage fright, and, what is equally formidable, of forgetting my part." Imagine the audience to be so many dolls, Miss Wardleigh," Robert Haynes said to her. He was to play Colonel Damas, and his fine military bearing made him look the part thoroughly; for Robert Haynes had seen service, and the well-preserved uni- form he wore was that of no mere carpet-knight, in name only a soldier, but he had been among the very first to come forward to defend his country in her hour of sore need; and should she ever again, God forbid a similar necessity! should she ever again call upon her gallant sons to rally around her banner, his arm would not be the last ready to strike, his sword not the last to be unsheathed in her defence. ( That is what I intend to do, if I can." "There must be no 'ifs,' Mr. Haynes," --he had dropped the 'Major' on returning to civil life,-- Nora said. "Like Nelson, I to-night expect every man to do his duty." And before the peal of laughter which greeted Miss Reynolds' mock-heroic delivery of this famous speech-which, by the way, somte say   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         127 never was made by the great admiral- had subsided, Clarke called upon the actors engaged in the first scene to come and take their places for it, as the last notes of the overture were sounding; and then the tinkle of a little bell was heard, the curtains were drawn aside, and the play began. "Is applause to be permitted, Miss Reynolds?" was a question which Nora had grown almost tired of answering in the affirmative, as well as of saying that it would of course be pleasant for the performers to know that their efforts to amuse were appreciated. Consequently, the withdrawal of the curtains was greeted. with a round of applause; and the same token of approbation was not infrequent during the play. Nor was it undeserved. Those who take part in private theatricals--and in them it is a well- known fact, that, if on the performers falls all the labor, they yet monopolize the lion's share of the enjoy- ment- are generally very apt to think, no matter how evident the contrary may be to others, that their acting is, to say the least, first-rate. However, as none of us are ever willing to acknowledge that we have failed in anything we choose to undertake, perhaps amateur actors are excusable. In this case the acting really was good, though, as Mr. Haynes said, it would be strange, if a party of educated men and women, fully understanding what was required of them, and famil- iar, to a certain extent, with the theatre, or at least accustomed occasionally to going to see a good play, it would have been strange if they should have failed  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7632-00000062"/> 128     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. in giving at least a passable representation of a drama as well known to most play-goers as the one they had selected. It was over: not a single thing had occurred to mar the smoothness of the representation; everything had been so well arranged that, there had not been even a moment's hesitation, not an instant's delay in any of the necessary business of the scene. Clarke had drilled the party well; and they had been rewarded for their ready obedience to him by one of the most successful performances ever given in private. Nora was de- lighted; the play had gone off better than her most sanguine wishes had allowed her to hope; and as the main feature of the evening had proved everything she could possibly-have desired, she had no fears for the rest. A short time was allowed for the guests to con- gratulate the ladies and gentlemen who had labored so successfully for their amusement; and then, having provided music for those who loved dancing, conversa- tion for those who preferred conversation, and cards for those who enjoyed a quiet game of whist or euchre, Nora felt at liberty to amuse herself as she chose. Her first impulse, promptly obeyed, was to join Clyde, around whom the merry crowd of actors had collected, and among them the two men whose pres- ence was of more importance to Nora than that of all her other guests. Miss Wardleigh, after the first quadrille, had declined dancing; fond of the exercise though Clyde was, the exertion necessarily attendant upon her representation of the proud, yet loving Paul-   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         129 ine had fatigued her more than she had expected; and for once, she found it almost more pleasant to watch the dancers than to join their graceful evolutions. "I hope you do not intend to continue your treat- ment of me as Beauseant all evening," Clarke was saying as Nora came up; "you scorned me most em- phatically, Clyde; as though you really meant it - and treated Melnotte as if you were in truth Paul- ine." "I was, for the time," Clyde answered. "Miss Wardleigh forgot herself," Mr. Haynes said, "forgot herself in the part she was acting. Conse- quently, she did it well." "And she has found out what public applause means, to-night," Lille Lewis said, smiling at her friend. "It is a pleasant thing, Clyde, is it not?" "For once, yes," Clyde replied. ' But --" J"But what?"Nora asked, as Clyde    paused. "You have only spoken half your thought - give us the benefit of the rest." Go on, Miss Wardleigh," Mr. Bertrand said, as she hesitated for a moment. "I think I can almost guess what you were going to say -that the more of it one wins the more one wants. I am right, am I not?" "No,' Clyde said, smiling. "It was quite the re- verse, Mr. Bertrand. I was about to say that I tlought the less women had .to do itfhl public applause and notoriety, and, the less they placed themselves, in its way, the better for them and theirs." I  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7632-00000063"/> 130     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. "Is that a quiet acknowledgment of woman's infe- riority to man, Miss Wardleigh?"Robert Haynes asked, mischievously. ( Not at all, Mr. Haynes," Lille Lewis interrupted. "We don't acknowledge that at all. Clyde and I have talked the matter over a thousand times. She likes shade and obscurity for woman- nothing would induce her to become a Mrs. Browning, a Charlotte Cushman, a Charlotte Bront6, or, to come down from great things to small, a Susan B. Anthony or a Gail Hamilton. She might possibly be a Florence Night- ingale, but beyond that- no!" Lille's quizzical manner made them laugh. Clyde smiled. "I only said I should not care for such things my- self, Lille." "I would, if I only could get them," Lille said. "' But, alas! such grapes hang so very far beyond my reach, that I can only look on them at a distance, and console myself with the thought that -they must be very sour! Meantime, I am thankful to take what I can get; yes, with pleasure," she said to the. "Glavis " of the evening, who at that moment came to ask her to dance, a quick glance at the others, as she went off with her partner, telling that they might apply the last part of her speech to him or not, as they chose.. "I agree with Lille," Nora said. For my part, I would take all I could get, in the way, of applause or approbation: fame and distinction would be very pleasant things to win. And if one has the ability to- secure them, why not take them?"   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        131 "Some of us can't get them," Clarke said. "Or, to quote Mother Gqose, 'I would, if I could, If I could n't, how could I?'" "It does women no harm to try, Miss Wardleigh," Mr. 'Haynes said, after the laughter caused by Clarke's quotation had subsided, seeing that Clyde still looked unconvinced. "The road to Fame is as open to them as to us." "But, is it worth the cost we pay for it when won?  Clyde asked. Bertrand answered her in Melnotte's words: "Worth! What is a ribbon worth to a soldier? Worth - everything!  Glory is priceless!" "All against you, Clyde, even to our play itself," Nora said. "Own yourself fairly convinced." "No," Clyde said, "I am not, cannot be convinced. I still think that Fame is not worth the price we women must pay for its worthless laurels. We are told that we have unsexed ourselves, have stepped out of our sphere, if we seek admittance to any of the pro- fessions. Even in literature, the only career, after all, which is left open to us, why the mere rumor that a woman uses her pen is enough--let her be good, as a daughter; affectionate, as a sister; true, as a friend; modest and retiring, as a woman; faithful in every relation of life; fulfilling every duty; neglecting no claim upon her,-and yet no one, her own sex least of all - men are a little more generous - will give her  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7632-00000064"/> 132     CLYDE WARDLEIGI. credit for anything of this - she will be called strong- minded and unwomanly, only because she uses the talent committed to her charge." "Yet, would you have her conceal it, and 'fold it away in a napkin '?"Mr. Bertrand asked. "Not if she chooses to pay the price of a solitary life, an empty heart," Clyde said. "I would not think Fame worth winning; but then, I only speak for myself. I do not blame those who strive for it. But I am glad I have no talents to tempt me to win it- the happiest women are those who live in retirement, and whose names are never mentioned, in praise or in blame; and yet I am very much afraid that if I had the genius of Mrs. Browning, I might, in spite of my disapproval of the thing for myself, be tempted to employ the powers given me." "What a very serious discussion we have fallen into," Nora said, gayly, as Clyde stopped, blushing at jthe thought of her two long speeches. "Mr. Haynes, Miss Bertrand has no partner; Clarke, did you evei hear a more inspiring galop? Clyde, you are surely rested now, and Mr. Bertrand will gladly be your partner." And of course there was nothing left for them but to obey. The rest of the evening was but a repetition of many preceding ones, for all balls and parties have a strong family likeness, and the description of one, with a few changes in names and in dresses, will answer for a thousand. Robert Haynes was at liberty to devote himself to Ellen Bertrand, the "Glavis" of the   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        133 evening, who had been selected by Clarke to fill that part, because, as he maliciously whispered to Clyde, "Lloyd, though a very. good-natured and obliging fellow, was yet so confoundedly full of conceit and so much of a dandy that there would be no acting neces- sary on his part -he need only be himself to make a first-rate, Glavis" - and Clarke had spoken correctly, although he had been very careful to flatter that very conceit of William Lloyd's in persuading him to act, the "Glavis" of the evening had been Lille Lewis' shadow through the rest of the entertainment, and rc- port began to whisper that Mr. Lloyd, who imagined that with his well-known wealth he coiferred a favor upon every girl to whom he condescended to speak, who had been sought after and courted, had at last succumbed to Lille Lewis, bright, lively, free-spoken Lille Lewis. Nora had succeeded in detaining Clarke Henderson at her side, by letting him see, through a master-stroke of policy, that although she could see him any day and every day, she yet preferred this evening to be with him, " as," she said, "no one could possibly accuse her of flirting with her own cousin." And Clarke, seeing that Clyde was otherwise engaged, fell into the snare prepared for him by smiling lips and soft words, and was wholly at Nora's service. He is not the first, and will not be the last man led by a woman's will. Ralph Bertrand talked to Clyde; he cared very little for dancing, and he knew well enough that Nora had no wish, this evening, for his attend- ance upon her. He began to wonder what she meant 12     .  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7632-00000065"/> 134     CLYDE WARDLEEIGH. by it; he never for one moment doubted her loyalty to him, but he thought her conduct, to say the least of it, strange. He saw, clearly enough, as he thought, that he could now understand why Nora had given him her warning, for he was thrown constantly into con- tact with Clyde Wardleigh. Not by Clyde's act. Ralph Bertrand only saw that it was done. He could not tell by whose agency. He was wholly indifferent to her. Clyde was no more to him than was any other woman, but this evening circumstances had ,thrown them together, and he-felt in duty bound to try and make himself agreeable. He succeeded, too; he had read much and seen more; he had a thorough knowl- edge of the world - had mingled much in society - and, which perhaps is, after all, the very highest praise, he was, to sum up everything in a word, a gentleman. And so, for the remainder of the evening, he talked mostly with Clyde. A sort of acquaintance had grown -up between them, as necessarily will, when people have been thrown into as close-contact as these two had been during their preparations for the play; but this even- ing acquaintance changed, imperceptibly and uncon- sciously to both, into friendship, - and as Clyde bade Nora good-night, she could not help thinking, that although she had been too weary to dance, she had seldom spent a pleasanter evening. "After all," Clyde said to herself, as, late that even- ing, or rather early in the morning, she sought her bed, -( after all, I wonder if praise and compliments   CLYDE WARDILEIGH.         135- are not pleasant things? At any rate, Ralph Bertrand is; - were Nora to ask me now what I think of him, I could easily tell her -I like hitm."' And through Ellen Bertrand's dreams that night there moved but one figure, there spoke but one voice, and the form and the voice were those of Robert Haynes. CHAPTER XIT. "OVE OF DIFFERENT KINDS. "All thoughts, all passions, all delights, Whatever stirs this mortal frame; All are but ministers of love, Anid feed his sacred flame." - COLERIDGE. MSS REYNOLD'S was, if possible, more than content; and the chief part of her content was with her own pretty self, which in Nora's eyes was always the first, often the only consideration. She had planned and carried out her entertainment so well that it not only had cast Miss Bertrand's birthnight-ball into the shade, but, compared with its splendor and success, all the lesser lights of parties and soirees paled into insignifi- cance. It was surely enough to inspire Nora with full content. This, the preliminary step in her plan, had been crowned with such complete and unqualified success that it gave her every hope for the future. The  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7632-00000066"/> 136     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. tangled web she was striving to weave was fairly begun. She held the leading threads in her own hand. Her quick eye saw that one grand point was gained, -that Clyde had ceased to look upon Ralph Bertrand as a mere acquaintance. The next point would be to make Clarke Henderson think that the heart he prized had been given to another. This accomplished, the rest would be easy. A. few gentle, sympathetic words, a little use of Nora's consummate tact, and Clarke, disappointed in one quarter, would, she thought, gladly turn to pluck and enjoy the fra- grange of the sweet flower which was so willing to seek his hand. As to Clyde, Nora regarded her merely as a means to an end; and as little did she think of Ralph Bertrand, except as, one of the stepping-stones by aid of which she would cross the mire of difficulty which lay between herself and the object she desired to attain. She cared nothing, in fact she never thought, nor would she have cared to think, as a less selfish woman might have done, of the suffering her actions might entail upon others. Even had the thought occurred to her, she would not have hesitated for a moment. It was nothing to her that Ralph Bertrand's hopes of happiness might be blighted, that Clyde Wardleigh might in truth learn to love lim,--such lessons are easily learned, - and thus both be doomed to suffer and bear the pain of unreturned affection. Nora would have cared nothing for all this; her only thought was how to win Clarke Henderson; her only   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        137 hope was to secure her own happiness. But not for one moment did she think of dissolving her engage- ment with Mr. Bertrand. Clarke failing her, she had him to fall back upon; and Nora had a holy horror, as women of her stamp generally have, of becoming an old maid. Ralph Bertrand, intelligent, gentlemanly, able to make his mark in the world, was a bird in the hand entirely too valuable to be allowed to escape until Nora had secured to herself what she considered his full equivalent. He was the last trump in her hand, only to be played in case of necessity, when the game should be nearly won. And, inconsistent as it may seem, while no spark of love warmed Nora Reynolds' heart towards Ralph Bertrand, and she felt at liberty to let her own fancy wander as it would, she would have been bitterly angry and intensely jealous had she thought that even for a moment he could waver from his truth and loy- alty to her. She must be first--first in his heart and in his thoughts; none other should have any right to what was hers, no matter how lightly she might value it. She gave little herself, but she expected much in return. It was almost as if she had said, "I may do as I please myself, but I deny you that privilege; you must act according to my wishes, and not according to. your own." It was intense selfishness, no doubt, but a selfish- ness which wore such an attractive disguise that no one guessed at its true nature; for Nora had the power of making people think with her, and, by deli- 12*  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7632-00000067"/> 138     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. cately flattering their especial vanity, which she was quick to discover, not only making them feel satisfied with themselves and with her, but guiding them as she would. Such women are few in number, but there are some of them scattered here and there through this world of ours - few in number, thank heaven, yet they do exist, and Nora Reynolds was one of them. Lent came that year unusually early, and in conse- quence the gayety of the city was crowded into a few short weeks. Moving, as they did, in the same social circle, those with whom our story has mostly to deal were thrown constantly together. They met, evening after evening, at different houses, until Nora declared at last that she thought Philadelphia society was be- coming so fearfully monotonous that her ideas were exhausted and stagnating, and the sight of a new face occasionally would be such a treat that she would scarcely be able fully to realize and appreciate it. "How can you call it monotonous, Nora?"Ellen Bertrand, to whom this speech was addressed, asked. "It has been anything but monotonous to me. I don't think I ever spent as pleasant a winter as this has been." "Ah, but then we all have not your reason for thinking it pleasant, Nell," was Nora's gay reply. "Perhaps, under similar circumstances, I, like you, might think it high treason to hear any one complain of monotony; but, my dear, you see things from one point of view; I look upon them from another. How-   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         139 ever, I am willing to acknowledge that, upon the whole, it has been quite a satisfactory sort of a winter." She had reason to call it satisfactory. Clark e Heni- derson thought his cousin had never been as charming and as pleasant as sle had been this winter, and Nora had not been slow to perceive this; for Clarke had one of those gentle, affectionate natures, which, while they are very sensitive to coldness or to ridicule, are yet easily won by the least expression of interest in them. And Nora, knowing this, had interested her- self in Clarke's pursuits; had led him to speak freely to her of his plans, his hopes, his wishes; had given him the synmpathly which, to natures like his, is as absolutely necessary as is pure air to life. It was the best way to win him. It undoubtedly would have succeeded at once, had not Clarke's heart been long since given to another. As it was, Nora held the second place in it; she was dear to him as a sister. He never for one moment, - whatever faults Clarke Henderson may have had, conceit was not one of them,--h e never for one moment dreamed that Nora's feelings towards him were any but those of a sister; he never guessed how hard it was for her to sit and listen, as she did, to his words on the one topic of which he never wearied,-- his love for Clyde; his hopes that at some future day he might attain suffi- cient distinction in literature to allow him to feel that he had something worth offering for her acceptance. He lived in the same house with Nora, and never guessed that the only womanly feeling in her selfish  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7632-00000068"/> "O     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. heart was love for him; and that the praises he lav- ished on Clyde only made Nora hate her more cor- dially, and resolve more earnestly, - while in words she agreed with everything her cousin said, - that her unconscious rival should be set aside, no. matter what it cost, and Clarke be won by herself. As it was, she had gained Clarke's entire confidence, though she only knew what it cost her; for no harder thing could have been given Nora to endure than praise of Clyde from Clarke's lips. Still, he trusted her, and that was a great point gained. Although Nora had called the winter monotonous, Clyde, like Ellen, had enjoyed it. There had been but one drawhack to her pleasure, and that had not greatly disturbed her. It was this, that she had never been very strong or able to stand any violent exercise. Yet her general health had always been good; she never remembered having had one day's sickness. Her spirits 'were high, and she was always cheerful and happy; it was only that she found she could not now dance as she once could. The rapid, exhilarating motion produced a sort of dizziness, fol- lowed by such a weary, tired sensation, that Clyde found she must, sorely against her will, give up the inspiring galop and the graceful waltzes of which she had been so fond, and limit herself solely to the more' quiet square dances. Trifling as this circumstance may appear, it-was yet to bring serious consequences with it. It was very hard for Clyde to sit still and see her friends dance,   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        141 while she could not, for she was passionately fond of the exercise. Once or twice the temptation proved too great, but the penalty she paid was too severe; and Clyde, wondering in herself why this should be the only thing -which affected her, gave up, very re- luctantly, be it confessed, the exercise of which she had been so fond.  Mrs. Bertrand, feeling uneasy about her niece, consulted Lille's father, Dr. Lewis; but, after a few questions to Clyde, he only said: "A natural consequence of round dances. I know of nothing, except a top, which can spin and twirl without becoming dizzy; and as Clyde is not a top, she cannot stand it. I advise her to let it alone." And Clyde did " let it alone." She found that her not dancing did not, as she had at first feared, inter- fere with her enjoyment. It brought, to be sure, a different set of men around her,--men who cared more for conversation than for dancing. Clyde Ward- leigh was not a brilliant, clever woman, but she pos- sessed that strange charm which attracts men, though women never see or acknowledge it, and which gives to such a girl's lightest, most trifling word a power which cannot be described; and wherever she was, that was the most attractive part of the room for the gentlemen. And among those who now surrounded Miss Wardleigh, Ralph Bertrand was to be found. He was ho dancer, while Nora was indefatigable in that line, and he was glad to find one at least among his lady acquaintinces who was not wholly engrossed with the fashionable dances of the period.  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7632-00000069"/> "2     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. And presently Clyde began to consider the moments spent in his society the pleasantest part of her even- ings. She wondered why it was so; he never paid her compliments in words, except the great one of letting her see, by his seeking her society, that he enjoyed it. He never descended to small talk or gossip; he never sent her. books, music, or flowers, as Clarke and others constantly did; he was not hand- somer, not more agreeable, and more indifferent to her than many others; and yet, before very long, Clyde knew that in meeting him she had at last met her fate, --that no one ever had, or ever would have, the power and influence over her that he might have, did he only choose to seek it. In a word, she loved him, and it was with a bitter pang that Clyde felt and learned that, unsought and unasked, she had given away her heart. Yet, after all, and unconsciously, unintentionally as it was on her part, her love had been given to no unworthy object. He deserved it. No one spoke of him, no one mentioned him, except in words of praise. It was not as though she had laid this priceless jewel as tribute at the feet of one all unworthy to possess it, unknowing how to value it. But then, he had not sought to win it. She was no more to him than were thousands of others; he had never thought of her, never sought to make her love him, and every impulse of Clyde's truly womanly nature rose up in pain at this thought. It was real, acute pain. She blamed herself over and over for it, as if such things can be   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        143 helped. She struggled against it; she tried to conquer it; but in vain. For in him she had met her other half, her true mate, her twin soul; and, to use a musical phrase, she felt and knew that every tone of his nature accorded and harmonized with her own; that together they would form one rich, melodious chord, its various notes blending together and swelling into one grand, rich, satisfying harmony of life. In no one else could she find this fitness, this congeniality, this oneness of soul; and with this thought came the sting that it was only evident to herself; that, al- though she so fully saw and understood the intensity of the joy' of what might be, she never could put forth her hand to grasp it - it must be offered to her, and Clyde saw plainly enough that this thought, the thought of love for her, which alone could prompt the gift and make it worth the offering, had never entered Ralph Bertrand's mind. It was all the harder to bear, because, as Clyde thought, there was no reason why she should be shut out from the sweet fairyland whose borders she could only view from a distance, seeing, understanding, real- izing its full beauty; longing to wander in it; seeing others, seemingly no more deserving of it than her- self, admitted into this fair region of enchantment, in the which, at some period of our lives, 'we all have wandered. It is a blessed dream, a glimpse of heaven, a glad elysium while it lasts; but too often the rich fruit we have so eagerly sought, proves, when pos- sessed, only bitterness: the apparently smooth and  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7632-00000070"/> "4     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. flower-strewn path is full of thorns: and yet here and there are found some to whom the fairy glamour never changes-the flowers are as bright and the scenes as fair, if not fairer and brighter, after long years, as in the days of their early enchantment. And, feeling all this, Clyde had before her daily, as if the intuitive teachings of her own gentle heart were not enough, the sight of all that happy love might be. For to Ellen, too, had come the one romance of woman's life, the sweet romance, the dear old story, old as the world itself, and begun in Eden; yet ever young, ever new in the telling, and never ending. It had come, as such things will, differently from the way in which it had come to Clyde; and Ellen, in the joy of her heart, could truthfully say that she had never spent a more pleasant winter--and yet in her heart feel that such words, that any words she could employ, must and would fall far short of describing the reality. For her, the course of true love was to run smooth. The little bark of love, freighted with the rich cargo of the lopes and happiness of two human hearts, wafted by favoring winds, meeting no obstacles, was for once to float safely on to its desired haven. Ellen Bertrand's life would hold no story, it would be only a simple, every-day, eventless routine; yet such lives are in truth thp happiest, for an eventful life is generally a stormy one; and the sweetest, rarest summer days are those which grow calmly from morning into noon, and flow with equal calmness from noontime into the peaceful rest and quiet of night. Ellen was deeply   CLYDE WARDLEIGa,        145 grateful for her happiness, and after the first natural pain was over, whichl they felt at the thought that their only child had given the first place in her heart to a stranger, both Mr. and Mrs. Bertrand were happy in seeing their daughter's happiness; -and they very soon began to feel that they would gain a son by Ellen's marriage, which was to be deferred for some months. But at first, much as they liked Robert Haynes, and fully as they approved of him, both Mr. and Mrs. Bertrand would greatly have preferred, had the affair been left to them, that Ellen's choice should have fallen upon her cousin-both parties being willing. Besides the natural grief they had felt at the death of little Georgie, their only son, it had always been a' subject of deep regret to them that in losing him they lost the hope of directly perpetuating a name of which the family had always been so proud, handed down, as it had been, from father to son, with stainless scutcheon and blameless honor. In his nephew, Mr. Bertrand\ saw a fit representative of the family; and as he had been deprived of his own son, he would have been glad to give Ralph Georgie's place, and to have bound him still closer to them by a marriage between Ellen and himself. Mrs. Bertrand was no match-maker; she could not understand why some mothers seemed so anxious to part with their daughters; she wished to keep hers with her; and though her own married life had been a very happy one, she thought such things were best allowed to take their own natural course. She was not 13        K  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7632-00000071"/> "6     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. anxious to give up either of her two daughters - for she never separated Clyde and Ellen in her thoughts -but she knew that some time or other it was alto- gether probable that her girls would leave her for homes of their own, and yet she shared her husband's wishes respecting his nephew. But as this could not be, and Ellen's choice had in truth been a wise one, Mrs. Bertrand, because her daughter loved him, took Robert Haynes to her heart; and his own merits soon won for him, for his own sake, what had first been igiven him on account of another. Ellen never knew what her parents' wishes had really been. There was no necessity for it; even had "it lain in their power to carry them out, they would both have shrunk from, and been unwilling to assume the responsibility of such an act. Once, indeed, in conversation with Ralph, Mr. Bertrand had said to him that he sincerely wished he were his son, instead of his nephew. And the young man had thanked his uncle for his good opinion of him, and expressed the hope that he might always be able -to retain it; and had then hesitated for a moment, as though there was something more he wished to say; but he checked him- self, and began to speak in the highest terms of Robert Haynes.  Mr. Bertrand wondered if indeed Ralph had felt more than cousinly interest in Ellen, and if he had been deterred from speaking by the fear that he might stand in his friend's way. But Mr. Bertrand was too much of a gentleman to- ask Ralph why he had hesi-   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        147 -tated about speaking freely before him. He thought none the less of his nephew for his silence; he perhaps admired him all the more for his caution. lie little suspected how far he had been from the truth. Ralph Bertrand had at that moment been de- bating within himself whether or not he should confide to his uncle the fact of his engagement. He was anx- ious to speak; tfie only thing which deterred him was the recollection that Nora had made him promise that the affair should not be made public until such time as she saw fit. Hle could not understand why Miss Reynolds should be so very unwilling to have the en- gagement known; it was so different from the usual course; and yet he took a sort of satisfaction in the thought that his betrothed was not unreasonable; for Mwhile she did as she pleased, she laid no restraint upon him, but allowed him the same privilege she herself enjoyed. He was rather glad that she made so few demands upon his time. He was fond of his profession, and ambitious of rising to distinction in it. This, of course, would require close study and careful atten- tion, and he was not sorry that he was able to devote himself to its requirements. Had he really loved Nlora, this would have been but a secondary consid- eration, at least for a time; as it was, it was more his fancy than his heart that was interested, else Miss Reynolds might have found her betrothed much less easily satisfied and manageable than he was. He had first met Nora in Baltimore, wheie she had  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7632-00000072"/> t48     CLYDE WARDLEIGI. been visiting her relatives. When Miss Reynolds saw fit, she could he exceedingly agreeable; and there were few men who could resist her, if she once decided to try her powers of fascination upon them. Nor did they in this case fail her. By her perfect tact, her thorough knowledge of and confidence in her own powers, her ability to make people think as she did, she led Ralph Bertrand on, step by step, till at last he asked her, in plain, straightforward words, to be his wife. He must marry some day, he had thought; a man with neither home nor family ties is but a creature deserving pity. He admired Nora, and he might as well marry her as any one else. Her family and her social position were good; she lived in Philadelphia, the city he intended making his home; she was pretty, graceful, and attractive. He might as well marry her as any one else, for she pleased his fancy; and so he made the proposal which Nora had accepted. He did not know that if he really had loved her, none of these rather calculating thoughts would have entered his mind; he would have thought of Nora, and not of her accessories. And yet he liked to be with her; he had a certain pride in the pretty little brunette who could be so very charming when she pleased; he liked to think that she belonged to him; and, after working all day over law-books, special pleadings, or dull papers, the usual routine of his legal business, he enjoyed, when Nora would grant it to him, the gay, bright talk at which she was so very apt.' A little more, and he would have loved   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        149 her; as it was, he fully intended to marry her, never knowing that it was only a sort of fascination which he had mistaken for love, never guessing that deep in his heart there lay capabilities for loving, whose ex- istence he had never suspected, because they had never been aroused: in fact, he sometimes thought himself incapable of deep feeling. He would not hurry Nora; he was content to wait her convenience; their marriage would come in due time. And it would have turned-out as so many marriages do nowadays, when men, aye, and women too, fascinated by fair seeming, thinking only of the passion of the present, pay for a brief infatuation by a lifetime of regret, only they know how heartfelt. Ralph Bertrand had seen nothing unusual in his own position until after his cousin's engagement to his partner. Until then, he had never given the subject much thought; he had taken his position as a mere matter of course. But Haynes was so different; he spent every moment that he could spare from his busi- ness with Ellen; everything he did had some refer- ence to her; she influenced his every action; since his engagement he was a new being. And seeing all this, Ralph Bertrand's eyes began to be opened,'and by slow, slow degrees, although he tried to put it away as unworthy of himself and unjust to Nora, the sus- picion dawned upon him that all was not exactly as it should be, that his case was a decided exception to the general rule; and, lawyer-like, he began to ask him- self why this was, and to try and find out all the whys and wherefores of the case. 13 *  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7632-00000073"/> 150     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. It never for one moment occurred to Nora Reynolds that possibly Ralph Bertrand might be dissatisfied with her entire independence of him. She had told him that until their marriage she claimed and expected perfect liberty of action; her manner to him in their rather unfrequent interviews was perfection, and she thought that should content him. He had hitherto been as plastic wax in her hands; thngs had gone on so much as she desired that she began to look forward very confidently to full success in Carrying out the complicated network of intrigue in which she had involved herself. Only she noticed that Ralph Ber- trand's visits were becoming more frequent, that he spent more time with her than he had previously done; and she concluded from this that her influence over him was greater than ever.

CLYDE WARDLEIIGH        151 "Not for some time; I expect to go after a while." "And I guess Miss Ellen she don't care for the parties now; does she, Miss Clyde?" And Mina put on a most knowing look; for the little drama which had been played in the parlor had not passed unnoticed or uncommented upon in the servants' hall. "I don't see why Miss Ellen don't care for the parties now," that young lady said, entering the room as Mina spoke. "I like them as much as I ever did, Mina; why should I not?" "I just thought perhaps you did n't, Miss Ellen." But I think I do," Ellen said, while Clyde lay on the lounge, vainly trying to conceal her amusement. "I don't see anything to laugh at, Clyde; go on, Mina, and tell me why parties should have lost their charm." "I don't know nothin' about their charm, Miss Ellen; only, you see, you 've got him once, and--" The expression on Mina's face said more thanlher words. So you think Miss Ellen ought to settle down at once, Mina?"Clyde said. "They mostly does when they get their man, Miss Clyde. Miss Ellen she's got a nice man, too; I let him in the other night when I was standing out front, and he said, 'Good evenin', Mina.' He's a real gen- tleman, one of the right sort, Miss Ellen; he ain't too proud to speak to folks when he knows them. He 's a nice man, and a pretty man too." "So Mr. Haynes meets with your approbation,  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7632-00000074"/> 152     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. Mina," Clyde said, for Ellen was too much amused to speak. "I don't know nothin' about approbation, Miss Clyde, but I knows when people are nice; and some folks ain't. And when your man comes, Miss Clyde, I hope he'll be a nice one." "Don't make Miss Clyde laugh, Mina," Ellen said. "It's Lent, you know, and people don't go to parties, or have any fun, nowadays." "I guess Miss Ellen must always have her fun," Mina said. "If it ain't the parties, it's something else; she just likes to have a good time, and she gets it, too." "I don't think Miss Clyde feels very funny to-day, Mina," Ellen went on, looking at her cousin. "Poor child! she has such a bad headache, if one only could cure it!"            - Mina's expression changed at once. "Miss Clyde would n't have her headache very long if I could cure it for her." "I have laughed it all away, Mina," Clyde said, smiling; "so I think that you cured me after all." And I came in to tell you, Clyde, that Clarke will call for us in half an hour to take us sleighing; and we have no time to lose in getting ready," Ellen said. "Mina's nonsense put it out of my head, so she will have to wait on us now and help us as much as she can." But this was no hardship to Mina, who liked noth- ing better than talking to, and helping her young   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        153 ladies; and servant though she was, Ellen and Clyde had no firmer, truer admirer than the homely little maid who waited upon them; and with her help they were soon ready for the sleigh-ride. Lent had come, and with its advent the gayety of the city had come to an abrupt conclusion. Ellen did not regret it; she enjoyed the evenings spent at home in her lover's company far more than the crowded entertainments, at which they could only exchange a few words, unless they had chosen, by a too evident preference for each other's society, to make them- selves conspicuous, and subject to remarks. Clyde was too fond of her home, and enjoyed seeing the friends who met there in the evening, and was be-- sides too consistent a member of the Episcopal Church, to care about devoting a whole winter to gayety. Nora submitted to it, because it was fashionable, and the correct thing; and because, as she said, a little rest, after all the late hours she had been keeping, was good for her, parties did run any one down so terribly; and yet at the bottom of her heart Nora thought that one day in seven was enough to devote to religion; and she seriously objected to the six weeks of fasting and self-denial prescribed by the Church of which she was a nominal member. She cared less about Lent's coming this year than she ever had done before. The game she was playing required close and careful attention; one mistake, how- ever trifling, would make her lose it. Her first object had of course been to make herself absolutely neces-  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7632-00000075"/> 154     CLYDE WARDLEIGIH sary to Clarke. His tastes were essentially domestic, and now that Nora's engagements no longer called her out every evening, she had ample leisure to consult them. He was fond of chess. Nora hated the game, but she studied it, so that she might play with him; she copied his manuscripts for him; she hunted out references for him; she coaxed him into reading to her, as he wrote it, the novel uponA which he was engaged, for Clarke was tired of writing short articles, and had dashed boldly into a book; she praised it when she could, not failing, however, to blame it when it was deserved, for Clarke was a good judge of his own writ- ings, and unqualified praise, when it was not merited, would have been unwelcome. The hours 'from six to eight every evening were hers, and she used them; her fbrtune favored her again, for a case was placed in Mr. Bertrand's hands, which, requiring much close atten- tion and careful research and study, filled up most of his time; and left Nora at liberty to follow her own inclinations without fear of being interrupted by his entrance. For those two hours, then, she had Clarke to her- self, and he began to think them pleasant hours. But after the clock struck eight, Nora could not hope to detain her cousin with her; that low, silvery chime from the mantel was usually the signal for the door- bell to ring, and visitors to be admitted, for Miss Rey- nolds was never allowed to pass a solitary evening. And then Clarke, who seldom remained at home when gentlemen called on Nora, would take his hat, and   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        155 fild his way to the house which he considered the pleasantest in Philadelphia, the house of the Ber- trands. There, too, Ralph Pertrand fell into the way of going. His uncle had given him a cordial invitation to come in whenever he chose; and he was only too glad to avail himself of the opportunity for enjoying the sweet, home-like atmosphere pervading the whole house, which is so charming to those whose fate has cast them upon the cold mercies of a boarding-house, or subjected them to the showy discomfort of an hotel. He could go there at any hour, and always feel sure of a welcome from his uncle and aunt. The case now in his hands occupied the early part of his evenings, and it was almost always nine o'clock before he could leave his office. It was then too late, if he wished to see Nora alone, for him to go to the Reynolds. He took little satisfaction in going there, only to be one more in the crowd of men who gathered around Miss Reynolds every evening, and so he had adopted the plan of going, when he could, to visit her before the hours for callers; and now that the time which he had previously devoted to her was otherwise taken up, he had told Nora not to expect him. She had been very much disappointed, of course; had said many pretty things about missing him, and of her loneliness with- out him; but she inwardly rejoiced at the unexpected manner in which he was, unconsciously, playing into her hands. And so, evening after evening, he and Clarke Hen-  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7632-00000076"/> 156     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. derson found their way to the Bertrand fireside. Clarke's visits were so much a matter of course that no one noticed his coming or going; he was no restraint upon them, they went on with their usual avocations when he was present, talked or not, as they felt dis- posed; in a word, they treated him as one of them- selves, and it was not long before Ralph Bertrand stood upon the same footing. Not till then did he begin to understand why it was that Clyde Wardleigh was considered so very attrac- tive. He had often wondered where the secret lay; he knew that some of the best men in the city would have been proud to share their fortunes with her; he had heard many speak of her wonderful charm, but until now it had escaped him. He had thought her a pretty, graceful girl, with manners which were easy and pleasant enough, but he gave her credit for no higher intellectual powers than were possessed by half the girls and young women he met. In fact, he was inclined to take Nora as his standard, and judge others by her; and indeed, Nora's bright beauty, gay manner, and quickness at repartee, often threw Clyde's quiet, ladydlike bearing, and fair, refined loveliness, into the shade, as a strong perfume overpowers one more deli- cate. Thrown, as Bertrand had been, chiefly among the free, easy, and independent girls of the present day, the true womanliness which was Clyde's great charac- teristic had hitherto escaped his notice, and it was not until he saw her, as he now did, at home, that he began to appreciate her. -Ie saw her as daug!tecr,   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         157 sister, friend; he saw how dear she was to the aunt and uncle who had adopted her as their own; he saw how the girl he had thought almost uninteresting, with her calm face and quiet manner, in society, shone in her true colors in the retirement of home, - the place where a woman should be seen to be best judged at her true worth; and at last, unconsciously to himself, he began to compare Clyde and Nora, and with results not always favorable to the latter. Few, however, were admitted, as he was, to what might be called the " inner life" of the&amp; Bertrands. Two evenings in the week were set apart for receiving their large circle of acquaintances, when any friends who chose to come were welcomed; but at other times only those who enjoyed the privilege of intimacy were admitted. Mr. and Mrs. Bertrand, though living in and 'enjoying society, would not give up all the pleas- ures of home; and, in every sense of the word, theirs was indeed a home. During the season for balls and parties, this rule, of course, had to be set aside; but as soon as these dissipations were over, the quiet home evenings began again and were enjoyed. They were pleasant evenings, too; with their easy flow of talk, in which each one bore a part, for the circle gathered around the low grate in the library, which all agreed was the most pleasant room in the house, and was never too large for general conversation. ]len and Mr. Haynes bore their part in it; unlike most engaged people, they were not so selfishy engrossed in one another as to care to separate themselves from the family at all times, "  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7632-00000077"/> - 158    CLYDE WARDLEIGH. and for at least a part of the evening they were to be found in their places with the rest. Ellen played well, and her musical abilities were always at the service of her friends. Clyde's voice, sweet but not powerful, was only to be heard at home; she never would sing in general society, but in her own home she never re- fused; and there was nothing Mr. Bertrand enjoyed more than first listening to Ellen's brilliant playing, and then bidding Clyde bring her guitar, and sing him some of the soft, plaintive old ballads which suited her voice, and which, though the tastes of the present day may call them old-fashioned and out of date, will yet never lose their sweetness and melody. Such evenings as these were full of a restful charm to men plunged all day in the busy, noisy, endless whirl of a great city. Nora would have called them stupid and humdrum; to Clyde they were perfect en- joyment. They brought together the people for whom she cared most, and never before had she been so happy. She wondered now how the first year of her life with the Bertrands could have been so miserable; it seemed to her now that the Clyde Wardleigh of that time and the Clyde Wardleigh-of the present were not and could not be the same. It was the very happiest time of her life, despite the knowledge that she had given away her heart; for every evening brought Ralph Bertrand to the house, and every evening Clyde lay down to rest with the remembrance of his words in her mind and the prayer that some day she might be worthy to win his love. She did not know that,   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        159 unconsciously, unintentionally, she had betrayed herself and her true feelings to the man from whom she was most anxious to conceal them. Such knowledge would have filled her with maidenly shame, that a thing she scarcely dared confess to herself should be known! For though Clyde prayed that this great gift might some day be hers, she was no love-sick igirl to parade and seek sympathy for her feelings. ' She took this knowledge, as such knowledge, when it does come to us, should be taken, calmly, tranquilly, with the deter- mination that, let the result be what it might, she would at least try to be content. It was no fault of hers that the feeling had come-the fault would be no weakly indulgence of it. But its consciousness had changed Clyde; from a girl she had become a woman. To all save to one, it was only a gentler manner, a certain dainty shyness, a sweeter tone in the sweet voice, nothing more. What it was that had made Ralph Bertrand suspect the truth he could not say. He called himself a conceited fool for thinking it of Clyde Wardleigh; he put the thought away' from him, but it would return. He had. no right to think it; why might not Clarke Henderson be the favored one? more likely he, than himself. But no, the thought would come back, let him try to banish it as he might. He asked himself what grounds he had for the suspicion; her manner was probably more friendly to Clarke than to himself, her conversation was addressed mostly to her old friend. It was only / that once or twice, on addressing her suddenly, a soft,  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7632-00000078"/> 160     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. rosy flush, like the blush of the young moss-rose, had for a moment tinged the fair purity of Clyde's cheek, a tender light had filled the deep violet eye at his greet- ing. Nothing more,--the calm manner had never changed, not a tone in the sweet voice had altered, not a stray glance had ever-he had watched her-sought him; and yet Ralph Bertrand knew, and liked him- self all the less that it pleased him to know it, that Clyde loved him. Unconsciously, he thought, and hoped she never would learn it. He saw-for Clarke, open as the day, made no attempt to conceal his feel- ings-that around Clyde all his hopes and wishes had centred, and he thought it barely possible that in time they might win their reward. It was barely possible, however, Clarke Henderson was scarcely the man to please Clyde's fancy. Ralph wondered if he ought to give up his visits at his uncle's, but that thought was dismissed at once; he had too much regard for Clyde's delicacy; his must not be the hand to enlighten her, which such a course would most assuredly have done. He resolved to go on as heretofore, and to let well enough alone. Only he was conscious that he himself took much more interest in Clyde than he had ever before done. Yet, wishing to do right, he neglected, from a mistaken sense of honor, the only right thing which was left for him to do-the prompt and immediate acknowledgment of his engagement to Nora Reynolds. He thought of it, it is true, but he could not speak without her consent; and that she persistently refused. And so the days went by, apparently calmly and   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        161 quietly, and no one saw or dreamed of the storm which slowly but surely was gathering, and which, at no dis- tant day, would break over their heads. Not till all -was over did they who bore the consequences see how all could have been prevented-how many signs there had been of what was to come: but the peace of the present had blinded them, and when their eyes were opened it was - too late! CHAPTER XIV. CLARKE HENDERSON'S BOOK. For seldom shall she hear a tale So sad, so tender, and so true. - SHENSTONE. nORA   REYNOLDS was beginning to be very tired of what she called the monotony of her present life. Sleighing, promenading, and visiting were all very well in their way; but then the first nearly froze you, the second tired you, and the third was a necessary evil. She was talked out, she wanted a change, she was tired of being good; she thought that a brief absence might perhaps show Clarke how necessary she was to him; it might further her plans and brighten up her wits. And so one day when Ralph  Bertrand called to see her, he was informed that Nora had gone, that very morning, to visit a friend in New York; that she would be absent for some little time; "*        L  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7632-00000079"/> 162     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. and Ralph Bertrand could not but feel, and blamed himself for feeling, that just now Miss Reynolds' absence was almost a relief. "How long was Miss Reynolds to be absent?" he inquired of the man who had answered his ring; and he was told that "Miss Nora had said she did not know exactly how long she should be away, but cer- tainly for several weeks." He would not ask if either note or message had been left for him, although he thought it strange, under the circumstances, that Nora should have left the city without a word to him. But on returning to his office he found-Nora was too cautious, too observant of the proprieties of etiquette to have neglected it -a few lines from the young lady herself, saying that she had unexpectedly decided to make a long promised visit to an old school-mate living in New York; that the length of her stay was uncertain, but that as soon as she returned to Philadelphia he should be informed of her arrival. And then, although there was not the most distant reference to her in it, there passed through Ralph Bertrand's mind the thought that Clyde Ward- leigh could never have written such a cold, formal note--a note which any one' might have written or read - to her future husband, or have left so abruptly. For the first time he wished that Nora was more like her; but then, laying down the scented, delicately written note, ie murmured: "As if one could expect them all to be cast in the same mould! Well, well, there are women, and women!"   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        163 And then --it would have shocked Miss Reynolds' dainty ideas had she known it--her pretty little note was carelessly twisted up, and used to light the cigar which Ralph selected wherewith to indulge himself before he seated himself at his table in order to look over the law-papers accumulated there, and the pile of letters which had just been handed in by that very useful member of society, the postman. Meantime, Clarke Henderson was anxiously await- ing the publication-of his book. For it not only was finished, but it had passed safely through that ordeal so dreaded, and justly, by authors, of scrutiny by that nameless, mysterious individual spoken of in publish- ing houses as "our reader," from whose decisions there is no appeal, and whose verdict upon a book seals its acceptance or rejection. But Clarke's work had been approved; he had read and corrected the "proof,"-a task which almost always, unless one happens to possess an uncommonly good opinion of one's self, disgusts a writer with his work, so very dif- ferently do the same words appear in manuscript and in print,- and in a very short time the result of his labors would be given to the public. They had been labors" to Clarke; for, with a degree of persever- ance unusual in him, he had written and re-written his book, till, as he laughingly said to Clyde, the quantity of good writing-paper he had spoiled was positively enormous. But he had become interested in his work: he wrote with an object in view; and although several times he had felt tempted to throw the whole thing  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7632-00000080"/> 164     CLYDE WARDLEIG rT. aside, and take another plot to work out, he had, thanks to Nora, who by her interest in it helped to keep him at work, finished it at last. The plot of his story had given him little, if any, trouble. Among some old papers which Mr. Rey- nolds, some months previously, had requested him to destroy, first looking over them to see if possibly there could be anything of any importance among them - among these old papers, which had lain for years, dusty, musty, and worm-eaten, in the garret, Clarke had found the germ and groundwork of his story. The task his uncle had assigned him was very much more to his taste than the dry, legal copying, and look- ing up of uninteresting old reports of cases, which generally fell to Clarke's share in the few rare hours he spent in his office; where, though L. Clarke Hen- derson, Attorney-at-Law, as his sign called him, was supposed to be seen during business hours, he yet was very seldom to be found. But among these old papers, the looking over which Clarke really enjoyed, among the collection of old bills, letters, receipts, valueless deeds, notes and accounts, the accumulation, probably, of years, he found something which, as he thought, amply repaid him for any trouble the examination had given him. Tied up carefully by themselves was a package of letters, written by two persons; and- a journal, evidently written by one of them. Clarke had read one of the letters, carelessly at first, to see if possibly there was anything in the correspondence; but it had interested him so much that he had saved ,/   CLYDE WARDLEIGII.        165 the letters and the journal from the fire to which the rest of the papers had been consigned. On the story told in these letters and in this little book, Clarke had founded his novel; he found, upon inquiry, that they had been written by a great-grandaunt of his own, who, dying young and unmarried, had left no descend- ants who could in any way object to the telling of their ancestress' love story, and so he had not hesitated about using the material thus strangely thrown in his way. -Something in the style of the letters, old-fash- ioned though they were, had reminded him of Clyde, and so he had faintly shadowed her forth in his heroine. He had, however, used the author's privilege of changing and modernizing his story. The time has gone by for stories of the past; and Clarke knew, that, to please the public, he must lay the scene of his book in the present day. It was easy enough to do: the love story of a hundred years since, with a few altera- tions to suit the spirit of the times, is the love story of to-day; and, the foundation once laid, it was easy enough to build up the superstructure of fiction to please himself. He had called his story, "Under a Cloud," because it seemed to him that from the very first page of the book its ending was foreshadowed. It was not the ending Clarke would have preferred, but the story almost seemed to tell itself, as it grew under his hands as he wrote, until no other conclusion seemed possible, without spoiling the story; and so he let it, as it were, shape itself.  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7632-00000081"/> 166     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. It was all finished now; and Clarke waited, know- ing that he had done his best. And at last his patient waiting was rewarded, for one morning there came, to Clarke Henderson, Esq., a package containing several copies of his work, out at last in all the glory of neat binding, good paper, and clear letter-press. Author and publisher had done their work, he must now wait for the verdict of the public. He sent a copy at once to Ellen and Clyde. His first intention had been to take it to them himself, but on second thought he decided to send the little volume and wait till evening to make his usual visit. Most unexpectedly, however, just as he was leaving the house that evening, he met an old college chum, who, passing through the city, had stopped to see him. Clarke could do nothing less than give the evening to his friend; and the next morning Mr. Reynolds had some work for him Which could not be neglected, and consequently evening came before he felt at liberty to go to the Bertrands. It seemed a long day to Clarke; but evening came at last. He was anxious to see his friends, and yet he was almost fearful of meeting them. He had always refused to let either Ellen or Clyde read his book in manuscript, telling them that if it ever attained to the dignity of print they should be at liberty to criticise it as much as they pleased. He knew that by this time they must have read it; and although his heart beat fast as he rang the- bell, he hoped he had but little to fear from his friends. "We owe you a grudge, Clarke," Ellen said, after   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        167 the usual greetings were over. ." Both Clyde and I have been threatening to quarrel with you, and to scold you; and you know you richly merit both." "I am wholly unconscious of having given any offence, Ellen," Clarke said, laughingly, "and don't intend to offer any apology until I know why one is expected of me." "It is nothing very formidable, Clarke," Clyde said, as she drew his chair into the circle around the fire. "Nell scolded all last evening because you did not come, and then vowed vengeance against you, when she should see you." At that moment the library-door opened, and Ralph Bertrand entered the room. "May I not join your circle, young ladies," he asked, as he came towards them. "It is bitterly cold out to-night, and your grate, with its warm, bright bed of coals, looks remarkably cheerful and attrac- tive." "We count as nothing; of course, Cousin Ralph," Ellen said, as she made room for him. "But our circle, like the street-cars, will always hold one more; so I suppose we will have to pardon your impertinence in even suggesting that the grate is more attractive than either Clyde or myself. We will take into con- sideration that 'it is bitterly cold out to-night;' so, get yourself a chair, and come and warm yourself; and then make yourself agreeable." "She is in a quarrelsome mood to-night, Bertrand,"  Clarke said; "she threatened me, the very moment  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7632-00000082"/> 168     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. I came in, with a scolding, and not content with that, has now attacked you." ' I have, something for her which I hope will put her in a good humor," Bertrand said. "But, finding you here, Henderson, I fear I am rather late with my- offering; for I did not know till this afternoon that 'Under a Cloud' was out, and then I bought a copy, which I brought with me." ' Clarke sent us a copy yesterday," Ellen said, as her cousin laid the book on her lap; " but yours is none the less welcome, for neither Clyde nor I could agree as to its ownership, and this will settle the ques- tion in the most satisfactory manner." "Then you have read it, of course?" "Of course I have. Now for your scolding, Clarke; you thought, I suppose, that I had forgotten it; but, as you see, it was only delayed.' "Suppose that you begin it, then, and have it over," he said, jestingly. "Come, Ellen, make haste, and then remember that I am rather anxious to know what you think of my book." You are indebted to it for the scolding. Clarke, tears are not becoming, they make one's eyes red, and swell one's nose and face; and yet I shed&amp; a good many over your story, and so did Clyde. You had no busi- ness to make it end so very, very sadly." He got up and made her a low bow. "I am per- fectly satisfied, Ellen; you could not have paid me a greater compliment." "But why did n't you make it end well, while you   CLYDE WARDLEIGaI.       169 were about it, Clarke? One only reads novels for amusement: and I can't afford to waste my valuable sympathy upon fictitious sorrows." "She likes everything to end as it does in the old fairy-tales," Clyde said. "How is it, Nell? 'And they were married, and lived happily ever afterwards' - that, I believe, is the usual finale." "The finale Ellen would prefer, under present cir- cumstances," Ralph Bertrand said, teasingly, to his cousin. "A nd what has Miss Wardleigh to say?" It was the question Clarke had been-waiting to ask. "Ellen and I did not agree," Clyde said. "I liked your ending, Clarke; a happier one would have spoiled' the book." "It was the only ending which seemed possible," Clarke replied. "And yet, after all the darkness, a little sunshine at the end might not have been inap- propriate." '"Some lives hold no sunshine, but are lived in shade," Ralph said. "I have not, of course, read your book yet, Henderson, though I intend reading it, and therefore. cannot express an opinion; but you seem to have satisfied Miss Wardleigh." "Clyde would not listen to me when I said that the last chapter spoiled the story," Ellen said. "No; because everything in Alice's life foreshad- owed its ending," Clyde said. "One thing led to another, until it seemed as though death were the only happy close to such a story." "Did you recognize your portrait,-Clyde? Clarke 15 !  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7632-00000083"/> 170     CLYDE WARDLEIGH.. asked. "You did not know that you sat for my heroine, did you?" "There, Clyde; I told you it was like you!"Ellen exclaimed. "Only here and there, though; just a word, a touch, a shade of resemblance; but she laughed at me for saying so." I said Clarke had stolen my name, Ellen; nothing more." "Your name, Miss Wardleigh? Surely you are always called 'Clyde?'"Ralph Bertrand said, in some surprise. ' My full name is Alice Clyde," was the quiet reply. "I wonder you have dropped the ' Alice,'" he said; and his voice lingered, almost lovingly, upon the soft syllables. Ellen noticed it. "You speak the name as if you loved it, cousin Ralph. Does it belong to any special friend?" "It was my mother's name, Ellen," he said, quietly, "and, being hers, is sweeter to me than any other name I know of," and then there was a brief silence in the talk. It was broken by Clyde, who wisled to remove the feeling Bertrand's words had caused. "Clarke, did I tell y6u of Ellen's atrocious pun on my name? Why is Miss Wardleigh like an icicle? Don't gratify her by guessing it, but let me tell you- because she is all ice!" It had the desired effect in producing a laugh. Then Clarke spoke.   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         171 "Clyde, I hope you are not displeased with me for putting you into my story?" Why should I be displeased, Clarke?" with a slight smile curving her lips. "You have made your Alice a very lovely character, so that I ought to con- sider it a compliment, if resemblance there be; but I hope no one save yourself will discover it." "I hope Clyde's life may end more happily than that of your Alice, Clarke)"Ellen observed. And yet it was the happiest ending for such a life," Clyde said thoughtfully; " the end which, sooner or later, comes to each of us - and indeed I think that, were I placed in the same, or in similar circumstances, I would far rather lie down at once in that peaceful rest and forgetfulness, than live to be crushed under the weight of such a burden as life may, and does sometimes prove-too heavy, almost, to be borne-and still harder with the fear of what may yet come being worse than has been sent. Death indeed would then be the truest blessing." "Whom the gods love, die young! Miss Clyde," Ralph quoted. "That, you know, was the old Roman creed. Is it your motto?" "It is the motto of Clarke's book," Clyde said more gaily than she had yet spoken. "Perhaps, after all, my theory is a very cowardly one; it really would be braver to be willing to meet fate thlan to wish to escape it - to bear troubles and misfortunes than to shun themr." "If the choice were left us, which it is not," Ralph  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7632-00000084"/> 172    CLYDE WARDLEIGH. observed, and-then Mr. and Mrs. Bertrand, and Mr. Haynes coming in, the talk became general. But lat6r, Ralph Bertrand heard Clarke and Clyde again discussing the old topic, and at last these words reached his ear, spoken by Clyde. "Did you think, in drawing your Alice, as you say, from me, Clarke, that I was threatened with misfor- tune? "I cannot think of misfortune and of you together, Clyde," was the reply. "Did it lie within my power, I would gladly keep even the shadow of a trouble from clouding your life!" Ralph Bertrand knew well enough what meaning lay hid in Clarke Henderson's tone. It almost pained him to hear it; and it was with a sudden thrill of jealous fear that he waited, almost as eagerly as Clarke himself, to hear Clyde's next words. They came, cheerfully spoken, with no apparent notice of Clarke's meaning; though whether that was intentional or not, Bertrand could not say. "Thanks for your kind wishes, Clarke. But I cannot expect to escape the usual fate. Only, if ever I am 'under a cloud,' I shall know where to find a true friend -- in you." She spoke with a slight, yet marked emphasis upon the word c" friend." Clyde forgot the words as soon as they had passed her lips--she did not know that to Ralph Bertrand they had been as a revelation- that in the sudden relief they brought to the anxiety with which he had listened for them, he had recog-   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        173 nized the fact that he, too, had yielded to Clyde's charm- that in her he had found his ideal - the very depths of his heart had been stirred, and that, with all the powers of his being, all the strength of his manhood - he loved Clyde Wardleigh! CHAPTER XV. "TLTI,'S WARNING. "I speatl to thee in Friendship's name." - MOORE. EEKS passed, and still Nora Reynolds lingered in New York. She wrote to her friends that she was having a very good time there, and had no ideawhen she should come home- not very soon, at any rate, though she would return in time for Lille Lewis's wedding; it would be no earlier. Almost every one has noticed that at times a sort of matrimonial epidemic seems to prevail among their friends. It is a sort of fever which, as the saying runs, is very catching; and one wedding in a family, or in one of the numerous little cliques into which society is divided, is generally the precursor of many others. It had been the case in Nora's circle of acquaintances this season; but1 no engagement had caused more talk and discussion than that of Lille Lewis and William Lloyd. 15 *  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7632-00000085"/> 174     CLYDE WARDLEIG ,H Lille heard the talk--there always is some one to repeat it- and laughed at it. She knew well enough that Me. Lloyd had for several years been considered one of the great prizes in the matrimonial market; and that more caps had been set for him, to use the vulgar but expressive phrase, by designing mothers and ambitious daughters, than for any one else in the city. Lloyd's wealth had done everything for him. He had a vast amount of conceit - more than gener- ally falls to the share of most men, conceited though the so-called nobler sex generally are; his one subject of conversation was himself-he had a vast stock of anecdotes and adventures, of which he was the hero, and which he had told over, and over, and over again, until his male companions knew them all by heart, and considered Lloyd and his stories a bore; and yet there was no man more sought after, courted, or flat- tered than he. His heavy purse and immense prop- erty so effectually gilded and beautified him, that he might have done exactly as he pleased, and chosen whom he would as his wife, with no fear of a refusal. But William Lloyd was no fool; if he was conceited, he knew well enough that his position and his wealth were the chief, if not'the only attractions in the eyes of the pretty girls and handsome women who smiled upon him; and the consequence was that while he had flirted with, and paid compliments to, nearly every lady of his acquaintance, not one of them could say, no matter how much they might have wisled it and plotted for it, that he had ever meant anything more than a flirtation.    CLYDE WARDLEIG H.        175 And to think that after all these efforts Lille Lewis should have carried off the prize! Lille, who had  laughed at him, and made fun of him-though in truth she laughed at every body, sparing none, though was all done good-naturedly--who had never made the least effort to please him,--they did not know that in those words the secret of it all lay. Lille was wise; she had said, over and over again, that girls were foolish to run after men, that they preferred doing the courting themselves, and that William Lloyd had been flattered, until flattery had lost its power, and a little indifference would probably have more effect. To do Lille justice, the thought of winning Mr. Lloyd herself had never entered her mind, and it took her completely by surprise, when one day he pl:ced him- self and his fortune at her disposal. She did not know that the mere fact of her making no difference. in her manner to him and to others had been his first reason for seeking her; he was tired of the many efforts made to secure him; and so, meeting with one girl who could be perfectly natural when with him, was in itself an attraction. Lille's words, spoken in jest, had proved truth in earnest. She had hesitated, too, about accepting him, for she knew well enourgl that she was not in love with him; but it had at last ended in an engagement. Lille's life hitherto had been no easy one,-that of elder sister in a large family seldom is,- and when a path free from care lay open before her, it is not very sur- prising that she should choose to walk in it. Her  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7632-00000086"/> 176-    CLYDE WARDLEIGH. father had married a second time. Percy and Lille were mere children when their mother died, and the present Mrs. Lewis had never fully taken her place with them. She had a large family herself--her children came rapidly--and Dr. Lewis's income, though good, had many demands upon it, and Lille knew that her step-mother would not be sorry to see her marry; in fact, she was not sparing of her hints that her own daughters were fast growing up. Her father would miss her but little,-his wife's uncertain temper had long since driven him to take refuge in his office in his few leisure moments; she could help Percy; she would escape from a home which was a home only in name, and where she was anything but happy; and so Lille pledged herself to Mr. Lloyd. She told him the whole truth, however; she told him of the uncongenial home she desired to leave; of the many petty trials which every day brought, and which are so hard to bear, so wearing to one's temper. She left it to him to recall, if he chose, his proposal; telling him that she would think none the less of him if, after this, he declined marrying her, although, if she became his wife, she would try to make him happy, and to do her duty. Lille Lewis was too truthful a girl to tell any man she loved him when she did not -it was best, she thought, that Mr. Lloyd should know the truth at once - he had as much at stake, and was as much interested as she was, and so she spoke. She lost nothing by it, either. It proved, to her own   CLYDE WAlIDLEIGH-.        1" surprise, the very best thing she could possibly have done. Her reply, frankly spoken, had, it is true, as- tonished Mr. Lloyd at first, and it certainly was not flattering to his vanity. But a momnent's reflection convinced him that any woman who would tell the truth, though it were to her own disadvantage, when it could easily be concealed, was well worth the win- ning; he felt gratified at the confidence Lille had placed in him, for she never had allowed any one to guess at the discomfort in which she lived at home; and instead of withdrawing his proposal, he renewed it more earn- estly than ever. No one knew all this, however, with the exception of Clyde Wardleigh; she and Lille were friends, in every sense of the word. Perhaps the fact that both were motherless had first drawn them together, but with the exception of Ellen Bertrand, there was no one to whom Clyde was more attached than she was to Lille Lewis. She had felt many misgivings when Lille had first confided the fact of her engagement to her, and yet she scarcely wondered at it. She knew only too well what the life was that Lille led, bravely tlough she concealed it from the world; she knew that ax William Lloyd's wife her chances of happiness would be far gireater than if she remained at home; but she watched her friend carefully as the time for her marriage drew near. "I begin to think that, after all, you have chosen wisely," she said one day. "Lille, I must say that at first I greatly disliked this engagement of yours; I M  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7632-00000087"/> 178     CLYDE WA IDLEIGH. believe now that it will turn out as well, if not better, than most of them do." "I could not find any one who would be kinder to me," Lille said, " and it is certainly very pleasant to feel one's self of importance to somebody. Even Mrs. Lewis seems to think that the future Mrs. Lloyd is a person worth conciliating." The last words came bitterly; Clyde made no reply, and Lille went on: "I shall not be sorry, except on father's account, when the fourteenth of April comes." "The fourteenth!"Clyde repeated; " so the day is fixed at last." "As well then as at any other time," Lille said. "And it is to be a, full dress evening wedding, too; which, as you know, Clyde, is my especial aversion. However, Mr. Lloyd prefers it, Mrs. Lewis urges it, -and so I'm going to be obliging, and sacrifice my own wishes with all possible grace." "Are you all ready?" So far as I know," Lille replied. "I had no very extensive preparations to make, Clyde; there are too many demands upon father's purse for me to be willing to ask for anything I could help; he will give me the wedding, and a little legacy left me by the aunt for whom I am  named supplied me with everything I really needed." And your bridesmaids?" "You first, of course, as you know -that was settled long ago, Clyde, in our school-girl days. Don't you   CLYDE WARDLEIGEI.        179 remember that the first one married was to call upon the other to accompany her to the altar; you used to say, even then, that you never would marry, but that is only ' talk'; -Ellen, Miss Lloyd, and Mary Hosmer." "And Nora Reynolds? you have forgotten her, Lille." "No, I had( not; but Nora declines serving." Clyde looked up in astonishment. "Why?" "Why?  I cannot pretend to account for any of Nora's whims and oddities, Clyde; she has not-seen fit to give me her reason." "Nora could scarcely be so impolite," Clyde began. "She was very polite," Lille laughed. "She wrote me a charming little letter, -you know that Nora rather prides herself upon her ability to write grace- fully, - congratulating me in the prettiest manner possible, and accompanying her note with a handsome present in silver. She says that she is very, very sorry that she must decline; wants to know who our attendants are to be; says she will surely be here -to see the knot tied; and assures me that the only thing that prevents her forming one of the party who are to assemble, oil the evening of April fourteenth, at the chancel-rail of St. Mark's, is the recollection of the old proverb, - now don't laugh, Clyde,-' Thrice a bride's maid, ne'er a bride, as this would be-not 'the third time of asking,' but the third time of standing." "Lille, you don't say Nora gave that as an excuse?  "I do most positively and emphatically.  It is  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7632-00000088"/> ;180 '    CLYDE WARDLEIGH. not her true reason, that is very certain; catch Nora Reynolds ever giving her true reasons for anything she does; though what she is after now, I can't imagine." "You are suspicious, Lille." "I have known Nora all my life, Clyde,- how cal I help it? Shall I tell you what I think lies at the very bottom of it all? By the way, you and Mr. Ber- trand are to stand together,- I hope you, at least, will be satisfied; Ellen, with Clarke Henderson; and my own private opinion of the matter is, that Nora would like to stand with Clarke herself." "Lille, excuse me, but is not that nonsense?" "Not a bit of it, Clyde; I can tell you honestly that if ever anybody was in love, Nora Reynolds is, with her cousin. Don't shake your head, or look so very incredulous; she would give her very eyes to get him, and I hope sincerely that she won't." "I cannot help thinking you are mistaken, Lille," Clyde said, quietly; " but even if you are right, Nora is scarcely likely to win Clarke, for I don't believe that the thought of marrying her has ever entered his mind." "And I hope it never will; I wish him better luck, Clyde. I don't trust Nora; she never was a very great favorite of mine,-she always was too designing for me. Even in our schooldays, if there was a straight and a crooked way of getting at anything, Nora was always sure to take the crooked way, - she's just like a soft, sleek, artful pussy-cat."   CLYDE WARDLEIaH.         181 "You are very severe, Lille." "Perhaps I am, but. then one can't help seeing or thinking, Clyde; and if ever, by any chance, you should happen to come into Nora Reynolds' way, or to inter- fere with any of her plans, why I will not answer for the consequences. Remember this, Clyde, and then I 11 be able to say, ' I told you so.' By the way, I've just read Clarke's book; what a very decided success it has been; I liked it." "I am very glad, for his sake, that it has been so successful," Clyde said. He is very much gratified, and with reason, at its receptidn. Your approaching wedding, Lille, and Clarke's book, are the two grand topics of conversation just now -people can talk of nothing else." What do they say about me?"Lille questioned. " Anything new and startling?  I do wish people would let me and my affairs alone; it seems such a very trifling matter, except to herself, whether Lille Lewis marries or not. But then people will talk; I do it myself, and so I suppose I must take it coolly. What do they say, Clyde? do they quote 'One of the very best matches ' and its sweet conclusion, about me?" "Scarcely," Clyde said, with a smile; "when you know as well as I do myself, how very much sought after Mr. Lloyd has been. It is not right in you to speak in that way- do you think it is?" , "Clyde! as if I was- in earnest. But, all jesting apart, 16  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7632-00000089"/> f82     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. I really wish that marriages could be settled quietly, without the world's knowing anything about them, and that this great turning-point in our lives could be passed in tranquillity." You cannot change human nature, however," was all that Clyde said. "I know; but wouldn't it be delightful if we could. More's the pity that it can't. I am no better than any one else, Clyde, but I do wish sometimes that people, myself included, might have a general setting to rights, and that it would do us all good; that we might con- sequently start fresh upon an entirely new leaf in the world's and our history." Clyde laughed. "You have a chance for that, Lille; you are leaving your old life behind you, and beginning a new one; your wedding-day will be a first-rate oppor- tunity for you to open your story at av leaf, aid I hope that you may always be able to look back to the fourteenth of April as the day, or rather the turning- point which led you into all possible happiness." There the talk ended. Clyde little thought that Lille's wedding-day would be a turning-point to her as well-pne of the few eventful days which come, now and then, into every life. Well for us that they are few in number; for, whether it be joy or sorrow that they bring, there is more of feeling, more of real living crowded into their brief hours than is sometimes found in years. Such days tell upon us, and mark them- selves, in lasting characters, upon the record of our lives l   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        183 CHAPTER XVI. COM PLICATIONS. "A mingled yarn, good and ill together." - SHAKESPEARE. MHE discovery which Ralph Bertrand had just made concerning himself was anything but an agreeable one. It was something for which he was totally un- prepared, which was wholly unexpected, which had never entered into his calculations. It was a thing which cauld give him no pleasure, either for the pres- ent or in the future. It placed him in a most awkward position-engaged to one woman, in love with another; it plunged him at once into that great fight in which, sometime or other, we all must bear our part,- the -struggle between right and wrong, duty and inclina- tion. -in his case, the battle between love and happiness , on the one side, agaiLst duty and honor on the other- his-duty to Nora; his love for Clyde. Following the example of our first father, - an ex- amplle which his sons, in all ages of the world, have not been slow to follow,- Bertrand's first impulse was to lay the blame upon the two women who had been; the one passively, the other actively, agents in bring- ing about this state of affairs. He never thought of blaming himself. He wondered wlhy it was tlat Clyde Wardleighi had chosen to love him, as if we can regu- late such mlatters as we will,--pity that we cannot,  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7632-00000090"/> 184     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. there would then be fewer imprudent, hasty, unhappy marriages. He said to himself that unless she had first loved him, he never would have thought of loving her. That was his first thought; later he felt its injustice, and then he was indignant with himself for the momen- tary censure passed upon the girl who, as he was well aware, had never, in one solitary action, been anything but what was gentle, maidenly, and delicate; who, he confessed to himself, was, and always would be, his ideal of perfect womanhood, standing, in his thoughts, if such a thing were possible, even higher than the sacred memory of his mother - a memory to which he clung witl such affectionate reverence. And, struck with a sudden remorse, he murmured to himself, "My darling, my darling, what am I that I should blame you? as if you could help your sweetness, your loveli- ness; and yet, to think that I never can call you mine." But if Clyde were blameless, how was it with Nora? Nora, who had so fully trusted him as to pledge her- self to him; Nora, who wap so bright, pretty, and be- witching, -who, content with her one warning, had never for a moment objected to his visits at his uncle's. And yet he could not help thinking that she was, per- haps, in part responsible for all this. Looking back now, he could see that over and over again, while warning him, playfully, to be sure, to be on his guard against Clyde Wardleigh's many attractions, and against fall- ing in love with her, she had yet contrived to throw them constantly together. It had been done so skil- fully, that at the time he had never suspected her agency   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         185 in it. He wished now that she could have treated him differently; perhaps had she acted towards him as most girls do to their lovers, he never would have thought of comparing her with Clyde,-better far if he had not;- for he now knew that Nora was nothing to him; that his feeling for her had never been more than a mere passing fancy, while Clyde was everything; his love for her, one tihat would last: and he knew that, bright, beautiful, and bewitching though Nora was, in Clyde's presence she was wholly forgotten that one shy glance from those soft violet eyes, one smile from those sweet lips, was of more worth to him thqn all that Nora could say or do for him; that the bonds by which she held him, lightly worn hitherto, had suddenly become a galling chain, from which he would have given worlds to be free! But how could he speak this? in what words could he tell Nora that he loved another? For the first time he realized, as few men can or do, what a woman's feelings must be when she learns that she loves, and that her own delicacy makes her conceal it, while the customs of society bid, nay, compel her to be silent. By his own sufferings, for they are sufferings while they last, though the press and hlurry and rush of busi- ness life make love to man a mere episode in his life, soon over, and sooner forgotten, -by his own present' suffering he learned fully to feel for and sympathize with Clyde. Compelled, as they were, to stand apart; she, knowing that she loved him, he, conscious of this love, valuing and returning it, and yet pledged to 16*  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7632-00000091"/> 186     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. another, and that other, one who would not release him, who never suspected him, or dreamed, herself, of disloyalty, Ralph Bertrand fought with himself, and came oft, for the time, conqueror. He felt too guilty himself to feel he had much right to blame Nora. He determined to hide his knowledge in his own- breast, and limit its consequences to himself. He had no right, if Nora loved him, to bring this trial upon her, to whom he was, in all honor, pledged. He could not confess his love to Clyde, kuowing, as he did, that it would be a useless avowal, even though it might not be unwelcome to her. But of what avail would it be to make this confession, except to raise a spirit which could never again be laid? It could -do no good-it might do harm; and so Ralph Bertrand resolved to be silent. Speech from him would be dis- honorable alike to Nora and to Clyde. Yet, at times, the longing to go to Clyde, to open his whole heart to her, to give her his confidence and to win her sympathy, grew almost too strong for him- to resist. It seemed to him that if only he could say to her, in the simplest, yet most expressive words, "I love you, Clyde;" could clasp her just once to his heart; could hear her low voice - he knew how sweet the words would be from her lips -repeat that one brief sentence to him that he would ask for nothing more. And yet he knew that even this would not content him; it was a terrible temptation, but lie :bravely put it aside; he would not allow himself to think of it, or expose himself to it. He even, hard as   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        187 it was, gave up going so often to his uncle's, except at times when he thought Clyde would be out; an easy thing to do, knowing, as he did, which of the Lenten services the girls attended. He could not wholly cease his visits, for that would be too marked. He was to marry Nora Reynolds-that was a fixed fact; and he deter- mined that just as soon as she returned home he would urge an early marriage upon her-it might as well be done quickly, if at all-and he hoped that they would live together as happily as most couples. The living reality of Nora's presence in his home might, in time, make him forget the sweet dream of his love for Clyde. While Ralpl Bertrand was thus bravely struggling with his own feelings, Clarke Henderson was perhaps happier than he ever had been before. Lille Lewis was right when she called his book a success, for it most decidedly was, and it would have been strange had Clarke not felt gratified. Few of us but are fond of approbation, no matter how we win it; and no praise that we can win is more prized- or valued than that bestowed upon a successful writer. One's work becomes so much and so completely a part of one's self, that only a writer can understand the enjoyment that a full appreciation, by others, of what has been done, gives you; and Clarke enjoyed his laurels to the full. he had labored for them, and enjoyed them. Yet to him it was only a means to an end. His highest ambition was to win Clyde,-he chiefly prized and sought after literary fame because he thought that it might male him more worthy of her, and in part  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7632-00000092"/> CLYDE WARDLEIGH. influence her to love him. As if women who love ever wait to think if the man of their choice be known to the world or not; it is enough to them that they love him; they love because they love, never caring what the opinion of the world may be -he is worthy in their eyes, and they care not how unworthy he may seem or be in the eyes of others, if only they have his good opinion. In this, Clarke had a truly womanly feeling. He thought Clyde so much better than him- self that he felt unworthy of her-he regarded her with a sort of reverence impossible to describe. Without Clyde, Clarke would never have had perseverance enough to make him what he was; all he accomplished was done with the hope of winning her as his final re- ward. And yet, this strange feeling of reverence had hitherto partially sealed his lips; he had never, in so many words, asked Clyde to be his wife, though he had never made any secret of his love for her-he was glad to think she knew it, for he hoped that this knowledge might prepare her to look favorably upon him. But it was perhaps a pity that he had not loved Nora instead of Clyde. Then, all of Nora's best qual- ities would have been brought into full play; her am- bitious, energetic disposition would have supplied the constant spur and incentive that Clarke's indolence needed, and her love for him would have taught her to be unselfish. Perhaps it is not surprising that the thought of love for his cousin had never occurred to him; persons brought up in the same house are thrown    CLYDE WARDLEIGHI.      189   too closely and constantly into contact, and are too much like brother and sister, for the airy glamour of love to fall upon them: and then as a rule men do not like ambitious women, or those who are able to think and act for themselves. They admire them, but they do not love them. They seem to consider it a sort 'of encroachment upon their own lordly prerogative,-they would like to see the hackneyed simile of the lordly oak and the clinging ivy carried out in all cases ; they want, so they say, to give and not receive support; though, Heaven knows, they prove often enough but a failing prop, a poor stay! And no one could ac- cuse Clyde of independence, for her's was one of those gentle, clinging natures which are so very attractive to men; and yet, underlying all this gentleness there was a stability of character, a certain firmness which only needed the help of circumstances to be called forth, and which would give her strength to persist in any course of conduct she might consider right. She herself could not understand just now why it was that she saw so little of Ralph Bertrand. She was unconscious of having offended him; she knew, of course, that he still came to the house, but she seldom, if ever, saw him; and on the rare occasions when they did meet, he spoke to her, it is true, but only when compelled, and then there was wanting the old friendly freedom which had been so pleasant. Clyde wondered what she could have done to cause this; but she would not ask,-that, her pride forbade: and then, too, there came the bitter thought that perhaps he had &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7632-00000093"/> 190    .CLYDE WARDLEIGH. learned the secret she had striven so hard to conceal, and was adopting this course so as to prove to her how useless her love Was to him, to show her his complete indifference. And, thinking this, she too avoided him, little dreaming how completely she misappre- hended his motives. So matters stood with these three when William Lloyd asked Clarke Henderson and Ralph Bertrand to stand with him. He little thought that by this simple request he was preparing a complication of events which finally ended in a manner totally unex- pected to the actors in them,--he little thought how it would influence three lives. Ralph Bertrand would gladly have declined stand- ing with Clyde had such a thing, been possible. He knew into what very close contact it would throw them; he knew how pleasant that would be to him; but he knew, too, what the temptation would be. But he could not refuse. How he envied Clarke, who did not hesitate to say he " only wished he was to be first groomsman!"  He envied him because he knew his lips were not sealed he might try to win Clyde- and such a jealous thrill passed through Bertrand's whole frame at the thought; while he, he who loved her, too, must stand aside, and see others try to win the prize he would have given worlds to call his own. Clyde herself would have declined, but that, she knew, was simply out of the question. She had no valid ex- cuse to offer, and Lille would have been deeply hurt had her most valued friend refused this to her. Per- l   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         191 haps, had Nora accepted, Clyde would have asked Lille' to excuse her; but Nora's note had evidently disappointed the bride-elect, and so Clyde quietly put her own feelings aside, and began her preparations. Not very willingly, it must be confessed she shrank from it with that indefinable presentiment of coming evil that all of us, at times, have felt, and yet which rarely brings fulfilment. Had Clyde been supersti- tious, she would have looked upon this feeling as an evil omen; but in this enlightened nineteenth century of ours, we do not believe in such things, and so she tried to forget it. As though to help the game of cross purposes which all were unconsciously playing, Nora Reynolds came home the day before Lille's wedding, and, wishing to surprise her friends, as she said, bade Clarke say nothing of her return. She wished to astonish them, she told him, and he was willing to oblige her. She did not even send Ralph Bertrand word that she had come home; why, she scarcely knew herself. Clarke knew that Nora delighted in little mysteries, and he never gave the matter a second thought. -For his own part, he was very glad that she had returned, he had missed her greatly; and the two cousins sat so long talking together, while Clarke smoked his after dinner cigar, that he was the very last to arrive at Lewis's, where the bridal party met, in order to arrange and rehearse their positions, -and make the final arrangements for the ceremony which was to take place the ensuing evening.  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7632-00000094"/> 192     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. CHAPTER XVII. THE FOURTEENTH OF APRIL. "Alas how easily things go wrong! A sigh too much, or a kiss too long, And there follows a mist and a weeping rain; And life is never the same again." TILLE LEWIS'S wedding-day came, as such days will come, at last. It had been dreaded by some, anxiously anticipated by others, and here it was. April weather has passed into a proverb for its "uncertain glories" and its changeable sky, but on this day the fickle month was pleased to show herself fair, serene, and balmy as her sweet sister June. She drew no misty veil of clouds over the clear blue of her sky; her sun shone brightly from his rising to his setting; and a few early flowers came forth, opening their petals in response to his warm kisses. Bird-songs were carolled forth by a few feathered songsters, and their glad greeting to the coming spring wgs only hushed by Tthe soft twilight in which the calm, bright day found its ending, to be followed by the still beauty of a night crowned with the radiance of the waning Easter moon, and glorious with the light of a thousand stars. A fair promise for her future life, a gem of a bridal day, Lille thought; and surely had she been allowed to select the weather, she could not have asked for any more favorable than this, which April, in her most winsome mood, had seen fit to give her.   CLYDE .WARDLEIGH.        193 It was yet early when Ralph Bertrand entered his uncle's house that evening. The ceremony was to take place at half-past eight, and he and Clarke had made arrangements to mieet at the Bertrands, where the car- riage would be in readiness for them. He was some- what surprised, on entering the library, not to find Clarke there, for the room was vacant; but upon con- sulting his watch, he found that, in his wish to be punctual, he had come nearly three quarters of an hour too early, and that he had nothing to do except to wait, as patiently as he could, for that length of time. He was sufficiently at home there to feel at liberty to make himself comfortable; and so, drawing an easy- chair to the table, he proceeded to ensconce himself therein, and to look over the numerous papers and magazines which lay upon the table. He did not find this occupation very satisfactory, as it would seem; for, as it happened, he had already seeni all of them, and so, man-like, he began to turn over all the other arti- cles lying within his reach. Equally unsatisfactory; so he got up, pushed his chair away, and began to wan- der around the library. The room bore many tokens alike of feminine and of masculine occupation. Ellen's work-box stood in close proximity to her father's cigar-stand; a handsome meerschaum, rapidly approaching the desired rich shade of brown, with its accompanying silver tobacco-box, lay on the mantel; a beautiful Maltese cat shared the rug before the grate with a handsome pointer, who wagged his tail lazily without getting up, in response to Ber- 17        N  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7632-00000095"/> 194     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. trand's caressing pull at his soft, silky brown ears; Clyde's guitar, with its blue ribbon, lay on one of the sofas, as though its owner had but just placed it there; Ellen's piano stood open, and, familiar though he was with the room, it was so long since he had been, in it in the evening,--long, if we count by feelings, short, if we number by days,- that the sweet homeliness, if the word may so be used, the place always possessed, came over him with even a stronger force than ever, and seemed to lend everything a new charm. He walked restlessly up and down the room, till at last his eyes fell upon a fan, a handkerchief, and a pair of white gloves, which lay upon a small table. With the curiosity men so often feel about the little belongings of a woman, he picked them up, rather laughing at himself for so doing; but a moment later, and he knew their owner. It did not need the A. C. W. embroidered upon the handkerchief to tell him whose they were; the faint, delicate odor clinging to them, the perfume of heliotrope which Clyde always loved and used, until it seemed almost a part of her, was enough. Clyde's partiality, not only for the scent, but for the flower, was well known; so well known, in fact, that every bouquet sent her -and such floral offerings, the most graceful and appropriate tribute that can be given a lady, came frequently- was fra- grant with the modest purple clusters of the flower she loved. Certain things seem always to be associated with certain persons; and the vanilla-like perfume of heliotrope lingering about these little articles, telling,   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         9 as it plainly did, that they belonged to Clyde, brought her into Ralph Bertrand's thoughts, and changed the listless curiosity with which he had first handled the pretty trifles into a sort of tender reverence, such as we  feel sometimes in touching things which have been used by those trow dead, whom we have loved when living. Those little white gloves now shared, as it were, Clyde's personality; itwas her hand whose shape they bore; and, moved by a sudden impulse, he pressed them passion- ately to his lips. A light step in the hall made him start, he dropped the gloves, and, half ashamed of his momentary emotion, so different from his usual calm self-control, he threw himself again into his chair, and, calling the dog to him, sat still, playing with Carlo, whose brown head rested contentedly upon his knee. Presently, however, the dog sprang away from him, and bounded to the door, as though to meet some one who hadJii ft-entered. There was the light rustle of a woman's flowing dress, a faint odor of heliotrope, and the next moment Clyde was standing near him. As Ralph Bertrand rose to meet her, he thought he never had seen a fairer vision of female loveliness, and won- dered how he ever could have thought her ailything but beautiful. Her dress was of soft white illusion, falling in fleecy folds over rich, sheeny, white satin, with not a particle of color to fleck its purity. The delicate fabric veiled, without concealing, the beautiful arms and neck, which, in their rounded, dimpled whiteness, might have served as models for the sculptor's art. Clyde never indulged in  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7632-00000096"/> :190    CLYDE WARDLEIGH. the undress, misnamed full-dress, prescribed by fashion, but to which her ideas of propriety, out of date though they may be thought, could never reconcile themselves; and although some women seem to consider a scanty dress necessary for evening costumes, there are few men who do not consider a little less economical use of material not only more becoming, but more attractive and desirable. Her beautiful waving hair needed no ornament save its own luxuriance. Not even a flower nestled among its bright masses and glistening curls. The lace at her throat was confined with a tiny cluster of pearls, but with that exception she wore no orna- ments. It was a costume which, in its total absence of color, would have been trying to most persons, but to Clyde it was singularly becoming,- it suited her as no other dress would have done, and color would have spoiled its effect. "Iam sorry, indeed, that we did not know you were here," Clyde said, as she shook hands with the gentle- man. "You should have sent us word that you had come, instead of sitting here in solitary grandeur; un- less, indeed, you preferred your own and Carlo's com- pany." ' I had only myself to thank for my solitude," was the reply; "I had no idea that I was so unreasonably prompt. I could not, therefore, expect an early solu- tionito the mysteries of a lady's toilette; and neither Nell nor yourself would have thanked me for hurrying you, no matter what your politeness may have led you to-say."   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        197 "Do you know that you are paying us some very poor compliments, Mr. Bertrand?"Clyde asked, smilingly; "you are calling our good-nature, to say nothing of our politeness, into question, - and do you think that we consider Carlo an equivalent for our- selves?" "Carlo is a very nice dog in his way, but I would not dare to compare him to two young ladies." "Poor old Carlo! I really believe that he knows we are talking about him," Clyde said, as the dog came to her side. ' Poor old pet! he is very fond of me;" and Ralph Bertrand fairly envied the dog, because Clyde's white hand rested caressingly upon his head. Then there was a pause - Clyde wondered within herself why Ellen did not come down; for this interview was none of her seeking; she had expected to find the library unoccupied --but as this meeting had, as it were, been forced upon her, she would go through with it, and so she talled on, determined that there should be, could she prevent them, no awkward silences. It was the first time for weeks that the two had been together, alone; or had exchanged more than the most ordinary words of greeting which may pass between comparative strangers; and so, these two, 'so near, and yet so far' apart, were equally unconscious of each other's feelings and thoughts. In cases like this, how- ever, women have the advantage-even the best of them, through. long and continued practice, which is almost compulsory, after all, are such adepts in the art of concealment that it is very rarely one of the sex 17   &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7632-00000097"/> 198     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. betrays herself so far as to be taken at a disadvantage. The power is partly natural, partly acquired--one can scarcely tell where Nature ends and Art begins- and added to this is the all-powerfulV adjunct of a woman's pride, which comes to her aid on all occasions. It came to Clyde's assistance. Not for worlds would she have had Ralph Bertrand suspect that she felt the slightest embarrassment in his presence, or that she had noticed his avoidance of her;- to that she would make no reference, however distant - she would treat him exactly as she would have treated any other gentleman; she talked to him, as we often do, so as to fill up the time. But it was no easy matter for her to sit there and talk calmly, when all the time her heart was beating so fast and hard that she almost imagined she heard its pulsations. "Do you know that you have greatly neglected your duty, Mr. Bertrand?" "No very unfrequent thing for me to do," he said; "but in this case I really am at a loss to know what you can mean." "After all, it is nothing very serious, so you need not look so much alarmed; it is only that custom' requires you gentlemen to present us with our flowers, and it seems you have wholly forgotten it. Not a very important matter, to be sure; and it can be easily remedied if you will come into the conservatory with me, and assist me in making my bouquet." "There is not the slightest necessity for your taking that trouble," he said. "I did not forget your flowers,   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        199 Miss Clyde, but Henderson requested me to allow him to supply you upon this occasion. He said that he knew just exactly what you wanted; and as I pre- sumed it was a matter bf very little importance to you whence your flowers came, and he seemed so very anxious to provide them, I could do nothing less than give up to him." "It does not matter," Clyde said, carelessly, though she could not but think how much more she would Ihave prized one flower from his hand than a thousand from any one else. "Poor flowers! I always do feel v  so sorry for them at a ball! They fade and droop so soon-so much sooner than anywhere else! But this has been too lovely a day for me to talk of anything's fading or dying, though it be only flowers." "Miss Lewis has had a beautiful day for her wed- ding." "A perfect day--Lille is a 'sun-blessed bride,"' Clyde said. "If only her whole life, like this, could be sunshine! Dear Lille! I sincerely hope she may be happy!" "That will probably depend chiefly upon herself," was the reply. '(You women can make or mar your own happiness, as you choose; it all rests with you."; "I don't agree with you," Clyde said; " it seems to me that both parties are responsible, and happiness depends quite as much upon the one as upon the other; and if only each will try to do their duty, married life must be very happy." "Always?"  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7632-00000098"/> 200     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. "It always ought to be, I think. Take, for instance, my aunt and uncle as examples, Mr. Bertrand; their married life is a poem in itself." But are they not exceptional cases, Miss Clyde?" "I should be sorry to think so." "Then, can you realize people marrying without love?" "I can imagine nothing more miserable." "I see you believe in it," he said, "though I can scarcely wonder at you, with the examples of happy married life that you always have before you "--and in a lower tone, " it is a pity all of us could not be equally blessed." The conversation was touching dangerous ground, and Clyde felt it. She paused - she could think of no reply to make to this last remark. She rose from her chair and walked to the mantel. A strange shy- ness had suddenly come over her, and yet it was not exactly unpleasant --she wondered if her companion had noticed it--she looked around, but he seemed to feel the same restlessness that had come over her, and, apparently forgetful of her presence, he had risen from his seat and turned to the table. It was only an apparent forgetfulness, however, for the next moment t he had come to her side. Clyde raised her eyes to his, some light speech on her lips, but it was never spoken. The expression in the dark eyes looking into her own silenced her.-they were full of a deep, longing tender- ness she had never before seen in them - hers fell as she met them, but what Ralph Bertrand read in them   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        201 she did not know, only the next moment his arms were around her--he had drawn her, unresistingly, close, close to his heart, his lips sought and were pressed to hers in a long, loving kiss, and he whispered, in a tone low and tremulous with repressed emotion, these words: "Clyde, forgive me! I could not help it, my own darling! You will, you must forgive me; for what better excuse can I plead than this- that I love you!" She made no reply, she was too happy for that - but words were not needed; she only laid her head upon his shoulder, and he was satisfied with the mute assur- ance given by the action. But the joy of such moments, when heart speaks to heart, needing only the meeting of the lips to express all, and more than all that can be spoken, cannot be described. For perfect love is the very crown of life, the suprelmest of all joys, and such moments bring a bliss too exquisite to last. Only for a brief moment did Clyde rest in that close and tender embrace, but that brief moment seemed to her as though it held more of real happiness than all the preceding years of her life. It was only for a brief moment, and then she started from him, for a step was heard in the hall; Ellen and Clai'ke entered the room, and the lovers' brief Elysium was over. How the rest of that even- ing passed, Clyde never knew.  It was to her as though she walked in a dream, yet a dream of happi- ness so intense, that her only fear was that she might awake and find it unreal. She was glad that Clarke's entrance, and the beautiful flowers he  brought,  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7632-00000099"/> 202     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. prevented Ellen's noticing what she feared must be her too evident consciousness; she was glad to hide her blushing face by bending it over the lovely cluster of white camelias, scented heliotrope, mignonette, and Parma violets, which Clarke placed in her hand. Ellen's matched it, save that rich scarlet blooms, more brilliant but less fragrant, replaced the purple of her own; and Clyde was glad that the beauty of the flow- ers, engrossing, as it did, the attention of the party, gave them something to talk about. Thinking over the evening afterwards, she remembered little about it -her own heart-song of joy was all she heard. Through-the ceremony at the church she only knew that she leaned on Ralph Bertrand's arm; she cared only to know that he was near her. All through the evening she felt the warm pressure of his lips in that one long kiss they had left upon her own - that kiss which had not only told so much, but had sealed her as his, and pledged her love for life. For that brief interview had opened a new world to her--had taught her what it really was to live - had crowned that fair April day as a queen of days. Clyde little guessed that the happiness which she felt irradiated her whole countenance, was told in her whole bearing. She did not know that it lent a new charm to her sweet face, brought a faint flush to the pure cheek, a tender light to the soft violet eye, as though the bliss, hitherto unknown, which she now felt in the very depths of her heart, gave a new and winsome grace to every move- ment. She would have given much to be alone --to   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        203 live over, in thought, that too brief scene; but no, that must be deferred to a more convenient season. It was hard, that evening, to obey the claims of society; it seemed to Clyde that never before had she acquitted herself so badly. She did not know that low murmurs of admiration followed her every movement; but even had she known it, she only would have prized and valued it because she wished to be thought fair and lovely, and worthy of the admiration of one, and that one- Ralph Bertrand. Only one person among the many crowding Dr. Lewis's house that night understood the secret of Clyde's added beauty. Nora had gained her point - she had taken all of her friends by surprise-she had come home brighter and livelier than ever, and only one of all those who greeted and welcomed her home felt a pang of regret at meeting her, and that was the one person who shouldl most have rejoiced at it. Ralph Bertrand felt as though a sudden storm had burst over his head when Nora's black eyes rested inquiringly, searchingly, upon him as their hands met. All that he had done in a moment of forgetfulness, all that lay before him yet to do, flashed across his mind, for there was much meaning in Nora's tone when she spoke, trifling though her words were. -"I believe I have taken you by surprise, too?" "You certainly have, for I had no idea you were in town."  ' "I only returned yesterday; I would not have missed Lille's wedding for the world."  o  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7632-00000100"/> 204     CLYDE WAIRDLEIG H "You enjoyed your visit, I hope?  "Indeed I did; but it has not made me forgetful of my old friends. I shall be at home alone to-morrow evening,-cannot you find time to call?" and without waiting for an answer, she passed on. She knew well enough that she would see him at the'time she had appointed; and she had read Clyde's secret, well though it had been concealed from others. So far, her plan had worked to-perfection. It had removed Clarke and Clyde farther than ever apart - it only remained to be seen with what success the rest of it would be crowned. CHAPTER   XVIII. I LOVE YOU. "Oh, what a tangled web we weave, When first we practise to deceive I "--SCOTT. FEW who listened to Nora Reynolds' gay, careless talk, heard her merry laugh, or saw her evident enjoy- ment on the evening which changed Miss Lewis into Mrs. William Lloyd, would have believed it possible that so many plots and plans could be passing through the busy little brain of one who seemed only to think of the pleasures of the present. But Nora was a capital actress; she never said a word that was not thoroughly well considered; she was careful never to commit herself by speech or by action; she knew that   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         205. to gain her object she must keep her own counsel, and so, while she never for one moment relaxed her vigi- lance, and sawmuch in consequence, she was yet so gay and lively that her only thought seemed to be- enjoyment. But seldom in all her life had Nora Reynolds thought more earnestly or intently than she did after her return from the wedding reception. So far asshe could judge, the ganie now lay in her own hands; it only remained for her to decide which moves would be best calculated to bring' it to a conclusion. She had seen and discovered much that the, parties concerned thought was concealed from every one.- She knew, as well as though they had told her, that Clyde Ward- leigh and Ralph Bertrand loved one another; the first pleased, the second displeased her; she saw that Clarke, blinded by his own wishes, saw nothing of this; that, if possible, he cared more than ever for Clyde, and that it would be very hard to convince him that he had 'nochance of success. Without this conviction Nora knew that she never could min her cousin; and how to bring it to him, except by a refusal from Clyde, she scarcely knew. It would be no easy matter, -we are all so inclined td believe what we wish, that to convince any one against his or her will, is a very hard thing to do. Easily led and influenced though Clarke generally was,- in fact, he was too indolent, and it was really too much trouble for himever to oppose any one or anytlingg very strenu- ously, when yielding was so much easier, -he could yet 18  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7632-00000101"/> 206     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. be at times very obstinate and determined. Nora knew that she had some influence over Clarke - not so much as Clyde, had she chosen to use it, but it was the influence of affection, and not of love. There was but little sleep for Nora that night. She must decide, and at once, upon the best course of con- duct for her to pursue. She knew that some explana- tion between Ralph Bertrand and herself was necessary; it could not be avoided. She had played fast and loose with him long enough. She wondered if, after all, it might not be the best policy for her to release him, a step which, from what she had seen that evening, she thought would be at once followed by his engagement ,. to Clyde. For Nora had seen plainly enough that // these two loved one another, though she never sus- pected that a confession of it had passed their lips; it would be the simplest, surest, most natural way of bringing the bitter fruit of knowledge - for bitter she well knew it would be- to Clarke. It wouldl  obviate all further plot and plan; would secure her Bertrand's friendship; and, for the moment, Nora's better nature - we are none of us wholly bad, wholly selfish pleaded with her to obey its prompt- ings. But then the thouglitcame, that perhaps, after all this, she might be left alone, and Clarke, never knowing what she had done for his sake, might seek consolation elsewhere, for his ample fortune and grow- ing literary fame would give him broad latitude of choice. And then the old feeling of jealous dislike of Clyde rose up, anid prompted the question why the   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         207 one should win all, and the other lose everything! And yet, could Nora have been sure of winning Clarke Henderson, she would not have cared had Clyde won her own happiness; she soothed her conscience by say- ing to herself, that as soon as her own point was gailed, Clyde was welcome to be happy; but she herself was unwilling to give up the position Ralph Bertrand could bestow upon her, as his wife, before she had secured what she considered its full equivalent, in Clarke's love. She knew that with Clyde, once to love would be to love forever; she knew that a proposal from Clarke would only mnet with a rejection. She wished to give Clyde a pang, and so she finally resolved, that, when she should see Ralph Bertrand on the morrow,  she would, wholly unsuspicious of what might have happened during her absence, permit him to announce their engagement, then urge Clarke to try his fortune with Clyde, and finally, be guided by circumstances. And by the time that she had reached this conclusion, Nora remembered, that, to win the battle, she would need to have all her wits about her, and that lying awake was the very best way to disperse them, to say nothing of its spoiling one's good looks; and so she composed herself; and was soon sleeping as soundly as though plots and plans and stratagems were as good opiates as a quiet conscience and a tranquil mind are generally considered. To Clyde it had been a night of blissful dreams, full of promises of future happiness. She had knelt to offer heartfelt thanks for this new blessing which had  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7632-00000102"/> 208     CLYDE WAnDLEIGH. come into her life, ere she sought her rest; his name had been often mentioned in those innocent prayers - 'he was the last conscious thought in her mind. It had been a blessed night, and Clyde said to herself gladly, as her sweet eyes opened to greet the new day, that the date which marked the beginning of Lille Lewis's new life opened a new volume for her own. If only all its coming pages might prove as bright as the first! Troubles might come--must come - they did in every life; but she would not think of them now; it was enough to her, a present sufficient bliss, to think that he loved her and was her own; and that if troubles came,-though she could scarcely believe it possible, in the joy of the present, that they could come, -they would meet and bear them together. Or, if they came, better that they should fall only upon herself; sparing him. There lay the difference between Clyde Wardleigh and Nora Reynolds.   The one thought and cared for others more than, and before herself; the other made self her first and only con- sideration. Yet Nora was a very attractive little person for a man to look upon and call his own. So Ralph Bertrand thought, when she came forward to meet him the morning after the wedding. Nora had guessed that he would not defer visiting her until evening, and conse- quently it was no surprise to her when he came. She showed no signs of weariness after the late hours she had kept the night before, and the intense thought she had given her plans had left no trace upon her appear-   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         209 ance; she was as fresh and bright as the fair April morning which, not many hours before, had dawned upon the earth. ,But, calm though she looked, she was not easy in her mind; she knew that a trying inter- view lay before her she read in Ralph Bertrand's face that he had passed a restless night, and she almost guessed on what errand he had come. Like Nora, he had spent hours in thought. 'But, unlike Nora, he was not at liberty to select his own course. His pledged word bound him, unless she chose to release him. Plighted to one woman--in love with another - it is not surprising that he fully realized the awkwardness of the situation in which he had involved himself. Nora not only shook hands with him, but she held up her lips to him as he entered. Never before had Nora freely and of her own accord offered her lover a kiss. She had been chary of such caresses; but there was meaning in her actions this morning. Bertrand could do no less than take the mutely offered caress;- few men, even the very best of them, will ever refuse a kiss from a pretty woman; and Nora's lips were sweet lips to kiss, soft, tender, and scarlet; but even while Ralph bent his tall figure to press them, though briefly, lightly, there was no love in that kiss; he remembered how, not later than the preceding evei- ing, other, sweeter, tenderer lips had shyly permitted his caress. Nora knew well enough what she was doing. The silent offering of that kiss said more for her than 18*        O         .  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7632-00000103"/> 210     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. words- it told Ralph Bertrand that she not only remembered, but fully acknowledged, his claims upon her; it told him that she thought him true to her; it made the task which lay before him doubly hard. ' You seemed very much surpried at seeing me last night," Nora said, as they seated themselves. "I certainly was. I knew that you had declined being bridesmaid, and supposed you would scarcely shorten your visit to come home for the wedding." Shorten my visit!" she repeated, laughing; "I was away five weeks! You are very complimentary indeed; when you call such an absence short! I don't believe 'that you are at all glad to see me again." "CanIot such things be understood without being expressed?" he asked. "C I did not expect you, because Mrs. Lloyd told me of your refusal." "Mrs. Lloyd! You have fallen into the new fashion rapidly!  "One soon becomes accustomed to new fashions and to changes," was the reply; " the sooner the better, too." "Not always," Nora said, quietly. "Some changes are anything but pleasant when they come." She was twirling a ring upon her finger as she spoke; it was the one he had given her as a pledge of their engage- ment. He saw the action, and took her hand. "Such as changing this for another?" he asked, pointedly. She looked down. "I have been thinking very seriously of our engagement, Nora." It was the opportunity she wanted, and she would not let it escape. w.   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        2" "So have I," she answered. "Ralph, you have urged me, over and over again, to allow it to be acknowledged, and I have always refused. I have thought over it very seriously, and have concluded that you were right, and the best way that I can prove it to you, I think, is to say to you that I am now willing to do what I ought to have done long ago, and that is, to trust to your better judgment, and allow you to select your own time for its announcement." It was said very prettily, and then Nora watched for the effect of her words. Bertrand started to his feet. ' Nora, are you in earnest?" "I never was more in earnest, I can assure you, though you take my words rather strangely, I must say." She had folded her hands and leaned lazily back in her chair as she spoke. Bertrand walked up and down the room once or twice, her eyes never once mioving from him. "What is the matter?" she asked at last. It is so hard to please you men; so long as anything is refused you, or is beyond your ireach, no effort is too great for you to make to attain it; let it be offered you, and you grow suddenly indifferent to it. Ralph, what am I to think of this?" "Think -what you please, Nora; whaf you please," stopping before her. "I have a confession to make to you, and I scarcely know how to begin it." "I hate confessions, and never make them myself," Nora said, playfully. "So I believe I will absolve: you beforehand, as I suppose you have been flirting a  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7632-00000104"/> 212     CLYDE WARDLETGH. little during my absence; but I cannot be too severe, for I believe I must plead guilty to doing the same thing. myself. I'm right, am I not? it can be mutual forgiveness, Ralph! Are you agreed? Her playful tone deceived him. into thinking her wholly unsuspicious. He never guessed that Nora knew exactly what it was he wished to say to her, and that she thoroughly enjoyed the situation, something as a cat enjoys playing with a mouse. It made it harder for him to speak. Ralph Bertrand would rather have cut off his right hand than say what he 'came to say to Nora; but he had no choice; the thing must be done. "Well, what have you been doing, Ralph?" she went on, seeing that he hesitated. "Is it anything in which I can help you?" "More than any one else, if you only will," he said, eagerly. "Nora, the whole thing rests with you, though what you will say to what I have to ask of you I do not know. You tell me that you are willing to have our engagement announced; it has hitherto been only a nominal one-a secret between ourselves; would it not be, is it not best for me to speak the truth plainly, and to tell you that I came here this morning for no other reason than to ask you to set me free -a release which I truly lelieve will be as acceptable to you as to myself." "For what reason? she asked, coldly. "I am not conscious of having in any way offended you. I am the same Nora Reynolds that I have always been  the same you once asked to become your wife. In -1   CLYDE   ARDLEIGH.      213 what way can I have offended you, Ralph; what have I done, that you bring me this reproach -how have I merited blame?" "I do not--I cannot blame you in the least degree," he said. "The blame and the reproach must all fall upon me, aid upon me alone. Nora, it is hard for me to say it, but it is due to you that it should be said; I am willing to bear any amount of reproach from you, but my only honorable course is to tell you the simple truth - that I love another." "A strange-- a very strange confession for my future husband to make to me," was Nora's reply; " and yet I dare not blame. you, Ralph, for your truant fancy, fearing, as I do, that I am partly responsible for it, through my thoughtless neglect of my duties towards you, and now I can only forgive you, and try to win you back. But," changing her tone, "who is the fair enchantress, Ralph? I have some natural curiosity to know; and does she return your fancy?" "I am only at liberty to speak of my own feelings, Nora," he answered. "You have a right to lknow this much, however; it is Clyde Wardleigh." "And I once warned you against her, too," she said, reproachfully. "Surely, you must remember, Ralph; and remember, too, that you told me my warning was thrown away." "I know that you once warned me," ie said, more quietly 'than he had before spoken. "But we need bring Miss Wardleigh no further into this discussion; it now rests between ourselves-rather, it all rests  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7632-00000105"/> 214     CLYDE WARDLEIGII. with you, now. Nora, I came here this morning to ask you to release me. I hoped it would be no pain to you to do it; I thought you would be pleased to regain your liberty. Nora, set me free, and if you care at all for my friendship, it will be yours forever; none will stand higher in my good opinion than your- self." "Have you thought --can it possibly have occurred to you, that I might not care to release you?"Nora asked. I can scarcely think that you would wish to hold me bound, after what I have said," he urged. "Nora, I speak as much for your sake as for my own, A loveless married life would be misery to both,; and you deserve a better fate than you would have were your life joined to mine." "But I ask no better, no happier fate, Ralph/, Nora replied. "I blame myself, and not you, for all this; let us both try to do better in future, and learn to forget it." Nora!" he exclaimed, "do I understand you rightly? My honor, it is true, pledges me to you; but will you, can you condemn three of us to what in truth would be life-long misery? Have you no regard for your own feelings? none for Clyde's? no thought for mine?" "I thought that Clyde was to be brought no further into this matter," she said, quietly. "Why should I consider her atall? she is nothing to me! No, Ralph, I can only think of you -of myself. I am selfish in   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        215 consulting my own wishes. I think of my own feel- ings; I cannot release you, because in so doing I would lose my only chance for happiness; because," she hesi- tated as she spoke, " because - I love you!" "You love me, Nora!" he slowly repeated, as though taken completely by surprise. "You love me, Nora! did I hear you rightly?  "Must I repeat it to convince you?" she said, with her sweetest smile, "yes, Ralph, I love you." "Then, indeed, I wonder that you are willing to forgive me, and -overlook this," he said, hoarsely. "It is useless for me to say more, I can only wish it all unsaid. My hand is yours, Nora; and my name, if you still wish them; my heart -" "Think of its wanderings only as an unpleasant dream," Nora's low voice gently murmured. "I was first wrong in the secrecy upon which I so foolishy insisted; there were faults on both sides; let us forget them and the past, and look only to the future." "Can you be satisfied to look forward to it?" he asked. "Nora, I have read somewheres, that true, real, sincere love, finds its greatest happiness in secur- ing the happiness of the one beloved, regardless of itself. I ought not - I should not ask any better gift than yourself, butt loving Clyde as I do, as I must, almost in spite of myself, until death, can you -dare you marry me, knowing what it may bring upon us both? It rests with you to decide, Nora; have you no fear as to the result?" "Once more," she said, "I can only repeat that I  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7632-00000106"/> i6J     CLY D  WADJJiLEIGH. love you. I have no fears for the future, with you. I can trust myself to you, without anxiety, and I hope that some day you will thank me for this decision." "Then, indeed, I have no choice but to bear my fate," he said, hoarsely; "I cannot, if you love me, blame you, Nora, for this refusal. I only hope that you may never regret it. Let our engagement be announced at once, and our marriage followit promptly; if the thing is to'be done, why, the sooner the better for us both. If you will have me, Nora, you may take me when you choose. Settle the matter as you please; I will agree to any arrangements you may see fit to make. You need not fear but that I shall be ready to fulfil my part of the contract." "I can trust you fully," was Nora's sole reply, and a moment later she was alone.  CHAPTER XIX. WHAT TWO ENDURED. "Alas, how hardly things go right! 'Tis hard to watch on a summer night, For the sigh will come, and the kiss will stay, And the summer night is a wintry day." CARCELY knowing what he did, Bertrand had left Nora Reynolds. He had sought her presence, hoping that she would release him from an engagement   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        217 which he had long felt was a mistake. A full expla- nation and confession of his motives was, he had thought, due to her, and, difficult though it had been for him, he had done his duty. But Nora had not chosen to release him; she had not looked upon the matter as seriously as he had done; she had claimed as due to her, the fulfilment'of his engagement, and, as he had said, he felt in consequence bound to fulfil his part of the contract. But his bitter disappointment told him how much he had really hoped. He wondered if duty always was so hard; he asked himself over and over if it could be that Nora really loved him, which he could not help doubting. But one thing was certain - he was to marry her, and that prospect, which some six months before had seemed so pleasant and desirable, was now a thing he fairly dreaded. He saw nothing -but misery for both in it. Nora's words, thrice repeated, had been, "I love you;" but to his ear they had not the ring of truth, and yet what right had he to think them false? He knew that the law holds a prisoner at the bar, accused of crime, innocent until his guilt be proved; not till then can the verdict be given and sentence pronounced. He was bound to believe in Nora's truth until she was convicted of falsehood. If she really loved him, he pitied her; he knew how poor a requital he could make; he had told her how little he had to give in return, but if she chose to take the risk, he had no other choice than to submit. If she 19  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7632-00000107"/> 21g     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. did not love him- but he dismissed that thought, as speedily as might be, from his mind. And then he thought of Clyde. He blamed him- self severely for his momentary loss of self-control, for the impulse of imprudent passion which had betrayed him. To an honorable man like Ralph Bertrand, the thought of what he had done was its own sufficient punishment. His own part he knew he could bear; a man's life holds so many interests, and is so fully. occupied, that such wounds, however deep, soon scar over and heal; a woman's life is blighted by them. He knew well that to Clyde nothing would ever be the same again; the sharpest sting, the bitterest pang in his own suffering lay in the thought that he had brought all this upon her. Hard as it had been for him to speak to Nora, he knew that what he had yet to do was harder still. He must see Clyde; must tell her what it really was that he had done; must' seek her forgiveness for his own thoughtlessness. He set his teeth close and drew his breath hard as he thought of this coming interview. Bertrand was a brave man, both physically and mor- ally, and the latter is the highest courage; but he shrank like a timid girl from this meeting with the woman he loved. How could he tell her that their love was forbidden; that he had no right even so much as to think of her. He so prized her good opinion; and now to think that it must be forfeited and lost. Such a sparkling cup of happiness as had been offered to their lips, and it had turned suddenly to bitterness.   .                   .&amp;   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        219 With his own hand he must crush the sweet hopes just bursting into bloom. No prisoner under sentence of death ever dreaded the coming of the day and hour of execution more than this man dreaded the speaking of the words which must part Clyde and himself forever. What would-she think of him?  Would it make her despise him? He had little respect for himself, just now; but he hoped Clyde would be kinder in her thoughts of him than he was to himself. He knew that this must be their last interview; hereafter, should they meet, it must be as strangers, for between them no friendship could exist; it must be all or nothing, and only in the latter course would there be safety for both. He spent the rest of that day in his office. He knew well enough that Clyde would expect him-- would look for him; but he could not resolve to go to her. He must summon all his courage;'he tried to prepare his words, to choose his language, but in vain; he could determine nothing. Clients came in -there were letters to be answered--business papers to be arranged; he attended to all, mechanically; they could not be neglected. A professional man cannot disre- gard the claims of his business. And Clyde that day had been happy beyonddescrip- tion. But it was a happiness which made her more quiet than was her wont - which made her feel as though she wished to be alone, to brood over it silently; to live over the scene of the evening before; and every word spoken to her seemed to break in upon her sweet dream. She had not yet spoken even to Ellen of this t o  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7632-00000108"/> 220     CLYDE WARDLEIG H. great new joy which had come into her life, though she knew how they all would rejoice with her; she pre- ferred that other lips than hers should tell the story; better told by him than by her; and yet she felt as though even this brief silence was unkind and unjust to those who had treated her and loved her as their own child. Waiting, as she did, all that day for her lover's coming, her thoughts wandered back to her past life. 'They lingered most tenderly upon the memory of the mother she had so fondly loved; they recalled to her the quiet life they had led together in the little vil- lage which was the scene where her early youth was spent; they brought back the sad, sweet face which so seldom smiled. The calmest look it had ever worn was that which the coffin-lid had at last hidden away from her gaze. She remembered how, despite her sad- ness, that mother had always interested herself in what interested her child i she longed to-day for her mother's tender sympathy as only those who have lost it can long for it; she thought of the last sdene in that life, and of the promise those dying lips had asked of her, and which she had given; a promise scarcely heeded until now-the promise that she would not marry before she was twenty-one;- a promise only required, Clyde thought, because, marrying herself at the early age of eighteen, Mrs. Wardleigh had learned what a mistake she herself had committed -Clyde knew her mother's married life had not been a happy one -and she wished to save her daughter from a similar fate.   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        221 At least, so Clyde had thought when she grew old enough to think upon the matter. She had given the promise at first, unconscious of, and caring nothing for what it implied, to soothe her mother's uneasiness. Until now, it never had weighed upon her; she had seldom, if ever, given it a thought. She scarcely knew"why she thought of it to-day, for it would only be binding upon her for a few weeks longer; she would  be twenty-one in June, and so she dismissed the thought of it, and only remembered how truly her lost mother would have sympathized with her child's present hap- piness. Poor child! She little guessed that her brief dream of happiness was to end almost as soon as it had begun; and to end, too, by the act of one she thought her friend. Every ring at the bell made her start that day with a joyful expectancy; every passing step thrilled her with tremulous hope. Was she wrong in judging him by herself; wrong in thinking he would eagerly seek her presence? She looked and waited for him all morning-all afternoon; and not for one moment did any suspicion of the truth cross her mind; so near do we come to the great realities and trials of life, and never guess what awaits us until the storm in all its fury- bursts upon our unprotected heads. And when at last, late in -the afternoon, word was'brought to her that Mr. Bertrand was in the draw- ing-room, and had asked for Miss Wardleigh, she went down to see him with a blushing, timid joy, which was a poor preparation for the blow in store for her. 19*  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7632-00000109"/> 222     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. The day had nearly rivalled its predecessor in beauty. The rosy tints of sunset still lingered in the western sky, and the soft veil of an April twilight was but just beginning to dim their brilliancy. It was a still evening - so very still, that no perceptible breeze was stirring; and Clyde, as she watched the sunset, had in her thoughts compared the calm evening with the peaceful stillness in her heart. She had dressed her- self carefully to meet her lover, with a new pleasure in the dainty arts of dress, because they were exercised for him, and fair as she had been in the evening cos- tume she had Worn the night before, Ralph Bertrand thought her even fairer in the simple house-dress of blue cashmere which she wore, a ribbon of the same color in her hair, and the faint rose still blushing in her cheeks that meeting him had made to bloom there. Without a word he came to her, and, taking both her hands in his, drew her gently into the great bay window, where they would be screened from observa- tion. There they stood for a moment, her sweet eyes falling under his; the soft rose deepening in her cheeks, and the next moment he had thrown his arms around her, and caught her passionately to his heart. She nestled there, yieldingly; she was his- his very- own; why should she shrink from him? They loved one another; why need they hesitate to acknowledge it, or to show it? She did not ask him why he had not come sooner; now that he was here, she was fully satisfied and content with his presence. He released her presently, almost putting her away   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        223 from him. His voice was the first to break the silence, and there was a strange constraint in its tones as he said: "Clyde, look at me!" The twilight was deepening, but Clyde saw, as in obedience to his bidding she raised her eyes, that Ralph Bertrand's face was pale, and his mouth set, under his moustache, with an expression she had never before seen there. Yet he gave her no time to speak; he went on, hurriedly  "Yes, look at me, Clyde, and listen to me; and then forgive me, if you can. You women are said to be forgiving - to be better than us men; you have not the same temptations that we have; you know nothing of them; how can you? Prove your goodness to me to-day; don't make me suspect the whole sex." "I do not understand you," she faltered. And then-he scarcely knew how or in what words he did it - he told Clyde the whole story. How when they two first met, he had been engaged to Nora; how she had steadily refused to let their engagement be known; how, by slow degrees, he had learned to love her- Clyde - and to wish that he could win her. How he told it, he scarcely knew; his voice trembled like a woman's when he spoke of the scene of the night before; and then he paused; the worst was yet to come. "Clyde," he said, trying to speak calmly, "I can scarcely bear to tell you the rest. What you will think of me I do not know. I forgot Nora last night; for-  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7632-00000110"/> Z!14    CLYDE W AKUL Ei Un. got all, except this - that I was with you, and that I loved ypu. That was my only thought; it is my only excuse. I knew nothing of Nora's return; I had for- gotten her very existence. But last night when I met her I remembered all, and what I had done suddenly flashed across me. She bade me come to her to-day. I went there. It is but fair, but right, that you should know all. I told her the whole truth; how I had mistaken my feelings towards her; that I had learned to love you; I pleaded with her to release me, but in vain, for she refused. Clyde, knowing all this - know- ing that I am the promised husband of another, that I had no right to betray my own feelings and to win from you the sweet acknowledgment of your love, can you, will you ever forgive me?" A strange, sharp pang shot through Clyde's heart as she listened. She caught her breath; it was hard to be calm, aftd to bear this unexpected torture silently; she was thankful to the fast gathering dusk for its friendly concealment of her face; she tried to speak, but no words came. "Have you nothing to say to me?" he asked, pas- sionately, after waiting for her to answer him. "Clyde, this is torment; speak to me!" "You spoke to Nora," was all she could say, and her voice sounded strangely in her own ears. "I did, Clyde; I pleaded with her as though for life, but all in vain; she will not release me; she holds me to my word." "On what plea?"   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        225 "On what plea, you may well ask. On a strange one, as I think, and yet it is the only one that can excuse or explain her refusal; she says she loves me! But what sort of love can it be that is content with the worse than nothingness that I can give her in return?" And you love her?" "Can you ask me that question, Clyde? It is honor alone that pledges me now to her. Yet how can I bear to give you up? My darling-- my darling! why is it in her power to give us this pain? Oh, Clyde, Clyde! I cannot give you up. Give me but one word of encouragement, and I will -" "Hush!" the girl said, trying to throw off the stunning effects of the blow which had fallen upon her, so as to-soothe her lover. "It is too late now; your honor pledges you to Nora. I have no right to be considered. Ralph," her voice lingered lovingly on the name, " dearest Ralph, you are an honorable man; be brave, and do your duty. What," as the strong man's frame shook with ill-suppressed emotion, "will you let me be braver than you are? See, I can tell you to leave me; I had rather see you do what is right than be happy myself." "Can it be right that we should be so miserable?" he said, hoarsely. "Clyde--you loveme?" "Yes," she said, as he paused, anxiously waiting for a reply, but I hold your honor dearer, more precious to me than my love for you. Your word is pledged to Nora; forget this brief dream of ours, and be happy." It was hard for her to speak calmly, with P  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7632-00000111"/> 226     C LYDE WARDLEIGH. those quivering lips of hers; he could not see them, nor the deathly pallor of the sweet face. "Will you forget it?" he asked. "Will you be happy? God bless you that you have loved me, Clyde! I wish, too, that you had not, and yet I shall be a better man for that thought. This is hard; hard for us both; hardest for me, because you have nothing with which to reproach yourself. Blame me, if you will; it seems to me I could bear reproaches from you better than this brave urging to do my duty." "Why should I reproach you?" she said, trying to put away all thought of herself. "I should rather encourage you, instead of trying to make your task harder. And yet--" her voice failed. And yet, we might have been so happy together! Can you bear the thought of all we have lost?" "I can, because I must," was her firm reply. "Our duty lies plainly enough before us, and we must not shrink from it." "I do not deserve this from you, Clyde," Ralph Bertrand said, taking her hand. "Why do you not blame me for what I have brought upon you? I surely deserve it." "Should I make your burden heavier? Can I not guess by my own feelings what yours must be? No, Ralph, there is but one thing left for us to say, and that is-" "Clyde, dearest Clyde," he interrupted, "before we part, as part we must, say at least that you forgive me." She laid both hands in his.   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        227 "Fully - freely - entirely." They stood there, land in hand, in the April even- ing's gloom, these two who loved one another. Then, with the words, "It is the last time; tell the others the truth," Bertrand drew Clyde's slight form to him in a strong and close embrace; his lips sought hers in a long kiss; he once more murmured, "Clyde, forgive me," and the next moment he was gone. And so Clyde's brief dream of happiness ended, as it had' begun, with the words, "Clyde, forgive me." Even with Ralph Bertrand's departure she did not feel that she could yield to her feelings. They claimed indulgence the more for the restraint she had placed upon them, but that must be deferred to a more con- venient season, when she might weep in private. She was so thankful now that the secret rested between themselves--the suffering would be easier to bear. It was a return to the old feelings after her mother's death, which had made her bear all in silence, and live to herself. She waited for a few moments in the dark parlor, endeavoring to compose herself before joining the rest of the family in the library; only for a few moments, for she knew that the longer she put off what she had to do, and the more she thought it over, the harder it would be for her. She murmured, under her breath, "It is so hard to do right; so very hard to do right!" and then, pressing her hand to her heart, as though to still its strange, uneasy beatings, she went into the library.  There was no light in the room, except from the  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7632-00000112"/> 228     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. warm bed of coals glowing in the grate; but to Clyde, coming as she did from the dark parlor, it seemed almost as bright as day. "Why did not Ralph come in to speak to us?" her uncle asked. "His visits have been very infrequent of late." "I imagine they will be more infrequent now than ever," Clyde said, with affected playfulness. "I have a piece of news for you, which will perhaps explain his absence; he is engaged to Nora Reynolds." Exclamations of surprise followed. "Did he tell you?"Ellen inquired. "Yes," was Clyde's only answer. "Young folks will lose their hearts and marry," was Mr. Bertrand's comment.  "First Nell, now Ralph; it will be Clyde's turn next." "I never expect to leave you, Uncle Bertrand, as long as you are willing to keep me with you." "And we are not at all anxious to give you up," Mrs. Bertrand said, as Clyde drew a low stool to her side, and, seating herself upon it, laid her head upon her aunt's knee, with that wish for petting and tender- ness which sometimes comes to us in times of sorrow. "What is the matter, my child?" she asked, as she laid her cool hand on Clyde's brow; "'your head burns as if you had fever." "It only aches, Aunt Margaret; it has been so very warm these last two days that one can scarcely expect anything else." Poor Clyde! it was an almost pardonable falsehdod.   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         229 "The first few spring days are always oppressive and hard to bear," Mrs. Bertrand replied. "You were up very late last night, so I am going to send you to bed, Clyde; a good night's rest is the best prescription I can give you." It was all Clyde wanted- to be alone; but no sleep came to close her eyes that night. But the pale cheeks and heavy eyes she carried about the next morning were only noticed as the consequence of her headache, and she was thankful to have it so. That day people had something to talk about ahd to discuss, in the announcement of Miss Reynoldls' and Mr. Bertrand's engagement. CHAPTER XX. NORA'S ADVICE. "He either fears his fate too moich, Or his deserts are small, That dares not put it to the touch, To gain or lose it all." TT was with no very great satisfaction that Nora listened to and received the congratulations of her friends. Her interview with Bertrand had indeed brought matters to a climax, and its result was very different from what she had either expected or desired. But there was no help for it ; she had seen that she 20       .   &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7632-00000113"/> 230     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. held Bertrand by a most uncertain tenure, and that her only chance of securing him, even for a time, would be to acknowledge herself bound. His first words had shown her this; she had no time to lose; and so she found herself, in order to prove to Bertrand that she was sincere, not only compelled to request him to acknowledge their engagement, but, to give effect and weight to this permission, forced to add that she loved him.  It was a deliberate falsehood, as Nora well knew; but what did she care for that? she was willing to tell as many falsehoods as might be needed to secure success, and this one did not lie very heavily upon her conscience. All that she regretted was that things could not remain in their normal condition; she foresaw that her acknowledged engagement to Bertrand would interfere seriously with her designs upon Clarke; but it had almost been forced upon her, and she must now try, like a skilful general, to make the best of the situation. But, to counterbalance this disadvantage, was the knowledge she possessed of Clyde's love for Ralph Bertrand. It may seem strange that Nora should have discovered this, when it was unknown to, and unsus- pected by those who best knew and loved her; but jealousy is often more clear-sighted than affection, and Nora's old jealousy of Clyde had gifted her with acute perceptions. It was no new thing; it had begun even in their school-days, when, though Nora's mental abil- ities were of a far higher order, Clyde's quiet perse- verance and untiring industry had enabled her co stand   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        231 as well in her classes. Nora had sought and striven for popularity; Clyde had never even thought of try- ing to gain it; yet while the one was admired by many, the other was loved by the few whom  her natural timidity had allowed to know her well. Nora's jealousy of Clyde had slowly grown into dislike. Clyde never suspected its existence; she would have been greatly surprised had any one told her of it; she did not know that, after the two entered society, Nora grudged her the admiration so freely offered, and to which Clyde was almost indifferent. She would have been pained by neglect, but admiration to her was not the pleasant incense essential to her happiness, that it was to Nora. She little guessed that she had brought Nora's jealousy to its climax by winning Clarke Henderson's heart, unintentionally though it had been, and that Nora, by a strange con- tradiction, hated her the more because she was in- different to his love; and that she took an intense delight in thinking that Clyde, through her love for Ralph Bertrand, must suffer the pangs of disappointed affection. She was almost grateful to Clyde for this; she knew it would secure, beyond the possibility of a doubt, a rejection for Clarke, for nothing in the world would have induced Clyde Wardleigh, loving one man, to marry another. This accomplished, Nora, felt that she probably could forgive and forget all the rest; and leave Ralph and Clyde to be happy in their own way, provided Clarke turned at last to her. Not yet, however. She had no wish to play the part  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7632-00000114"/> 232     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. of a disconsolate damsel, and not until she herself was sure of winning the prize she desired would she release Ralph Bertrand from his enforced engagement. Clarke had left the city, to be absent for a week, the morning after Lille Lewis's wedding, and until his return Nora could do nothing. He came home at last, however, and the very first morning after his return he came lazily into Nora's sitting-room, and threw himself upon the soft cushions of the lounge. It was a dismal, rainy day, too doleful and rainy, he declared, to go to his office, and so he had come to Nora for amusement. "It seems very nice to have you at home again, Nora," he said, as he lighted his cigar. "First, it is very charming and sensible in you that you do not object to a good cigar; and secondly, I have missed you prodigiously. Only, I am afraid that I shall find Bertrand very much in my way, nowadays; of course you'll be wholly taken up with him. I say, Nora, how long since you've been engaged?" "Suppose we talk of something else," Nora said, carelessly. "I've seen nothing of you for two months, Clarke; I don't count the two (ays before the wedding, and have not even been able to tell you how much I liked your -book." Thank you; but that's an old story now, Nora." "As if all authors did not enjoy being praised," she retorted. "Old story or not, it has made you quite an important personage, Clarke, and I can assure you that I am very proud of my cousin." "And I am  very fond of mine," Clarke said,   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        233 "especially when she says such very nice things to me," little thinking how Nora's heart throbbed with pleasure at his words. "Nora, I don't see why you want to marry; home will not be home without you."  "As if you will not be making a home for yourself some of these days," she laughed. "How do you do with Clyde now? two months should have worked wonders." "They have worked - notling." "Nothing!"Nora repeated; "do you mean that Clyde has refused you?" "No," he said, "for-I have not yet given her the opportunity." "You have not!"   Nora exclaiied, in well acted surprise; "and why?" "'Because I am very doubtful as to the result." "' He either fears his fate too much, Or his deserts are small, That dares not put it to the touch, To gain or lose it all,'" Nora quoted. "I think it is the dread that I may 'lose it all,'" Clarke said, soberly, " which deters me. Nora, I am a very coward about this; I fairly 'fear my fate."' "'Faint heart never won fair lady,'"Nora went on, mischievously. "  You can't win your 'fair lady' without asking her, Clarke; not a very hard thing to do, I should think." "Do you really think I have any chance of success, OI   &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7632-00000115"/> 234     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. Nora?" he asked, eagerly. "You and Clyde are inti- mate." "She has not taken me into her confidence," Nora interrupted, hastily; "and even if she had, Clarke, do you think that I would betray her? No, you must find that out for yourself." "You are right, Nora," he said; " my question was scarcely a fair one. Give me a sheet of paper and a pen, and I believe I will write to Clyde." "You will do nothing of the kind, Clarke. Such a business-like proceeding as you would make of it! Clyde would not thank you, I know, for such a letter. Come, you know well enough how to tell your story; you ought to be able to plead your cause in words as well as in writing. You would be sure of finding your 'lady-love' at home this morning; go to her at once; there is no time like the present for action, and then come and tell me how you have sped in your wooing." "Do you really advise this?" he said, as he lazily arose from his reclining position. Will you not wish me success, Nora? and, provided that Clyde is willing to accept me, cannot we make arrangements to be mar- ried the same day? Are you agreed?" I certainly am," Nora said, earnestly. "Then here goes to try my fate. Nora, when I see you again, I hope to come to you as the happiest man in the whole world, unless I should be so unfortunate as to be refused. But I will not think of that yet." "Why should you?"Nora asked; "and yet," she   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        235 added, as the door closed upon her cousin, "it is the only fate in store for him. Poor fellow! I could almost pity him for the disappointment it will be to him; but he will come to me for consolation, and hearts are easily caught in the rebound." She had carefully avoided expressing any opinion about Clyde's feelings; she preferred that Clarke should find out the truth for himself. It was a dreary day that Clarke, by Nora's advice, had selected for the telling of his love-story. If April can deck her lovely face in sunshiny smiles, she can, like her rough brother, March, hide her beauty in clouds and rain, and be changeable as a woman. No trace of blue sky was visible; a fine, cold, penetrating rain was falling; the spring flowers which were in bloom looked as if they thought they had ventured forth too early; the streets were deserted, except by those who were called out by business, and Clarke was glad to wrap his overcoat closely around him, and to pull his hat down over his eyes as he waited for the car which would convey him to the Bertrands' house. He scarcely felt the disagreeable influences of the day, how- ever; he was too much engrossed in his own thoughts to care very much whether the sun shone or not- provided Clyde smiled upon him, there was nothing else necessary. He reached the house at last, and upon asking if Miss Wardleigh was at home, was told that he would find her in the library. He was too intimate at the house to consider it necessary to send in his name, so,  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7632-00000116"/> 236     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. quietly taking it for granted that Clyde would see him, he went into the library. It was unoccupied, save by Clyde, and she was lying by the window, apparently engaged with a book. Clarke came softly across the room, but he was not prepared for the start with which she raised herself as he spoke, or for her pale cheeks and heavy eyes. "Clyde, are you sick?" he exclaimed. "I beg your pardon if I have startled you, but the offence was unintentional." "And I have no business to be so nervous," she replied; 'I thought you were out of town, and did not expect to see you, or any one else, to-day, so I came in here to lie down." Then am I disturbing you?" "No; for I am very glad to see you, Clarke. I had begun to grow very tired of myself; one's own thoughts being at times very disagreeable companions, and I shall be glad to escape from them for a tiie." "I don't like to see you so pale." "Blame these spring days for it, and not me," was her reply; "I have always found them hard to bear, but this year they have been more trying than usual, and they have brought me numerous headaches, which are not the most delightful things in the world. I thought I would read mine away to-day, but it seems I read myself to sleep, and you awakened me." "I am very sorry," Clarke began; "but then, you see, Clyde, I was sure of finding you at home this morn- ing, and I had not seen you for a week-a whole week!"        X    CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        237 "Only a week," Clyde repeated, as though to her- self, thinking what a long time it had been; judging by her feelings, it had seemed a lifetime. Bravely though she had borne herself in that trying interview with Bertrand, and bravely though she had ever since tried to conceal her feelings -to bear all in secret, and unsuspected - there were moments when it all seemed to come over her with a new pain; and this was one of those moments, when she could scarcely realize that all of the suffering she had endured had been crowded into such a brief space of time. "I fear you will find me but a stupid companion this morning," she continued, looking up to Clarke with a smile he never guessed was forced, "but I will trust to your good nature to excuse me." I am willing to do all the talking, if only you will listen, Clyde," he said, drawing his chair closer to her; "I have a story to tell you, which I hope will interest you; only you must promise not to interrupt me till I am through." Something in his tone made her look up, and, with a woman's quickness, she guessed what his story would be. "I wish -" she began, but he interrupted her. "Clyde, you may as well hear me out; you must hear me some time; as well now as ever. You must know, you do lknow, what it is that I wish to say' what I have long wished to say to you, but hirat I would not say until I had something Itlhought worth offering for your acceptance. Clyde, what literary  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7632-00000117"/> 238  .  CLYDE WARDLEIGH. fame I have, I tried to win' for your sake; I only sought it, I only prized it in hopes it might help me to be more worthy of you; without you it is valueless; and oh, Clyde! I have loved you so long; I do love yot so dearly!" He had dropped upon one knee by her side as he spoke, and was looking up eagerly into her face with a world of expression in his clear gray eyes. Clyde pushed the wavy fair hair from his brow with a sister's gentle caress, before she replied; the action might have been answer enough. "Oh, Clarke! Clarke! why have you done this? My poor boy; I would so gladly have spared you this pain - spared it to myself as well as to you " "Why need it be pain to either of us?" he asked, tenderly. "Clyde, you cannot doubt my love for you -you know that it is no new thing; does that knowl- edge give you pain?" "Cannot you understand, Clarke?" she asked,. almost reproachfully. "Why do you force me to say it - that I hoped you would only care for me as for a friend?" "But it is no friendship, Clyde, and you must long since have known that, for I never tried to conceal my feelings from you; nor is it friendship that I ask from you; it is more than that I want." "And more than that I cannot give, you, Clarke." "Do not say that, Clyde," he pleaded; "I know only too well that I am not worthy of you I never expect to be - but surely, surely, you do not dislike me?"   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        239 "Far, very far from it." 'Then, Clyde, why may I not hope? Only give me time, and you may yet learn to love me." "Ah, Clarke, do you not know that love cannot be learned as a lesson? -it must come freely, or else it comes not at all. Clarke, it is as hard for me to say it to you as it is for you to hear it; but it is the truest kindness to tell you at once that we can never be more to one another than we now are." "Don't say that, Clyde," he urged; "do you realize to what you are condemning me? what a crushing blow this is to nme? what a destroying of long cher- ished hopes? You were the first love of my boyhood -you are the one love of my manhood.  Clyde! Clyde! have you no pity for me?" "No pity?" she asked, gently. "It is all pity, Clarke; I only wish I could tell you how much I feel for you - how sincerely I hope you may yet be happy." "'And yet you refuse me the only thing that can make.,ne happy; you refuse to make nme happy! Only try me, Clyde; put me to any test; make ime submit to any probation that you will; I am ready to do anything, so long as I win you in the end." He had taken both her hands in his ,as he knelt beside her, and was looking earnestly iinto her face. Clyde's soft blue eyes filled with tears as she returned his gaze. "My poor boy! cannot I convince you that there is no hope - cannot you be content with our old friend- ship? Cannot you believe that I feel for you - that  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7632-00000118"/> 240     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. I know what you are enduring? Clarke, you say that you love me, and I believe you do; show your love for me by trying to conquer it, because I ask it of you." "Ask me to love you, and the task would be easier," he said, eagerly. "Clyde, you do not know what a hard thing you are asking of me; how can you know?" "Do I not?" she said, and her voice faltered. "Clarke, to save you pain, you, my brother, I would do much; but it would be cruel in me to give you hope when I know that nothing will ever make me change my determination. Clarke, would you know- ingly, willingly, give me pain?" Can you ask that, Clyde?" "Then prove it by ceasing your entreaties; it is very hard for me to refuse you very hard for me to see you suffer; I would have spared it to you if I could. Will you not forgive me?" It is I that should ask forgiveness," he said, mourn- fully. "Clyde, this is very hard to bear, very hard to realize; you cannot expect a few words, a few mo- ments, to undo the work of years." "I do not wish to undo it wholly," she said, ear- nestly. "No, I hope still to be your friend, your sister. Clarke brother - you will be content with this?" "I will try," he said, as he released her hands andl rose to his feet. He stood for a moment looking down upon her. "Clyde, it is, I know, a strange thing to ask, yet, show me that I am your brother -show me   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        241 that you forgive my vain urgency; give me one kiss before we part." She hesitated for one moment; it seemed to her that her lips were sacred to her first, her only love; that no love-kiss but his ought ever to be laid upon them. But her heart was full of a tender pity for Clarke; she had refused him so much, that she could not bear to refuse him this little favor. She looked up, and the mourn- ful expression of his face decided her; without a word, she raised her face to his. He bent down; he kissed her once, twice; gently and reverently, as a man would kiss the lips of his dead mother- almost as sadly-- and then, without another word, he left her. And Clyde, throwing herself again upon the lounge, wept - wept bitterly, as though her heart would break. She had not shed such tears over her own sorrow as those which she now wept for Clarke's disappointment, but they did her good. A tearless grief is the hardest to bear; the falling drops soothe and soften our pain. Clyde's tears relieved her; they were almost the first that she had shed. It needed no words on Clarke's part to tell Nora, when he returned, with what success he had met. One glance at his face was enough; but she waited for him to speak. "Well," was all she said. "It is anything but 'well,'" was his rather moody reply. "Nora, Clyde has refused me." You surely know the meaning of a woman's No?" 21        Q  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7632-00000119"/> 242     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. "' It means ' no' in this case." "I hope you will not sit, and ' Wasting in despair, Die, because a woman 's fair! '" Nora said, a little too playfully. Clarke, you are not the only man who has met with a disappointment- take it coolly, and say: ' If she be not 'fair' to me, What care I how fair she be?" "Only I cannot help caring," he said. "Nora, I thought you would be sorry for me, and instead of that, you laugh at me." "Far from it, Clarke," was her eager answer. "I am indeed truly sorry for you, and your disappoint- ment, but I candidly think that the loss is Clyde's, not yours." "Nora!" She saw her mistake at once, and hastened to correct it. "I beg your pardon, Clarke, but, as you see, I can scarcely forgive her for causing you all this pain." And all the time Nora was thinking to herself how beautifully all things were working together to assist her. She felt more encouraged and hopeful than ever; a very short time now, and she believed her efforts would be crowned with success.   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        243 CHAPTER XXI. CLYDE'S BIRTHDAY. "When sorrows come, they come not single spies, But in battalions." APRIL passed. May came- came and went, and in her turn gave place to June, the sweetest, most joyous, most perfect month of the whole year. She brought with her, as she is wont, " perfect days;" days crowned with rose-wreaths, glorious with, sunshine, full of all beauty, and warm with the sun's bright rays. For she is queen of the months, and each returning year brings her to us with a new and ever young beauty; a joyous beauty of which we are never weary, and which is as dear and as wonderful to age as it is to those whom the fair month finds lingering still in the sweet June-years of life--the joyous years of youth. But to Clyde Wardleigh it was a month of sad anniversaries. It was in June that her mother had died; and that she herself had wept, kneeling, in such bitter grief, orphaned and friendless, by the coffin. Every. June, as it returns, brings back to Clyde the recollection of that crushing sorrow,- she remembers how the honeysuckle-blossoms smelled that day - how the white June roses looked, and the frgrgrance of the one, the sight of the other, are always associated in her mind with that mournful time, to which, even now,  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7632-00000120"/> 244     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. though years have passed since then, she never recurs in words, and not often in thought - the pain is too intense. But this year that old pain is almost forgot- ten--the newer, sharper grief that came to Clyde with the coming spring has nearly effaced it; the pres- ent has overpowered the past, as it always does and always will. Clyde thinks, but with a lessening pain, of that old sorrow; that was hard, but this is harder to bear; and her pity for herself, her knowledge of what it means to love, and to love in vain, makes her heart very tender for Clarke, whom she has 9ondemned to similar sorrow. She has never felt as much pity for any one before; she wishes that she could have spared him, but it is only that, for the first time in her life, she knows from her own experience what this pain must be. She has tried so hard to be herself, to show no change, that it is a relief to her when June comes, and they all know that she is never as bright then as at other times. It has been a very hard spring for her; Ellen is too much engrossed with Robert Haynes to be able to devote much time to her cousin; Clarke is away, travelling with gp party of friends;. Lille Lloyd is in Europe; Nora is gayer than ever, making the most of the brief space of liberty left her, she says. She comes occasionally to see Clyde, but Clyde avoids her, and is ashamed of herself for it; but it is a feeling she cannot overcome. Ralph Bertrand never comes to the house; Clyde knows this is better and more pru-  'dent for both, but there are times when she would give   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        245 worlds for the mere sight of his face, the sound of his voice; and every now and then she is conscious of a sharp, sudden pain in her heart, which is gone so soon that it is scarcely worth mentioning, she thinks, when she thinks of it at all, for it is gone so soon that she barely knows it has come .before it is over. And so the days go by in outward calm, till June brings her second anniversary - the day of Clyde's birth. She herself had wholly forgotten it; the day might have come and gone, and she would not have remem- bered it. Anniversaries are such sad things to us as we grow older; the days which in childhood are days of such perfect enjoyment, become, to us who have left the thoughtless hearts and careless glee of childhood behind us in the past, days full of sad thoughts and mournful recollections. Clyde was too young for this as yet, if her age be counted by years; but she had always, so it seemed to herself, been grown up; she had had no childhood, for even as a child her life had been darkened by the shadows of cares and trials which usually only fall to 6ur share in. maturer years'; but somehow the past two months seemed to have saddened her more than all the twenty-one years she had lived. But if Clyde had forgotten, in the other more engross- ing thoughts which filled her mind, the return of her birthday, others had not. Never once, since she had shared their home, had her uncle and aunt omitted to mark its yearly recurrence by giving her some token of affectionate remembrance. It was not forgotten this. year; with the usual greetings for the day, the wishes 21 *  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7632-00000121"/> 246     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. for its "many happy returns," they each had some pres- ent for her, selected in accordance with her well-known tastes; and Ellen playfully scolded her cousin for try- ing to make them think she had forgotten the day. "I shall begin to think that you do not rightly value or appreciate the fact that you are your own mis- tress, Clyde, or that to-day you are 'free, white, and twenty-one.'" "I'm afraid I don't, Nell," was the quiet reply, "for I really had forgotten that such was the case." "' Accidentally on purpose,' Ellen went on, gaily. "Clyde, did you intend to give up having any more birthdays, and never to grow any older? I used to think, when I was a very little girl, that people only grew older on their birthdays. What use do you intend making of your liberty? Will, you set out immediately as an advocate of woman's rights? a female lecturer? or will you join the phalanx of those enlightened and advanced creatures who indulge in Bloomers, and want to vote? You have ample room for choice before you - which will you select?  Not one of them," smiling. My talents do not lie in that direction, Ellen." "No, they don't," Ellen said, throwing her arms -around her cousin. "Here, I am going to give you twenty-one kisses, one for every year of your life; and my birthday wish to you is that by this time next year you may find some one you will like, because he likes you, very much, as much -" "As you like Robert Haynes," Clyde interrupted   CLYDE WARDLthIGH.        247 her. "Thank you, Nell; but what would Aunt Mar- garet say to losing both of us?" "She would try to think only of her daughters' happiness," MArs. Bertrand said, smiling at the two fair girls. "I am not anxious to part with either of you; but I know that young birds will, after a while, leave the nest." "I like my home-nest too well to care about leaving it, Aunt Margaret," Clyde replied; "and I think that you are pretty sure of keeping this one of your ' daughters' with you." "Until Mr. Right comes," Ellen retorted. "Nell thinks that because she has found her Mr. Right, that he is a person absolutely indispensable to everybody else, Aunt Margaret," was Clyde's answer. "She judges every one by herself." "I only want you to be as happy as I am," was Ellen's affectionate reply; and Clyde sighed to think how impossible that was. But their remembrance of her, and Ellen's playful teasing, had done Clyde good. She was more like herself that bright June day than she had been for weeks, and, as she thought with deep gratitude of the love and affection her friends gave her, she began to wonder if after all she might not find something in life worth living for; she began to ask herself if it was right that she should go mourning all her days because one blessing- only one, but she did not attempt to undervalue it,-was, denied her. It was the crown and glory of life, to be sure, which she had lost; only  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7632-00000122"/> 248     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. seen for a moment, and then snatched away from her sight-that sweet romance, that happy dream, was past and over forever, and Clyde knew that nothing could ever renew it- the chief flower and blossom of her life. Yet that life might be useful and pleasant to others, though in her own sight all its beauty was gone; and Clyde resolved that from this very day, her birthday, she would try to conquer herself--to put aside her grief-it was too recent as yet for her to forget it wholly- and to be in truth what her aunt fondly called her, her daughter, with no thought save how best to please her adopted parents. No thought of a second love crossed Clyde's mind; she could not understand the possibility of a woman's loving two men; it seemed to' her that the words "I love you," once spoken frogm the heart, could never again be truthfully said to or felt for another. Some women can, and do love once, twice, nay, three times - each time, it may be, as tenderly and sincerely as at first, like the rose which greets each returning spring with new beauty of bloom; but it was not so with Clyde. Like the aloe, blooming but once, she could love but once; with her, as with some few women, and they are the best of their sex, ' Love is indestructible; Its holy flame forever burneth;" though too often, as to Clyde, it comes with pain and grief, until what is meant to be our greatest blessing, turns into our heaviest burden, our greatest trial.    CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        249 Hitherto Clyde had tried to conceal what she felt- to bear it all in secret and unsuspected. Yet she had, in a measure, indulged her grief; she had dwelt upon it, and allowed it to engross many of her thoughts, until it had become the pre-eminent idea in her mind. She began to see that this was wrong - that it should be struggled against and overcome, if possible; she had, in truth, no right to think of Ralph Bertrand as she had been doing. He would soon be the husband of another; and then, what now was only wrong, would, if persisted in, be neither more nor less than sinful. She resolved to struggle against her feelings, and to overcome them, and, so true it is that the mere attempt to do right brings its own reward, she felt more at ease, more content with herself, than she had done since the evening on which she had learned the truth. It may seem strange that Clyde did not blame Ralph Bertrand. Most women, in similar circum- stances, would have done so; but Clyde only pitied him. She knew it had been no intentional error on his part,- that he had been, as it were, surprised into it, that he- had done everything in his power to make amends,-and then she loved him too well to blame him. If any one deserved blame it was Nora. But Clyde dismissed that thought as it rose; she said to herself that Nora mighlt with even more reason blame her for coming between herself and her lover. She was walking up and down the piazza in the soft June moonlight, thinking over all this, when her  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7632-00000123"/> 250     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. uncle came to the door and called her. He had a little business to settle with her, he said, and if she would come to his office, they could arrange it at once. Clyde rather wondered what business it could be that her uncle could possibly have with her; but, ask- ing no questions, she quietly followed Mr. Bertrand to the room which he called his office, where he wrote his letters and attended to any business which might pur- sue him to his home. He laughed when he saw her perplexed expression as she came up to the table at which he had seated himself, and which was covered with papers. '. You look very much puzzled," he said to Clyde, as she sat down by the table; "and yet it is a matter of no very great importance, --only I want to say to you that you are now of age, and, consequently, my duties as your guardian are at an end. I am also bound to render an account to you of the property left you by your mother; and if you will look over this paper, I think you will find that your interests -have not suffered in my hands," He pushed a formidable-looking document across the table to Clyde as he spoke. She did not even glance at it.  "As if anything of the kind were needed between you and me, Uncle Bertrand!-you, who for six years have treated me as if I was indeed your own child,- who have made no difference between Ellen and my- self; and for you to give me this, -as if I did not know that you would do the very best you could for   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         251 me! I feel really hurt to think you would give me this long account, just as if we were strangers!" ' Business recognizes no ties of -affection, Clyde," her uncle said, smiling. "If Ellen had property in- dependently of me, I should feel bound to render her an account of it, so why should you object? It will not take very long. Come sit down by me, and let me explain it to you. Some day you may have to manage it for yo6urself, and it will do you no harm to understand it." He was really in earnest, in spite of hs playful tone, and Clyde obeyed him. I am quite an heiress, after all," she said, as her uncle finally pushed away the papers. "Yes," heb said. "You might, if you chose, set up an establishment of your own. I wonder if you will, being your own mistress." "And leave you, Uicle Bertrand, after all these years? No; as long as you will keep me, my home is with you; and I only hope I may some day be able to show you how fully I do appreciate all you have done for me." "My dear child! as if you have not been to us as a daughter-! as if in that you have not fully repaid us! We have never for a moment regretted your corning into our home, and we hope it will be a long time before you leave it for one of your own. Now sign your name here, Clyde, and then give me a kiss, and tell me I have not been a very stern guardian to my little girl."  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7632-00000124"/> 25*2    CLYDE WARDLEIGH. "o very stern," Clyde said, as she threw her arms around his neck, " that I wonder if any girl ever had as kind an uncle as mine. The only fault I have to find with him is, that he should have considered this stupid old account necessary. Uncle Bertrand, I give you fair warning that I never intend to look at an- other. I consider them altogether useless, and know you will always do the best you can for me." "Then, Clyde," he said, more seriously than he had yet spoken, will you trust to my judgment to-day? Will you let me advise you, as I think, for the best?  'Why should you ask, Uncle Bertrand?"Clyde said, in some surprise. "To whose advice could I better trust than to yours? You do not need my permission, surely, to say what you please to me." He went across the room to a secretary, which he unlocked, and took from it a letter, which he handed to Clyde. She uttered a low exclamation of surprise as she looked at it; for it bore her name, written, too, in the handwriting she had never expected to'see again -the handwriting of her mother. "How did you get it, Uncle Bertrand, and why was it not given to me long before?" she asked, hur- riedly. { To think that you should have kept it from me all this time, and never told me of its existence!  She was about to tear it open, when her uncle de- tained her. "Clyde," he said, "that letter was found among your mother's papers, enclosed in one to your aunt, which requested her not to give it to you until   CLYDE WARDLEIGIE        253 this day should come. My child, I know its contents; you have hitherto been- ignorant of them. You said you were willing to trust to my judgment, to take my advice. It is this, that you will burn that letter with- out reading it!"  "Uncle Bertrand! are you in earnest?" "Sincerely in earnest, I can assure you, Clyde; though it seems strange to ask you to close your ears to your mother's last message, believe me when I say I am speaking only for your good. That letter holds a secret which had best be forgotten, which has im- bittered one life; do not let it imbitter yours. Do not read it, Clyde. Your mother, I know, meant to do right when she wrote it, and I, of course, was bound to place it in your hands, although I have frequently felt tempted to destroy it. I wish you would do it at once, Clyde. Come," he said, smiling, "let prudence prevail over feminine curiosity, and give me the satis- faction of seeing you are a wise woman by refusing to know- what I really think you had best leave un- known." "And not read her last words, her last message, to me -refuse, it may be, her last request?"Clyde said, reproachfully. "Uncle Bertrand, do you know how much you are asking of me?  No very hard thing to grant, surely, Clyde," her uncle said, seriously. "Hitherto you were ignorant of the existence of this letter; and it can be no very great trial for you to burn it, unread, especially when I tell you that I think the contents of it may do harm. 22  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7632-00000125"/> 254    CLYDE WARDLEIGH. I think they are founded upon a mistake. Clyde, you know nothing of the circumstances connected with your mother's marriage; this letter contains the whole story, - for we were requested to read it, - and I can as- sure you that you will be none the happier for read- ing it. Still, it belongs to you, and you, of course, have a right to act as you consider best. I can only tell you what your aunt's and my wishes are, and then leave you to judge for yourself; but if you will be guided by me, you will let me burn it at once." "Give me till to-morrow to decide, Uncle Ber- trand," Clyde said, quietly. "I know you would only advise me for my own good. I know that you must be right; but you surely cannot blame me for wishing to know what the contents of this poor letter are?" "Nor shall I blame you if you read it, Clyde," was the quick reply; "only I hope you will tell me to- morrow that it has been burnt. You will be all the ' happier for it." Then, he added, jestingly, "Remem- ber Fatima and Blue Beard's key; you may regret re- fusing my request as much as that inquisitive female regretted her use of that little implement. There, I have done; you .may go now, and I know my little girl will not disappoint me in my estimate of her wisdom!" She carried that letter in her pocket for the rest of the evening. Visitors came in, and even had Clyde wished it, there was no opportunity for her to be alone. It was late before she was at liberty to go to her room,   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        255 and then she sat by her window, the letter in her hand, thinking. In Clyde's mind there were many reasons both for and against her uncle's request. Without good and sufficient reasons he never would have spoken as he did; it was the wish to save her that had prompted his words, and the girl almost wished that he had burned it without her knowledge. But, on the other hand, it was her mother's writing, which she had never ex- pected to see again; it was like a message which had come to her, as it were, across the great space separating them--a voice from beyond the grave--from   the mother she had so idolized. She only thought of this; she forgot her uncle's wish in the strong desire that she felt to read what was her mother's last legacy to her, -the words of affectionate counsel and warning which, it might be, were left to her, - left to her now because the child of fifteen could not appreciate them. And so Clyde hesitated not longer, but with an eager, trembling hand she broke the seal, and, unfolding the closely-written sheets, began to read them. She wondered at first why it was that Mr. Bertrand had pleaded with her so earnestly to destroy the letter. Its first pages were full of such tender words, such loving counsel, that, coming as they did with the sa- credness of a dead mother's love lingering about and consecrating them, they brought many tears to Clyde's eyes. It was her mother speaking to her again, as of old; and, as Clyde read, she thought no dearer gift for her birthday could have been bestowed upon her.  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7632-00000126"/> 256     CIYDE WARDLEIGH. But presently, as she read, she began to perceive why it was that her uncle had advised her not to open the letter. Yet she read on; for it held her with a sort of fascination. A strange, unaccountable dread  came over her, as, one by one, she laid away the pages her mother's hand had traced. The whole story of that mother's life lay there; and, as Clyde read, she, for the first time, understood much that had seemed strange to her in the past. She knew now why it was that their life had been so secluded--so apart from their relatives, why her father's name had never been mentioned, why Mrs. Bertrand spoke so seldom of her sister's life. She knew, as she read, how hard it must have been for her mother to write all this, know- ing, as she did, that it would be read some day by her only child. And yet for some little time she did not think how this story affected her, till suddenly it all flashed across her, and for the first time she understood why it was that her uncle had wished her to leave it unread,-from what dread it was that he wished to save her; and for the first'time she understood the full meaning of the promise she had given her mother upon her dying-bed. And yet it was not an entire understanding. Not for some little time did the full comprehension of the letter come to her. And then she vainly wished that she had left it unread. The knowledge she had persisted in seeking was for evil and not for good. It haiset Ralph Bertrand and herself even farther apart than before; for it might have been that Nora would   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        257 have released him, but now, even that would be use- less. Clyde had thought her lot hard before, but now it seemed, nay, it was harder to bear than ever; fot added to her other trial, was the dread of one still greater, -the fear of what yet might come,- and she knew that the more she dwelt upon this possible hor- ror, the more probable she made its coming.4 Poor child, slwondered if bowed under the weight of this new burden, she ever could smile again! She wished - oh, so vainly now- that she had burned the letter unread. It seemed so hard that the sins of the parent should be visited upon the innocent child; and she had been, she thought, so happy in her ignorance! With a sudden impulse, as though by destroying those fatal pages she could destroy all recollection of their con- tents, she held them one by one in the bright flame of the gas, watching, waiting till they were reduced t) ashes, wishing she could as easily efface from her mem- ory all recollection of them. She walked up and down her room in painful thought, till the hard beating of her heart warned her that she had tried her strength too much. Then came the same sharp pain that she had felt once or twice before; everything in the room seemed to whirl around her; her head grew dizzy, and she barely managed to stagger to her bed. The next moment, for the first time in her life, Clyde Wardleigh had fainted. 22       - R i . , -    &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7632-00000127"/> 258     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. CHAPTER XXTI.

It might have been for hours - it may only have been for minutes; but she only came to herself suffi- ciently to be conscious that she was awake, and then she fell asleep from pure exhaustion. She did not awaken until the sun was far above the horizon; and the sounds in the house told her that she would scarcely be in time to take her place at the breakfast-table. For a few moments she was sensible of that vague feeling that tells us something, she knew not what, but some- thing very painful, had happened, and she tried to recall what it could be. At first it eluded her thoughts, and then, as she lay still, she wondered how it was that she had not undressed herself; and then, all at once, the events of the preceding evening all came back to her, and she remembered everything. Yet in the clear bright sunshine of the new day, it did not seem quite so hard to bear as in the solitude and darkness of the preceding night. Still, Clyde knew that it was a very great trial- that it would cast a shadow deeper than ever over her future life. But then, it might prove   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        259 only a dread, after all--the fate she feared might never come to her; she had escaped thus far, and she might never lave to endure it at all. Yet the dread was enough; for she could not conceal from herself that some day it might come. However, it seemed to her that it would be easier borne did no one know what she had to endure; that her uncle and aunt would feel better satisfied and happier about her did they think that she was still in ignorance of her mother's secret, and she resolved, at least so far as she could without falsehood, to make her uncle think she had complied with his request. She did not stop to think that she might be as untrue in deeds as in words; but surely it would be a pardonable deceit, prompted by the best of motives -the wish to spare anxiety to those she loved -a concealment which could do no harm; and Clyde had in her brief life borne so much in secret, that it seemed no very great hardship to her to have to endure a little more. Not for one moment did she conceal from herself all that might come. How to bear and live through the present, however, was her first task; time enough to bear the future when it should come. The sound of the first bell roused her from her reverie, if such painful thoughts can be called a reverie. She glanced at her mirror; it was a relief to her to see that the fair face it reflected bore no trace of the storm of feeling through which she had passed. So much the better; it made the task she had assigned herself easier; the part she had to play would not be marred by pale cheeks or heavy eyes.  For this she was  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7632-00000128"/> 260     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. indebted to the deep sleep in which she had lain; and it was with no fear of failure that she dressed herself, carefully, daintily as usual, and joined the family at table, looking as if nothing had happened to' disturb her usual serenity. She exerted herself to converse as cheerfully as ever -to join in the merry chat which, with the bright faces gathered around it, made, Mr. Bertrand declared, his breakfast-table the very pleasantest in the Union. Clyde saw her uncle, as she seated herself, cast an inquiring glance at her, but for this she was prepared, and she met it with such a bright smile that she knew in a moment, by the expression of his face, that his suspicions were lulled, and it would be an easy matter for her to gain her object. Only a word or two would be needed, nothing more, and her uncle would be fully satisfied. Her opportunity came at last. Mr. Bertrand waited until the others had left the room, and then he turned to Clyde with a questioning "Well?" "Must I make full confession " she asked, smiling., "Uncle Bertrand, I hope you will be satisfied when I tell you I burnt that letter last night before I went to bed; and I hope I may never be sorry that I destroyed it. Do you think I shall?" "You have relieved me inexpressibly, Clyde," was her uncle's reply. -"My child, I am very sure you will never regret it, and I think the very best thing we all -can do will be to forget it ever existed." "Then suppose that we agree never to talk of it   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        261 again. That is the surest way of forgetting it," Clyde said, not slow to see the advantage his words gave her. "Agreed,' was the reply, "provided (you promise me that you will not think about it, or what it may have contained. Clyde, there are enough real trials in life, without our troubling ourselves about imaginary ones, which, after all, may never come. You know nothing as yet of what life's troubles and trials can be; you are too young for that as yet. Your sunny face has given me a light heart this morning." "I am glad of that," Clyde answered. "If that be all that is needed to give you pleasure, uncle, I will try always to look bright and cheerful." "Keep a light heart, and the smiles will come with- out trying," Mr. Bertrand said, and there the talk ended. And Clyde knew that he never suspected her; and it was a strange gratification to her to know that the subject was dropped forever. She had thought, when Ralph Bertrand first told her of his engagemlent to Nora Reynolds, that nothing ever could, or would fully reconcile her to her situa- tion. Now, it was a relief to her to think that the choice had not been left to her, and that she had not been compelled to relinquish him of her own act. KInowing what she now did, she was not sorry that the thing had been .settled before this dreary knowledge came to her. For nothing, she said to herself, would now induce her to bind her life to his; and if this blow had come upon her in the full happiness of love, in the midst of that glad dream from which she had  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7632-00000129"/> 262     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. been so soon awakened, it would have been even harder to bear than it was now. She was thankful the deci- sion had passed out of her hands. But even now, Clyde did not forget her good resolu- tions. Sometimes, it is true, she asked herself why it was that her life should have so much less of sunshine, so much more of shadow, than others? but, taking all things into consideration- remembering how much was still left to her she tried hard to be content. It was a blessing to Clyde just now that the wish to save others made her try to forget herself. It kept her from dwelling morbidly upon her troubles, and in endeavoring to be cheerful, she found that these efforts brought in time a cheerfulness which was natural, and not forced. Yet every now and then a longing would come over her to have some one in whom she could place full confidence-who would encourage her- who would help her to bear her burden. It was the natural longing of the woman-heart for support and sympathy, without which life is incomplete and unfin- ished for no matter how strong a woman may be, it is after all only a woman's strength that she possesses, and her whole nature rebels against standing alone.  At times she grew so weary, so tired of herself and of all this trouble. She was just in that mood in which women seek work, in the wish to comfort them- selves by occupation. If she had possessed the ability necessary, she would have resorted to the pen, which perhaps brings more true interest, more real comfort to those who wield it, than anything else; and which   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         263 brings its own reward, in time, to those who succeed; nay, even to those who do not succeed, for it engrosses their thoughts, and interests them in their work ;-but she had neither the talent nor the inclination necessary. Had she been a Romanist, it is more than likely that at this time, in some one of the moods which came over her,. she would have entered a convent, in the vain hope of escaping from herself; only to find, when too late, that she had carried SELF with her into that apparently peaceful retirement. She did what was far better-she tried to forget self; she banished the haunting thoughts which harassed her, so far as she could i and though there were times when she almost thought that the peaceful rest of the grave would be preferable to the constant conflict of feeling in the life she led, yet on the whole she tried to be, and was con- tent; she tried to interest herself, as she had always done, in the little every-day occurrences of life, nd perhaps of the two, Nora and herself, she was the happiest. For there is a certain satisfaction that the knowledge we have at least tried to do right, that we have endeavored to do our duty, brings us; and Clyde had that knowledge with which to console herself. And yet she lived to, and within herself. It was, the same reticence which had influenced her in the early days of her life in her new home - only with this difference: that whereas it then was caused by want of confidence in her relatives, it now arose from, and was prompted by her love for them, and her wish to spare them needless anxiety.  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7632-00000130"/> 264     CLYDE WARDLEIGH.  It had been settled, early in the spring, that Ellen's marriage should take place in the fall. It would make little, of any difference in the house, for both, Mr. and Mrs. Bertrand insisted that the young couple should make their home with them. To this arrangement all were willing to agree, and the necessary preparations, and the bustle attendant upon them, although the occa- sion for it all was several months distant, began to fill up the time and engross the thoughts of the. ladies of the family, while Mr. Bertrand interested himself in some alterations he had long been projecting in the house, and he took advantage of Ellen's approaching marriage as an excuse for' carrying them out. As a matter of course, he carried them farther than he had at first intended. What with the talking things over, the planning and arranging, Clyde's time and thoughts, like those of the others, were fully taken up; and  before many weeks had passed, she was, outwardly at least, her old self. She had played her part well; the others never even guessed at what she had endured- never, dreamed of the long battle which she had fought with herself, and in which she had come off conqueror. Conqueror so far as this, that she was resigned to what seemed inevitable, for "to bear is to conquer our fate." All in secret, too;' so true is it that we may live for years, sharing the same home, the same interests; and yet our lives may/ lie as witely apart, and we 'ay know as little of each otherf'thoughts, feelings, and true selves, as though oceans rolled between us, and re never looked upon one another's faces. Yet it is not   CLYDE WARDLEIG1t,        265 from lack of affection; it is only that a true compre- hension of our differing dispositions does not exist; and so it sometimes happens that those who are nearest in blood are farther removed from us in feeling than strangers. It was not so with Clyde; she was spared this; her friends would gladly have given her their sympathy-would have welcomed her confidence would have helped her, so far as affection and sympa- thy might. But though Clyde knew this, she preferred to endure all silently, and, precious though that love and sympathy would have been, it was better, she thought, to do without it, than to let them think she was unhappy. It seemed to her sometimes as if her life was more like those stories told by the romancer's pen than a sober, stern reality. She had read of such things over and over, never thinking it would some day fall to her lot to live through some of them herself. It was not pleasant, most assuredly, --it was wearing and trying to her. (It was far easier to live through uneventful 'days - happy in their unbroken calm - than to endure this constant storm of emotion Even Clarke Hen- derson's book contained less of incident than now came crowding into her experience. She had read it a second time, with even more interest than at first, because Clarke had told her his heroine was a faint reflection of herself. She could not but see this now, as we see things when we have reached a full compre. - hension of them, though at the time she had laughed at Ellen for her fancied discovery. She did not laughi 23  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7632-00000131"/> 266     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. now; she only laid down the volume, with a half- uttered prayer that if she were in truth like the "Alice" of the story in character, the resemblance might end there, and she might not share the hope- lessness of her final destiny. Clyde had no faith in presentiments, - there was not the slightest degree of superstition about her, -and yet there were times when she almost felt as if Clarke, in writing about her char- acter, had written prophetically about her future. But Clyde had learned that the true way to take life is to live through each day as it comes, bearing what it brings, and not troubling one's self about the cares and trials of the morrow. At least, she tried to live thus, and, in trying, was content. It was, after all, true wisdom, -the knowing that which before us lies in daily life. Yet no thought of any special wisdom on her part ever crossed Clyde's mind. It was only that she saw the duty that lay before her for each day, and, seeing it, tried to do it; it was only that she remembered and endeav- ored to obey and fulfil the precept, "Take no thought unto the morrow." But with the oppressive, weakening heats of July there came a new source of anxiety to Clyde. She might well, as she did in her thoughts, call this sum- mer a battle summer," -so many conflicts had come to her. The sharp pain which had startled her on the night on which she had read her mother's letter had returned once or twice, each time after some unusual exertion or excitement; and at last Clyde determined   CLYDE WARDLE-IGH.       267 that she would consult a physician. It could do no harm, she thought; he might probably be able. to do her good. And so, without saying a word to any one, she went one day to Dr. Lewis's office. It was at an hour, when she was sure of finding him there; and it was with no little surprise that he lis- tened to the story she had to tell him. He hesitated for a moment before he answered her. "Do they know this at home?" he asked. No," was Clyde's answer. "The truth is, doctor, that I did not want to make them uneasy, and, as you see, I was brave enough 'to come to you of my own accord, and ask you what could be the matter with me." "If you were a nervous, fidgety thing, with no self- control, like some young ladies of my acquaintance, I would not tell you," he said. "But you are old enough and wise enough to take care of yourself, Clyde, and you will not be frightened if I examine you." He put a few questions to her,-but he shook his head at her answers. You will have to be careful, that is all. You say that these attacks only come on after any exertion. Then all you have to do is to avoid excitement, I don't say this for anything but a slight warning, Clyde; but you must avoid excitement if you want to live to be an old woman. Better for nine-tenths of the wo- men of the present day if they would remember and follow out that prescription." "Then you think my situation dangerous?"Clyde  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7632-00000132"/> 268     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. asked, slightly paler than she had been before. "Tell me the whole truth, Dr. Lewis, whatever it is; I can bear it better than uncertainty." "You need not look so frightened," he said, quietly. "Your heart is affected, though not very seriously, and you may - aye, probably will - live to be a very old woman, and finally die of something else. You have everything in your favor,--youth and a good constitu- tion,-only you will have to take care of yourself. The best advice I can give you is never to think of it. You are not worse off than any one else in the world. Your chances for a long life are as good as those of any other young lady I know." "Then you really think I need not be uneasy about myself?" "There are ninety-nine chances for you to one against you. If you will avoid all violent exertion, all great excitement, I should say you have no more reason than any one else to feel uneasy about your- self." "And what am I to do?" "Nothing. If you find yourself getting low-spir- ited, don't give way to it; try to be cheerful. Don't think of yourself or dwell upon the fact that your heart indulges in a few Vagaries occasionally. If you can forget the existence of that organ altogether, so much the better for you and for it. People often make themselves worse by dwelling upon their petty ail- ments. Imagination goes a great way in such matters. The very best remedy for you would be. matrimony,- Olt   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        269 on the homeopathic principle, that one affection drives out another." He shook hands with her, laughingly, as he spoke. He had known her mother in her girlish days, and for years had been the Bertrands' physician ; and, conse- quently, Clyde had full confidence in him. She went home, feeling much relieved, although she was some- what surprised at the jesting way il which he had spoken. He had not wished to alarm her. What he had told her was, indeed, the truth; she might-and, prob- ably, would - live to be an old woman. But if she ever allowed her strength to run down -if she over- tasked herself- if she indulged in any very violent emotion, eithbr of joy or sorrow-one sharp, sharp pain might come, and the young life would be over. It was only a possibility, Dr. Lewis knew, and so he had not considered it necessary to tell Clyde anything more. He might, after all, be mistaken; and while the chances were so greatly in her favor, there was no -use troubling her with the anticipation of an evil which might never come. He knew that the fear of such things often hastens their coming, and so he had sent Clyde home with her mind at rest. He had very few fears himself for the result; he did not wish her to feel any. 283   &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7632-00000133"/> 270     CLYDE WARDLEIGI-o CHAPTER XXTII. A NEW ORDER OF THNGS. "Love can hope where reason would despair.", HE first of August brought Clarke Henderson home from his summer wanderings.  He had started upon them with the hope that he would find forgetfulness. He learned that it was a search as fruitless as that which in olden times was made for the island of St. Brandon, or the fabled city and em- pire of Prester John. In the old mythology the story which has most charm to most of us is the story which tells of the river Lethe, - one draught from whose cold waves blotted out all recollections of the past; and there are but few of us who would not, at times, were we only allowed, gladly drink from its waters. To Clyde, to Ralph Bertrand, to Clarke Henderson, it would have been the first thing to be desired; it would have added to their happiness. Yet it was denied to each of them. Of the three, Ralph, perhaps, suffered least, not because he was wanting in sensibility, - if the word be applicable here, - but he had the power of throwing himself into his work. He lived a life of action, Clarke one of feeling; there lay the differ- ence between the two men. Bertrand's business was increasing; his profession was one which required close study and attention. And it is not surprising that   CLYDE WARDLEIGII.        271 he sometimes, in the many demands upon his time, thoughts, and attention, forgot the disappointment of his hopes. Not so with Clarke. Nora saw, and saw with pain, that Clyde's refusal of him, and his' absence from her, had not cured him of his love for her. She for- got that with Clarke it was a thing of no late date; it had been a boy's fancy, which had grown and strengthened into a man's love, with, strange to say, a woman's constancy. Nora had hoped-had, indeed, expected that, refused by Clyde, Clarke would seek consolation, like most others of his fickle sex, else- where. She had anticipated no difficulty, if any, in winning, him; but on his return she found that she had gained nothing,-that he was still true to his first love,-and a feeling of jealousy, more intense than ever, grew up in her heart against Clyde, while the wish to win Clarke, and the desire to free herself from Ralph Bertrand, grew stronger than before. She knew well enough that honor alone bound the latter to her. Most women would have cared nothing for a hand thus given; but Nora was determined that if she lost her love, her pride should not suffer. So matters stood, when one day she received a note from Ralph. It only contained a few formal lines; it merely stated that he was compelled to leave the city, on business, for a few days, but that he would see her on his return. Ralph Bertrand never forgot what was outwardly due to the woman who had said she loved him, who would one day be his wife. He was scru-  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7632-00000134"/> 272     CLYDE  WARDLEIGH. pulously observant of everything that could be re- quired of him. If he could not give Nora love for love, he felt all the more bound to try and please her, -even more, btcause he knew that he would give much to be free. On Nora these bonds lay with equal heaviness. She knew that before very long, if ever, her engagement must end in marriage, and how to postpone it she scarcely knew. She began to think that in separating Clarke and Clyde she had built up an equally impass- able barrier between her cousin and herself; for even had Clarke loved her, he would have as soon thought of confessing it to a married'as to an engaged woman. No word had ever passed his lips that she could inter- pret according to her wishes; but she did not yet de- spair. Ralph's absence gave her an opportunity by which she determined to profit, and she lost no time in laying her plans. She knew well enough that Clarke considered Clyde's rejection as final, and that he would not trouble her again with solicitations as painful to both as they were useless. As he had once said to her, Clyde's "no" meant "no," and he preferred being her valued friend and brother to the part of a persistent and annoying lover. Nora still held two cards in her hand which she had not played. She determined to play them now. One was to give Clarke the knowledge--which had not yet come to him - that the true reason and motive for Clyde's rejection of him lay in the fact that she loved another; the second was, to let him see that   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        273 the love one had rejected might be prized by another and valued as the crowning happiness of her life. It must be done delicately, else -she might shock him; but Nora knew what she could do, and she had too much confidence in her own powers to shrink from the undertaking. She knew well enough - for she had often done it before - how to manage a conversation so as to lead it into the channels she desired, and to draw it on, step by step and word by word, until all that she wished to hear had been spoken. It is not a very honorable thing to do, to be sure; but selfish and de- signing people are not often troubled with thoughts as to whether the means they employ be honorable or not, so long as they gain their ends, and present a fair appearance to the world. And yet Nora shrank a little from this, her last and greatest effort. No matter what she was, or what she felt, there still lingered in her heart some true woman- liness, - some of that feeling which makes a woman shrink from doing anything which takes her out of her sphere or infringes on man's privileges;-and she hoped that Clarke would spare her the necessity of betraying herself. If she failed; but, no! she would not allow herself to think of that. It was against Nora's principles ever to look upon the gloomy side of things; she hated the thought of suffering, and every fibre of her self-indulgent nature rebelled against it. She only allowed herself to think of the happi- ness of success. S  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7632-00000135"/> 274     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. "Providence helps those who help themselves," was the motto Nora had taken for her own, and so far, she had found it true. She only hoped it would continue to hold good. If she could but win Clarke, she would try to be such a good wife; she would try so hard to please everybody, and to win golden opinions from all, even from Clyde, by resigning Bertrand to her. Even in this Nora was true to herself; her good resolutions lay on that foundation: first, to please herself, by gaining her own ends; that being accomplished, she might try to please others, but only on that one con- dition. But what she had to do, if it were done at all, must be doneequickly. Her parents did not approve of long engagements, and she knew well enough that Mr. Ber- trand expected an early day to be appointed for their marriage. Nothing could have pleased her better than his absence at this time. She had no wish that her pro- jected interview with Clarke should be interrupted by his inopportune entrance; it relieved her from all anxiety on that subject. Clarke had resumed his old habit of spending the twilight hours with Nora, and the very evening of the day on which she received BertraL:'d's note she resolved to carry her plans into execution. "I hope you have nothing to do this evening, Clarke," she said to him, as the two went out upon the piazza. She seated herself in a low chair as she spoke; she knew how very effective a certain careless   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        275 grace of attitude can be - how suggestive of rest and  quiet; she knew too, that her white dress, flecked here and there with scarlet, was very becoming. "For I expect to be alone, and I want you to relieve me from my own society." "Where is Bertrand?" Out of town ;-beyond that I can tell you nothing." "Don't he tell you where he is going?" For all reply she tossed him the note she had that morning received. He went to the window of the parlor to read it. "Rather a formal note, considering circumstances," he said, as he handed it back to her. "Scarcely the sort of note I should expect a man in love to write. However, Bertrand is not a demonstrative fellow. Nora, are you ready to demolish me for that speech?" "No," she said, "I have no wish to demolish any- thing except this scrap of paper," tearing it up and throwing away the pieces as she spoke. "Is that the way you treat your love-letters?" Clarke asked, carelessly. "I thought you girls treas- ured them up, all tied together with a blue ribbon, in neat packages, and read and kissed them until they were worn out, or nearly so." "I don't, for one," Nora replied. "I hope you don't think me a silly, sentimental girl, Clarke; there is nothing I try harder to avoid." "On the contrary, Nora, I think you a very sensi- ble woman. I am sure I have given you enough proofs that I think so."  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7632-00000136"/> 276     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. "And yet you withhold the best, most convincing proof you could give me that you really thought so well of me." "And that is- what?  "Don't ask me, Clarke; for if you cannot guess what it is without my telling you, you will never know it." "You are dealing in mysteries, Nora." "Mysteries very easily solved if you choose to look carefully for their solution. Let it pass for the present. Clarke, may I ask you one question?" "A thousand, if you like." "But you will answer it?" "If I can, most certainly." She laid her hand on his arm. "Clarke, did you ever--forgive my bringing up the subject--but did you ever ask Clyde why it was that she rejected you?" "Why do you bring that up now, Nora?" he asked, getting up and pacing the long piazza somewhat impa- tiently. "Why? for a very good reason, Clarke, which I will tell you presently; only, first answer my ques- tion." "I have not seen her since, Nora; I did not ask her at the time why she refused me. I supposed it was, as she said, because she did not love me." "In part - not wholly; there was another reason." "'What other reason could there be? I do not understand you, Nora." "Perhaps I can make you understand," she said,   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        2" quietly, "when I tell you, Clarke, that her true reason was, she loved another." "How do you know?" lie asked, stopping abruptly before her. "You have no right to say so, Nora, no reason to say so." I have the best rsason for saying so, Clarke, the most certain knowledge of the fact. You must not ask me how I know it; though I can even tell you who is the fortunate possessor of the lady's heart." "You are surely jesting, Nora'! Yet you would scarcely jest to me on this subject. Your words are enigmas." "Yet they are easy, very easy of solution. Oh, Clarke, Clarke, love ought to have made you clear- sighted; it only blinded you!" "Only in this way, Nora," he said, quietly. "Until you spoke, I did not know that there was some little hope left; I did not know that; I thought time might possibly bring a change, and some day I might win Clyde. I know now that I never shall." "Then why waste your thoughts upon' her, Clarke? Can you not seek consolation elsewhere?" "Oh, what do you know of the unhappiness of love, or how it engrosses you, Nora?" he asked, bitterly. "You, secure of your lover - happy in your love - how do you know what it is to love, and to learn your love is not returned, and yet, through it all, to love on, hopelessly, unable to conquer your feelings? If you knew, you would not ask me such a question." "If I knew! Clarke! Clarke! you men are such 24  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7632-00000137"/> 278     CLYDE -WARD LEIG H. poor judges of us women. You only look upon the calm surface; you never think of the hidden depths below!. You are both stronger and weaker than-we are- wiser, and yet less wise; wiser as to the world, less wise as to the heart. The best and wisest man living never yet fully comprehended--never will comprehend a woman! And we, we, more clear- sighted, we must wait to be chosen! If only the liberty of choosing for ourselves were left us, our lives would indeed shape themselves differently from the way they do." He looked at her in surprise. "Nora, what am I to understand from all this? Can it be possible that you do not love Ralph Bertrand?" She hesitated, but only for a moment; she had gone too far to recede. Falsehood would not help her now; all that she needed, all that she could possibly need, was the bare simplicity of the truth and the truth alone; that would be enough, and more than enough. Her answer came slowly. "If I tell you that Clyde Wardleigh loves him, and has won him away from me--that he knows of and returns that love, is it notsufficient answer?" She waited impatiently for him to speak. He was silent for a few minutes - perhaps from surprise; and then his tones were very different from what she had expected. "And, knowing this, you can stand between them and separate them! Nora, Nora, I had expected better things of you!"   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        279 She was stung to the quick by his evident forgetful- ness of her - by his thinking only of Clyde. Yet she loved him -women are strange contradictions- all the better that he had forgotten himself to rebuke her. "What is Clyde to me, Clarke, that I should think of her? Do not let us speak of her now; I had rather speak only of ourselves. . If it will please you, why, let Clyde take her lover if she will; he is nothing to me." "Nora!" he exclaimed.   "What does all this mean?" '( What does it mean? Cannot you see for yourself that I do not love Ralph Bertrand; that I would gladly be free; because, like him - and that is why I can forgive him so easily for his neglect of me - I love another." And her voice melted into a deep ten- derness as she spoke these words. "Then, Nora, release him at once. It may be that the knowledge of your engagement is all that deters that other from seeking you," Clarke said, strangely moved by her tone. "Your love would be a precious gift and blessing to any one; you cannot be destined to unhappiness. Nora, it is scarcely the question for me- to ask, but if I can help you in any way; if I could only know -" "Clarke," she whispered, beneath her breath, " do you really care to know? You, more than any one else, can help me. Listen. Would you think the gift one worth taking? Cannot you understand me now? will  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7632-00000138"/> 280     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. you force me to say more?" and she laid her hand upon his arm as she spoke. Nora, this is indeed reversing the usual order of things," he said, his whole manner changing. "We men would rather do the asking ourselves. No, my poor cousin," as she turned abruptly away, I did not mean to reproach you - nothing was further from my thoughts. I should rather, for I cannot pretend to misunderstand you-I should rather thank you for your good opinion of me, and tell you how much I value and prize my sister's love. Let me be as I have always been, your brother, Nora; what you have said to me is sacred. Only," he added in a lower tone, but she heard it, though he had not intended it, "far bet- ter had it never been spoken!" "And why not?" she asked, eagerly. "Clarke, fit is no sin onu my part, no wrong thing in me to love you! I have done so much with this hope before me, I would yet do so much. It was for this that I threw Ralph and Clyde together, hoping they would learn to love one another. Must she be happier than I, who have helped, who am willing to give her this happi- ness? Must I, because I did not wait for you to speak, be condemned to misery? Whatever my faults may have been towards others, Clarke, the only fault I have committed towards you is this bending and for- getting of my woman's pride, for your sake. Surely, surely you can forgive me this, because I love you dearly?" "Can you ever forgive yourself, Nora? a he asked,   CLYDE WARDLEIGtH.       281 seriously. "You have placed me in a most awkward position. I do not know what to say to you; I wish I did!" "I have nothing to forgive myself," she said. "Clarke, I am not ashamed of loving you; why should I be? If only you will love me, you may do what you will with me. I will follow your advice implicitly."  "But, Nora, do you realize what you have done?" "What have I done?  Nothing!  Clarke, I ask you what I am yet to do - cannot you tell me?" "Yes," he said, with some reluctance. "But, Nora, you may not like my advice. First, you should not lose one moment in releasing Bertrand; you ought to have done it long ago."  "I know I ought," she said, eagerly, "and I will do it at once. And then, Clarke, if I do this, will you not -" she paused, but there was no need for her to say more. "I cannot but understand you, Nora," he said, unwillingly. "I wish I could think I was mistaken; but it would not be fair for me to tell you anything but the truth. There must be perfect candor between us now, though indeed I scarcely know what to say to you. I care more for Clyde's happiness than for my own.  I know that in advising and urging you to release Bertrand, I am separating her most effectually from myself; yet, Nora, I know that I love her still, as I never can, never shall love another. Nora, my cousin, I am proud to know you think me worthy of 24 *  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7632-00000139"/> 282     CLYDE WARDLEIGTH. your love, but I like you too well - I care too much for my cousin to give her, in return for all she would give me - a cold heart."  "But the other feeling may come in time," she pleaded. "Clarke, you will not despise me- you will not pain me so deeply as to say - no?" a "Nora, is this womanly?" was his only answer. "I do not care whether it be womanly or not," was her reply, annoyed as she was at his gentle remon- strance. "Clarke, have you not even one kind word for me?" "Is it not the truest kindness I can show you, when I ask you for your own sake to do what is right, and beg of you to forget all this as I intend doing! Nora, my cousin, my dear sister! let us consider this conver- sation as never having taken place; it will be better for both of us!" He was about to leave her, but she detained him. "Clarke, had Clyde spoken as I have done, would you have given her the same answer you have given me?" The answer came very reluctantly. ' She would not have done this, Nora." He was sorry for her the moment he had;-spoken. He knew it was the severest rebuke he could have given her; for she shrank from him as though he had struck her. "Go!" was all she said. "You have said enough, Clarke. I do not care to have you tell me more plainly that you despise me."   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        283 "Despise you, Nora! Far from it. :I can only ask you to forgive me." He bent down and took her hand. She raised her eyes to his, pleadingly. He hesitated for a moment, then he kissed her brow and was gone. CHAPTER XXIV. CLYDE S RESOLUTION. "Till at length the burden seems Greaser than our strength can bear." UPON the whole, Nora was not altogether dissatis- fied with the result of her conversation with Clarke. In fact, he had not said positively that they were parted forever, - that it would be impossible for him to think of her as she wished, - and he had even thanked her for her love for him. Nora knew that familiarity with anything, and constant dwelling upon one idea, sometimes makes it absolutely essential to our happiness and comfort, and she was willing to trust to time to bring Clarke, by slow degrees, to her way of thinking. But to do this, and to please him, she must first follow his advice. With the hope of gratifying him before her, this was an easy thing to do, more especially when it coincided with her own inclinations. It was not difficult, therefore, for her to decide at once upon removing what now seemed the  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7632-00000140"/> 284     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. chief obstacle in her way, her engagement to Ralph Bertrand. She waited for a day or two, and then she wrote to him. She told him that, after all, she had concluded they would be happier apart; that she was sincerely sorry that she had been so much mistaken about the true nature of her own feelings as she had been at the time when he had requested his release; and she ended her note by saying that while she wished him all possible happiness with Clyde, she hoped to be counted among their truest friends. Then she wrote to Clarke to tell him what she had done, and, sealing and directing the two notes, she dropped them into one of the nearest letter-boxes. She wrote to her cousin, because, after his summer's journey, he had, instead of returning to the house, taken rooms at one of the hotels. By a not uncommon accident, however, Nora had misdirected her notes. So far as Clarke was concerned, it did not matter; for, supposing that she had wished to submit it to him for his approval, he read it, and then forwarded it to its real owner. In fact, it was rather in Nora's favor that the mistake had happened; her cousin was pleased with what he considered her delicacy in taking this method of informing him of what she had done,-and it aided materially in lessen- ing and removing the intense annoyance which her betrayal of her true feelings towards him, a few even- ings previous, had caused him, and made him feel gratified by her ready compliance with his advice. In consequence, when Bertrand returned to the city,   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        285 he found the two notes awaiting him. By a mere acci- dent, the one bearing Nora's handwriting was the first he opened. He read it through before he fully un- derstood that it had never been intended for his eye. He had been a, little surprised at Nora's writing to him, but its contents still further surprised him. They were only a few lines. 'I have written, as you advised me, to Mr. Ber- trand, releasing him. If only I had done it long ago! You may judge from this how willing I am to make all the amends iln my power,--to do what is really right! Will you not, in time, forgive me, though I can scarcely forgive myself? I Ao not wonder now at your surprise. Forgive, but do not forget me, Clarke!                NORA." He read the note twice before he understood it--be- fore he saw that it was not for himself. It referred, evidently, to another note, which had been written to him. He-tore the other open hastily, and it was with sincere thankfulness that he read that he at last was free - honorably free from an engagement which had in truth been painful to him, -free at last to seek his true happiness. But how was it that he had received the other note? It was not intended for him, that was very evident-as evident as that in some way, though how he knew not, he was indebted to Clarke for his release. He saw that the first note had been really intended for Clarke -that it never was meant to meet his eyes. He read, in  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7632-00000141"/> 286     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. its careful wording, that some secret, lay between the two. It was but a slight clue, to be sure; but it was enough. A word will sometimes tell a lawyer vol- umes, and he knew, from Nora's note, that she loved Clarke. He wondered if Clarke returned it, or if he still admired Clyde; but he was too grateful for his newly-acquired freedom to care very much how it had come to him, yet he scarcely knew what to do with the stray billet which had taken him behind the scenes. His first impulse was to enclose it to Clarke, his second to return it to Nora. The second was obeyed. That very afternoon Clarke wrote to Nora - only a line or two-saying that he approved fully of the note submitted to him, and that he had forwarded it, as he supposed she desired, to Bertraud. At the same time she received Ralph's enclosure. He little guessed how well he had played into Nora's hands, and what' a re- lief it was for her to learn that chance or fortune had done more for her than she had done for herself. She had no fear of anything being told; the two men she had to deal with were both of them honorable gentle- men, and she had no fear of their comparing notes, as women so often do. Nora knew that her secret was as safe in their keeping as in her own. Neither of them would ever know that the other had learned it. And Clarke tried hard to reconcile himself to the fact that he and Clyde were parted forever. As he had said to Nora, he had still hoped - it was scarcely hope, to be sure, but he could not help thinking that in the future there might be some slight chance of   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.         287 success for him. This faint glimmer of light, which had been the charm of the " to come," was now extin- guished. He could now only strive to reconcile him- self to his fate, to bear it and meet it as a man should. But while Clarke was thus struggling against the feelings which rose up to tell him that, although his own act, his own advice had secured Clyde's happiness, he could not yet think calmly of what he himself had lost,--Ralph Bertrand was giving himself up to the full enjoyment of the bright hopes and happy dreams he had been so long compelled to deny himself. In his present gratitude to Nora, he could forgive her all the past; he never once thought of betraying her; he suspected the truth, but he was willing to keep his suspicions to himself, and to let the future mould itself for her as it would. He was free, and that was enough. I-e felt, it is true, that he was not wholly blameless himself. He thought that it was in part owing to his silence about the truth that some of this trouble had come upon him.  He was determined that this time his conduct should be only what was fair and open, and he decided that before he sought Clyde, his uncle ought to know the whole story. But it was late before he could carry this out. It seemed to him that his time had never been so much taken up as it was that September afternoon. It was dark before he could leave his office, and before he was at liberty to seek his uncle's house. Once there, it was easy for him to obtain a private interview. He, laid the whole story before Mr. Ber-  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7632-00000142"/> 288     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. trand, generously sparing Nora where he could, taking most blame to himself, and winding up by asking his uncle, as Clyde's guardian, for permission and sanction to win her. "It was scarcely necessary to ask it, Ralph," Mr. Bertrand said to him, as he grasped the young man's hand. "We shall hate to give Clyde up, but it must have come, sooner or later, and I wish you all success. I can give her unhesitatingly to you." And I may see her?" "You may go to her at once. She and Ellen are in the parlor - you know the way - go to them." He needed no second bidding. Ellen and Clyde sat by the window in the moon- light-the clear September moonlight, which made other light unnecessary. They had been talking about the wedding, which was to take place early in Novem- ber, and in their earnest conversation they were wholly unconscious of Ralph Bertrand's presence. He had hesitated' about interrupting them, and indeed the picture was almost too pretty to be de- stroyed. At no time does a pretty woman look prettier than under the soft rays of the moon; and although Ellen's beauty, as she sat there, wassomething striking, Bertrand scarcely glanced at her, his eyes were fixed on Clyde. Her soft white dress fell airily around her; her beautiful violet eyes had a strange, shadowy depth in the moonlight; the fair face seemed fairer in its pensiveness than ever--that sweet pansy face, which Ralph Bertrand hoped would yet be the light of his home, the blessing of his life.   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        289 They saw him at last, induced to look around by that strange magnetism which makes us conscious of the presence of others, even though we may think our- selves alone. Ellen's welcome was eagerly spoken- Clyde's came more slowly - it was the first time they met since that painful evening in April, the recol- lection of which came back to her so vividly at the sight of Bertrand's face. He thought of it, too, but thankfully, that it was all over and past. He only touched Clyde's hand -he clasped Ellen's cordially, but an undefinable something in his manner told his cousin that her presence was not needed - that there were words trembling on Ralph'stips which were only intended for Clyde's ear; and as soon as she could, she quietly withdrew and joined her parents. She knew she would not be missed. And so the two lovers, long parted, were left together. Ralph Bertrand did not long delay the telling of his story. Clyde listened, and in the sudden, intense hap- piness of that moment all else was forgotten; she only remembered her love and her lover, and when he left her, after those two short hours, which in their rapid', flight had seemed like moments, so swiftly had they passed, she "Wore a troth-kiss on her lips." Ellen, coming to her room that night, looked in to bid Clyde good-night. She sat by the window, look- ing out upon the calm stars, but never seeing them, and dreaming such happy dreams. So completely did her f2.5       T  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7632-00000143"/> 290     CLYDE WARDLEIGH, thoughts engross her that Ellen had crossed the room and come to her side unnoticed, and she was wholly unconscious of her cousin's presence until the latter laid her hand upon her arm. Then she raised her eyes, soft, dewy, and beaming with love's purple glory, and in them Ellen read the truth. She stooped to kiss Clyde's fair brow. "Ellen, did you guess it - do you know how happy I am?" "I can read it in your eyes, dear Clyde. God bless and make my cousin happy!"   Then, playfully, "You have changed, sister mine. I can remember when Clyde Wardleigh would not bear our name. Time works wonders as it passes; she will be Clyde Bertrand yet." A sudden change came across the fair face; the peaceful joy it wore faded. With the exclamation, "Heaven help me, I had forgotten-!" she turned away from Ellen, and burst into a flood of bitter tears. Completely mystified, Ellen knelt beside her, en- treating her to speak to her - imploring forgiveness had she unknowingly caused her pain. Clyde weep- ing! Clyde, who never shed tears! But at last she checked them sufficiently to say: "It is not your fault, Ellen!" and then the paroxysm of grief swept over her again. It spent itself in time, and then, clinging to her cousin, she whispered: "Ellen, did I frighten you? It was only that I had forgotten my fate for a moment--one happy moment - had forgotten the weighty burden laid upon   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        291 my weak shoulders. Ellen, help me to bear it- help me to endure! Ralph Bertrand and I must part!" "Clyde!" was the surprised exclamation, "surely you are dreaming! What is there to part you now, unless our name be repulsive to you?" "Do I look as if I were dreaming?" looking up at Ellen with a face from which every particle of color, had faded. No, Ellen, it is not the name," she went on, shuddering, "I would only be too glad to bear it, but I dare not; it would be the same with any one." Ellen continued: "But Ralph loves you, Clyde; his whole heart is yours. Will you reject that noble gift, which any woman might be proud to win-proud to accept? Will you blight his whole life? Tried as he has been, will you make him suffer more? Will you rend your own heart? Will you -" The pale lips quivered. "Ellen, it is the very depth of my love for Ralph which helps to part us. Listen to me. Do you not think that I care more for his happiness than for my own? Do you not know that I would first consult his welfare? Do you know my mother's story--my mother, whose name you bear? You do not. Would you have me condemn him to the agony she endured - the death in life-the self-same misery? God help me- never!  Ellen looked at her in amazement. Clyde was ter- ribly agitated, and never before had she voluntarily mentioned her mother. She went on, hurriedly:  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7632-00000144"/> 292     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. Ellen, my father died- a raving maniac I There was insanity to be dreaded; that was why the marriage was opposed so violently. And knowing this, as I do -knowing that his blood runs in my veins- that I have inherited his features, not my mother's, not my mother's; knowing this, do you wonder that on her deathbed she, my mother, made me promise, un- knowing, poor child, what it meant, that I would not marry. I Know now, Ellen, and never will I entail the curse which may fall on me upon innocent children. I must bear the penalty of the past, but it shall not descend through my means to others. I inflict upon no man the curse of an insane wife - least of all upon one whom I love. My promise must be kept, let it cost me what it will. My secret is yours now, Ellen; you know now why your words surprised me; they recalled my promise, for a time forgotten; they reminded me of my duty. Yet it is almost more than I can bear." "Clyde, my poor girl, is this kind to Ralph?" "It is the truest kindness! Do you think I shall tell him all -appeal to his generosity, his pity? N1o; he had better blame me for a few days, and call me heartless; unfeeling, than, giving up to his feelings, bear in consequence a lifelong burden of dread." "Is this right, Clyde?"Ellen asked. Will you not let him decide for himself? Leave the choice to him. Clyde, Clyde, let me entreat you!" "Does not my own heart plead earnestly enough for him, for myself?"Clyde asked. "Do not urge me,   CLYDE WXRDLEIGH.        293 Ellen, I cannot. My promise to my dying mother must be sacredly kept. What I fear may never come - God grant it may not. Your father and mother do not know that I am aware of what may await me," shrinkingly. "No, Ellen, you should rather encour- age me to do my duty, hard enough as it already is. I shall give myself- it cannot be wrong - one day to remember; one day's happiness, no more; and then back to my old life once more, to take up my cross again, if only it do not prove too heavy for me to bear - if only it do not crush me under its weight." And Ellen could not urge her further. She had never dreamed that sorrow like this could fall upon Clyde; she could not add to her trial by her entreaties. They shared one couch that night. Once Clyde's half restrained sobs roused Ellen to say: "Clyde, have you no pity for yourself? And if none for yourself, have you none for Ralph?" -Her only reply: "Would you make my cross heavier?" Can such seasons be described? No! In view of them the mightiest, ablest pen loses its power and skill. Our bitterest, most agonizing sufferings cannot be described either by pen or pencil. The dncient artist showed true wisdom, when, painting the sacrifice of Iphigenia, he, knowing he could not do justice to the father's grief, veiled the face of Agamemnon in his mantle. From the intensity of grief human art turns away, alike powerless to describe or to depict it. 25 *  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7632-00000145"/> 294     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. CHAPTER XXV. AFTER STORM-CALM. "Only one for the bridal pearls, The robe of satin and Brussels lace; Only one to blush through her curls At the sight of her lover's face. "Oh, beautiful Madge, in your bridal white, For you the revel has just begun; But for her who slept in your arms last night The revel of life is done!" THE   morning dawned at last. It had been a long, long night to the two cousins -almost endless it seemed to both. Ellen looked at Clyde in surprise; no one ever would have guessed how stormily the hours had passed for her.  Others would have seen no change.- But Ellen had been with her; she saw the (faint shade under her eyes, which, though it deepened their beauty, told of her agitated night, while the slight drooping of the corners of her mouth betrayed that she had not forgotten. For Clyde had striven for calmness, remembering that her day of happiness was to be shared by another. Not for an instant, strong though the temptation was, did she change her determination, or evei hlesi- tate about it. Frail, delicate, flower-like though she was, there was in her that spirit which, for the sake of the right, carried men to the stake, and enabled   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        295 weak women to bear themselves bravely under the pangs of martyrdom. One day's happiness!-that, Clyde had promised herself. Ellen watched her, fearing it was but poor happiness. Knowing, as she did, what the morrow held in store, she thought it seemed only like a day's respite, such as comes sometimes to a sentenced crimi- nal on the eve of his execution. But to Ralph Ber- trand that fair September day, spent, as it was, by Clyde's side, held the full realization of all his dreams. It was in truth a day of happiness to him. And Ellen watched her cousin all through the day with a strange anxiety which she remembered after- wards. Never had Clyde been so dear to her before. She, and she only, saw the slight contraction of the fair brow which crossed it at times, the occasional close setting of the lips; and although she knew Clyde thought little of her that day, - though Robert Haynes was with her,-her mind was full of her cousin. Clyde's thoughts were with Ralph, and with Ralph only, It was a bright September day, such as sometimes comes to us - hot, calm, unclouded -a glorious day, yet a day for whose dying Ellen fairly longed. If only it were over! She could do nothing that day; her lips were sealed. The morrow might enable her to prove to Clyde that her sacrifice would be needless. How, she did not know; but she only hoped! She feared the trial for Clyde; and yet she hoped that Ralph's pleadings might have some effect.  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7632-00000146"/> 296     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. The day came to its death at last, in rich colors of the western sky, where the sun had painted the clouds gorgeously. But the rich hues soon faded under the swift-coming darkness of the early twilight, all the more rapidly that from the east the heavy masses of a thunder-cloud were rising; and by the time Ellen and Clyde came into the parlor, after their evening toi- lette, it was so dark that the gas had been lighted, in the wish to make less visible the painfully flickering glean of the lightning-flashes, and every few mo- ments there came the threatening, reverberating roll of thunder. Clyde had dressed herself in white, witli the usual knots of heliotrope-flowers clustering in her curls and at her throat. Mingled with them were dark purple pansies, rivalling in their royal color the deep hue of her lovely eyes, and in' the dampness of the air, at every step she took, the rich odor of the heliotrope floated like incense around her. Ellen's eyes never left her cousin. She noticed that every now and then Clyde's hand was pressed to her heart, as though to still its beatings. She wondered why, for there was a soft rose on her cheeks rarely seen there. She was restless and uneasy, it seemed, and yet she talked on gayly aa ever,---smiling on her lover, jesting with her uncle and aunt, answering Haynes's sallies with equal brightness,- till Ellen wondered at her powers of acting, her wonderful self-control. She did not know that Clyde's life had been one long les- son of endurance, her chief study that of concealment of her feelings. Once, she paused near Ellen's chair.   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        297 With a sudden impulse the latter asked, touching the flowers Clyde wore: What are you doing with a widow's-flowers?" She was sorry the moment the words had passed her lips. Such a weary look as came over the fair face! She bent down and murmured in Ellen's ear: "It is worse even than widowhood! If I were only dead!" Another moment, and she and Ralph were by the window, watching the storm, which was now at its height. Ellen asked herself how Clyde could put away the cup of happiness offered to her lips, how she could deny it, not only to herself, but to her lover, who stood beside her, never thinking what the morrow would bring to him. They stood together, Clyde and Ralph, conversing in a low tone of voice. Suddenly a strange pallor came over her face, her hand sought her heart, and the next moment she would have fallen but that Ralph Bertrand caught her in his arms. The storm was at its height, -the thunder rolled incessantly, shaking the house, the lightning's lurid flashes came and went with scarcely a moment's inter-. mission, the rain poured down in torrents; yet it was never remembered or noticed. There was but one thought in the minds of all, and that thought was Clyde! But nothing could be done. The stretched heart- strings could bear no more. Her last uttered wish  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7632-00000147"/> 298     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. was granted: she was dead! Death himself had come to help her keep the promise which, given by the mother's death-bed, found its fulfilment in the daugh- ter's death! She had dressed herself to meet her lover, never knowing she had decked herself to meet her bride- groom - Death! They never touched her save to lay fresh flowers on the calm breast. In her soft, white dress, unchanged, they laid her in her coffin. Of the grief for her, of the tears shed for her, who can speak? To Nora Reynolds Clyde's death came like a thun- derbolt. She blamed herself in her own thoughts when they told her that it was caused by disease of the heart, aggravated by strong excitement. Her con- science told her that she might have spared Clyde much, that it was to her that Clyde owed the chief trial of her life. It was too late now, too late; but as long as Nora Reynolds lives, she will never forget the pang of remorse she felt when she learned that she would never look upon Clyde Wardleigh's living face again. To Clarke Henderson it was almost easier to bear the knowledge of her death, to know whose cold arms enfolded her, than it would have been to have given her up to her successful lover. He did not soon forget her, but he turned for comfort to his pen, and wrote; this time a book which was full of a light, airy gayety,   CLYDE WARDLEIGH.        299 in strange contrast with the mournful tenor of his first work. He wrote it, as he told Bertrand, because he was sad; his happy life, by very force of contrast, had inspired his earlier volume; but this one was written in something of the same spirit which prompts us to laugh and jest, though our hearts be breaking. And yet, though he deeply felt Clyde's death at the time, Clarke Henderson has learned that he can live without her. The sorrow Nora expressed and really. felt, softened him; the knowledge that she loved him did the rest. He makes but an indifferent husband, however. The love is mostly on Nora's side, and she is painfully, terribly jealous., For literature engrosses most of Clarke's attention, and he neglects everything else for his pen. Nora is proud of her husband's fast-growing reputation, but she knows he would have been different 'with Clyde; she never forgets that she is not his first j6ve, that her success sprang from Clyde's grave; she would sometimes reproach him with this, did, she not remember the past and its lessons. Ellen is married, and happy. She, too, remembers Clyde - so well, that her only child, a little girl, bears her dead cousin's name. She has golden hair, and dark violets of eyes, and she is as dear to Ralph Ber- trand as she is to her parents. She will one day be the gainer for this affection. For to this day Ralph is true to Clyde's memory- to this day he holds her a woman above all other women. Happy in this, that he does not know she  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7632-00000148"/> 300     CLYDE WARDLEIGH. would iever have been his. That secret died with her. Ellen keeps it,sacredly. And Clyde never gave her lover pain. Ralph Bertrand is a man of wealth now; honored, respected, sought after by all. But his life here has missed its full completeness; it may be that he will find it in the hereafter. And, after all, who knows but that Clyde Ward- leigh's fate was in truth the happiest? After storm- calm; after weariness rest; and so, after her stormy life, she has won the only true calm -the only perfect rest. Silently bearing her cross, she has won that blessing in disguise, an early death. It has crowned her, in the loving remembrance which lives after her, with eternal youth. The passing years cannot age her. And on earth there is more of suffering than joy, more thorns than roses, more tears than smiles. Who knows but that after all the old ,heathen belief may be true- - Whom the gods love, die young! THE END.    &#xD;</p>
