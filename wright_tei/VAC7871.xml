L -          O DEEP, in the primeval forest of St. Mary's, lying bet, the Patuxent and the Wicomico rivers, stands the n, manor house of Luckenough. The traditions of the neighborhood assert the origin of manor, and its quaint, happy, and Aot unmusical name to been-briefly this-- --That the founder of Luckenough was Alexander Kale a Polish soldier of fortune, some time in the service of (ee Calvert, Baron of Baltimore, first, Lord Proprietary of!M land. This man had, previous to his final emigration t{ New World, passed through a life ofthe most wonderful v situdes-wonderful even for those days of romance and-d ture. It was said that he was born in one quarteif-the g] educated in another, initiated into warfare in the third, buried in the fourth. In his boyhood he was the friend pupil of Guy Fawkes, he engaged in the gunpowderplot, after witnessing the terrible fate of his master, he escape Spanish America, where he led, for years, a sort of bucca (23)  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7871-00000005"/> i. 24  .    THE  MSSIN G   BRIDE. life. He afterwards returned to Europe, and then followed years of military service wherever his hireling sword was needed. But the soldier of fortune was ill-paid by his mistress. His misfortunes were as proverbial as his bravery, or as his en. ergetic complaints of "ill luck" could make them. He had drawn his sword in alm6st every quarrel of his time, on every battle field in Europe, to find himself, at the end of his military career, no richer than he was at its beginning-save in wounds and scars, honor and glory, and a wife and son. It was at this point of his life that he met with Leonard Calvert, and em. barked with him for Maryland, where he afterwards received from the Lord Proprietary -the grant of the. manor " aforesaid." It is stated that when the old soldier went with some com- panions to take a look at his new possessions, he was so pleased with the beauty, grandeur, richness and promise of the place, that a glad smile broke over lis dark, storm-beaten, battle- scarred face, and he- remained still "smiling as in delighted visions," until one of his friends spoke, and said, "Well, comradet I s tis &amp; i d7aue y I?' "Yaw, mine frient!" answered the new lord of the manor, in his broken English, cordially grasping the hand of his com- panion, "dish ish loke enough!" Different constructions hive been put upon this simple answer --first, that Lukkinnuf was the original Indian name of the tract; secondly, that Alexander Kalouga christened his manor in honor of Lekenoff, the native village of his wife, the heroic Marie Zelenski, the compation of all his campaigns and voyages, and the first lady of his manor; thirdly, that the grateful and happy soldier had only meant to express his per- fect satisfaction with his fortune, and to say, A "Yes, this is luck enough I luck- enough to repay me for all the past " "'Be' it s'lt may, from time immemorial' the place has been I- ace kenru gh."  - The manor comprises several hundred acres of, cleared land, a considerable portion of the surrounding forest.

So isolatedi :indeed, was the manor, that for generations the i owners seemed to consider it the very centre of things created 11' --the capital of civilization, and to sneer at all beyond the ; forest as mere " outside barbarians."' I will not say but that i they might admit the neighboring little port of B  - ,and the city of Baltimore, to be useful. appendages to Luckenough : -created for the convenience of the masters of Luckenough, seeing that they were necessary to the shipping and sale of toq ;' bacco, wheat and corn, the staple productions of Luckenough. Now if you ask, whether the men of the family never were forced into the world of business, or if the youths never were sent to college, and so learned to modify the exaggerated exotism of their race, I answer no.- The head of the family usually effected his sales and made his purchaset through his B   agent, a shrewd, long-headed trader, who lid business with several important mercantile houses in Baltimore, and was, little likely to cross the self-conceit of his most pra 'erQ tron. And as for the young men of the house they neter: M1 farther into the world for their education than the neighboring academy of C   , an old and well. established classical and  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7871-00000007"/> THE   MSSING   B    ID E. mathematical school, founded by the planters for the benefit of their sons-but not well calculated to prune the pride of the proudest among them-for even there the boys of Luckenough assumed to be lords paramount of their schoolmaster. And if any member of-the family, by a rare chance, went upon his tra- vels, he was sure to pass through the world the same self-centred, self-satisfied, isolated&amp;creature, and to return as he went, un- ir066d. The communiity around Luckenough certainly con- Ito foster the haughtiness of that family. For in almost country there is oine great estate so' pre-eminent in size, value and importance, as to be an enduring object of interest and speculatice r to thl community, and to clothe its owner with rather an undue authority in all agricultural, conimercial, po- litical, and other questio:ns of the neighborhood. And Luck- irenough and its proprietors had enjoyed this evil distinction since the days of its foundation. -'A host of dependants-needy relations also, contributed to cultivate this spirit of self-importance in 'the head of the house. 'And never was Irish tribe more prolific, or Scotch clan more united, as a family. It had been the custom of the masters of Luckenough, from the time of its ambitious founder, to be- queath the undivided landed estate to the eldest son-or failing sons--to the eldest daughter-and to portion off the other children with moderate legacies of money or personal property, sunfficient, had they been of an industrious, frugal, and enterpris- ing race-to start them fairly in life; but being whit they were- proud, indolent and hopeless, it was not always enough to keep them in decent poverty. Hence the purse of the proprietor of Luckenough was often called into requisition, and never in vain, for afjJpense would have-been readily met by the head of the faiily, rather than the mortification of seeing one of its members in-the poor house or the prison.      -       I So,^$ieration after generation vegetated the dull family of Luckenough--every son more hopelessly thick-headed and self-  S satisfied than- hisfather before him, and living on because they  had -not life enough to die--or in other words, lasting because       T    IIGHTo the calm. depressed tone of their constitutions and conitions "ever at any tie made draft enough upon the dital powers, to athem.

He was a perfect beauty about this time, no doubt, but that did not prevent him from  receiving the hand of his cousin, Henrietta Kalouga, who had waited for him many a w eary year. No children blessed his late marriage, and as year after year passed, until himself and his wife were well stricken ill years, p  eople, w ho never lost interest in the great estate, began to wonder to which mong his tribe of impoverished relations, Nickolas Waugh would bequeath the manor of Luckenough. His choice fell at length upon his orphan grand-niece, the beautiful Edith Lance, whom he took from the Cathoie O rphan Asylum, where she had found refuge    since the death of her 3 parents, and placed in one of the best Convent schools il the souh.                     home from At the age of seventeen, Edith was brought home from school, and establishe d, a t Luckenough, as the adopted daugh- and acknowledged heiress of her uncle. telicate, dreamy and retiring, and tinged with a certain pen- siveness, the effect of too much early sorrow and seclu sio a a very sensitive temperament, Edith better loved the.'0i0 e I of the grand old forest of St. lI[ary's, or the loneline he own shaded rooms at Luckenough, than any society  ?'.0drum neighborhood could offer here And when at the call- of social duty she did go into company, she exercised a refining and subduing influence, involuntary as it was potent.   There was one social amusement, however, that Edith really -did like to favor. That was the annual'ball at the C---aca- demy, given by the students at the commencement, and patron- ized by their sisters, cousins, and young friends, male and female I These were rather juvenile parties, though parents, guardians and the professors attended, to give the sanction of their pre- sence. Edith was the star of these assemblies, and the queen of  ! every mother's darling there. All the students worshipped her with that pure, passionate enthusiasm that only school boys or poets know and feel. And Edith-I know not what harsh usage during her orphanage had given her a shy heart towards - her elders and equal in age, but Edith preferred the society of those younger than herself, and she liked the frank, warm- hearted college lads, as if they had been her brothers. And if there were " bad boys" among them, she did not find it out, for such never came within her sphere, or if by chance any did, they became ameliorated. Edith's nature and the style of her beauty was very refined. Her form was of medium size and perfect symmetery. Her beautiful head sat upon her falling shoulders. Her .complex- ion was of the purest semi-transparent fairness seen in the white sea-shell. Her forehead was shaded by fine, silky, black : ringlets, so lightas -to be lifted by every breeze, and throw - wavering soft shadows upon her pearly cheeks.

All men capable of bearing arms, rapidly mustered into companies, and hastened to put theminselves at the disposal of the government. The lower counties of Maryland were left comparatively un- protected. Old men, women, children and n   egroes were all that remained in charge of the farms and plantations. Yet remote from the scenes of conflict, and hitherto undisturbed by the convulsions of the great world, they reposed in fancied safety, and never thought of such unprecedented misfortune as the evils of the war penetrating to their quiet homes. But their rest of security was broken by a tremendous shock. The British fleet, under Admiral Sir A.-Cochrane, suddenly entered the Chesapeake. And the quiet, lonely shores of the bay became the scene of a warfare scarcely paralleled in atro- city in ancient or modern times. Its defenceless villages and hamlets were suddenly run down upon, sacked, burned to the ground, and the unresisting inhabitants put to the sword. Farms and plantations shared the same fate. Dwelling houses, barns ad granaries were set on fire, and burned to ashes, and the owners a nd their families massacred in cold blood, and the negroes driven off at the point of the bayonet to the ships of the marauders, there to be drilled in military exercises and afterwards armed against their own masters. Everywhere the enemy tried to excite the slaves to revolt, and threatened to add the ghastly horrors of a servile insurrection to the accumulated evils of war. The most horrible crimes that ever blackened the souls, of the most atrocious pirates, could not exceed in ; enormity the deeds done by these licensed buccaneers, under 'theguise oLf ivilized warfare. It seemed as if in their case human nature had, with headlong recklessness, abandoned itself to the most violent and fiendish passions of crelty, rapacity and sensuality. If among this marauding band of licensed pirates and assas- sins there was one name more dreaded, more loathed and ac- cursed than the rest, it was that of the brutal and ferocious Thorg-the frequent leader of foraging parties; the unsparing   THE   FLIGHT.         38 destroyer of womanhood, infancy and age, the jackal and pur veyor of Admiral Cockburn. If anywhere there was a beau tiful woman unprotected, or a rich plantation house ill-defended this jackal was sure to scent out "the game" for his master the lion. And many were the comely maidens and youthfu wives seized and carried off by this monster. The Patuxent and the Wicomico, with the coast betweel them, offered no strong temptation to a rapacious foe-and the inhabitants reposed in the fancied security of their isolation and unimportance. The business of life went on, faintly and sorrowfully, to be sure, but still went on. The village -shops a: B--  and C--.  were kept open, though tended chiefly by women and boys. The academicians, at the little college, pur sued their studies, or played at forming juvenile military comrn panies. The farms and plantations were cultivated chiefli under the direction of ladies, whose husbands, sons and bro. thers were absent with the army. -No one thought of danger to St. Mary's. Most terrible was the awakening from .this dream of safety when, on the morning of the 17th of August, the division under the command of Admiral Cockburn-the most dreaded and abhorred of all-was seen to enter the mouth of the Pa- tuxent in full sail for Benedict. Nearly all the able-bodied men were, as I said, absent with the army at the time when the comrn bined military and naval forces, under Admiral Cockburn and General Ross, landed at that place. None remained -to guard the homes, but aged men, women, infants and negroes. 4A universal panic seized the neighborhood, and nothing oc. curred to the defenceless people-but instant flight. Females and children were hastily put into carriages, the Umost valuable items of plate or money hastily packed up, negroes mustered, and the whole caravan put upon a hurried march for Prince George's, Montgomery, or other upper counties of the state. With very few exceptions, the farms and plantations were evai cuated, and left to the mercy of the invaders. At sunrise, all was noise, bustle and confusion at Lucks enough.  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7871-00000010"/> 84      THE  MSSING    BRIDE. The lawn was filled with baggage wagons, horses, mules, cows, oxen, sheep, swine, baskets of poultry, barrels of provi- sions, boxes of property, and men and maid servants hurrying wildly about among them, carrying trunks and parcels, loading -carts, tackling harness, marshaling cattle, and making, other preparations for a rapid retreat towards Commodore Waugh's patrimonial estate in Montgomery county. -? In the hall at Luckenough, the master strode up and down among corded trunks, and yelping dogs, and hurrying servants. Hle was a man of powerful size and weight, and formidable presence. He forcibly reminded one of a huge, bull-dog, or rather, of the animal after which it is named. His great griz- zled head and beard, his enormous chest, huge, rounded shoul- ders, heavy limbs and measured tread, and a habit he had when vexed, of thrusting forward his head and bellowing forth a prolonged "Oh-h-h-h!" assuredly suggested the likeness. And as he strode up and down among his men, the old hall shook as at the tread of an elephant. Fierce shame had lent unusual energy to the old-man's manner, and the transverse scar across his face glowed like a bar of red hot iron. Ill could the vete- ran of twenty battles brook this rapid retreat without even a meeting with the enemy. But well did the invalided soldier know that it would be sheer madness to remain and encounter the advancing army of the invaders. And so he strode up and down the hall, giving vent to his impatience by swearing at the terrified servants, and kicking the howling dogs. In the midst of this the back.-parlor door opened, and the mistress of the house came out into the hall. She was a hand- some woman for her age-really fifty--seeming forty-with a fair, fat person, brown hair and brown eyes, fine teeth, much displayed in: her frequent smiles, and white, plump neck and arms, often :half uncovered for coolness. Now, however, she wore a close-fitted Nankeen pelisse. A Leghorn bonnet and veil completed her dress for travelling. She had strong health, calm nerves, a phlegmatic constitution, and an even, contented, -cheerful temper. It was these things that gave her such influ-   I             THE E  PL I GIT. ence over her more excitable and impulsive companion. She, with her serene temperament and easy disposition,. received the occasional onslaughts of. the old soldier's violence very much as our troops at New Orleans, with their bales of cotton and wooli, received the British cannonading, and with very much the same good effect. And now as she came out into the hall, her pre- sench acted like oil upon the waves.-it calmed the commotion. The old man turned towards her, and his countenance and ' his voice softened as he said-  "All ready so soon, Old Hen I  But where is Edith?" "I don't know.   I thought she was here,' said Mistress Henrietta. "Here I no I and the sun half an hour high!" and the old man's voice began to rise with his temper, as he vociferated, loud enough to be heard at- the remotest extremity of the house-- "Edith I Edith! where are you, you hussy?"    "Here I am, uncle," said a- calm, musical voice, and Edith came out from an adjoining room. Her white, flowing wrapper, the slight, silky, black curls playing carelessly around the pearly forehead, the veiled and : dreamy eyes, the abstracted look, and more than all, the little,  red-bound volume she held in her hand, seemed so unready, so impractical, that it put the old soldier past all his patience.  "Now will you look at that girl I  I say I want you all to  look at her!   he exclaimed, turning around. "If upon this : morning, also, she isn't poring over a book,- when we are ready  to start  I What is it you have got there, minx?"     I "Marmion, sir."                     I "Marmion/   What in the fiend's name is that? Hand it  here." Edith obeyed, and without looking at the book, he took it  and   hurled it out into the lawn, exclaiming-  "There  I   Vow did you ever know me to break my word ,  hussy  ?"  -                      }  - "No, sir." ,  "Very well, then I  go and get ready, and be sure if  you am I  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7871-00000011"/> 86      THE  MSSING    BRIDE. not here in ten minutes, we will set forward without you." And so saying, the old man set himself down upon the wooden settee, at the foot of the stairs, and took his watch out to note the time. Edith disappeared into her chamber. "-I never saw such a wrong-headed, romantic fool! What will ever become of her? She'll come to a bad end, I'm afraid, with poring over the fetched books." "Oh, poor thing I what can you expect? She's got no com- panions of her own age. She must amuse herself some way," said good Henrietta. "Oh-h-h I companions of her own age!" roared the Com- modore, " what does she want with companions of her own age-and why can't she amuse herself knitting stockings for the niggers, like you do? I'll take and marry her to Professor Grimm, that's what I'll do I And there'll be two book-worms to keep each other's company. I'll Oh, here she comes!" In half the specified time Edith returned, equipped for her journey, in her riding-dress and hat. "I am ready, uncle," she said, as she stood drawing on her gloves. "Well, then we'll set forward. I want to get as far as Horsehead this day, if possible. A d---d mean, -miserable dog I am, to be sneaking away from the enemy," growled the veteran, to himself. The doors opening into the hall were then locked. Edith was placed upon her pony, and attended by her old maid Jenny, and her old groom Oliver. Commodore and Mrs. Waugh entered the family carriage, which they pretty well filled up. Mrs. Waugh's woman sat upon the box behind, and the Commodore's man drove the coach. And the whole family party set forward on their journey. They went in advance of the caravan, so as not to be hindered and inconvenienced by its slqw and cumbrous movements. A ride of three miles through the old forest, brought them to   THE    FLIGHT. the open, hilly country. Here the road forked. And here family were to separate. It had been arranged that, as Edith was too delicate to bN the forced march of days' and nights' continuance before th could reach Montgomery, she should proceed to Hay Hlill plantation near the line of Charles county' owned by Colon Fairlie, whose young daughter, Fanny, recently made a brid had been the schoolmate of Edith. Here, at the fork, the party halted to take leave. Commodore Waugh called his niece to ride up to the ca riage window, and gave her many messages for Colonel Fairli for Fanny, and for Fanny's young bridegroom, and man charges to be careful and prudent, and not to ride out unal tended, &amp;c. And then he called up the two   old negroes, and charge  them to see their young mistress safely at Eay Eill, and thel to return to Luckenough, and take care of the house and suct things as were left behind, in case the British should not visit it, and to shut up the house after them in case they shoula come  and rob it and leave it standing. Two wretched old negroes would be in little personal danger from the soldiers. So argued Commodore    Waugh, as he took leave of them, and gave orders for the carriage to move on up the main branch of the road leading north, towards Prince George's and Montgomery. county.              -         ^ This pleasant road ran along the side of a  purling brook, under the shadow of the great trees that skirted the forest, and Edith ambled leisurely along, low humming to herself som e pretty song, or listening to the merry carols of the birds, or noticing the speckled fish that gamboled through the dark glimmering stream, or  reverting to the subject of her last readin   llg.            ujc of     -s But   beneath all this childish play of fancy, one  grave, soer.  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7871-00000012"/> rowful thought lay heavy upon Edith's tender heart. It was the thought of poor old Luclienough, " deserted at its utmost need," to t  heravages of the foe. Edith migE t have been as wrong-headed and romantic as her uncle accused her of being; for now the old m  ansion, that her heart clung to so fondly, seemed t o t ak e a personal character, and in the dumb eloquence of its loneliness and desertion, to reproachher. She thought, too, of her own particular nook at Luckenough, of her cherished  books and pictures and musical instruments, and little statuettes of saints and angelsand heroes and .heroines, of her vases and boxes and baskets, and pretty toys of all sorts, not one of which dreaming Edith had removed in her hasty departure. And she thought of all the dear old spots and places about the building that she loved so well-they seemed to her like members and features of some faithful friend, and she could not bear the thought of their destruction. Then came the question if it were not possible, in case of the house being attacked, to save it-even for her to save it. Edith's visionary head was full of stories of heroic women, who had wrought miracles in the way of saving or destroying castles and fortified towns, or in pre- serving the lives of fathers, brothers, husbandS, and children. Aqd she remembered no single instance in which a woman had lost life, limb or honor in such an attempt. Whatever other women or men either might suffer at the hands of the enemy, these heroic women always came through triumphantly--so Edith's reading showed, and she had no counter evidence. While these things were brewing in Edith's mind, she rode slowly and more slowly, until at length her pony stopped. Then she noticed, for the first time, the heavy, downcast looks of her attendants. "What is the matter?' she asked. "Oh! Miss Edith, don't ask me, honey-don't I Ain't we- dem -got to go back to de house and stay dar by our two selves, arter we see you safe?" said Jenny, crying. "No! what? you two alone II exclaimed Edith', looking from one to the other.   THE   FL IGHT.         39 "t Yes, Miss Edith, 'deed we has, chile-but you needn't look so 'stonish and 'mazed. "You can't help of it, chile. An' if de British do come dar, and burn de house, and heave we- dem into de fire jes' out of wanton, it'll ony be two poor, ole, unvaluable niggers burned up. Ole marse know -dat well enough-dat's de reason he resks we." "But for what purpose have you to return,?" asked Edith, wondering.                       - "Oh!  to feed de cattle and de poultry, and take care o' de :1  things dat's left behine," sobbed Jenny, now completely broken' down by her terrors. "I know-I jis does-how dem white niggers o' Co'bu'ns 'ill set de house o -fire, an' heave we-dem two poor old innocen's into de flames out'n pure debblish wan- ton!" Edith passed her slender fingers through her curls, stringing them out as was her way when absent in thought. She was turning the whole matter over in her mind.  She might possibly save the mansion, though these two old people were not likely to be able to do so-on the contrary, their ludicrous  terrors would tend to stimulate the wanton cruelty of the marauders to destroy them with the house.- Edith suddenly took her resolu- tion, and turned her horse's head, directing her attendants-to' follow. "But where are you going to go, Miss Edith?" asked her  groom, Oliver, now speaking for the first time. "Back to Luckenough." "What for, Miss Edith, for goodness sake?"  "Back to Luckenough to guard the dear old house, and take care of you two." "But oh, Miss Edy! Miss Edyl for Marster in /leaven's sake what'll 'come o' you?" "What the Master in Heaven wills!"          a "Lord, Lord, Miss Edy  ole marse 'ill kill we-dem. What - 'ill ole marse say?

"They will say," said Edith; "if I meet the enemy and save the house-they will say that Edith Lance is a heroine, and her name will be probably preserved in the memory of the neighbor- hood. But if I fail and lose my life, they will say that Edith was a cracked brained girl who deserved her fate, and that they had always predicted she would come to a bad end." "Better go on to Hay Hill, Miss Edy I 'Deed, 'fore marster, better go to Hay Hill." "No,?' said the young girl, "my resolution is taken--we will return to Luckenough." The arguments of the old negroes waxed fainter and fewer. They felt a vague hut potent confidence in Edith and her abilities, and a sense of protection in her presence, from which t hey were loth to part. The sun was high when they entered the forest shades again. "See," said Edith to her companions, " everything is so fresh and beautiful and joyous- here I I cannot even imagine danger." They reached luckenough before noontide, and the two old people, with their hearts very much lightened and cheered, and encouraged by the presence of their young mistress, busied themselves with opening the house and making her comfortable. Oliver put away the horses, and went to the spring for cold water, and to the mound for ice. And Jenny opened the shutters in  the young lady's room, helped her off with her riding-dress, put it away, and went and prepared dinner. Edith went out to look for her lost volume of Marmion, found it in the grass, brought it in, and threw herself upon the sofa to finish the poem. The summer day was so calm and cool, the forest home so silent anl peaceful, Edith's own sensations so serene and sweet, that she did not realize the'idea of danger. The day passed calmly -and pleasantly. But when the evening shadows begun to fall darkly around the old house, Edith's heart grew faint and oppressed with pro- lphetic, terrors. Edith had acted suddenly, impulsively, from the warmth and generosity of her own heart; but had she done well and wisely?   !             THE    FLIGHT. This was the question she asked herself. Many an enthusis before our girl, has acted in haste to repent at leisure. ,Yet, J   Edith looked upon the beloved old homestead that she was the to try to save from destruction, and upon the faithful old servam that seemed so confident of safety in her presence, and who we doing everything in their power to prove their gratitude al sense of her goodness, she could not repent at all. If the a were to do over again, she would do it.  N After tea was over, Edith came out and sat upon the pore to enjoy the coolness and quiet of the summer evening The old people, their day's work finished, came and sat upc the steps near her-they seemed to hover about her with a sens of security, as if she had been their guardian angel, or som superior being, capable of protecting them. The sun had set. The last lingering light had faded from th west. There was no moon and the night would have been ver/ dark but for the stars. Still, everything was so beautiful, so peaceful, so fresh an( pleasant  There was music in the ripple of the little forest stream, as it ran along singing to itself-music in the shiver of the dewy forest leaves, as they leaned, whispering sweet, solemn mysteries together-gladness in the merry chirp of insects wak- ing to enjoy with them the coolness of the summer night-om fort and trust in the confidential twitter of little birds, murmur- ing to each other as they settled in their nests.  - All nature reposed or enjoyed itself, under the protection of the Great Father. And should not they?  All things had faith-why should they doubt alone ? And as the night advanced, the stars came out brighter and brighter. Before them, in the south, shone the great planet Jupiter, so strong as almost to cast a shadow. He stood looking down like the warden of the sky. And now, from the forest, came a cheerful sound above all other sounds. It was the hearty call of the whip-poor-will-the solitary bird that sat upon- a branch of the old elm in the thicket near. "I like the voice of the whip-poor-will, don't you?" asked  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7871-00000014"/> 42      THE  MSSING   BR IDE.

Old Oliver said little, but sat upon the lowest step caressing the dog. Thley sat out there a long time, for therewas a sense of comparative freedom and safety felt by all out there in the open air, under the kindly stars, and among the other children of nature-and there wa s, among the three, an unspoken, unacknowledged dread of going in to shut themselves up in -the great, dark, empty house. But at length Edith thought it right and proper, and she arose to dismiss her attendants. "Oh! Miss Edy! if you would please-if you would please to let we-dem sleep close by your room dis ebenin' 1" pleaded Jenny. "Certainly, if 'that will make your sleep the quieter," smiled Edith. "You may bring your mattrass, and lay it down by the side of my bed, and your brother Oliver may bring his, and lay it in the hall, just outside of my door, and I will only shut the door, not fasten it, if he is -if he would feel like he was forsaken-locked out."  'Hadn't we better call the dogs, and lock them inside the' hall, Miss Edy?" "Certainly not-they will be better guardians sleeping on the front porch."  These arrangements were finally concluded, and the front door was locked and barred, and the little family retired. Poor Edith I No sooner did she find herself shut within the, four walls of her chamber, than the hope, the trust, the con- fidence, the sense of safety, she had felt in the open air, began to abandon her-nor was she reassured by the words of Jenny; who said-  "Seems to me, Miss Edy, we-dem was better off out doors. Seems-ef it ar de Lord's will we is- to be killed-better be shot running like a hare, dan be murdqred, up here in dis close room, like a mouse in a trap!"          -  ' "Say your prayers, Jenny, and commit yourself to the care of Providence.

"Yes I if it will do you any good. There-good-night l" said Edith, addressing herself to sleep. It was some time before she was lost in slumber. And then she was suddenly aroused by the voice of Jenny,- calling--  "Miss Edith I Miss Edith 1 Oh for de Lord's sake, wake up!" "What's the matter!" exclaimed the young girl, starting up.. "Jes listen I Jes youi listen 1 Listen at dat der noise on t'other side o' de house!" Edith listened. "It is only the wind, Jenny, shaking the old shutters," said Edith, as she turned over, and tried to calm her somewhat ex- cited nerves to rest. It was more difficult this time. But at length she fell into a disturbed sleep, from which she was again qOickly startled by the sound of Jenny's voice, crying- "Oh, Miss Edy I Miss Edy I for your life!--for your pre. cious life, jump ap!"

"The marowdiesi the marowdies, Miss Edyl Oh I don't you hear them tramping all around the house?" Edith sprang out of bed and went to a window, and listened breathlessly.

Old Jenny laid down and sobbed compunctiously-"I can't help of it I I hopes neber to see sich anoder night while eber I lib." Edith returned to bed, and addressed herself once more to sleep. It was in vain-her nerves were fearfully excited. [n vain she tried to combat her terrors-they completely over- mastered her. In vain she recalled her ownresolutions of for- titude and courage-in vain she summoned to her mind the examples of all the heroic women of history; her heart seemed fainting in her bosom with dread. This was partly to be at- tributed to Edith's delicate constitution. A heroic spirit re- quires a strong physical organization--or, in default of that, a powerful mental excitement to corroborate it. Edith had neither. And now that vivid imagination which had been in safety her greatest delight, now in peril became her most terri- ble scourge. It conjured up to her the scenes of violence of which her chamber might become the bloody stage. At length she was driven agin to the foot of -God's throne for mercy. , She clasped her hands and prayed. Ah I more than the recollection of all the examples of all the heroines of history, did this prayer calm and restore the per- turbed mind of Edith. Repeating it, she sank into a deep, re- freshing sleep, of several hours. She was violently shocked out of it. Old Jenny stood over her, lifting her up, shaking her, and shouting in her ears, "Miss Edith I Miss Edith! it is no false 'larm now!

Trembling all over, Jeraiy essayed to do as she was bid;, but only succeeded in putting out the expiring light.

Edith struck a light, while the sound of footsteps and voices' in the hall warned her that several persons had entered. "It's Nell, and Liddy, and Sol, from Hay HillI   Oh, Miss Edy!

BRIDE. "Thorg at Hay Hill I Good heaven of heavens I and the family? and Fanny-? - Merciful God I Fanny?" The three fugitives began at once, in a wild and hurried man- ner, to tell their story. But Nell, with a wierd, commanding gesture, arrested the speech of the others, and came forward herself to tell the tale. She was a wild, unearthly figure, as she stood there in the wd glare of the candle, where all else around was in mhrky ob- scurity--a wierd figure, jet black-thin as a skeleton, and bent with age. A scant, red, linsey gown, short and sleeveless, ex- posed the long, skinny arms and legs, the wizened face was fearfully contrasted with the protruded and glaring eye-balls and gleaming fangs, and with the white, woolly hair, around which was twisted a sanguine red handkerchief. Her abrupt and angular gestures, her glaring eyes, her cat-like bounds and springs, gave a supernatural and witch-like aspect to the most frightful looking old hag you ever saw. With many "starts and flaws," and staring of the wild orbs, and lifting of the skinny arm, she told the awful story, which- disentangled from her wild confusion of ideas-'was this: "That about eight o'clock on the evening before, the family - of Colonel Fairlie, of Hay Hill, were assembled, in the parlor for tea, and only waiting for the return -of Mr. Laurie, the colonel's son-in-law, from Charlotte Hall, to sit down at table, when a large party of foragers, under Thorg, rode into the yard, dismounted, and entered the house, which they proceeded to sack. No resistance was made by the feeble household, where resistance would have been madness, as it woiuld have :been totally ineffectual, except in provoking the foe to greater violence. Only Colonel Fairlie endeavored to secure the safety of his daughter by flight and concealment. He seized her quickly, and, with what speed age could make, bore her off to a neighboring woods. But he was seen, pursued, overtaken, his child torn from his protecting bosom, and he himself put to the sword. Half an hour later Mr. Laurie returned to find his home : a smoking heap of ruins, his father-in-law murdered, and his   TH E   ATTACK.

He was instantly surrounded, knocked down and bayo neted-absolutely impaled-pinned to the earth by the pikes of the soldiers. The negroes had fid,'leaving Eanny in the hands of the drunken and demonized soldiery.    ;: "The main army was supposed to be on the march north- wards to Washington City. It was more than probable that they had overtaken the caravans of the retreating planters." It is impossible to describe the effect of this story upon Edith. Horror, wonder, despair, seemed to confuse and paralyze her mind. "Go," she said, abstractedly, mechanically. "Go, Jenny, take these poor creatures into the kitchen, and do what you can for them. I must consider what is best for us all." Jenny and Oliver spoke to the half-crazed fugitives, and drew them away from the young lady's chamber. And, left alone, Edith tried to collect her thoughts-to under- stand what had occurred, and to prepare for what might be to come.              , , 'What had occurred?

But she could not think of self now. Her whole mind was absorbed with the thought of Fanny. It was necessary, however, to arouse herself, to do something to prepare for what might happen. And what was likely to happen? Why, that ere the day was over the marauders would visit Luckenough. And how should she meet them? The deep, tragic events occurring around her had exalted Edith's mind above the thought of self, or the fear of death--there was but one thing she feared above all others, to share Fanny's fate, to fall into the hands of the licentious soldiery. And this she resolved to forestall by providing herself with the means of instant death, to be used if S the occasion demanded it. This having been determined upon, Edith's mind grew calm. She arose and opened the shutters to look out upon the night. It was no longer night but morning. -Day was dawning, and the east was tinged with the flush of the coming sun. There is something always encouraging in the dawn of day and the rising of the sun. Edith's heavy heart grew less oppressed, its gloomy despair stole away with the shadows of the night- nothing could happen to herself but death, and death, even by her own hand, did not seem so horrible by daylight as it had seemed in the murky darkness of the night. Her faith in God and man-her faith in her own moral power-grew strong. She did not despair of saving Luckenough even now, even from such marauders as had laid waste Hay Hill and'massacred its house- hold. Edith began to dress herself While she was thus occu- pied, Jenny came into the room, bringing a cup of strong coffee. "I thought I would bring it to you before break'as', Miss Edith, seein' how you was broke o' your res' las' night." "Thank you, Jenny," said Edith, taking the cup and quaffing its contents, "but offer some to those poor creatures in the kitchen. They are more in need of it than I am."

"Well, poor creature, I hope her wretched life will be saf, You must go and attend to the others now. I shall not wai anything more just yet." ; After breakfast was over, and the morning work hastily dih patched, Oliver presented himself at his young mistress' bed room door, and inquired if he had not better shut up and bar all the doors and windows. "No, Oliver, no I there is not a door or window here tha they would not delight to break open, and it would be but plan for them to do it. No, we will not tempt and excite their anger by giving them anything to combat. I have a different policy There are powers harder to overthrow than bars and bolts of iron and doors of oak-the spiritual influences that surround home, harmlessness, peacefulness, non-resistance I No, Oliver bar and bolt no doors or windows, that would only provoke and accelerate the attackand cause the ruin of our homestead. No, you will open wide the doors and windows, as our usual custom is in summer weather. Let nothing be changed from the usual routine.  We must not look as if we dreamed of outrage. I shall sit here in the hall. Go- bring my work-stand and chair and footstool hither, and set them near the front door." Oliver did so. "Now open the front door and the back door, and prop them open to let the breeze blow through as usual." Oliver followed the directions of his mistress; and then stood, nat in hand, to receive farther orders, while Edith seated herself. at her stand and began to arrange her sewing.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7871-00000019"/> 52      THE   MSSING    BRIDE. "Oliver,' she said, "here is a little pocket pistol that belonged to my father. I kept it for his sake; it may do me good service in some extreme need; I wish you would look and tell me if it is in good order ;" and she took the elegant. little toy of death from her stand drawer, and handed it to her old servant. He looked at it with the eye of a connoisseur. "It's a perfect beauty, Miss Edith. No, honey, nothing 'tall de matter of dis yer pistol." "Have you any powder and shot, Oliver?" "Some down at de quarter, honey." "Go and get it then; I want -you to load that pistol for me, and show me how to use it."          A Oliver disappeared to do his mistress's bidding. He cleaned the little weapon, prepared it for her use, loaded and brought it to her, and showed her how to fire it off. He loaded and she fired it several times. "There, Oliver, I think I can trust myself to use it now. Now load it well, Oliver; put in a small bullet, and give it to me." Oliver did so, and Edith took the pistol and placed if in her work-stand drawer. "Now, for Marster's sake, Miss Edy, what you gwine do 'long o' dat der little wiper-snake?" inquired Jenny, with a shudder, as she entered and saw the transaction. "Only keep it by me, in case of emergency, Jenny. But I trust to have no occasion for its use. Jenny, get your yarn, your reel, and stool, and bring them here, and sit down with me at work. And, Oliver, keep about the front door here-not on guard but at work--get your wooden rake and be engaged in clear- ing up the dry leaves from the grass. We must not seem as if we expected a foe, or thought of violence. We must look home- like, peaceful, harmless, non-resistant-doing no wrong and expecting none. We must show no fear--make no opposition; and then I feel sure that though they may rob the house, they will leave it and its furniture uninjured, and ourselves entirely unmolested. This is the best-tthe only thing to do. For if we were even now to fly, we should be just as apt as not to fall I .

"But Thorg! Miss Edithl if Thorg should comel" sail Jenny. "Still, if you follow the policy I have pointed out, you and Oliver will be in no danger, even from Thorg." "But you, Miss Edith I you!" "I have my remedy at hand." v Cheered and fortified by Edith's courage and constancy, the old people arranged -their morning's employment, as she had directed. And thus the forenoon was passed. Edith sat sewing at her work-stand-her heart filled with grief for the fate of her friend Fanny; with misgiving for: the safety of her uncle's retreating caravan, and with dread of what might, the next hour, befall herself. But she governed and suppressed these forebodings, whose expression would only do harm.  Her outward appearance was calm and brave, and she spoke only to encourage and fortify her two attendants. Jenny sat near her mistress, reeling off yarn. And O)liver, with his wooden rake, cleared up, the grass of the lawn. Once Edith arose from  her work to go into her own room and pray, for the failing heart to receive new strength. And those few moments of her absence were fraught with fate to Edith. As soon as she had disappeared and closed her cham. ber door after her, Jenny left her seat, stepped cautiously to the front door, and  beckoned Oliver silently to approach. Oliver softly dropped his rake, and came stealing up thesteps' of the portico.

The old woman sat down to her reel, and reeled away as if nothing had happened. What are you doing with that, Oliver?" asked Edith, un- suspiciously, as she re-entered the hall. "Only 'suring of mysef how it's all right, Miss Edith," said the old man, with some nervous trepidation. "And is it all right?" "Yes, Miss Edith, thank Marster l" said the old creature, "with the si'gh of a great deliverance," as he replaced the wea- pon in the stand-drawer, and turned to go about his business. "I do not believe that we shall have occasion to use it, Oli- ver," said Edith, resuming her seat and her work. "Where "are those poor souls from Hay Hill?" she asked, after a little pause, remembering the fugitives for the first time since breakfast. '"Soun' asleep, Miss Edith, down at my quarter-'deed dey is, chile, sleepin' like dead. I 'spose how dey was fleein' and Pfendin all night last, an' dey's perf'ly 'zausted." That summer day- was so holy in its beauty, so bright, so clear, so cool; that rural scene was so soothing in its influ- ences, so calm, so fresh, so harmonious; it was almost impossi- ble- to associate with that lovely day and scene, thoughts of wrong and violence and cruelty. So felt Edith as she some- times lifted her eyes from her work to the beauty and glory of nature around her. And if now her heart ached, it was more with grief for Fanny's fate than dread of her own. There   ;t THE           ATTACeKi.  comes, borne upon the breeze that lifts her dark tresses, an fans her pearly cheeks, the music of many rural voices-of ril pling streams and rustling leaves and twittering birds an humming bees. But mingled with these, at length, there comes to her atten tive ear a sound, or the suspicion of a sound, of distant horse hoofs falling upon the forest leaves-it draws nearer-it be comes distinct-she knows it now-it is-it is a troop of Bri tish soldiers approaching the house I They rode in a totally undisciplined and disorderly manner reeling in their saddles, drunken with debauchery, red-hot reeking from some scene of fire and blood I And in no condition to be operated upon by Edith's beauti. ful and holy influences. They galloped into the yard-they galloped up to the house -their leader threw himself heavily from his horse and ad. vanced to the door.

The low, square-built, thick-set body, the huge head, the buill neck, heavy jowl, coarse sensual lips, bloodshot -eyes, and fiery visage, surrounded with coarse red hair,-the whole brutalized, demonized aspect could belong to no monster in the universe but that cross between the fiend and the beast called: TsHOG I And now he came, intoxicated, inflamed, burning with fierce passions from some fell scene of recent violence l Pale as death, and nearly as calm, Edith awaited his coming. She could not hope to influence this man or his associates. She knew her fate now-it was deathl-death by her own hand, before that man's foot should profane her threshold! She knew her fate, and knowing it, grew calm and strong. There were no more hopes or fears or doubts or trepidations. Over the weakness of the flesh the spirit ruled victorious, and Edith stood revealed to herself richly endowed with that'-he- roism she had so worshipped in others-in that supreme mb. ment mistress of herself and of her fate.

And how beautiful in this last fateful moment she looked   The death pallor had passed from her counte- nance-the summer breeze was lifting the light black curls- soft shadows were playing upon the pearly brow-a strange elevation irradiated her face, and it "shone as it had been the face of an angel."

Edith glanced around for her attendants. Jenny lay upon the hall floor, fallen forward upon her face, in a deep swoon, Oliver stood out upon the lawn, his teeth chattering, and his knees knocking together with terror, yet faintly meditating a desperate onslaught to the rescue with his wooden rake. "No matter 1" for first of all we must have a taste of those dainty lips; stand back, bl-t you," he vociferated with a vol- ley of appalling oaths, that sent the disorderly men, who were again crowding behind him, back into the rear; " we would be alone, d    you; do you hear ?" The drunken soldiers fell back, and he advanced towards Edith, who stood calm in desperate resolution. She raised her hand to supplicate or waive him off, he did not care which-her other hand, hanging down by her side, grasped the pistol, which she concealed in the folds of her dress. " Hear me," she said; " one moment, I beseech you I" The miscreant paused. "Proceed, my beauty  Only don't let the grace before meat be too long." I am a soldier's child," said Edith; her sweet, clear voice slightly quavering like the strings of a lute over which the wind has passed; "I am a soldier's child-my father died gallantly on the field of battle. You are soldiers, and will not hurt a soldier's orphan daughter."

"Hear me I" exclaimed Edith, raising her hand. "Well, well, go on, my dear, only don't be too long-for my men want something to eat and drink, and I have sworn not to break my fast until I know the flavor of those ripe lips." Edith's fingers closed convulsively upon the pistol still held' hidden. "I am alone and defenceless," she said; "I remained here, voluntarily, to protect our home, because I had faith in the bet- ter feelings of men when they should be appealed to. I had heard dreadful tales of the ravages of the 'enemy through neigh- boring sections of the country. I did not fully believe them. I thought them the exaggerations of terror, and knew how such stories grow in the telling. I could not credit the worst, be- lieving, as I did, the British nation to be an upright and honor- able enemy -British soldiers to be men-and British officers gentlemen. Sir, have I trusted in vain ? Will you not let me and my old servants retire in peace ? All that the cellars and storehouses of Luckenough contain, is at your disposal.

He was quickly thrown down and disarmed-no one had any hesitation in dealing with him.  "C Now then, my fair!" said Thorg, moving towards his victim. Edith was now wild with desperation-her eyes flew wildly around in search of help, where help there seemed none. Then she turned with the frenzied impulse of flying. But the men surrounded to cut off her retreat. !"Nay, nay, let her run I let her run! give her a fair start, and do you give chase! It will be the rarest sport I Fox- hunting is a good thing, but girl-chasing must be the very h--1 of sport, when I tell you--mind, I tell you, men-she shall be the exclusive prize of him who catches her!" swore the re- morseless Thorg. Edith had gained the back door. They started in pursuit. "Now, by the living Lord that made me, the first man that lays hands on her shall die!"Isuddenly exclaimed the young en- sign, wresting his sword from the hand of the corporal, spring- mg between Edith and her pursuers, flashing out the blade, and brandishing it in the faces of the foremost. - He was but a stripling, scarcely older than Edith's self-the arm that wielded that slender blade scarcely stronger than Edith's own-but the fire that flashed from the eagle eye showed a spirit to rescue or die in her defence. Thorg threw himself into the most frantic fury-a volley of the most horrible oaths was discharged from his lips.' "Upon that villain, men I beat him down I slay him I pin him to the ground with your bayonets I And then! do your will with -the girl!" But before this fiendish order could be executed, aye, before it was half spoken, whirled into the yard a body of about thirty horsemen, galloping fiercely to the rescue with drawn swords and shouting voices. They were nearly three times the number of the foraging soldiers.   CHAPTER   IV. YOUNG   AMERICA   IN  1814. "And in they burst and on they rushed!

They rushed forward, they surrounded, they fell upon the marauders with an absolute shower of blows. "Give it to them, men I This for Fanny I This for Edith I And this! and this! and this for both of them l" shouted Cloudesley, as he vigorously laid about him.

Thorg was still on foot, armed with a sword, and laying about him savagely among the crowd of foes that had surrounded him. Cloudesley was still on horseback-he had caught up an axe that lay carelessly upon the lawn, and now he rushed upon Thorg from behind.

From the impetus Cloudesley himself had re- ceived, he had nearly lost his saddle, but had recovered. "They fly I They fly I By the bones of Caesar, the miscre- ants fly I after them, my men I after them I Pursue I pursue!" Shouted Cloudesley, wheeling his horse around to follow. But just then, the young British officer standing near Edith, resting on his sword, breathing, as it were, after a severe conflict, caught Cloudesley's eyes. Intoxicated with victory, Cloudesley sprang from his horse, and raising his axe, rushed up the stairs upon the youth! Edith sprang and threw herself before the stripling, impul- sively clasping her arms around him'to shield him, and then throwing up one arm to ward off a blow, looked up and ex- claimed, "He is, my preserver-my preserver, Cloudesley!" And what did the young ensign do? Clasped Edith quietly but closely to his breast. It was a beautiful, beautiful picture t Nay, any one might understand how it was --that not years upon years of ordinary acquaintance could have so drawn, so knitted these young hearts together as those few hours of su- preme danger. "My preserver, Cloudesley 1 My preserver!" ": Cloudetsley grounded his axe. 'I don't understand that, Edith I He is a British officer." "He is my deliverer! When Thorg set his men on me to hunt me, he cast himself before me, and kept them at bay until you came!" "Mutinied!" exclaimed Cloudesley, in astonishment, and a sort of horror. "Yes, I suppose it was mutiny," said the young ensign, speaking for the first time, and blushing as he withdrew his arm friom Edith's waist.

"I can NOT reget it!" "Certainly not I There are laws of God and humanity above all military law, and such you obeyed, sir! I thank you, on the part of my young countrywoman," said Cloudesley, who ima- gined that he could talk about as well as he could fight. "If the occasion could recur, I would do it again! Yes, a thousand times!" the young man's eyes added to Edith-only to her. "But oh I perdition! while I am talking here that serpentl that copperhead I that cobra capellal is coming round againJl How astonishingly tenacious of life all foul, venomous creatures are!" exclaimed Cloudesley, as he happened to espy Thorg moving slightly where he lay; and rushed out to despatch him.  The other two young people were left alone in the hall. - "I am afraid you have placed yourself in a very, very da-. gerous' situation, by what you did to save me."    * "But do you know--oh, do you know how happy it has -made me?  Can you divine how my heart--yes, my soul-burns with the joy it 'has given me? .When I saw you standing-there be- fore your enemies so beautiful! so calm I so constant-I felt that I could die for you-that I would die for you. -And when I sprang between you and your pursuers, I had resolved to die for you.

"Yes, Edith--don't you understand, that after what I have done-after what I have had the joy of doing-the only honor- able course left open to me, is to go and give myself up to answer the charges that may be brought against me?" "Oh, Heaven! I know I know what you have incurred by defending me I know the awful penalty laid upon a military officer who lifts his hand against his superior. Don't go I oh, don't go!"

"'Take an interest' in my generous protector I How should I help it? Ohl don't gol Don't think of going. You will not-will you?

In the meantime Cloudesley Mornington had gone out to   YOUNG    AMERICA    IN  1814.    65 despatch Thorg if needful. But when he reached the side of- his fallen foe, the body lay so still that Cloudesley believed it dead. He did not like to strike a corpse--but to kill Thorg-- to make sure of his death, Cloudesley was resolved-he thought it his duty--he felt it his duty-just as men feel it incumbent upon them to slay any cruel beast of prey-fallen into their power.' So Cloudesley stood over the monster, with his weapon raised, watching with some curiosity and interest for some sign of life,. and recovery that should invite the descending blow. He had watched some minutes--occasionally pushing the body with his foot, and scrutinizing the brutal and ferocious face with some- thing of a physiognomist's interest, when the monster suddenly made a great spasmodic heave and plunge-settled himself still -again and opened his eyes. In an instant Cloudesley's foot was planted on his chest, and the point of his sword placed against his throat. "I believed that you were dead or you never would have opened your eyes again! Say your prayers I Make your peace with Heaven, for your hour has come!" The miscreant attempted to struggle-feebly, stupidly, in- effectually, for he was half dead, and the pressure of the point of that sword against his throat was dangerous, might be instantly fatal, and it warned him to be still. "Say your prayers I Make your peace with Heaven if you can, for in five minutes your soul will be in eternity 1" "Cloudesley I Cloudesley!" The young man raised his eyes to see Edith standing opposite to him. "Cloudesley I Spare that man I Do not send his soul to God with such a load of sin upon it 1" "Go into the house, dearest Edith!" "No, not yet I I dare not, Cloudesley I spare that man!

AT   of                   .t   YOUNG    AMERICA    IN  1814.  , 67 Cloudesley sheathed his sword and removed his foot from the chest of the wounded man. Just then the young ensign was seen approaching leading:Mxs horse, but looking frightfully ill, and walking with pain and difficulty. "You are not going to leave us, sir?" asked Cloudesley. "I am under the necessity of doing so." "But you are not able to travel-you can scarcely sit youri horse. Pray do not think of leaving us." "You are a soldier-at least an amateur one, and you -will; understand that after what has occurred, I must not seem to hide myself like a fugitive from justice!  In short, I must go and answer for that which I have done." "I understand, but really, sir, you look very ill-you-" But here the young officer held out his hand smilingly, took leave of Cloudesley, and bowing low to Edith, rode off. Cloudesley and Edith followed the gallarnt fellow with their eyes. He had nearly reached the gate, the old green gate at the farthest end of the semi-circular avenue, when the horse stopped, the rider reeled and fell from, his saddle. Cloudesley and Edith ran towards him-reached him. Cloudesley disen- tangled- his foot from the stirrup, and^raised him in his arms. Edith stood pale and breathless by. "He has fainted I I knew he was suffering extreme pain. Edith I fly and get some water I 0t rather here I sit down and, hold up his head while I go." Edith was quickly down by the side of her preserver, support- ing his head upon her breast. Cloudesley sped towards the house for water and assistance. When he procured what he wanted and returned, he met the troop of collegians on their return from the chase of the retreating marauders.", They reported that they had scattered the fugitives in every direc-) tion and lost them in the labyrinths of the forest. They were tremendously elatedwith their victory. The victorv of school- boys over regular troops. British troops I That was the way they chose to consider it.

Yet, nevertheless, the boys were fairly delirious with the pride of their first victory. When they saw the young British officer upon the ground, supported in the arms of Edith, they rejoiced over another pri- soner, as they thought. Two prisoners of war taken by their party! two ofcers, and one the notorious Thorg I That was almost too much glory for the heads of boys to bear sanely I Several of them dismounted and gathered around the young ensign. But Cloudesley was now upon the spot, and while he bathed the face of the fainting man, explained to them how it was, and requested some one to ride immediately to the village and pro- cure a physician. Thurston Willcoxen, the next in command under him, and his chosen brother-in-arms, mounted his horse and galloped off. A mattrass was in the meantime brought down, the wounded man laid carefully upon it, and borne by the boys to the man- sion house. He was laid upon a cot in one of the parlors. A young medical student among the youths, sending the crowd from the bedside, proceeded to open his dress and examine his wound, to do what he could for him before the arrival of the doctor. Edith retired from the room, and sent old Jenny to his as- sistance. Old Jenny, since recovering from her swoon, had been walking about "settling things up," mechanically, like one in a dream. Edith found herself alone with Cloudesley, for a few mo- ments. "Tell me, Cloudesley," she said, "how it was that you came go opportunely to our relief?"   YOUNG    A M E R I C A  IN  8- 14.  69 "Why, you see, Edith, this morning we fellows were lat our military exercises, in the academy grounds, when the-news came of the massacre at Hay Hill. As soon as we heard it, I rode up to the head of our company, and turning and facing them, I said, 'Soldiers, attend I9 And they attended. 'You have, heard of the inhuman outrages at Hay Hill.' \ They had heard. ' Then draw your swords.' And they drew. ' Throw away the scabbards.' And they threw. ' Raise their points to Heaven.' And they raised. 'Bow your heads.' And they bowed. 'Now swear by the sacred love you bear your mothers, sisters and sweethearts, never to sheath your blades until you sheath them in English flesh.? And they swore. 'Now cry, "God for Harry, England and St. George 1"No I thunder and blazes I that aint it I I mean, God for vengeance, Fannie, and Hay Hill!" ' And they cried. ' Now, right face I quick step I for- ward I march ' And they marched. And here we are. We came, we saw, we conquered." "But the doctors! I wonder they did not feel a great re- sponsibility in letting you come!" "Oh, the Big Wigs did try to stop us. But they were not in time. You see, when they saw me from the house haranguing my men, they thought we were only exercising as usual. But when they saw the company defiling down the road, they came running out in a body-old Grim at their head--to see, what was the matter. They ordered us in. But soldiers know their duty better. I addressed them. 'If any man over thir- teen years of age deserts his ranks at this crisis, he shall be forever expelled from this company, and from the society of all honorable men, and shall be considered a 'pshaw I 'a nuisance in - the noses of fellows forever and ever' I The majority stood by me-many even of, the little fellows insisted on going with us- and some great lubberly babies of nineteen, went back with the professors."

That the house would be attacked, and there was no one there but Miss Edith to defend it. She said she had started to go to C--, and get us to come for this very purpose-that she could not bear for Miss Edith to suffer, whatever might befall Luckenough!"

"EDITH I should not hesitate to announce the fact to a young lady of less resolution than yourself, but my dear Lady Castellainel we must fortify this 'castle' as well as -we can against a possible renewal of the attack, for the probability is those rascals--I beg your pardon, Edith-may report their own defeat, and our weakness, and return with a reinforcement to burn or batter down these walls over our heads. So, I believe - I must go and see the other fellows, Edith, and consult what is best to be done," said Cloudesley Mornington, touching his -cap ,o the. young lady of the mansion, as he left her.   EDITH'S   LO-VE.        7T Cloudesley went to call a council of war in the saloon. Edith glided softly to the door of the parlor, where, stretched upon a cot, lay her wounded champion. But though she list. ened attentively, all was so still within, that she could 'heam nothing of his condition. After a little anxious listening, and a little awkward hesitation, she tapped softly at the door, and brought out Solomon Weismann, the young medical student, before mentioned. "How is-is--Thorg " asked the maiden. "Thorg--oh \I-he?-why, he is seriously injured-a contu- sion of the cerebellum, and concussion of the cerebrum, de- priving him for the present of the powers of volition and sensation, and threatening to terminate in death. - He is now lying on a cot in the next room to this of the young ensign, in a comatose state, with a half a peck of ice about his head, and half a peck of mustard about his extremities. May destiny baffle the utmost skill of medical science! in his case! -I feel it my duty to do all that can be .done to save him, but I hope it may fail, that's all." "You must not encourage such feelings in your heart-for the purity and nobility of your own soul, you must not'. But- your other patient?" "The young ensign? Oh! He is very dreadfully injured, indeed, Miss Lance," replied the youth, who, knowing nothing of the circumstance of his patient's having received his. inju- ries in Edith's defence, could not guess that she' :should "take any deep interest in his fate. "Has his wound been dressed?-is he 'suffering much?"' asked Edith, in a tremulous voice. . "Why, yes--to both of your questions II have dressed: his wound as well as circumstances will admit, but he is:ssuffering extremely; must be, you know, Miss Lance. You see, his in- jury is a very complicated one-it is at once a punctured, contused, and lacerated wound-tearing the pectoralis-minor,' shattering the third and fourth ribs, with the intercostal mus- cles, near their articulation with the second os-st-ernum, aind  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7871-00000029"/> 72     THE  MSSING   BRIDE.. driving the-splintered bones through the pleura-costalis, and the pleura-pulmonalis into the parenchyma," answered the young student, making the most of the occasion to display his science. "But--is that-a very dangerous wound or not? I think I don't quite understand," said Edith, faintly. "Well, I judge it to be a very bad thing, Miss Lance, when the ribs are broken and driven into the substance of the lungs." "Oh!" gasped the young girl, with a painful start) as if she herself had received a bayonet thrust through the bosom. The medical student went pitilessly on, regardless of the pain he was inflicting- "High inflammation and fever has set in, and he is suffering excruciating agony." "I hope-you are mistaken-I did not hear--him groan- once," faltered Edith. "Why, no 1 'really, he shows the most marvellous fortitude- while I was examining and probing his wound, and picking out little splinters of bone from the pleura, and taking up an ar- tery, and closing up the ragged gash-though his lips were white, and his brow knitted with the mortal agony, not a groan escaped him I no, not one! I could not help admiring him, enemy to our country as he is I'" Edith was unconsciously wringing and compressing her hands. "But-the wound is not mortal-not mortal?" "Why, what a tender heart you have, Miss Edith, to feel so much compassion for a wounded enemy. Suppose it had been one of our countrymen-yes 1 suppose it had been me? Why, the shock would have killed you 1" "But the wound is not mortal-you--said so--didn't you?" "Of course I did not, Miss Lance. Certainly the wound is mortal; but you need not distress your kind heart about it, for though we shall do all that we possibly can to alleviate his suf- ferings, yet still we must consider that he is our country's enemy, and therefore I should think you need not lay awake, to-night, thinking of his misery, or go into mourning for him when he dies."   EDITH' S   LOVE.        73 "Oh, I wish, I wish the surgeon would come! I When do you think he will come? You are so young, so inexperienced, you cannot be an infallible judge--you may be mistaken. Oh-  when do you think the doctor will be here?" "It is impossible for me to say, Miss Lance," 'replied Solo- mon, piqued at her distrust of his own skill; "I do not know -but what I do know is, that the doctor cannot do much when he does come. And whether -he gets here to-night or not, I can tell you how it will all end. The inflammation must in"- crease, and the fever rise until it reaches delirium, and his ex- cruciating agonies must continue to augment until mortification sets in, when the pain will abate, and the fever subside, and an easy death close the scene. This will probably take place some time to-morrow morning. Anything more you wish to know, Miss Lance?" "Nol no It" The young man disappeared within, closing the door after him. A short gasp, a suppressed sob, and Edith leaned, half faints ing, against the wainscotting. Presently she heard wheels roll up to the door and stop. She looked up. It was the carriage of the surgeon, whom she saw alight and walk up the steps. She went to meet him, com- posedly as she could, and conducted him to the door of the sick room, which he entered. Edith remained in the hall, softly walking up and down, and sometimes pausing to listen. After a little, the door openeid: It Was only Solomon Weis- mann, who asked for warm water, lint, and a quantity of old linen. These Edith quickly supplied, and then remained alone in the hall, walking up and, down, and pausing to listen ass be- fore; once- she heard a deep shuddering groan, as of one in mortal extremity, and her own heart and frame thrilled to the sound, and then all was still as before..       ' An hour, two hours, passed, and then the door opened again, and Edith caught a glimpse of the surgeon, 'with his shirt sleeves pushed above his elbows, and a pair-of bloody hands, it                    "A  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7871-00000030"/> 74      T H E ME I S S I N G B R I D E. It was Solomon who opened the door to ask for a basin of, water, towels and soap, for the doctor to wash. Edith fur- nished these also. Half an hour passed, and the door opened a third time, and the doctor himself came out, fresh and smiling. His counte- nance and his manner were in every respect encouraging. "Come into the'drawing-room a moment, if you please, Miss Edith, I want to speak with you." Edith desired nothing more, just at that moment. "Well, doctor-your patient?" she inquired, anxiously. "Will do very well I Will do very well I That is, if he be properly attended to, and that is what I wished to speak to you about, Miss Edith. I have seen you near sick beds before this, my dear, and know that I can better trust you than any one to whom I could at present apply. I intend to instal you as his nurse, my dear. When a life depends upon your care, you will waive any scruples you might otherwise feel, Miss Edith, I am sure I You will have your old- maid, Jenny, to assist you, and Solomon at hand, in case of an emergency. But I intend to delegate my authority, and leave my directions with you." "Yes, doctor, I will do my very best for your patient."' - "I am sure of that. I am sure of that." She wished to tell him that the invalid was her preserver, and had received the wound in defending her from his own party, but it was a long, eloquent story, in Edith's apprehen- sion; she would not interrupt his directions by alluding to it now-she would do full justice to it another time. Now she wanted to receive his orders and ask some questions. "t His wound, doctor, is not dangerous then?" "Well-no, Miss Edith, if he is properly nursed." "Solomon Weismann told me the wound was a very terrible one," said Edith, repeating the description he had given of the injury. The. doctor laughed. "Solomon is a pedantic fooll and bent upon astonishing everybody with his knowledge."   EDITtH'S   LOV E. :H7 "Sarvunt, sir I Beg your pardon, marster, fer interruptin' o' you I but you 'low how Marse Solomun Weismann was not sensible o' his 'fession?" inquired Jenny, appearing at the door with a scrap of paper in her hand, which she studied very dubiously. "Well, now, Aunty, I rather think it is no concern of yours." "'Deed, beg your pardon, marster, it's a- heap o' 'cern o' mine.

The doctor was giving Edith his last directions. "Above all things, Miss Lance, the patient must be kept i entirely free from heat and excitement of all kinds-he must be kept perfectly still and cool, yet not too cool-you must use your judgment. You will find the same directions, together with my written orders for the regulation of his medicine and diet for the next twenty-four hours, on this paper." ' And the doctor placed in her hands a folded slip, and took his departure. Edith was glad to have the privilege--nay, the duty of nurs- ing her invalid. Yet she felt by no means at ease. She knew the doctor's way of old-how, with his cheerful, hopeful temper, and encouraging, flattering tongue, he was just as apt to put too fair a face upon matters as Mr. Solomon was to put too dark a one. She had often heard it said of the doctor, "Oh I Doctor Brightwell, though the best doctor in the world, will ,never own that there is anything serious the matter until the patient is in the grave l" Edith knew it to be true of him, too. And so it was not with the lightest of hearts that she en- tered the sick room of her patient. She was relieved from the deep despondency into which Solomon's report had thrown her, but not from anxiety. She prepared the iced tamarind water the doctor had ordered to cool his burning thirst, and placed it on a-: stand at hand, and then she took a large feather fan and sat down to fan him--her present duty being to keep him cool, yet to keep his chest covered carefully, lest the least air should penetrate to that dreadful wound, and to give him drink when- ever he needed it. Since the fatigue and pain of the second and thorough examination and. dressing, the surgeon had found it necessary to give the wound after his clumsy student, the patient had fallen into the sleep of exhaustion. But his face was flushed with rising fever, his slumber was restless--he mur. mured in his disturbed dreams, and threw about his left arm; b his right -arm, though itself uninjured, was bound down, lest its slightest motion should disturb the wound upon that side. He needed the closest watching, the most vigilant attention, such as only one so interested in his life as'Edith was would give   EDITH'S LOVE.           77- him. He awoke several times in the course of the evening, and took the drink from her hands, but never recognized his purse. He called her "Marian," and "dearest Marian." But never "Edith i' Edith, and the scenes of the last few hours, seemed to have passed from his memory. As his fever rose, the poor girl's heart sank, she thought Solomon's prophecy was about to be fulfilled. The long, gawky figure, red head, and freckied face of the medical-student frequently appeared at the door, and once dur- ing the evening he relieved her watch, while she went put to. give some orders to Jenny and Oliver. "And I likes for to know, Miss Edy, what we-demgot to get for dem dar boys' suppers-? Dey aint had the fust bit o' dinner, an' is as hungry as houn' dogs," said the latter. And indeed it was a serious consideration. There were some thirty youth; and the provisions of the garrison of Lnckenough were not extensive-the first evacuating party under Commo- dore Waugih having carried off nearly all the edibles Edith was nonplussed. "If I kills all de chickens as is left, and cooks all de bacon and eggs, der'll be enough for, to-night and to-morrow mornin'. But what de debbil we-dem gwine do arter dat r "Oh, well I if there's enough for the present, use it, Jenny, and to-morrow we can send to some of the neighbors and get provisions." So this matter was settled, and Edith resumed her watch.                    .  ' Sh'e watched by his cot through all the night, fanning him softly, keeping his chest covered from the air, giving. him 'his medicine at the proper intervals, and putting drink to his lips when he needed it. But never trusted her eyelids to close for a moment.  Jenny shared her vigil by nodding in an easy chair; and the young'medical student by sleeping soundly on the wooden settee in the hall. So passed the night. After' midnight, to Edith's great relief, his fever began to abate, and he sunk into a sweet sleep. In the morning Solomon roused himself, and came in and relieved Edith's watch,' and attended 5              ; *'  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7871-00000032"/> 78      THE .

Two of the professors from the academy came in search of their pupils. They explained that they should have come the evening before had not the return of Doctor Brightwell to the village, and his report of the state of affairs at Luckenough, put them at ease in respect to their charge. The professors reported that the British forces were far on their march to Washington City, and the neighborhood was for the present delivered from their com- pany. The lads were then mustered, the roll called, and all being found right, they departed with the professors once Tore for "Academic Shades."  And Edith and her patient, with Jenny and Oliver, who attended Thorg, were left alone in the hall. She prepared the light, nutritious food he was permitted to partake, and placed it on the stand by the bedside ready for him, when he should awake, and then resumed her seat beside him to fan him, and to watch the refreshing sleep into which he had fallen. No mother ever watched her child with more care and tenderness. How she thanked Heaven for that restoring sleep, and for the deep, cool quiet of the whole house, so favorable to the sufferer. The back windows of the room -were open, but the thick branches of the old elm trees made a dark, pleasant shade, and the cool breeze murmured low, slumbrous music through the rustling leaves as it came into the room. Everything was so soothing and refreshing to the invalid, and she so quietly rejoiced in it. How strangely-how suddenly this new interest had entered her soul. Twenty-four hours ago, and she had never known the existence of this generous, noble boy, who now occupied all her thoughts. Twenty-four hours ago she had not seen his face, and now that beautiful countenance, with the elegant Hebrew profile-the high, pale forehead, crested with raven black ringlets, the acquiline nose with the thin, quivering nos-   EDITH'S   LOVE. i tril, the short, haughty upper lip, and the superbly curved chin the dark, flashing eyes, " like the eagle's, yet sometimes liki the dove's"--the eyes that had blazed with such insufferable light when defending her, yet softened into such ineffable ten. -derness when speaking to her--the whole beautiful, spirited, yet gentle countenance, -seemed familiar and dear as though'it had always -been associated with her Bife, and indispensable to its happiness. Towards noon he opened his eyes, turned them around the room, and slowly came to the consciousness of his position. His wandering glance fell upon Edith, and softened and bright- ened as it were at once. With a smile fall of almost child-like surprise and delight, he stretched out his hand to her. "Are you nursing me, dear lady? this is very good." "How do you feel now?" asked Edith, taking the hand that he held out; It was rather feverish, and she began to sponge it with cold water. "I am   better, I think, gentle lady. I thank you very much."                      ,   , His voice was faint, he spoke with difficulty, and after saying that, spoke only with his eloquent eyes, while Edith bathed his hands and face, and placed his little refreshment to his lips. In the midst of this the surgeon arrived, and entered the hall in a little smothered bustle.   / Edith went out to receive him. He had brought along with him an elderly lady from the village--one Miss Nancy Skamp--, a  distant relative of his own, who, he told Edith, would remain. with her as long as she needed her company and assistance. Miss Nancy had gone up stairs in charge of Jenny, to take  off her bonnet and " things." Edith accompanied the doctor to the sick room. He re- ceived Edith's report, praised her skill, examined the condition- of his patient, and wassorry to find him not so, well as he had' hoped and expected. There appeared to be much inflamma. tion, and the fever was rising again. Edith supplied the doctor with everything requisite for the i        u . , fo  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7871-00000033"/> THE  MSSING   BR IDE.  re-dressing of the wound, sent Jenny in to wait upon him, and then went out td welcome Miss Nancy Skamp, who was now coming down the stairs. Miss Nancy, by-the-way, was "own aunt" and sole proprie- tress of Mr. Solomon Skamp Weismann, the promising young aspirant to medical honors. She was like him, too. They were ' like as two pins," the neighbors said. The same tall, bony figure-the same red hair-the same fair, freckled skin-- the same sharp, thin features, which, nevertheless, gave a mas- culine look to the old lady's face, and a feminine air to the young gentleman's. Miss Nancy piqued herself upon her own and her nephew's red hair and freckles-they were the signs, she said, of the very purest Saxon blood--none of your Celtic, or other inferior races, ever freckled or had red hair. In talking with Edith, Miss Nancy corroborated the report made by the professors in the morning-the British forces had entirely left the neighborhood-that was ascertained beyond all doubt. "But, oh I wasn't that the awfullest massacree at Hay Hill, Miss Edith?" "Horrible, indeed And who could have foreseen it?" said Edith, shuddering. "Why, most any one, Miss Edith, I should think I It has always been my opinion, when people come to bad ends it's their own faults. Now, there's Fanny Fairlie--" "Dearest Fanny I has anything been heard of her since that night?" "No, nothing certain. They do say she was seen rambling about in the woods; as miad as a March. hare. The two old negroes that escaped massacreeinfg, you know, are staying at Old Fields, with Mrs. L'Olseau. It seems to me she has enough to feed, poor lady, without them." The doctor now entered, to leave new directions with Edith and Miss Nancy, and to take his departure. He said he should send Solomon over that night, to sit up with the sick man.   ,    ,   EDITII'S LOVE.   So, towards evening, according to promise, Mr. Solomon arrived. And soon after supper Miss Nancy obliged Edith and her two fatigued attendants to go to their several apart- : merits. For some time after Edith lay down, she was kept awake by that strong nervous excitability induced by loss of sleep, and it was midnight when at last she sunk into a fitful and perturbed  slumber. About two hours after she was awakened by the  s sound of groans. She sat upto listen. It was her patient, who was groaning and tossing, and talking to himself, and no one seeming to pay the slightest attention to him. Edith arose quickly, slipped on her dressing-gown, and went into his room. There sat the aunt and nephew sound asleep. And there rolled and tossed the wounded man, wild with fever, pain-and burning thirst. Edith gave him the cooling beverage, and sponged his head and face and hands with aromatic vinegar. But the fierce heat of the fever dried up the moisture without being cooled by it, and he still raved and tossed in high delirium. Edith was very much alarmed. She roused up Mr. Solomon, and sent him, on horsback, to the village for the doctor: And then she woke up Miss Nancy, Who had slept through all this, and whose first words, when she opened her eyes, were, ,  "Ah!l I am glad you have come, Miss Edith, for I have not  closed my eyes all night, and I'm all but worn' out; so now, honey, if you'll just take my place, I'll go and try to get some sleep." And rising and yawning, she walked away.  Edith let her depart, and waked up Jenny in her stead. The  patient's delirium rose to frenzy; 'and it began to be as much as Jenny and Oliver, who was called to her assistance, coud do to keep him in the bed. The doctor came at sunrise. :-He administered such 'remedies' as his skill and experience sug- ' ; gested, but ascribed the whole mischief to the first unskillfl  dressing of. the wound by Solomon, and said that he was sfLte some extraneous substance had been permittedto work its way   &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7871-00000034"/> 82      T HE   MSS I N G  BRIDE. into the lungs, where no one knew the extent of the evil it might now, or eventually cause. Be that as it might, the present sufferings of the patient were terrible. And for days life was despaired of. The most skillful medical treatment,- and the most careful nursing only, had scarcely saved his life. And even after the imminent danger was over, it was weeks before he was able to be lifted from the bed to the sofa.   i In the-meantime, Thorg recovered, and prepared to leave the house. He took quite an affectionate leave of the young ensign, and with an appearance of great friendliness and ho- nesty, promised to interest himself, at head-quarters, in'behalf of the young officer. This somehow filled Edith with a vague distrust, and dark foreboding, for which she could neither ac- count, nor excuse; herself, nor yet shake off. Thorg had been exchanged, and he joined his regiment after its return from Washington City, and before it sailed from the- shores of America. Weeks passed, during which 'the invalid occupied the sofa in his room-and Edith was his sole nurse; Miss Nancy Skamp having left the house. And then Commodore Waugh, with his ' wife, servants, and caravan, returned to Luckenough. The old soldier had been ",posted up," he said, relative to all that had transpired in his absence. There were no words, he declared, to express his admiration of Edith's " heroism."  It was in vain that Edith assured him that she had not been heroic at all-that the preservation of Luckenough had been due rather to the timely succor of the college boys, than t9 her own imprudent resolution. It did no good--the old man was determined to look upon his niece as a heroine worthy to stand by the side of Joan of Arc. , "For," said he, "was it not the soul of a heroine, that en- ? abled her to stay and guard the house; and would the college ' company ever have come to the rescue of these old walls, if they i had not heard that she had resolutely remained to guard them,   E DI T H'S  TROUBLES.         83 and was almost alone in the house?

Yet all this, filled Edith with the greatest uneasiness and foreboding-ungrateful, incomprehensi- ble, yet impossible to be delivered from. CH A PTER  VI. EDITH'S  TROUBLES.

But you had waited for me so long, and were so fond of me. Howeve! I won't hit you in the teeth with it, Old Honey. But now about Edith! If she must fall in love I I want to know why in the mischief she don't fall in love with Grim'? Now, Grim' is what I call a man for any woman's eye, that is, if Iknow anything about women 1" "Which you don't!" "Isn't he a very handsome man, now " "In his own opinion.'  "Well, he is very learned, that you'll admit?" /' Pedantic, you mean." "And very religious!" "Self-righteous." "Oh-h-hl" roared the Commodore, thrusting forward his head, and striking his stick upon the floor; I vow to heaven, Old Hen, you'd be-devil an angel." "Yes!, angels of darkness 1" "I uphold that Grim' is a perfect man" - "Ohl yes! Professor Grimshaw is perfectly intolerable I Edith feels that as well as I do." "Intolerable upon what account, I should like to be in- formed? -If he were ugly, or deformed, or stupid, or poor, I could comprehend it; but he is a man of good looks, good parts, and good prospects 1" "Yes! but women don't necessarily fall in love with a man's beauty, intellect, or social advantages." "With what then, I want very much to know! With his ugliness, or stupidity, or forlornity, I suppose?" "Just as likely as not." "Oh-h-h!" bellowed Old Nick, thrusting forward his great head, and ramming his stick into the floor, "O-h-h-h! You pit- me past all my patience with your conceit, and your rash general rules.

Humph    Humph 1 Humph!" said Old Nick. There was a long pause after this. "Well, at last," said the old Commodore, "what I haxe re- solved upon is this-that Grim' shall be the master of Luck- enough, let who will be the mistress!" Then give it to him in the name of all that's ugly, but don't, for heaven's sake, tempt any of your poor nieces, through their necessities, or clog the gift with the burden of an un- willing and unacceptable wife. As for Edith, her heart's in- tegrity is incorruptible-and Doctor Grimshaw himself, occupies his thoughts as little with Edith as she does with him." "Now, that's what I call confounded perversity and ingrati- tude, when they know how it would please me, and my good intentions towards them. What the mischief should ail Grim' and Edith, not to fall in love with each other, when I desire it?" "Because honest hearts are not to be bought, or sold, or persuaded." "Oh-h-h!" blowed Old Nick, "I'm tired of all the eon- founded nonsense I but I know what I'll do." Here the conversation ended. From the foregoing dialogue, you will see how affairs stood at Luckenough. It was late in the spring, Mr. Shields had re- ceived orders to join his regiment in Canada, and upon their reception, he had had an explanation with Edith, and with her permission, had requested her hand of her uncle, Commodore Waugh. This threw the veteran into a towering passion, and nearly drove him from his proprieties as host. The young ensign was unacceptable to him upon every account. First and foremost, he wasn't "Grim." Then he was an Israelite. And, lastly! horror of horrors I he was a British officer, and dared to aspire to 'the hand of Edith. It was in vaia that his wife, the good Henrietta, tried to mollify him; the storm raged for several days-raged, till it had expended all its strength, and subsided from exhausotion. Then he came, as he alirt w  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7871-00000036"/> THEE  MSSING    BRIDE.  ultimately did, under the influence of Henrietta's calm tempera- ment and better judgment. First of all, she assured him that "what will be, will be," that whether he opposed -or favored the match, it would finally come off, that love is ho respecter of persons, prejudices 'or creeds-that any one could see that two such lovely, excellent beings as Edith and Shields, were created for each other, and would make a "matchless pair." If he did not contradict her, he assented silently, or with a grunt-a bearish, sullen sort of assent-and he took his resolu- tion. Soon after this he summoned Edith to his presence. 'Come here, huzzy I Sol you're determined, are you, to marry this young rascal P Edith cast her eyes on the ground, but did not speak. "Well, I am to take your silence for assent, I suppose? Very good. Now, here is my ultimatum. I am no tyrant, minion, do you hear! I oppose nobody's freedom of will--not I I I let every fool do as they like; only I claim the privilege of doing as I like also. God Almighty gave man so much free agency, that he may redeem and sanctify-himself, if he pleases, or damn himself to all eternity, if he likes that better I Hea- ven save me from the sin of depriving one of His creatures of their meed of liberty I Therefore, Miss Edith Lance I marry, if you like, and whom you like. You are of age I But hear, in that case, what I shall do. I have hitherto made no secret of my intentions towards you. They were, to have made you the heiress of all my possessions. Now all I have to say to you is this-that if you will have the good sense to marry Mr. Grimshaw, these intentions shall be more than fulfilled-they shall be anticipated." Upon your marriage with Grimshaw, I will give you a conveyance of Luckenough-only reserving to myself and Old Hen a house, and a life-support in the place; but if you will persist in your foolish preference for that;young scamp, I will give you-nothing.

"That is all-is it not, uncle? You will not deprive me of any portion of your love: will you, uncle?" "I do not know, Edith I I cannot tell; when you ,have deli berately chosen one of your own fancy, in preference to one of mine-the man I care most for in the world, and whom I chose especially foi you; why, you've speared me right through a very tender part; however, as I said before, what you do, do quickly! I cannot bear to be kept upon the tenter hooks 1" "I will talk with Michael, uncle," said Edith, meekly. She went out, and found him pacing the lawn at the back of the house. He turned towards her with a glad smile, took her hand as she approached him, and pressed it to his lips. "Dearest Edith, where have you been so long?" "With my uncle, Michael. I have my uncle's ' ultimatum,' as he calls it." "What is it, Edith?" "Ahl how shall I tell you without offence? But, dearest Michael, you will not mind-you will forgive an old man's childish prejudices, especially when you know they are not per- sonal-but circumstantial, national, bigoted." "Well, Edith! well?" "Michael, he says-he says that I may give you my hand--" "Said he so bless that fair hand, and bless him who be- stows it 1' he exclaimed, clasping her fingers and pressing them to his lips. ' Yes, Michael, but-." . "But what I there is no but; he permits you to give me your hand; there is then no but--' a jailor to bring forth some mon- strous malefactor.'"      .  "Yet listen!

Now he disinherits me, unless I consent to be married to his friend and favorite, Dr. Grimshaw." "You put the case gently and delicately, dear Edith, but the hard truth, is this--is it not-that he will disinherit you,-if you consent to be mine? You need not answer me, dearest Edith, if you do not wish to; but listen-I have nothing but my sword, and beyond my boundless love, nothing to offer you but the wayward fate of a soldier's wife. Your eyes are full of tears. Speak, Edith Lance can you share the soldier's wan- dering life? Speak, Edith, or lay your hand in mine. Yet, no I no I no I am selfish and unjust. Take time, love, to think of all you abandon, all that you may encounter in join- ing your fate to mine. God knows what it has cost me to say it-but-take time, Edith," and he pressed and dropped her hand. "I do not need to do so. My answer to-day, to-morrow, and forever, must be the same," she answered, in a very low voice; and her eyes sought the ground, and the blush deepened on her cheek, as she laid her hand in his. How he pressed that white hand to his lips, to his heart I how he clasped her to his breast I how he vowed to love and cherish her as the dearest treasure of his life, need not here be told. Edith said ' Now take me in to uncle, and tell him, for he asked me not to keep him in suspense." Michael led her into the hall, where the Commodore strode up and down, making the old rafters tremble and quake with every tread-puffing-blowing over his fallen hopes, like a nor'-wester over the dead leaves. Michael advanced, holding the hand of his affianced, and modestly announced their engagement. "Humph 1 So the precious business is concluded, is it?" "Yes, sir," said Michael, with a bow.

"When shall I say, dearest Edith?" asked Michael, stooping to her ear. "When uncle pleases," murmured the girl. "Uncle pleases nothing, and will have nothing to do with it, except to advise as early a day as possible," he blurted out; "what says the bride?" "Answer, dearest Edith," entreated Michael Shields. "Then let it be at New-Year," said Edith, falteringly. "Whew Hsix months ahead I Entirely too far offl" ex- claimed the Commodore. "And so it really is, beloved," whispered Michael. "Let it be next week," abruptly broke in the Commodore. "What's the use of putting it off? Tuesdays and Thursdays are the marrying days, I believe; let it then be Tuesday or Thursday." "Tuesday," pleaded Michael. "Thursday," murmured Edith. "The deuce!-if you can't decide, I must decide for you," growled Old Nick, storming down towards the extremity of the hall, and roaring-"Old Hen Old Hen these fools are to be spliced on SUNDAY I Now bring me my pipe ;" and the Com- modore withdrew to his sanctum. Good Henrietta came in, took the hand of the young ensign, and pressed it warmly, saying that he would have a good wife, and wishing them both much happiness in their union. i he drew Edith to her bosom, and kissed her fondly, but in ^ silence. As this was Friday evening, little preparations could be. made for the solemnity to take place on Sunday.- Yet Mrs. Henrietta exerted herself to do all possible honor to the occa- sion.

She even invited a few particular friends to meet the bridal pair at dinner, on their return from church. The little interval between this and Sunday morning, was passed by Edith and Shields in making arrangements for their future course.  Sunday came. A young lady of the neighborhood officiated as bridesmaid, and Cloudesley Mornington as groomsman. The ceremony was to be performed at the Episcopal Church, at Charlotte Hall. The bridal party set forward in two carriages. They were attended by the Commodore and Mrs. Waugh. They reached the church at an early hour, and the marriage was solemnized before the morning service. When the entries had been made, and the usual congratulations passed, the party returned to the carriages. Before entering his own, Commodore Waugh ap- proached that in which the bride and bridegroom were already. seated, and into which the groomsman was about to hand the bridesmaid. "Stay, you two, you need not enter just yet," said the old man, "I want to speak with Mr. Shields and his wife. Edith!" Edith put her head forward, eagerly. "I have nothing against you; but after what has occurred, I don't want to see you at Luckenough again. Good-bye 1" Then turning to Shields, he said, "I will have your own and your wife's goods forwarded to the hotel, here," and nodding gruffly, he strode away. Cloudesley stormed, Edith begged that the carriage might be delayed yet a little while. Vain Edith's hope, and vain Mrs. Waugh's expostulations, Old Nick was not to be mollified. He said that "those who pleased to remain with the new-married, couple, might do so-lhe should go home I They did as they liked, and he should do as heliked." Mrs. Waugh, Cloudesley, and the bridesmaid determined to stay. The Commodore entered his carriage, and was driven towards nome.  The party then adjourned to the hotel.

The young bridesmaid and Cloudesley also expressed their determination to stand by their friends to the last. Their patience was not put to a very long test. In a, few days a packet was to sail from Benedict to Baltimore, and the young couple took advantage of the opportunity, and departed, with the good wishes of their few devoted friends. Their destination was Toronto, in Canada, where the young ensign's regiment was quartered. i,( 4\i V ,C .t,   &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7871-00000039"/> PA-T"SECOND. P A RTE C         ]).

Makes such a joy unto the sight, As fills a parent's eyes with light--Coleridge. SEVERAL miles from the manor of Luckenough, upon a hill not far from the sea-coast, stood the cottage of the Old Fields. There was nothing sublime or beautiful, or in any respect attractive about the place, unless indeed the very dreariness of its aspect might have a curious interest for the chance traveler. The house was a small, square edifice, of dingy white, 'shaded by a single largH elm,' and surrounded by a somewhat dilapi- dited fence. Around it on all sides lay exhausted old fields, in a state of almost absolute sterility. Beyond them, landward, stretched the old forest of St. Mary's, and seaward, the beach, and the waters of the bay. : An attempt had been made to cultivate the miserable sojl nearest the house, and a garden of half-blighted vegetables, and ,a field of stunted -corn, that lay withering under the burning heat of an August sun, added to the unpromising appearance of the whole. In short, nothing could be more desolate and (9 2i   SANSS O U C I.          93 hopeless than the aspect of Old Fields' Cottage, at the' time of which we write. The house contained but two rooms, one on the ground floor, which served as kitchen, parlor, and sitting-room, and one just above, which, being nothing more than a loft, was, nevertheless the sleeping apartment of the whole family. The property was an appendage to the Manor of Luck- enough, and was at this time occupied by a poor relation of Commodore Waugh, his niece, Mary L'Oiseau, the widow of a French emigree. Mrs. L'Oiseau had but one child, a little girl, Jacquelina, now about eight or nine years of age. Commodore Waugh had given them the cottage to live in, with permission to make a living, if they could, out of the poor land attached to it. This was all the help he had afforded his poor niece, and all, as she said, that she could reasonably ex. pect from one who had so many dependants. For several years past the little property had afforded her a bare subsistence. And now this year the long drought had parched up her garden and corn-field, and her cows had failed in their yield of milk for the want of grass. It was upon a dry and burning day, near the last of Augtist, that Mary L'Oiseau and her daughter sat down to their frugal breakfast. And such a frugal breakfast I the cheapest tea, with brown sugar, and a corn cake baked upon the griddle, and a little butter-that was alll It was spread upon a plain pine table without a table-cloth. , :              J The furniture of the room was in keeping--a sanded floor, a chest of drawers, with a small looking-glass, ornamented by a, sprig of asparagus, a dresser of rough'pine shelves on the right of the fire-place, and a cupboard on the left, a half-dozen cup-bottomed chairs, a spinning-wheel, and a reel and-jaek, completed the appointments.

Why what you think I come all de x  way over her' if it wa'n't for to bring a letter or--somet'in' V" said Jenny, fumbling in her bosom, and producing the missive.

Mrs. L'Oiseau was devouring the contents of the letter, which ran thus- "Mary, My Dear   I feel as if I had somewhat neglected you, but, the truth is, my arm is not long enough to stretch from Luckenough to Old Fields. That being the case, and myself and Old Hen being rather lonesome since Edith's ungrate- ful desertion, we beg you to take little Jacko, and come and live with us as long as we may live-and of what may come after that we will talk at some other time. If you will be ready I will send the carriage for you on Saturday. "YourUTTncle Nick." Mrs. L'Oiseau read this letter with a changing cheek-when she finished it she folded and laid it aside in silence. As her humble old friend, Jenny, knew nothing of its contents, she did not feel quite justified in informing her just yet. "It was about Miss Edy's going away, wa'n't it, Miss Mary?" "Yes." "I knowed it 1"' Here the conversation dropped. And, Jenny, after kintly remaining "to clear up the breakfast things," took her leave and her departure. i: then Mary called to her side her child-her Jacquelina-her  Skais Souci--as for her gay, thoughtless temper she was called. I Would here describe the mother and daughter to you.  The mother needs little description-a pale, black-haired, black-eyed woman, who should have been blooming and sprightly, but that care had damped her spirits, and cankered the roses in her cheeks.                         , But Jacquelina-Sans Souci-merits a better portrait. She was small and flight for her years, and, though renlly-  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7871-00000041"/> 96      r THE  iMSSING   BRIDE. near nine, would have been taken for six or seven. She was fair-skinned, blue-eyed and golden-haired. And her countenance, full of spirit, courage, and audacity. As she would dart her face upward towards the sun, her round, smooth, highly polished white forehead would seem to laugh in light between its cluster' ing curls of burnished gold, that, together with the little, slightly turned up nose, and short, slightly protruded upper lip, gave the charm of inexpressible archness to the'most mischievous countenance alive. In fact her whole form, features, expression, and gestures seemed instinct with mischief-mischief lurked in the kinked tendrils of her bright hair; mischief looked out and laughed in the merry, malicious blue eyes; mischief crept slyly ovei the bows of her curbed and ruby lips; and mischief played at hide and seek among the rosy dimples of her blooming cheeks. Her eager, restless spirit gave a startling quickness, abrupt- : ness, and eccentricity to all her motions; yet such was the ineffable grace of every movement, uniting smoothness with swiftness, that she reminded the beholder of some beautiful bird or frolicsome kid. She seldom walked, but ran or darted like a lap-wing-with this peculiarity-her figure leaning forward, and her bright head dipping downward in the swiftness of her flight. She would generally impress you with two distinct feelings. When she happened to be stlL-with the idea of danger, as in the proximity of gunpowder, an evil spirit, or, at the very. least, of a most artful and dangerous monkey, whose devices it were impossible to foresee, or forestall. And when she chanced to be active, she inspired you with the hunterls instinct to chase, catch, and delight in her captuge, just as if she had been some wild bird darting from bush to bush, or some wanton doe abandoning herself to a delirium of play. Upon the present occasion, Madam L'Oiseau found Sans Souci swinging up and down upon the lowest limber branch of the old elm that overshadowed the house. She called her in, and with sBarcely restrained joy, communicated to her the contents of her   SA NS  sOUCI.          97 uncle's note, and the vague hopes of future inheritance they in - spired-concluding with, "t Now, Jacquelina, you must cure yourself of these hoydenish tricks of yours before you expose them to your uncle--remember how whimsical and eccentric he is."  "So am I! Just as whimsicall I'll do him dirt," said the young lady. { Good Heaven I Where did you ever pick up such a phrase, and what upon earth does doing any one' dirt ' mean?" asked the very much shocked lady. "I mean I'll grind his nose on the ground, I'll hurry him and worry him, and upset him, and cross him, and make him run his head against the wall, and butt- his blundering brains out. What did he turn Fair Edith away for? Oh I I'll pay him offl I/'/ settle with him I Fair Edith shan't be in his debt for her injuries very long." From her pearly brow and pearly cheeks, "Fair Edith" was the name by which the child had heard her cousin once called; and she had called her thus ever since. Mrs. L'Oiseau answered gravely, "Your uncle gave Edith aTfair choice between his own love and protection, and the great benefits he had in store for her, and the love of a stranger and foreigner, whom he disapproved and hated. Edith deliberately chose the latter. And your uncle had a perfect right to act upon her unwise decision." "And for my part Iknow he hadnt--all of my own thoughts, Oh I I'll do him--"  "Hush I Jacquelina. You shall not use such expressions. So much comes of my letting you have your own way, running down to the beach and watching the boats, aud hearing the vul- gar talk of the fishermen."          - "'I know a tall young waterman-  - 1 know a handsome waterman--  I Enow a jolly waterman That sails upon the seal" sang the fairy, shaking her golden curls in the greatest- glee.  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7871-00000042"/> 98      THE  MSSING    BRIDE. She had a most beautiful voice, that gave an ineffable charm even to the most common-place words and air. "There I oh, Mary I just listen to her I all sorts of low songs and catches I Well thank Heaven, all this will be changed when you 'get to Luckenough I Dear me, I can hardly realize that we are going there. I don't realize it at all. It will be a very great change. Well, thank Heaven, at any rate it will be nearer the church, and we shall have the use of a carriage, and can go every Sunday. And, perhaps, your uncle will send you to school or get a teacher for you into the house. And who knows but he will make you his heiress, Jacquelina! You must try to please him."            ' "I'd as soon try to please Old SatanI And all to get his money, too 1 Do you think I'd try to cut Fair Edith out? Oh l Mimmy!" "Don't say 'cut-out,' that is low, too; say undermine-but it will not be undermining Edith.

And I don't wonder Fair Edith loved him. For, indeed, I loved him myself. And  i I shall tell uncle so, too, if he asks me.'  "You'll spoil your fortune, that I see plainly enough, if I r let you, go on so." "I'll spoil uncle's notion of hs.

Her willfulness had such  courage and candor and honesty in it--and such a witching grace, as disarmed her very gravest mentors. This was unfor- tunate, as her willfulness was impulsive rather than obstinate, and by steady, firm, and gentle discipline, might have been overcome, or, at least, modified and guided. As it was, it was *  -   SANS    SOUCI.         99 cultivated until it grew and flourished a very strong weed in the garden of her soul--often graceful and beautiful, it is true, but also noxious to the health of all the flowers of beauty and goodness implanted by God and nature there. Do not blame my poor little "Careless "--blame her mother, her pastors and masters, if you please, but not herself too much. Life lay be- fore her with its awful chastisements. And -be sure that the plant of bitterness that might have been so easily drawn up from the yielding soil of her child-bosom, but had been permit- ted to strike deep, strong roots in her heart, would be up- rooted and torn forth some time by the hand of life, though the lacerated bosom should bleed itself to death. On Saturday, at the hour specified, the carriage came to Old Field Cottage, and conveyed Mrs. L'Oiseau and her child to Luckenough. They were very kindly received by the Commo- dore, and affectionately embraced by Henrietta, who conducted them to a pleasant room, where they could lay off their bon- nets, and which they were thenceforth to consider as their own-- apartment. This was not the one which had been occupied by Edith. Edith's chamber had been left undisturbed and locked up by Mrs. Waugh, and was kept ever after sacred to her memory. The sojourn of Mrs. L'Oiseau and Jacquelina at Luckenough was an experiment on the part of the Commodore. He did not mean to commit himself hastily, as in the case of his sudden choice of Edith as his heiress. He intended to take a good, long time for what he called " mature deliberation"-often one of the greatest enemies to upright, generous, and disinterested action-to hope, faith, and charity, that I know of, by the way. Commodore Waugh also determined to have his own will in-all. things, this time at least. He had the vantage ground noyw, and was resolved to keep it. He had caught Sans Souci young, before she could possibly have formed even a childish predilection for one of the opposite sex, and he was determined to raise and educate a wife for his beloved Grim'. Grim' could  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7871-00000043"/> 100r     T THE MSSING   BRIDE. certainly wait six or seven years for the sake of a grqat estate and a young wife, and in six or seven years the child of nine would be marriageable, he thought-his wish, of course, " was father to that thought." And in the meantime he resolved to keep'such a watch over Jacquelina, that io fascinating' young officer, nor anybody else, should run away with her heart. And all these counsels he kept to himself-not trusting even Hen- rietta with them. . He sent Jacquelina to school at C--. She went every morning- on a pony; with a servant to attend her, and to remain in the village all day, and t0%bring her home at night. This continued through the summer aid fall, but -towards winter, when the roads began to be veiy bad, it was necessarily discontinued. It was a part of- Commodore Waugh's plan- not to send Sans Souci away from home, or to let her out of his own surveillance. Therefore upon the en- forced suspension of her attendance at school, he was very much embarrassed as to how he should proceed with her edu- cation. At length a bright thought struck him. Professor Grimshaw had lately returned to C--  Academy, after an absence of several months. Dr. Grimshaw would, doubtless, resume his semi-weekly visits to' Luckenough, for no bad wea- ther or bad roads had ever yet deterred him. Well! when next Grim' came to the house, Old Nick would let him some- what-into his plans, and engage him upon every visit to set lessons to Jacquelina, which she should learn in the intervals, and to take the general supervision of her education. The longer he contemplated this plan the better he liked it, and the more he improved it. Dr. Grimshaw should also be Jacque. lina's escort from church every Sunday, when he usually ac- companied the family home to dinner. And this was the way he should manage that. Jacquelina should no longer go with himself and his wife in the carriage-she should ride the pony, and as Grim' also always rode horseback, he would thus be obliged to escort the only equestrian female of the party. Oh, he knew how to manage, he chuckled to himself! he would so betimes accustom Sans Souci to Grim' that she would not be  , .s   SANS  SOUCI.          101 able to do without him, and so drill her into the idea that he was to be her future husband, that she should not be able to dream of anybody else in that relation. Meanwhile the Com- modore became very fond of his little- "Thoughtless," and she began to like her uncle's petting and caressing so much as to forget her resolution " to pay him for his behavior to Edith," and took no unusual pains to annoy him. -But, alas, without any painstaking, and by merely following out her impulses, Sans Souci annoyed the old man excessively. r And his trou- bles increased in proportion with his love for the hare-brained child. For one thing, she was:incessantly running herself into danger, ti:t' kept her self-constituted guardian in perpetual tremors. Then she was always starting forbidden subjects, or making terribly unfortunate speeches, which always shocked Henrietta, enraged the Commodore, and kept her poor mother on the qui vive.  For instance, i h errst night at Luckenough, in the morning, at breakfast, ln cle asked her, "Well, Flibbertigibbet how did you like your hammock and quarters?" -  "Hammock and quarters?' { Yes, your bed and your room, I mean?" "Oh! why,'b .at all! it was very large and gloomy-it smelt dreadfully daI d musty, and the rats and mice ran about in the walls so ifh, that I could not sleep a wink!

Now, please -don't, for indeed I wouldn't live in it for anything in-the world, and if ever you give it- to me, I shall just set fire to it and burn it down, as sure as you do!" Here was an explosion! The Commodore darted a look of rage at poor Mrs. L'Oiseau, who blushed violently, and faltered out that she had only meant to bribe Jacquelina into being a good girl-that she, for herself, desired and expected nothing of the sort, of course-heaven forbid I The Commodore wotuld not affront a lady, and his relative, at his own board.

And it was some time before he re- covered his serenity. Mrs. L'Oiseau led her child to her own room, and com- menced a tearful expostulation with her upon the subject of her habitual thoughtlessness, and the continual mischief that it caused. Sans Souci gazed at her mother in the utmost amaze- ment. "'Why, mother, what did-I say? How should it have made such trouble?" Mrs. L'Oiseau attempted to make her understand. In vain I "I only repeated your own words, Mimmy-how could they have been improper?" And upon one particular Sabbath day, Sans Souci fell into an unprecedented number of mistakes and misfortunes. The whole family at Luckenough, with the exception of herself, had remained at home, but she was sent to church for the whole day in charge of Doctor Grimshaw, ho w,:ne of the teachers of the Sunday-school. And the rt'ss fairy had felt herself dreadfully bored by the long catechism lessons of the morning, the longer service and sermon of the forenoon, and the repeti- tion of the whole matter in the afternoon. So she: arrived home in the evening thoroughly exasperated by the confine- ment and discipline of the day. She met the family circle at the supper table. Doctor Grimshaw, after ha'ing brought her home, had departed.            it "Well, Jacko I who did you see at church?" aged her uncle, pinching her ear. "Jacko" twitched herself away, impatiently exclaiming, "All the peoplel Such a dismal looking set 1 I don't want to go there again! I wont, neither I There, now!"

But the tears rushed to Mrs. L'Oiseau's eyes, and she began to expostulate, saying, "Oh, my dear, my dear little girl, don't, don't talk so rudely and violently. I know, of course, you never in the world could do anything like that, but still, don't talk of such horrid things, my dear. You must be sweet, and gentle and docile, like the dear little children of the Nuns' school that you saw in church to-day." "What were they all dressed in white for, Mimmy?" asked Jacquelina, curiously. "Why, their white dresses were emblematic of their spotless innocence." "U mtph-hum! I know now. And-were the black dresses of the nuns emblematic of the-other?" "Oh, you wicked child I No, they wear black as a badge of their retirement from the world, and their devotion to heaven." "Is black the favorite color in heaven, Mimmy?"

Sorrow the day she went away!" The master of the house, who had been laughing until this moment, now suddenly changed his countenance, laid down his knife and fork, and looking sternly at his little niece, said,    SANS  So  CIO.        lO, "That is a name I never permit to be mentioned by any one under this roof!" Sans Souci pursed up her lips, and stretched her eyes. "Indeed l" she said. "That's mighty unlucky now I because I had rather talk about Fair Edith than repeat the prettiest verses, and I'm sure I shall never remember to forget her." "You had better do so, Miss, I assure you," said the Com- modore. "Oh Jacquelina 1" exclaimed her mother, in a low, anxious voice. "Now, uncle, and now Mimmy, s'pose I was to forget to talk about Fair Edith, that wouldn't prevent other people from talking, and they do talk a plenty now, I tell you 1" The Commodore pricked up his ears-he was rather sensitive to public opinion. Jacquelina was quick to perceive it--she went on maliciously, "Yes they were talking about it in church, between the morning and the afternoon services, to-day." "Humph I Impudent, meddlesome fools!

"No, uncle, it will only cut off my inheritance," said Jacque- lina, who, child as she was, had thoroughly learned the meaning of that phrase. This shocked them all into silence for a little while, and then the Commodore spoke again. "And pray, Miss, am I to understand that you also think me a brute, to act as I did in the case of Edith?" Sans Souci stretched her eyes to the widest extent, in sincere astonishment, and after a little pause, replied, "Why, uncle, to be sure I do What could I think but the truth?" "There goes the very last hope of an inheritance," thought Mrs. L'Oiseau, as she arose from the table in great distress, and apologizing for her child's rashness as well as she could, led her away to their room, and sitting down upon the bed, began to sob.

But you must be very polite and attentive to Professor Grimshaw; you must try to please him-because he is a great favorite with your uncle." "And I'm a great favorite with him, Mimmy! And if he would only stop teaching me the seven deadly sins and the rest of it, I should like him so much!" "Who, Professor Grimshaw, my dear?" "Yes, Mimmy." "I was afraid you didn't like him?" "Oh! but I do! he is so stiff and solemn and dark and lan- tern-jawed-and so comical looking-and so like the picture of the Ogre, in tie fairy tales, that I can't help laughing every time I look at him! And he likes me; too, only he never laughs at me; he never laughs at all-now that is so funny." "It is because he has got a grave, serious sort of character. You must try to be serious, too. This is a very serious world, we live in." "Now, Mimmy, I think it is the very funniest world that ever was heard of!" "Be serious, my child this is a very serious life we lead.

So much for poor Sans Souci's lessons in English grammar and church catechism I  More than six months had passed since the arrival of Jac- quelina at Luckenough. It was now mid-winter, and the snow lay nearly two feet deep around the old mansion-house, and the naked trees of the forest stood' out stiff and stark in black tracery against the leaden back-ground of the sky. The roads were in such a condition, as to nearly preclude the possibility of traveling. No one came and went between Luckenough and the rest of the world, except Doctor Grimshaw, and some- times Cloudesley Mornington. The excitement of the Christ- mas holidays had passed, and all life was rather lifeless at Luckenough. Jacquelina was, however, a wholesome irritant, and kept the people from dying of torpor. In and out of the house almost every instant; keeping the doors banging, and the wind driving through the old passages and parlors, to the great detriment of the invalid soldier; all over the plantation, and through every negro quarter; upon the tops of sheds and barns and corn-houses; out into the forest, and up into the highest branches of the dry, bare trees, upon no other errand than that of mischief and danger; sliding upon the frozen forest 'stream, into which she often broke and fell, with no more fatal conse- quences than a douse- in the ice water, and a run home in stiff, frozen clothes; clambering upon the backs of unbroken colts, and holding on their manes for a bridle, and riding them until they threw her into the snow--getting herself once tossed by the bull, and saved only by falling into a deep drift-in short, going everywhere, and doing everything that could keep her friends on a perpetual rack of anxiety, was little Sans Souci! And the more the sprite tormented and tortured her friends, the better they seemed to love her. This was especially the case with the Commodore. Nothing could exceed his care for the child. He charged every servant on the premises with the duty of looking after her, and keeping her in sight, and out of danger, threatening each one separately with the most awful   SANS  -SOUC.         109, visitations of his wrath, if any harm came to Miss Jacquelina L'Oiseau. And a precious time the servants had of it, parti-l cularly old Jenny, who was the regularly appointed nurse or maid of the young lady.

"Where is the little wretch now?" asked the Commodore, one day when -the family were about to sit down to dinner.- "Where is she? Call Jenny!' And when Jenny was called, and came in, gray and breath' less with fear-- "Where is Miss Jacquelina?" he asked. "Done dome up de top o' de hemlock, ole Marse, .honey I 'deed is de chile.

Sans Souci appeared to listen with the utmost attention only sometimes her eyelids swayed heavily, as if they wouli close in sleep. But, upon the whole, Mrs. Waugh-had everj reason to suppose -that she was producing a very serious im pression upon the little -creature, whose eyes were towards the last fixed upon hers with great earnestness. Jacquelina was evidently full of some thought. "Aunty!" she said, when Mrs. Henrietta had finished the lecture; and was reposing upon her laurels. "Aunty!" looking solemnly in the lady's face. "What, my dear?"   - "Do you know the white kitten's eyes are open-and it aint but eight days oldl Indeed they arel  You can see them yourself if you go in the barn.

Mrs. Henrietta sighed deeply, and arose and, left the room. So the elf escaped confinement upon that occasion. But the next day she-fell into so many unpardonable disorders, that for the first time in her life, she found herself actaally imprisoned in the long threatened "dark closet," the dark closet in the disused parlor, and where Mrs. Waugh kept her choicest jellies and sweetmeats. Cloudesley Mornington, who happened to be spending the day at Luckenough, was extremely indignant at what he called "this outrage," "this tyranny." He would say little, of course, but as soon as the parlor was vacated, he went into it and sat down at the outside of Sans Souci's prison door, telling her not to grieve, that he meant to stay there until she was released, if it were all night--telling her how much he liked her, and wheat a good girl she was, and what an old brute her uncle was, and offering to tell her stories and sing her songs to while away the hours of captivity. vr   &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7871-00000049"/> "2     THE  MSSING   BRIDE. But Sans Souci was incurable-she grieved without limit. "Don't cry, Linny I Linny, don't cry, they'll hear you, you know! And Iwouldn't let them hear me if I were you. I wouldn't let'.them think I cared so much about it, not I!" It was no use I Sans Souci wept-and wailed without ceasing. At last a bright thought struck Cloudesley. He put his lips to the keyhole and whispered, "Linny I listen I Don't cry Heat the sweetmeatsl" "And so I will, Cloudy " said the little captive, and sud- denly the tears and sobs ceased, and Sans Souci. became very still, while Cloudesley sat down chuckling. Soon after he took "( Esop's Fables' from his pocket and began to read to her And she listened and ate-sometimes stopping to say, "This citron is very nice-I wish I could put some out to you, Cloudy ;" or " this ginger is jamb I I wish you had some!" To which he would answer, "Never mind--I had a great deal rather you ate it." So he continued to read and comment on what he read, and to joke, and she listened and laughed, and, ate preserves until the afternoon had; passed. And then her talk grew shorter and shorter, until she ceased saying anything of her own ac- cord. And then her replies to him grew indistinct and wide of the subject. And, lastly, from her utter silence, he knew that the child had fallen asleep. Still he sat and kept guard, that she might not waken and find herself alone. When it grew dark, and he heard some one coming, he slipped out at one door as Mrs. Waugh entered by the other.  The lady brought a candle and a key, and opened the closet door to re- lease her prisoner. And there she found Sans Souci sound asleep among, the rifled sweetmeat jars I   CH[A PTER   i.

IN February, the deepest snow storm fell that had fallen during the whole winter. The roads were considered quite im- passable by carriages, and the family at Luckenough were blocked up in their old house. Yet one day, in the midst of this "tremendous state of affairs," as the Commodore called it, a messenger from Benedict arrived at Luckenough, the bearer of a letter to Mrs. Waugh, which he refused to entrust to any other hands but that lady's own. He was, therefore, shown into the presence of :the mistress, to whom he presented the note. Mrs. Waugh took it and looked at it with some cuiih osity-it was superscribed in a slight feminine hand-quite new to Henrietta; and she opened it, and turned immediately to the signature--MARIAN MAYFIELD-a strange name to-her; she had never seen or heard it before. She lost no more-time in perusing the letter, but as she read, her cheek flushed and paled -her agitation became excessive, she was obliged to ring for a glass of water, and as soon as she had swallowed it, she crushed and thrust the letter into. her bosom, ordered her mule to be saddled instantly, and her riding pelisse and hood to be brought. And in fifteen minutes, without a word of explana, tion to any one, she was seated on her beast, and attended by the messenger, mounted upon another mule--th only kind of animal that could stand these dreadful roads--set" forward to. wards B   .

In the meantime, Henrietta put her mule to its utmost speed, and in two hours and a half reached the village, and alighted at the little hotel. Of the landlord, who came forth respectfully to meet her, she demanded to be shown immedi- ately to the presence of the young lady who had recently ar- rived from abroad. The host bowed, and inviting the lady to 'follow him, led the way to the little private parlor, the door of which he opened to let the visitor pass in, and then bowing again, he closed it and retired.. And Mrs. Waugh found herself in a small, half-darkened room, where, reclining in an e'asy chair, sat--Edith? Was it Edith?  Could it be Edith? That fair phantom of a girl to whom the black ringlets and black dress alone seemed to give outline and personality? Yes I it was Edithl But oh! so ; changed I! so wan and transparent, with such blue shadows in the hollows of her eyes and temples and cheeks-with such heavy, heavy eyelids, seemingly dragged down by the weight of their long, sleeping lashes-with such anguish in the gaze of the melting dark eyes I "Edith, my lovel My dearest Edith!" said Mrs. Waugh, going to her.  She half arose, and sunk speechless into the kind arms opened to receive her. Mrs. Waugh held her to her bosom a moment  in silence, and then said, "Edith, my dear, I got a note from your friend, Miss Mayfield, saying that you had returned, and wished to see me. But how is this, my child? You have evidently been very ill-you are, still. Where is your husband, Edith? Edith, where is your husband?" A shiver that shook her whole frame-:a choking, gasping sob, was all the answer she could make. "Where is he, Edith? -Ordered away somewhere, upon some distant service? That is hard, but never mind I ' Hope for the best I You will meet him again, dear? But where is he, then?" She lifted up her poor head, and uttering-"DeadI dead 1" dropped it heavily again upon the kind, supporting bosom.   THE  BLIGHTED     HEART,     115 "You do not mean it My dear, you do not mean it i You do not know what you are saying I Dead I when? how?" asked Mrs. Waugh, in great trouble. "Shot I shot!" whispered the poor thing, in a tone so hollow, it seemed reverberating through a vault. And then her stricken head sunk heavily down-and Henrietta, perceived that strength and consciousness had utterly departed. She placed her in the easy-chair, and turned around to look for restoratives, when a door leading into an adjoining bed-room opened, and a young girl entered, and came quietly and quickly forward to the side of the sufferer. She greeted Mrs. Waugh politely, andi then gave her undivided attention to Edith, whose care she seemed fully competent to undertake. This young girl was not over fourteen years of age, yet the most beautiful and blooming creature, Mrs. Waugh thought, that she had ever beheld. A perfect Hebe I A richly develop- ing form, softly flushed over with the roseate hue of pure blood, that deepened and brightened to a fine carnation bloom on her cheeks and lips--a rich growth of golden-bronzed hair that rippled in a thousand glittering wavelets over the superb head, and turned into a ringlet wherever a tress escaped the comb that confined the burnished mass into a knot behind--a pair of fine, dark, clear blue eyes, full of sweetness and candor-a luxuriant exuberance of vitality glowing over the whole form and face- glowing without heat, glowing with a dewy coolness, like a blooming damask rose in the morning-an expression of kind- ness; cheerfulness, confidence and strength pervading her whole appearance-such was Marian Mayfield I Her presence in the room seemed at once to dispel the gloom and shadow. She took Edith's hand, and settled her more"at ease in- the chair-but refused the cologne and the sal-ammoniac that Mrs. Waugh produced, saying, cheerfully,         .; "She has not fainted, you perceive-she breathes-it is better to leave her to nature for a while-too, muph attention worries her-she is very weak."  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7871-00000051"/> "6     THE  Mss'NG   BRBIDE. Marian had now settled her comfortably back in the resting- chair, and stood by her side, not near enough to in the least in- /  commode her. "I do not understand all this. She says that her husband is dead, poor child-how came it about? Tell me l" said Mrs. Waugh, in a low voice. - "Marian's clear blue eyes filled with tears, but she dropped their white lids and long black lashes over them, and would not letthem fall; and her ripe lips quivered, -but she firmly compressed them, and remained silent for a moment. Then she said, in a whisper, "I will tell you by-and-by," and she glanced at Edith, to intimate that the story must not be rehearsed in her presence, however insensible she might appear to be. "You are the young lady who wrote to me?" "Yes, madam." "You are a friend of my poor girl's?" "Something more than that, madam-I will tell you by-and- by," said, Marian, and her kind, dear eyes were again turned upon Edith, and observing the latter slightly move, she said, in her pleasant,voice, "Edith, dear, shall I put you to bed-are you able to walk?"' "Yes, yes, murmured the sufferer, turning her head uneasily from side to side. Marian gave her hand, and assisted the poor-girl to rise, and tenderly supported her as she walked to the bed-room. Mrs. Waugh arose to give her assistance, but Marian shook her head at her, with a  kindly look, that seemed to say, "Do not startle her-she is used only to me lately," and bore her out of sight into the bed-room. Presently she reappeared in. the little parlor, opened the blinds, drew back the curtains, and let the sunlight into the dark room. Then she ordered more wood to the fire,.and when it was replenished, and the servant had left the room, she in- vited Mrs. W augh to draw her chair to the hearth, and ,then said, "I am ready now, madam, to tell you anything you wish to   T HE B L I G'H T E D HtE A R T.     " know-indeed I had supposed that you were acquainted wit everything relating to Edith's marriage, and its fatal results."' "I know absolutely nothing but what I have learned to-day We never received a single letter, or message, or news of an kind, or in any shape, from Edith or her husband, from the dal they left us until now.'           - Marian's bosom heaved, her lips quivered, and a large tea trembled a moment on her dark lashes, and then rolled slowl: down her damask cheek-a dew-drop on a rose. She calml: wiped it away, and then drawing a deep breath, said, "You did not hear, then, that he was court-martialed, and- sentenced to death?" "No, no-good Heaven, no!" "He was tried for mutiny or rebellion-I know not which-- but it was for raising arms against his'.superior officers while here in America-the occasion was-but you- know the occa- sion better than I do." "Yes, yes, it was when he rescued Edith from the violence of Thorg and his men. But oh I Heaven, how horrible I that he should have been condemned to death for a noble act I It is incredible-impossible-how could it have happened? He never expected such a fate-none of us did, pr we- would never have consented to his return. There seemed no prospect of such a thing. How could it have been?" "There was treachery, and perhaps perjury, too. He had an insidious and unscrupulous enemy, who assumed the guise of repentance, and candor, and friendship, the better to lure .him into his t6ils-it was the infamous Colonel Thorg, who re- ceived the command of the regiment, in reward far his: great ser- vices in America. And Michael's only powerful friend, who could and would have saved him--was dead. General Ross, yotuare aware, was killed in the battle of Baltimore."

There was a great deal of per. sonal prejudice, distortion of facts, and even perjury-in short, he was condemned and sentenced one day, and led out and shot the next!"  There was silence between them then. Henrietta sat in pale and speechless horror. And Marian's bosom was heaving vehemently, and she was pressing her hands first upon her face and then upon her breast, as-if to command down the strong emotion. "But how long is it since my poor Edith has been so awfully widowed?" at length inquired Mrs. Waugh. "Nearly f6ur months," replied Marian, in a tremulous voice. "For six weeks succeeding his death, she was not able to rise from her bed. I came from school to nurse her. I found her completely prostrate under the blow. I wonder she had not died. What power of living on some delicate frames seem to have.' As soon as she was able to sit up, I began to think that it would be, better to remove her from the strange country, the theatre of her dreadful sufferings, and to bring her to her own native land, among her own friends and relatives, where she might resume the life and habits of her girlhood, and where, with nothing to remind her of her loss, she might gradually come to look upon the few wretched months of her marriage, passed in England, as a dark dream. Therefore I have brought her back."  Mrs. Waugh looked and listened with the deepest interest, mingled with astonishment, at the young girl-so childlike, yet so womanly-so youthful, yet so wise and prudent. "And you, my dear child," said she "you were Michael Shields' sister?" "No, madam, no kin to him-and yet more than kin-for he loved me, and I loved him more than any one else in the world, as I now love his poor young widow. This was the way of it, Mrs. Waugh: Michael's father and my mother had both been married before, and we were the children of the first marriages; i 49   THE  BLIGHTED     HEART.     119 when Michael was fourteen years old, and I was seven, our pa. rents were united, and we two grew up together. About two years ago, Michael's father died. My mother survived him only five months, and'departed, leaving me in the charge of her step-son. 'We had no friends but each other. Our parents, Since their union, had been isolated beings, for this reason-his father was a Jew-my mother a Christian-therefore the friends and relatives on either side were everlastingly offended by their marriage. Therefore we had no one but each other. The little property that was left was sold, and the proceeds enabled Michael to purchase a commission in the regiment about to sail for America, and also to place ue at a good boarding school, where I remained until his return, and the catastrophe that followed it." She was silent sometime after this, her bosom heaving with ill suppressed emotion. t At last she resumed, "Lady, all passed so suddenly, that I knew no word of his return, much less of his trial or execution, until I received a visit from the chaplain who had attended his last moments, and "who brought me his farewell letter, and his last informal will, in whichthe poor fellow consigned me to the care of his wife, soon to be a widow, and enjoined me to leave school and seek her at once, and enclosed a check for the little balance he had in bank. I went immediately, found her insensible through grief, as I said-and, lady, I told you the rest." Henrietta was weeping softly behind the handkerchief she held at her eyes. At last she repeated, "You say he left you in his widow's charge?" "Yes, madam." "Left his widow in your's, rather, you good and faithful sister."  "It was the same thing, lady; we were to live together, ant to support each other."  "But what, was your thought, my dear girl, in bringing hel here?" "I told you, lady, that in her own native land, among he:                 gh,)  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7871-00000053"/> 120     THE  MSSI Na   B I DE. own dear kinsfolk, she might be comforted, and might resume her girlhood's thoughts and habits, and learn to forget- the strange dark passages- of her short married life, passed in a foreign country." "But, my dear girl, did you not know, had you never heard that her uncle disowned her for marrying against his- will?" "Something of that I certainly heard from Edith, lady, when I first proposed to her to come home. But she was very weak, and her thoughts very rambling, poor thing--she could not stick to a point long, and I overruled and guided her--I could not believe but that her friends would take her poor widowed heart to their homes again. But if it should be otherwise, still -- "Well?- still?" "Why, I cannot regret having brought her to her native soil--for, if we find no friends in America, we have left none in England--a place besides full of the most harrowing recollec- tions, from which this place is happily free. America also offers a wider field for labor than England does, and if her friends behave badly, why I will work for her, and-for her child, if it should live." "Dear Marian, you must not think by what I said just now, that I am not a friend to Edith. I am indeed. I love her almost as ift she were my own daughter. I incurred my hus- band's anger- by remaining with her after her marriage until she, sailed. I will not fail her now, be sure. Personally, I will do my utmost for her. I will also try to influence her uncle in her favor. And now, my dear, it is getting very late. and there is a long ride, and a dreadful road before me. The Commodore is already anxious for me, -I know, and if I keep him waiting much longer, he will be in no mood to be per- suaded by me. So I must go. To-morrow, my dear, a better home shall be found for you and Edith. That I promise upon my own responsibility. And now, my dear, excellent girl good-bye. I will see you again in the morning."

Henrietta thought she had never seen her husband look hideous and revolting before--the round shoulders looked more humped-the bull head and neck more bullish-the wiry gray hair and beard more grizzly, and the flaming scar across his face more fiery than ever. She felt rather indignant, slo as she was to be moved to anger; but for Edith's sake she governed her feelings, and replied, "Poor child--she did not come back to seek aid from an: one. She lies like a dying Child, without the power to form a thought or wish for herself, and she knows nothing whateve of my application to you."           , "Then you'd better wait till she authorizes you to beg fc her, Mrs. Waugh."         -  -  X    t "I would," said Henrietta, suppressing her anger, but i she is lying there, perfectly incapable of thought or action, an in the greatest extremity, some one must thin and act f her." i    ", Let-her husband's fine English relations do it, then." ,'t '  "He had but one relative, a young girl; she has come over attend upon Edith, as I told you before."     -  "With the hope of bettering herself, I suppose!

She urged upon him the claims of humanity, of relation- ship, of Christian charity, of the world's opinion-vain, and worse than vain ! And as for the fumes Qf tobacco, while they soothed him into quietness, they also seemed to sink him into sullenness and doggedness. And at last, Henrietta arose and left the room with a feeling of repulsion, that all Old Nick's ugli- ness had never been able to awaken before. The destitute return of Edith was now pretty generally known through the household, thanks to the Commodore's loud replies, and brutal and violent manner. The 'members of the family were gathered into little knots, discussing the affair. Henrietta was very much troubled and perplexed. She had given her word that a home should be provided for Edith and Marian that very day-she had also promised to see them that morning. Now the morning was half over, and. she had nothing hopeful to carry them. It was little Jacquelina who helped her out of the dilemma. She chanced to find the fairy in her mother's room, standing between old Jenny's knees, getting her hair combed and curled. "Auity    Has Fair Edith come back ?" "Yes, my dear." "And wont uncle invite her to come here and stay ?" "No, Lapwing." "And she hasn't got any place to go ?" "No, she is houseless, poor thing" ' Well, I1I tell you what, Aunty, let her go and live at Old   I   THE BLIGHTED HEART.   123   Field Cottage-that's a nice place I A great deal nicer than this great big, horrid, old Lock-em-up, as Crazy Nell calls it. I'm sure I wish Mimmy would go back to it herself-we can see the outside of the world there, and the ships go up and down the bay. Fair Edith can go there." "Why, I do not know but that's a good idea, Lapwing. I'll speak to your mother about it." When, a few minutes after, Mrs. L'Oiseau entered the chamber, Mrs. Waugh broke the subject to her. "Why," said Mary, "the cottage stands just as we left it. The furniture is mine, and Edith is quite welcome to the use of it, if her uncle will consent to let her reside there." "Indeed I shall not ask him any questions about it," said Mrs. Waugh, "and since you are kind enough to let Edith have the use ofihe furniture, I shall load a cart with provisions and send it on in advance, and I shall then go to Benedict and convey Edith and her friend thither. And, Jenny, you may just pack up your clothes and go with me. You must remain with Edith, to wait upon her for some months to come yet-in the meantime, we will find some younger maid for Lapwing, and after that we will see what's to be done."  And Henrietta went out to hasten her preparations. Mary L'Oiseau was very much disturbed in consequence of this independent proceeding on the part of Mrs. Waugh, and expressed her dread lest she herself should draw the anger of the irascible Commodore down upon her head, for the share she had in it by lending her furniture. But Jacquelina was indig- nant that any one should be afraid to befriend Fair Edith. And Old Jenny expressed her perfect confidence that her mistress knew what she was doing, and that if she couldn't "'trol old marse in all things, she could 'trol him in most."  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7871-00000055"/> CRHAPTER IX.

AFTER despatching a wagon, well loaded with all necessary provisions, and many comforts and luxuries, for Old Field Cot- tage, Mrs. Waugh mounted her mule, and attende[y Jenny -on another, trotted off towards B . Good Henrietta was never thoroughly provoked before this. These usually calm, benignant souls, when they are moved, are very deeply troubled, indeed. She rode on, in something very like sullenness, feeling a strange, new repulsion toward her old invalid soldier, and a dislike, bordering upon contempt, for Mary L'Oiseau, and her small selfishness and cowardice. Old Jenny, excessively social and loquacious, like all her race, made several attempts to open a conversation, persevering until her mistress, speaking for the first time, said, "Don't bother me, Jenny." And at this really unprecedented rebuff, the old maid sunk into a mortified silence, that continued the remainder of the ride through the forest. When they reached the village and the little hotel and were shown into the small, shady parlor, Mrs. Waugh found Edith and Marian both present, and enjoying more comfort and privacy than might have been expected.

But one of the things my mother- succeeded in im- pressing upon my mind was, the value of time as capital-the only capital of the poor-the only inheritance which all have re- ceived alike from the Heavenly Father. Now I have a plenty of time, and no lack of work; and whatever my hand' findeth to do,' I 'do it with my might 1 " said Marian, smiling-and nodding. There X  a frank, confident, cheerful strength in everything the you  irl said, or did, or looked, that had the most en- couraging and inspiring effect upon any one who saw or lhard her. The little fog was charmed away from Henrietta's temper by the sunniness of Marian's presence. "And Edith, my dear--?"  "She had a quiet night-took some little breakfast this morn- ing, and has been lying very still-as you see her-all day." Henrietta walked softly towards the sofa, and Edith drew the handkerchief from her face, and held out her poor, thin, trans- parent hand. Mrs. Waugh took it, and caressed it a little, and bent over and softly kissed the sufferer, and sat down by her. But Edith turned her head to the wall, and again covered her face with her handkerchief.' Mrs. Waugh then explained to Marian the arrangements that had been made for their accommodation at Old Field Cottage, apologizing, at the same time, for the small size and solitary situation of the house, and bitterly regretting that she had not in herself the power to offer a home at Luckenough. "But now. do you know that I think what has been provided is just the best possible provision in the world for Edith .7 Think of it I  Under present circumstances, it would drive her 8  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7871-00000056"/> 126     THE., MSSING    BRIDE.           i crazy to live at Luckenough. The cottage is just what she needs-it offers her the solitude, the silence, and, the perfect -rest she craves. As to its poverty of accommodations, that too falls in with her mood. Edith, like many other mourners in their first bereavement, is possessed of a certain asceticism, and will enjoy no luxury, or even comfort, if she can help it, be. cause the loved and the lost are not to share it with her. And  I really do not think nature ever errs in these things-and I -  think if they are not opposed, they help to soothe the sharp  pains of sorrow, and afterwards they gradually wear out.."  "Where did you get your wisdom, my dear girl? and you so 4. young--too young to have known much4 trouble, or to have   / had much experience.^" ;. . '"I have seen a great deal of other people's sorrgo, and my I little experience has been of a sort to make me ob and re-  fleet. But let us talk of Edith-you need not be afraid that she shall suffer for any comfort upon account of the distance of ( the cottage from the village.: I am a good walker, and can go ten or fifteen miles without much fatigue."  "And do you think that I shall allow anything of that sort? : a No, my dear-I shall send over the pony that used to be    A Edith's, and my own mule also, and oats and corn for both.  i Consider, my dear girl, that I have the right to provide for all Ja the wants of your little household. What a well ordered little home it will be with you at the head of it, I am sure l--and I  will do my best to anticipate all your wants, but if I happen to ? forget any, call upon me with the utmost freedom and frankness, ? as, upon one who considers herself very deeply obliged to you for all your kindness and attention to her own niece."   ;I Mrs. Waugh then arose to take leave, and they went to the parlor. Henrietta went to the sofa, and stooped and kissed Edith, merely whispering, in a low voice, "Good-by, dear child; I will see you again in the morning." i - Edith took her hand and pressed it in silence. And so they parted. Mrs. Waugh went home.                    *        '    +,. . . 1    MARIAN.            12t The next morning at sunrise the family carriage stood at the door, and Henrietta had it well packed with everything that she could think of to add to the stores sent-on the day before. And leaving word for the family to sit down to breakfast with- out her, she entered the carriage, again accompanied by Jenny; and drove to B  .               - She got there in time to eat breakfast with Marian- She then insisted upon settling the whole bill at the hotel, and had all the baggage belonging to her two proteges packed into a cart, to follow in the wake of the carriage. Then, assisted by Marian, she dressed Edith, and placed her on the back seat of the carriage, and herself and Marian occupied the front seat. Jenny rode in the baggage cart. And they set forward towards Old Field Cottage. Their way lay.::oi desert meadows, through remnants of the forest, over the old sterile fields, for seven miles to the sea-side cottage. it lwas ten o'clock when theysreached it--the snow lay drifted all around the deserted cot--no road was near it,;except that made 'by the provision wagon that had come the day be- fore. Edith was lifted out, and borne over the snow into the house. And the rest of her party followed. The room was just as we have seen it in the time of Mrs. ;'Oiseau's residence there-, witlr its low ceiling, its white-washed walls, sanded floor, pine table, flag-bottomed chairs, plain shelves, and corner cupboard, filled with blue delf ware; there was no lounge -nor easy chair to receive the languid frame of the invalid. She had to be carried up stairs in the arms of Oliver, and laid upon her bed. When she had fallen into a sleep of exhaustion, Mrs. Waugh and Marian left her, and came down stairs and had a talk. "Now, is there anything that -you can think of that I can send her, my dear?" asked Henrietta. "Yes, Mrs. Waugh, if you will be so good. You know that she cannot stay up in that loft every day, and all day long, as : well as all night, and neither can she sit up down here--" "I see-she needs a couch and a lounging chair for this room,  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7871-00000057"/> 128     THE  MSSING   BRIDE. and she shall have them. I will send them over to-morrow. If there anything else?' - "No, madam." The floor was crowded with the unladen contents of the two baggage wagons. And Marian was already busy among ham- pers, baskets, bundles, bags, casks, kegs, etc., arranging them in the cupboard or under the shelves. Mrs. Waugh looked as if she wished to assist, but she was all unaccustomed to the use of her hands, and she could only call Oliver from watering the horses, and Jenny from gather- ing wood for the fire, to come in and assist in clearing the room andpacking away the provisions. When all this was done, and the fire was blazing cheerfully, and the kettle singing over it, and the little round table set out with some of the dainties she had furnished, HeiAietta only waited to partake with Marian of the first meal eaten in the little home-" a tea dinner --and then took leave, promising to visit her at least three times a week. Henrietta reached Luckenough about sunset, little thinking of the furious storm that was to meet her there. As she drove up to the house and alighted from the carriage, one of her favorite housemaids came out with a frightened countenance, and drawing her aside, whispered, "Please, mist'ess, go up to your room, and 'tend like you're got a berry bad head-ache." "And why should I do that, you blockhead?" "Deed mistress, honey, ole marse done got de debbil in him,  an' I wouldn' wonder what he'd do! 'Deed mist'ess, don't you go in dar, honey, please. You take 'vice. 'Deed he is got de debbil in him, honey-.-deed he --chuck up to his berry t'roat 1" "So much the more reason for my going to him. He has bottled up Satan against my return. , He will let him off, and get rid of him as soon as I appear," thought Mrs. Waugh, as she passed into the house, and sought at once the presence of the angry man. She found him stamping up and down the 4.,= s     :       I    .          toT-.Ng.'   MARI AN.           129 hall-alone-he ha4 frightened every living creature from his proximity. Mary L'Oiseau was cowering in her distant cham- ber, Jacquelina off into the forest, the servants all huddling to- gether in-the kitchen-the very dogs had sneaked off and were trembling in their kennels. And the Commodore strode up and down the hall, in the solitary majesty of his own demoni- acal passion. In his best moods he was unfortunately very ugly, but now, in his diabolical anger, he was hideous--his, huge form, and humped shoulders, and big head, and grizzly hair and beard, and fiery visage, adorned with that flaming scar-all, as it were, lighted up and glowing with fiendish rage! As soon as Henrietta appeared, the storm burst upon her de- voted head. I am not about to describe this scene-it is unfit for repeti tion here. It is sufficient to say that the Commodore had learned all that his wife had been doing for Edith-and now he poured out his wrath without measure; all that a coarse and unscrupulous- old man, roused to fury, would say and do, was said and done--infamous charges, degrading epithets, and brutal and violent threats were hurled at, were showered upon good Henrietta. He called her an artful, designing woman, a deceiver, a household traitress-nay, he did not scruple many times to call her a thief-accusing her of purloining and ap- propriating property to which she had no right. And since he could not prosecute her, as he would any other malefactor, he should use his own authority, and punish the felony as it de- served. And so he strode and swore and gesticulated-stop- ping once in a while to shake his fists in Henrietta's face. It took about three hours for him to blow and storm himself down into a state of exhaustion. And there sat Henrietta just as quiet as'if she had been a wax figure, labeled, "a fat, comfortable, middle-aged woman reposing." So she had sat many times before, waiting for the tempest to subside-only this timer had he-but. noticed the set- of her mouth  As it was, her very immobility at last added fuel to the fire  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7871-00000058"/> 130   .

What can you say?   Why don't you speak?" "Because that which I have to say, should be heard by a man in his sober senses--which you ate not," said Henrietta. "Oh-h-h  Tah-h-h I Pish-ish-sh I Tush-ush-sh!" and every other expression that would throw contempt and scorn upon her words, and-"What is it then?" "Anon-presently, Commodore I What I have to say, shall be said some half hour hence, when you have blown off the last of your anger. Will you please to begin again, and not stop till you get through?"      - He did begin again I And his first fury, violent as it was, was a mere jest to this one-he became actually insane, mad- dened, frenzied. More than once Henrietta felt herself in im- minent personal danger.... It was terrific--but it was the sooner over. In less than half an hour his strength was thoroughly exhausted, and he let himself drop into his elbow-chair as :feeble, as helpless, as much in need of a restorative as a fainting girl. ' Henrietta contemplated him, as he sat there gasping and blowing, and blunderingly wiping his inflamed and streaming face. At last she spoke- : "What I had to say to you,r Commodore, is this--listen, for believe me, it nearly concerns our future life." i Go on, ma'am." "You know well enough that I am not subject to tempers, not apt to'speak from excitement, and not a woman of vain words.           -    "Too: much preface, ma'am-too much preface by half." "Very well; to proceed--I need not remind you what my regard for you has hitherto been.. You- know that I was be- trothed to you at the age of fifteen-that you went away, and 'for twenty years was lost to your family--during the whole of *    r   MA RAN.    -        tS that time, even when believing you to be dead, I remained faithful to your memory. At the end of that time-at the ag of thirty-five, I found myself an old maid-but still an inde pendent and happy old maid, with my fortune and time at m: own disposal. Then you suddenly reappeared-unrecogniza ble, a weather-beaten, battle-scarred, disabled old man. Ani when you asked me to redeem the pledge I had made yoi twenty years before, I left my free and happy life, to becom your nurse and housekeeper. You know how light and pleasan your amiable temper rendered my tasks. Enoughl What ' have been to you for the last fifteen years, it better become Lyou to remember than me to recapitulate." "You are turning off fine phrases, I think, madam 1" "I can turn off coarser ones, better adapted to your coam prehension, Commodore Waugh." "Damme, madam, what do you mean?"  . "Only this," said Henrietta, "I mean that the scene of thi afternoon, shall never be repeated with impunity--I mean if i should be repeated, to leave you at once and for ever!' And ' am not one to make vain threats." :Iad the roof of the house fallen, had the sky dropped, ha( the surface of the earth collapsed--had any of these impossibl! things happened, theCommodore would not have been mor completely astounded, more utterly overwhelmed! tIenriett leave him; he do without Henrietta?

He looked really-pitia ble. Henrietta proceeded without mercy.

Now, however, to use a phrase not too -'fine' for your comprehension, you have got to the length of your cable with me; you can go no further at all, without cutting loose, breaking with me. Wh4at I have done for Edith, has been done at my own proper expense. I should scorn to remind you, were it not-necessary, that Old Field Cot- tage was a part of my own dower-that Jenny, whomnx have sent thither, was my own woman, and that the provisions I have sent, were purchased with my own funds. I have seldom ap- plied to you, Commodore Waugh, for money to carry on the household expenses. It seems very mean and miserable that I should have to say these things to you, but it is absolutely needful to do so. And; moreover, I assure you, Commodore, that whether you -like it or not, I am fully determined to pro- vide for Edith and her little household; and remember, she is your niece, not mine. I intend to send her over the sofa and the easy-chair from my bedroom; and also my mule and the ponsythat she used to ride, and a cart-load of provender for them. And I shall also settle a pension on her. This I feel to be incumbent upon me, and shall do it at my own-cost, and ' whether you like it or not. But, Commodore Waugh, I repeat it, if you do impede me in the performance of my duties, if you do harass, and wrong, and abuse me about them; I will, so heaven help me I separate myself froml you at once and forever."' ' You-you-you are heated I You-you are angry. You speak from excitement, Henrietta," stuttered the confounded and discomfited old soldier. "No-I never get excited. I am cooled by what- has passed --not heated. I am not moved to anger, Comimodore, but to action. '.You know it. - And you know I will keap my word. For I am not one to use vain threats, or having forrged a reso- lution to repent of it, or having taken a step to retrace it. And so, Commodore Waugh, I leave you to think upon what S-have said." And Henrietta arose and gathered her shawl airound her shoulders, and went to her chamber to take off her bonnet and prepare for 6ea. *   ^'               .   "  ,**i   MARIAN. O           133 He sat there, immovable-his nerves and brain almost in a state of disorganization. "Think" of what she had said I He didn't know how to think-he had never thought in his life. Henrietta had always been his thinker--he had considered it a part of her duty. She had always thought for him, as she had nursed him, kept house for him, managed his farm, and ba, lanced his accounts. And now, suddenly to call upon him to "think"--the most difficult of all the rest. He couldn't think, that was all about it his brains were in a state of semi- decomposition, and had long ceased to perform any other function than that of a very dull galvanic battery, to propel the turgid blood in its downward ebb. So he sat there as helpless as an old lion without claws- or teeth, feeling himself to be not a dangerous-brute, though he could roar so terribly. Henrietta's matrimonial admonition had been administered with all due privacy and discretion. Yet what is there that transpires in a house full of servants, especially of old family servants, who have an interest beyond mere curiosity in know- ing everything that happens, that is not discovered and dis- cussed? It was therefore well ascertained that the Commodore had been put down, that the household "Thunderer" had been silenced, and that his throne was a stool of repentance I And so the Commodore shared the bitter fate of "Darius great and good," and other fallen potentates, and was not only deserted but derided " at his utmost needy"Mrs. L'Oiseau kept a dis- creet distance, knowing not how to steer her course to avoid the Scylla and Charybdis of the opposed parties.- For though Henrietta was decidedly Lady Paramount, yet the Commodore alone possessed the power of bequeathing Luckenough. -The very servants no longer flew to do his bidding-perhaps, be- cause the dispirited old man had ceased to use the moving arguments of Candle-sticks and pokers hurled at their heads. The Commodore was a dethroned despot, and so everybody took sides against him; .-- .. Everybody but Jacquelina. It was impossible fo. calculate what would be that elf's course of action in any given-case- "*  , \  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7871-00000060"/> 134     THE   MSSING  BRIDE. -no conclusion could ever be drawn from her precedents or from a knowledge of her character-it was sure to deceive. One thing alone .you could reckon upon-if you should expect her to pursue one course, you might be sure she would pursue the iother. Upon this occasion any one in the world who knew Jacquelina and her little eccehtric antecedents, might have rea. sonably supposed that she would have strongly opposed herself to her uncle. Not she. Now he was the weaker party, and a certain chivalric generosity always led Sans Souci to range herself upon the weaker side-very often that was the only test of right and wrong, and reversing the code of the world, Sans Souci was too apt to consider the weak and defeated always right, and the strong and victorious always wrong. So Jac- queliua adhered to the Commodore in his mortification. She hovered about him, ran his errands, picked over his tobacco, filled and lighted his pipes, combed his hair and beard, and did everything she could think of to mitigate his case. And when nothing could move his melancholy, she would break out in something like the following strains of flattery and consolation: "Never you mind, Uncle Nick I Spose you were naughty- you've got the same right to be naughty that other people have, I reckon, and so don't you feel cut up about it 1l "But I've not been naughty, Jacquelina," would the Com- modore answer, almost meekly, "I only wanted justice--what was in the bond, you know l" "Never mind, Nunky-never mind whether you have or :not I You've got as much right to tell fibs about it as the murderers have to plead 'not guilty.' , Oh I such a deep groan would be the comment upon this I "Don't you take on so, now, Nunky. Don't groan--swear I Raise a row, and make a tremendous noisel Fire off your blunderbuss as fast as ever you can-load it! And blow the whole house sky high!" ' "Um--yes-I knowl Ishould like to do that--but then Henrietta would leave me, Jacko--she would, as sure as i shooting?"   M A R I AN.          135 "Oo-oo-oo!" cooed Sans Souci, pursing up her lips and raising her eyebrows, " is that it? Now I know!" Soon after this, Jacquelina took- it upon herself to arraign Henrietta. "Now, aunty, just you tell me what you've been doing to uncle to make him mope about so, like a poor old -turkey gob- bler with the distemper?" "Does he:?" said Henrietta, absently. "I Does he?' Why anybody can see he does I He's lost all his pleasant old ways-he never stamps up and down the :hall roaring and bellowing and scaring the old beams and rafters into shaking agues-and he never throws the cats out of the window, nor kicks the dogs, nor flings his boot-jack at Bill's head, nor does anything he used to do I He's lost all his live- liness. He'll pine away and die, I know he will. Now what have you done to him?" "Nothing improper, Lapwing." "I don't know what you call improper, I am sure, aunty. I think it was shocking to treat him so. And he the head of the family l" "Yes, but, my dear, suppose the 'Head' were so heated and inflamed as to be almost crazy, and in danger of getting quite frantic and doing the other members some fatal injury, wouldn't you clap a lump of ice to the ' Head' to cool it down and make it sensible? And now, my little Lapwing, if you can under- stand what I have said, so much the better, but whether you can or not, go now and wait upon your uncle, attend him as devotedly as you please, the better you serve, him the more I shall be satisfied with you, only, my dear, don't presume to lec- ture your aunty, that is quite beyond your province, my little Lapwing." "Well, that is right- downdacious?'" exclaimed Jacquelina; "aunty not only mutinies against the Commodore, but rebels against me 17 And from that time Sans Souci made common cause with her uncle, and became the strongest and most una compromising of allies.  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7871-00000061"/> 1;Jtj     THE   MSSING   BRIDE. Nevertheless, Henrietta's star was in the ascendant and reigned supreme. And to do the good creature justice, she did not abuse her power.  She was more attentive than ever to the invalid soldier, and more careful than ever of his inte- rests, but she did send over the sofa and easy-chair, and the mule and pony, etc., to Edith, and she did also settle an annuity upon her--being the half of her own income from her bank stock. As for the Commodore, when he recovered from his first panic of astonishment, the new necessity of moderating and controlling his furious passions proved very beneficial, not only to his moral but to his physical health; and he began to miss those sudden and violent attacks of illness that had so often brought him to the brink of the grave, and that had always been traced back to those frantic outhreaks of temper as their cause. Not that the old soldier was wholly reformed in that respect. By no means-a sudden and total suppression of his passions might have killed him'; but he was so modified and improved that life at Luckenough grew much brighter and more comfortable. CHAPTER X. HOUSEKEEPING AT OLD FIELD COTTAGE "She hath no scorn of common things, And though she seems of other birth, Yet patiently she folds her wings To tread the humble paths of earth. She doeth little kindnesses, Which most leave undone or despise, For naught that sets one heart at ease; Is low esteemed in her eyes."-Lowel. IT was a very interestihg little family that settled down at the bay-side cottage--the tiny family of three in all. There was Edith, with her low illness and her still sorrow--   HOUSEKEEPING AT OLD FIELD COTTAGE. 137 her sorrow that had passed through all its violent, passionate, and frenzied stages, and had settled into this deep, calm de- spair, out of which, if you will be patient with her, it will also pass, for Providence is a wise, beneficent father, and Nature is a tender nursing mother, and they will bring her through. For the present blame her not that she lay upon her lounge al- ways as still as death, with her slender white hands clasped above her head, and her handkerchief thrown over her eyes, as if to shut out the sight of all earthly objects-that she lay there with her fair face growing paler, and its blue shadows deeper, day by day. There was Marian, beautiful and blooming Marian, with her young wisdom, her cheerful temper, and her ready sympathies -with her swift, light step, her busy, nimble fingers, and her prompt, despatchful industry. She cheerfully and confidently assumed the whole care and responsibility of the small house- hold, and diligently occupied herself with its interests, and with manifold, affectionate preparations for the welcome of the little pilgrim, who, she trusted, would shortly bring hope and love back to the young widowed mother's heart, and sunshine and gladness to her humble home. Lastly, there was Jenny, with'her indefatigable hands, and, alas I her indefatigable tongue, too-a source of ever fresh en- tertainment to the English girl, to whom negro character, not as it is falsely presented in books or comic songs, but as it really exists in the south, full of indestructible self-esteem, dis- interested affections, and audacious wit and humor, was en- tirely new, quaint, and piquant. Not the least amusing to Marian was the air of perfect kindness and sincerity with which Jenny approved and patronized her, telling her that-the Eng- lish were "Jes as good as white people when they 'haved their- selves." And often the maiden's merry laugh would have rung out in silvery cadences, but that it was arrested on her budding lips by the thought of the suffering mourner on the sofa; to whom laughter, sunlight, and music, were as yet insupportable, Marian busied herself with making the tiny cottage more  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7871-00000062"/> 10B     THE  MSSING   BRIDE. comfortable and attractive. Remember it had but two rooms, one below and one- above, the upper one being nothing but a chamber in the roof. And Marian thanked Heaven that it would take but very small means to furnish both as neatly and prettily as needful, thus naturally with her bright, cheerful tem- per, finding in the very meagreness of space a cause of con- gratulation. Marian set about preparing and adorning that upper room for Edith. It was a very fair sized chamber, coarsely lathed and plastered, and roughly floored, and had a good sized window at each end. The east one with a view of the bay, the west with one of the forest. The only furniture of the room was two bedsteads and beds, covered with blue checked counterpanes, and a tall, three-legged, old pine toilet- table, without cover or looking-glass. Marian and Edith occu- pied this only sleeping-room, while Jenny slept down stairs upon a mattrass that was taken up every morning. Bnt Marian, as I said, set about preparing and adorning this humble chamber for Edith.  She went to B , and by the sacrifice of a rich pearl brooch, an heir-loom and Marian's only ornarment, she procured money to buy her materials and send them home in a hired cart. And the next day all her im- provements were so quietly made, as not to attract the atten- tion of'Edith, lying still upon the sofa, with the handkerchief over her face. And now see the room after Marian had metamorphosed it. The walls were whitewashed-the floor covered with delicate straw matting-the two beds with fine white counterpanesthe two windows were shaded with plain, deep-blue paper blinds, and draped with clear white muslin curtains; and her toilet- table covered with a top-piece and valance of white dimity, and adorned with a bright little looking-glass, and a pretty bottle of cologne, a tasteful pincushion, and other little matters. Opposite this toilet was a new wash-stand, with a pure white service. Near Edith's bed was an invalid's chair, with a foot cushion. And there were two plain stands, and two other chairs. Lastly, in one corner, stood a pretty new cradle, all ,j-    *  .   HOUSEK-EEPING AT OLD FIELD COTTAGE. 139 made up with its little bed and pillow and sheets-Marian's stolen, delightful work for a week past, and all covered by the finest white Marseilles quilt. It was near evening when the room was finished, and Marian stood with her cheeks glowing with exercise and satisfaction, contemplating her work-she thought the pearl brooch well bestowed, and never did the vainest beauty enjoy the display of her costhest jewels as Marian enjoyed this appropriation of her only one. Ah, if Marian could only have had in addition to the satisfaction of doing good, the pleasure of giving delight! But that she knew was impossible--she could not give Edith delight; nothing could do so. And her unspoken conclusion was en- dorsed by Jenny, who was tripping daintily over the clean straw matting, and settling here and there a fold of the white draperies. "But Lor' Gimini! it aint de fuss bit o'use, far as she's 'cernedI It's ebery singly bit hev away on she! ten to one she'll not 'serve whedder dese yere nice 'Sales quilts aint dem der funnelly ole blue cottin counterpins!

"We must have patience, and leave her to Nature a little longer. I have the greatest faith in Nature. 'Nature,' you know, 'is the handmaid of the Lord!'" "Is she? I nebber hear tell o' dat before. Yes, but now I thinks ob it, some handmaids 'lects ob der duty, an' idles about. Maybe dat's de way Nater do I Leastways, ef Nater didn't get Miss Edy out o' dat der putty soon, P'd try somet'in' else- 'deed me!" Marian smiled, and they went below-Jenny to get tea, and Marian to sit down by Edith's couch and ply her needle, her rosy fingers flying like a bird. At night, when Marian helped Edith up stairs-Jenny at- tending with a light-the invalid entered the chamber, casting her eyes around in a languid, absent manner, that left it in doubt whether or not she saw the change.

She don't notice a singly thing!"--failed to attract her attention. But Marian led her up to the little cradle, and asked, "What do you think of this, dear Edith?" The widow cast a weary, saddened glance upon the pretty novelty, and turning away hei eyes, said, mournfully, "It's no use dear; the child will die." "Not a bit of it " said Marian, cheerfully, "the child will live 1" No more was said then. Edith had spoken more than she had at any one time since her bereavement, and Marian hailed it as a promising symptom. And she thought that the time had now-come when it was right to modify her "let-alone" system in regard to Edith-when the mourner might be gently drawn, without pain, from her self-absorption, and interested in -the business of life and the hopes of the future. And Marian resolved to proceed accordingly. The next day Edith lay as usual upon the lounge, with her arms laid up above heri head, her slender white hands clasped, and the handkerchief thrown over her face. And Marian sat near her, busy with her needlework, her rosy  fingers flying;with their usual celerity. She was a dear, pleasant : girl, and a beautiful creature to look at as she sat there. Do you see her? in her plain, light-blue gingham dress, with her :plump, rosy arms and neck, and her fresh and blooming checks, and full, ripe lips, and clear, kind, blue eyes, and golden bronze hair, rippling in bright wavelets off her white forehead, and' gathered in a burnished knot behind, from which here and there a stray tress twists itself out in a tiny, glittering, spiral ringlet? Do you see her, as she bends lightly over her work, with her flying fingers-a work that never seemed toil, so pleasantly was it done, and so cheerful was her countenance, and so happy her voice. At length she took from her work-basket a tiny pair of infant's socks, that she had knit of white lamb's wool-now Marian thought if there was any article of a baby's dress pretty, suggestive, and even touching, it was the little socks-so holding them towards Edith, she said,   HOUSEKEEPING AT OLD FIELD COTTAGE. 141 "How do you like these, dear Edith? do you think they will do?"  The mourner did not hear; but upon Marian's repeating-the' question, she drew the handkerchief from her face, and turned her eyes upon her sister. "How do you like these little socks, Edith? Please look at them. I think they are pretty-and I have other pairs--rose- colored, and straw-colored, and azure." "Trifles I trifles I and useless-all!" said the sufferer, turning away her face. "Oh, Marian I make two shrouds instead. We shall die--I and my child." "Not you. Not either of you. You will live, and learn to enjoy life," said AMarian, cheerfully, as she resumed her work. "But, Marian, I wish that we may die I I hope and pray to die, with all the poor, feeble power of hoping and praying that is left in this broken heart 1 I hope and pray to die. It is all that I have left to wish for 1" "You have much better things than that to hope for, dear Edith." "Oh Marian! do yop know-can you know how hopeless, how joyless the future spreads before me? How loathsome is life-how welcome would be death!" "But you will get over this, dearest, dearest sister, you willX get over this. You are so young yet, dear Edith-only three or four years older than myself."' .        .  v- "So young, am I!" repeated the mourner, in a voice of de- spair.--" so young am II Ah I that is the very worst of all- the worst of all that is left, I mean-to think that I should have to carry this aching heart, this sore, sore heart through all the stages of life down to deep old age I Long ago, long ago I would have quieted this aching, throbbing heart, whose every pulse is a pang, in the first deep water that offered a resting place, but, for the fear of God 1"  "You forbore to die for the fear of God, go a step higher, dearest Edith," said Marian, her young face in a glow of faith and hope, ." resolve to live for the love of God 1" 9  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7871-00000064"/> "2     THE   M I I N  B IDE.

So come the heavenly ones, dearest Edith!" "You speak like one acquainted with grief-yet yon caniodt be, Marian. You I a young blooming, happy girl." "You think so I yet I am an orphan, dear Edith. Before I saw you, I had lost every one in the world who loved me-there was not one left. I saw my father die-then my mother--and Michael's father, whom I dearly loved-and lastly, Michael. Do you think I am heartless, dear EdithT? Do you think I did not share your grief for Michael? I did-not in the same intensity, for I know and realize what that which we call death really is. I have felt the spirits of my loved departed revisit me again!; I have felt them in the deeper insight into spiritual things, in the increased joys of :my soul's life- in its enlarged affections, elevated thoughts, and accession of faith and hope and love I feel that Michael watches over us -not only from his heavenly home-but he draws near to us -he sees -all that I  am trying to do to reconcile you to life; and that helps me to persevere.

What is the grave, but the packing place for the worn-out habiliments of the soul; our loved ones are 'not there, but risen.' If we do not feel it so, then is our religion a cold Theology-a soulless body of a creed-and Christ, the Redeemer, has lived   and died, and ASCENDED in vain 1" said Marian, with her beautiful face transfigured by inspiration. And all this time, while she spoke such high truths in her young wisdom, her slender fingers flew, plying her humble house- hold needle. CHAPTER   XI. THE  MAY  BLOSSOM. I would more spirits were like thine, That never casts a gloom before- Thou Hebel who thy hearts rich wine So lavishy to all dost pour "-LoWoell. "WILL you look at the baby now, dear Edith?" It was a fair scene and hour.-a pleasant, moonlight evening early in May, and the humble attic chamber at Old Field Cot- tage seemed lovely as the interior of some fairy temple. The two white draperied beds stood at opposite corners, on each side of the east window, and with wide space between them. The window-curtains of white muslin were looped aside, giving a clear view of the open sea, and admitting the moon rays, that filled the room with a lovely, soft light.   TEE  MAY  BLOSSOM.        145 Upon the right-hand bed, in a soft mist of white drapery, reposed Edith. Since the advent of her child, six hours before, she had lain in the healthful sleep of physical weariness. She/ was not only "as well," but better than could be expected." And at last she awoke, and Marian raised the infant in her arms, and standing at the mother's bedside, said, "Will you look at-the baby now, dear Edith?" "Oh  no, no-I cannot-I cannot!" said the invalid, turn- ing away, and covering her face with her hands. She was thinking, poor, fond mourner, of him who lay, "sleeping in his bloody shroud." "Please look at the poor baby, Edith, wont you? Please kiss her, and bless her, and then I will take her away." "Oh don't ask me I Oh I I cannot now-not just now- when I'm feeling-if he'd lived-how fond-how happy-" here the voice gave way, and the low sound of weeping was heard.      1 X Marian crossed the room, and turned down her own cover, and laid the little one in her own bed. But Jenny, who stood there stirring pap, was scandalized, was indignant. "Humph   So Nater is de hand-maid o' de Lord, is she? Well I for my part, I does think she's a good-for-nothing, 'lect- ful huzzy, as ever I see!

"Lazy fair Yes I she may be a lazy fair; but I tells you what-if she was a lazy darky, I know what 'ould come of her! 'Deed me!" Marian laughed her low, musical laugh. "Indeed, Jenny, if it were not for your company, I don't know that I could keep up my spirits all the time l" "No, honey, likely not, indeed chile-'cause you see, my 'ciety was always 'sidered edifyin' au' 'sides which, I'se had a  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7871-00000066"/>  good deal of aperients in life,. which has 'pared me to be a guide to de young.

"But," said Marian, laughing, "Mr. Adams is a very, very distant relative, and I even doubt if he'd acknowledge the re- lationship. "'Deed he I proud to do it I an' you so han'some 1"  Marian smiled, and blushed-she could not deceive even in jest. "I must explain all about this great old family to you to- morrow, Jenny," she said. "Do, chile II loves dearly to tell 'bout de quality." And all this time while they talked, Marian's busy hands were going as fast as ever. She was preparing some cool, light farinacious food for Editl. When it was ready, she took it to the bedside and persuaded her patient to swallow a few spoonsful. Then she handed the little waiter, with the bowl and spoon, to Jenny, saying, "Now, Jenny, you may go down stairs and spread your mat- trass and go to bed. i I intend to sit up. But be sure to leave some fire in tie fire-place, and a kettle of water, in case Edith should need something in the. night. I also shall want to come down and make myself a cup of tea towards midnight, to keep me awake till morning." "You 'tends for to kiM yourself . You jes' do!

It is true she sat by the east window, looking out upon the scene-upon the barren waste that lay between the cottage and the beach, and upon the sea, into which the crescent moon was just sinking, striking a slender line of diamond light across the waves. But at every moan or restless motion of her patient, she was softly and silently at her bedside to render assistance. Her services were so quiet, yet so effectual, they seemed like the charmed ministry of some spirit-loving-silent-and invisible. There was nothing in her mute footfall, and nothing in the color or material of her soft, gray gown, to annoy sensitive sight or hearing, and the tones of her voice possessed the spell of sooth- ing. The beautiful girl knew this, for she had studied it, and therefore she would not resign the duty that she felt no one else could fulfill as well as herself! And so she sat up night after night. And, in truth, several successive nights' watching did not seem to hurt her in the least degree. A short nap at noon, when both the mother and child were asleep, seemed sufficient to restore her. The finely organized creature had such a great fund of health and'vital energy. Upon the fourth day, Edith sat up in her easy-chair. Marian had wrapped her tenderly in' the new, soft, white flannel dress- ing-gown that she made for her, and; laid her gently back among the downy pillows of the chair. Then she softly combed. out the silken tresses of her hair, turning the slight flossy blackl ringlets around her fingers, until they fell like raveled silk each side the pearly forehead, and played in wavering shadows over the thin, fair, spiritual face. Marian thought she never had seen so lovely a face. And she took a little band-mirror from X the toilet-table and held it before Edith; but as soon as Edith caught the beautiful reflection of her own face-to Marian's sur- prise--she suddenly threw up her hands and disheveled all her hair, and hiding her face in the pillows, burst into an uncon- trolable fit of weeping. She was thinking of those dear, loved   THE   MAY  BLOSSOM.       149 eyes, now closed in death-those fond, appreciating eyes that had so delighted to watch every change of her changeful face l The merest trifle sometimes I the fall of her eyelashes, the wa- vering shade upon her fair cheek of some straying ringlet-all had a poetic- charm for him! Everything, everything--even her own beauty brought, back so vividly the image of him she had lost! Now that he could no longer rejoice in her beauty, she felt it to be painful-to be almost wrong to be beautiful for other people's pleasure 1 And she felt it would be a sort of  satisfaction to look plain and homely. And she understood how it must have been that the -old time, ugly, and repulsive 9"widow's cap" and "weeds" must have originated, not as a mere form, but in some sick, sick heart that felt-just as she did. Marian stood by Edith's side, patient and cheerful as usual, until the storm of grief had passed, and'then she said, "Let me make you tidy, dear Edith. You know your Aunt Henrietta will be here in a very few minutes now, and it would give her pain to see you this way." "Well-well-comb my hair if you must, but comb the curls out straight, and turn them plainly off my forehead. I cannot bear to look as I used to." Marian humored the invalid.  And Edith, with her silky black hair parted over her fair brow, and half covered with the little delicate lace cap, looked lovelier than before. It was im- possible to mar the beauty of that face. But Marian-kept the ,glass at a safe distance, wisely resolving not to wound the sensi- tive young widow again with the sight of her own loveliness. In the course Of half an hour Mrs. Waugh arrived in her car- riage, and very much inclined to scold Marian for not having sent her word of "the event" till the evening before. "But you know," said Marian, 'I had no one to send but Jenny, and it was impossible to spare her for the first three days. Besides there was no very imminent necessity. Edith was doing very well, and it is just as pleasant to you to come now and find her sitting up."          -  And then they entered Edith's chamber. 12*  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7871-00000068"/> 150     T1BE  MSSING   BIRIDE. The young mother sat as Marian had arranged her, looking the very picture of fragile, spiritual beauty. Upon her lap,-no longer banished, lay the baby. Henrietta was very tender-hearted, and this touching sight, of the widowed young mother and her new-born babe, impressed her to tears. She went up, very softly, however, and kissed Edith, and sat down and talked with her very quietly, and after a little while took the baby upon her own lap, and began to admire her. "And what is to be her name, Edith?" inquired Mrs. Waugh. Nobody had thought of that. Marian could not tell. Edith did not answer. "She must be baptized, you know." "I had not remembered it." "You had better call her 'Marian;' I am sure there is no one who so well deserves the compliment." " No-Marian is my good angel-buit-Marian what was his mother's name? strange! I never knew-he never chanced to tell me; but then we were so little time together; and his mother must have died before his recollection," said Edith, her voice almost drowned in unshed tears. "She did.- Her name was Miriam-she was a Jewess of the same tribe as his father." "Then let my child be called Miriam," said Edith. Mrs. Waugh had brought her carriage packed fullof things -pots of preserves and sweetmeats; jars of jelly and jam; packages of loaf sugar, tea, coffee, spices, beef-tongues, and many other articles in the eating line; and also rolls of fine flannel, and whole pieces of linen, and of lawn, and of cambric, and sundry other items in the clothing way. And she now went down stairs, accompanied by Marian, to overlook the unpacking of the carriage, and the packing away ofthe presents. Henrietta spent the whole day with Edith, and went away in the evening, well pleased with her visit, and with everything she had foundat Old Field Cottage.   THE  WMAY  BLOSSOM.       151 Edith recovered slowly, but surely. Yet Marian kept the baby at night.  "It is better for you and for the child, that I should keep her," said the young nurse-for you are not strong, Edith! You need unbroken rest to restore you. And, besides, all physicians agree that it is better for a young infant to sleep with a strong, healthy person, like myself.?' So the baby slept in Marian's bosom, not only then, but always. And as Edith lay in her bed at night, between asleep and awalke, she would often hear the young girl soothing the infant, cooing to her like a mother-dove to her young-and would wonder at the maternal tenderness that filled the- maiden's. heart for the baby. In after years, in the dark and tragic hours, Edith remembered these days and nights with a soul wrung with remorse, to think how little at the time she; had appreciated the lovely self-devotion of the young girl. When Edith was able to go down stairs, a very diferent scene to what the cottage grounds usually presented, met her view. Marian had industriously occupied herself with the adornment -of the Outside as well as the inside of the house. She had laid the little yard off in borders and beds,-and fer- tilized them well with seaweed, and stable compost, and kitchen slops, and in short, with every refuse animal and vegetable mat-  ter, that would otherwise have littered the premises--and-she had planted flowers and sowed seeds-and trained neglected vines, until the barren waste immediately around the house "bloomed and blossomed as a rose." And every shutterless window was deeply shaded with flowering annual creepers. The kitchen garden, a little beyond, yas also in a forward state of progress. Everything about the little home was metamor- phosed, as by an angel's hand.  But, alas, the young mistress of the house could take no pleasure in it. Her heart continued "exceeding sorrowful, even unto death,' and " would not be comforted, iiause he was not."      #        .         . - - 3r8 bf,"         a         ...  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7871-00000069"/> "UZii TH      - M I A N   B I DE I D. But Marian was not disheartened. "Edith," she said, reverently, "too much, perhaps, I have relied upon simple nature to heal your heart. Go, Edith, to the God and Father of nature-to your Father and Creator, who made your heart, and endowed it with those great affec- tions so liable to suffer, who knows as none else can know- how the wound lies, and how to heal it. Go, Edith, to your Maker. Seek Him earnestly, seek Him constantly, in prayer, until He blesses you. Sweep aside, as so many flies, all doubts and fears, and all conflicting creeds and doctrines about Him! And go, a spirit, to the father of Spirits-find the comfort there is in God, the Consoler I Oh 1 Edith, they tell us of God the Creator, God the Father; and awful, and beautiful, and joyous words they are indeed; 'Great tidings of great joy.' But, oh! Edith, none but the wretched, the forsaken, the be- reaved, and the stricken in heart, who seek Him, know the in- finite rest and comfort, 'the peace that passeth understanding,' the Divine joy found in GOD THE CONSOLER!" "And is that the secret of your happiness, Marian?" "That is the cause of my happiness, not the secret; God's glorious light is no secret but to the willfully blind!" And thus this household angel of the Lord led the mourner from the darkness of her sorrows into the Glorious Light. CHAPTER   XII. OU R FAY.

"But I cannot give you leave to do so, Lapwing; you: uncle's orders are peremptory upon that point l "I didn't ask leave, atunty --and as for uncles orders, yoi didn't mind them when you went!" "Hem-hem-m! That is a very different thing, Lapwing of which you are not competent to judge. When the comr mands of any human being in authority clash with the corn mands of God, we must obey the Creator rather than the creature. Justice and humanity required that I. should for once disregard your uncle's will, because it was not right. But re member this; Jacquelina, that if your uncle is not always exactly right, it is because no human being -possibly can be perfect- and he is not, upon that account, the less entitled to your re- spect and obedience." Jacquelina swallowed a rising yawn, and said, "Well, I don't know whether it is 'justice and: humanity, but something requires me to go and see Fair Edith's baby." "I can tell you its name, Lapwing-it is caprice." - "Well, anyway, I think I, too,-shall disregard uncle's wishes, because they are not right, and go, as you did, aunty. ' What's good for the gander is good for the goose.' - "Yes, but, Lapwing, What's good for the goose may be fatal to the gosling, as disobedience often is to a child."'

"Jenny is getting insolent, I'm afraid; she's no example to you. And you must obey your uncle." They had, by this time, reached the door of the room formerly occupied by Edith. Mrs. Waugh unlocked it, and entered, followed by Jacquielina. The good lady then hdsited:all the windows, and threw open all the shutters, and a flood-:f light 'S.      1 ,-d        .      *    &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7871-00000070"/> 154-     THE    M I SSI TG  BRIDE. poured in, filling ;every nook and corner of the room. The place remained just as Edith had left it nearly twelve months before. Here, in addition to the heavy and permanent furni" ture appertaining to the bed-chamber, were articles that should have been considered Edith's own peculiar personal property. A small book-case, .with glass doors, through which you could read the titles of a well-selected set of books; a small writing- desk furnished; a neat work-stand; a pretty work-box; a low sewming-chair and foot-cushion; two port-folios, filled with drawings and engravings, upon :the table; small framed pic- tures on the walls; and, statuettes of saints and angels on the mantel-piece. Jacquelina had not entered this chamber since Edith's de- parture, and she looked around with, curiosity, and then turning to Mrs. Waugh with surprise, said, "Why, aunty, I thought uncle had sent all Fair Edith's things to her the day after she was married?" "He sent her wardrobe and jewelry, but these other things he considered belonged to the room, and not to Edith," i"But, dchnlt he buy them and .give them to her?" "Yes, to ornameint her room, not to take away," he says. "Oh, that was so-' mean, she was going to say, butt Jac- quelfina sometimes restrained herself.

All the house-servants, except Maria, and all the field labor- ers, except Stupe, had also gone to church. This last named individual was a sort of nondescript functionary about the pre- mises-useful in nothing but implicit and literal obedience- sometimes a dangerous gift, as the Commodore had once proved, when in sending Stupe with a candle to the cellar one night to unpack some hampers of champagne, -he had said, "And now be sure to set the straw a-fire, you black rascal." "When, half-an-hour after, the boy returned, the master asked, in some anxiety, "Did you set anything on fire, you scoundrel?" "Yes, sir, I sot de straw a-fire, as you telled me, but de cellar is so damp it wont burn good 1"     # You may fancy the terror, confusion and trouble, before the flames could be extinguished. This incurable thick-headedness   o   R i?A Y.       157 'had fastened upon him the sobriquet of Stupid or Stupe-his real name was Festus. Jacquelina relied upon Stupe as the tool of the plan she had in view for the day. She waited until she thought the church party had got a mile or two away, and then she went out of the front door to look for him. She found him in the front yard trimming the grass.  "Hi, Festus I what are you doing there when you ought to be getting up the cart?" "The cart, Miss?" repeated Stupe', staring with all his eyes.' "Certainly, the cart. Of course, the cart What are you thinking of? I lay anything you had better let your old Marse come back and find you havn't got the cart up 1" "I wasn't 'tending nothing else, miss.

"Catch a strong horse, and hitch him to the single horse cart, and bring it up to the door, now, directly 1 Make haste, now l" "Yes, miss," and Stupe ran off to do her bidding, while Jacquelina entered the house to equip herself for a ride. Maria was mending her own clothes in her mistress's room. Jacquelina called to h*r--     , "Maria, you have just got to come down here, and help me to pack up these things.

The maid came down without the slightest demur or doubt; so much was she carried away by the assured manner of her little mistress.      , By the time they had wrapped up all the statuettes and vases, and had taken down all the pictures, and packed up all the books in a large trunk, they heard the sound of the horse-cart drawing up before the door. Then Jacqielina went out, and called Stupe in to help to lift all the furniture out. The book- case and the writing-desk, the work-stand and. the work-box, the sewing-chair and the foot-stool, the box of pictures, the box of statuettes, and the trunk of books, were all taken in turn, and carefully packed into the cart. It was a light load;:for a strong horse, and when all was put in, Jacquelina locked the room door, hung u' the key, and. told Stupe to help her up into the cart, as sho was to go with the things. Here, for the first time, Maria made some objection. "'You musn't' go, indeed, Miss Linal You know you've cotched cold already, and has got sich a berry bad ear-ache 1" '":My ear-ache is well I And I'd like to see who'll stop me!" said Sans Souci, leaping, with Stupe's assistance, up into the cart. Stupe walked by the side of the horse, cracked his whip, and the cart started, leaving poor Maria behind, in doubt- and un- easiness, not at all upon account of the furniture and the books -but on account of Jacquelina's whim of accompanying them. The cart proceeded on its way tolerably well, until they got into the bad road leading through the forest. Now, poor Stupe was a miserable driver, and there is no knowing how soon their necks might have been broken, had they not chanced to meet Cloudesley Mornington, on his way to the hall. "Oh I Cloudy I Cloudy Morning I I am so glad to see you I I just want you to help me in a splendid piece of-of--" "Mischief?"- "No!" said Sans Souci, indignantly. '"You always think-- mischief. No--a piece of good work, sir." "Ytou had better let me get up there in Stupe's place and drive-he'll smash the cart, and endanger your life, yet."   OUR   FAY.         159 "That's just what I want you to do, Cloudy!" "What? Smash the cart and throw you out?' "No, you know it isn't I I want you to get up and drive. But--were you going to the hall?s' "Yes!" "Well, then, you can just let St'upe take your horse, and lead him to the house, while you drive on to Old- Fields.'" "Is it there you're going?" "Yes." "Whew I'- "Now, what did you say ' whew' for? Never mind, get in, and I'll tell you all about it as we go along." Cloudesley threw the bridle to the boy, and sprang upon the seat near Jacquelina, and drove on. When Stupe was left far behind, Sans Souci explained to Cloudesley the business that she was upon. "Cloudy" looked very grave for awhile, and- "Lina," he said, " this looks to me, very much like--not ex. actly shop-lifting, but house-lifting, if one might call it so!" "It's no such thing, now, Cloudy 1 There I Aunty and every- body think Edith ought to have them, because they know undo did give her the things, though now he wants to withhold them out of-curiousnessl But never mind, Mr. Cloudy ' If you don't want to go with me-if you are afraid, you may just get down, and go back, and I'll call Stupe-he's not afraid, poor slave boy as he is!"

"Oh I of course you'd take the floor, whether it were given you or not."   a By this time they had got out of the forest, and into the open country and good roads. "Now make Samson travel  You know he'll have a good time to rest at Old Fields, and no load .to bring back," : "Except a load of sin!" said Cloudesley, as he put whip to the powerful draught horse, and they moved rapidly on. They soon came in sight of the sea-shore, and soon after came dpon the little cottage, now half concealed in climbing and clustering vines, azure morning glories, rose-colored and purple; flowering peas, and scarlet running beans, climbed up and shaded all the windows, and overran the little lattice work over the ';' door. In the yard before the cottage were blooming damask roses, and- white lilies, golden head daffodils and jonquils, blue Vhyacinths, variegated tulips, and other sweet spring flowers. In the door, canopied more royally than a queen by the over- arching vines, stood Marian, with her white dress and amber- hued tresses fluttering in the breeze. "Oh I My I how pretty I Did you--did you ever see any- thing near so pretty?"                 * ', "Which do you mean, the cottage or the young lady?" "Oh I all together Hthoth!-the picture. Oh I My I how sweet!" exclaimed Jacquelina, as they pulled up before the gate. Marian, from her position, had recognised the blue cart, and Samson, the draught horse, from Luckenough, which had been at the cottage twice before to bring things sent by Mrs. Waugh to Edith. And now it was with more pleasure than surprise that she saw it once more stand well laden before the gate. She could not, however, recognize-either of the young people, whom she had never seen before.  Nevertheless, as soon as the cart stopped, she came down the walk smiling, and holding, out her hand to the little girl that jumped off the cart and jerked open the gate, and rushed into the yard, exclaiming eagerly, "Where's the baby?" "Who are you, my dear?" inquired Marian, catching her hand to restrain her, yet smiling kindly on her all the time.   OUR   FAY. s        161 "Oh!

Then Marian invited them into the house. . Edith, fully recovered, sat-in her rocking-chair with the infant in her lap. Sans Souci was about to fly to her, and, perhaps, seize the child-the prize H-the wonder I But the fair and fragile appearance of the young mother subdued her impetuosity, and she came softly to Edith's side and knelt down, and looked at the baby some time, lightly kissing its forehead several times, and saying, "Oh I Fair Edith, I do love your little baby so much l' May Cloudy come and see it?" "Oh, yes," said Edith. "Oh! Cloudy, do come and see the wonderfullest little beauty you ever saw in your life!" And Cloudesley came, and took and pressed the hand that Edith, held out to him, and then to conceal the tears that came rushing to his eyes, he stooped and tenderly lifted the\ irtfant from her lap and carried it off to the window.

Happily also, old Jenny entered the room just then, and had to make her joyful greetings. And then Cloudesley, assisted by Jenny, went out to unload the cart. The things were brought in, and Marian, aided by Cloudesley, unpacked and arranged them. Meanwhile, Samson was unharnessed, watered, fed, and turned out to grass until the afternoon. Then Jenny kindled the fire and put on the tea-kettle for a coffee dinner--to please poor Edith there was always a tea or coffee dinner at the cottage, as there is in many other houses where the family consists wholly of women and girls. There were, besides, nice lighthread and fresh butter, a broiled chicken, cold beef tongue, and peach preserves with cream. Jacquelina and Cloudesley heartily enjoyed seeing the meal prepared under their own eyes on the neat village hearth, and Jacquelina assisted Marian to set out the little round table, and spread upon it the snowy cloth, and place on that the semi-transparent white - ser- vice, -that she declared "looked like refined moonlight." And -as for Cloudesley, no alderman ever enjoyed his venison and turtle soup, eaten with a golden spoon, more than he did the coffee; truth to tell, Cloudy was remarkable for his devotion to the Arabian berry. And in the cottage everything was so snug, so cool, and so pleasant, that beautiful spring- day, and the bright little fire on the hearth was not inharmonious with the open doors and the fluttering white muslin curtains and overhang- ing vines, through the partings of which could be seen on one side of the house a view of the sea, and on the other the flower yard and fields and forest. The meal was so impromptu, so easy, and the party that gathered around the table so youthful, so keenly alive to pleasure in every form, even Edith's pale cheek brightened into smiles. Soon after dinner, Cloudy went to speak to Sans Souci, who sat by the baby's cradle. "Lina, had I not better harness the horse to the cart, and get ready to start home?,c,    OUR   FAYT         163 "'No!" "But it is getting late." "Now, Cloudy Morning, don't you fret yourself into a fidget IN I am going to stay till sundown, and go home by moonlight." "But, my dear Lina, what will your uncle say to you?" "Why, he'll storm at me, dreadfully, and that he'll do any- how? It's as well to be hanged for a sheep as a lamb I yes, and better, I think. I like to have the worth of a scolding, if I am to get the scolding. I know thereql be a tremendous storming up at home, but I intend to earn it, every bit of it; and then it will be such a satisfaction to know I deserved it, and that it was all right 1" As the imp said this, her malicious blue eyes, blazing with mischief and defiance, met those of Marian fixed upon her- fixed most intensely upon her-and most strange was the effect of that mutually encountering gaze upon the beautiful English girl. While yet unable to withdraw her fascinated eyes, her cheeks- were overspread with a paleness, and sweeping her hand across her brow, as though to dispel some baleful vision, she sank into a- chair. So sudden was her pallor and her sinking, that Edith and Cloudesley sprang to her side. "You are sick-you are sick, dear Marian, what is it? will you lie down?" asked the former, while the latter brought a glass of water. "' Thank you, how very strange and foolish," said the young girl, taking the glass and drinking the water, and then again passing her hand back and forth across her brow, as if to clear away a cloud. "What was it, dearest Marian, that made you ill!" "I really do not know; I cannot account for it at all-a sudden panic seized me and I fell-it is passing away now-in fact it is past;' smiling and- blushing at the :miacoantable emotion; "now, indeed, it is quite gone," she added, still more brightly smiling in Edith's ,anxious face, and rising and lightly shaking off all the clouds from-her sunny presence I Sans Souci stood by the window in the attitude and wit the expression of deep thought. *  v .  .  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7871-00000075"/> Cloudy," she said, as the youth approached her; "look at me--have I got the evil eye?" "Why, yes, to be sure you havel Didn't you know it "Now, Cloudy' you just be serious, have I got the evil eye?"  asked the imp, in a low, fearful whisper. "Why, no, you little goose; what makes you ask such a simple question?'-: "Why, because, just now when I was laughing and thinking of how I would do uncle, I happened to look up in Marian's face, and the instant, she caught my'eyes she turned pale and sank down, and I felt as if I had killed her." "Pooh! your looking at her had nothing to do with it," said Cloudy; "and now I tell you, Lina, we had better set out home, or we'll not get there by nine o'clock!" "And I don't care if we don't get there till twelve I 'In for a penny, in for a pound,' as Solomon Weismann says; and be- sides, I've .got ever so many things to see first, that Marian promised to show -me." And so the, Jay had I. First of all, she must go up stairs with Marian and see the pretty new chamber furniture, and all he baby's pretty little clothes, that were laid away so nicely ill n upper bureau drawer. And then she must see the wren's lest in the gourd out at the chamber window, and hear about its raking the family up with its singing early in the morning. knd next, she had to visit the tortoiseshell cat and her two ittens; and, lastly, she had to go down to the shed and see ,ily, the handsome white Durham heifer, fed. And during all Iis time, the elf was so interested in the sweet life around her, ad so modified by its subduing influences, that when at last e came in, holding Marian's hand, she looked gentle and mild tough to have been Marian's little sister. Jenny had tea on e, table, and Cloudesley had Samson harnessed to the cart. ), after tea, the young visitors took leave of Edith and Marian, d  kissed the forehead of the sleeping baby, and departed. Marian had put a  beautiful posey in the hands of Jacquelina,   OUR   FAY.         165 telling her that the next time she went to Benedict, she would buy a little rocking chair, so that her little visitor should have a comfortable seat when she came again. "And I can rock the baby?" "Yes "1 said Marian, kissing her with her smiling, rosy lips. And then the cart drove off. Jenny walked by its side some distance to the first road gate, sending endless messages of respect and love and remembrance to every member of the household of Luckenough, from her master (" poor ole forsook benighted sinner," as she called him,) and her mistress, down to Stupe, the yard-sweeper. Meantime Marian had returned to the house, smiling, roseate, cheery as usual; and making some pleasant remark about the departing visitors, she took her sewing and sat by the sea-view window to work. But Edith drew up to her side. "Marian, I want you to tell me, dear, what it really was that agitated you so?" Marian laughed. "I accept all experiences in physiological phenomena, Edith, even that, strange and unaccountable as it was? You will smile; but as I happened to meet that child's blue eyes, blazing with an insufferable light, while her whole form dilated as instinct with mischief and charged with de- struction, I know not how it was, but some fell spirit, apart from the child, seemed yet to gaze at me and threaten me through her eyes; and a sudden panic seized me, and I sank with the strangest impression, with thefeeling of a strong man's arm catching me in a vice-like grip, and a sharp knife plunged into my chest--"  Marian shuddered in spite of herself. " It may be something-it may be a presentiment or a vision-or it may be nothing more than the effect of disordered nerves; per-, haps we drink too much coffee; and yet I am perfectly well  But the affair is not worth so many words, dear Edith, -and no that I have satisfied your curiosity, I will not give the subje? another thought.' And Marian resumed her needle-work, her fingers flying with accelerated speed to make up for lost time., Marian had sometime :previous got through" all the little **  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7871-00000076"/> OIU     THE  MSSING   BRIDE. household sewing, and now she employed herself in working collars and caps, which she left at the village shops to be sold, and in the scarcity of such articles there, they commanded a ready sale.

They were just entering the precincts of Luckenough. It was after ten o'clock, and as they entered the lawn, the arrival of a cart at such an unprecedented hour, set all the dogs upon the premises to barking. And Cloudy had to use his luing and his whip, too, to conquer a peace, before they woQ recognize him.

But just as Cloudy seized the knocker, the door was cautiously opened, and Mrs. Waugh drew him in, making a sign of silence. Then she beckoned Sans Souci, who entered, for the first-time in her life, in a sort of awe. And lastly, she let her fellow watcher, old Oliver, out, "to put the horse and cart a-way.

We have seen sufficient of Commodore Waugh's edifying method of family discipline to understand exactly how it was. The result was this: that Sans Souci was sentenced to a month's imprisonment in her chamber -which was first--when Old Nick cooled down a little, com- muted to a week's, and next, when uncle began to be ennuyee for the company of his little Jacko, to a day's confinement. As for Cloudesley, who had come in for his full share of abuse, it was decided that he should be sent to sea immediately-nor was there any commutation of this sentence]! For the affection growing up between tUe little girl of ten, and the youth of six- teen, was already beginning to give the Commodore uneasi- ness, as likely at some future time to interfere with his plane in favor of "Grim." "Who knows when the nonsense called love germinates. -I'r sure I can't remember when----no, when Henrietta took pos- session of me, soul, body, and estate l" Commodore Waugh, by reason of his great services in the Revolution, as well as his late rank in the Navy, and his ex- tensive political connexion, had ample influence to procure for his ward a midshipman's warrant, and to get him appointed to a good ship. And the old sailor made a journey to Washington City for the purpose. And since he went upon a benevolent errand, it would be invidious to relate how much peace befell Luck-: enough during his absence I He came back at last, bearing the warrant that metamorphosed Cloudy into a naval officer.

And after an absence of two'weeks, he re- turned to Luckenough, to wait orders. He soon received them, to join the ship "Susquehanna upon or before a stated day. The intervening time was spent by Cloudesley at Luckenough, where Mrs.' Waugh, Mrs. L'Oiseau, the maid Maria, and: even Jacquelina, all devoted themselves to his service, until his linen was made up, and his wardrobe in perfect order for a three years' voyage. As for Sans Souci, to the surprise of every- body, she seemed perfectly delighted with the idea of Cloudesley's going to sea as a midshipman. She entered into the spirit of the thing with all her heart and soul I And after having assisted to get his wardrobe in order, she helped to pack his sea- chest. Cloudy, on his part, promising to bring her any num- ber of parrots, monkeys, and other animal and vegetable and mineral curiosities from foreign parts. "Poor. Lapwing I she never parted with any one she loved, for any length of time, in all her life, and she doesn't know what it is when it comes 1" said good Henrietta, noticing the child's high spirits. Jacquelina excessively admired Cloudesley's new uniform, and nothing would do but he must put on the full. parade dress, that she might admire him in it. So, to gratify her, and to please himself, too, maybe, as well as to "astonish the natives" of Luckenough generally, perhaps, Cloudy donned his hand- somest uniform. Sans Souci was delighted, enraptured, en- thusiastic. "Cloudy?^ "Well,. Lina?" "I want you to save that suit of uniform for me 1" "Now, Lina!" -:"Yes, I dol I want you, when you've worn it out, or out- grown it, to put it away and save it for me--I want to keep it, because it is the first uniform you ever wore I Now, will you do it?

Sans Souci was half delirious with delight and admiration, seized both his hands, and holding them, danced up and down before him-her eyes dancing more than her feet, Suddenly her manner changed-her bright face- was overshadowed- "YouT are 'most a man now, Mr. Cloudy," she said. "Well I what of that, Lina?" "I'm only a little girl." "And what of that?' "You'll go and fall in love with a grown lady." I shall do no such thing, Lina. What put such a notion in your head?" "Doctor Solomon said so P" "Solomon's a fool 1" "Yes, I know! but fools speak truth, they say." "Not in this instance, Lina."  "No? And you wont fall in love with a grown lady?" "No, surely not." "Not if they're ever so pretty, and ever so rich, and want you to, ever so much?" "No, no, no, and a thousand times no, Lina!" "And you wont ever marry anybody but me-will you, Cloudy  .        -   -  "No, Lina, I pledge my word I will never marry anybody but you." "God bless your dear, sweet, darling heart of you, I do say I I knew you wouldn't," she exclaimed with delight. "Oh, Cloudy I I do love you so much I I do love you better than the whole world put together."

Cloudy was full of spirits, and so was she. On taking leave, she threw herself for the last time around Cloudy's neck, exclaiming, as usual,  "Oh I Cloudy! I do love you best of all in the whole world 1" And he returning the parting caress, answered, as always, "And so do I you, Lina I But you wont say yout love me when I come back!" "Wont I, then I If I don't, you may call me a big story- teller 1" And so, without sentimentality or tears, the boy and girl separated. Cloudesley entered the carriage with the Commo- dore, and was driven off towards Benedict. And Jacquelina re-entered the lonesome house-very lonesome it seemed indeed with Cloudy and the pleasant bustle all gone, and the excite- ment of his going all over, and the reaction at hand! How empty Cloudy's room looked I He would not be in that room again for three years at least 1 Three years I what an intermina- ble time I Say never at once I It had not struck the child in that manner before, but now it did with all its force! And now she felt stunned, amazed, with only the power left to won- der why she had not realized what this parting truly was before I There was nothing left of Cloudy's in the room, except an old pair of boots-but "Jacko" thought they looked so like Cloudy-at least they so reminded her of Cloudy, that she fell upon them in a vehement fit of grief, the first she had felt upon his account. What made it worse for poor Lina, was the fact her mother and her aunty had also gone to Benedict to make some purchases, and to see Cloudy off. And the house was left to herself, and Maria, her maid. So Jacquelina mourned, with no one- to comfort her. About the middle of the forenoon, however, there happened to arrive two visitors from C--, namely, Miss Nancy Skamp and her accomplished nephew, Mr. Solomon Weismann, the medical student. They had come in total ignorance of the ab- Sence of thb family for that-day. However, that made no   BANS  SCUCI'S   FIRST   GRIEF.    178 difference at Luckenough. Maria informed the guests that her mistress would be home in the afternoon, and would be very glad to find them; also, that Miss Jacquelina was very much down about Master Cloudesley's going away, and that it would be kindness for them to stay and cheer her up. And therefore Miss Nancy Skamp and her nephew-neither of whom had the : slightest idea of going back -charitably consented to remain. They were shown into the parlor;,into which Jacquelina pre- sently came to bid them welcome. Poor Sans Souci's eyes were red, and her face was swelled with crying. Miss Nancy Skamp saluted the child with a kiss, and after asking about the health of her mother, and her aunty, and the Commodore, &amp;c., began to "cheer" the little hostess up with all the en- livening gossip she could think of--how Peter Semmers was going to have his leg taken off, because mortification had set in; and how Doctor Brightwell's little boy had lost his eyesight since he had the measles; and how widow Lloyd's son had been taken up for petty larceny, and his mother had lost her reason, and tried to drown herself, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. But none of these things appeared to raise Jacquelina's spirits in the least degree. And presently Solomon commenced. He had his own pet theory of curing grief, namely, upon the Homoeopathic prin- ciple. So he began, "So, Cloudy is gone, Miss Jacquelina?" "Yes," said the child, trying to command herself, and to behave "like a lady." "Poor Cloudy I how long is he going, to be absent?" "Three-ee years!" cried Sans Souci, beginning to falter-and lose her self control. "Oh  poo-oor Cloud-dy!" said Solomon, in the most pa- thetic of tones. "OhI Oh, dear  Oh, hoo-ool" sobbed Sans Souci, still trying valiantly to suppress an outhreak of grief. '"Poor, dear Cloud-dy I Away upon the stormy sea for-' three-whole-years!.

"Oh oh I don't I I shall smother II shall die I Oh I hecca I hecca 1" gasped Jacquelina, struggling for breath. "And then to have to climb up to the mast-head in the dreadful storms, and be rocked about between the thundering and lightning clouds, and the boiling ocean waves, until maybe he is shaken off, and pitched into the depths of the sea, and drowned "  "Ohl heccal hecca'! hoo-oo " gasped Sans Souci, really suffocating. "And then if he makes the least objection to that sort of treatment, to be court-martialed for mutiny, and hanged like a dogat the yard-arm!" said the merciless Solomon. "Oh! hecca Il hecca--hoo-oo--cahoo!" gasped and strug- gled Jacquelina, as she fell back in spasms.

I have my own theory'of the treat. ment and cure of grief. Now, grief is a passion that acts powerfully upon the body, and is reacted upon in the same de- gree by the body. Thus grief tends to surcharge the heart and lungs with blood, making that sense of weight and heat that causes the frequent sigh. Now, what is a sigh but the drawing in of a deep draught of cold air to relieve the heat of the chest? Tears also relieve, by throwing off the superabundance of fluid pressing against the brain. Sobs and spasms and so on, are better still, for they tend to drive away the blood that might congest near the heart. In a word, sighs, tears, ind sobs are the agents appointed by- nature to relieve body and mind, by throwing off the heat and weight accumulated by grief, and dis- pelling the congestion by sending the blood in healthy circula- tion through the extremities. Hence the ineffable relief you women feel after having what you call a good cry I It is your suppressed grief that kills." ("Yes; I have heard silent sorrow is very apt to break the heart," said Miss Nancy, sentimentally. "No, it doesn't break the heart, neither I that is another popular fallacy. Every physician knows the heart can't break I Why, it is about the toughest part of the human body."- "It has need to be, I am- sure," said Miss Nancy, la- conically.             / "Well, and it is, and it never breaks; when grief kills, as it does sometimes, from suppression, there is usually a conges- tion of the portal circle, a failure of the gaglionic nerves, or, perhaps, a general atrophy, but never a broken heart-a post- mortem examination would probably find the heart the sound- estkof all the members. Grief never would kill, however, if it wa'n't for that humbug 'fortitude.' Now, fortitude is in direct opposition to the laws of nature. Fortitude has slain more than grief or pain.

"But I would not trouble myself about him, if I were you, either; for you may take my word for it, he wont trouble him. self about you long!" "I don't want him to, I'm sure I But I know he'll think of me!" said Jacko. "Not he, indeed I What I Why, you're nothing but a little girl! and he is a gentleman and an officer, and he'll go to foreign countries, yes, and to foreign courts also; officers go everywhere, and he'll see many beautiful and accomplished ladies; not little chits of children,. but grown ladies, who will admire him, and dote on him;, ladies always dote on officers, especially handsome young officers like him, and he'll never think of you again 1" "He will I Cloudy will I I don't care if the queen falls in love with him, Cloudy wont forget me I We're engaged!"

"All was confused and undefined In her all-jarred and wandering mind, A chaos of wild hopes and fears;  And now in laughter now in tears, But madly still in each extreme, She strove with that convulsive dream."-Byron. IT was a jocund morning in early summer-some five years after the events related in the last chapter.  The sun had risen in cloudless splendor above the bright waters of the Chesapeake, and all nature rejoiced in the beauty ,and glory of the dayl  There was gladness in the radiant morning sky I gladness in the fresh elastic air I1' gladness in the sparkle and flash of the fluid emerald waves I gladness in the dance of the dewy forest leaves I gladness in the smiles of the blooming flowers  and rapture in the jubilant carolling of a thousand birds that sent up their morning song of praise and thanksgiving. ;  The matin hymn of all nature. was a Gloria-in-Excelsis. Old Field Cottage, standing in the midst of this scene, was a perfect gem of rural beauty. The Old Fields themselves no longer deserved the name--the repose of years had restored them to fertility, and now they were blooming in pristine youth --far as the eye could reach between the cottage gid the forest, (1m)  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7871-00000082"/> and the cottage and the sea-beach/,the fields were covered xith a fine growth of sweet clover, whose verdure was most refresh- ing to the sight. The young trees planted by Marian, had grown up, forming a pleasant grove around the house. The sweet honeysuckle and fragrant white jasmine, and the rich aromatic, climbing rose, set and trained by Marian, had run all over the walls and windows of the house, embowering it in verdure, bloom and perfume. And upon this glorious summer morning Marian had come out into the flower yard to enjoy the fresh, invigorating air, and to see the sun as it were, rise up from the depths of the sea, touch- ing with living fire every sparkling emerald wave I She was standing at the little wicket gate-there was a rustic arch span- ning the gateway. She had trained morning-glories to climb over it, and now  she stood beneath them rejoicing in the beauty and splendor of her best beloved flowers, rejoicing with a shade of pensiveness in her joy-for how perfect, yet how evanescent was the beauty of these morning-glories, these most lovely and fragile and ephemeral of all Flora's children. In perfect harmony with the freshness and splendor of the hour, was the beautiful girl, as she stood carelessly under the arch. of morning-glories-a  very Hebe I a very goddess of joyous life and health, and summer and sunshine. Into what a glorious fullness and perfection of beauty had the maiden ripened t Her finely developed form had attained a prouder height and richer fullness, and was suffused with the fresh, cool, roseate Bush of pure blood and perfect health; her superb bosom and shoulders had a more charming contour-and her fine head arose with a nlueenlier grace. Her rosy cheeks were richer and brighter in their bloom; her clear blue eyes were darker in hue and deeper in expression, and her luxuriant golden bronze hair was brighter in the sunshine and darker in the shade than hereto- fore. She wore her hair as before--parted over the snowy forehead, rippling in tiny burnished wavelets down each side the blooming cheeks, and gathered into a shining mass behind, from which escaped here and there a  fugitive tress, twisting itself into a  glittering spiral ringlet.    WANDERING     FANNY.       179 While Marian stood enjoying for a few moments the morn- ing hour, she was startled by the sound of rapid footsteps, and then by the sight of a young woman in wild attire, issuing from lthe grove at the right of the cottage, and flying like a hunted hare towards the house. Marian impulsively opened the gate, and the creature fled in, frantically clapped to the gate, and stood leaning with her back against it, and panting with haste and terror. She was a young and pretty woman-pretty, notwithstand- ing the wildness of her staring black eyes and the disorder of her long black hair that hung in tangled tresses to her waist. Her head and feet were bare, and her white gown was spotted with green stains of the grass, and torn by briars, as were also her bleeding feet and arms. Marian felt for her the deepest compassion ; a mere glance had assured her that the poor, pant- ing, pretty creature was insane. Marian took her hand and gently pressing it, said, "You look very tired and faint-come in and rest yourself and take breakfast with us."' The stranger drew away her hand and- looked at Marian from head to foot. But in the midst of her scrutiny, she suddenly sprang, glanced around, and trembling violently, grasped the gate for support. It was but the tramping of a colt through the clover that had startled her. "Do not be frightened; there is nothing that can hurt you; you are safe here.'? "And wont he come?"  "Who, poor girl?"  "The Destroyer!" "No, poor one, no destroyer comes near us here; see how quiet and peacable everything is here i" The wanderer slowly shook her head with a cunning, bitter smile, that looked stranger on her fair face than the madness itself had looked, and, "So it was, there," she said, " but the' Destroyer was'at hand, and the thunder of terror and destruction burst upon our quiet  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7871-00000083"/> 180      THE   MSSING  BRIDE. "but I forgot-the fair spirit said I was not to think of that --such thoughts would invoke the fiend again," added the poor creature, smoothing her forehead with both hands, and then flinging them wide, as if to dispel and cast away some painful concentration there. "Look at the flowers," said Marian, " are they not beautiful this- morning?" The stranger's face softened into a sweet, placid, pensive tenderness, and, "Yes,"-she said, very slowly, "the flowers were always very kind to me, the dear, blessed flowers-they never change to me as others change-they never call me ' Crazy Fan,'-nor Poor iFan,'--they don't seem to think I am so-and they smile on me, and lean towards me, and love me like I was another flower." "And so you are, poor wanderer, a broken, storm-beaten, faded flower-but a flower that may yet bloom in Paradise," thought Marian, as she reached her hand to gather a white lily, and hand it to the stanger. But the hand of the poor stroller prevented her. "Oh, do not- break the lily I If you knew what a heavenly message the white lily brings," she said, " and oh I if you knew how sad it is to be broken off and never find your root of life again I I was broken off, but the- broken flowers are happier than I, for they die i" "Because you are immortal, and must live to recover, in another and better world, the treasures you have lost here," said Mariana, gravely and sweetly. "I know-I know!" murmured the maniac, softly, to herself, "' but why am I shut out so long?" - "We cannot tell-we must all wait our time. But, come into the house, Fanny-you said your name was Fanny, did you not?"  "Yes," said the stranger, suddenly-changing her manner, and breaking into song.

And now come in and lie down on the sofa, and rest, while I make you a cup of coffee. Come l come into the house 1" But the same expression of cunning came again into the poor creature's face, as she said-- "In the house? No, no-nono! Fanny has learned some- thing!

"No I no I I can't go so near the house I I can't indeed I I am the Doomed, and Fate follows in my footsteeps!" said the poor creature, pulling back. "What do you mean?

"NoI no I It was not my faultl But if the plague had seized me--if I had been a" leper-What was I going to say? Oh!"And the maniac clasped her temples, and her features grew sharp, and her eyes intense, as if in pursuit of an idea, that she seemed now to have found, now to have lost. At last, suddenly she raised her eyes, and gazed intently into Marian's face, and then she gave a start, and her features began to work strangely. "Are you Marian?" she asked abruptly. "Yes, that is my name." "Oh, I oughtn't to have come here I I oughtn't to have come here!" "Why? What is. the matter? Come, be balm! Nothing can hurt you or us here!" "Don't lovel Marian, don't lovel Be a nun, or drown yourself, but never love!" said the woman, seizing the young girl's hands, gazing on her beautiful face, and speaking with . intense and painful earnestness. "Why? Love is life. You had as well tell me not to live as not to love. Poor sister I I have not known you an hour, yet your sorrows so touch me, that my heart goes out towards you, and I want to bring you in to our home, and take care of you," said'Marian, gently. "You do?" asked the wanderer, incredulously. "Eteaven knows I do I I wish to nurse you back to health and calmness." \f"Then I would not for the world bring so much evil to you I Yet it is a lovelier place to die in, with loving faces around.

C   ome, drive away all these evil fancies and let me take you into the cottage," said Marian, takingher rand. Yielding to the influence of the young girl, poor Fanny suffered hersel to be led a few steps towards the cottage; then, with a piercing shriek, she suddenly snatched her hand away, ryinga-- i-e rt "I should draw the lightning down upon your-head I am doomed I I  must not enter!"And she trned and fled out of the gate. Marian gazed after her in the deepest compassion, the tears filling her3kind blue eyes.  "Weep not for me, beautiful and loving Marian, but for your- self-yourself!" Marian hesitated. It were vain to follow and try to draw the wanderer into the house; yet she could not bear the thought of leaving her. In the meantime the sound of the shriek had brought Edith out. She  came, leading little Miriam by the hand. 4 aEdith was scarely changed in these five years-a life without excitement or privation oi toil-a life of moderation and regu- larity-of easy household; duties, and quiet family affections, hadrestored and preserved her maiden beauty. And now her pretty hair had its own will, and fell in slight, flossy black ringlets down each side the pearly brow and cheeks; and no- thing could have been more in keeping with the style of her beauty than the simple, close-fitting black gown, her habitual dress el But lovely-as the young mother was, you would scarely have looked at hera second time while she held that child by her hand--so marvelous was the fascination of that little crea- ture's countenance.

I might describe the fine dark Jewish features, the glorious eyes, the brilliant complexion, and the fall of long, glossy, black ringlets that veiled the proud little head; but the spell lay not in them, any more than in the perfect symmtery of her form, or the harmonious grace of her motion, or the melodious intona- tions of her voice. She wore a black dress like her mothers- Edith would have it so. And the color was in perfect harmony with the character of the little girl's countenance. For it might be hereditary temr perament, or peculiar individuality, or her mother's deep dis- tress just preceding and following her birth; either or all of these, but something gave to the child's splendid Syrian beauty a prevailing expression of impassioned melancholy. And-there; perhaps, lay the mystery of its spell. Edith, still leading the little girl, advanced:to Marian's side, where the latter stood at the yard gate. *' I heard a scream, Marian, dear,-what was it?" Marian pointed to the old elm tree outside the cottage fence, under the shade of which stood the poor stroller, pressing her side, and panting for breath. "Edith, do you see that young woman? She it was." "Good Heaven!" exclaimed Edith, turning a shade paler, and beginning, with trembling fingers, to unfasten the gate. "Why, do you know her, Edith?" "Yes I yes I My soul, it is Fanny Laurie I I thought she was in some asylum at the north P" said Edith, passing the gate, and going up to the wanderer.

Then, suddenly chnging her mood, she snatched Marian's palm, and gazed upon it long and intently; gradually her features hecame disturbed--dark shadows seemed to sweep, as a funered train, across her face-her bosom heaved-she dropped the maidens hand.  15'  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7871-00000086"/> 100$     THE    MSSING    BRIDE. "Why, Fanny, you have told me nothing HWhat do you see in my future?" asked Marian. The maniac looked up, and breaking, as she sometimes did, into improvisation, chanted, in the most'mournful of tones, these words: "Darkly, deadly, lowers the shadow, Quickly, thickly, comes the crowd-- From death's bosom creeps the adder, Trailing slime upon' the shroud!" Marian grew pale, so much, at the moment, was she infected with the words and manner of this sybil; but then, "Nonsense!" she thought, and, with a smile, roused herself to shake off the chill that was creeping upon her. "Feel! the air I the air!" said Fanny, lifting her hand. "Yes, it is going to rain," said Edith.  "Come in, dear Fanny."  But Fanny did not hear-the fitful, uncertain creature had seized the hand of the child Miriam, and was gazing alternately upon the lines in the palm and upon her fervid, eloquent face. "What is this? Oh I what is this?" she said, sweeping the black tresses back from her bending brow, and fastening her eyes upon Miriam's palm.  "'WhatA can it mean?  A  deep cross from the Mount of Venus crosses the line of life, and forks into the line of death! a great sun in the plait of Mars,--a cloud in the vale of Mercury I and where the lines of life and death meet, a sanguine spot and a great star I  I cannot read it! In a boy's hand, that would betoken a hero's career, and a glorious death in a victorious field; but in a girl's! What can it mean when found in a girl's? Stop!"  And she peered into the hand for a few moments in deep silence, and then her face lighted up, her eyes burned intensely, and once more she broke forth in im- provisation-- "Thou shalt be bless'd as maiden fair was never bless'd before And the heart of thy belov'd shall be most gentle, kind and pure But thy red hand shall be lifted at duty's stern behest, And give to fell destruction the head thou lov'st the best Peel I the airI the air!" she exclaimed, suddenly dropping the Child's hand, and lifting her own towards the sky. t.   *WANDERING FANNY.           187  "Yes, I told you it was going to rain, but there will not be much, only a light shower from the cloud just over our heads." "It is going to weep!

Marian and Edith looked after her, in the utmost compassion. "Who is the poor, dear creature, Edith, and what has reduced her to this state?" "She was an old playmate of my own, Marian. I never men- tioned her to you-I never could bear to do so. She was one of the victims of the war. She was the child of Colonel Fairlie and the bride of Henry Laurie, one of the most accomplished and promising young men in the state. In one night their house was attacked, and Fanny saw her father and her husband mas- sacred, and her home burned before her face I She-fell into the hands of the soldiers I She went mad from that night." "Most horrible 1!" ejaculated Marian. "She was sent to one of the best northern asylums, and the property she inherited was placMd in the hands of a trustee--old Mr. Hughles, who died last week, you know; and now that he is dead and she is out, I don't know what will be done, I don't understand it at all." "Has she no friends, no relatives? She must not be allowed to wander in this way," said the kind girl, with the tears swim- ming in her eyes. "I shall always be her friend, Marian. She has no others that, I know of now; and no relative, except her young cousin, Thurston Willcoxen, who has been abroad at a German Utniver- sity these five years past, and who,- in event of Fanny's death, would inherit her property. We must get her here, if possible. I will go in and send Jenny after her. She will probably over- take her in the forest, and may be able to persuade her to come back. At least, I shall tell Jenny, to keep her in sight, until she is in some place of safety."  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7871-00000087"/> 188     THE   MSSING  BRIDE. "Do, dear Edith!" "Are you not coming?" said Edith, as she led her little girl towards the house. "In one moment, dear; I wish only to bind up this morning- glory, that poor Fanny chanced to pull down as she ran through." Edith disappeared in the cottage. Marian stood with both her rosy arms raised, in the act of binding up the vine,that with its wealth of splendid azure- hued, vase-shaped flowers, over-canopied her beautiful head like a triumphal arch. She stood there, as I said, like the radiant, blooming goddess of life and health, summer sunlight and blush- ing flowers. The light tramp of horse feet fell upon her ear. She looked up, and with surprise lighting her dark-blue eyes, beheld a gen- tleman mounted on a fine black Arabian courser, that curvetted gracefully and capriciously before the cottage gate. Smilingly the gentleman soothed and subdued the coquettish mood of his willful steed, and then dismounted, and bowing with matchless grace and much deference, addressed Marian. The maiden was thinking that she had never seen a gentleman with a presence and a manner so graceful, courteous and princely in her life. He was a tall, finely proportioned, handsome man, with a superb head, an aquiline profile, and fair hair and fair complexion. The great charm, however, was in, the broad, sunny forehead, in the smile of ineffable sweetness, in the low and singularly mellifluous voice, and the manner, gentle and graceful as any woman's. "Pardon me, my name is Willcoxen, young lady, and I have the honor of addressing--?" "Miss Mayfield," said Marian. "Thank you," said the gentleman, with one involuntary gaze of enthusiastic admiration that called all the roses out in full bloom upon the maiden's cheeks; then governing himself, he bent his eyes to the ground, and said, with great deference- "(You will pardon the liberty I have taken in calling here, Miss MayfivdJ, when I tell you that Izam in search of an un-   WANDER-ING    FPANNY.       189. happy young relative, who, I am informed, passed here not long since." She left us not ten minutes ago, sir, much against our wishes. My sister has just sent a servant to the forest in search of her, to bring her back, if possible. Will you enter, and wait till she returns?" With a beaming smile and graceful bend, and in the same sweet tones, he thanked her, and declined the invitation. Then he remounted his horse, and bowing deeply, rode off in the direction Fanny had taken. And Marian remained at the gate-lost-looking after his retreating form. Once he turned his head, and seeing her still standing there, he bowed lowly, to the very pommel of his sad- dle, and then disappeared in the forest. And the roses upon the face of Marian were in their brightest bloom when she re-entered the cottage., The neat breakfast-table was standing in the middle of the floor, covered with its snow-white cloth, and adorned with its pure white service-the coffee-pot and the plate of rolls and the dish'of stewed oysters were still sit-, ting upon the hearth. And as Marian helped Edith to arrange these upon the table, the latter inquired, "Who was that speaking to you at the gate, Marian?" "Who but Mr. Willcoxen." "WhatI not Thurston Willcoxen I!" "The very same 1" "You astonish me I He returned 1" So it appea;rs 1" "Why, when did he get back?"          ' X "I am sure I do not knowl I He never volunteered to tell me, and I certainly was not at liberty to inquire." "Well, I am amazed   What was the object of his visit here?"  "He came in search of Fanny. He introduced himself by name, and inquired after her, and as soon as he received the necessary directions, he set out in pursuit of her, and that is all," said Marian, as she sat down to the table, and began to '          12 * '^  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7871-00000088"/> arrange the cups to pour out the coffee, for of this :ittle labor also the kind girl habitually relieved Edith. After a little silence, Edith said, "Thurston was a very handsome youth',when he left the country-how does he look now, Marian?"  "Well," said the young girl, hesitating and smiling, "I do not know how princes ought to look, or how they do look-no better, really, I suppose, than humbler men--yet I have but one word to convey my impression of this gentleman's appear- ance and address-both were--princely. I have seen no one like him in this neighborhood-no one with so fine an expres- sion, or so fascinating a manner-a manner, what shall I say- so full of suave and stately courtesy-of proud deference--in a word, Edith, I had the simplicity to gaze after the gentleman's retreating figure, thinking I had never seen any one ride so admirably, until he actually turned and bowed, at which I came in the house, a little flushed at having betrayed so much rusticity." While they were yet talking, Jenny  returned from  her errand-alone. "Did you see Mrs. Laurie?" asked Edith. "Who de debbel she, honey:? Oh I you 'fers to poor, dear, misfort'nate Miss Fanny I Yes, honey, I seen she," said Jenny, sitting down, and taking off her sun-bonnet, and making herself comfortable. "Yes, honey, I fell in 'long o' her, 'jes on de edge o' de wood.

Usually weeks would pass without any one passing to or from the cot- tage, except Marian, whose cheerful, kindly, social disposition was the sole connecting link between the cottage and the neighborhood around it.  But this day seemed to be ai exception. While yet the little party lingered at -the breakfast-table Edith looked up, and saw the tall', thin figure of a woman in a nankeen riding-shirt, and a nankeen corded sun-bonnet, in th( act of dismounting from her great, raw-boned, white horse. "If there isn't Miss Nancy Skamp!" exclaimed Edith, in no very hospitable tone--" and I wonder how she can leave the post-office." "Ohl this is not mail dayl" replied Marian, laughing, "notwithstanding which, we shall have news enough." And Marian who, for her part, was really glad to see the old lady, arose to meet and welcome her. Miss Nancy was little changed; the same tall, thin, narrow- chested, stooping figure--the same long, fair, freckled, sharp set face-the same prim cap, and clean, scant, fadey gown, or one of the same sort--made up her personal individuality. Miss Nancy now had charge of the village post-office; and her early and accurate information respecting all neighborhood affairs, was obtained, it was whispered, by an official breach of trust; if so, however, no creature except Miss Nancy, her black boy,  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7871-00000089"/> and her whitecat, knew it. She was a great news carrier, i is . and her white cat, knew it. She was a great news carrier, it is true, yet she was not especially addicted to scandal. To her, news was news, whether good or bad, and so she took almost as much pleasure in exciting the wonder of her listeners by' recounting the good action or good fortune of her neighbors as the reverse. And so after having dropped her riding-skirt, and given that and her bonnet to Marian to carry up stairs, and seated her- self in the chair that Edith offered her at the table, she said, sipping her coffee, and glancing between the white curtains - and the green vines of the open window out upon the bay, '"You have the sweetest place, and the finest sea view here, my dear Mrs. Shields I but that is not what I was a-going to say. JI was going to tell you that I hadn't hearn from you so long, that I thought I must take an airly ride this morning, and spend the day with you. And I thought y6u'd like to hear about your old partner at the dancing-school, young Mr. Thurs- ton Willcoxen, a-coming back-la, yes I. to be sure l]we had almost all of us forgotten him, leastwise I had. And then, Miss Marian," she said, as our blooming girl returned touher place at the table, I just thought I would bring over that mus- lin for the collars and caps, you were so good as to say you'd make for me." 1'"Yes, I am  glad you brought them, Miss Nancy," said Marian, in her cheerful tone, as she helped herself to another roll. "I hope you are not busy now, my dear." "Ohl I'm always busy, thank Heaven I but that makes no difference, Miss- Nancy; I shall find time to finish your work this week and next." "I am sure it is very good of you, Miss Marian, to sew for me for nothing; when-" "Oh, pray, don't speak of it, Miss Nancy." "But indeed, my dear, I must say I never saw anybody like youl if anybody's too old to sew, and too poor to put it out, it is 'Miss Marian' who will do it for kindness; and if any-   W A NDERING     FANNY.       193 body is sick, it is ' Miss Marian' who is sent for to nurse them; and if any poor negro, or ignorant white person, has friends off at a distance, they want to hear from, it is ' Miss Marian' who writes all their letters!" - "But, Miss Nancy, what of it? It is a real happiness to me I and I think it is right to find as well as to make all the happiness we can in this world." "But, my dear, I don't know how you have the time, I don't indeed. Your day must be forty-eight hours long, and your week fourteen days 1" Marian laughed. "We can always find time for a sacred duty, Miss Nancy, and I do think to nurse the sick, and sew for the old and blind, and to write for those who cannot write for themselves, are sa. cred duties." "Indeed I often try to remember what the neighborhood did- before you came into it, and I wonder what we should all do if you were to be taken away!" Marian laughed again.       - "I am not likely to be taken away, Miss Nancy, I expect to grow gray at Old Field Cottage, and if I were to die, or: depart, no doubt Heaven would provide you with a sub- stitute." "I don't know where one would be got then, I'm sure I! For I know everybody thinks there's not your equal to be found. And as for me, Miss Marian, I should really think you were a. saint if you didn't laugh so much." At this [Marian laughed more-laughed till the tears came- into her eyes, "Do eat your breakfast, Miss Nancy, and let me eat mine- for, if you will cofapliment me so much, I shall have to compli- ment back again, and then my coffee will get cold." Jenny, who stood at the fire, stewing fresh oysters, and listen- ing to the talk, now looked askant over her shoulder, and grumbled, inaudibly, "Why, in de inimy's name, don't de ole creeter let her wit-                Xo  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7871-00000090"/> THE MSSING BRIDE. tels stop her mouth; for ebery precious word as comes out'n it is 'cet. Keepin' de table stanin' in de middle o' de floor till nigh 'pon nine o'clock, an' me wid my work to do!" When they arose from breakfast, and the room was tidied up, and Edith, and Marian, and their guest, were seated at their work, with all the cottage windows open to admit the fresh and fragrant air, and the rural landscape on one side, and the sea view on the other, and while little Miriam sat at their feet dress- ing a nun doll, and old Jenny betook herself to the garden to gather vegetables for the day, Miss Nancy opened her budget, and gave them all the news of the month. But in that which concerned Thurston Willcoxen alone was Edith interested, and of him she learned the following facts: Of the five years which Mr. Willcoxen had been absent in the eastern hemisphere, three had been spent at the German University, where he graduated with the highest honors; eighteen months had been passed in travel through Europe, Asia, and Africa; and the last year had been spent in the best circles in the city of Paris. He had been back to his native place about three weeks; Since the death of Fanny Laurie's old guardian, the judge of the orphans' court had appointed him sole trustee of her property, and guardian of her person. As soon as he had received this power, he had gone to the asylum, where the poor creature was confined, and hearing her pronounced incurable, though harmless, he had set her at liberty, brought her home to his own house, and had hired a skillful, attentive nurse to wait upon her. "And you never saw such kindness and compassion, Miss Marian, except in yourself. I do declare to you, that his man- ner to that poor unfortunate, is as delicate and reverential and devoted as if she were the most accomplished and enviable lady in the land, and more so, Miss Marian, more so!" "I can well believe it! He looks like that 1" said the beau- tiful girl, her face flushing and her eyes filling with generous sympathy. But Marian was rather averse to sentimentality, so dashing the sparkling drops from her blushing cheeks, she looked up and said, "Miss Nancy, we are going to have   THE FOREST FAIRY.   chickens for dinner. How do you like them cooked?  It don't matter a bit to Edith and me." "Stewed then, if you please, Miss Marian! or stop-no-- 'think baked in a pie!" CHAPTER XV. THE  FOREST   F AI RY. "Leaping spirits light as air I Dancing heart untouched by care I Sparkling eye and laughing brow! And mirthful cheek of joyous glow!" ON the afternoon of the same day spent by Miss Nancy Skamp at Old Field Cottage; the family at Luckenough were assembled in that broad, central passage, their favorite resort in warm weather. Five years had made very little alteration here, excepting in the case of Jacquelina, who had grown up to be the most en- chanting sprite that ever bewitched the hearts, or turned the heads of men. She was petite, slight, agile, graceful; clustering curls of shining gold encircled a round, white forehead, laugh- ing in light; springs under springs of fun and frolic sparkled up from the bright, blue eyes, whose flashing light flew bird- like everywhere, but rested nowhere.  She seemed even less human and irresponsible than when a child-verily a being of the air, a fairy, without human thoughtfulness, or sympathy, or affections I She only seemed so-under all that fay-like levity  there was a heart. Poor heart! little food or cultivation ha]-py it had in all its life. For who had been Jacquelina's educators?  First, there was the Commodore, with his alternations of blustering wrath and foolish fondness, giving way to his anger,  ;s   to,s&#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7871-00000091"/> 196     TH E  MSSING     BRIDE. or indulging his love, without the slightest regard to the effect produced upon his young ward--too often abusing her for something really admirable in her nature-and full as frequently praising her for something proportionately reprehensible in her conduct. - Next, there was the dark, and solemn, and fanatical Dr. Grimshaw, her destined bridegroom, who really- and truly loved the -child to fatuity, and conscientiously did the very best he could for her mental and moral welfare, according to his light. Alas! I when the light that is in one is darkness, how great is that darkness 1"Jacquelina rewarded his serious efforts with laughter, and flattered him with the pet names of Hobgoblin, Ghoul, Gnome, Ogre, &amp;c. Yet she did not dislike her solemn suitor-she never had taken the matter so seriously as that! And he on his part bore the eccentricities of the elf with,.match- less patience, for he loved her, as I said, to fatuity-doted on her with a passion that increased with ripening years, and of late consumed him like a fever. And then there was her mother, last named because, what- ever she should have been, she. really was the least important of Jacquelina's teachers. Fear was the key-note of, Mrs. L'Oiseau's character-the key-stone in the arch of her religious faith-she feared everything--the opinion of the world, the un- faithfulness of friends, changes. in the weather,. reverses of for- tune, pain, sickness, sorrow, want, labor I All the evils of life were exaggerated and made imminent by that one principle in her character, and worse than all, poor creature, her soul was filled, not with the love of the Father, but with the fear of the Angry God  the Deus Iri of her tremendous dread! Her worldly wisdom was of the same character, governed by the same motives, fear and self-interest. "Whatever'you do, my "..-ear, you must please your uncle and Doctor Grimshaw-never nmifd your aunty-she hasn't much in her own right to leave to anybody, and she is wasting it all on Edith. But your uncle, my dear; -you must please your uncle, and win Dr. Grimshaw, too, for he never will leave you Luckenough, unless you are to "',' '    THE  FOREST   FAIRY.       197 be Dr. Grimshaw's wife, and if he don't, what should we do I Be homeless beggars for the rest of our lives!" Now the time had not yet come for .this proposed marriage to shock the merry maiden. She did not realize what was in- tended-the words were meaningless to her, worn out with con- stant use; she had heard them ever since she could remember, and she paid no attention to them; so to speak, 1'they went in at one ear and out at- the other." She was " ower young to marry yet." So thought not the Commodore i for a year past, since his niece had attained the age of fourteen, he had been worrying himself and the elders of the family to have the marriage so- ,lemnized, "before the little devil shall have time to get some other notion into her erratic head," he said. All were opposed to him, holding over his head the only rod he dreaded, the opinion of the world. "What would people say if you were to marry your niece of fourteen to a man of thirty-four?" they urged. "But, I tell you, young men are beginning to pay attention to her now, and I can't take her to church that some jackanapes don't come capering around her, and the minx will get some whim in her head like Edith did, I know she will I Just see how Edith disappointed me I ungrateful huzzy I after my bring- ing her up and educating her, for her to do sol While, if she had married Grim' when I wanted her to do it, by this time I'd have had my grandchil-! I mean nieces and nephews climb- ing about my knees.  But by-- I I wont be frustrated this time i" And so Jacquelina was kept more secluded than ever. Se- cluded from society, but not from nature. The forest became her haunt. And a chance traveler passing through it, and meeting her fay-like form, might well suppose he, was deceived with the vision of a wood-nymph. The effervescent spirits of the elf had to expend themselves in the same-way. As a child'she had ever bben as remarkable for surprising feats of agility as for fun, frolic, mischief, and 16,  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7871-00000092"/> 198     THE   MSSING   BRIDE. diablerie. And every one of these traits augmented with her growth. Feats of agility became a passion with her-her airy spirit seemed only to find its full freedom in rapid motion, in daring flights, in difficult achievements, and in hair-breadth 'scapes. Everything that she read of in that way, which could possibly be imitated, was attempted. She had her bows and arrows, and by original fitness, as well as by constant practice. she became an excellent markswoman-she had her well-trained horse, and her vaulting bars, and made nothing of flying over a high fence or a wide ditch. But her last whim was the most eccentric of all. She had her lance. And her favorite pastime was to have a small ring suspended from a cross beam, and while riding at full speed, with her light lance balanced in her hand, to catch this ring and bear it off upon the point of that lance. In feats of agility alone she excelled, not in those of strength-that airy, fragile form was well fitted for swiftness and sureness of motion, yet not for muscular force. Her uncle and Grim' indulged her in all these frolics-her uncle in great delight-Grim-', under the protest, that they were unworthy of an immortal being with eternity to prepare for. In these five past years, Cloudesley had been home once- namely, at the end of the stated three years. He had been re- ceieved with unbounded joy by his child-friend; had brought her the out-grown suit of uniform; had spent several months at Luckenough, and renewed his old delightful intimacy with its little heiress presumptive, and at length had gone to sea again for another three years' voyage. And it must be confessed that Jacquelina had found the second parting more grievous than the first. And this time Cloudesley had fully shared her sor- row. He had been absent a year, when, upon this evening, we find the family assembled in the spacious passage. I said that with the exception of Jacquelina, little change had passed over the members of the household. Mary L'Oiseau was almost precisely the same. Mrs. Waugh had increased in flesh to such a degree as made it rather heavy work for her to go up and down stairs, a task only to be accomplished with much panting and blowingf   T I E FORiEST    A I RY.     199 The Commodore was very much the same in aspect as when first presented to the reader. But he was' suffering from the gout, that frequently confined him to his room. And this afflic- tion, so far from disciplining his?: character or improving his temper, made him twice the tyrant that he was before. And Henrietta, really affected by his sufferings, not only never her- self crossed his humor, but never permitted any one else to do so. She compelled them to submit with--"Remember your master's suffering leg, you thoughtless wretdhes youl" to the house servants.' And to Jacquelina, "OhI my love just re. member your poor uncle's poor, dear leg, and put up with his little ways!" His little ways! I will tell you what they were I! -one of his little ways was-when confined to his room-to pound upon the floor, with his crutch, until three or four ser- vants all started to run to him at once-notwithstanding the imminent danger of having the said crutch hurled at their heads as soon as they should appear at his door, or laid vigorously over their backs as soon as they should-get within arm's length of him, for it was impossible to know exactly who was wanted, and if the right one did not come " woe betide him" when he did. Never had that leg, in the days that in company with its fellow limb, it had stamped up and down the hall, kicking the' men and boys, and propelling the dogs and cats through the door, and making the old beams and sleepers tremble with sym- pathetic fear--been so much the dread of delinquents at now that it was swathed in bandages, and laid up on, pillows. That leg was a sort of marshal's baton held up in terrorem over the whole family-a sceptre: of iron, before whichl all must bend. Until finally Jacquelina got very tired of the bother, rebelled,; and vowed that she, for one, was .not going to bel walked over by her uncle's leg any longer! there I On this especial evening, the old sailor was so much better as to be able to come down into the hall and lie upon the. settee, that before-mentioned green, wooden settee that stood; against the wall in a line with the foot of the stairs.

They were discussing the one exciting topic of the neighborhood, the return of Thurston Willcoxen. "If he had been guided by me," said the Commodore, "he never would have gone into foreign parts first. I think Ame- rica, the United States and territories of North America, quite extensive enough for any young man's ambition 1" "Was it extensive enough for yours, uncle, when you went away for twenty years?" "Hush, Magpie I You never open your lips'that some sauce don't come out of them!" "Sauce-piquante, uncle?" ( No, Minx I that goes in fast enough in company with rock- fish!" "Now, I leave it to any one who knows me if I am a gour- mand! At least I have not gout enough to get the gout i" "Where is my crutch? or the boot jack? Is there nothing to throw at her?"

They lingered long in the hall that evening, longer than usual. Was it with any prophetic feeling that this would be the very last evening they would ever sit in that old passage way again? That very night the old mansion, that had withstood the  storms of more than two hundred winters, was burned to the  ground 1 The fire broke out in the kitchen. Upon that fatal evening  it had been left to Stupid to cover up the brands on the kitchen hearth. No one could surmise how he contrived to draw on the calamity. It is true that Maria, who was waiting on her master at his bedside, had mockingly told "Stupe" to be sure and leave a coal sticking to the broom when he swept the ashes up.. But could Stupe have been such a fool as to take her at her word? Maria was not certain, and upon the whole, she thought it best not to investigate the matter'too closely. For indeed, Stupe had become most lamentably stupid since his master's accession of illness and ill-temper had kept him in a state of perpetual panic, in fact since the reign of the leg had commenced. Be that as it may, upon the evening of the fire, Jacquelina bad gone to her room-she had an apartment to herself now- mnd feeling for the first time in ,her life, some little uneasiness ibout her uncle's "whim" of wedding her to Grim', she had walked about the floor for sometime in much restlessness of nind and body; then she went to a wardrobe, and took out Cloudy's treasured first uniform, and held it up before her. Bow small it looked now; why it was scarcely too large for herselfl And how much Cloudy had outgrown it!  It had itted him nicely at sixteen, now he was twenty-one, and in two years more he would be. home again! Smiling to herself, and bossing her charming head, as at some invisible foe, she said, "Yes, indeed! II should so like to see them do it!"    THE  FOREST   FAIRY.      20&amp; She pressed the 'cloth up to her face, and put it away,and, 9still smiling to herself, retired to' rest, to dream of her dear playmate. She dreamed of being in his ship on the open sea, the scene idealized to supernal beauty and sublimity, as all such scenes are in dreams; and then she thought the ship took fire, and saw, and heard, and felt the great panic and horror that ensued. She woke in a terrible fright. A part of her dream was true I Her chamber was filled with smoke, aid the house was chaotic with noise and confusion, and resounded with cries of "' Fire l Fire l' everywhere. What happened next passed with the swiftness of lightning. She jumped out of bed, seized a wool- len shawl, and wrapped it' around her head, and even in that imminent danger not forgetting her mo st cherished treasure, Cloudy's suit of uniform, snatched it from the wardrobe- and fled out of the room.. Her swift and dipping motion that had gained her the name of "Lapwing," now served her well-. shooting her bright head forward and downward, she fled through all the passages, and down all the' stairs, and out by the great hall, that was all in flames, until she reached the lawn, where the panic-stficken and nearly idiotic household were as- sembled, weeping, moaning and wringing their hands, while they gazed upon the work of destruction before them in im- potent despair! Jacquelina looked all: around upon the group, each figure of which glared redly in the light of the flames. All were present -all but the Commodore! Where could the Commodore be? Jacquelina ran through the crowd looking for him in all di- rections. He was nowhere visible, though the whole area was lighted up, even to the edge of the forest, every tree and branch and twig and leaf of which was distinctly revealed in the strong red glare.        - "Where is uncle? Oh! where is uncle?" she exclaimed, running wildly about, and finally going up to Mrs. Waugh,  who, in her nightclothes, stood looking the statue of con- sternation!  13 A  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7871-00000096"/> ,VO      T i.., MSS IN, ,   D J tJ., Jacquelin&amp; shook her fat arm.

It was too late Commodore Waugh was in the burning mansion, in his bedchamber, near the top of the, house, fast asleep I "Good heaven! wjll no one attempt to save him?"' screamed Henrietta, running wildly from one to the other.  They all gazed on each other, and then in consternation upon the burning; building,. every window of which was belching flame, while the sound of. some falling rafter, or, the explosion of, some combustible substance was continually heard I To venture into that blazing house, with its sinking roof and falling rafters, seemed certain death. "Oh t my God I my God!l will none even try to save him,?" cried Henrietta, wringing her hands in extreme anguish. Suddenly- "Pray for me, aunty!" exclaimed Jacquelina, and she darted like a bird towards the house, into the .passage, and, seemed lost in the smoke and flame  Wrapping the woollen shawl closely about her, and keeping neax the floor, she glided swiftly up the stairs, flight after, flight, and, through the, suffocating passages until she 'reached her uncle's door; it was open, and his room was clearer of smoke than  y any, other, from the wind blowing through the, open Wj'doww.

This effectually brought him to his senses; he understood everything 1 he leaped from the bed, seized a-blanket, envel- oped her in it, raised her in his arms, and forgetting gout, lameness, leg and all, bore'her down the creaking, heated stairs, flight after flight, and through the burning passages out of the house, in safety. Oh, surely the angels had held up that sinking roof, that, as soon as they had passed in safety, fell with an awful resonance, sending up new flames to Heaven, bearing, as it were, the story of the young girl's heroism. A shout of joy greeted the Commodore, as he appeared with Jacquelina in the yard. But heeding nothing but the burden he bore in his arms, the old sailor strode on until he reached a convenient spot, where he threw the blanket off her face to give her air. She had fainted-the terror and excitement had been too great-the reaction was too powerful-it had overwhelmed her, and she lay insensible across his arms, her fair head hanging back, her white garments streaming in the air, her golden locks floating, her witching eyes closed, and her blue lips apart, and rigid on her glistening teeth-so she lay like dead Cordelia in the arms of old Lear. Henrietta and Mrs. L'Oiseau, followed by all the household, crowded around them, with water, the only restorative at hand. At- length she recovered and looked up, a little bewildered, but soon memory and understanding returned, and gazing at her uncle, she suddenly threw her arms around his neck, and burst into tears. She was then carried away into one of the best negro quar- ters, and laid upon a bed, and attended by her mother and her maid Maria. The Commodore, with his wife, found shelter in another quar- ter. And the few remaining members of the household were accommodated in a similar manner elsewhere.  They had scarcely got within doors when the storm, that had been muttering in the distance all the forepart of the night,   THE   FOREST   FAIRY.       209 now burst upon the earth. The rain came down in torrents, like another deluge, and continued with unabated violence until morning. The sun arose upon a strange, wild scene-a scene of beauty and of desolation I There was the greensward and shrubber ries, and the surrounding belt of forest, all verdant and spangled with rain-drops, and sparkling in the fresh light of morning- and there, in the midst, was the ruin, with its blackened walls and chimneys I The fire had been effectually extinguished by the floods of rain, but not until it had completed the work of destruction. Nothing had been saved but the clothing in which the family stood. Something doubtless might have been secured from the flames had there been an organized action, or a leader, with presence of mind enough left to direct the crowd, who, panic- stricken by the suddenness, and the unprecedented nature of the catastrophe, had remained totally inactive. The loss, complete as it was in regard to Luckenough, was not, however, very great; the house and the furniture were old, and might be considered to owe no farther service to their pro- prietor. For years there had been a talk of pulling down and rebuilding and refurnishing. The long deferred and doubtful matter was now precipitated and rendered certain. That was all. After a rude breakfast, the best that could be prepared under the circumstances, a family council was--called, and it was decided that they should go to B   for the present, until some other course was fixed upon, especially as Jacquelina was very ill and needed immediate medical attendance. The stables had not been burned, and the carriage and horses were safe. Festus and Bill were directed to bring themf around, while Maria, mounted on a mule, was despatched to the nearest neighbor to borrow, clothing for the burnt-out family. It was near noon before they were all ready to set forth from the scene of disaster, and it was the middle of the afternoon when they found themselves temporarily settled at the little hotel.  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7871-00000098"/> 210     THE  MSS:I'N    B RIDE. at Benedict, in the very apartments formerly occupied by Edith and Marian. Here Jacquelina suffered a long and severe spell of illness, during which her- bright: hair was cut off. And here beautiful iMarian came, with!her gift of tender nursing, and devoted herself day and night to the:service of the young invalid. And all the leisure time she found while sitting by:the sick bed she busily employed in making up clothing for. the almost denudei family: And neverhad the dear girl's nimble fingers flown so fast or so willingly. Every day the Commodore, accompanied by Dr. Grimshaw, rode over to Luckenough to superintend the labors of the workmen in pulling down and clearing away the ruins of the. old mansion, and preparing the site for a new building.

During her illness, Jacquelina had become -passionately at- tached to Marian, as all persons did who came under the daily in- fluence of the beautiful girl. Dr. Grimshaw was to accompany the family to Bentley. Jacquelina insisted that Marian should be asked to make one of the party. Accordingly, the Commo- dore and Mrs. Waugh, nothing loth, invited and pressed the kind maiden to go with them. But for many reasons Marian declined the journey--first, she could not or would not leave Edith, -except upon missions of - benevolence or necessity- secondly, now that her services were no longer needed, she did not wish'to accept the hospitality of the uncle from whom -her sister was still estranged; and, lastly, had neither of these great reasons existed, a smaller one equally cogent would have pre- vented her becoming one of the party, namely--Marian had no proper wardrobe for the occasion. Two or three coarse, light- blue ginghams, and lilac calicoes, and one white dress, con. stitated -Marians summer outfit.

Therefore, when her duties as nurse and seamstress were over Marian rejoined Edith. And Commodore Waugh, with his wife, his niece, and his Grim', set out in the family carriage for Bentley Springs. (CHAPTER XVl. o THE  MOCK-TOURNAMENT. The lovely stranger stands confessed A maid in all her charms a"-Goldsmitfh. IT was Jacquelina's first visit to a watering place, and it might be said to be her first entrance into society. Her health rapidly improved, and she gave herself up to pleasure with all the en- thusiasm of a novice. None so gay as she I Her hair had not been cut so close but that it would curl and cluster in little golden rings around her laughing forehead--giving new piquancy to the fairy face. She was the newest beauty there. Near the last of the season, there was a project started that enlisted all Jacquelina's interest-this was a mock-tournament, to be followed by a masked ball. She entered into the spirit of the thing with all her heart and soul, as usual. Indeed, it was believed by those who had good opportunities of judging, that the fairy herself was the invisible inspirer and instigator of the whole affair; that she dropped a hint here, and a hint there, in the proper quarters, where her suggestions would :fall like sparks of fire on combustible material, until the whole company at the Springs were a-blaze with excitement upon the subject of the mock-tournament.

An agent was procured and dispatched to the city, with writ- ten directions to select materials for the fancy dresses, mock armor, etc. Everybody knew,/of course, that it was going to be a-burlesque, and expected and prepared for nothing else. I must pass over the bustle of the preparations that occupied two weeks, and the accession of company from the neighboring towns and villages and the country round about, that poured into Bentley to see the wonder of the mock-tournament-the actors in which knew perfectly well that-they were making fools of themselves, but they did so with purpose, "prepense and aforethought," and no less zealously upon that account. The great day of the tournament came at last. I suppose it is necessary to give some idea of the scene in which the splendid spectacle of the tenth century was revived and travestied in the nineteenth. The hour was fixed for noon. The site was well selected. Imagine an open plain, ending at the south with a high, steep cliff, crowned with a forest, which at noon cast a long, dense shadow. Under the shade of this cliff were erected the seats of the spectators, wooden benches, raised one above the otefr, backwards. Here, at an early hour, were assembled and seated the greater number of the visitors of the Springs-that is to say, all the ladies :and children, and such of the gentlemen as did not take active part in the burlesque. Opposite these seats, at the extreme north of the plain, under a  canopy, the King-at-Arms, with heralds and pursuivants, in costume, held his cour.    THE   MOCK-TOURNAMENT.        213 At the east end was the gate through which the "knights"  entered -here were also stationed heralds and pursuivants in fancy dresses. Opposite, at the west extremity, was the gate through which they (the knights) issued, and here were stationed the "minstrels," -that is to say, a modern band of music-silent now, but to strike up a triumphant peal at the pass of every victorious knight. Now, if you fancy that this mock-tournament is to be an en- counter of gallant knights with shield and lance, I am sorry to disappoint you. We cannot even so much as travestie those things now. Few men now would like, even in sport, to meet an opponent in such thunder-shocks I No I It was an encoun- ter only of lance and ring-a feat of agility-an exhibition of sleight-of-hand, quickness and sureness of eye, and skillful and elegant horsemanship--no more. And -now take notice-a well rolled gravel-road was made to traverse the plain from the east gate, at which the knights were to enter to the west gate, from which they were finally to issue. Midway across this road stood what looked precisely like a gibbet, with a noose hanging down. Don't be shocked how- ever 1 For it was a much more merry matter. That was a rope certainly that hung down midway from the cross-beam-- and at the end of that rope was a small steel hook, with its point towards the west. - Upon that hook hung an iron ring of four inches in diameter. Now the feat to be accomplished was this -for the rider, while in full gallop, to bear off the ring on the, point of his lance. Among the spectators were of course our rustic family from Luckenough--the Commodore, Mrs. Waugh, Mrs. L'Oiseau, and Dr. Grimshaw-all except JacquelinaI and all taking the greatest interest in the scene about to be performed. Poor Jacquelina! Unlucky Sans Souci I It really seemed a very great pity, after all the zeal she had displayed in the get- ting up of this frolic-that on the very morning of its enactment, she should be seized with-oh-l such a maddenifig nervous head-  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7871-00000100"/> '21i4     TI'E 'MS IN Q    BRIDE. ache! At headache that "ached" so dreadfully, she could not hear a ray of light or the sound of;a footfall-a headache that ' nothing but utter darkness and silence and profound rest could mitigate. She vowed that she was sure, if she heard any one within ten feet of her room-door, she should fall into fits. And so she had every window-shutter closed, and sent Grim', and the Commodore, and her mother, and her aunty, and the maid Maria, all in turn, out of her room-protesting that if she was not left alone, she should go into convulsions! But if only permitted to go quietly to sleep, she should be better in the afternoon. And so, at her urgent desire, she was left alone in the dark room, with a lump of ice at her head, and mustard-plasters on the soles of her feet. Everybody pitied Miss L'Oiseau, but soon forgot her in the excitement of the coming scene. "Poor. Lapwing I how unfortunate that she should be sick this day of all days," said Mrs. Waugh, " but she seemed right well content, too, and doubtless she will be much better this afternoon, and be able to assist at the fancy ball," added the lady, comforting herself that she might the better enjoy the scene about to commence. - A   herald in a blue tunic blew his trumpet at the northern extremity of the area, proclaiming the lists open, and the tour- nament about to commence.  At the east gate, another herald, in a yellow tunic, repeated the proclamation. And at the west, another in red reiterated it. These officials were termed by the uninitiated crowd, "the red boy," "the yellow boy," and " the blue boy!"A  goodly number of competitors, in fancy dresses and mock armor, were congregated at the eastern gate. The "blue boy," in a sonorous voice, proclaimed their names and titles. The characters assumed for the occasion were-alas for modesty and veneration Hthe very greatest heroes of the middle ages; among them, "'Richard Coeur-de-Lion," the "Black Prince," "Harry, of England," (Henry V.) "Hotspur," "Sil William Wallace," etc. There were also some of a more comic character, -(it was all comic enough,) there were Don Quixote   T H:E M O:C K - T O U R N A M E N T.   -!15 and Sancho Panza, Sir tHudibras, etc. But the name of the first competitor was about to be proclaimed, and a deadsilence ensued.   '  "The Knight of Malta!" shouted the herald from -the north, whose voice was, unluckily, very-thick. "The Knight of the Altar!" repeated the east herald, whose ears were no better than the other's voice, and, "The Knight of the--.HALTER!" vociferated the west herald, who was too far off to hear well. "Oh I that is too funny I Poor Lapwing I How she would enjoy that 1!" said Mrs. Waugh. But just then the Knight of the "Halter" dashed forward on the road, with his lance balanced lightly in his right hand- and without pausing or slackening his speed in the least, sped through the area, and bore off the ring I The band of music struck up a triumphal air, and the spectators gave a shout of -congratulation. The successful aspirant turned and rode: around the area, and fell into his place. And the-ring was restored :to its station. And then the name of another candidate was proclaimed 'it turn-by the three heralds, and he rode forward. This was a splendid equestrian-but alas, as he sped through the course,- he only touched, and did not carry off the ring; and the imusic kept a dead silence, while he rode back crest-fallen, with: -his lance trailing by the saddle-bow. Then came a third candidate, who also missed; and ihen a fourth, who carried off the ring; and a fifth and a sixth, who failed even to'touch it; and a seventh and eighth, who bore lit off in triumph. And. thus, with more or less success, all the candidates who had failed were ruled out from the list of com- petitors, while those who had succeeded remained for a second trial of skill.  There were but nine competitors in the second conrse. And this passed off with the like success as the first--that is to say, less than one-half the candidates succeeded., Five failed, and  had their names stricken off the list. Four remained to try the  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7871-00000101"/> 216     THE  MS SIN G  B I D E. third course. These were "The Black 'Prince," "Hotspur," "Don Quixote De La Mancha," and "The Knight of Malta," alias of the "Halter." With the narrowing down of the number of competitors, the excitement of the actors, 'as well as of the spectators, arose. Oa the part of the rivals there was of course more fatigue, and less steady coolness than before. Perhaps it was upon this account, that in riding the third course; three of the competitors'fTailed, while only one, "The Knight of Malta," succeeded, thus re- maining, as he and every one else supposed, sole victor of the field I Not as they knew of, however!"There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip," and " oft expectation fails, and most oft there where most it promises." For while the victor knight, bearing aloft the ring upon the point of his lance, was careering around the field, and the ladies were waving handkerchiefs and casting bouquets in his way, and while the triumphant music was pealing, and the crowd was shouting, and the trum- pets blowing, and the heralds vociferating, and the "i King-at- Arms" preparing to- proclaim, through his marshals, that the renowned "Knight of Malta" was the victor of the day, and entitled to the honor of crowning the lady of his fealty Queen of Beauty and Love--hark! the winding of a horn, whose piercing notes penetrated through all grosser sounds, and an- nounced the advent of a new challenger I And lo 1 at the west gate, a vision of dazzling splendor! Sun and stars and diamonds, how radiant I It was a young knight, a mere stripling, in what seemed silver. plated scale armor, that glanced and flashed in the sunlight with blinding radiance--his helmet was encircled by a diadem of what seemed precious stones-diamonds, rubies, and emeralds, that sparkled, glowed, and blazed in rays of many colored fire, crested with a snow white plume-his steed was- white, with housings -of white satin, wrought with a deep border of silver lilies, and finished with a deep fringe of silver threads. Light, graceful, Serial, and dazzlingly radiant, was this resplendent vision I All the   21T T  E MOCK-TOURNA    XMENT.      21 crowd arose to look, and then turned their half blinded eyes away. A herald from the ing-at-Arms demanded his name, lineage, and country.  "PRINCE ARIEL, from the Court of-Fairy." His errand at- the tournament? 'To challenge the victor knight to a trial of a dozen, roundslI This was very trying indeed, just in the moment of victory. But by all the gallant and generous usages of chivalry, this challenge must not be refused--besides, the Fairy Prince was such a'mere sprite-not likely to conquer in materal contests. The assembly also, by acclamation, demanded that the challenge should be accepted. And it was accepted. Order was restored. Lots were drawn for the first trial, which fell on the fortunate Knight of Malta.              c Once more, with lance balanced in his right hand, the knight spurred on his charger towards the arch, and passed under it, carrying off the ring. And while he rode round the area, the crowd shouted, and the: music pealed forth as before. It was now the turn of the Fairy Prince. He was stationed at the west gate. With a swift, smooth, wavy motion, he gal-. loped on, his silver armor glancing in the sun rays, passed under the arch, and carried off the ring.- And themusic struck up, the crowd applauded, etc.              , The Knight of Malta's turn. He dashed on, with lance held as before, and passed under the arch, bearing off the ring, amid the usual peals and plaudits. And then again the Fairy Prince. He sped forward, like arrow to its aim, swept through the arch, and bore off the prize, amid the acclamations of the impartial multidude, and the thunders of the music.             . So far the success 'was equal, although the Fairy Prince far surpassed the Knight in elegance, and aerial grace of carriage. And this equality of success continued for several more rounds. At length, however, the Prince seemed to wish to bring the contest to a crisis. And when his turn came round, instead  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7871-00000102"/> A,-,     .*J . a - AX J I J I '1 JL, W. D 'I Jt L JL U ,/ of sweeping onward like a flash of lightning, as he had done before, he set forward in a gentle amble, -until he got within a few feet of the arch, when he backed his horse for a flying leap, aimed his lance, and vaulted through, carrying off the ring upon the point, and falling again into the gentle amble, finished the course; then turning on his road, he rode back, and in - the act of vaulting through the arch, replaced the ring upon the hook, amid deafening thunders of applause. This was a feat that had not been attempted before. The Knight of Malta, thus tacitly challenged to rival this skill, de- clined the attempt, and in all knightly courtesy yielded the palm to Fairy Prince as Victor of the Day. The excitement of the crowd was unprecedented. Every man was up on his feet: Every lady was waving her handkerchief. The band of music went mad, and raved away in a perfect storm of triumph. The heralds nearly split their throats blow- ing the trumpets. And the King-at-Arms, and all his marshals, vociferated themselves hoarse, in trying to " conquer a peace.," At length, however, silence was restored. And then- "Prince Ariel, of Fairyland," was pronounced victor of the day, and entitled to the honor of crowning his liege lady Queen of Beauty and Love. But who was the radiant Prince Areel and who was the lady of his choice? That was the question that excited to the utmost the interest of the breathless assembly.   . He had received the crown from the Kingtat-Armq, and was, about to indicate his queen by the act of coronation I What lady would she be? He now rode around the area, bearing the crown in his hand, and, approaching the seats of the spectatorsi paced along be- neath them, his snow-white charger prancing in its spangled white housings, his silver armor flashing in the sun, his diadem of precious stones burning like a circlet of fire around his hel- met, his snow-white plume dancing above his' closed vizor. -Oh, who was the dazzling Fairy Prince? Reader, have you- ever doubted his identity for a single moment?   THE   MOCK-TOtRNAMENT.         21i But lo I he has paused before a group among the spectators.

And the rest of the party wait in breathless expectancy I They have a faint impression that the victor is in search of Jacquelina. The Fairy Prince now bows before the group, until the snow- white crest sweeps the snow-white housings of the steed,; and; placing the crown upon the point of his lance, he raises it and ?. lays it at the feet of--THE COMMODORE. A shout of laughter rends the air I The veterans blushed black with embarrassment, shame and anger, at what- he; coln- siders an attempt to turn him into ridicule. But the multitude shout-"Take up the offering, gallant Commodore!

"Now is it not a pity such a merry girl as I, Should be sent to a nunnery to pine away and die?i' THE mock-tournament had broken up in disorder-the com- pany gathering into knots to discuss this last eccentricity of Miss L'Oiseau, or dispersing to laugh at it in their own apart- ments. The Commodore, with a grip of Jacquelina's shoulder, sent her along before him and his party, until they reached their own private parlor.  "And now you--what shall I call you? What shall I say to you? Was ever a man so bedeviled as I am 1" he exclaimed standing her before him. "Have patience, uncle I 'Patience, and smoke your pipe 1'" "I'll be shot if I do! Where did you get that masquerading dress, you little minx?" "I ran you in debt for it, uncle I It cost only three hundred dollars." "Three hun  WHAT?'

The Commodore trotted up and down, making short, impa- tient turns in the narrow room, like a chafed old lion in his cage, and grunting. "Ugh I ugh I ugh I She crushes me I She presses me I  feel like a lemon between the squeezers, with every drop of (220)   THE   SPRITE  IN  THE  CONVENT.    221 blood starting from every pore of my skin.

"Ha, ha, ha I be comforted, uncle I Since you are so stingy, let me tell you that your niece's fancy dress cost you next to nothing. The agent hired it for her from a pantomime com- pany!" The Commodore uttered a cry, and dropped down into a chair as if he had been shot. He was really shocked. "All the fiends alive! Henrietta, do you hear that!

A"Yes I didn't I do it beautifully, uncle? Aint you proud of me now? Aint I an honor to you?" "'You're a-catastrophe I Get out of my sight! Begone! And don't let me see you again for-a week!" Jacquelina laughed, and started, her mock armor jingling like silver' bells as she went. When the door closed after her a family council was held. Henrietta sat there, taking thiflgs as quietly as she usually took them. But Mary L'Oiseau was pale with surprise, dismay, and dread,- until the Commodore, turning to her, said, "Well, madam I What do you' think I shall have to do with this precious girl of yours?" "I'm sure I don't know," said the timorous creature, be- ginning to weep. "I always knew it would turn out just so 1" "Just how?"  "I always knew Jacquelina would give you offence, and then --and then--"               - "Well, and then-what? Can't you speak, Mary?" But Mary was weeping. "I ask you what you think had best be done with her." Oh I I'm sure I don't know I I can't defend her! You must do exactly as you think fit! I shan't interfere!" "No matter what I decide to do with her?" "No, indeedl for I'm perfectly-weary and worn out with contending with her follies." "Well, then, I'll marry her to Grim--right off!" "Oh, no I not that 1 She is but fifteen! she is too young I Besides, she wouldn't consent now!

"To a convent4school-I never thought of that before--let me see now--yes I think that will do-the life is yvery se- cluded, and the discipline very strict. Yes I that is very good. She shall go and stay a year, and then she shall come out and marry Grim'. That is excellent I ReallyMary, when you're put to it you have got more sense than anybody would think l I'll go and talk to Grim' about it " "  And, leaving the two ladies alone, the Commodore went in quest of Doctor Grimshaw, whom, 'after a, long search, he found walking-up and down a secluded avenue of the lawn in much disturbance of mind, Perhaps of all her friends who had been. present at the mock tournament, Doctor Grimshaw had been the most severely shocked and scandalized by the feats of his betrothed. Yet now that the Commodore addressed him, and, walking up and down with him, explained his plans in regard to, Jacquelina, Grim' shook his head. He did not like to part with his favorite-did not know what they should do without her at home, and did not believe it safe to send her :'to a nunnery, "Do you know the partridge never can be tamed, and dies it, it is caged? My fairy love is like the partridge. If she is put in the convent she will drive the sisters mad, or break her own heart. Don't send her away. Wait till we :are married. I aam sure I can reform her, and make her happy also." "Yesl but I tell you," said the Commodore, "that unless you consent to part with her for a time, you may never;marry her! Where we are going to live it will be impossible to separate her from young people of her own age, even from' Thurston Willcoxen, and what would you think now if I should tell you that already her -fancy has been touched by that young man from merely seeing him at church '?" Doctor -Grimshaw started and changed color--jealousy had entered his heart for the first tim6e-jealousy of the Uelgant Thurston Willcoxen.  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7871-00000105"/> 224     TH E  MSSING    BRIDE. "He must not be permitted to form her acquaintance I iHe must not be permitted to enter the house where she lives!" "I should like to know how that's to be prevented while we are boarding, unless I send her to school as I purposed." ... i Something else must be thought of. I cannot lose her so- ciety. And I cannot consent that she shall suffer constraint. We must find some other plan." While Doctor Grimshaw was thus pleading the cause of his selfish love, a waiter approached and -handed him a little tri- angular note. His sallow face flushed when he saw that it was from Jacquelina. It contained the following flattering pro- position: That-as her mother and her aunty had declined being present at the fancy ball of that evening, and had de- termined that she should not appear unless escorted by Doctor Grimshaw-therefore she had decided upon taking a character which would afford him a fitting opportunity of attending her in costume-she should appear as Beauty in the fairy tale of "Beauty and the Beast." Would he therefore please to come as the Beast? She had selected this, she said, in consideration iof his convenience, because it would require so little modifica- tion of his usual appearance and manner. If he did not like that, however-would he be Vulcan to her Venus? She offered him the choice; she only wished to please him, she was sure. Dr. Grimshaw was not unaccustomed to this style of com- pliment from the highly provoked. and equally provoking fairy. And previous to this day he had received her witty jibes and taunts and sarcasms with a patience and philosophy which was not without some natural dignity, as if he had felt that a man of his years and learning, and highly respectable standing in church and state, must not suffer himself to be disturbed by the quaint petulance of an elf.- But now his bosom was vulnerable, for his heart was sore with new-felt jealousy-jealousy 'f the all-praised Thurston Willcoxen m And he felt her shafts keenly. At any time before this, he would have borne his suffering in silence; now, stung by jealousy, he cried out bitterly-   TH'E   SPRITE  IN   THE  CONVENT.   225 "Yes I Beastl Vulcan  Ogre  Afritl Gnome!

What the furies are you driving at?" exclaimed the- Commodore, with his great round eyes staring with all their might at his excited companion. At another time, Dr. Grimshaw would have concealed the tricks of his elfish love, and so shielded her from her uncle's wrath. But jealousy is as mean and spiteful in some stages, as it is terrible and remorseless in others. It is said to be "as cruel as the grave ;" it is also loathsome as the worm that battens therein. He passed Jacquelina's little squib of a note to'the Commodore, where it acted like a lighted match thrown into a barrel of gunpowder. The old soldier exploded into fury; -abusing the poor fairy without measure, calling her names that would never bear repetition here, and swearing horribly profane oaths that he would send her to the nunnery, where she should remain until she knew how to behave herself. And as to the fancy ball of that night, she should not appear at it at all, in any character or under any escort whatever. She should, oin  the contrary, keep her own chamber, where she would have leisure to repent of her wickedness, he reckoned. -But for the Commodore to reckon without Jacquelina in anything that materially concerned herself, was not safe.! It is true he put his threat in execution-and locked the poor elf up in her room, and took away the key, lest some one- should release her. But Jacquelina laughed at his cunning, and with the point of her scissors, inserted between the lock and the catch, easily turned back the bolt and set herself at liberty., And that evening, in the midst of the fancy ball, when every- body had seen everybody else, and curiosity was satisfied, and the excitement apparently over, a great sensation was created by the sudden rising of a new star, who was announced as the  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7871-00000106"/> 226     THE   M;; I J?   BRIDE. Elfin Princess Maligna--who never unmasked, but in the course of the evening contrived to set more people by the ears to- gether, and excite more lover's quarrels, and caus' more sur- prises, and panics, and starts and tremors, than had probably ever afflicted any one night, since " the morning and the even- ing were the first day." "And at cock-crow she vanished. No one could have sworn to the identity, but it would have been impossible for Jacquelina to have proved an alibi during the ":hours passed by the Elfin Princess at the fancy ball. ! The next morning the fay was cited to appear before the family court, which held its session in the private parlor. And there she was informed of her doom, to be sent to the nunnery to school for one year. To the surprise of all, Jacquelina received this sentence with great calmness-only her eyes were really flashing beneath their demure lids, her lips were puckered up with a suppressed smile, and her whole form and face were instinct with the concealed anticipation of some unprecedented mischief and delicious fun. Oh I she was willing to go to the nunnery, certainly I there was nothing she would like better or so well I And so it was settled. The season at Bentley was now over. The visiters in num- : bers were leaving. And the family of Luckenough prepared to follow their example. . They returned to the lodgings at B. , where they were once more settled by the middle -of September. Preparations were then commenced for the outfit of Jacquelina. Her mother wept incessantly at the thought of parting from her darling though willful child, from whom she had never been separated in her life.- Jacquelina sought to comfort her. : "Don't fret,. Mimmy; I'll be back in a week!" she said, mys- teriously.                     "5Not so soon as that, my dear, I know. But, oh! Jacky, I never loved but you; and I do hope that your conduct will be so exemplary that your uncle will soon shorten the term of '  your imprisonment, and recall you. For I know that if he hears : -        *  t   THE   SPRITE  IN   THE   CONVENT.   227 good reports of you from the sisters, he will sacrifice the price of the whole term, and bring you home before it is ofer; for, with all his faults, he is not stingy." Y "No, indeed 1 And never you mind, Mimmy, my conduct shall be such that I will return- in a week!  "I hope 'so, indeed, my love; but it will not be quite so soon as that, I fear!" "Oh, Mimmy, you always fear something I I tell you I shall behave in such a way as to be brought back in a week Pl "Well, my "love, may be so; but I fear your old uncle wont trust so sudden a reform as that!" The convent-school selected for Jacquelina, was that of St. Serena, situated on Mount Serena, in a distant, hilly, and highly picturesque county. The day of her departure argved, and with many tears the members of the family took leave of Jac- quelina, who, with ill suppressed mirth and mischief peeping out from under her downcast eyelids, and out of the corners of her pursed up lips, entered the carriage with her uncle, and comrn menced her journey. The afternoon of the second day brought them near their journey's end. There is not in all the south a more beautiful country than that which surrounds the convent whose name I shall purposely veil under that of Mount St. Serena. It is broken, hilly, a;nd mountainous, clothed with fine forests, watered by crystal streams, and varied by rocks, caverns and waterfalls. A road through this highly picturesque scenery, running now by the side of a forest-shaded river, now under the shadow of some extended cliff; winding now around the base of soime wooded hill, and now through the tortuous defile of some moun- tain pass, brought our- travelers finally within the precincts of the convent grounds. ,A carriage dri;e through a fine piece of woods. led them; to the banks of the narrow, rock-bound, forest-tshaded, beautiful , river, St. Serena, where a ferry boat waited to take, them across. Upon the rising ground on the opposite side, in the midst of a grove of trees, gleamed the-white walls and chimneys of tho  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7871-00000107"/> 228     THE  MSSING   BRIDE. convent buildings. The main building,and all the lesser ones dependent upon it, were in the pure and elegant style of Gre- cian architecture. The grounds around them were highly im- proved and adorned with artificial lakes, grottos, groves, groups of statuary, arbors, shaded walks, and everything that wealth in the hands of'taste could procure to perfect -them in beauty and pleasure. And surrounding all was the undulating, hilly and mountainous country that I have described. The carriage containing our travelers entered the ferry boat, and- was poled across the river. Passing up a gentle ascent, they entered by a handsome gate upon a graveled and elm-shaded drive, that conducted them up to the front of the convent-a handsome, white granite front, with a portico supported by light Ionic columns, running the whole width. Here the carriage stopped, and the Commodore alighted, followed by Jacquelina,-whom he led up the marble stairs to the main entrance. The door stood wide open, and at once they entered the hall, across which, about six feet before them, stretched an iron gra- , ting, behind which sat a closely-veiled nun, with a great key- this was the porteress of the nunnery. The old -Commodore, keeping a respectful distance, bowed low and explained his business, and requested to see the Mother Superior. The porteress, without raising her veil, merely pointed to a door on their side of the grating, and on the left of the hall. The Commodore bowed again, and-conducted Jacquelina through that door into a plainly but neatly furnished parlor,- across the centre of which, from side to side, and from floor to ceiling, ran the same iron grating. Silently behind the grating appeared the shadow of the Lady I Superior. She was a comely and benignant looking woman, of about thirty years of age, and spoke in a voice so pleasant that its tones haunted the ear for days afterwards. As everything had been pre-arranged by an epistolary cor- ( *    F       .   THE   SPRITE   IN  THE  CONVENT.   229 respondence between herself and Commodore Waugh, there was now nothing to do but to, deliver Jacquelina into-her hands, and take leave.          The Commodore's heart sank lower and lower as the instant of departure hastened on. He detained his little "Minx" as long as possible-he would even now have gladly taken her back with him, had such a step been advisable for the pros- perity of his private plans--he wished to gather her to his bo- som and kiss her fondly-but he durst not do so within those holy walls, or in that holy presence; so, pressing her hand, and bidding her " be a good girl," and finally kissing her cheek in the most decorous manner, he took leave and departed, bitterly regretting the untoward fate that compelled him to leave his "Monkey" in " that gloomy prison," as he chose to miscall the most beautiful and enchanting place under the sun. Never distress yourself, Commodore I It would be difficult or impossible to reduce Jacquelina to a strait from which she could not deliver herself just as soon as she pleased. And while you are bemoaning her fate as you roll along towards home, her little head is busy in the devising of new mischief, which shall make you lament and deplore with much better rea- son than you do now. As the Mother Superior led Jacquelina along, she addressed her in a pleasant voice,saying, "My dear, are you fatigued, and would you like to go to the dormitory and lie down?" "No, mother, I am not the least tired." "This is the recreation hour, and the pupils, your future companions, are in the back lawn, amusing themselves; per- haps you would like to join them?" "Yes, mother." The lady then conducted Jacquelina through the great hall, down the back stairs, and out into the back lawn-where a peerless vision of beauty burst upon the sight of the young girl. If the grounds in front of the house were admirably laid out and adorned, those at the back were far more charming from  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7871-00000108"/> "230     TEIE  MSSING  BRIDE. natural beauty. In the midst was a small crystal ake, or pond, half surrounded by trees; green mounds and groves of trees stood here and there; and rocks and ravines, and banks of wild flowers and parterres of cultivated plants, diversified the scene. These grounds were terminated by or rather ran into a fine piece of woods that climbed up the sides of steep tere were assembled about one hundred young girls from the ages of s even to seventeen-engaged in various amuse- ments. Some were skipping ropes, some trundling hoops, some swinging, some mounted on Shetland ponies were pacing around the outskirts of the grounds, and some were in little boats rowed by the nuns upon the lake while others of quieter temperaments, were cultivating the flowers in the parterres, or gathered under the shade of trees, were dressing dolls or tell ing stories. "Yong ladies,i said the Mother Superior, as she appeared with Jacquelina, this is Miss L'Oiseaa, of St. Mary county. I hope that you will make her, welcome, and -make her fee} at home among you." Then calling one or two girls of about Jacquelina's own age, she introduced her to them, and left her in their care. But our fairy scarcely needed their introduction and patron- age; wherever there was youth and high spirits to be excited, or dullness to be exasperated, or mischief in any shape or form to be done, there was Jacquelina " at home." And soon the sprite had thrown herself like yeast into the crowd of young folks, and soon the whole mass was rising in a state of fermentation. The swings flew higher, the skIipping- ropes turned faster, the Shetland ponies no:longer paced, but galloped, reared and pranced with their riders, and the little skiffs no longer floated gently, but dashed and splashed among the sparkling waters, as if a whole shoal of water nymphs were at play, until the nuns who rowed, assured their romping pas. sengers that if they did not cease their sports, they would upset the boats. Even the quiet girls who had hitherto found ex- 9 9 wh  a  hterofud  x   APPARITION     IN THE DORlMTORY.    281 citement enough in tending flowers and dressing dolls, or tell- ing stories, now arose and contended with the others for the possession of the swings and skipping-ropes. In a word, the whole pleasure grounds were in a state of irrepressible effer- vescence, when the supper-bell rang and three or four Sisters came out to marshal the girls to -the refectory.* When supper was over, the crowd separated into their class-rooms, for the evening studies, after which they prepared to go to their various dormitories. CHAPTER   XVIII. APPARITION    IN THE DORMTORY. "Art thou a MAN."-M-acheth. JACQUELINA was assigned a place among the elder girls, whom she accompanied to their sleeping apartment, which was situated on the second floor. Nothing in the convent-that I have already described, excelled this place in beauty and purity of aspect; it seemed the very temple of Vesta--the innermost sanctuary of youth, beauty, and innocence. It was a long room, with snowy walls and ceilin g and floor- flanked by two rows of windows, with snowy linen blinds--fur- nished with two rows of white beds,.and their heads to the wall between the windows, and each closed in with curtains of white dimity. Now, standing!"at the entrance of this pure sanctuary,: look up the clear vista between the lines of snowy beds to t he opplpo Bite extremity of the room, and see a  beautiful :arched:sirine,  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7871-00000109"/> a  1U an w 5 I N G B RIDE.    \ veiled with the most delicate lace, which festoons each side, re- veal, within, a life-like image of the Virgin, in white robes, with her meek hands crossed upon her sinless bosom, and her meek eyes bent as in thought. Some young girl's devotion has placed upon her brow a wreath of fresh, fragrant, white roses. To a poetic eyeghe seems to stand there the guardian of the slumbers of pure and beautiful young girlhood. In the corners, to the extreme right and left of the Virgin's shrine, stood the bedsteads occupied by the two nuns who had charge of this dormitory, and the young girls who slept in it. These beds differed in no respect from those of the pupils, ex- cept they were a little larger.- Of the two duenna-nuns, Sister Agnes was a middle-aged lady, of severe and stately presence and stern rule. Sister Rose was a woman of twenty-five, with a fresh, girlish countenance, and a pleasant smile and voice. When Jacquelina was first introduced into this sweet, pure, peaceful retreat, she felt a sudden sharp pang-a sense of some- thing unquiet, inhuman, elfish in her nature, at variance with the beautiful character of the scene-some discord at war with this harmony-some chaos incompatible with this order-some evil, in short, that she wished was not there. Quietly each girl went within her own curtains to undress and go to bed. A few only gathered around- the smiling Sister Rose for a  good-night kiss. Some of the most warm-hearted and demonstrative, threw their arms around the beloved Sister and embraced her cordially. But the stern Sister Agnes frowned upon such freedoms, which she declared appertained to "inordinate and sinful affections of the flesh." This drew upon her the lightning flash of Jaccuelina's eyes, and, alas  put to flight all the fairy's redeeming thoughts, and inspired her with a  project of mischief which she resolved to put in execution, for the benefit of sour Sister Agnes, that very night. It was an unpardonable piece of diablerie, for which I can offer no palliation, except that the poor elf was on the high   APPARITION    IN  THE  DORMTORY.    23;t road to destruction, with not one wise friend to intervene and save her. And when you are inclined to severely blame poor Sans Souci, remember her educators. At last, all the young creatures were in bed, with their cur- tains drawn around them-all except Jacquelina. "Why don't you retire, my love?" inquired Sister Rose. 'Because I haven't got my night-clothes," said Jacquelina. "Haven't got your night-clothes--why how is that, my dear, whe-re are they?'" ,' Packed up in my trunk, wherever that may be." "Oh I yes, to be sure. I beg your pardon, my dear. It was my business to have attended to this-but I really forgot it. I often do forget things. Come with me, my dear, into the ware- room; your trunk is there," said Sister Rose, taking up a taper, and leading the way. They passed down a long passage, at the other end of which was the door leading into the wardrobe wareroom, where the clothing of the girls in this dormitory was kept, and where Jacquelina's trunk remained as yet unpacked. They entered, and while Sister Rose stood with her eyes bent upon the ground, pattering an Ave, Jacquelina knelt and un-, locked her trunk, took from it a night-dress and another suit, - (of which more anon,) and wrapping them together in a tight bundle, locked her trunk again, and arose to her feet. "It seems to me you have a large bundle there, my-dear," said the Sister. "Yes, I have other garments besides the night-dress," said Jacquelina. "Ah, yes  I suppose, after traveling you need a change, That is all right, under the circumstances. But hereafter, my dear, remember that the pupils change only on Sundays and Wednesdays, and on those mornings you will find clean clothes laid out upon your bed," said the Sister, and taking her taper, she paced soberly along, leading the way back to the dormitory, and followed by Jacquelina. When they entered it, Sister Rose walked up :and sat   -           "    &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7871-00000110"/> ar   --- 'HE  M SSING   B RID E her wax taper before the shrine of the Virgin, where it was intended to burn all night. Then she pointed out to Jacque! lina the bed she was to occupy, drew her up, and kissed her cheek, saying, "Good-night, love. I hope you will be happy with us. I hope you will sleep well. You mustn't be home-sick. All of us are separated from ourparents and friends here, but we are very happy-as you will be after a few days. Good-night, and pleasant dreams to you, dear '1" And the kind Sister kissed her once again, and let go her hand. And Jacquelina felt a twinge of compunction as she took herself and her mysterious bundle within her own curtains. She undressed and laid herself down, to wait until she should be reasonably sure that everybody in the room was asleep, be- fore commencing operations. Occasionally she peeped out between her curtains-how sweet and calm and pure was the aspect of the room, with its score of slumbering beauties, and the sleepless eyes of the Virgin watching over them I Oh, elfin Jacquelina, how could you bring- wild confusion and dismay into such a sweet and peaceful scene? She lay back upon her pillow, anxiously listening, until they should all be locked in the arms of slumber. Occasionally was heard the soft rustling of some young crea- tureifi her bed, like the fluttering of some young bird in its nest. But soon all these sounds ceased. The fair sleepers were all in the land of fairy dreams. But it seemed to Jacquelina that the sour Sister never would go to sleep-that she found no more favor in the eyes Mor- pheus, than of any other man. She sighed, and turned to the right, and then grunted and turned to the'left; and she "Ah, me".ed and "Oh, dear"-ed until the elf thought surely she must be suffering under that which is said to be the only real misery--great pain of body or remorse of mind. But it was neither of these things-it was only the sleeplessness caused by that good friend or bitter enemy, "green teal"-- -           -       l   APPARITION    IN  THE  DORMTORY.    285 that real and only "green-eyed monster" extant. At length, however, Sister Agnes was also sound asleep, as was proved by her deep and regular breathing. And Jacquelina peeped out between her curtains, and seeing everything still,'and the Virgin herself looking sweetly placid, as if she did not deem much harm in her wild child's frolic, she drew in her little mischief-brewing head, and commenced operations. Sitting up there in bed, she took off her night-cap and parted Iher hair in boyish style on one side, letting the short, bright,1 yellow curls cluster around her broad, fair forehead. Then she laid aside her night-wrapper, and dressed herself in that other suit aforesaid, which was no other than Cloudy's parade uni- form! And lastly, she set the gold-laced and tasseled cap jauntily upon her shining curls. And then she emerged from her hiding-place, and stood up, as charming looking a little officer as could be seen on a sunny day's review I All alive with mischief, she stood in the midst of the vista between the rows of snowy-curtained beds, and be- fore the white-veiled shrine of the Virgin, thinking whom she should first startle out of their sleep, and out of their wits, by a kiss! She soon made up her mind, and with her eyes twinkling f   roguishy, she tripped softly up the vista to the right-hand corner bed, occupied by Sister Rose, and stood over the pretty slum- berer.  How serene and sweet she seemed,.with her fair cheeks slightly flushed by sleep, and one soft, white handkpressing the crucifix lovingly, unconsciously to her softer, whiter bosom. Jacquelina's heart warmed towards her-she really wished now, not for "fun," but forlove, to stoop and kiss her as she lay! But in that dress I Even elfish Jacko hesitated to do it, hesita- ted to shock that pure and gentle bosom! So she-stood for a minute smiling on her. Baut the temptation to make mischief was too great, and bepiding over her, she kissed her--softly as a butterfly lights upon a flower, Sans Souci's lips touched sleep- ing Rose's -    &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7871-00000111"/> '236     'THE  MSSI'NG    BRIDE. Rosa awoke, and opened her sweet eyes calmly enough, but seeing, as she supposed, a young officer standing gazing upon her, she gave one wild, wild shriek, and covered up her head, where she lay trembling, like a captured bird. That shriek had roused all the sleepers. Jacquelina dipped suddenly down, and darting along close to the floor, reached the inside of her curtains, when she quickly and quietly drew her wrapper over the uniform, hid the gold laced cap under her pillow, and replaced-it by her night-cap, slipped into bed, drew the counterpane closely under her chin, and shut her eyes, as in a deep sleep. In the meantime, all was confusion in the dormitory. Every girl was out of bed, trembling with undefined terror, and asking everybody what was the matter. Sister Agnes was up also, and scolding at the top of her voice. And poor Rose was cry- ing, and lamenting, and wringing her hands. /   Jacquelina now ventured to peep through her curtains-there stood Sister Rose, with flushed cheeks, and wild, tearful eyes, twisting her fingers, and weeping, and protesting, and there gathered the flock of girls in their night-dresses and bare feet, and there stood Sister Agnes laying down the law. "Was ever such a distraction I What can you think of your. self, Sister Rose, to rouse all the school out of their beds with such a shriek as that I How do you know but you've wakened the pupils in the other dormitories, too? And the Mother ; Superior, for aught we know " "Oh I indeed, indeed it wasn't my fault 1 Indeed it wasn't " "It was your fault I If you had been thinking more of your aves and paters, and less of vanities, you would not have dreamed of seeing a  one of those creatures '" "Ohl : It was a man, it was a man!

Some of the girls turned to seek once more their pillows. But Rose caught the robe of Sister Agnes, and said, "Oh, Sister 1 pray, pray have the room searched I There was a man in itl"  "Have done with such sinful fancies!" exclaimed Sister Agnes, angrily. "Oh, Holy Virgin I will nothing convince her? And are we all to go to bed while there is such a monster in the room l" A "You certainly are frantic I You want blood-letting Will you look around now upon those well-secured windows, and that double-locked door, and tell me, even supposing such a creature could possibly get through the outer grate, how  it could get in here, or being in, where it could hide, or how it could get out? You're a fool, Sister Rosel St. Mary for- give me 1" But Sister Rose persisted that she had spoken the truth, and pleaded so earnestly to have the room searched, that all the young girls, with one accord, flitted out of their beds like birds from their nests, and looked underneath them-looked every- where-went to Miss L'Oiseaul's bed and looked under that, then peeped between her curtains to see how soundly she slept. 15  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7871-00000112"/> O  -    '1 Jz fi iy O 1 U  J^ I . "- Tired to death with her long journey, poor thing," they said, softly closing her curtains again. "Yes, young ladiesl" said Sister Agnes, severely, 'Miss L'Oiseau is an example to you I You don't see her starting up out of her bed at this unholy hour of the night, to assist in raising a confusion I And I hope that in future you will profit by her example I And now, young ladies, that you have proved for yourselves that there is nothing in this dormitory, more sin- ful and dangerous than your own follies, I hope that you will go quietly to bed, and stay there. And as for you, Sister Rose, I shall remember to do to-morrow as I said i" And, frowning and angry, Sister Agnes retired to her couch. And, laughing unmercifully at Sister Rose and her graphic dream, the girls retired to theirs. And sighing and weeping, and praying forgiveness of the Virgin, for having permitted Satan to deceive her with a sinful dream--for such she now felt convinced it must have been- Sister Rose lay down upon hers. And shaking her fist threateningly at the sour sister, Jacque- lina peeped out from her curtains. The wicked fairy had not half finished her frolic yet-the best part of it was to come. She had to wait, a long time before everything was quiet-the girls would peep out and whisper to their nearest neighbors, who would reply again. And Sister Rose sighed and sobbed softly on her pillow. And Sister Agnes turned and tossed, and grunted and groaned, and "ohi dear me"-ed worse than before. The clock struck twelve before all was again in repose. And  still Jacquelina waited nearly half an hour, to be certain that no one awoke and watched. But at length she was convinced that they were all asleep, and all the more soundly for having been once disturbed. Then the elf once more arose, dropped the wrapper and took ' off the night-cap, arranged her yellow curlsas before, and set the jaunty middy's cap aside upon them-and coming out from her concealment, stepped softly up to the left hand corner bed, occupied by Sister Agnes. Her bed was uncurtained, like that of Sister Rose; but here all resemblance ceased.   APPARITION IN THE DORMTORY. 239 This was quite a different picture. Sister Agnes lay stretched out beneath her coverlet, with her head straight upon the pillow, as rigidly as if she were an effigy carved in marble, 'or a corpse laid out for burial-with both hands clasped upon her -hard chest, and grasping the crucifix with a grim grip, as if she had a grudge against the blessed emblem, and meant that it should not escape while she slept. Her stern features were sterner still in sleep. Her eye-lids seemed as if they had been shut down and then screwed down; and the hard, thin, wiry, firmly closed lips seemed&amp;to be shut up and locked up with a key. Jacquelina looked and laughed at that rigid figure, at that stern face, and especially at that severe, repellant mouth. "Steel-springs, and rat traps, and crossed-cut saw teeth!" she exclaimed. "I had as lief march my lips up and kiss the muz- zle of a pistol while the fiend held the trigger I However, it would never do for the uniform to show the pwhite feather, even under those circumstances I So here goes! Verjuice, verdigris and vitriol, though, I know it's going to be dreadful " she said, making a very wry face as at the sight of a very bitter draught; and then gathering resolution to swallow it, she suddenly pounced down, and gave the stern sleeper a rousing salute I "Ah-trr-r-r-r-ahl Ah-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-oitch Ah-r-rrr-r-r-r-r- oitch-aw!" yelled Sister Agnes, jumping out of bed I No hyena-no screech-owl, ever screamed forth such a hor- rible yell I No form of English letters could give an idea of the harsh, discordant shrieks that seemed to massacre alike the air and the sense of hearing Every girl sprang out of her bed, shaking 'n the last extremity of terror at those awful shrieks. Sister Rose was among them, white as her night*robe, clasping her bands and pattering her ave. Jacquelina had run away at the first alarm, and taken shelter in her curtains. "Murder I murder I murder 1" continued to shriek Sister Ag- nes, like one demented. "What is the matter? Oh! St. Mary, what is the matter?V cried the girls, wringing their hands, in-the last agony of terror. But as Sister Agnes only ran about with wild eyes, and mouth  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7871-00000113"/> ZiAV    T   iM 1 b  N  B i D  .         e  agape, giving forth those ear-splitting shrieks-they clapped their hands to their bruised and wounded ear-drunis, and followed her exampfe, running about and screaming with all their might, ,until soon was heard the sound of many feet, rushing in crowds along all the passages towards the door of this dormitory. All the nuns, all the teachers, all the pupils, were roused up and pouring thither, while the alarm'bell of the- convent was ringing as if gone mad I The crowd was at the door, the girls ceased their shrieking, and ran and unlocked it. And in pushed the whole convent, with the Mother Abbess at its head. At her coming the whole confusion and distracting noise abated.   I "What is the matter?" inquired the Abbess. And-"Oh I what is the matter? Oh! what on earth is the matter?" breathlessly inquired all the nuns, novices and pupils. "Silence, Sisters I silence, children! Leave the investigation to0me," commanded the Mother, of her followers. Then turn- ing to the crowd of frightened girls, she asked, "Has anything really happened? - Tell me the occasion of this outcry. What is it?" "Oh I we don't know I we don't know I But we think there is-a-man in the dormitory!" "A man in the room I Holy St. Mary!" exclaimed all the profoundly shocked nuns, novices, and pupils. "A man in the room-impossible!" said the Abbess, while the girls crowded around her, all-talking at once, and saying, 'We were all asleep, and Sister Agnes screamed out I It-- was Sister Agnes!" "Silence, young ladies, and let Sister Agnes come forward and speak for 'herself. This is really very irregular I Sister Agnes, please to explain the cause of this false alarm-for such I must believe it, since it is absolutely impossible that. a man should be here." Sister Agnes came forward, turning -up the whites of her eyes, and crossing herself-and amid many groans and sighs, told the shocking story of a handsome young officer, in uni- form, who was hidden somewhere in the room, and had come to her bedside and kissed her in her sleep I   APPARITION    IN  THE  DORMTORY. 241 Among the girls who listened to this exciting explanation, was the " culprit fay,'" herself, who stood there with her flow- ing night-dress effectually concealing the suit of uniform worn beneath it, and with the middy's tasseled cap also hidden under it. The Lady Abbess listened to the story with a very grave  face. She was a fair and comely woman of thirty, :full Ffteen years younger than Sister Agnes, notwithstanding she held, as she deserved to hold, the superior rank. She heard the whole tale to its close, deferring all comment for the' present. Then she calmly ordered that the room should be thoroughly searched. And the girls started on the enterprise- ' Away they ran and the hunt began, Each corner to search, each nook to scan, The highest, the lowest, the murkiest spot, They searched for the culprit, and found him not." Of course not I Though the room was thoroughly " sifted," no  vestige of an intruder could be found. They hunted every- where-they looked under every bed, within every set of curtains, shook all the pillows, turned up all the mattrasses, examined the shrine of the Virgin, hunted every nook and cranny. Some of the girls, in their zeal, turned their boots upside down and unrolled and shook their stockings-but no hidden enemy dropped out; some, in absence of mind, opened and whirled the leaves of their mass books, but found the pictures of men only. In short, so thorough was the search, that if a pin had been missing, it must have been found 1 They searched every- where, except (as usuaD the right place, (Jacquelina's unsus- pected person,) and no sign of the enemy could be seen. It was no use-there was no man there 1 The alarm was a false one, that was clear. And got up by Sister Agnes, who vowed and protested in vain. Nobody believed her. The girls laughed at her, and the Mother Abbess looked very grave.. -  "I am very much mortified, Sister Agnes," she said, "to, be under. the painful necessity of rebuking you here, in the pre- sence of these young ladies, your youthful charge, whom your  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7871-00000114"/>    i Iu 1 M IN ( BRIDE. irreproachable conduct should rather teach to respect you I It is humiliating to see a woman of your grave and sober years and sacred ealling, the subject of such vain and foolish dreams and visions, as must totally unfit you for the post of chief guardiangto these young creatures. mYou will therefore be pleased to-consider yourself displaced, and to leave the dorm i. tory this night. I will assign you a cell before I sleep. Sister Serena, you will take Sister Agnes's vacated place."      A And thus having administered justice, the LadyAbbess mar- shaled her followers, and withdrew from  the dormitory, the  crest-fallen Sister Agnes going after them; and Sister Serena  remaining in her stead,  The young girls, exhausted by so much excitement, sought  their pillows, and soon fell asleep. And Jacquelina whispered in confidence to her pillow, "So much for the first day 1" "TThere's a cold bearing, And grave, severe aspect about the man, As make our spirits pay him such respect, as though he dwelt 'neath age's silvery pen Mhouse, Despite his years."--Fanny Kemble. Tar morning came, and Jacquelina was puzzled to know here to conceal her contraband uniform.  The moment was imminent. The girls were all rising and Ding into the hall conneted with 'the dormitory, where, ranged )  and down the sides of the walls, were rows of wash-stands, ch numbered with the number of the owner. Jacquelina rolled up the suit in the smallest possible com- sc, and put it under the mattrfses hoping that it might re    DOC TOR    GRIMSHAW.         :243 main hidden until she could devise some other hiding place-for it. She knew it would never do to put it in her trunk, where it would be certain of being found, when Sister Rose should unpack it. So she was forced to leave it for the present where it was, hoping the best. And she went into the hall, or bathing, or dressing-room, whichever it might be called, and had a wash-stand pointed- out for her future use. Then Sister Rose went to her trunk and gave her out her soaps, brushes, combs, napkins, etc. The girls were not tempted to linger over their -toilets, for there were no looking-glasses in the apartment, not the smallest apology for one--the nuns interdicted them as savoring of the vanities of the world. So the young ladies soon completed their hasty toilets, and were marched down into the chapel for matins. And when this was over they were marched in the same order to the refectory for breakfast. And all the while Jacquelina's thoughts were running upon the awful suit of uniform, that dead body hidden under her mattrass l--her emotions being divided between curiosity, anx- iety, and mirth. She had not long to wait, for just as the pupils had risen from the table, and were marching out of the refrectoryone of the lay-sisters came up and quietly singling out Jacquelina, informed her that the Mother Superior desired her presence in the dormitory. Jacquelina was one of those creatures, who, unless, she had some great sin upon her conscience, would have jested on the scaffold I And as she followed the lay-sister, all seinsations of  anxiety gave way to the thrilling anticipation of fun to cotne in the looks of the horrified Mother Abbess and her nuns. ,  But Jacko was destined to be a; little disappointed. The lay-sister attended her to the door of the dormitory, and  left her.  She went in. There was no one there but the Ab- bess and Sister Rose-the uniform was nowhere in sight.   i { Shut the door and lock it, Miss L'Oiseau,' said- the Ab,  bess, in a grave voice. k                   - of!  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7871-00000115"/> Yrr:    'THE   MSSING    BRIDE.  x                   ]! \Jacquelina did as she was bidden, saying to herself, "I wonder if they are goings to bring me before a secret chapter, and have me inhumed alive for my frolic ?" as she approached them, half laughing. The Abbess and Rose were standing near her bed. There also she saw a packet, neatly done up and pinned in a clean napkin, which she felt sure must contain the uniform. {"Miss L'Oiseau," commenced the elder lady, speaking in a grave, sad voice, "I need not tell you that the cause of the alarm last night has been discovered. For your own sake, as well as for the sake of our convent, and the young creatures it shelters, I thank the saints that no one is in the secret of your fault except myself and Sister Rose, in whose discretion I have the utmost confidence.  But after this indelicate joke, (to use no harsher term,) I must separate you from the young ladies, who should have been your companions. Until I hear from your friends, to whom I am about to write, a full account of this matter, you will share my apartment, and be under my personal charge. Sister Rose, conduct Miss L'Oiseau thither. Jacquelina's face, for the very first time in her life, blazed with an overwhelming     sense of humiliation.  She had never ; looked on her frolic in so severe a light-she had never consi- dered its impropriety-indeed she had never considered at all- she had- acted from  impulse. And now that she was made to feel- and see a certain indelicacy in her practical joke, her face burned with blushes, and her girlish shame was mingled with indignation against those who had made her feel it. We know that she. was very perverse. Smiling and nodding her head at the dignified Lady Superior, she said that she was content- that in the privacy of her room  she should find ample time  to ; devise some   new entertainment for herself, and that she was as fertile in resources as any Jesuit among them I And so saying she followed Sister Rose. The abbess wrote that day, and in the course of a  day or two came an answer. from  Commodore Waugh, enclosing a letter to his niece. His letter to the Abbess explained something   DOCTOR    G R I M SHAW.     245 of Jacquelina's naturally elfish nature assuring her that it was for the cure of this very fault that he had placed her under the charge of the pious sisterhood; begging her not to consider her fault too severely-saying that what, in a model young lady of society, might be deemed a shocking impropriety, -was, in his wild little Jacko, a mere venial error, entreating her to ac- cept the apology and atonement that he should command his niece to make; and to try her a little longer. The letter to Jacquelina was quite another matter--it was short--not sweet, but crusty and characteristic. I apologise for the necessity of introducing it. BENEDICT, Oct. 15th, 1821.

This edifying admonition restored Jacquelina to herself, by putting to flight all her new feelings of maiden propriety, and bringing back by association, all her love of fun, frolic and deviltry. - Laughing immoderately she seized her pen and wrote as follows: CONVENT OF ST.

And what do you think was the result of it? Why that in about another day and a half, Commodore Waugh came in a state of mind be. ^ tween a panic and a fury, and took his exemplary niece home. The journey was performed on the part of the Commodore in unmitigated sulkiness. Only once had he condescended to address Jacquelina, and that was only to inform her that he was tired of the responsibility of taking care of her-that it was necessary he should secure her from future harm, and that as soon as they should arrive at home, she should forthwith be married to Grim'--that is, if Grim' would have such an un- worthy piece of goods as herself. "He'd better not,"- laughed Jacquelina. "I'd be the death of him in a twelvemonth." Little did the fairy dream she had uttered a prophecy I The Commodore condescended to make -no comment on her words, and the journey proceeded in silence. They reached home at the close of the second day. "What did I tell you, Mimmy?" exclaimed Jacquelina, throwing herself into her mother's arms. Didn't I say I'd be home in a week?-and here I am 1P' , (-"Oh I Jacquelina I you will ruin us both I you will break my ' r: heart 1" cried Mrs. L'Oiseau, repelling her caresses and push- ; i -ing her away. Not that she was shocked and angered by Jac- quelina's frolics, as-that she was afraid, poor piteous creature, to show" her child any affection in the Commodore's presence. Mary L'Oiseau, in her humble home at Old Fields, had pos- sessed some self-respect, if little self reliance, but the promising change in her prospects --the domination of Commodore I  Waugh, and the hopes and fears concerning the inheritance of Luckenough, had been sufficient to disturb the whole free action of her soul, and make her the shrinking, cringing, timorous creature that we find her now. She was afraid to be kind to her daughter lest she should offend the Commodore. She was not afraid, by submitting to the Commodore, to offend God. For much as .she dreaded the dies' irea, yet when the   DOCTOR    GRIMSHAW.        247 fear of God and the fear of man contended in her bosom, the nearest dread, the fear of 'man-prevailed. So she kept her daughter at a cold distance. Mrs. Waugh only dared to be , kind to Jacquelina. The Commodore was amusing himself by making his family as uncomfortable and anxious as he possibly could under the circumstances. Their apartments at the village hotel were extremely limited -consisting only of a small parlor and two tiny bed-rooms, one occupied by himself and Henrietta, and the other by Mary L'Oiseau and Jacquelina-the whole suite, you perceive, scarcely big enough for the Commodore to "blow out" and storm in. So for hours after breakfast he would sit in the big arm chair in the parlor, puffing great volumes of smoke from his tobacco- pipe, and filling all- the rooms and scenting all the window- curtains, bed-draperies and wearing apparel with the stifling vapor, till between smoke and fear, Mary L'Oiseau was always ill. And bad as that was, it was not the worst-that only in- flicted discomfort; another practice gave the greatest uneasi- ness--the Commodore would spend his afternoons and nights playing cards and losing money in the bar-room; How long this would have lasted, or how far it might have progressed, it is impossible to tell; had not "' Locust Hill," the place of Mr. Hughes, deceased, been advertised for rent. And as Luckenough was far enough from completion, and as the Commodore himself was smothering for want of space, he rented it at once, sent to Baltimore for furniture, which he said would do to help to refurnish Luckenough. As -oon as it arrived he went once more to housekeeping. "Locust Hill" was a moderate sized country house, situated on a gentle elevation, just outside of the village, and sur- rounded by a grove of the trees from which it was named. More servants were sent for from the quarters at Luckenough; and here the family found themselves, as to external surround- ings, tolerably comfortable in body, if bodily comfort could co- exist with such anxiety of mind as they -vere called upon to endure.  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7871-00000117"/> 248     THE  MSSING   BRIDE. For, oh t the Commodore continued his visits to the village hotel, where he would frequently play until he lost a large sum of money, and then he would come home in the most ungovernable rage with the whole family-swearing that they were the most extravagant set of people that had ever ruined a man or brought themselves to beggary-that he would not be trampled on by them any longer-that Henrietta should be cut down to one quarter of her present outlay .for household provisions, and that that little devil should be married to Grim', or should tramp with her fool of a mother forthwith I And that was all poor Mary got for her submission. Such threats regularly sent her to bed with a sick headache. And he swore that in his own house he was "supreme ruler," and meant that they should know it, too I And, indeed, with the sums of money he was losing at the gaming-table, and the sums he was expending in the rebuilding of Luckenough, Henrietta became so alarmed, that, with the piteous ineffectual manner of women under such circumstances, she began first to economise in her personal comforts-  saving pennies while he was wasting pounds. Among other things-whereas she had been accustomed to have two  or three seamstresses in the house twice a year, to make up the clothing for the plantation negroes-now she and Mary L'Oiseau undertook, with the help of the maid Maria, to do the whole work, and night after night they might be seen gathered around the table, sewing diligently by the light of two home-dipped tallow candles. Now what do you think the Commodore actually did upon one nigh? Coming home from the village, after having lost more money than usual, he seized one of these candles, and turned it down into its socket, exclaiming, "I'll be shot if retrenchment mustn't commence somewhere!" And the building up of Luckenoughl The architect and his subordinates had a time of it For it was the first time that the Commodore had ever had the importance and excitement and eOToyment of a  builder-and every morning he rode over to Luckenough, and passed the forenoon in " dragooning" the   DOCTOR    GRIMSHAW.        249 contractor, and driving the workmen, making them pull down this, and alter that, and put up the other, in open defiance of all rules of building, until the men were nearly driven to their wits' ends, and the time and cost of completing the house was extended indefinitely. Indeed all-family, dependants, and hired assistants, were so thoroughly worn out with the Commodore, that his best friends in --their hearts prayed for the coming of the fogs and rains of November, that should literally " lay him up by the legs" in his own room, and confine his domination within limited bounds. At last, towards the latter end of November, their prayers seemed answered, and the Commodore, swathed in flannels, and wrapped in blankets, reclined in his great easy-chair, with his leg laid out upon pillows on another. And from the neighborhood of this chair, Henrietta sedu. lously kept everything that could be used as a missile, eaven his crutch. His meals used to be served on a little stand beside his chair-but one day he threw a fork at poor Maria, wound-  ing her face, and narrowly missing destroying her eye. And after that, Henrietta cut his victuals up into small mouthfuls, and sent him up a teaspoon to eat with. You may imagine the furious storm that arose then, and how the Commodore hurled plate, bowl and pitcher all through the window-glass into the yard. But Henrietta told him it was of no use, that though every member of the family, from herself down to the least servant, should serve him faithfully, yet she could not have people, especially poor, helpless maid-servants, killed, crippled, or blinded, in her house; that she should certainly send him no more knives and forks, and if he threw another china plate through the window sash, she should send him up his food on a large cabbage leaf, and his drink in a gourd. If he would act like a madman he must be treated as such-people were not to be exposed to wanton injury, nor property to n anton destruction.  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7871-00000118"/> 250     THE   MSSING   BRIDE. A notable. blessing was the result, for the Commodore swore a furious oath, by all the demons, that not one, of the family should enter his room again during his illness, that he would be nursed only by Grim', and waited on only by Festus ("Stupe "). This new law was immediately executed. Grim' was sum. moned and installed as nurse, and Festus brought from Luck- enough and established as waiter, to the inexpressible relief of the sorely fatigued and harassed family. And all went on smoothly enough for a while, until one day, when Grim' was dressing the swollen limb, Festus, with a basin of hot water, approached trembling, as he always did when he drew near his dangerous and uncertain master. "Drop that basin on my leg, you little rascal, you 1". vocife- rated the Commodore, seeing how shakingly he held it. When forthwith Festus, the literal interpretist, dropped the basin upon the leg, as be was bid. A horrible yell burst from the Commodore, who, with-one galvagic bound, overset -Grim', and seized Festus by the ears, and dragging him up within the bear hug of one arm, pum- meled him with the other until the boy was black and blue, and the Commodore himself exhausted. This brought on a severe crisis of his disease. He had to be put to bed, the doctor had to be summoned, and a long and serious fit of illness ensued. Mrs. Waugh, of course, was im- mediately reinstated. Dr. Grimshaw, at the Commodore's invitation, became ant inmate of the house, which -was so convenient to the village where his daily duties called him.           i Whenever the Commodore was sufficiently free from pain and fever, Mrs. Waugh and Mary L'Oiseau were sent from the room, and Grim' was summoned. And long consultations were held by the two conspirators in the sick room. The result was, that Dr. Grimshaw became the daily perse- cutor of Jacquelina. But the beautiful elf mocked and derided him I turned him into all sorts of ridicule! laughed him to scorn!   OCTOR    G RIM SHAW.       251 And the more she charmed and fascinated him by her laugh- ter and her sparkling wit.-leveled at himself though it was- the more- impassioned he became; declaring that her girlish scorn, was but the effervescing bead upon the champagne- showing the excellency of the wine.          ; And the more earnest he became, the more unmercifully she jibed and jeered at him-.the more immoderately she laughed. Until one day when, as he vowed in his :singularly sweet tones that he loved her to distraction, she ordered him to go down on both his knees and tell her-so; and then, and.,not till then, she would give him an answer; for how daredhe make a declaration of love to her from any other position? And when the lost, infatuated man actually obeyed her laughing behest, and dropped upon his knees at her feet, she fell back in her chair, and laughed herself nearly into convulsions. The Pro- , fessor began to feel humilitated and indignant, and once or twice made a start to rise; but, between her peals of laughter, Jacquelina raised her finger and told him not that he was to stay there,and wait for her answer. And there she ;kept-Jim until she became tired of the, fun; then, recovering from the last paroxysm of her laughter, she said, "Doctor Grimshaw, not to keep you in suspense, I never intend to be married at all 1 I scorn the idea And, least of all men, would I have you! for, dearest Ghoul, not to flatter you, I had as lief wed Old Time, with his scythe,:,or Death, with his skull and cross-bones'1" His teeth 'closed with a snap-he started up with a spring, and darting upon her a look of mingled longing and hatred, he hissed, "Very well I -we shall see that "' "Why, what does the Fright mean?" said Jacquelina, arenh ing her eyebrows and pursing her lips; " are -threats and ill- temper the way to win a- lady's love?" But Grim' had -gone-gone to answer a summons from the Commodore, sent an hour before.       " Now, Doctor. Grimshaw was no fright, though by no means so handsome as the partial eyes of the Commodore foc;d him.

He was extremely tall and thin, with rounded, stooping shoulders, like those of the Commodore himself. He chose always to be clothed in a tight suit of solemn black--a style of dress that was characteristic of the man, and which exaggerated the tall, thin, spectral look of his figure, and the pale, livid, hue of his complexion. He had black hair and eyes, and eyebrows that nearly met at the narrow, sunken root of his long nose; his cheeky were hollow, and his--chin projecting, and his teeth had a habit of catching with a snap, when anything suddenly enraged him. One looked at him with a mingled feeling of fear, dislike, and pity-as if he were very little more responsiblek'for the evil and danger that might be in him, than the serpent is for its fangs and venom; as if his faults were those of -original sin and hereditary growth, rather than of his own willful importation and cultivation. Ignatius Loyola Grimshaw was a foreigner by birth; he had come over with the Commodore when the latter returned to his native country, and the influence of the old man had obtained him his present position and standing in the county. Some surprise was expressed, and some conjectures made, concerning the unusual interest and great affection the rugged old soldier bore to his protege; but, as time passed, and the walk of Doctor Grimshaw was exemplary to a degree, these suspicions and conjectures gradually died out, and the partiality of the old man for the young one was set down as one of his unaccountable whims. And so Doctor Grimshaw grew in favor with man, if not with Him who seeth not as man seeth. Such-was the pet of Commodore Waugh and the lover of Jacqlelina.-such the man whose love she- made the object of her merry scorn. Poor Sans Soucil her laughing days were almost over  The Commodore, like the frozen adder of the fable, was " com- ing round" again, under the tender care of Henrietta and Mary L'Oiseau, and was preparing to sting at least one of the hands that had nursed him back to life, namely,'l"poor, misfortnlt   DOCTOR    GRIMS HAW.       253 Miss Mary," as Jenna called her--Jenny, who now freely de- clared that she was very sorry she had ever "'vised her to go E to Old Nick." The Commodore swore that he knew how "to make Jacquelina knuckle under,"'and that he meant to do it, just as soon as he was able to use his limbs. It was now the middle of December. The snow was on the grounld, and the weather was bitterly cold. One morning, during a snow-storm that kept all the family and all the female servants confined within doors, the Commodore seized the oc- casion to send fokiJacquelina to his room. She came in laughing at some merry jest that she had left behind. But the Commodore sternly motioned her to a seat, which she took, and fearlessly waited for him to speak. He told her roundly that he had come to the fixed and un- alterable determination to have her married to Grimshaw, at Christmas-and .that she might go and prepare herself 'for an honor that he considered far above her merits. "So much above my merits," said the elf, nodding her saucy head at him, " that I haven't the least idea of accepting it." "And by all the fiends in flames I Miss, you sHALL accept itl I'll be shot to death if I'll be fooled by you, or trampled on by your mother any longer-?" "Trampled on by my mother   'Holy saints!" laughed Jacquelina, "the idea of my poor, timorous Mimmy trampling on anybody, much less you!" "You laugh, you limb you I I'll make you laugh on the wrong side of your mouth before I've done with you "I "Which is the wrong side, uncle?" "Silence, Minx, before I box your ears"  "I vow, if you were to do that, uncle, I'd seize your sick leg and give it such a loving squeeze, as would put you to bed for another month!"

"It would certainly be only by that agency, if I were-foi surely no such marriage as that could be made in heaven. Look you here, uncle," she said, half laughing, though wholly in earnest; "I would not marry Doctor Grimshaw for Luck- enough, and all that it will contain-no, not to save his life, nor my own, nor yours, uncle! I would sooner see Luck- enough burned again to the ground, and the soil ploughed up and sown with salt, to make it a sterile desert forever. I would sooner see Doctor Grimshaw hung, and you in your grave, and myself in my coffin-than doomed to the living tomb of a mar- riage with Doctor Grimshaw 1" "Then, by heaven I 'll turn you out of doors." "No you wont, by 4 heaven,' uncle. You will do it by the other agency y"u mentioned!" laughed Jacquelina, "I'll give you until Christmas, to come to your senses-but if upon Christmas eve you are not prepared to marry Doctor Grimshaw, I'll-thrust you into the street to starve 1" "You can do that but, praise be to the Lord! you can't make me marry Doctor Grimshaw I So you do as you please, uncle and do it as soon as you pleasel -I would rather beg ; - my bread, free and merry, than be the wife of that man I No earthly power can or shall compel me to marry Doctor Grim- shaw I Fiddle-de-dee I The very idea of such a thing!" she exclaimed, leaving her earnestness, and by a sudden transition, breaking into an uncontrollable fit of laughter. In a rage, her uncle drove her from the room, and she ran off to finish her fit of laughing in her own apartment.

The only way by which he could control Jacqueina, was through her affection for her mother--for filial love was now the sole human and vulnerable part of the fairy's nature, and he did not-shrink from attacking that point. JEtcquelina had continued to laugh-at his threats, and to defy his fury. And he felt at last that she would, in her own per- son, brave any fate, rather than have an unwelcome marriage forced upon her.

This watchfulness ahd these admonitions had increased so much of late, that they had attracted Jacquelina's attention, and directed it to her' mother-and the young girl noticed for the first time that: she was very thin, and that her voice was weak, and her footsteps Taint and slow--yet every day, after dinner, when the invalid had such a fine color, and such a flow, of spirits, Jacquelina was reassured. One day, however, when Mrs. Waugh had been more than usually anxious in her thoughtfulness for the poor little woman, Jacquelina followed her aunt to her -room, and asked, gravely, "Aunty I is there anything the matter with my Mimmy?" The tears swam in Henrietta's eyes as she looked at' the girl. "Your mother has not been well for a long time, my dear. She is neither well nor happy-therefore you must be very attentive to her, Lapwing, and very careful not to wound or disturb her in any way by your frolics, or you may some day greatly repent it." "Aunty I you don't mean to say that Mimmy is seriously ill?" "Yes, my dear, she is seriously out of health I but we can do much to help her-especially you can, Lapwing. You are her only child, and her greatest comfort, and you must do all ,that you can to serve her." "I am sure I will, aunty I There is nothing in the world I would not do for my Mimmy  But you don't, you don't-think there is any danger, do you?" she asked, as her eyes overflowed with tears.          -, "Oh, no, my dear I No immediate danger. We must be very careful of her--that is all!" But the young girl was not satisfied-a weight had fallen upon her heart-she had learned to ponder, to watch, to hope, and to fear, for one she loved "whom death might touch." From that day forth, she watched her mother's changing face   CLIPPING     A  BIRD'S WING S.*.   257 with tenderness and anxiety, waiting on her, anticipating her wishes, saving her steps and labor, shielding her from harm, and from her uncle's frequent harshness, in a way that no one would have believed of the elf. In the night she often left her bed to creep on tiptoe to her mother's room, to ascertain if she slept soundly, and often find- ing her awake and feverish, she would slip down stairs, and go to the distant spring to get a pitcher of fresh water to lave her burning head, and slake her burning thirst, These night fe- vers would go off towards morning in a profuse perspiration, and Mary L'Oiseau would rise, though weak, and go about the house as usual. But the clouds were fast gathering over poor Sans Souci's heavens. The Commodore had quite recovered for the time being, and he began to urge the marriage of his niece with his favorite. Doctor Grimshaw's importunities were also becoming very tire. some. They were no longer a jest., She could no longer divert herself with them. She felt them as a real persecution, and expressed herself accordingly. To Glrim' she said, "Once I used to laugh at you. But now ' do hate you more than anything in the universel And I wish--I do wish that you were in Heaven I for I do detest the very sight of you- there!" And to the Commodore's furious threats she would answer, "Uncle, the time has passed by centuries ago for forcing girls into wedlock, thanks be to Christianity and civilization. You can't force me to have Grim', and you had as well give iupt the wicked purpose," or words to that effect. One day when she had said something of the sort, the Com- modore answered cruelly,          * "Very well, Miss!

Without the ceremony of knocking, he burst the door open with one blow of his foot, and entered where the poor, feverish, frightened creature was lying dpwn to take a nap. Throwing himself into a chair by her bedside, he commenced a furious attack upon the trembling invalid.

"I will tell you, after you take- some refreshments," said Jacquelina. "Well I go bring me some."  The girl went and brought more hot tea and toast, and waited until her mother had drank the former, and partaken of a morsel of the latter. When, in answer to the eager, inquiring look, she said' "Mother if I alone were concerned, I would leave this house this moment, though I should never have another roof over my head.

'I will see what can be done to bring everybody to reason I H will not believe but that if Iremain firm and faith. ful to my heart's integrity, there will be some way of escape made between these two alternatives." But could Sans Souci do this? Had the frolicsome fairy sufficient -integral strength and self-balance to resist the power- fill influences gathering around her? The clouds thickened' and darkened over her head. The circle of irresistible fate seemed closing about her. And her efforts to dissolve the spell, and throw off the influence, were fitful, flighty, and ineffectual. And what was it that crippled and distracted, and made impotent her resistance? It was her love for her sick, and helpless, and timid mother. Not much reverence had Jacquelina for that mother--not much reverence for anything on earth, had the elf; but a tender, nursing love, without much respect-a love whose character was betrayed in the petting and protecting manner, and the childish names by which the young girl would address her parent. That poor, weak mother was the stumbling block in her path of rectitude. Had she been alone, her elastic spirit would have thrown off all weight, and stepped forth, free and fearless, into God's world of work; and bthe forest fairy would have become a toiling kitchen " browhie," rather than have bartered her freedom for sloth and wealth. But the choice lay between her own happi- ness and her mother's ease' and comfort! It was, therefore, with something like a wild, amazed despair, that the girl some- times realized the facts of her position, and contemplated the impending doom. For, battle and strive as the poor thing might, who could doubt the issue? Neither did the Commo- dore leave her at peace for- a single day. She avoided her uncle as much as she possibly could, and defied him when she met him. As thus-when encountering him on the stairs or at the table, he would ask her,   CLIPPING     A BIRD' S WINGS.    265 "Well, are you making preparations for getting married, or for leaving the house, which?"

"Grinl' could restrain you." "I'd break his heart I I'd drive him raving mad, and make him commit suicide l"- "Grim' will risk that. - "I'll end it all, and drown myself, before I'll marry him!" "And I'll risk that." And many such conversations as this would ensue between the uncle and the niece. And Sans Souci would always leave him with her spirits all on fire with opposition. And, going into her mother's roomp, she would exclaim, "Mimmy I Be a woman I Bear up, Mimmy I Oh, Mimmy I try do get well, and help me to withstand this monstrous wickedness." But little help did the poor girl get from her feeble mother, i. vho woul(d still receive 'her pleadings with such words as these ',Oh, Jacqueliaal your perverseness will break my heart," jr, " oh, you wild, misguided child I you will kill me." "Mimmy, you know I love you better than all the world." "I know you pretend to love me; but you are so selfish and hard hearted, that you would rather see me die here than give ,up your own wild, foolish will, even when to give it up would be for your own good." During these interviews, Sans Souci would shed the bitterest tears she had ever shed in her life, and she would retire from them with her spirits depressed, and her powers of resistance much diminished. She tried and succeeded in winning the cordial sympathy and co-operatibn-'of Mrs. Waugh. Henrietta was the only friend and coadjutor she had in the house. Daily and hourly she risked the storm of the Commodore's wrath, by her silent, steady system of opposition to his views. She would constantly inter- vene-as a shield between him and poor Mary, between him and Jacqueliua, and between Jacquelina and Doctor Grimshaw. She resolutely expostulated with the Commodore about the cry- ing sin of ruining the whole life's happiness of a poor child-- one, especially, who had saved him from a horrible death by fire, at the imminent risk of her own life.

She seized the opportunity when he occupied the parlor alone. She went up to him, and saying that she wished to have a few moments of private conversation with him, she sat down by his side, and delicately approached the subject. She then spoke of the-general unsuitability of a marriage between himself and her niece. Doctor Grimshaw interrupted her by politely suggesting that he himself might be considered the best judge of that. Mrs. Waugh persisted in expressing her doubts upon that rery point. She spoke of the glaring disaparity of their re- 3pective ages and characters-her merry thoughts. Jacquelina, ihe said, could never make a proper and suitable companion or the grave and learned Professor Grimshaw. Doctor Grimshaw smiled, and thanking her for the question. Ible compliment, begged her to understand that he did not ,ven expect or wish to find in Miss L'Oiseau an intellectual ,ompanion-that in his library and among his brother pro- essors, he found sufficient of intellectual sympathy-that he 'ather disliled intellectual women, and never should dream of   CLIPPING   A  BIRD'S  WINGS s-   269^ selecting one for his wife-that in Miss L'Oiseau's delightful beauty and refreshing wit he sought only the necessary relaxa&amp; tion from graver thoughts and studies. "And she is no more intended for a pedant's toy than a sul- tan's slave!" exclaimed Henrietta, indignantly. "Dr. Grim- shaw, you have been intimate enough with this family, and deep enough in the Commodore's counsels to know exactly how this matter stands. You know Jacquelina's unconquerable repug- nance to this union, and you know the motives and influences that have been brought to bqar upon the child to compel her to receive you as a suitor. And knowing this, if you are the man of honor that I hope to find you, you will never permit yourself to be forced upon her acceptance !" "Madam, being sincerely attached to Miss L'Oiseau, and having her uncle's, your husband's, sanction for addressing her, you cannot very severely blame me for seeking to overcome the obstacles of the young lady's prejudices and dislike, and to win her regard." "Dr. Grimshaw, your specious words deceive you no more than they do myself. You are perfectly well aware that your suit to Jacquelina is unwelcome and distressing to the last de- gree-and if you have any manhood, not to say humanity, or dignity, or delicacy of character, you will immediately with- draw it." "Mrs. Waugh's' words are severe I and yet I am sorry I can- not oblige her in this particular matter 1" answered the Professor, bowing.  "And in that case, I shall be compelled to withdraw my con- fidence and esteem from Doctor Grimshaw !" "I shall be extremely grieved and mortified to lose Mrs. Waugh's good opinion," said the Professor, rising and bowing ironically; "there is indeed but one thing to console me for the want of it, and that is, the fair hand of her charming niece "  It was with difficulty Henrietta could abstain from saying, "In future, when Dr. Grimshaw honors this house with his 17  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7871-00000128"/> 270     THE    MS SING   BR I D-E. presence, he will do me a favor by not addressing one word of his conversation to me!" But she did restrain herself, and passed from the room to seek the presence of Mrs. L'Oiseau, in whom her last hope of saving Jacquelina rested. She found her in her chamber, where, even when not confined by weakness, she chose to remain, to keep out of sight and hearing of that terrible bug-bear, the Commodore. "Mary," said Mrs. Waugh, seating herself beside her, "I come to you to tell you that you must save your child from this hideous injustice I Only you can do it, and you must!" "Oh, dear! oh, blessed saints I what can I do? I'm sure my uncle frightens me almost to death with his threats?" You must not, through any fear of consequences to your- self, permit this great wrong to be done to your child I If you do, mind I tell you it will meet with a terrible retribution.

"Defend her from what? Dear me, it seems as if a good match were not such a bad thing. I believe you're all out of your senses, and you want to kill me with your scenes! What can Ido-poor, feeble, dependent creature that I am!" "What can you do!" exclaimed Henrietta, indignantly; "you can teach her by your example-by your courage and patience, to brave any fate rather than barter the integrity of her soul for ease and wealth! You can take her by the hafid and go forth into the wide world if necessary, to seek a home with strangers, or from charity! You can encourage her, :protect her, defend her; you can suffer with her, and for her- as God knows, if she were my child, I would, rather than see her so bitterly wronged 1". "Ohl -whined the sufferer, "'it is easy for you to talk-you,   C L IPPIN G  A BIRD'S   WN GS.   v 271 who haven't got it to do. We can all of us be patient or con. rageous or anything by proxy." "I would I stood in your place I I would do more than I have said I I would die with andfor my child, rather than see her left to so much misery!" "Oh, do go away Il You make me nervous and feverish! It is bad enough to have Unile lNick's abuse for not making her marry Grim', without having yours for- nt preventing her doing it. I am just between two fires. I do believe you mean to drive me crazy, between you 1" Once more upon this day an 'indignant scathing reply-arose to Mrs. Waugh's lips, and they burned to say, "Of all the cowardice and meanness in this world, that which hinders a mother from being just to her daughter certainly is the most loathly I There is no such thing in the brute creationl it is only to be found in lost human nature!"But again she bit her lips in silence, and arose and left the room. She found Jacque- lina in the passage, on her way to her mother's room. Mrs. Waugh motioned her in silence to go in. Now Henrietta cer- tainly thought she was entitled to the willful girl's gratitude for the interest she had taken, and the rebuffs she had received in her cause. Judge then of the good woman's surprise when, in the course of the evening, Jacquelina came in and roundly took her to task for lecturing her "Mmmy" into a fever. "She can't stand it, auntyl And if you waked and watched with her as I do every night, you'd know how bad her nights are!" "Oh  child-" begun Henrietta; but whatever she was about to say was drowned in tears, as she- covered her faceland wept.              / In an instant Jacquelina's arms were around her neckk.  "Auntyl- aunty! dear, good auntyt Idon't cry I what, are you crying about? Have I hurt your feelings? I never meant to 1" "No I no I little Lapwing I you didn't hurt my feelings.'

"Don't they, though.? Never mindl I'll pay them with compound interest I Now look here, aunty I stop this I if you keep on so, I shall go ramping mad I I know I shall I What do you. cry about me for?

You shall see fun alive at Locust Hill! So cheer up, aunty I or if you must cry, just cry for poor Grim'! it will be a charity!" As the decisive day approached, Jacquelina certainly acted like one distraught-now in wild defiance, now in paleness and tears, and anon in fitful mirth, or taunting threats. She rapidly lost flesh and color, and in hysterical laughter accounted for it by saying that she believed in her soul Grim' was a spiritual vampire, who preyed upon her life! She avoided him as much as she could. And if sometimes, when she was about to escape from him, he would seize her wrist and detain her, she would suddenly lose her breath, and turn so pale, that in the fear of her fainting, he would release -her. So he got no opportunity to press his claims. One morning, however--it was about a week before Christ- mas-she voluntarily sought his presence. She entered the parlor where he sat alone. Excitement had flushed her cheeks with a vivid crimson, and lighted her eyes with sparkling fire- she did not know that her beauty was enhanced a thousand fold -she did not know that never in her life bhad her presence kindled such aflame in the heart of her lover as it did at .that ,moment. And if he restrained himself from going to meet her, it was the dread lest she should fade away from him, as he had seen her do so often. But she advanced and stood before him. "Dr. Grimshawl! -she said, "I have come to make a last appeal to you!- I have come to beg, to supplicate you, for my   CLIPPING     A  BIRD'S  WINGS.   278 sake, for honor, for truth and for mercy's sake, yes I for heaven's sake, to withdraw your pretensions to my poor hand I For, sir, I do not and I can not like you I I do not say but that you are- far too good and wise, and every way too worthy for such a girl as I am-and that you do me the very greatest honor by your preference, but still no one can account for tastes-and, sir, I cannot like you-pray, pardon me! indeed, I cannot help- it." Although her words were so humble, her color was still heightened, and her eyes had a threatening defiant sparkle in them, so contradictory, so piquant and fascinating in contrast with the little fragile, graceful, helpless form, that his head was almost turned. It was with difficulty he could keep from snatching the fluttering, half defiant, half frightened, bird-like creature to his bosom. But he contentedhimself with saying, "My fairy we are commanded to love those that hate us,; and should you hate me, more than ever, I should only continue to love you!" "Love me at a distance, then! and the greater the distance, the more grateful I shall be-!" . He could no longer quite restrain himself. He seized her hand and drew her towards him, exclaiming, in an eager, breathless, half whisper, "  No! closer and closer shall my love draw us, beautiful one I until it compasses your hate and unites us forever 1  With a half suppressed cry, she wrung her hand from- his grasp, and answered wildly,            , ': "I sought your presence, to entreat you-and to warn you1 I have supplicated you, and you have turned %adeaf ear to mi: prayer I Now I warn you I and disregard my warning, if yo dare I despise it at your peril 1 I am going out of my wits, I think!

Angrily she snatched them from him. "What have I said? Oh I what have I said?

"Now how- am I expected to live with such a wife as this girl would make me? If it were not for the estate I should be tempted to give her up, and travel to forget her I How shall I overcome her repugnance? Not by courting her, that's de- monstrated! Only by being kind to her, and letting her alone" - Such was the tenor of his thoughts as he stood a little behind her chair out of her sight. But Jacquelina, when she found-herself free, soon recovered, and arose and left the room. Why prolong the struggle?-the sorrowful, ineffectual strug- gle of a captured bird against the net drawing around it. Grief and fear and anxiety were new experience to Sans Souci's sunny, buoyant nature, and most strange and startling was the effect upon her.

Until a day or two before Christmas, when, in the evening, she glided in to her uncle's room and sunk down, by his side--so unlike herself-so like a spirit-that the old sinner impulsively shrank away from her, and put out his hand to ring for lights.

"Not so mad as you think, uncle, either. I have come to make a bargain with you!" "What the foul fiend do you mean now? Do you want me   t to send you to Constantinople, pray?"

Without heeding the contradiction, except by a sly smile, Jacquelina went calmly on- "And Iknow that you wish to make me a stalking-horse, to convey the estate to Grimshaw, only because you cannot give it to himlin any other way but through his wife."   C LIPPING    A BIRD'S WINGS.     2" "What do you mean, you little diabolical- I It is my own -why can I not give it to whom I please, I should like to know?" "You can give it to any one in the world, uncle, except Dr. Grimshaw, or to one who bears the same relationship to yon that he does--for to such a one you may not legally bequeath your landed estate--or--" "You shocking, impudent little vixen I how dare you talkso?^ "Hear me out, uncle I I say, knowing such to be the case, I also know my own importance as a ' stalking-horse,' or sump- ter-mule, or something of the sort, to bear upon my own shoulders the burden of this estate, which you wish to give by me to Dr. Grimshaw. Therefore, I shall not give myself away for nothing. I intend to sell myself for a price! Nothing on earth would induce me to consent to marry Dr. Gxrimshaw, were it not to secure peace and comfort to my mother's latter days. Your threat of turning me out of doors would not compel me into such a marriage, for well I know that you would not ven- ture to put that threat into execution. But I cannot bear to see my poor mother suffer so much as she does while here, de- pendent upon your uncertain protection. You terrify and dis- tress her beyond her powers of endurance. You make the bread of dependence very, very bitter to her, indeed I And-well I know that she will certainly die, if she remains subjected to your powers of tormenting. I speak plainly to you, uncle, naving nothing to conceal; to proceed, I assure you I will not meet your views in marrying Dr. Grimshaw, unless it be to pur- chase for my poor mother a deliverance from bondage, and an independence for life.

Do you understand? Now, uncle I that is my ultimatum! For, please the heavens above usl come what may I do what you will I turn me and my mother out of doors, to freeze and starve! I will die, and see her die, before I will sell my hand for a less price than will make her independent and at ease for life! For, look you--I would rather see her dead, than leave her in your power! Think of this, uncle! There is time enough to-morrow and next day to make all the arrangements, only be sure I am in earnest Look in my face I Am I not in earnest?" "I think you are, you little wretch! I could shake the life out of you!" "That would be easy, uncle! There is not much to shake out! Only, in that case, you would have no stalking-horse to take the estate over to Dr. Grimshaw." And so saying, Jac- quelina arose to leave the room. "Come back here, you little vixen, you 1" Sans Souci returned. "It's well to ' strike white the iron's hot,' and to bind you while you're willing to be bound-for you are an uncertain little villain Though I don't believe you'd break a solemn pledge once given-hey 1"  "No, sir " "Pledge me your word of honor, now, that if I buy this little farm of Locust Hill, and settle it upon your mother, you will marry Doctor Grimshaw on this coming Christmas Eve?"

"I swear!" said Jacquelina. "Very well I Now, confound you, you may put the book back again, and go about your business." Sans Souci very willingly complied. And then, as she left the room and closed the door after her, her quick ear caught the sound of the Commodore's voice, chuckling, "So I've trapped you! Ten minutes more, and it would have been impossible."  Full of wonder as to what his words might mean, doubting also whether she had heard them aright, Jacquelina was hasting on towards her mother's room, when she met her aunt Henrietta, hurrying towards her, and speaking impetuously, "Oh, my little Lapwing, where have you been? I have been looking for you all over the house I Good news, dear Lapwing I Good news IDeliverance is at hand for you! Who do you think has come?" "Who?-who?" questioned Sans Souci, eagerly. "CLOUDY!" "Lost! lost!" cried the wretched girl, and, with a wild shriek that rang through all the house, she threw up her arms and fell forward to the ground. 5 ' *' 1  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7871-00000133"/> C[ A PTER   XXT.

WHEN Jacquelina recovered her senses, she found herself in her night-dress, lying upon her own white draperied bed. A dim fire was burning on the little hearth, and, by its fitful light, the room looked strange and ghostly-there was something weird even in the fat form of good Henrietta, as she stood by the bed holding the bottle of cologne water, and the saturated cambric handkerchief, with which she had just been bathing the poor girl's face and head. "What-what is all this about, aunty? Is anything the matter?"' asked Jacquelina, in a faint, uncertain voice. "Nothing but a little fainting fit you've had, Lapwingl They're not dangerous. Aunty's had more than one in her own time, strong as she looks now, and you are getting over it al- ready. Come smell this." "Ohl I know--I know now," said Sans Souci, as memory slowly returned. Aunty, will you go and send mother to me?" "I would rather not, my dear, She doesn't know that you fainted." "Don't tell her, then. Only say I'm tired and have gone to bed, and ask her to come,"  "I would much rather not, my dear. I want to have you all to myself to-night, to take care of you, and then to talk to you." "Oh I no, don't talk to me, aunty. Dear, best aunty that ever was in the world I Don't talk to me--they've all talked to me too much; my head can't bear it, I believe." "Honey I about Cloudy."

Mrs. Waugh got up unwillingly, and left the room to do as she was requested. And presently the door opened, and Mrs. L'Oiseau came in. Jacquelina's eyes were wide open, and, in, the shadow of her festooned curtains, seemed to shine like phosphorous., "Are you sick, my dear?" asked Mary, sitting down by her side. "No, mother, I don't know what I'm lying here for--oh, yes, I did what you told me-and-- where was I?" "What makes you tremble so, child?

"Life, is l--how queer Hisn't it?" Her eyes were shining like two stars, and the burning in- tensity of their gaze seemed to transfix the bosom of the weak woman, who had then urged her child to the very brink of mad- ness. She started up, and moving more quickly than she was accustomed to do, hastened to her own- chamber, and brought. back a restorative, which she forced her daughter to swallow, The cordial soon took effect, and the girl became quiet, and spoke collectedly.

"Oh, I don't know. My head is very weak-very weak. I am a very fragile creature, mother. But I am not unhappy ; that is a good thitlg, sure enough. I am nothing but a fay, mother; not half good enough for dearest Cloudy." "Now what do you talk about Cloudesley Mornington for? What has he to do with the subject on hand?" "Oh I I don't know, I'm sure; if I ever did, it has gone from my mind now."' "Try to compose yourself, my dear, and go to sleep."  "Sleep? Oh I I'm not sleepy I You are going to be inde- pendent, Mimmy, and I am going to be whirled away and away like a leaf on a stream, no matter where." Mrs. L'Oiseau thought it now best to keep silence, so she sat watching Jacquelina, as the poor, half-conscious girl lay there, letting her hand wander over the quilted figures on the Marseilles counterpane. Mrs. L90iseau said to herself, "This is only hysterical; this- is the worst pass, the crisis; let us be firm here-let her be pushed through this, and all the rest :ill be smooth; her life will settle down to the ordinary level of other lives; not happy, not miserable -will she be, but as others. Only one thing is certain, Cloudesley must not be permitted to come home -to this house, and I must see my uncle about that directly.'  A And so, while the poor girl-lay only half conscious, her mother went out and sought the presence of the Commodore, and gave him the warning.                4 "Oh I I know," he said. "Whojdo you think is a fool? I wrote to him this- very night to stay away." Vain was that letter I for the very hour that saw it start from the post-office at B , saw Cloudy, full of hope and joy, leave Norfolk for home.   A   GRIM  Mi A R I A E.     283 The next day Jacquelina was lying in bed, too weak to rise, when she heard a little bustle as of some sudden arrival below stairs-rising on her elbow she listened eagerly. Yes, it'was Cloudesley's voice, and she heard him ask eagerly, "Where is Lina?" "Here I herel dear Cloudy! Run up here I Quick I Quick, Cloudy," she cried vehemently,impetuously rising from the cloud of drapery around her, pale, wan, spiritual; not like Venus rising from the sea foam. And she heard his impatient, hasty step upon the stairs, as he ran up, and hurried in, and hurried to her bedside, exclaiming, "Sick. Lina?" But she rose up and threw herself upon his bosomt, even as she used to-do in infancy, and clasped her arms around his neck and burst into a passion of tears, clinging and sobbing, clinging and sobbing. "Jacquelina, my dear child, you must not do so I that is very wrong. My conscience' what will Doctor Grimshaw say? And your uncle? Jacquelina, don't do so!" said Mrs. L'Oiseau, coming around from the other side of the bed. But Jacquelina clung and wept, and felt Cloudesley's heart swelling, throbbing against her own. a"What-what is the matter?" asked Cloudy; in great per- plexity and trouble. "Why, she's engaged to be married to Doctor Grimshaw to-morrow'morning, and she ought not to do so!"t said Mrs. L'Oiseau. Cloudy grew very pale and compressed his lips, and tried to unclasp Jacquelina's arms, and force her off. But she clung. and wept; crying between her sobs, "Oh, Cloudy I let me I let me only this once! I'll. soon get done I and then, and then, never come again, Cloudy. Goodt-bye I Good-bye forever!" and her hands released their, hold, and she sunk back. And, without a word, Cloudy turned and left the room, and walked down stairs and took his hat,and, without saying good-bye to a single soul, left the house forever.,  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7871-00000135"/> 284     THE  MSSING   BRIDE. Jacquelina wildly stretched her arms towards her mother. "Oh, Mimmy, Mimmyl it was for your sake I did it- yours! 'Oh, Mimmy, hold me, hold me to keep my heart from breaking." Mrs. L'Oiseau came and sat down by her and took her hand, and began to talk to her, telling her that she was a good, duti- ful child, that she had acted nobly and disinterestedly, and that God would bless and prosper her. But Jacquelina shook her head. "No, mother, no ; what you say is not so. I have not done well; God, will not bless me. But oh, Mimmy, love me, love me a great deal or my heart will break; swathe it, bind it all around with your love, Mimmy, and keep it from breaking. But that's so selfish in me, too, for what will he do-poor fellow, who has no mother?" "Who, child, Grim'?" "' Grim'!' ha, ha, ha! no; had Grim' ever a mother?" "How you act, child. Here, take your rosary and say your prayers, it will compose your mind-" This heart! this heart!" 'a What are you talking of, child?" "To find out one has a heart first by its aching, Mimmy?" "It will go off soon, dear." "Yes! Will it?" And so-sometimes weeping, sometimes rambling in her mind, but never laughing, or defying, or threatening as before, Jacquelina passed the day and night. "This is the worst; push her through, rub her through this crisis, and she will then calm down and be resigned; people can't be happy in this sad world, bat let them learn content- ment as soon as they can," said Mary L'Oiseau to herself. And, "Only let her be once married to Grim', and d--dif I c&amp;re, said the Commodore to himself. The straggle was over.: Sans Souci felt it to be over, yet nothing like the quietude of despair fell upon her. The marriage was appointed to take place after matins, at nine o'clock, Christmas day, in the Catholic chapel.   A   G RIM  MARRIAGE.       285 That morning Jacquelina arose at eight from her restless couch, and suffered her mother to dress her in bridal array, to set the wreath of orange flowers on her golden ringlets, to arrange the lace veil at the back of her head, to draw on her tiny white gloves, all in silence.      -  "You don't speak a word to me, Jacquelina." "Because I'm so tired, Mimmy. Do you remember the man who swore he wouldn't get up and be hanged because he hadn't got his nap out? Well I now if I had not - to get up and be married, I had rather lie down and go to rest again." "You. talk such nonsense, child 1 but then you always did.' You haven't even asked who were to be your bridesmaids and groomsmen." "I had forgotten such attendants were necessary, Mimmry." "Yes, and I suppose if I had been as thoughtless as you there would have been none provided. However, they are down stairs, waiting to attend you to the altar. Come, my child. You are ready now, I believe, and the carriage is waiting-shall we go down?"  "Yes, Mimmy." "Mrs. L'Oiseau opened the door, and held it open in a fidgetty, impatient manner, but still Jacquelina lingered. "Come, my dear, come, what are you waiting for?" "Mother, not' one blessing-not one ' God speed' to me be- fore I go I Even the ghastly old judge says ' God have mercy on your soul' to the felon he sends out to be executed, though I never knew any one to thrive after such a benediction I But, mother, 'I have great need of blessing.?"

As soon as she reached the foot of the stairs, he took her hand, and pressing it, whispered, ', Sweet girl, forgive me this persistence l" "May God never forgive me if I do!" she fiercely exclaimed, transfixing him with a flashing glance I "But that is impiousl I love you so much, Jacquelina. -I shall devote my life to you I I will do anything on earth to make you happy!"

The groomsman followed with the bridesmaid. The Commodore and Mary L'Oiseau accompanied the party in a gig. Henrietta, true to her word, refused to be present at the marriage.  When the wedding party arrived at the chapel, all the -pews were filled to suffocation with the crowd that the rumor of the approaching marriage had drawn together. And the bridal party were the cynosure of many hundred eyes as they passed up- the aisle and stood before the altar. The bride and bridegroom knelt/ as is the custom in a Catholic solemnization of marriage. Jacquelina kept her eyes fixed upon the ground, and her lips firmly compressed. The ceremony proceeded, and only once, when the. usual question was put, whether any one there present knew any cause why these two should lot be joined in-holy wedlock, the bride slowly raised her head, and looked -fixedly in succession upon each member of her party, as wondering how, in God's awful presence, they dared to meet and disregard that solemn adjuration. The ceremony proceeded. But not one response, either verbally or mentally, did Jacquelina, make. The, priest passed over her silence, naturally ascribing it to bashfulness, and honestly taking her consent for granted,  The rites were finished, 'the benediction bestowed, and, friends and acquaintances left their pews, and crowded around with congratulations. Among the foremost was Thurston Willeoxen) whose suave and stately courtesy, and graceful bearing, and gracious words, so pleased Commodore Waugh that, knowing Jacquelina to be married and safe, he invited and urged the accomplis4ed- young "Parisian," as he was often called, to return and partake of; the Christmas wedding breakfast.

"It is a chosen spot of fertile land, As if it had by nature's cunning hand Bene choycely picked out from all the rest, And laid forth for ensample of the best."-nSperer.  IT should have been an enchanting home to which Thurston Willcoxen returned after his long sojourn in Europe. A few necessary words must introduce you to the ploe and its pro- prietor. The place, Dell-Delight, might on?,e have deserted its euphonious and charming name; now, however, its delightful- ness was as purely traditional as the royal lineage claimed by its owners. Yet it was a perfect piece of nature's handiwork:- A long, narrow dell, bounded on tiree sides by gently un- dulating hills, and sloping down to the bay on the fourth. The miansion-house, a square, massive edifice of white stone, with verandas running before every story, stood at the upper end of the dell. From the portico, you looked down a long vista, between the wooded hills that ended in two bold bluffs, between which, as through a portal, you caught sight of the flashing, glanciug waters of the bay. From the second story the view was still more extensive.       -  And from the balustraded walk on the roof, you could corn (291)   :  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7871-00000139"/> 292     THE   M ISSIN G  BRIDE mand the whole circumference of land and water, from the cen- tre to the horizon, and could feel that you really lived upon the surface of the great earth, in the immensity of space. Such is the effect in some positions of a little difference in v elevation. And in different moods of mind you might prefer the grand, inspiring view from the top, or the sweet, secluded, home-like, almost caressing aspect of the gentle hills, and the smile of the water caught between them. To the confined and wearied citizens both had been delightful. I In its palmy days the grounds of Dell-Delight had been beautifully laid out and adorned, and carefully kept up. But since coming into the hands -of the present proprietor, Cloudesley Willcoxen, everything not strictly useful in making or in saving money had been permitted to fall to decay, rather than preserved at the expense of a few hundred dollars. Yet old Mr. Willcoxen was not a miser, in the most repulsive sense of the word; he was only an excessively parsimonious utilitarian,  Time, money and labor, was the trinity he believed in and worshipped. And not a moment of time, a dollar of money, or a stroke of labor that could be devoted .to the increase of crops of tobacco for exportation, would he consent to see "thrown away" upon ornamental or landscape gardening;. Nay, even the culture of fruit trees, flowers, and kitchen vegetables, were neglected as things of minor importance. And Dell-Delight, in his hands, gradually assumed the most mournful and inharmonious of all aspects, that of prematurely ruined beauty. Mr. Willcoxen was one of those whose God is Mammon. He had inherited money, married a half-sister of Commodore Waugh for money, and made money. Year by year, from youth to age, adding thousands to thousands, acres to acres, until now, at the age of ninety-five, he was the master of incalculable riches. And all this wealth was strictly his own, to dispose of as he pleased. There was not even a foot of his landed estate entailed. He could devise the whole of it to whomsoever reason or ca- price might select as his heir.   DEL L-D E L I G H T.,      2 He had outlived his wife and their three children and his nearest of kin were Thurston Willcoxen, the son of his eldest son; Cloudesley Mornington, the son of his eldest daughter, and poor Fanny Laurie, the child of his youngest daughter. Thurston and Fanny had each inherited a small property in" dependent of their grandfather.      -  But poor Cloudy had been left an orphan in the worst sense of the word-destitute and dependent on the "cold charity of the world,?" or the colder and bitterer alms of unloving rich relatives. The oldest and nearest kinsman and natural guardian of the boys--old Mr. Willcoxen-had of course received them into his house to be reared and educated; but no education would he afford the lads beyond that dispensed by the village schoolmas- ter, who could very *well teach them that ten dimes make, a dol- lar, and ten dollars an eagle; and who could also instruct them how to write their own names-for instance, at the foot of re- ceipts of so many hundred dollars for so many hogsheads of tobacco; or to read other men's signatures, to wit, upon the backs of notes of hand payable at such a time, or on such a day. This was just knowledge enough, he said, to teach the boys how to make and save money, yet not enough to tempt them to spend it foolishy in travel, libraries, pictures, statues arbors, fountains, and such costly trumpery and expensive tom'M foolery.  To Thurston, who was his favorite, probably because he bore the family name and inherited some independent property, Mr. Willcoxen would, however, have afforded a more liberal and gentlemanly education, could he have done so and at the, same time decently withheld from  going to some expense in giving his penniless grandson, Cloudy, the same privilege. As it was, he sought to veil his parsimony by conservative principle. It was a great humiliation to the boys to see that, while all the youths of their own rank and neighborhood were - entered pensioners at the local college, they two alone were taken from 24* &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7871-00000140"/> THE  MSSING   BRIDE. the little day-school to be put to agricultural labor-a thing unprecedented in that locality at that time. When this matter was brought to the knowledge of Com- modore Waugh, as he strode up and down his hall, the in- dignant old sailor thumped his heavy stick upon the ground, thrust forward his great head, and swore furiously by the whole Pandemonial Hierarchy that his grandnephews should not be brought up like clodhoppers. And straightway he ordered his carriage, threw himself into it, and rode over to Charlotte Hall, where he entered the names of his two young relatives as pensioners at his own proper cost. This done, he ordered his coachman to take the road to Dell- Delight, where he had an interview with Mr. Willcoxen. And as he met little opposition from the old man, who seemed to think that it was no more than fair that the boys' uncle should share the expense of educating them-he sought out the youths, whom he found in the field, and bade them leave the plough, and go and prepare themselves to go to C and get educated, as befitted the grandnephews of a gentleman I The lads were at that 'time far too simple-minded and too clannish to feel their pride piqued at this offer, or to take of- fence at the rade manner in which it was made. Commodore Waugh was their granduncle, and therefore had a right to edu- cate them, and to be short with them, too, if he pleased. That was the way in which they also looked at the matter. And very much delighted and very grateful they were for the opening for education thus made for them. And very zealously they entered upon their academical stu- dies. They boarded at the college and roomed together,: But their vacations were spent apart,-Thurston spending his at Dell-Delight, and Cloudy his at Luckenough. When the academical course was completed, Commodore Waugh, as has been seen, was at some pains to give Cloudy a fair start in life, and for the first time condescended to use his influence with "the Department" to procure a favor in the shape of a midshipman's warrant for Cloudesley Mornington.   In the meantime, old Mr. Willcoxen was very gradually sinking into the imbecility natural to his advanced age; -and his fascinating grandson was gaining some ascendancy over his mind. Year by year this influence 'increased, though it must be admitted that Thurston's conquest over his grandfather's whims, was as slow as that of the Hollanders in-winning the land from the sea. However, the old man--now that Cloudy was provided for and off his hands, lent a more willing ear to the petition of Thurston to be permitted to continue his education by a course of studies at a German university, and afterwards by a tour of the Eastern continent. Thurston's'absence was prolonged much beyond the original intention, as has been related-he spent two years at the uni- versity, two in travel, and nearly two in the city of Paris. His grandfather would certainly never have consented to this prolonged absence, had it been at his own cost; but the ex- penses were met by advances upon Thurston's own small pa- trimony. And in fact, when -at last the young gentleman returned to his native country, it was because his property was nearly ex- hausted, and his remittances were small, few, and far between, grudgingly sent, and about to be stopped. Therefore nearly penniless, but perfectly free from the smallest debt or degrada- tion-elegant, accomplished, fastidious-yet truthful, generous, gallant and aspiring, Thurston left the elegant salooh and ex- citing scenes of Paris, for the comparative dullness and dreari- ness of his native place and his grandfather's house.  He had reached his legal majority just before leaving Paris. And soon after his arrival at home, he was appointed trustee of poor Fanny Laurie's property.  His first act was to visit Fanny in the distant asylum in which she was confined, and ascertain her real condition. And naving heard her pronounced incurable, though perfectly harm- less, he determined to release her from the confinement of the asylum, and to bring her home to her native county, where ,            \  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7871-00000141"/> 296     TIIlE MSSING   BRIDE. among the woods and hills and streams, she might find at once that freedom, space and solitude so desired by the heart-sick or brain-sick, and where also his own care might avail her. Old Mr. Willcoxen, far from offering opposition to this 0plan, actually favored it-though from the less worthy motive of economy. What was the use of'spending money to pay her board, and nursing, and medical attendance, in the asylum, when she might be boarded and nursed .and doctored so much cheaper at home? For the old man confideutly looked forward to the time when the poor, fragile, failing creature would sink into the grave, and Thurston would become her heir. 'And he calculated that every dollar they could save of her income, would be so much- added to the inheritance when Thurston should come into it. Very soon after Thurston's return home, his grandfather gave him to understand the conditions upon which he intended to make him his heir-they were two in number--viz., first, that Thurston should never leave him again while he lived- and secondly, ;that he should never marry without his consent. "For I don't wish to be left alone in my old age, my dear boy --nor do I wish to see you throw yourself away upon any girl whose fortune is less than the estate I intend to bequeath entire to yourself." ^ A                   .

IT was not fortunate for old Mr. Willcoxen's plans, that I grandson should have met Marian Mayfield. For, on the mor ing of Thurston's first meeting with the charming girl, when {i.   turned his horse's head from the arched gateway of Old Fie Cottage and galloped off, "a haunting shape and image ga attended him. It was that of beautiful Marian, with her blooming face ai sunny hair, and rounded roseate neck and bosom and arms, I softly, delicately flushed with the pure glow of rich, luxuria vitality, as she stood in the sunlight, under the arch of azu morning-glories, with her graceful arms raised in the act, binding up the vines.        .  That was the enchanting picture 1 And no slightest beau of it was lost or dimmed in memory-n-" glisten of the sun ra in the ripples of her golden bronze hair; no shadow of the ej lashes on her blushing cheeks; no curve of the fresh ripe lip no rise and fall of the rounded, glowing bosom; no motion the rosy arms, that was not like a breathing life before him. At first this " image fair" was almost unthought of--he w scarcely conscious of the haunting presence, or the life and lig it gradually diffused through his'whole being. And when tl revelation dawned upon his intellect, he smiled to himself, a, wondered if, for the first time, he was falling in love; and the ,e grew grave, and tried to banish the dangerous thought.

But soon, too soon, this bosom's sovereign became the despot, and tung, goaded and urged him to see again its living, breathing, flowing, most beautiful originall To seek her?-for what? He did not even try to answer the question. Thus passed one week. And then, had he been disposed to forget the beautiful girl, he could not have done so. J For everywhere where the busi- ness of his grandfather took him, around among the neighbor- ing planters, to the villages of B-- or of C--, everywhere he heard of Marian, and frequently he saw her, though at a distance, or under circumstances that made it impossible for him, without rudeness, to address her. He both saw and heard, of her in scenes and society where he could hardly have ex- pected to find a young girl of her insignificant position. . 'He made some very discreet and seemingly indifferent little inquiries about her, and adroitly led on others to speak of her. And from-'all he heard of her goodness, her disinterestedness, and her young wisdom blended with sweet and gracious joy-  v ousuess.       ; And, in truth, it is seldom that a creature so nearly faultless appears, or that in a world so given to envy and detraction as this, a yonng girl so beautiful and gifted as Marian wins such universal suffrages in her favor. The reasons might have been partly these: A stranger and a foreigner, without the advan- tages of wealth,family, or social position, in the most conser- vative and exclusive of all neighborhoods, her personal excel- lencies, without worldly distinctions, could not stand in the way of any one. She lived a very cheerful, busy, beneficent, and unexacting life, seldom leaving her little home except at the call of duty or benevolence. Truly those errands- often drew her forth, for Marian was eminently social and sympathetic. She   MARIAN,    THE   INSPIRER.     299 was the friend of everybody. Her sweetest earthly pleasure was the pure one of doing good, relieving pain, supplying want, comforting affliction, conferring benefits, and her highest earthly joy, approaching that of Heaven, was--tlze delight of delighting others! Both queen and priestess- she shouldehave been, by right of these instincts and capacities. These consti-. tuted her happiness, these gave her power and influence far beyond the sphere of her rank and sex and circumstances, and these, alas I finally contributed to work her lasting, bitter woe I And how much of her young life, her spirit's strength, she contrived to infuse into the apathetic community around her. There were several notable improvements commenced within, the last few years in the two villages and in the county,. These were day-schools for the children of the poor, and night-schools for young men otherwise employed during the day.   There were Sunday-schools. There were societies for relieving and improving the condition of the poor. And, finally, there was an annual fair for stimulating the, enterprize and emulation of farmers and housewives, and for rewarding excellence in, agri- culture, floriculture, gardening, and domestic economy in all its branches. And when Thurston learned the origin and history of these. new agents of progress that were gradually quickening the old, torpid community into life, and preparin its perfect resurrec- tion from the dead, he discovered, also that the beautiful afnd gifted Marian had been the Inspirerl  Strange, and passing strange, that a young girl, without for- tune, without family, without social distinction of any sort should, by the mere strength of heart and brain, the faculty of, much loving and great thinking, have attained such a spell over hearts and minds, a power that she used, as. she used all her advantages, for the good of humanity. And Thurston marvelled that one of such humble fortunes should have gained such an influence, and moved in such 'en, terprizes. "Humble fortunes!"Had Marian been a "crowned queend  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7871-00000143"/> 800     THE  'MSSING    BRIDE. she could not have felt or revealed a more natural, serene and' unobtrusive consciousness of personal power-a more habitual self-possession, self-reliance, and self-respect; and all this "self" Was without selfishness, as every act of her life proved, and this air and manner inspired perfect faith in those whom she wished to influence. When Thurston heard her spoken of, it was not with the mere admiration bestowed upon a beautiful girl, but with a cer- . tain esteem, deference, or enthusiastic endomium, according to the age or temperament of the speakers. She was scarcely twenty years of age, yet in the last three or four years had refused more eligible offers of marriage than any heiress in the county. Far the least notable among the rejected being Doctor Weismann, who, unknown to Miss Nancy, who kept him tied to her apron string, had made the offer of his heart,:hand, and professional prospects to the portionless girl. And the most important among them was the judge, of the county court, a grave, handsome man of middle age and con- siderable property, who sought to win the beautiful Marian through what he mis-judged to be her ruling passions, the love of power, and the power of patronage. He urged upon her the argument of how widely the sphere of her influence and useful- ness would be increased, when she should become the wife of a main of property and extensive connections. But, "No,"was Marian's laughing rejoinder; "I have observed that in this country, when a woman becomes the sole property of one man, she loses her influence with all the rest." "Then," said the judge, "for the sake of general usefulness, you purpose to live a single life." "Well, yes, I think so," answered Marian, "though I have taken no vows."  , Sound virgin heart was hers, that had never been trifled with, never -breathed upon byman's love--all declarations and pro- testations of the sort reached no farther than her ear. And Thurston knew that this rich, large heart, though often ,wooed, was still unwon. Did the dream of attempting its con-   MA-RIAN,   THE  INSPIREjR. quest epater his mind? Scarcely--certainly not to be willih entertained there; for .howeverhe might admire the enchaa 8girl, he durst not marry her.

How long this cool and cautious foresight might availhim, if once- he were brought in close companionship with Marian, remains to be seen. It happened one Sunday after- noon in October, that he saw Marian: take leave of her vener. able escort, Colonel Thornton, at the church-yard gate, and gayly and alone turn into the forest road that led to her own home. He immediately threw himself into his saddle and followed her, with theassumed air-of an indifferent gentleman pursuing his own path. He overtook her near one of those gates that frequently intersect the road. Bowing, he passed her, opened the gate and held it open for her passage. Marian smiled, and nodded with a pleasant, "Good afternoon, Mr. Willcoxen," as she went through. Thurston closed the gate and rode on after her. l-This is glorious weather, Miss Mayfield." "I Glorious, indeed!" replied Marian, turning her eyes from the gorgeous coloring of the autumn woods to the western sky, "where the rich sunset burned." "And the country, too, is perfectly beautiful at this season. I never could sympathize with the poets who call autumnal days ' the melancholy days-the saddest of the year.' "Nor I," said Marian; " for to me, -autumn, with its reful- gent skies and gorgeous woods and rich harvest and its pros- pect of Christmas cheer and wintry repose has ever seemed a gay and festive season. The year's great work is done, the harvest is gathered, enjoyment is present, and repose at hand." "In the world of society," said Thurston, " it is in the even- ing, after the labor or the business of the day is over, that the gayest scenes of festivity occur, just preceding the repose of sleep. So I receive your thought of the autumn-the evening of the year, preceding the rest of winter. Nature's year's work is done-she puts on her most gorgeous robes, and holds a festival before she sinks to her winter's sleep." Marian smiled brightly upon him. "Yes! my meaning, I believe, only more pointedly expressed." That smile l-that smile! It lightened-through all his nature   MA R IAN,  THE    INSPIRER.     8 with electric, life-giving, spirit-realizing power-elevating and inspiring his whole being--his face, too, was radiant with: life as he answered the maiden's smile. But something in his eyes caused Marian's glances to fall, and the rosy clouds to roll up over her cheeks and brow. Then Thurston governed his countenance-let no ardent or admiring glance escape, and when he spoke again, his manner and words were more deferential. "We spoke of the world of nature, Miss Mayfield, but how is it with the world of man? To many, nay, to most of the human race, autumn is the herald of a season, not of festivity and repose, but of -continued labor, and increased want and privation and suffering." "That is because society is not in harmony with nature-' man has wandered as far from nature as from God," said Marian.  "And as much needs a Saviour to lead hWim back to the one as to the other," replied Thurston. "You know that-you feel it," said Marian, turning upon him one of her soul-thrilling glances. Thurston trembled with delicious pleasure through all his frame, but guarding his eyes, lest again they should frighten off her inspiring glances, he. answered, fervently, "I know and feel it most profoupdly." And Thurston thought he spoke the very truth, though in sober fact he had never thought or felt anything about the sub- ject until now that Marian, his inspirer, poured her life-giving spirit into his soul. She spoke again, earnestly, ardently. "You know and feel it most profoundly H-That deep know- ledge and that deep feeling, is the chrism oil that has anointed you a messenger and a laborer in the cause of humanity.

He spoke with such sudden enthusiasm, such abandon, that ,it had -the effect of bringing Marian back to the moderation and retenue of her usual manner. He saw it in the changed expression of her countenance-and what light or shade of feel- ing passed over that beautiful face unmarked of him? When he spoke again it was composedly. "You speak as the preachers and teachers preach and teach -in general terms; be explicit; what would you have mea so do, Miss Mayfield? Only indicate my work, and tell me how to set about the accomplishment of it, and never knight served liege lady as I will serve you i" Marian smiled. "Nay, women can more readily set tasks to men, than in- struct them in the execution of the work. Yet, it seems to me that I can at least point out the scene of your labors-" "And that is-" "Here!P "Here l" "Aye, here, in your native place. No spot needs you so' much as this, to which you were given." "Pardon me, Miss Mayfield," he said, smiling in his turn, "but this place is so effete, so dead, so hopeless!" "Do you find it so? Why should that be?  The earth here, as elsewhere, looks to-day as young, as fresh, and as vigorous as if just turned from the hand of its Creator-finished, perfect.

I  would have all reformers and philanthropists, while preaching to grown people, not to forget the children, but to bring their truths to bear upon them as the seed; of promise." Marian ceased, and Thurston remained in thought for a few minutes; then he said, "I confess that, when I have dreamed of a useful and honors able career, the scene -of my visions has not ever been this obscure county." "You dreamed, perhaps, of acting in some of the world's' great thoroughfares?"  "Yes." And why?      Our Divine Master commenced his labors, not. among the great nations of the earth, but in His birth-place,-an obscure province. The Great Messfah appeared not at Rome: --at that day the great nucleus of the world's life and business -but in remote, effete, deadened Galilee. His humble fol- lower of to-day need not go to Washington, or New-York, to London, or Paris, or upon any of the world's great platforms. Let him light his lamp in his native place-for the people: among whom he was born-to whom he was sent-and, if the light be the true light, its rays will spread--never doubt-it." ^'rt;   Thurston smiled again; a curious, doubtful sort of -smile, which, 'had Marian seen it, would. not have inspired her with confidence. "So," he said, " the scene of my labor being fixed,. now for the manner of it.":  "Oh!" said Marian, laughing, and parodying the- words: of Portia, 'I could easier teach twenty what were good to; be done, than show one of the twenty how to followl my aown, fach- ing.' But, first, I think you should endeavor to-purify andi elevate the tone of thought and feeling in the communirty."' "But how?"

"Again-how?"  "How? Oh  you must-make yourself a position from which to influence them, I do not know that I can advise you how; but you will find a wayl As-were I a man, Ishould!" "Being a woman, y-u have done wonders." "For a woman," said Marian, with a glance fuill of archness and merriment. "No; no, for any one,man or woman. But your method, Marian? I beg your pardon, Miss Mayfield," he added, with a blush of ingenuous embarrassment. "Nay, now," said the frank girl, "do call me Marian if that name springs more readily to your lips than the other. Almost all persons call me Marian, and I like it," A rush of pleasure thrilled all through his veins-lie gave her words a meaning and a value for himself, that they did not certainly possess; he forgot that the grace extended to him was extended to all-nay, that she had even-said as much in the very words that gave it. He answered, "And if I do, fairest Marian, shall I too, hear my own Chris- tian name in music from your lips?" "Oh I I do not know," said the beautiful girl, laughing and blushing, "if it ever comes naturally, perhaps, certainly not * now. Why, the venerable Colonel Thornton calls me 'Marian, but it never comes to me to call him 'John ' " Thurston's rapture suddenly fell to zero. He rode on in silence. "Come,"' said Marian, gayly, " let us return to what we were talking of-younwere inquiring'" "What your method-your system of action has been, in gaining and wielding an influence that has resulted in so much lod, Miss Mayfield?"He would not now call her "Marian," he would Boc accept that privilege when shared by Colonel Thornton, or any other man alive.   MARIAN,   THE   INSPIRER.     3( "My method-my system? I had none," said Marian, "but the history of what has been done is briefly this: The evils of your community are perhaps much more apparent in a strangert especially to a European coming here with exaggerated ideas of what the ' model republic' is, or ought to be, than -to a native resident. And,therefore, I confessthat I was astonished, shocked, to find in any part of democratic America, a preva- lence and tyranny of rank so absolute and offensive as that which exists here-greater, I take it upon me to say, than can be found in any part of England. No less was I grieved and disappointed to find a class of poor white people, living ina semi-barbarous state, in mean and miserable huts, no better than wigwams, supporting themselves by hunting, fishing, thiev- ing, and working a little in harvest time ; so ignorant as to be unable to'read, and so 'degraded as to be despised and con- temned even by the negro slaves. Their condition touched my- heart, and weighed upon my mind. I spoke of it-when, and where, and how, and to whom, the Spirit dictated. I obeyed my inspirations, nothing more I My daily life brought me into close and favorable relations with the country people. I often, when I least expected it, found myself in the position of nurse, friend, sympathiser, and even counsellor. What I had to say was spoken in homes where I had been useful, and so earned a hearing, or by the sick beds of convalescents, whom I had nursed back to life. And so, my words were listened to with great kindness and indulgence, and, after much perseverance on my part, with effect." "I do not wonder, Miss Mayfield, at your power over minds and hearts."' They had now. reached the verge of the forest, and 'came out into the open country that lay between that and the coast. And here their roads naturally separated--Old Field Cottage standing about a quarter of a mile up, andDell-Delight four ' i five miles down the bay.

Forthwith he put this plan in execution. But though he stayed and stayed-and breakfast was pre- pared and eaten, and the service cleared away-and his excuse for staying ceased, and his continued presence seemed like intru- sion, still the object of his visit was not obtained-beautiful Marian did not appear. I hope Miss Mayfield is quite well," he said, at last, as re- lucta ntly he arose to go. "Oh, yes, quite well, Marian is never otherwise, but she went last night to sit up with a sick neighbor, and I scarcely expect to see her home to-day." This was a heart-sickening disappointment-especially as he felt that this game manceuvre could not be resorted to again- its air of incidentality would thus be lost. And he knew that Old Field Cottage was a place at once so well known, and so little frequented, that his visits there, upon any pretext, would, in that gossipping neighborhood, occasion remarks and specu- lations that would assuredly be carried to the knowledge of his jealous, watchful, argus-eyed grandfather, and be likely-not only to interfere with even his accidental interviews with the, beautiful, penniless girl, but also very seriously with his future prospects. He bade adieu to Edith, with an anxious headrf anid a busy brain, all alive with eagerness to contrive accidental meetings with Marian. But though fertile in expedients, he was not fortina'te in re- sults. It was in vain that he frequented B and O   ,i and the roads between those villages and Old Field Cottage, i$ never, by any chance, caught sight of Marian.

"O  E. "All thoughts, all passions, all delights, Whatever stir this mortal frame Are but the ministers of love, And feed his sacred flame."-Coleridge. THURSTON WILLCOXEN'S usual road from Dell-Delight to the village church, brought him nowhere within miles of Marian Mayfield's forest path from Old Field Cottage to the same point. But upon this particular Sunday, Thurston chose to make an early start from home, and ride full five miles up the shore to the cross roads, on the edge of the forest, where he had parted from Marian the Sabbath previous. He reached the spot while the early autumnal frost yet embossed the earth and the trees with pearls-and the latest lingering summer birds twittered their morning carols. It was but nine o'clock when he entered the forest-it was but an hour's ride to church, and he fully believed himself to be a half or three-quarters of an hour in advance of the young girl. Therefore he rode slowly up and down the forest path, frequently turning upon his course, until about thirty minutes had passed. Then he began to grow vigilant in eye and ear to catch the sight or sound of her distant approach. But nothing was heard save the twitter of the robins, the gurgle of low rills, the rustle of dried leaves driven by the breeze, or the fali of a solitary nut as it dropped to the ground, besides the lonely step of his own steed. And he might have paced to and fro for a whole day, for many days, and heard no other sound but these, hthe wind and the rain-so lonely was this forest walk. Three quarters of an hour passed, and he began to grow very impatient, and wonder at her non-appearance, and the longer (310)   I   "OVE.        3"   the delayed appearing, the surer he grew of seeing her the very next instant-it must be so, for Marian was never absent from church, and never late in attendance, and she never went by any other road than this--therefore, of course, she must now sud- denly come in sight. She came not, however. And vexed and sick at heart with frequent disappointments, Thurston, galloped back on his road quite to the verge of the forest, and looked upon the country and the heaving sea, now all glorious in the morning light, and his eye roved for miles up and down the coast, but no human being or even beast of burden was in sight upon the lonely scene. The only sign of human habitation, in fact, was "the smoke that so gracefully curled" from the grove of trees that surrounded Old' Field Cottage in the far distance. Half-past ten o'clock He now knew that Marian would not come. What could be the reason? Was she sick? No I Ma- rian was never sick  Suddenly it occurred to him that she muSt have stayed the whole week at the house of the neighbor whom she went to nurse. That would also account for his missing her all the week. And doubtless from that neighbor's house she had gone to church by another road. : ^No sooner had this explanation of her non-appearance occurred to him than he turned and spurred on his horse towards the church, hoping to see her there. He knew that he should be very late, but that would be nothing, if only he could see that one longed-for face. He galloped on at the top of his speed and reached the vil- lage, and entered the church just before the preacher took his text. He did not hear the text-his whole attention was fixed upon Marian. Yes! there she sat! With her beautiful blooming. face turned up towards the preacher, in devout attention ait seeming unconsciousness of the presence of another soul in ti- church, The sermon proceeded, and not one moment did her atten-  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7871-00000149"/> THE  MSSING' BRIDE. tion wander, ond not one word of the discourse did Thurston hear, his eyes, his thoughts being completely occupied by the beautiful object of his love. The sermon came to an end.-.the closing prayer, the hymn and the benediction followed, and the-congregation began to disperse, and pour down the aisles. 'Marian was taken up and whirled away from him in the crowd.  He could not, without' rudeness, elbow his way among a mass made up so largely of women and children, and so he had to wait his time and follow on slowly in the rear. He got out and reached the open churchyard and the fresh air. But then he had the mortification of seeing Marian placed in her saddle by a very liandsome young man) who instantly threw himself into another saddle, and rode on to attend her. -Devouring his own heart in chagrin, Thurston stood looking after them as they rode on towards the forest path; one minute swearing mentally that he did not care a cent to make a third in such a party, antd the next feeling the dog-in-the-manger im- pulse, since he himself could not woo, to mar the wooing of another. But then how could he, without worse than Vandalie barbarism, force himself into their company? Well, at any rate, he would; he resolved, ride down that path, and bow to them as he passed. He could tell, by their faces, he thought, what the meaning of the escort might be. That he hadl a right to do-a right that could be exercised with perfect propriety. No sooner thought of than done. Hee sprung into his saddle and galloped after them. He overtook them a short distance in the forest. One keen' glance in passing he shot into their faces; the countenance of the young man was flushed, eager, impassion'ate,. and bent towards Marian. The expressiot of the young girl was blushing, down cast, distressed, embarrassed. Those mutual looksg set Thurs- sn's blood boiling with jealousy. He: could have hurled his rival from the saddle, and trampled him under foot I t was. with. the greatest difficulty that he could restrain his: passon   I    "OVE.     383   and govern himself. But he did so--effectually, bowing haugh- tily as he passed them. But Marian's voice recalled him. "Mr. Willcoxen." He turned around and looked. Marian's face was full of blushing embarrassment and bashful entreaty-her companion's was clouded with disappointment and vexation. Thurston rode back. "Well, Miss Mayfield, I am at your orders.' "I have a number of things to say to you, Mr. Willcoxen, and a number of questions to ask. But first, you are acquaited with Mr. Barnwell?" "Yes," bowing coldly. "Ride near, then.," Thurston now smiled, and went on the right side of Marian, where he continued to ride, in silence, waiting for the young girl to speak. But Marian either had forgotten what she wihed to say, or else was taking a long time to arrange it. They rode on in moody silence until they reached a gate, which Thurston opened for Marian to pass through. Here Mr. Barnwell suddenly stopped, lifted his hat, and say- ing, gloomily and angrily, that he feared he had trespassed to- long upon Miss Mayfield's society and indulgence, begged leave to apologize for his intrusion, and to wish her a very good morning. And so saying, he bowed, turned, and rode back to the village. When they were left alone, the embarrassment on either ide increased. "You were very early at church to-day, Miss Mayfield," said Thurston, by way of saying something, "Yes," smiled Marian, "but I could not well be otherwise than early, since I was there from eight o'clock in the morning,' So soon                .     -  "You know-or perhaps you do not know that I have a class in the Sunday school."  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7871-00000150"/> 814     THEE  MSSING   BRIDE. "Idiot that I was to forget that!" thought Thurston, as the sudden light broke on him, showing that while he was cooling his feet and warming his temper by pacing up and down St. Mary's forest, in expectation of seeing her, she was already safely housed with her class in the Sunday school. No matter I He secretly swore to be more alert on the next Sabbath morning. "But I cannot compliment you upon the same ground, Mr. Willcoxen," said Marian, both gravely and sweetly; "you were late at Divine service." A thrill of delight electrified Thurston's nerves. He was "Iate"--she had noticed it-she, whose attention seldom wan- dered from her prayer-book or her minister's face-she had no- ticed his absence--she had waited for his appearance, perhaps impatiently, longingly as he had waited for her in the woods. So with love's sophistry he reasoned as he heard her words, and an impetuoustide of emotion rushed through all his veins and flushed his face I Forgetting, his discreet caution, forget- ting that their meetings were to seem incidental-or not caring to use that subterfuge with her alone--losing his usual self- possession, he pressed towards her, exclaiming, passionately, and half reproachfully, "Marian, I have much to say to you-I have lived over many times the scene of last Sabbath evening. I have sought you everywhere, during the whole week, with no other result than heart-sickening disappointmenffrom day to day I Marian, 'why did you inspire and then avoid me?" Surprised at his words, and confused by his manner, Marian averted her eyes, as a vivid blush rose mantling cheek and brow. "I have offended you," said the young man, sorrowfully. "No," said the maiden, "only astonished me." "Wherefore, Marian? wherefore? That I should have sought you again with my whole heart and soul in the search?" he asked earnestly, ardently-pressing towards her. Her spirited -little horse shied angrily, throwing up its head. She became more and more confused and embarrassed. Her face was still averted-and the blush burned like fire on her cheek.   "O V.           i "Marian," he said, dropping his' voice to the very depths of tenderness; '.'Marian, give me your hand, in token'of forgive- ness. I know that I have been rash 'and presumptuous; that I have no right so suddenly to speak of feelings that have not, however, arisen suddenly, fairest girl, but -have had possession of my whole nature, -heart, soul and spirit, for months past-- that have filled and fired and consumed me-like a fever or a madness! Forgive me, Marian; I will control myself--I will not shock or wound you again-give me your hand in token of pardon, and tell me you will not avoid me." With her face still averted, and her cheek still burning, the maiden held out her hand, saying softly, "I was not offended, as I told you before, only surprised that you should have imagined I had avoided you; when there was no earthly reason to do so, that I know of." He carried her hand respectfully to his lips. He felt the un- intentional reproach of her candor and honesty. He covered his feelings of compunction by saying, "Strange-most strange, that I could not find you, when 1 sought you so eagerly." "I was at home all the week," said Marian, "except on Monday." "I called at Old Field Cottage upon that very day, unfortu. nately." "So Edith told me, but she did-not tell me that the visit was to me-she thought your coming partly accidental." "Well," said Thurston, as a blush of honest shame mantled his brow--"it was partly so-I had been out shooting, And  i passing close to Old Field Cottage, saw Mrs. Shields at the -:- / door--thought my morning's spoils might not be unacceptable, : and tired and hungry, accepted her invitation to breakfas t.

She withdrew her hand -and turned away her head, though without anger. "Let us speak," she said, "of the subject we were discussing last Sabbath evening." "As you will, fairest Marian; I have already taken some steps towards entering upon your service, my liege lady," he answered, with a manner perfectly respectful, but so pointed that the maiden, dropping her eyes, said- l"Not nmyhumble service, good sir, but the higher one of your fellow citizens." There was a pause. "You do not ask me, Marian, what these first steps have been. You are perhaps no longer interested in them." "It is not considered polite to ask questions," said Marian, archly; " nevertheless, I am waiting anxiously to hear.? "It is not much that I have accomplished. When one feels within oneself, inspirations and energies capable of accomplish- ing great things, it is disheartening to see what poor tools we have to work with, and what poor materials to, operate upon- with what small, slow steps we approach our object." "The river is filled from small springs, and the mountain grows by accretion. Al reforms have started with one man, and its victories have been single converts, few and far between." How difficult to gaze upon the beautiful, eloquent face, the clear, blue eye, soft with feeling and radiant with light, the roseate cheek and sunny, rippling hair, the glowing lips, smiling and speaking; and not bow down before her beauty; and not give utterance to the passion, throbbing, burning in his bosom 1 How hard to keep down the rising heart I How hard to ride and talk of social ethics when he only wished to fold that glowing form to his bosom'!

He     "OVE.        31S   wished that the fair girl and himself had been only walking, or  sitting down somewhere on some bank or fallen tree. He longed to throw himself at her feet, to clasp her hands, to pour out before her the flood of passion that was swelling in his bosom I To entreat her to forget her wisdom, and her philoso- phy, and influence, and to remember that she was a beautiful girl, the most charming and the most beloved in the world, and, to beseech her to hear him, to bless him, to let him lead her into the Eden of love. Gazing on her enchanting beaut, he was, in imagination, far away in that Eden already. f: She recalled him, her calm, sweet voice coming coolly across all that heat and turbulence of passion and imagination. "You have not yet told me, Mr. Willcoxen, of the nature of the steps you have taken towards a commencement." Thurston frowned and smiled slightly as he said, "They are so trifling, so inefficient, that I hesitate to tell you." "They may seem trifling, but of their efficiency we musttake time to judge."  "Well, you shall hear, and then you shall judge," said Thurston, guarding his offending glances as well as he could. "I have offered myself to the Board of Directors to give a free course of lectures at C Academy. A lecture is to be deliv- ered every Monday evening, and the lecture room to be thrown open to the public. The course will embrace a review of history, political economy, social philosophy7 education, the progress of society, and lastly a comparative view of the present state of civilized nations." "Excellent!" exclaimed Marian, smiling upon him. "And you call this trivial? Pray, sir, were you thinking of doing something superhuman, that you depreciate this?" Thurston gayly answered her smile, and then said, "I have sketched out quite a wide field-of labor, which will  - take me the whole winter to cover; but my doubt is, whether I can do anything like justice to the subjects, or whether, if I do, I shall find any sort of favor with my audience, or any sort of good fruits will come of the seed thus sown.'" 20 &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7871-00000152"/> 318     THE  MSSING- BRIDE.

Then she added, "Your plan is- very good--your course, if you do it justice, will be a complete course of instruction and enlighten. ment for thhese people; and under one or another of your heads, you can speak any new thought,. teach any new truth, that you 'please to utter, or they need to hear. But when do these lectures begin?" "To-morrow evening the introductory discourse, a retrospect of history, is to be delivered. If you had been anywhere else than shut up in Old- Field Cottage, you would have seen the affair announced. And yet, fair inspirer I so debarred have I been from your presence, and so anxious have I felt to find you, that not one preparatory note have I made for that lecture to be given to-morrow."

"I believe so, as our homes lie in opposite directions." "Heaven grant that? it may not long be sol" fervently ejacu- lated the young gentleman.

"Anid you, dearest Marian?" "I shall be very happy to see, and converse with one who has the heart to labor earnestly and gratuitously, in the cause of education and reform;" said the maiden, in a low, soft voice. "Thank you, fairest and dearest; I shall find my way to Old Fields." "Once more-good day, Mr. Willcoxen," she said--turning once again to ride homeward.

What then was his surprise and joy when riding through the forest on Friday morning, to meet Marian returning from-the village and on foot. She was ra- diant with- health and beauty, and blushing and smiling with - joy, as she met him. , A little basket hung upon her arm. To dismount and join her, to take the basket from her arm, and look in her face and declare in broken exclamations his delight at seeing her, were the words and the work of an instant. "And whither away, this morning, fairest Marian?" he in- quired, when unrebuked he had pressed her hand to his lips, and  drawn it through his arm. "I have been to the village, and am now going home," said the maiden.  "It is a long walk through the forest." "Yes, but--my pony has cast a shoe and lamed himself slightly, and I fear I shall have to dispense with his services for -a few days '- '" "Thank God " fervently ejaculated Thurston to himself. "But it is beautiful weather, and I enjoy walking," said the young girl. "'Marian-dearest Marian, -will you let me attend you home - The walk is- lonely, and it may not be quite safe for a fair woman to take it unattended." 'I have no fears of interruption," said Marian. :fi. et, you will not refuse to, let met attend-- you? Do not, Marian!" he pleaded, earnestly, fervently, clasping her hand, land pouring the whole strength of his soul in the gaze that he fastened on her face. "I thank you-but you were riding the other way." "It was merely an idle saunter, -to help to kill- the time -be-       ,       -      r    O.

I will-be with you again in fifteen minutes;, in the meantime here is something for you. to look at," he said, drawing from his pocket'an elegant little volume bound in purple and gold, and laying it in her lap. -He then smiled, sprang into his saddle, bowed, and galloped away leaving Marian to examine her book. It was a London copy of Spenser's Fairy Queen, superbly illustrated; one of the rarest books to be found in the whole country, at that day. On the fly-leaf, the name of Marian was written, in the hand of  Thurston.  Some minutes- passed in the pleasing examination of the volume-and Marian was still turning the leaves with unmixed pleasure-pleasure in the gift, and pleasure in the giver--when Thurston, even before the appointed time, suddenly rejoined her. "So absorbed in Spenser, that you did not even hear or see me!" said the young man, half reproachfully. "I was indeed far gone in Fairy Land I Oh I I thank you so much for your beautiful present. It is, indeed, a treasure. -I shall prize it greatly," said Marian, in-unfeigned delight. "Do you know that Fairy Land is not obsolete, dearest Marian?" he said, fixing his eyes upon her charming face, with an ardor and earnestness that caused hers to sink. . "Come," she said, in a low voice--;and rising from the rock "Iet us leave this place and go forward." . They walked on, speaking softly of many things, of the lec- tures, of- the beautiful autumnal weather, of Spensert: of any- thing except the one interest that now occupied -both hearts. The fear of startling her bashful trust,'and banishing- those be- witching glances that sometimes lightened on his face, made him cautious, and restrained his eagerness.; .while excessive consciousness kept her cheeks dyed with .blushes, and- her nerves vibrating sweet, wild music, like the strings of some eodiau harp when swept by the swift south wind. He determined, during the walk, to plead his love, and ascer-  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7871-00000157"/> THE  MSSING   B RIDE. tain its fate. Aye! but how approach the subject, when, at every ardent glance or tone, her face, her heart, shrunk and closed up, like the leaves of the sensitive plant. So they rambled on, discovering new beauties in nature; now it would be merely an oak leaf of rare richness of coloring; now some tiny insect with finished elegance of form; now a piece of the dried branch of a tree that Thurston picked up, to bid her note the delicately blending shades in its gray hue, or the curves and lines of grace in its twisted form-the beauty of its slow return to dust; and now perhaps it would be the mingled colors in the heaps of dried leaves drifted at the foot of some great tree. And then from the minute loveliness of nature's sweet, small things, their eyes would wander to the great glory of the au- tumnal sky, or the variegated array of the gorgeous forest. Thurston knew a beautiful glade, not far distant, to the left of their path, from which there was a very fine view that he wished to show his companion. And he led Marian thither by a little moss bordered, descending path. It was a natural opening in the forest, from which, down a still, descending vista, between the trees, could be seen the dis- tant bay, and the open country near it, all glowing under a refulgent sky, and hazy with the golden mist of Indian Summer. Before them the upper branches of the nearest trees formed a natural arch above the picture.  Marian stood and gazed upon the wondrous beauty of the scene with soft, steady eyes, with lips breathlessly severed, in perfect silence and growing emotion. "This pleases you,'" said Thurston. She nodded, without removing her gaze. "You find it charming?" She nodded again, and smiled. "You were never here before." "Never." "Marian, you are a lover of nature." "I do not know," she said, softly, "whether it be love, or   FOREST   WAL KS.        329 worship, or both; but some pictures spell-bind me. I stand amidst a scene like this enchanted, until my soul has absorbed as much of its beauty and glory and wisdom as it can give.

She turned her eloquent eyes full upon him. He forgot his prudence, forgot her claims, forgot everything, and caught and strained her to his bosom, pressing passionate kisses upon her lips, and the next instant he was kneeling at her feet, imploring her to forgive him-to hear him I Marian stood with her face bowed and hidden in her hands, but above the tips of her fingers, her forehead, crimsoned, might be seen. One half her auburn hair had escaped and rippled down upon her bosom in glittering disorder. And so she stood a few moments. But soon, removing her hands and turning away, she said, in a troubled tone, "Rise. Never kneel to any creature-that homage is due the Creator alone-oh I rise." "First pardon me, first hear me, beloved girl." "Oh I rise--rise, I beg you. I cannot bear to see a man on his knee, except in prayer to God,".she said, walking away. He sprang up and followed her, took her hand, and with gentle compulsion, made her sit down upon a bank, and then he sank beside her, exclaiming eagerly, vehemently, yet in a low, half smothered tone, "Marian, I love you. I never spoke these words to woman before; for I never loved before. Marian, the first moment that I saw you I loved you, without knowing what new life it was that had kindled in my nature.

"I do not deserve to be loved in that way, I do not wish it, for it is wrong-idolatrous,' she said, in a low, tremblingsvoice. "Oh, what do you mean:t Is the love upon which my life seems to hang so offensive to you?. Say, Marian 1 ; Oh I you are compassionate by nature-how can you keep me in the torture of suspense?V1 "I do not keep you so."' "You will let me love you?" -Marian slipped her hand iii his-that was her reply. "You will love me?" For all answer she gently pressed his fingers. He pressed her hand to his heart-to his lips-covering it with kisses. u' Yet, oh I speak to me, dearest; let me hear from you lips that you love me-a little--but better than I deserve. Will you? Say, Marian. Speak, dearest girl."  "I cannot tell you now," she said, in a low, thrilling tone. Ad I am disturbed-wish to grow quiet-and must go home. Let us return." :One more passionate kiss of the hand he clasped, and then he helped her to her feet, drew her -arm within his own, and led her up the moss-covered rocks that formed the natural steps of the ascent that led to the homeward path. They were now near the verge of the forest, which, when they reached, Marian drew her arm from his, and extending her hand, said, "This is the place our roads part." "But you will let me attend you home?" "No -it would make the return walk too long." That can -be no consideration. I beg you will let me go with you, Marian.1" "No--it- would not be convenient to Edith to-day," said Marian, quickly drawing her hand from his detaining grasp, waving mhim adieu, and walking swiftly away across the meadow.

She hastened to the cottage, laid off! her bonnet and shawl, and set herself at work as dili- gently as usual; but a higher bloom glowed on her cheek, a softer, brighter light beamed in her eye, a warmer, sweeter smile hovered around her lips, a deeper, richer tone thrilled in her Toice.

His praises were still the theme of the aged as well as the youthful. In the wealth of golden opinions he was fully Marian's equal. On Sunday morning the lovers " chanced" to meet again-- for so Thurston would still- have had it appear as he permitted Marian to overtake him in the forest on her way to the Sunday- school. She was blooming and beautiful as the morning itself as she approached. He turned with a radiant smile to greet her. "Welcome I thrice welcome, dearest one! your coming is more joyous than that of day. Welcome my own, dear Marian I May I now call you mine! Have I rend that angel-smile aright? Is it the blessed herald of a happy answer to my prayer?" he whispered, as he took her hand and passed his arm around her head, and brought it down upon his bosom. "Speak, my Marian I Speak, my beloved I Are you my own, as I am yours?" Her answer was so low-toned that he had to bend his head down close to her lips to hear her murmur- "I love you dearly: But I love too well to ruin your pros- pects. You must not bind yourself to me just yet, dear Thurs- ton," and meekly and gently she sought to slip from his embrace. But he slid his arm around her lightly, bending his head and whispering eagerly,  "What mean .you, Marian? Your words are incomprehen- siblei, "Dear Thurston," she answered, in a tremulous and thrilling voice; "I have known your grandfather long by report, and I am well aware of his character and disposition and habits. ;But only yesterday I chanced to learn from one who was well informed, that old Mr. Willcoxen had sworn to make you his heir only upon condition of your finding a bride of equal -or superior fortunes. If now you were to engage yourself to me, your grandfather would disinherit- you. I love you too well," she murmured very low, " to ruin your fortunes. You must not bind yourself to me just now, Thurston."   FOREST   WALKS.. --33 And this loving, frank, and generous creature was .the Wo- man, he thought, whose good name he would have periled in a clandestine courtship, in preference to losing his inheritance by an open betrothal. A stab of compunction pierced his bosom, ; he felt that he loved her more than ever, but passion was stronger than affection, stronger than conscience, stronger than anything in nature, except pride and ambition. -He tightened his clasp about her waist-he bent and whispered, "Beloved Marian, is it to bind me only that you hesitate" "Only that," she answered softly. "Now hear me, Marian.

But, dearestfgirl, it is more difficult to get a reply from you, than from a prime minister. Answer, now, once for all, sweet girl I since I am forever bound to you; will you pledge yourself to become my own dear wife?" "Yes," whispered Marian, very lowly. - "And will you," he -asked, gathering her form closer to his bosom, "' will you redeem that pledge when I demand it?" "Yes," she murmured sweetly," so that it is not to harm you, or bring you into trouble or poverty; for that I would not consent to do!" "God bless you; you are an angel I Oh I Marian i I find it in my heart to sigh because I am so unworthy of you 1" And this was spoken most sincerely. 'You think too well of me. I fear-I fear for the conse. quences."-  "Why, dearest Marian?" "Oh, I fear that when you know me better you may love me less," she answered, in a trembling voice. "Why should I?" "Oh! because your love may have been attracted by ideal qualities, with which you yourself have invested me; and when  your eyes are opened you may love me less." "May my soul forever perish the day that I cease \toss love you!" said Thurstone passionately .pressing 'her to his- heart, and sealing his fearful oath upon her pure brow and guileless lips.

"Nay, I will lay them at your feet or lose- them altogether for you!" "A truce to vain words, dear Thurston.

I confess, that I am very sensitive to those things-so sensitive, that had I known you would have been in the woods to-day, I should have taken some other road to church." "You would?" "Yes, indeed, I would!" "I shall remember that!" thought he. "I must hasten onward, to be in time for my class in the Sunday school.

"Have you so misapprehended me 1" she said, sadly. -"Listen to me, dear Thurston.

And as for yourself, you are of age, and should have the same freedom, under the same condition of right doing. Your grandfather's -attempt to compel your choice of a wealthy bride before a loved one, I consider an unjustifiable stretch of authority.

And do you see that I would do no wrong?'1 "Would it be wrong to give a little of your company, in a seaside stroll, to me, to whom you have just plighted your faith?" "Yes," said Marian, gravely, "it would be wrong." "Which of the commandments of God, fair saint, would it break?" "None, perhaps, from beginning to end, yet my conscience assures me that it would be wrong. ' All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient,' says St. Paul."' "Aye, beautiful theologian I but hear what Paul's Master said-' Be not righteous over much.'

Thurston, dear Thurston." She- raised her eyes to his as she spoke, and giving way to a sudden impulse, dropped her head upon his shoulder, put her arms around his neck, and embraced him. And then his better angel rose above the storm of passion that was surging through his veins, and calmed the tumult, and spoke through his lips. "You are right, Marian-fairest and dearest, you are right. And I not only love you best of all women, but honor you more than all men., It shall be as you have said. I will not seek you anywhere. As the mother, dying of plague, de- nies herself the parting embrace of her 'unstricken' child-- so, for your sake, will I -refrain from the heaven of your pre- sence." "And, dear Thurston," she said, raising her head, "it will not be so hard to bear, as- you now think. We shall see each other every Sunday, in the church, and every Monday in the lecture-room. We shall often be of the same invited company at neighbor's houses. Remember, also, that Christmas is coming, with its protracted festivities, when we shall see each other almost every evening, at some little neighborhood gather- ing. And now I must really hurry; oh! how late I am this morning I Good-bye, dearest Thurston!" "Good-bye, my own Marian."      ' Blushingly she received his parting kiss, and hurried along the little foot-path leading to the village. He had no farther opportunity of speaking with Marian that day. And when the afternoon service was over, Miss Thorn- ton, -the sister of Colonel Thornton, having discovered that Marian had walked to church, offered her a seat in her carriage, and made a little detour on her way home, in order to set her down at Old Field Cottage. The next evening, at the lecture- room, Thurston saw Marian again, and again drew strength and inspiration from her presence. But when the lecture was closed, she was among the first, to depart. And he failed in his en- deavor to get near and speak to her   FOREST    WALKS.        3 Thurston had been perfectly sincere in his resolution not to seek a private interview with Marian; and he kept it faithfully all the week, with less temptation to break it, because he did not know where to watch for her, But Sunday came again-and Thurston, with a little bit of human self-deception and finesse, avoided the forest path, where he had met her the preceding Sabbath, and saying to himself, that he would not waylay her, took the river road, refusing to confess even to himself that he acted upon the calculation that she also would take the same road, in order to avoid meeting him in the forest. His "calculus of probabilities" had not failed him. He had not walked far upon the forest shaded banks of the river, before he saw Marian walking before him. He hastened and over- took her. At first seeing him, her face flushed radiant with surprise and joy. She seemed to think that nothing short of necromancy could have conjured him to that spot. Sfe had no reproaches for him, because she had no suspicion that he had trifled with his promise not to seek her. But she expressed her astonish- ment. "I did not know you ever came this way," she said. "Nor did I ever before, love; but I remembered my pledge, not to follow or to seek you, and- so I avoided the woodland path where we met last Sunday," said Thurston, persuading himself that he spoke the precise truth. It is not necessary to pursue with them this walk; lovers scarcely thank us for such intrusions. It is sufficient-to says that this was not the last one. Blinded by passion and self-deception, and acting upon the same astute calculus of probabilities, Thurston often contrived to meet Marian in places where his presence might be least ex- pected, and most often in paths that she had taken for the ex- press purpose of keeping out of his way. Thus it fell, that many forest walks and seashore strolls were taken, all through the lovely Indian Summer weather. And   &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7871-00000163"/> 3840     THE   M S SING BRIDE. these seemed so much the result of pure accident, that Marian never dreamed of complaining that his pledge had been tam- pered with. But Thurston began to urge her consent to a private mar. riage. From a secret engagement to a secret marriage, the transition seemed to him very easy. "And, dearest Marian, we are both of age, both free--we should neither displease God nor wrong man, by such a step- while it would at the same time secure our union, and save us from injustice and oppression I do you not see?" Such was his argument, which he pleaded and enforced with all the powers of passion and eloquence. In vain. Though every interview increased his power over the maiden-though her affections and her will were both subjected, the domain of conscience was unconquered. And Marian still answered, "Though a secret marriage would break no law of God or man, nor positively wrong any human creature, yet it might be the cause of misunderstanding and suspicion-and perhaps calumny, causing much distress to those who love and respect me. Therefore it would be wrong. And I must do no wrong, even for your dear sake." Alas, Marianl   The only way to have prevented all the wrong and misery, would have been to break off at once. If there is any reason on earth why two who love as lovers cannot marry, let the wrench come that parts them forever; it may be passing bitter-terrible-but it is better than' the long heart- wasting of any other course. So, through all the glorious autumnal weather, and through all the golden, hazy Indian Summer, their walks were continued -'through the deep forest, by the lonely sea-shore, over the sunny hills,'down the shady dells-the woods, the streams, the fields, their only confidants. At last the weather changed--the gloomy skies and heavy rains of early winter came on, and the same inclement season that confined Commodore Waugh's obstreperous violence within   FOREST     WALKS.         341 the four walls of his bed-chamber, and put a temporary stop to the works at Luckenough, also interrupted the perilous pleasure of those woodland and water-side -rambles. Even the lectures failed to draw people through the rain-anc mud of December, and the church itself was thinly attended. Thurston was faithfully at his post each Monday evening though there might be no one but the professors, college boys and villagers for his audience. He was also an indefatigable attendant upon chutrch, in the hope of seeing Marian. But she did not appear either at church or lecture, and Thurston in veighed against the continued bad weather, and fell into gloom and despondency, from which neither the quaint pranks and wild caroling of Fanny, nor the near approach of Merry Christmas could for a moment arouse him. As Christmas ap proached, the weather became still worse-from  inclement i became tempestuous. The rain changed to snow--and th- snow-storm raged three days. CHAPTER XXpI CLOUDY.

Thurston was the sole and surly occupant of the sitting-room, where he had thrown himself at full length upon the sofa, to lie and yawn over the newspaper, which he vowed was as stale as last year's almanac. Suddenly the front door was thrown open, and some one came, followed by the driving wind and snow, into the hall. Thurston threw aside his paper,' started up, and went out. What was his surprise to see Cloudesley Mornington standing there, with a face so haggard, with eyes so wild and despairing, that, in alarm, he exclaimed, "Good Heaven, Cloudesley. What is the matter? Has anything happened at home?" "Home I home  What home?  I have no home upon this earth now, and never shall have!" exclaimed the poor youth distractedly. "My dear fellow, never speak so despondently. What is it now? a difficulty with the Commodore?" "God's judgment light upon him!" cried Cloudy, pushing past and hurrying up the stairs.  "' I never was a favorite--my uncle never smiled on me with half the fondness that blessed the other child,' yet I would not have cursed him so,"l said Thurston, as he returned to the sitting-room, threw himself down upon the settee and took up his newspaper. / But he could not resume his former composure; something in Cloudy's face had left a feeling of uneasiness in his mind, and the oftener he recalled the expression the more troubled he became. Until at length he could bear the, anxiety no longer, and quietly leaving his room, he went up stairs in search of the youth, and paused before the boy's door.

With one vigorous blow of his heel, Thurston burst open the door, and sprung forward and dashed the fatal weapon from his hand, and then confronted him, exclaiming, "Good God, Cloudy I What does this mean?" Cloudy looked at him wildly for a minute, and when Thurston repeated the question, he answered with a hollow laugh, "That I am crazy, I guess! don't you think so?" "Cloudy, my dear fellow, we have been like brothers all our lives; now wont you tell me what has brought you to this pass? What trpuble so you so much? Perhaps- I can aid you in some way. Come, what is it now?" "And you really don't know what it is? Don't you know that there is a wedding on hand?" "A wedding!" "Aye, man alive I A wedding! They are going to marry the child Jacquelina, who is scarcely out of her short frocks and pantalettes, to old Grimshaw." "Oh, yes, I know that; but, my dear boy, what of it? Surely you were never in love-with little Jacko?" "In love with her I ha ha! no, not as you understand it I who take it to be that fantastical passion that may be inspired by the first sight of a pretty face. No I I am not in love with her, unless I could be in love withhmyself. For Lina was my other self. Oh, you who can talk so glibly of being 'in love,' little know that strength of attachment when two hearts have grown together from childhood." "It is like a bwther's and a sister's." "Never I brothers and sisters cannot love so. What brother ever loved a sister as I have loved Lina from our infancy. What brother ever would have done and suffered as much for his sister as I have for Lina?" "You I done and suffered for Lina!" said Thurston, begin- ning to think he was really mad.   &#xD;<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7871-00000165"/> 844     THE  MSSIN G   BRIDE.

"And the little lady grew silent and thin, Paling, and ever paling, As is the way with a hid chagrin, And they all perceived she was ailing."-Browning. SINCE the morning of her ill-starred marriage, Sans Souci had waned like a waning moon; and the bridegroom saw, with dismay, his fairy bride slowly fading, passing, vanishing from his sight. There was no very marked disorder, no visible or tangible symptoms to guide the physicians, who were in suc- cession summoned to her relief. Very obscure is the pathology of a wasting heart, very occult the scientific knowledge that can :search out the secret sickness, which, the farther it is sought, shrinks the deeper from sight: Once, indeed, while she was sitting with her aunt and uncle, the latter suddenly and rudely mentioned Cloudy's name, say- ing that " the fool " was sulking over at Dell-Delight; that he believed he would have blown his brains out if it had not been for Thurston, and for his own part, he almost wished that he had been permitted to do so, because he thought none but a fool would ever commit suicide, and the fewer fools there were in the world the better, &amp;c. &amp;c.- His monologue was suddenly arrested by Henrietta's rushing forward to lift up Sans Souci, who had turned very pale, and dropped from her seat to the floor, where she lay silently quivering and gasping, like some poor wounded and dying bird. They tacitly resolved, from this time forth, never to name Cloudy in her presence again. And the Commodore struck his heavy stick upon the floor, and emphatically thanked God that Nace Grimshaw. had not been present to witness her agitation and its cause. ' (346)   t HE FAIRY    B RID .  And Jacquelina waned and waned. And the physicians, wearied out with her case, prescribed "Change of air and- scene-pleasant company--cheerful amusement-excitement," &amp;c. A winter in Washington was suggested. And the' little invalid was consulted as to her wishes upon the subject. "Yes." Jacquelina said she would go-anywhere, if only her aunty and Marian would go with her-she wanted Marian. Mrs. Waugh readily consented to accompany her favorite, and also to try to induce "Hebe," as she called blooming  Marian, to make one of their party. And the very first day that the weather and the roads would admit of traveling, Mrs. Waugh rode over to Old Fields, to - see Marian, and talk with her about the contemplated journey. T The proposition took the young lady by surprise;, there were ? several little lets and hindrances to her immediate acceptance of the invitation, which might, however, be disposed of ; and, i finally, Marian begged a day to consider of it. With this  answer, Mrs. Waugh was forced to be content, and she took  her leave, saying, "Remember, Hebe! that I think your society and conver- sation more needful, and likely to be -more beneficial to poor Lapwing, than anything else we can procure for her; therefore, pray decide to go with us, ifpossible." , Marian deprecated such reliance upon her imperfect abilities, but expressed her strong desire to do all the good she possibly could effect for the invalid, and made little doubt ;but that she should at the least be able to attend her. So, with this hope, h Mrs. Waugh kissed her and departed. The very truth was, that Marian wished to see and- consult  her betrothed before consenting to leave home for what seemed-  to her to be so longa journey, and forso long a period. - In fact, ? Marian was not now a free- agent; she had suffered her free! will to slip from her own possession into that of Thurston. She had not seen him all the wretched weather, andher heart i now yearned for his presence.

There was no certainty that she should see Thurston; still she hoped to do so, nor was her hope disappointed. He overtook her a short distance from the village, on her': road home.  Their meeting was a very glad one-heart sprang to heart a nd hand to hand--and neither affected to conceal the pleasure that it gave them. After the first joyous greetings, and the first earnest and affectionate inquiries about each other's health :hd welfare, both became grave and silent for a little while. Marian was reflecting how to propose to leave him for a -three months' visit to the gay capitol, little thinking that Thurston himself was perplexed with the question of how to break to her the news of the necessity of his own immediate departure to England for an absence of at least six or eight months. Marian spoke first. "Dear Thurston, I have something to propose to you, that I fear you will not like very well; but if you do not, speak freely; for I am not bound." "I do not understand you, love I Pray explain at once," said he, quick to-take alarm where she was concerned. "You know poor 'little Jacquelina has fallen into very bad health and spirits? Well, her physicians recommend change of air and scene, and her friends have decided to take her to Washington to pass the remainder of the winter. And the little creature has set her sickly fancy upon having me to go with her. Now, I think it in some sort a duty to go, and I would not willingly refuse.  Nevertheless, dear Thurston, I dread to leave you, and if you think you will be very lonesome this winter without me--if you are likely to miss me one-half as much as I  have missed you these last three weeks, I will not leave you at all." He put his hand out and took hers, and pressed it, and would have carried it to his lips, but her wicked little pony suddenly jerked away.

It was now Marian's turn to change color, and falter in her tones, as she asked, "You-you are not going away?" 'Sweet Marian, yes I A duty-a necessity too imperative to be denied, summons me." She kept her eyes fixed on his face in painful anxiety. "I will explain. You have heard, dear' Marian, that after my father's death my mother married a second time?" 'i No-I never heard of it." "She did, however--her second husband was a Scotchman.

A plague upon these horses that keep us so far apartl I wish we were on foot 1" "Do you?" smiled Marian, directing his attention to the sloppy path down which they were riding. Thurston smiled ruefully, and then sighed. "When do you set out on your long journey, dear Thurston?" I have not fixed the time, my Marian! I have not the courage to name the day that shall part us for so long." He looked at her with a heavy sigh, and then added, "I shrink from appointing the time of going, as a criminal might shrink from giving the signal for his own execution." "Then let some other agent do it," said Marian, smiling at his earnestness. Then she added-"I shall go to Washington with Jacquelina. Her party will set out on Wednesday next. And, dear Thurston, I shall not like to leave you here, at all. I shall go with more content, if I know that you set out the same day for your journey." "But, fairest Marian, never believe but that if you go to Washington, I shall take that city in my way. There is a vessel to sail on the first of February, from Baltimore, for Liverpool. I shall probably go by her. I shall pass through Washington City on my way to Baltimore. Nay indeed! what should hin- der me from joining your party and traveling with you, since we are friends and neighbors, and go at the same time, from the same neighborhood, by the same road, to the same place?" he asked, eagerly. A smile of joy illumined Marian's face. "Truly," she answered, after a short pause, "I see no objec- tion to that plan. And, oh I Thurston," she said, holding out her hand, and looking at him with her face holy and beaming with affection, "do you know what fullness of life and comiubo -what sweetness of rest and contentment I feel in your pre- sence, when I can have that rightly?" "My own dear Marian I Heaven hasten the day when we shall be forever, united." And he suddenly sprang from his horse-lifted her from her   TH-E  PAIRY   BRIDE.       351 saddle, and holding her carefully above the sloppy path, folded her fondly to his bosom, pressed kisses on her lips, and then replaced her, saying, "Dear Marian, forgive me! My heart was half breaking with its need to press you to itself I Now then, dearest, I shall consider it settled that I join your party to Washington. I shall call at Locust Hill and see Mrs. Waugh, inform her of my destination, and ask her permission to accompany her. By the way-when do you give your answer to that lady?" "I shall ride over to the Hill to-morrow morning, for that purpose." "Very well, dearest. In that case I will also appoint the morning as my time of calling; so that I may have the joy of meeting you there." They had by this time reached the verge of the forest and the cross-road where their paths divided. And here they bade a loving, lingering adieu to each other, and separated. That evening Marian announced to Edith her decision to accompany Jacquelina to Washington City. Edith approved the plan. The next morning, Marian left the house to go to Locust Hill, where, besides the family, she found Thurston already awaiting her. Thurston was seated by Jacquelina, endeavoring, by his gay and brilliant sallies of wit and humor, to charm away the sullen sadness of the pale and petulant little beauty. And,truth to tell, soon fitful, fleeting smiles broke over the little wan face--smiles that grew brighter and more frequent as she noticed the surly anxiety they gave to Doctor Grimshaw, who sat, like the dog in the manger, watching Thurston sunning himself in the light of eyes that never by any chance shone upon him, their rightful proprietor I Never I for though Jacquelina had paled and waned, failed and faded, until she seemed more like a moonlight phantom than a form of flesh and blood-her spirit was unbowed, un- broken, and she had kept her oath of uncompromising enmity  &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7871-00000169"/> 852     THaE MSSING   BRIDE. with featful perseverance. Petitions, expostulations, prayers, threats, had been all in vain to procure one smile, one word, one glance of compliance or forgiveness. And the fate of Doctor Grimshaw, with his unwon bride, was like that of Tantalus. And now the inconceivable tortures of jealousy were about to be added to his other torments, for this man now sitting by his side, and basking in the sunshine of her smiles, was the all- praised Adonis who had won her maiden admiration months ago. But Thurston soon put an end to his sufferings-not in con- sideration of his feelings, but because the young gentleman could not afford to lose or risk the chance of making one of the party which was to number Marian among its members. There-  fore, with a light smile and careless bow, he left the side of  Jacquelina and crossed over to Mrs. Waugh, with whom, also,  be entered into a gay and bantering conversation, in the course i of which, Mrs. Waugh mentioned to him their purpose of going to Washington for a month or two. It was then that, with an air of impromptu, Thurston in- formed her of his own contemplated journey and voyage, and of his intention to go to Baltimore by way of Washington. 'And when do you leave here?" asked Mrs. Waugh. "I thought of starting on Wednesday morning." "The very day that we shall set out-why can't we travel in  company?" asked Henrietta, socially. - "! should be charmed indeed-delighted! And nothing  shall prevent me having that honor and pleasure, if Mrs. Waugh  will permit my attendance."  "Why, my dear Thurston, to be sure I will-but don't waste  fine speeches on your uncle's old wife. How do you travel?" "As far as Washington I shall go on horseback, with a mounted groom to bring back the horses, when I proceed on my journey byo stage to'Baltimore." "On horseback I Now that is excellent-that is really pro- aidential, as it falls out-for here is my Hebe, whom I have coaxed to be of the party, and who will have to perform the journey also on horseback, and you will make an admirable cavalier for her 1"   THE  FAIRY. BRIDE.        35 Thurston turned and. bowed to Marian, and expressed, in courtly terms, the honor she would confer, and the pleasure she would give, in permitting him to serve her. And no one, to have seen him, would have dreamed that the subject had ever before been mentioned between them. Marian blushed and smiled, and expressing her thanks, ac- cepted his offered escort. These preliminaries being settled, Thurston soon after arose and took leave. Marian remained some time longer to arrange some little pre- paratory matters with Mrs. Waugh, and then bade them good- bye, and hastened homeward. But she saw Thurston walking his horse up and down the forest-path, and impatiently waiting for her. Doctor Grimshaw was very much dissatisfied; and no sooner had Marian left the house, and left him alone with Mrs. Waugh and Jacquelina, than he turned to the elder lady, and said, with some asperity, "I think it would have been well, Mrs. Waugh, if you had consulted the other members of your party before making so important an addition to it. "And I think it would be better, Doctor Grimshaw, if you would occupy your valuable time and attention with affairs that fall more immediately within your own province," said Henrietta, loftily, as she would sometimes speakr.-  Doctor Grimshaw deigned no reply. He closed his mouth with a spasmodic snap, and sat ruminating-the-very picture of- wretchedness. He was indeed to be pitied I For no patience; no kindness, no wooing could win from his bride one smile.

But not all her arguments, entreaties, or even tears, could prevail with the obstinate bride to relax one single degree of. her unforgiving antagonism to her detested bridegroom. "Mother," she said, with sorrowful bitterness, "you are well now; indeed you never was so ill as I was led to believe: and you are independent. I parted with my only hope of happi- ness in life to render you so; I sold myself, in a formal marriage, to be the legal medium of endowing Doctor Grimshaw with a certain landed estate. ]Even into that measure I was deceived- no more of that I it crazes meal The conditions are all fulfilled: he will have the property, and you are independent.

"His forbearance I Oh I hasn't he been forbearing though!" she exclaimed, with a mocking laugh. "Yes I he has, little as you are disposed to acknowledge it.

"Mimmy!" she said, with a wild laugh, "is there a deeper pit in perdition than that to which you urge me now?" Fortune certainly favored the lovers that day; for when Thurston reached home in the evening, his grandfather said to him, 'Well, Mr. Jackanapes, since you are to sail from the port of Baltimore, I think it altogether best that you should take a private conveyance, and go by way of Washington." "That will be a very lonesome manner of traveling, sir," an- swered the young man, demurely. It will be a very cheap one, you mean, and therefore will not befit you, Sir Millionaire! - It will cost nothing, and there- fore lose its only charm for you, my Lord Spendthrift," cried the miser, sharply.        t "On the contrary, sir, I only object to the loneliness of the long journey."

THE   A I RY   BRIDE.       357 "And mind, take care that you are not led into any waste of money." "I shall take care, sir." And here Thurston's heart was gladdened within him. He profoundly thanked his stars.

For, under the circumstances, what gentleman could leave a lady of his party to travel wearily on horseback, while himself and his servant rode cosily at ease in a gig? What gentleman would not rather give the lady his seat in the gig- take the reins himself and drive her, while his servant took her z saddle-horse? So thought Thurston. Yet he did not hint the subject to his grandfather-the, methodf of their -traveling should seem the impromptu effect of chance. The next morning being Sunday, We threw himself in Marian's path, waited for her, and rode with her a part of the way to church. Apd while they were in company, he told her of the new arrangement in the manner of traveling, that good fortune had enabled him to make-that if she would so honor and delight him, he should have her in, the gig by his side for the whole journey.. He was so happy, so very happy in the thought, he said. "And so am I, dearest Thurston I very, very happy in the idea of being with you. Thank God!" said the warm-hearted girl, offering her hand, which he took and covered with kisses. Thurston's good fortune was not over. His star was still in the ascendant, for after the morning service, while the congre- gatiou were leaving the church, he saw Mrs. Waugh beckon him to her side. He quickly, obeyed the summons. And then the lady said, "I may not see you again soon, Thurston, and' therefore I tell you now--that if you intend to join our party to Washing. -  &#xD;<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7871-00000172"/> 858     THE  MSSINO    BRIDE. ton, you must make all your arrangements to come over to Locust Hill'on Tuesday evening, and spend the night with us ; as we start at a very early hour on Wednesday morning, and should not like to be kept waiting. My Hebe is also coming on Tuesday evening, to stay all night. Now, not a word, Thurston. I know what dilatory folks young people are. And I know very well that if I don't make sure of you on Tuesday evening, you will keep us a full hour beyond our time on Wednesday morning-you know you will." Thurston was secretly delighted. To spend the evening with Marian I to spend the night under the same roof with her-- preparatory to their social journey in the morning. Thurston began to think that herwas born under a lucky planet. He laughingly assured Mrs. Waugh that he had not the slightest intention or wish to dispute her commands; and that on Tues- day evening he should present himself punctually at the supper- table at Locust Hill. He further informed her that as his grandfather had most arbitrarily forced upon him the use of his new gig, he should bring it, and offer Miss Mayfield a seat. It was now Mrs. Waugh's turn to be delighted, and to declare that she was very glad-that it would be so much easier and pleasanter to her Helte, than the cold, exposed, and fatiguing equestrian manner of traveling. "But mind, young gentleman, you are not to make love to my Hebe for we all think her'far too good for mortal man 1" laughed Mrs. Waugh. Thurston gravely promised that he would not--if he could help it. And so, with mutual good feeling, they shook hands aiid separated. On Monday evening, at his farewell lecture, Thurston met Marian again, and joyfully announced to her the invitation that Mrs. Waugh had extended to him. And the maiden's delight- ful smile assured him of her full sympathy with his gladness. And on Tuesday evening, the swole party for Washington was assembled around the tea-table at Locust' Hill. The even- ing passed very cheerily. The Commodore, Mrs. Waugh,   THE   BRIDE   OF AN HO  UR.   8359 Marian, and Thurston, were all in excellent spirits. And Thurston, out of pare good nature, sought to cheer and enliven the pretty, peevish bride, Jacquelina, who, out of caprice, affecte  d a pleasure in his attentions that she was very far from feeling. This gave so much umbrage to Doctor Grimshaw, that Mrs. Waugh really feared some unpleasant demonstration from the grim bridegroom, and seized the first quiet opportu- nity of saying to the young gentleman, !"Do, Thurston, leave Lapwing alone 1 Don't you see that that maniac is as jealous as a Turk?" "Oh  he -is!" thought Thurston, benevolently. "Very well in that case his jealousy shall not starve for want of aliment ;" and he devoted himself to the capricious bride with more smpressement than before-consoling himself for his dis- creet neglect of Marian, by reflecting on the blessed morrow that should place her at his side for the whole day. And so the evening passed; and at an early hour the party separated to get a good long night's rest, preparatory to their early start in the morning. But Thurston, for one, was too happy, to sleep for some time: too happy in the novel blessedness of resting under the same roof with his own beautiful and dearest Marian. and d   Mara CHAPTER   XX Vll.

The cunning fox, the 'possum and4 the 'coon, crept shivering from their dens; but the shy, gray rabbit, and the tiny, brown wood-mouse, still nestled in their holes. And none of nature's small children ventured from their nests, save the hardy and courageous little snow birds that came to seek their food even at the very threshold of their natural enemy-man. The approaching sun had scarcely as yet reddened the eastern horizon, or'flushed the snow, when at Locust Hill our travelers assembled in the dinning-room, to partake of their last meal previous to setting forth. Commodore Waugh, and Mrs. L'Oiseau, who were fated to remain at home and keep house, were also there to see the travelers off. The fine vitalizing air of the winter morning, the cheerful bustle preparatory to their departure, the novelty of the break- fast eaten by candle-light, all combined to raise and exhilarate the spirits of the party. After the merry, hasty meal was over, Mrs. Waugh, in her voluminous cloth cloak, fur tippet, muff, and wadded hood; Jacquelina, enveloped in -several fine, soft shawls, and wearing a warm, chinchilla bonnet; and Dr. Grimshaw, in his dread- naught overcoat and cloak, and long-eared fur cap, all entered tOe large family carriage, where, with the additional provision of foot-stoves and hot bricks, they had every prospect of a com- fortable mode of conveyance. Old Oliver, in his many-caped drab overcoat, and fox-skin cap and gloves, sat upon the coachman's box with the proud air of a king upon his throne. And why not? It was Oliver's very first visit to the city, and the suit of clothes he wore was bran new! Thurston's new gig was furnished with two fine buffalo robes --one laid down on the seats and the floor as a carpet, and the other laid over as a coverlet. His forethought had also pro- vided a foot-stove for Marian. And never was a happier man than he-when he handed his smiling companion into the gig.   THE  BBID  OI    AN HOA  U .    361. settled her comfortably in her seat, placed the foot stove under her feet, sprang in and seated himself beside her, tucked the buffalo robe carefully in, and took the reins, and waited .the signal to m ove on. M  elchisedek, or as he was commonly called, Cheesy" mounted upon M  arian's pony, rode on in adv ane, to open the gate] for the:party. Mrs. W augh's carriage followed. And Thurston's gig brought up the rear. And thus the travelers set forth. The sun had now risen in cloudless splendor, and was strik- ing long lines of crimson light across the snow, and piercing through the forest aisles. Flocks of saucy little snow-birds alighted fearlessly in their path; but the cunning little gray rabbits just peeped with their round bright eyes, and then quickly hopped away . I need not describe their merry Journey at length. My readers will readily imagine how delightful was the trip to at least two of the party. And those two were not Dr. Grimshaw. and Jacquelina.             s ever in all his life had Thurston felt so joyousl A never had his Marian seemed so lovely. There are some beautiful faces which the cold mars. Of such was not bloom- ing Marian's. Pier warm rich blood and fine elastic tempera- ment glowed and rebounded against the chillihg and depressing action of the frost. And -the only effect of the sharp, fresh, winter morning air upon her splendid organization was highly vitalizing and exhilarating, kindling a more vivid glow on het cheeks and lips, and a more splendid light in her clear blue eyes. Thurston waspositively more in love than ever,'though that could scarcely seem possible. And he used the oppor- - tunity thus afforded him to press his suit for a private marriage. He prayed and entreated with all the power that passion can give to eloquence. In vainl Marian: was firrm, "firm as an iceberg, Thurston said, reproachfilly. He used the same ar- guments that she had answered before. "Dearest Marian, you are of age., You have neither parent nor guardian, nor even patron or benefactor, to whom you owe  &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7871-00000174"/> "'  THE  MSSING   BRIDE. the slightest obedience. In giving me-this dear hand in pri- vate marriage, while making me inexpressibly happy, you will transgress no law of God's nor of man's, nor do any wrong to any human being!" Specious arguments and well nigh unanswerable, but to which Marian would reply, "What you propose to me, dear Thurston, may not be absolutely wrong, yet in a secret marriage there is an appear' ance of evil which I am unwilling that you or I should assume. Dear Thurston, I do not like a mystery, I like our lives to be as open to the inspection of man as to God-as open as the blessed daylight P" "Or as your own fair, clear, radiant beauty, my Marian I But, oh! l;py darling girl, how willful, how arbitrary, how cruel and despotic you are with your likes and dislikes!" "Dearest Thurston, if you only knew how much pain it gives  me, how unnatural it feels to me to refuse you anything, you would not press me so. But, dearest Thurston, be patient' for a little while, and reflect that the time shall come when your will shall be the law of your Marian's life, when there'll be no wish your heart can form but shall -govern all her actions."  "Ah I   dear, cruel girl I how do I know .that? Who shall assure me of that?   I am going far away-you will be left here. Life is changeable, youth inconstant; and though I know the truth of my own heart, know that I am bound to you Forever and forever-how do I  know yours-who shall assure ne of its constancy,?"  "I will," said Marian, earnestly. " will. Were I bound o  you in marriage, as fast as priests and legislators could bind Is, I  could not be truer to you than I am now, and shall ever ii Fe. Take my hand in yours, and receive my oath of fealty-  hat henceforth, in my heart of hearts, I will consider you as  iy husband, and the arbiter of my earthly fate; that I will ever turn my thoughts for an instant to the contemplation of  ay other possible destiny than that of your wifeI Are you tisfied now, dearest Thurston?" she murmured softly, letting )r face fall gently on his shoulder. ^^ ^ E   TH-E   BRIDE   OF  AN HO O U R.  363 Satisfied I no, he was not I Never, in the whole course of his life, had he felt so unsatisfied. Never, even since he had known Marian, had his passions been so deeply moved as now they were by the beauty, grace, and charm--the ineffable fas- cination of her looks and words and manners. Swiftly passing his arm around her waist, he whispered, in tones scaely audible from excess of feeling, "Marian I Marian I Marian I Oh, give yourself to me I Give yourself to me when we get to Washington, or I shall never go from there. I can never leave you, Marian; never I - Nor can I wait for you. Be mine, Marian I let all else go I wealth, po- sition, prospects, all-all-but you I Come poverty, struggle, trial, any and every form of suffering, rather than a: parting from you I See I now I implore--not for a secret marriage, but for a public one I Oh, I should be proud to claim this pearl above price as my own in the sight of heaven and earth I Speak, Marian, speak I Will you give me your hand in the presence of our friends, as soon as we get to Washington?" "No", dearest Thurston-I must not. I dare not. I will not bring you to poverty. I refused a secret marriage, and still more absolutely do I reject the public one." "And w-thy? And why? Heaven and earth!    was ever a man so cruelly treated-so stretched upon the rack? Why? I ask you, Marian?"  "Because I will not consent thatyou shall sacrifice all your prospects for love of me "  "Is that it? Then I will do it whether you will or not-! As soon as I have taken you to Washington, I will turn about and go down to Dell-Delight, and say to the old man there-' Sir, make- your will and leave your large estate to whom you please, for I will marry no other woman except Miss Mayfield, and I  will marry her as soon as I can win her consent.' And then, when the old man has turned me adrift, and I have nothing to lose-then, Marian, you will accept me 1" said Thurston, pas- sionately, vehemently.        - . "No," she answered, gently. "No, dearest, still less would  &#xD;<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7871-00000175"/> 864     TEa   MSSING   BRIDE. I do so then.

"Thurston," she said, "I intend to be your true, faithfal, patent maiden, until I can be your happy wife.  ; A passionate reply arose to his lilps; but before he could give it utterance, his attention was suddenly arrested by the sight of Mrs. Waugh's carriage stopping and filling up the way. Before them was a narrow, guttered, dangerous road, winding between the trees, up a steep and difficult hill. And old Oliver had got down to lead the horses. Within the carriage, Mrs. Waugh's voice was heard laugh.- ing and speaking. She seemed to be the life of her own little party, and, alas I the only life there; but still she laughed and jested, partly from the abundance of her own good health, and the overflowing of her own good nature, and partly with the wish to arouse and amuse the pensive, peevish little bride and her morose bridegroom. And now she let down her window and put out her head, and good-humoredly hailed Thurston, and warned him to mind his horse's head, and not grow senti- mental, and upset the gig and break her Hebe's neck, while pouring soft nonsense into her ear. When they got-up the steep, winding hill, the carriages fell into their former order, and proceeded as before. Thurston renewed his former earnest importunities, but with no better success than formerly, until at length for the time being be de- sisted. And still, in. places where their road was steep, narrow, guttered, or otherwise difficult, and their carriages had to pro. ceed slowly, Mrs. Waugh would let down her window, put out her head, and open the little battery with her small shot of badinage, And so pleasantly they traveled on until three o'clock, when they reached Horsehead, where they stopped to dine, and where, upon account of Jacquelina's extreme fatigue, they concluded to spend the night.   THE   BRIDE   OP  AN  HOUR.    36* The next morning, after an early breakfast, they resumed their journey, traveling in the same manner and order, until about noon, when they reached Washington City. . At that time, the principal hotel in Washington was the Mansion House, near the end of the city. To this house our party of travelers immediately proceeded. And havingtheood fortune to find excellent apartments vacant, they secured them at once, and settled themselves down for the winter. Mrs. Waugh had several friends and acquaintances among the old substantial citizens of Washington-families whose fore- fathers had owned the soil, and lived upon it, long before the city itself was laid out; and she lost no time in advising them of her presence. And Doctor Grimshaw also, besides being an intimate friend of the representative from their -own Congres- sional district, and a political partizan of their state's senators, was also well acquainted with some of the leading men of the administration, and had brought letters of presentation to others, which he died not delay to forward. . Thurston Willcoxen- was intimate with the family of the resi. dent French Minister, having formed their acquaintance in Paris. And thus, with all these facilities of introduction, our rustic friends soon, found an easy and pleasant entrance into the best society of Washington.  But of all the party, the poor little, half-crazed, half-broken- hearted bride, Jacquelina, was the only one who threw herself with perfect abandon into the whirl of fashionable society. :She accepted every invitation, and made i point of being present at every possible place of amusement or festivity. Thus, no mat- ter what the state of the-weather might'be, night after night would she drag Doctor Grimshaw into scenes and companies opposed to his tastes and habits, and where, besides, he was not in the least fitted to shine.      "  , - But Jacquelina was. In thosewsenes of gayety she seemed quite a different being from the pale, feverish invalid that she was at home. There was a brilliant glow upon her cheeksa splendid light in her eyes, a flow of spirits, anda aflash of i't  &#xD;<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7871-00000176"/> 366     THE   MSSING   BRIDE. as startling, as wondrous, as fascinating as it was unreal, illu. sive, and bewildering. She was excessively admired and sought for, and seemed not in the least degree disposed to reserve herself. Thus evening after evening was passed in the whirl of fashion- ablsociety. Nor was Sunday an exception to the rule, for upon that evening, rather than stay at home, she would insist upon going to some church or some lecture-room to hear some discourse upon home or foreign missions, Sunday schools, tem- perance, colonization, or some other kindred subject in which she took not the slightest interest, and of which she heard not one single word, while she sat with her little, fair, transparent face as still, as lifeless as a picture, and her unresting spirit far away-far away I So night after night, and- nearly all night long, would she keep Doctor Grimshaw out. Not that she in the least desired his "comfortable presence." - But, inasmuch as he could not prevent her from going out, and could not banish the handsome and fascinating Thurston Willcoxen from the same party, he was resolved always to attend his "wife," as he delighted to call Sans Souci, in spite of her indignant and frenzied repudia- tion of the title. And to Doctor Grimshaw's inexpressible annoy- ance and vexation, strangers invariably and naturally mistook Jacquelina and Thurston for the bridal pair, and the professor for the papa of the bridegroom. And, really, there seemed a family likeness between Doctor Grimshaw -and Thurston Will- eoxen; for though the one was fair and the other dark; the one illumined by the-sunshine of enlightened thought, and the other darkened by the shadows of fanaticism; the one joyous X with love and hope, and the other morose with disappointment and jealousy ;--there was a certain general resemblance in form and features, in air and manner, in expression and tone of voice, and above all, a certain high, imposing distinction of presence peculiar to both, that might not strike you at first, but which might readily lead you, in a shaded room, or a twilight walk, or in any doubtful light, to mistake the one for the other.   T HE   BRIDE 0OP AN    HOUR.    867 But Thurston Willcoxen, in carrying out his threat to give the jealous bridegroom an abundance of cause for his jealousy, really and in sober fact only rendered the childish bride such general and unexceptionable attentions as any gentleman might blamelessly pay to any young married lady of his own rank and circle. Yet under the circumstances, this was quite food enough for Doctor Grimshaw's "green-eyed monster," who thrived and grew so rampant upon it, that Mrs. Waugh became anxious, and again spoke to Thurston upon the subject. "Don't you see that the miserable lunatic is half frantic with jealousy? And positively, I am afraid he will grow quite so, and do himself or some of us some mortal harm. Now do, Thurston, keep out of poor Lapwing's company; don't look at her; don't speak to her; forget that she is in the room; neglect her!" "But I cannot do that without absolute rudeness." "Well, then, be absolutely rude, rather than let your polite- ness cause so much misery. - Don't even see Lapwing I  Turn your eyes somewhere else! Now there's my Hebe! Seemsfto me unaccountable that you should live in the same house, sit at the same table, and be so utterly blind to the charms of my Hebe I Seems to me if Iwere a young gentleman, Ishould not be so indifferent, nor leave a perfect rose of beauty to droop in a close drawing-room, when I might be taking her out into:the sunshine, and showing her all over the city. Seems to me so  But then young men are not now  s they used to be hern- I was young I Then there was some gallantry, some chivalry, some loyal devotion to the royal claims of beauty; now, any ugly heiress, with a cheek as yellow as her own gold, can buy away the subjects of the very queen of beauty I Yet it is not so in my Hebe's  case, either, sir I She could be followed, served, and worshiped, I am sure, sir, if she were not so choice in her satellitesl I fancy you would think so, if you only opened your eyes to see how the gentlemen adore her from ,a distance t But you-a young gentleman of our own party- your indifference to my Hebe, is perfectly unaccountable andd highly exasperating to my feelings!" ;  &#xD;<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7871-00000177"/> THE  MSSING   BRID". Thurston laughed, complimented the good lady upon her perspicacity, and promised to mend his manners in those ob- jectionable points of which she had complained. And he kept his word. Hitherto he had, with pain and reluctance, yet as a matter of discretion, and at Marian's own earnest desire, avoided paying her any attentions whatever. His few interviews with the beau- tiful girl had been stolen, short and sweet; had been snatched by himself in the intervals of other company, when Marian really "chanced" to be alone. Now, however, having Mrs. Waugh's amusing complaints upon the score of his neglect, to report to the maiden, he might be able to persuade her to give him a little more of her society, in rides, walks, and, sight-see- ings about the capital. Up to this time Marian had gone very little into society; the reason was plainly this-Marian had no wardrobe proper for festive scenes. Her usual morning dress was a fine French gray merino, and Mrs. Waugh had presented her with a pale 'blue satin, for evening costume; but that one dress could not be worn everywhere; nor could Marian be persuaded to accept another such a present. Therefore, while Jacquelina, Doctor Grimshaw, and Thurston Willcoxen, went every morning to the Senate or the House of Representatives, or to some other place of public gathering, and every evening to some ball, party, concert, or play, Marian, the "flower of the flock," re- mained at home to keep Mrs. Waugh company; happy in doing so too, was the maiden, for there was a bond of real re- spect and affection between the blooming girl and the elderly woman. This voluntary seclusion did not prevent Marian being included in all the invitations extended to her party. And notwithstanding her plain dress, simple manners, and retired habits, Marian was greatly admired. And her declining to mix freely with gay and fashionable society was ascribed by some to austere piety, by others to excessive pride, by none to poverty I For in Marian's aspect, there was a certain unob- trusive dignity and self-esteem-a certain unconscious queenli-   369   THE BRIDE OF AN HOUR.   ness of presence-as one whose superiority had been too long a matter of nature and of habit, to be that of thought or as- rertion; and in truth, in all personal attributes Marian was superior to almost every one she met; and in her intercourse with others there was a certain involuntary condescension, even as from a princess taught from her birth graciousness as a grace -a certain quiet air of reserved power that impressed all who came within its influence, and which worldly and superficial thinkers believed only great wealth and social importance could confer. And meanwhile, never dreaming of the fortune and rank that had been ascribed to her, Marian passed her monm- ings and her evenings quietly in Mrs. Waugh's apartments. But between Mrs. Waugh's good-humored raillery and ex- postulations, and Thurston's entreaties and persuasions, Marian was at length induced to emerge from her retirement and go out with her lover. And now she was happy to be free to give him her company, so happy that her countenance beamed with calm delight, and her beauty grew brighter every day-so much brighter,&gt; that it became a subject of remark to Mrs. Waugh, who vowed that Marian had been fairy-favored in some way. And one morning after breakfast, when Mrs. Waugh had  waddled wearily up the stairs to the room occupied by herself and Marian, and dropped down heavily into her chair-andre- covered breath, she said, "Well, Hebe half the gentlemen in our dining-room are in love with you I"  "Nonsense, Mrs. Waugh I" said' Marian, blushing ingenue- ously. "No 'nonsense' in the case I! I tell you their coffee grows cold while they, look up at you I or at least while they sit aid gaze, or cast sidelong furtive glances up at our corner of the table. So it must be that they are smitten with you or me. And I hope, for the sake of good taste and sound morality, it is not with me, a woman of fifty-five, who weighs one hun' dred and eighty pounds, and has a husband besides; but since you disclaim so scornfully, perhaps it is me now, and they ta: &#xD;<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7871-00000178"/> me for a widow, and value good looks by size, age and weight I shall put you on the other side of the table to test the matter. And then if I find it is I, I shall write to the Commodore, that's all'. Marian laughed, and was glad to escape Mrs. Waugh's rail- ery by putting on her bonnet and shawl and going down to seek Thurston, with whom she had an appointment to go to the Senate that morning. She found him waiting for her in the drawing-room. There were other ladies and gentlemen present, so merely greeting her with a slight bow, he said that the car riage was already in waiting below, and conducted her down. When they had entered the carriage, Thurston took her hand, and pressing it within his own, held it a long time in silence, gazing mournfully in her eyes the while. "What is it now, dear Thurston ?" she said, gently. But he sighed deeply, pressed her hand, and let it go, saying, "I cannot tell you now." And indeed the rattling of carriages, and the mingled deaf- ening noises of the Avenue effectually prevented a sustained conversation; but when after a ride of fifteen minutes they " reached the Capitol, in handing her out, Thurston whispered, " Dearest Marian, will you come into the library with me for a few minutes ?' It is quite deserted at this time, all the world having left it to flock to the Senate Chamber, to secure good places to hear the squeaking voice of John Randolph." "But had we not better 'go and do likewise,' if we wish to get a seat and hear the speech ?" "My dearest one, his speeches are pleasanter to read than to , listen to. And I must have a private interview with you this morning."  Marian then assented, and he led her up the broad steps, terrace after terrace, and into the portico, and through the great hall, and up another broad flight of stairs, and into the splendid saloon-the library of Congress. It was, indeed, quite deserted, a thing never- occurring, except, as now, when some great star of the forum was expected to rise in the Senate   E BR I D S     "-- or the Hou se.

He led her up the whole length of the saloon to an obscure and shadowy alcove where there were two chairs and a small stand. t,  arian ," sat i Thurston, leaning across the little table that divided them , and looking earnestly in her eyes- "Marian, do you recollect-what day this is?" "No, dear Thurston, not exactly." "It is the thirtieth of January, Marian, and on the first of February I sail for Liverpool." "Oh, no! N  o, no l" she exclaimed, starting as if suddenly hrt- "so soon? I had thought, I had fancied, I had hoped that you would not go so soon t" "Then I really will not, dearest M ariai eaest  istress of my fate, I will not leave you till you send me away." "No, no I would not detain you from duty, Heaven knows. How selfish and inconsiderate I am Do not mind my tears, dear Thurston! It is onlybecause I am unprepared. You have not lately talked of going." "I did not like to talk of it. I did not wishtofling ashadow on my Marian's bright brow one hoiur before it was necessary. But did not my dear one know that I had purposed to sail on the first of the month?"b "A  hl yes, I knew; but I was beuled by the sweet passage of the time, and by your silence othe subject, into the ho that you were not going quiteo so on." "And was the time sweet to you, dear girl?" ,' Very, very sweet to me, 'tmarmured Marian, in low, musical tones--"I have always been happy, dearest Thurston--but never, never so happy as in these few weeks that we have been so much together." "My own heart's darlingl is it so?" he said, earnestly, mov- ing his chair around to her 'side of the stand, and taking her hand, and looking beseechingly in: her eyes as he prayed-"Y' ha; Su X  &#xD;<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC7871-00000179"/> own, dearest MIarian, my heart's dearest queen, I have one part- ing petition to make I Will you grant it ?  Oh I beloved! will you grant it ?1" " What is it, dear Thurston ?" she inquired, in a low, tremu- lous, misgiving voice. ' Will you give me this fair hand in marriage before I go ? You .turn away your head-your eyes are full of tears. Ah, Marian, what does this augur ?" "Dear Thurston, I thought this subject was closed between us until it could be opened under happier auspices." "But I reopen it under a new aspect. My best and dearest one, hear me; this evening at five o'clock I leave here in the night coach for Baltimore. Observe that I stay with you till the latest moment, Marian. At four o'clock give me your hand in marriage, and I leave you from the altar. What difference can it make to you, Marian ? It is but sealing, legalizing the betrothal already passed between us. Just on the eve of along voyage as I am, just asking for the ceremony as I do, what difference, now, if you are in earnest, can it make to you ?" Marian did not reply-her hand was trembling in his clasp, and her eyes had drooped beneath his gaze. " If you love me as I know you do, my own! if you are sincere in your wish to be mine I if you are sincere in your intention to keep your maiden vow of betrothal, as I am sure you are, my beloved! why object to this marriage ceremony now passing between us, since it will be but a more solemn and binding mode of betrothal, and-we can wait as before ?" he said, and when his tongue ceased to plead, his eyes took up the burden of the prayer. Never in her life had Marian been so profoundly agitated with conflicting emotions. The color kindled and died on her cheek--her bosom rose and fell as-with an inward storm.  IHe saw his advantage, and pursued it.

Those who go to sea may never return again -those who part may never meet. And were my dearest Marian destined never to see my living face again, how bitter would be the thought that she had refused my last prayer." "Oh!

His arm still clasped her waist, her face was still -hidden on his shoulder, her form was quivering with emotion.- She did not or could not reply. Then- "Remember, Marian, it is likely to be as I say-that when I return I shall be able to take you proudly to my heart, for he is ninety-five." !"Oh, do not speculate upon such a fact, dearest Thurston H 'it is worse than all the rest, for it is really sinful, and will draw down upon us the righteous judgment of Heaven!

And so, in the overflowing-of his gratitude and joy, he cou- tinued to talk to her and caress her, while the time slipped unheeded by, until the adjournment of the Senate sent people straying itto the library. Then he arose.  &#xD;<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC7871-00000181"/> o      T THE M I S S I N  BRIDE. "My dearest love, I have been bewitched. How late it is! and we have so much to accomplish before evening. @ Come; I must take a carriage and go to the county clerk's office before it is closed. You must go with me, dear Marian; I cannot lose sight of you to-day--our last day." And carefully arranging. her shawl upon her graceful shoulders, he drew her arm within his own, and conducted her from the library and down stairs into the open court-yard. Thurston gave orders to be driven immediately to the court house, which they reached in about ten minutes. Leaving Marian in the carriage, he hastened into the building; found the county clerk just in the hurry of closing up his office, pro- cured the marriage license, and hastened back to Marian.  He directed the coachman to drive to the Navy-Yard Hill, and there, in the remotest and quietest suburb of the city, he hunted up a pastor of a small Methodist society, in whose little chapel, without-witnesses, Thurston and Marian were married. From the humble chapel he led her to the hack, and gave orders to be driven back to the Mansion House, where they arrived just before the ringing of the second dinner-bell. Marion went to her room to lay off her bonnet and shawl and arrange her hair for dinner. Mrs. Waugh liad already left the apartment, and Marian was glad for once to find it empty, that she might kneel down beside her bed and pour forth the fullness of her heart in thanksgiving and prayer-thanking God for the deep joy that was filling and overflowing her soul, and praying His blessing on her husband-her husband, she lingered in fond devotion upon the adored name-her husband and his voyage. Then she arose, and in the blessed dream of love she went mechanically through her simple toilet, and passed down stairg to the dining-room, where the guests were already assembled at the table.  Thurston was awaiting her near the entrance. Natural as thati act was she had not anticipated it, and her heart bounded- when she saw him. He  led her to her seat by Mrs. Waugh, - and then went to his own. / , .   THE  BRIDE   OF   AN  HOUR.    8" "You see now the soup is cold, Hebe," said Mrs. Waugh. "Where in the world have you been? It is astonishing to me the indifference of young people to-good living. Now the best speech I have heard this season was not half so good as this turtle soup, when it was hot, but maybe they have got some hot in the kitchen. I don't believe you're listening to a word I say to you, Hebe." "Ma'am!" said Marian, startled out of her dream. "  10h you hear now. Well, Hebe," continued the good lady, in a low tone, audible only to her companion. "I believe after all it is I whom the men admire, for they have been- look- ing up at this corner just as much as ever, with this inconsid- erable difference, that their eyes have wandered continually from your empty chair to the door; but that was nothing, you know. So hide your blooming face, Hebe, for my greater proportions overshadow it," concluded Mrs. Waugh, as she turned her attention to the plate of boiled rockfish and egg sauce that the waiter just laid before her.  :  It was nearly six o'clock when the guests left the dining- room. Mrs. Waugh went up to her room to take her afternoon nap, having previously received the adieus of Thurston. Jac- quelina went up to hers to lie down and rest before dressing to go to the theatre. Doctor Grimshaw strayed into the reading- room to sulk over the newspapers. Thurston and Marian found an -opportunity to be alone in the drawing-room for the few moments preceding his departure. In those last moments she could not find it in her heart to withhold one word whose utterance would cheer his soul, and give him hope and joy and confidence in departing. Marian had naturally a fine, healthful, high-toned organization-a happy, hopeful; joyous temperament, an inclination always to look upon the sunny side of life and events. And so when he drew her gently and tenderly to his bosom, ;an :. whispering, "You have made me the happiest and most grateful man on earth, dear, lovely Marian I dear, lovely wifeI but are you 31*'  &#xD;<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7871-00000182"/> 378     THE  MSS ING   BRIDE. satisfied, beloved-ohI are you satisfied? do I leave you at ease?'  She spoke the very truth, when she confessed to him--her head being on his shoulder, and her low tones flowing softly to his listening ear- "More than satisfied, Thurston-more than satisfied. I am inexpressibly happy now. Yes, though you are going away; for, see I the pain of parting for a few months, is lost in the joy of knowing that we are united, though separated-and in antici- pating the time not long hence, when we shall meet again. God- bless you, dearest Thurston."             3, "God forever bless and love you, sweet wife." And so they parted. Marian had said that she was " inexpressibly happy." And so she was, as long as hig arms were around her, and words of mutual endearment, hope and promise were breathed between them. But when he was really gone-when the last glimpse of the stage-coach was cut off, Marian turned away, and she wan- X dered lonely and restless through the halls and drawing-rooms of the great -hotel--how empty, though full of tenants-how desolate, though full of social life, they seemed. At last she went to her own room, and gave way to a burst of tears; not very bitter-it was only the breaking up of the passing cloud of sorrow that: naturally overshadowed the hour after parting. And when this shower was: oer, the sun shone out again in her bright nature-and all was-love, and hope, and joy in her buoyant heart. So that when the sound of the supper-bell aroused Mrs. Waugh from her deep sleep--not a trace of sorrow- shaded Marian s sunny brow. "Yaw-w i" gaped the good woman, only half awake--" is fthat- the first' bell? I'm getting tired of this worthless life; iothng but dressing and eating, and undressing and sleeping, and waking up and dressing and eating- again.. 'taw-w-w.

She fnished with an awful yawn. - , Yaw-w-w-oh-h-h I And I don't believe it is doing Lap- wing the least good, poor, willful, unhappy child 1 I've a great mind to propose going home. What do you- think about it, Hlebe? -I don't believe she hears a word I say-Hebe 1". Ma'am 1" exclaimed Marian, starting out of her reverie, and blushing deeply. "What do you say to our going home next week?" "I shall be very glad to go, Mrs. Waugh." "Well, child, I'll name it to the Professor, and I think we'll go," said Henrietta, rising and preparing to make her plain evening toilet. In a happy dream, Marian helped her to finish dressing, went down with her to the supper-table, and thence accompae nied her to the drawing-room. But there, as Marian was very much admired, and her company and conversation very 'much sought, her blissful' reverie was so dispersed that she longed for % the hour of withdrawing, that she might escape to her room, and there, with the visible world shut out, live her inner life. Ten o'clock, Mrs. Waugh's bed time, came at last--and the lady, with Marian, retired to their'apartment. Good Henrietta wassoon asleep. And Mariai sought her pilow, to, elose her eyes and thinkof her happiness, and dream her beautiful dreamis in peace. Andthere she: lay, with her blooming cheek and bright auburn hair lightly pressed uponthe downy pillow-the heavenly smile of loving and devoted thoughts curving her ruby lips, and kindling under her dark eye-lashes, "Heis m husbanda," she murmured, softly," smiling to-"herself'"de name, sweet thought-it is-no dream from which H s'lall it is the blessed, blessed reality.

The next morning Mrs. Waugh broached the subject of re- turning home to Doctor Grimshaw. The Professor was willing, nay anxious to accede to the proposition. But when the plan was named to Jacquelina, she put her instant veto upon it. ' Those might go who liked St. Mary's I She didn't-and she should stay where she was!" It was of no use -to contend with the willful one-still she answered, "Those might go who wished' --she put no con- straint upon any one's actions, nor would she suffer any con- straint upon hers! She should remain. They had no hold upon her conscience or her affections, and so-they had no means of constraining her; therefore the journey home had for the time to be deferred. And thenceforth the very demon of perversity seemed to enter the child. She gadded about continually, flirted desperately, lavished money wantonly. She kept Doctor Grimsbaw on the qui vive every instant of his life, tormenting him day and night with the most extravagant eccentricities, going into hysterics on- the slightest possible pro- vocation, and at the shortest notice, and afterwards screaming with laughter at "Grim's" dismay and terror. Grinding his r teeth in bitter rage, he would declare that it was all because that "puppy Willeoxen" was gone, and he grew more acrimo- niously jealous than before. So great was the excitability and disorder of- her nervous system, that serious fears were enter- w'!tmined by her friends for the stability of her reason. But when -any such fears chanced to be betrayed: to her knowledge; she would laugh her wild, shrill, elfish laugh, and declare that her ,senses were safe-that shedid not mean to go mad until she had first driven "Grim" so-then maybe I   THE  BRIDE    OF AN   HOUR'.   . 381 Marian was the only being from whom she would bear one word of expostulation, and Marian, in her grave, sweet way, reasoned with her. "The life you lead, dear Lina, makes all your friends very. miserable." "Ha, hal Well, they made me miserable firstl I miserable forever I I have suffered the greatest wrong a girl could. ever receive!" "Your present course does not make you happier, nor right that wrong, poor child." "I know it doesn't, but it worries Grim', though!" "And why should you pursue it for that reason?" "Why? you ask me why? I hate him I Oh, how I hate him!" "Listen to me, dear Lina, for I love you, and I will not wrong you by any vain words or false consolations. You are not happy, I know-under these circumstances you can never be so in this world. I will not mock you by pretending that you can 1 No, you cannot be. happy, but you can be more than that, higher than that, you can be GOOD. Christ, our Ex- emplar, was not 'happy ;' He was a ' man of sorrows,' but He was the perfecty good. Take up the :cross of:life, and follow: Him. Ask Him, and He will, give you strength to lift the bur den, and make it easy to your shoulders. You will never fine peace nor rest till you do. If you have lost earthly happiness. do not therefore forsake duty, and cast away eternal joys. Out mortal life, at longest and at best, is but a transient struggle compared to eternity, and no scheme of life and happiness in this world is so valuable and so sublime, as that of the de, velopment and perfection of our own spirits. As for Doctor Grimshaw, he has done wrong, but that is past and cannot be undone. He is unhappy, and much to be pitied; judge him leniently as you can-try to speak kindly to him." If Marian's words produced little present effect, they nevoer theless sunk into the unhappy girl's heart, as the words of no other ever did.            -.     . And it was Marian who finally prevailed upon the pervers creature to consent to return home. 24  &#xD;<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7871-00000184"/> 382     THE    MSSING   BRIDE.

CHAPTER    X Xx. X. GOLDEN    OPINI ONS. "They' have honored me of late; and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people,' Which should be worn now in their newest gloss, o Not cast aside so soon."-Shakspeare. MARIAN'S return home was an ovation. Had she ever doubted her sovereignty over hearts, she must have been reassured by her reception. Not only did Edith weep for joy at her com- ing, and little Miriam follow and wait upon her with idolatrous devotion, which was natural and to be expected; but when it was generally known that she had returned to the neighbor- hood, many friends and acquaintances, who had never been at the cottage before, now called to see her; and tea-drinkings and other little parties were given in her honor. And on Sunday at church, after the morning service, not only her female companions, but also the grave deacons and elders of the church, thronged around her to welcome her home. Colonel Thornton and his'.maiden sister were especially kind and polite. Colonel- Thornton informed her that, if she should be disengaged-the next morning, his sister and himself would call at Old Fields, to propose a plan for her consideration that required more time for thought- and discussion than could be given to it just then at church. Marian readily promised to remain at home the next day to receive her visitors. And with   GOLD'ENX OPINIONS      .     88 mutual expressions of friendship and good wishes they sepa rated.

In ths and in two-subsequent meetings, the whole preliminaries hi been arranged, the money subscribed, the site of the scho r -   chosen, the trustees elected, the teacher appointed, and h very liberal salary fixed. And now--Colonel Thornton and I sister had come as a committee to inform Marian of her a pointment, and to solicit her acceptance of the post. It was with smiles of heartfelt joy, that Marian clasped t hands of her friends, and assured them of the pleasure she f in receiving the situation they had done her the honor to offe p,'    The Colonel and Miss Thornton seemed very much pleas i:   by her prompt, frank and joyous acceptance of the post, a arose to depart. And again the friends bade adieu to es other with mutual and cordial expressions of affection and spect. A Marian was pleased, deeply pleased with the proof of coT At   dence she had received, and the prospect of occupation and independence that it offered. Her school duties were expec to commence upon the first Monday-in March. Ten or twelve days only intervened before that day, and the course of their passage, Marian received two letters fr Thurston--the first written upon the eve of his sailing fr Baltimore, and the second written from the sea; and sent b homeward bound vessel.  These letters were long and i quent, filled with " thoughts that breathe, and words that bur overflowing with devoted- affection and ardent aspiratic  And ohl how they were read, and re-read, and -treasured Marian!

Truan--to which address she was also requested to direct her answers. With the treasured letters in her bosom, lying upon her loving heart, she went about in the golden mist of her own happy and devoted thoughts. The first Monday in March came, and Marian repaired to the village to meet the trustees of her school, and to be inaugu- rated into her new ofice. Her school-room was new, well built, well aired,. well furnished, and in every respect very pleasant. Her pupils comprised twelve or fourteen young ladies, who had already in the Sunday-school received the benefit of Marian's instructions, and who were now prepared with loving reverence to accept her as their teacher. To her everything was made agreeable and attractive. The high respect and confidence in which she was held by the trustees, the veneration and affection with which she was honored by her pupils, even the pleasant locality, arrangement, and appointments of her school-room- all were subjects of congratulation to herself, and of thankful. ness to Heaven. And not the least among the generous girl's reasons for plea- sure and gratitude, was the thought that her position would enable her to systematize the education of little Miriam, whom she at once resolved to take daily with her to the school; while her salary would afford her the means of adding many comforts to the home and daily life of Edith. Marian's school was soon brought into beautiful order, and her days now passed in serene happiness. Every month in. creased her usefulness and social importance, and gained her new friends and new honors. The school under her charge prospered so greatly, and increased so rapidly, that it soon be- come necessary to advertise for assistants. And when they were found and engaged; Marian was at once relieved from the drudgery of details, and advanced to the post of principal. In -the meantime she continued to receive letters from "'Thomas Truman," who had reached Edinburgh, "and had seen his younger brother, and was then making arrangements for a speedy return to the United States, which he hoped and ex-   GOLDEN- OPINIONS.          8i pected to reach; about the first of June. Marian had writtea a full' account of the new academy for young ladies, 'and her own appointment as its principal. It was of course very long, even near the last of May,, before she received an answer, in- which he expressed his regret that his Marian should be called upon to labor-his grief that it was not in his power at 'once to re-. iieve her, and withal his unqualified approbation of any step shle might have thought proper to take, as everything:she did was necessarily certain to beright. The same letter conveyed to her the joyful news that he was just on the eve of- embarka- tion for the United States, where he 'expected to- arrive in a very few days after her receipt of his letter. It' was Friday evening, on her way from school, that she received this letter, and from the moment of finishing its perusal, Marian lived and moved in a happy dream. It was well for her pupils that her-&gt; school duties were over for the week-it was well for herself- ,that her ride back to Old Fields was a long, solitary oie. .Her trance was unbroken until she reached home, where 'she found Mrs. Waugh waiting for her.                                 3 "I 'have come over, Hebe, to invite you and Edith t a  house-warming at Luckenough on the first of June-next Mon- day, you know I And, mind, I will take no refusal," said the good lady cheerfully, as Marian greeted her.    -   ' . Luckenough was now completed, the mansion-house having  been rebuilt and newly furnished in the most elegant manner.  The family had been settled in their ancient home now about a week, and were, according to custom, about to givea large  party. " Tell me about Jacquelina," said Marian, anxiously, as she laid off her bonnet and sat down. '  '             - "What about Lapwing, my dear ?

Lor, Hebe I! if I had chosen to fret myself' because of evil doers,' I might have been as thin as a broomstick by this *time 1" "Yet, after all, Mrs. Waugh, I suppose it does not lie so  much in the choice of your will as in the 'happy temperament' you spoke of?" "Yes. Well, Hebe, I must go.  You will be sure to come on Monday evening, for Lapwings sake?"   GOLDEN     OPINIONS.        387 "I will be sure to come, Mrs. Waugh." "And try to bring Edith along.

"No, Aunt Henrietta," said Edith; "I am not soj, but I could not bring myself to enter Luckenough, unless my uncle were first to come here and be reconciled to me."

It had long been the desire of Marian to make peace with Edith and her uncle, and the most favorable opportunity had occurred. And as soon as Mrs. Waugh. ad gone, she opened the subject. She begged her to reflect that notwithstanding all that had occurred, he was still her uncle; that he had been her first anc greatest benefactor; that he had'filled a father's post towards her; that when he had cast her off, it was because she had, b] her marriage, disappointed him in his most cherished wish that now he was an aged man, whose remaining days were few uncertain, and full of troubles; that though he had been, ane still continued to be violent, unreisonable and' ppressive, ye it better became his young relatives- who called themselve Christians, to seek, by kindness, by tolerance, by 'readiness it forgive and forget, and by exhibiting the loveliness -of an oppa site character, to ameliorate the faults of his own; that thet were no half-measures in Christianity, which includes a perfe( faith, hope and charity, a perfect willingness to forgive, to be lieve in, to hope for, to work for, to love, to redeem, and t save our enemies-or is not Christianity.

She succeeded in persuading hJier to forget her past injuries, and to meet more 'than half-way her uncle's advances towards a reconciliation, by accepting his invitation to the house-warming. It was decided that little Miriam also should accompany them. And this matter being arranged, Marian, with her usual cheerful promptitude, went briskly to work with the prepara- tions. All that evening, and all the next day, she busied her- self with altering and modernizing Edith's black Italian crape rote, and in getting up hr own and Miriam's dresses. Yet, busily as Marian worked, swiftly as her fingers flew, quickly and neatly as her various tasks were finished, all was done me- chanically; her thoughts were not in her labors-they were far away at sea, seeking out, hovering around the " homeward bound." By Saturday night, ,all the preparations were completed, and the care for them troubled Marian no more, either at 'church on Sunday, or at her school-room on Monday. And in part, as far as her own costume was concerned, she needed not have troubled herself at any time, for on her return from school on Monday afternoon, she found, waiting for her at home, a large: bandbox, directed "To MY HEBE," which, when opened, was found to contain alight and elegant evening dress, of t lilac-colored crape, finished with blonde lace. There were also white kid gloves, white satin slippers, an embroidered hand- kerchief and a beautiful wreath of white jessamine flowers. Marian surmised that Mrs. Waugh had certainly stolen hert dress patterns and her shoe and glove measures, to have pro- cured such perfect fits as the articles composing this costume proved to be. There was no possibility of refusing this dress now that .it was purchased, made up and sent home, and so, probably, Mrs. Waugh had reasoned. At all events, Marian /   889 G   L D  OPINIONS    .

Mrs. Waugh's carriage was waiting below to take them to Luckenough, and she hurried down to join Edith and Miriam, who were both quite ready.      -  Edith also looked very pretty, with her fair pey  face relieved by the slight, sillky, black ringlets, and tie floating, shadowy, black crape dress. Little Miriam ev ore a black gauze, embroidered with a deep border of crimson lamma work around the fll, double sodirts, and a narrower one around the short sleeves and the low bod- dice.  A slight wreath of crimson cypress -owets was twine around her jet black hair, her shining black ringlets hang dow to her waist, and her splendid Syrian eyes shone like two stars. Marian smiled with pleasure at the sight of her resplendent beauty, stooped and caressed her, and told her that she lboked like some bright tropical bird alighted down there in a Mary- land cottage.                 t Throwing light veils over their heads, and ligdhesharea around their shoulders, they entered the carriageand departed leaving the cottage in the sole charge of old Jenny, who,-bi the way, too thoroughly mistrusted and disapproved the who0i proceeding, to utter one wordof commen ttupon their goin until the carriage had rolled out 'ofsight, thenshe 'lifte ' both arms,'and gave vent to her feelings by exclaiming? ,'Weii, Lordl IInebber thought how a teralas had ome an' goed, she'd gone to Old iick aginl Btititaai all wanity and wexation o de sp' sind e 'deed she 1"  82*  &#xD;<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC7871-00000188"/> as lu n 16 a 1soN G B R IR: D E.  In the meantime they were driven rapidly towards Luck. enough, which they reached at the usual hour of country even- ing receptions-early candle:light. The new mansion-house had been built in exactly the style of the old one-of red stone, with three front gables. And the scene presented the usual appearance of country premises upon the occasion of a large evening party; tthat is to say, the lawn was covered, and the avenues choked, up with carriages and conveyances of all sorts, from the capacious family car- ria.ge of Colonel Thornton and others, down to the saddle- mules of Miss Nancy Skamp and her learned nephew.  The mansion was blazing with light, and thundering with music, and all the entries and passages were crowded with coachmen, waiting-maids, grooms and footmen who belonged to the house, or had come in attendance upon some of the company. They alighted from the carriage, and made their way through this unpleasant crowd to a room on the ground floor, corres- ponding to that which had once been Edith's, and where a serving-woman stood to admit and wait upon them. There were already a crowd of ladies in the room, all en- gaged in re-arranging their toilets. Edith soon settled her simple widow's dress, and Miriam's little fiery costume. And Marian had only to shake out the light falls of her skirts, settle the fragrant jessamine wreath upon her hair, draw on her gloves, and they were ready. And just as Marian was about to send a servant into the saloon to ask Mrs. Waugh to send some gentlemen to take them'in, Doctor Brightwell and Solomon Weismann appeared at the door to offer their services. And Edith accepted the arm of the former, and Mlarian that of the latter, while'she led little Miriam by the hand. And so they entered the saloon. It presented just the appearance that all other country saloons do in the like circumstances-it was redundantly ornamented with flowers and green vines, brilliantly illuminated with hang- ing chandeliers, and furnished with seats running around the room for the accommodation of the old people, the tired   I'   dancers, and the neglectedwall-flowers. The floors were un- carpeted, but highly polished with wax, and chalked for the I  quadrilles.  Mrs. Waugh, in a new, brown satin dress, and a white gauze turban, stood near the door to receive her guests. She has- tened forward to welcome her friends, and conduct them to a pleasant seat up at the farther end of the room, and after . walking a little while with Edith, and telling her how glad she felt to see her, she excused herself, and left them to go and meet some other guests who were just entering. Marian took a survey of the room. There were about four cotillions on the floor. And at the head of one she saw stand- ing Jacquelina and young Barnwell-her own rejected suitor. Jacquelina was even more fair and fragile than ever-she looked like some beautiful transparency. She wore a dress of gossa- mer blond over pale, green silk, and around her golden hair. was bound a string of small pearls, clasped above the brow, with a single emerald. Few complexions co ld have borne such a dress, but there was a vivid glow upon her cheeks and lips, and a streaming light from her two briliant eyes, that were, if possible, heightened by the cool, pale shades of her costume. Marian sighed deeply and sent up a prayer for her peace,- But little time had Marian to look about her, before Mrs. Waugh returned; bringing with her a young gentleman whom she presented to the young girl, and who immediately solicited the honor of her hand in the cotillion that was then forming. Marian assented and gave her haitd with a smile that turned the young man's head at once. But little did Marian think or care, either then, or afterwards; for whether she sat, or stood, or danced, or talked, or listened, it was done mechanically; her thoughts and cares were absent from  the passing scene, seeking and hovering around ,th "homeward-bound."  At' last it almost seemed as if she had won him spiritually to her side, for he seemed to be with her  amid the lighted saloon, amid the sounding music and the, thronging revelers, and with the thought 'f him now came  &#xD;<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC7871-00000189"/> 392   .

Oh I that such a meeting should happen in such a place and under such circumstances! He came up, and bowed, and shook hands with several of the persons near Marian, and who were old acquaintances of his own. And when he greeted Marian, there was nothing but the crushing pressure of his hand, and the brief intense gaze of his eyes-that betrayed how much of feeling he wisely had sup- pressed. As he stood there, he was immediately surrounded by friends and aaicantances, who came to welcome him back, and to chatter itohim, asking him a score of questions about the length of his- voi ge, the weather he had at sea, the time of his arrival, etc., etc.:-ietc. Thurston answered them with as much good humor as he could assume, while heartily wishing them all at the antipodes. Marian was also surrounded. Colonel Thornton, Mr. Barn well and Doctor Weismann had in turn found out her seat, and approached her, and now they lingered near her, each with the secret determination of out-lingering the others. "Impertinent puppies I I wonder how Miss Mayfield cai tolerate them for a moment," quoth Colonel Thornton in his heart, while he cast a sidelong, scornful glance at the two young gentlemen.   aOLDEN     OPINION  S.     893 ," Miserable old beau II wonder he is so ridicn ulous as to presume to address a young lady," sneered Messrs.

With a glad smile of surprise Thurston bowed, drew her hand, within his arm, and they began to thread their way through the crowd. "Thank you, dearest, dearest Marian-sweet wife  thank you i' he whispered in a thrilling voice, as they went,  But the people pressed so closely, that it was learly impos- sible to speak a confidential word that would nott be heard by others.

"Now, Mrs.. Shields, pray excuse me, and take care of our dear Doctor, while I. go to hunt up Mrs. Grimshaw, who has been dancing so continuously that I have had no opportunity of speaking to her. And now she is sitting down somewhere and I must find her." "You will not find her, my dear; she has left the room-she has probably gone in to supper, where all the company are going now. Come, Doctor I Mr. Willcoxen, give your arm to Miss Mayfield, and precede us to the supper room." There was no remedy; the company were all going one way; Thurston knew very well that if he and Marian remained be- hind, they would excite remark, so with a suppressed groan, he drew her hand through his arm and led the way. At the supper-table it was as bad as ever for the lovers. If the viands stopped the people's mouths, that circumstance only left their ears the more at liberty to hear all that passed. And Thurston could speak no 0loving word to Marian. He had no means of relieving his heart, but by occasional sly pressures of her hand -and, forgetting that he must not express the strength of his love by the strength of his hand, he so clasped and crushed to- gether her fair, roseate fingers, that Marian had other cause than pleasure to remember it. After supper it was worse than ever. The little, incorri- gible imp, Jacquelina, whom they had set out to seek, was found then too soon; for as soon as she saw Thurston and Marian together, she shook off Doctor Grimshaw's arm, re- quested him to keep his hateful figure out of her sight, and, leaving him to digest his mortification and jealousy as he could, hurried forward to join them, and to welcome Thurston with an assumed eagerness and delight, that none but a mad man, or what is the same thing, a jealous man, could ever mistake for the "love that doth make cowards ofFus all." And to Doctor Grimshaw's rage and despair, and to Thurston's ill concealed vexation, the unhappy elf passed her little thin hand through his idle arm, -and remained with the lovers the whole of the evening. In a neighborhood where the most stringent and ar-   GOLD   N OPINIO N S.       395 bitrary social laws govern the conduct of women, Sans Souci was laying herself open to the severest censure, and she knew it, and was glad to know it-and she seemed to delight in taking more pains to make people think and speak evil of her, than any sinner had ever taken to conceal his sins, and make the world think well of him. But she did not succeed any bet- ter than the opposite sort of hypocrites do. No- one thought or spoke ill of her. The translucent purity of the poor fairyls nature was too clear to all except to the passion-blinded Grim- shaw--and she,-could do or say any extravagant thing that she pleased, and have no severer comment made upon her, than- "How peculiar," "How eccentric," or "That is just exactly like Jacquelina! No one else could do so with impunity." Doctor Grimshaw's blood boiled with rage. It was with difficulty he restrained himself from going and taking Jacque- lina by the arm, and leading her from the room. But he knew W very well that if he should do such a thing as that, Jacquelina would fall into one of her violent and reallydangerous hysteric fits, and create a scene in which his dignity would be sure to suffer. How long his jealousy and his self-respect might'have struggled for the mastery, and which might have -finally cOn- quered, is uncertain ; for the company soon began to break up and disperse, and Thurston Willcoxen, vexed, worn -out, and bored half to death bythe pretended favor of the willful elf, arose and excused himself, and Deft her and Marian sitting together.           .  Edith now came up, and told Marian that her Aunti Waugh had insisted that they should stay all night; that little"Miriam was already in bed; and that Mrs. Waugh   had promised that the carriage should take them back early in the morn- ing. Jacquelina, now that there was no more mischief to be done, let her head gradually sink upon .her hand, closed her eyes, and went off into one of those long, long reveries, apa- thies, or trances, whhichever they might be Called, into which she now so frequently fell. The rooms were now nearly empty, the company having nearly all departed.  Thurston Willcoxen still  &#xD;<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC7871-00000191"/> 896     T  E MSSIN    B R I D E. lingered about the halls and entries, until he ,saw Edith rouse Jacquelina, and with much tenderness coax and assist the ex- hausted girl to leave the room and retire to bed. Thefi seeing Marian left alone for a few minutes, he seized the precious op. -portunity, re-entered the saloon, and hurried to her side, drew her hastily to his bosom, pressed a kiss upon her lips, and say- ing, "Good night, sweetest and dearest-I will see you again to-morrow," hastened away in time to escape the observation of Mrs. Waugh, who came to look for Marian, and to show her to her room. The chamber to which Mrs. Waugh conducted , her guest, adjoined that occupied by Edith, and the door of communication was open between them. When Mrs. Waugh had bidden her good night, and left her to repose, Marian drew aside her curtains, and missed Miriam from the bed. Miriam, ever since her birth, had slept in Marian's arms; this night, the maid, Maria, had, naturally enough, put the little girl in her mother's bed, but when Marian missed her, she went immedi- ately into Edith's room, and, smilingly announcing that she had come for her baby, lifted the child, and carried her and laid her in her own bed. This, late as was the hour, opened a conver- sation between the friends, in the course of which they discussed the most striking events of the evening, the sudden arrival of Thurston, the strange behavior of Jacquelina, the great degree of adulation lavished upon Marian, and lastly, the meeting be- tween Edith and her long-estranged uncle. "My dear Marian," said Edith, " his conciliatory demon- strations were coarse, rude and offensive to me, an4 insulting to the memory of my husband. He excused his former harsh- ness, by reflecting severely upon my marriage,- and by implica- tion upon my martyred husband, which was very hard to bear, and it made me regret that I had entered the house. "Do not say so, dear Edith I his reflections cannot hurt the saint in Heaven, and need not offend you. You were right in coming. And now you must -remember that the old man, with all his years, is ignorant and blind, and you must bear with his faults; pity him, pray for him, and love him," said Marian, kissing Edith's cheek, and bidding her good night. ki ,.   dtl cheek   GOLDEN   OPINIONS.         3 When she re-entered her own chamber, what was her sur- prise to see Jacquelina in her white night-gown, with her yellow hair streaming around her, standing in the room. "My dear Lina! what is the matter? I thought you were asleep long ago." "I never sleep, Marian." ' Marian took her hand and made her sit down. upon a sofa and took a seat by her side, and- began, with a sort of instinctive mesmerism, to stroke her temples and smooth her hair.  "How did you get in, Lina?" she asked; \" my doorleading into the passage was locked." "But look there," replied Jacko, pointing to another door directly opposite to that leading into Edith's room. 'You did not notice that,--it communicates with my room. These three roolms are en suite, and were intended--hal ha ha I hal hal I for Professor and Mrs. Grimshaw.

Marian still calmly smoothed her hair, and betrayed no horror at her wild words, but answered gently, "They would not have driven you to such extremity, nor would you have committed such an act. Your lips betray the real goodness of your heart, Lina." "Don't call me 'Lina,' I can't bear it.

"'In the Spring af fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast; In the Spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest; In the Spring a livelier iris changes on the burnished dove; In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love."-Te nnyson, EARLY in the morning the carriage was brought to the door to take Edith and her party home. And after a hearty break-, fast, prepared by the orders of Mrs. Waugh for them alone, they took leave of that lady and departed. They drove first to i the village and left Marian at her school, and then towards Old Fields.                            I To Marian, how slowly passed that summer's morning. Thurston had promised to see her during the day; he had fixed no time nor place for doing so, so hastily had the appointment been made; but he knew where to find her school-room, and she half hoped, half feared, that despite the impolicy of the step, he might seek her there. And so she could not refrain   from watching through the windows the foot-path that led to  f the door. Through all the forenoon, through all the recess,  i and through the afternoon, she watched. But he came not. The longest day comes sometime or another to an end. And - at last Marian's work was finished, and her school dismissed. ! Not having her pony, Marian was obliged to walk home. She did not regret the circumstance, for the afternoon was lovely, and the walk home promised to be as delightful as clear June weather, evening skies, south breezes, and forest-paths could combine to make it. And more than all was the hope     and the fear of meeting Thurston. Yes, the hope and thefear; for though she desired above all things now to meet him, she by no means wished that the woodland and water-side walks of the preceding autumn should be renewed. And in Marian's (400)   SPRING   AND   LOVE.      401 once serene bosom, two principles, love and, prudence, were already at war with each other. She had not long to listen to the debate they kept up in her(-,s mind; for she had not walked many yards down the lonely forest footpath, leading from the village to Old Fields, before Thurs- ton suddenly -emerged from the trees and joined her. - She started and blushed deeply, but he joyfully caught her to his bosom, and kissed her till she dropped her head and hid her flushed cheelk upon his shouldei Then he began to speak- "My VMarian, my own Marian, my darling, my treasure- sweet wife, sweet life," and many fond epithets besides. "Look up--let me see your dear face--don't turn it away--it hasbeen so long absent from my eyes, though never from my heart. Look up now.": Marian raised her head and glanced at the face hanging over hers with so much love. That face had never seemed so in- stinct with life and light; so glorious with manly beauty as now. Involuntarily, pride, fondness, joy flowed to her countenance also, as she lifted her eyes to his for a brief instant ; but then- a sudden panic o6f cowardice overcame her, and down dropped her head again upon its resting place.' He pressed her closer to his heart, and pushed back her bonnet, and bent his face  upon her soft"and shining tresses. "I want to sit and talk to you so much. Come now. Let us go and find the mossy dell, fronrwhich I showed you, through the vista, that beautiful view of the- bay. I do not care for the view now, though never looked it lovelier.

He passed his right hand around Marian's shoulders, and drew her closer to his side, and with the other-hand began to untie her bonnet strings. "Lay off this little bonnet. Let me see your beauteous head uncovered. There!" he said, putting it aside, and smooth- ing. her bright locks. "Oh, Marian I my love I my queen! when I see only the top of your head, I think your rippling, sunny tresses your chief beauty; but soon my eyes fall to the blooming cheek-there never was such a cheek--so vivid, yet  i  so delicate, so glowing, yet so cool and fresh-like a damask ! rose bathed in morning dew--so when I gaze on it I think the - blushing cheek your sweetest charm-ah I but near by breathe the rich, ripe lips, fragrant as nectarines; and which I should i swear to be the very buds of love, were not my gaze caught up to meet your eyes-stars Hand then I know that I have found the very soul of beauty I Oh i priceless pearl I By what rare fortune was it that I ever found-you in these Maryland woods?

She would have spoken if she : could have done so; she would have said what was on her heart as earnest as a prayer to say, -'Oh, do not think so much of this perishable, outward X: beauty; accident may ruin it, sickness may injure it, time will  certainly impair it.

Love me for this heart."  But to have saved her own soul or his, Marian could not then have spoken those words. S  o he continued to caress her-every moment growing more and more enchante with her loveliness. There  was more-of passion than affection in his manner, and ;arian felt and re- gretted this, though her feeling was not a very clearly defined one-it was rather an instinct 'than a thought, and itwa latent, and quite subservient to her love for hinm. i"Love I angell how enchanting you are," he exclaimed, catching her in his arms. and pressing kisses on her cheek and lips and neck.           B  f         "a aGlowing with color, Marian strove to release herself. "Let me go--let us leave this place, dear Thurston," she pleaded, attempting to rise r "Why?  -Whyareyou in such a hurry? Why do you wish to leave me?" he asked, without releasing his hold. "It is late! Dear Thurstorni it is late," she said, in vague alarm.    -  That does not matter--I am with you." "They will be auxious about me, pray let us gol They will be so anxious!" she said, with increasing distress trying to get away. "Thurston I Thurston  You distress mebeyond mea sure," she exclaimed in great trouble. But he stopped her breath with kisses. Marian suddenly ceased to struggle, and by a strong effort of will she became perfectly calm. And lookingin his eyes, with her clear, steady gaze, she said,  "Thurston,.I have ceased to strive. But if yoou are a man of honor, you will release me." ,.                    ..  &#xD;<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC7871-00000195"/> 404     THE  M ISSIN G  B t IDE.  His arms dropped from around her as if he had been struck dead.           i.: ;: Glad to be free, Marian arose to depart. Thurston sat still --his fine countenance overclouded with mortification and anger. , Marian hesitated; she knew not how to proceed. He did not offer to rise and attend her. At length she spoke. "Will you see me safely through the woods, Thurston?" He did not answer, "Thurston, it is nearly dark--there are several runaway negroes in the forest now, and the road will not be safe for me." Thurston was silent and sullen. Good-night, then," she said. ' Good-night, Marian." She turned away and ascended the steps with her heart filled nearly to bursting with grief, indignation, and fear. That he should let her take that long, dark, dangerous walk alonel it was incredible I she could scarcely realize it, or believe it I Her unusually excited feelings lent wings to her feet, and she walked swiftly for about a quarter of a mile, and then was forced to pause and take breath. And then every feeling of indignation and fear was lost in that of sorrow, that she had wounded his feelings, and left him in anger. And Marian dropped her face into her open hands and wept. A step breaking through the brushwood made her start and tremble. She raised her head with the attitude of one prepared for a spring and flight. ItU was so dark she could scarcely see her hands before her, but as the step approached, a voice said, ' Fear nothing, Marian, I have not lost sight of you since you left me," and Thurston came up to her side. v With a glad smile of surprise Marian turned to greet him, holding out her hand, expecting him to draw it through his arm and lead heron. But no, he would not touch her hand. Lifting his hat slightly, he said, , "Go forward if you please to do so, Marian. I attend you." WMarian went on, and he followed closely. - They proceeded ia silence for some, time. Now that she knew that he had not           nwtth    a   o   SPRING   A ND  LOVE.       405 left her a moment alone in the woods, she felt more deeply grieved at having so mortified and offended him. At last sh?. spole. "Pray, do not be angry with me, dear Thurston."   A "I am not angry that I know of, fair one; and you do me too much honor to care about my mood. Understand me once for all. I am not a Doctor Grimshaw, in any phase of that gentleman's character. I am neither the tyrant who will perse- cute you to exact your attention, nor yet the slave who will follow and coax and whine and wheedle for your favor. In either character I should despise myself too much," he answered coolly. "Thurston, you are deeply displeased, or you Sould not speak so, and:I am very, very sorry," said Marian. in a tremu- lo'us voice. "Do not distress yourself about me, fair saint I I shall trouble you no more after this evening 1" What did he mean? What could Thurston mean? Trouble her no more after this evening She did not understand the words, but they went through her bosom like a sword. She did not reply-she could not. She wished to say, "Oh, Thurston, if you could read my heart-how singly it is' devoted to you--how its thoughts by day, and dreams by night are filled with histories and images of what I would be, and do or suffer for you--of how faithfully I mean to love and serve you in all our coming years-you would not mistake me, and get angry, because you would know my heart." But these words Marian could not have uttered had her life-depended on it. "Go on, Marian, the moor is no safer than the forest; I shall attend you across it." And they went on until the light from Old Field Cottage was - visible. Then Marian said,  "You had better leave me now. They are sitting up and watching for me."     . . "No I Go on; the -night is very dark. I must seeyon to the gate."  &#xD;<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC7871-00000196"/> They walked rapidly, and just as they approached the house, Marian saw a little figure wandering about on the moor, and which suddenly sprang towards her with an articulate cry of joy! It was Miriam, who threw herself upon Marian with such earnestness of welcome, that she did not notice Thurston, who now raised his hat slightly from his head, with a slight nod, and walked rapidly away. "Here she is, mother I Oh 1 here she' is !" cried Miriam, pullihig at Marian's dress, and drawing her in the house. " Oh I Marian, how anxious you have made us I Where have you been ?" asked Edith, in a tone half of love, half of vexation. " I have been detained," said Marian, in a low voice. The cottage room was very inviting. The evening was just chilly enough to make the bright little wood fire agreeable. On the clean hearth before it sat the tea-pot and a covered plate of toast waiting for Marian. And old Jenny got up and sat out a little stand, covered it with a white napkin, arid put the tea and toast, with the addition of a piece of cold chicken and a saucer of preserves upon it. And Marian laid off her straw bonnet and muslin scarf, and sat down and tried to eat, for affectionate eyes had already noticed the trouble of her counte- nance, and were watching her now with anxiety. "You do not seem to have an appetite, dear; what is the, matter?'" asked Edith. "I am not very well," said Marian, rising and leaving the table, and refraining with difficulty from bursting into tears. "It's dat ar cussed infunnelly party at Lockemup--dat's what it is I" said Jenny, as she cleared away the tea service-- "a-screwin' up tight in cusseds an' ball-dresses I an' a-dancin' all - ight till broad daylight l 'sides heavin' of ever so much un- wholesome 'fectionary trash down her t'roat-de constitution ob de United States hisself couldn't stan' sichi much less a delicy young gall!

Did you have to keep any of the girls in, or was it a visit from the trustees that detained you? i  "Neither," said Marian, nervously, but I think I must tak  : Jenny's advice and go to bed."            . Marian arose and lighted a candle, and bidding all good-night, went up stairs, followed by Miriam. She undressed the child and put her to bed, and then went to bed herself. She had  j been in the habit of drawing the little girl up to her bosom, and  going to sleep with her in her arms. But this night she kissed the child and turned over away from her, to be alone with her own thoughts-to review .what had passed that evening, and see what it was that she had done wrong to leave behind this dread- ful, dreadful aching of the heart-this insufferable sense of loneli- ness and desolation. She thought over all that had occurred, but : could not find herself guilty of any evil act or word that should have entailed this insupportable suffering. She knew that she had done right. Yet saying this over to herself, any number of times, did not tend to allay the heart-ache. She had so much longed for his return. Well! he had returned, and what was the  result to her? Why, that they were more estranged than when the Atlantic had divided them, and she was more unhappy than she had ever been in all her life before. Their parting, and the a months of separation, had never grieved her as this estrange- ment did-ohI nothing like it!"After this evening I will trouble you no more," he had said. Ah I what did he mean by- that? What was the extent of his, meaning? Sigh after sigh agitated her bosom-tear after tear swelled under her eyelids, and slid down her cheeks, until the pillow under her face was wet  with them. So engrossed was she by her own grief, that she  did not notice that her sighs were echoed from the little bosom , of the child by her side. She did not even know that Miriam- was awake, until at last she felt a little hand pass softly over her -A face and feel her eyes, and a little sad voice say, "What is the matter, Marian? Please don't cry. I love you  so much . ", Then Marian suddenly turned over, and gathered the childtA her bosom as nusal, but saying,  '            i  &#xD;<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC7871-00000197"/> 408     THE  MSSIN G   BRIDE. i*"My darling-how selfish in me to turn away from my loving hild. And have you been lying awake, watching with me, qtle one? Couldn't you sleep out of Marian's arms? Well, then, now close your dark eyes, and go to sleep." "But will you go to sleep, too, Marian?' "Yes, love, I will try. Never mind my tears-something troubled me, this evening, but it is nothing that should vex you, or that you can help at all, so go to sleep." Miriam was an obedient little creature, and never dreamed of disputing Marian's directions, so she closed her eyes, and lay perfectly still, while Marian put a strict guard upon herself, that no tear or sigh should escape her, and disturb the child. But, oh, how she longed to go and weep in some solitary place, where her tears might fall without dropping upon and blistering another heart. At last the blessing "God give-th his beloved," fell upon both maiden and child. So that when Edith came up to bed, and ap- proached them with a shaded candle, she found them fast asleep, still locked in each other's arms. She did not look closely enough to see that Marian's face was pale, and the tear-drops were hanging on her eyelashes, nor did she stay long enough to note the frequent shuddering sighs that shook her bosom. Marian's grief had followed her into the land of dreams. And when she awoke in the morning, it was the first thing that met her in the world of reality. It was with a heavy and an anxious heart -that she arose and dressed herself, partook of a slight breakfast and set out for school. Miriam, who had stayed home the day before, to rest herself after the party, now accompanied her. They rode the pony- Miriam sitting upon the crupper, behind. As they reached the cross-roads, at the entrance of the woods, Marian's eager gaze went in all directions, in the vain hope of seeing Thurston near their old trysting place. 'ie was nowhere in sight, and with a heart that grew every moment heavier, Marian rode on, looking wistfully up the path, longing for his appearance. Yesterday afternoon, coming along this very path, she had   SPRING   AND  LOVE-       409 both hoped and feared to meet him. But now the instinct of prudence was entirely lost in the anxiety she felt to see him and be friends with him again. They rode the whole distance d and reached the school-room without having met one single being. It were tedious to tell how heavily passed that day to Marian. But one faint hope sustained her-that of seeing Thurston on her way home again. At last the school was dis- missed, and she and Miriam set out for the-cottage. She rode very slowly, frequently looking before, anditurning to look be- hind, but there was no one to, be seen. So slowly she rode, that it was after sunset when they reached Old Fields., And- Edith said,  "Indeed I would not make a slave of myself, and keep the school in so late, Marian. If the pupils didn't know-their les- soilns, they might go home without saying them, for me." But Marian turned away in mournful silence, more heart-sick than before-wishing more than ever for some solitary place, where she might weep unnoticed and unquestioned. As passed this day, so passed the next one-beginning in the same feverish anxiety-ending in- the same heavy disap- p ointment. Friday came. "Surely, surely Thurston will see me to-day," she said, as she set out for the school-" he knows that it is Friday, and that to-morrow there will be no opportunity." She said this over so many times,.that she persuaded herself it must be as she wished. And never had the hours seemed to' drag so wearily as upon this last day. And when she set out to walk home, leading little Miriam, it was with the vigilant impatience of one certazin-yet in anxious haste to meet him' whom she sought. But every mile that brought her nearer, home, weighed down her heart, and when, at last, without having seen him, she reached Old Fields, she entered the house, and without stopping to speak to-,Edith, passed up stairs, sank on her knees by the bedi buried her face in the coverlet, and gave wayto a convulsive fit of grief. The gust  &#xD;<pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC7871-00000198"/> "O     THE  M SS I NG   BRIDE. of tears and sobs-relieved her overcharged bosom, and then she *at down and tried to reason with herself. "What is this that has come over my life, and' taken from me the control of my own fate and peace of mind? A little while ago I did not know Thurston-my life was perfect in itself without him. I stood upon my own feet-strong, happy, calm, self-possessed and self-reliant-supporting myself and supporting others-needing no comfort, yet able to comfort others-lone but free!--now, heart and soul and spirit-all that is best of me-have gone out of my own possession, and into another's--and peace that nothing could disturb before, is now at the mercy of another's smile or frown. Should -this be so? Is this worthy of an intellectual-an immortal being? No, no I no, no I it must not be I I who have done no wrong, must indulge no vain regrets. I who have lectured others, must now ' reck my own rede.'"  It was very easy so to reflect and so to resolve, just after her heart had been relieved and exhausted by a hearty fit of weep- ing-and acting in the new strength, Marian arose, bathed her face, smoothed her hair, arranged her dress, and went below stairs, where, in the keeping-room, the tea-table was just set, while the tea-kettle sung upon the hearth. It was a comfortable, cheering scene, and Marian resolved to enjoy it as she had been accustomed to do. And during the pleasant little bustle; of the tea-table, she succeeded well enough, but when that was all over, and she took her needle- work to sit down by the little stand and sew, the tide of love and grief: began to flow back upon her heart, filling her bosom with longings impossible to silence. And she bent lower and lower over her work, and turned farther and farther from the light, as tear after tear gathered under her white lids and stole down her cheeks. At, last, unable longer to suppress an out- break of sorrow, she arose hastily, folded up her work, and with a brief good-night to Edith, hurried up the stairs. Edith looked after her in anxiety. "I wonder what is the matter with Marian?" she said.   SPRING   AND    LOVE.      4" "Dom ar wexatious, aggroawokin' school, galls dems um !

"What is it then that troubles you, Marian?"       i "I am out of spirits, Edith. But I have one favor to beg of you-will you grant it to me?" "Of course I will, Marian. I promise you blindly before you tell me what it is."                - "It is that you will never question me as to the cause of my : moods."

"Dear Edith, forgive me, but you know one has sometimes variable spirits, imaginary troubles, if you please to call them so-fantastical ones, if you like that term better-but which they are half ashamed to own, and cannot brook to display. I hope you understand me, and are not offended with me, Edith." "She has permitted herself to form an unhappy attachment," thought Edith, stumbling very near the truth. And from that time forth for many weeks Edith forbore to question Marian. The next day, Saturday, Marian busied her hands with many domestic duties, and reasoned with her heart and struggled for composure and cheerfulness. But all the philosophy she could bring to her aid failed to comfort her as much as one little hope -that of seeing him at church the next day. "I shall be sure to see him there, and then I shall know what all this means. Yes, then I shall know my fate. And any- thing is better than this suspense. Oh, that to-morrow were come 1" The Sabbath/dawned at last-a beautiful, a glorious day, the first Sunday in June. Neither Edith nor Miriam went from home that morning, but Marian sat out early for the village. She walked rapidly until she reached the cross-roads, where Thurston had so often waited to join her-then she slackened her pace, and looked around-still expecting to see him some- where near. But he was nowhere visible. She walked slowly through the woods, still hoping to be overtaken; but in vain. "Welll no matter-I shall see him at church--I know I shall see him at church," said she, quickening her walk. 'She soon reached the village, and hastened to the chapel, where she arrived barely in time to meet her Sunday school class. She still felt sure of seeing Thurston at church, and her impatience made the morning session of the Sunday school the longest two hours she had ever spent in her life. At length it wFas over, and the pupils were dismissed, and the teachers went into their pews. Marian sought her own, and sat down and opened her prayer- book to mark the lessons and psalms and collects for the day; but her eyes would wander from her book to the doors through which the congregation was continuously pouring into the aisles.   SPR IN   AND   LOVE.      41t But Thurston appeared not- among them.   Still-still she watched and hoped. The church was at length filled-the, organ played the prelude--the minister appeared in the aisle-- walked slowly up, ascended the steps leading into the pulpit- opened the book and commenced the services by giving out the opening hymn. The sacred song was sung--the first prayer followed, and still the watched-for came not. The second hymn , and the litany succeeded, and yet he came not. The Bible was opened, the text taken, and the sermon commenced, and Marian resigned all hope of seeing him that day either. And oh l who can conceive the soul-sickness that prevented her from' hearing one word of the discourse that followed. The morning service was at last over; but Marian could not have told the subject of the sermon if she had been asked. While the congregation was dispersing, Miss Thornton ap- proached Marian.             .     ' "You walked here, I believe, my dear Miss Mayfield?" "Yes,'" said Marian. "It was a lovely morning; and I pre- ferred to walk.^" "Will you do us the pleasure, my dear, to go home with Us and dine 1 It will give my brother -and myself the greatest de- light if you will. We shall return to church in the afternoon, so that you need not miss the evening seviices." "I thank you sincerely for your kindness, Miss Thornton, but I have a class of colored children that I meet at nooln," said Marian, pressing the lady's hand.. "But you should not do that, my dear. You really ove-, work yourself. Marian, you are losing the roses from yotir cheeks. Even you, incredible as it seems. That will- not ldo, my dear," said Miss Thornton, looking with anxious affectton in Marian's face; "Ao, that will not do. Really, Miss Naney Skamp should take that class of little negroes off your -hin;ds,- It would just suit such an old body as herself, and Itiidk she ought to'offer to0do it.

"I do not think Miss Nancy quite fitted for the task, and as for me, work, evQn hard, continuous work, agrees with me. But you are very kind, Miss Thornton, and the interest you are good enough to take in me, helps to make out my sum of hap- piness," said the young girl, warmly.  A  "Ah, Marian, if you would but make such an answer to my brother-if you would but let the interest he takes in you make you happy 1 If you would but listen to him." "Your brother does me unmerited honor, Miss Thornton." Here the approach of the lady's carriage put an end to the conversation. She kissed Marian and entered her coach. Before the lady's carriage had rolled away, Marianxre-entered the church to assemble her little class. She felt a strong temp- tation to leave them, and walk about the village, to breathe the fresh air, and possibly to catch a glimpse iof Thurston some- where. But she resisted the desire, and gave herself up to the duties in hand. And if there had been a time that week when the weight and pain were lightened from her heart, it was while she was engaged in this work of charity. Her class was dis- missed half-an-hour before the time for afternoon service to commence.: And that half-hour was occupied by friends and acquaintances who came to shake hands; chat and laugh before going in to take their seats in church. At last Marian was free, and with her eyes cast sadly down to the floor, walked up the aisle and entered her pew and kneeled down for her private prayer, as is the custom among Episcopalians. When she arose to turn and sit down, her eyes fell upon Thurston, seated in a pew opposite. She started, and could scarcely repress an ex- clamation of joy as she saw him, She sat down, and kept her eyes a moment on him. -He did not raise his to look towards :- her; he sat with his fine head a little thrown back, and his eyes fixed upon the minister. Marian heard scarcely one word the holy man said; she glanced from time to time at Thurston, but he seemed totally unconscious of her presence-handsome, cheer- ful, nonchalant, and turning his careless glance from the minis- ter's face, to rest a moment upon some pretty girl, or quaintly   SPRING   AND   LOVE.      416 dressed old woman, or some other object of trivial, passing in- terest or curiosity, but never by any chance towards Marian's pew. Her mental distress was beginning to make itself felt in phye sical suffering-in the filling and rising of her heart, the chok- ing sensation in her throat, the fullness and throbbing of her head-the dimness of her eyes-the dizziness of her brain, that made the whole scene swim before her-the faintness, that caused her nearly to drop. All these things she had to strug- gle against, during the whole of that afternoon service. At last, while the congregation were on their knees for the final prayer, Marian arose softly, and silently withdrew from the church. She could not bear that any one should see or speak to her in her present state-as would have been the case had she waited the dismissal of the congregation. She drew her veil over her face and left the church door. A little while she stopped, and leaned against the wall to gather strength, and then hearing the people in the church be- ginning to move, and fearing they were coming out, she hurried away-anywhere.-anywhere where solitude would give her the liberty to weep unnoticed and unquestioned. He had known that she was in the church, and had not once looked towards her--she thought-oh I he really meant it then--meant what he had said-meant not to see her again after that first evening. The thought had the sting of death in it for her-anything, anything, rather than such an estrangement. There could be no such bitter suffering in lany other/lot of sorrow. Nearly in- sane with grief, and blind with tears, and fainting with weari- ness, she tottered on through the forest-path. Unwilling to go home and be seen and inevitably questioned by some one, and needing some secluded spot to sit down and rest her wearied frame, and weep unnoticed, Marian stopped, and turned to look drearily and sadly around her. She had reached the' spot where the little-by-path led to the mossy dell-a fond fascination drew her down that path. ;It would be some comfort to sit there upon the mossy rocks, among ,              i '         '.i  &#xD;<pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC7871-00000201"/> "6     THE   MSSING   B R IDE. the sweet violets, under the dear old trees, doubly beloved now as the confidants of their love. She reached the spot, stepped down the mossy stairs, and seated' herself at the foot. A picture, matchless in beauty and glory, was spread out before her-the rolling country, green with the brilliant verdure tf :June. The distant bay, clear and blue as molten sapphire --the western horizon, with the sun setting behind a bank of clouds, like a range of golden mountains, whose peaks were all ablaze with his last rays. But Marian saw nothing of this-dropping her weary head upon her hands, she gave way to the burden of grief that had been bowing her down all this time, and burst into a fit of tears and sobs that shook her whole frame. She wept long and heartily, but the tears did not seem to relieve her as usual-they left the aching, aching sorrow still at the bottom of her heart. CHAPTER XXXI. TH AT NIGHT. "How goes the night in the widow's cot? Are the blinds safe closed 2 Does the hearth shine clear? Are they jesting together, while she, forgot, Links every thought with a falling tear." MEANWHLE, Edith sat by her cottage window, musing and gazing out upon the rolling, open country, the calm bay, and the range of golden cloud mountains, whose-peaks were all ablaze with the setting sun. Old Jenny came in with an armful of light wood, to kindle the fire. "I tell yer all whatl " she said, dropping her load upon the hearth, and taking breath, "'Sam's gwine to be let loose to- night, 'deed he lt Sich anudder eloed arisin'  Lord I I pity de   THAT -NIGHT.           41rt crafts as 'ill be out on de water dis night,'deed me!

"Miriam, why are you moping so?': Poor child I it s lone- some for you these Sundays at home, without playmates, or books, or anything to help the time on pleasantly," said Edith, to the little girl, who stood gazing sadly from the window. "It is not that, mother. Marian walked to church to-day,: and--I am looing at that cloud."  "True, child, it does rise very fast. I wish she were safe . home." Old Jenny had hung the kettle over the blazing fire, and: laidA the spider and spider-lid up against the front to get heated;: and she now stood at the table with her hands wrist-deep ins the dough, and while she kneaded and worked up and twisted off and formed the mass into biscuits, and while Edith sat and. - mused, and Miriam stood and gazed- from the window, the cloud arose higher and blacker and overspread the whole sky. ::. "Miss Mirie, honey, jest you light me a candle, will yert?:- it's a gittin' mos' as dark as midnight," said Jenny, looking around from her work.

And the little girl wen( and opened the blind. But just then an awful peal of thunder broke, rolling, crash. ing, and vibrating through the sky, accompanied by a flash of blinding lightning, and followed by a deluge of rain. With a suppressed scream Miriam started from the window, old Jenny sprang away from the fire-place, and Edith rose to her feet with clasped hands. For a moment the three stood gazing in silence at each other. Then came another blinding glare of lightning, another deaf- ening crash of thunder, and then Miriam sprang to the door to open it. "What are you doing, child? Has the storm put you out of your wits?" asked Edith, starting to her side and catching her arm. "Oh I I must--I must go see where Marian is, I can't-I can't stay here while she is out," cried the child. Another blaze of lightning-another peal of thunder, and Edith shuddering, locked the door and withdrew the key, doubt- ing her moral power to keep the half-delirious child from flying out in search of her friend. "Oh, you've locked her out in the storm 1!" cried Miriam, wringing her hands. "No, dear. I have no idea that Marian is out in the storm now. Heaven forbid. Seeing the cloud arising, she probably went home with Miss Thornton -to spend the night. She-", A glare of light as if all the heavens had suddenly burst into flame, accompanied by an explosion, whose tremendous shock seemed to shake the very foundations of the earth, and followed by a fall of water as if the fountains of the great deep had been broken up, and the windows of heaven opened for another flood! Edith sank down upon a low chair and drew Miriam close to her bosom. Jenny was crouched upon a stool in the middle of the floor, muttering her prayers. "Mother, oh, mother, are you sure she is safe?" whis' pered Miriam, upon her mother's bosom.  THAT  USIA  T  . T"         o 1 "Yes, sure, , y dear-she would else have been here long ago."  The thunder still rolled--the lightning still glared-the rain still poured through many hours.  At last, towards midnight, the storm began to abate, andthe frightenedinmates of the cottage ventured to look up and speak to each other. "Jes  ' tell you what-heap o' dammidge done dis er' night, a MissEdif. Well I thank Marster." Miriam? raised 1er head from her mother'streast, and looked at Jennyin so much astonishment, that the old woman hastened to say, "Not as der wer so much damnmidge donej honey, but a-eaze we-dem's safe. Now, den, asit's done lightenin' I'll jes' go an' see inter de state o' dese biscuits," and she went to the fire- place, took up the tongs and lifted the lid off the spider, but  immediately dropped it with an ejaculation of terror as another flash of lightning blazed into the room, and another pealof thunder rolled over the roof.     -           i "Dar I Lord a massy upon me, what anybody t'ink o' dat  Sam trought he done hab dis chile dat time, 'deed he!

And the moon, like a goddess ofpeace, emerged from the clouds, and all was calm.^ "tNow, I think you-may go to the fire-place without deageri Jenny," said her mistress. And the old woman again approached the hearthtoo, inves- tigate the condition of their supper. The biscuits ,were baked hard, and had grown nearly cold, as had also the water iw' the tea-kettle, for the fire was almost out. However,Jenny ramp the brands together, and soon kindled a bright blaze, and s'  ,after had the tea smoking on the table. #     : .  &#xD;<pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC7871-00000203"/> 420     THE   MSSING   BRIDE.  But the little family had been too much disturbed and fax tigued to eat; the supper was little better than a mere form, and it was soon dispatched, and the service cleared away. They fastened the doors and windows, and went up stairs to bed. But long after Edith was asleep, little Miriam lay awake watching and listening. The full moon shone brightly into the chamber.        The head of Miriam's bed was against the wall, one side of the window looking out upon the, bay; but the foot was towards the opposite window that looked landward, and commanded the old fields and the belt of forest and the cross roads. And the child, as she lay, kept her eyes open and strained through that window, as though it were possible to discern a figure approach- ing from that distance, or as though it were likely that Marian would come home at that, late hour. Miriam did not certainly think she would, though, with strange inconsistency, she watched and listened for her doming, and could not close her eyes in sleep. At last her ear caught the sound of a light step, near the front door, and then she heard a gentle rap, and a soft voice, saying, "It is I, Jenny." "Miss Marian I Marster!" said Jenny, getting up from her pallet on the kitchen floor, and fumbling at the door-lock until she had it open, and admitted Marian. "Marster's dear, sake, chile! who come home wid yer? Where is yer been? Is yer wet? Did yer-get ketched in de storm? Marster 'Deemer I how pale yer, does look, chile I Come, sit down to de fire, while I rakes up de chunks, an' makes you siummat hot."' "Elush-no, I'm not chilled, and don't wish anything, thank ou,'t' said Marian, passing through the room, where she left Jenny standing in her amazement, and going quietly up stairs. There she found Miriam awake and waiting for her. The child had raised up on her elbow, and her large, dark, melan- ghlyleyes were fixed in surprise, grief, and anxiety upon her friend   THAT  NIGHT.          421- "Marian, were you out in the storm?" she, asked. "No, love, I was under shelter, and now I am safe at home, but it is too late for your sweet eyes to be open. Go to sleep, love," said Marian, approaching the bed and :kissing. the little girl, and laying her down upon the pillow.- Then she quickly prepared herself and lay down beside her; but the child, who had kept her eyes upon her all the while, said now, in a voice of surprise, "Marian, you forgot to say your prayers!' With something like a shiver, Marian arose and knelt down. So long she remained upon her knees that the watchful child&amp; at last began to suspect, that, overcome with weariness, she had, fallen asleep.          - She crept closer to her and put out her hand, and then' she: found Marian's face and hands wet with tears. She wiped and kissed away those tears, and whispered softly the best words of) comfort she could think of:- "I love you, Marian, I love you so much." And Marian, shocked and repentant that her grief should so overshadow this child's young life, made a desperate effort to,. conquer the weakness, dashed away her tears, and smiling said, "Never mind me, love. I have been low spirited-and tired out-all persons are at times--but it will wear off-it shall-it must," she added, mentally, as once more she lay down and drew- the child's head upon her bosom. * . But Marian found it a severe struggle. Many nights, suc- ceeding this, little Miriam, lying awake, would put: up her hand to- feel if Marian's eyes were sleeping or weeping, and, finding. them wet with tears, would kiss those tears away. And manay  days Edith's anxious glance would follow Marian through thei house, and her earnest questioning harrass and embarrass her: not a little. But Marian had been too long the ruiing.,sptwr#L that house, not to command respect and observance wher t: wished it. And Edith had too long been accustomed t[eI up to the young girl, to depend upon her, to be guided by3l  to now intrude upon her confidence when she had once:$;.tt? 35-  &#xD;<pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC7871-00000204"/> "No." And so, after Marian had answered her anxious in- quiries with "'You cannot understand nor help me, dear Edith., You must perforce leave me to myself,"' Edith desisted forever. But Miriam, with the instinct of devoted love, watched over her friend. Have you ever had occasion to notice the helpless piteous dismay with which children look upon the grief of grown people, whom they vainly try to comfort, yet despair of comfort- ing? Such was Miriam's sympathy for her young nurse, as she watched her paling cheeks and fading eyes, and failing step, and could find no other way of consoling than by caressing and assuring her. "I love you, Marian, I love you dearly 1" From that miserable night, Marian saw no more of Thurston, except occasionally at church, when he came at irregular inter- vals, and maintained the same coolness and distance of manner towards her, and with matchless self-command, too, since often his heart yearned towards her with almost irresistible force. Cold and calm as was his exterior, he was suffering not less than Marian; self-tossed with passion, thestrong currents and counter-currents of his soul whirled as a moral maelstrom, in which both reason and conscience threatened to be engulfed. And in these mental conflicts judgment and understanding were often obscured and bewildered, and the very boundaries of right and wrong lost. His appreciation of Marian wavered with his moods. :: When very angry he would mentally denounce her -as a cold, prudent, calculating woman, who had entrapped him into a secret marriage, and having secured his hand, would now risk nothing for his love, and himself as a weak, fond fool, the tool of the beautiful, proud diplomate, whom it would be justifiable to circumvent, to defeat, and to humble in some way. At such. times he felt a desire, amounting to a strong temp- tation, to abduct her-to get, her into his power, and make her feel that power. No law could protect her or punish him--for they were married. I But here was the extreme point at which reaction- generally    TH  AT -NIGHET           g commenced, for Thurston could not contemplate himself in that  character-playing such a part, for an instant. And -then when a furtive' glance would show him Marian's angel face, fairer and paler and more pensive than ever before -a strong counter-current of love and admiration approaching to worship, would -set in, and he would look upon her as a fair saint worthy of translation to Heaven, and upon himselfas' designing but foiled conspirator, scarcely one degree above the most atrocious villain. "Currents and counter-currents"-of tormy passion, where is the pilot that shall -guide the under- standing safely through them? It is no wonder that once in a while, a mind is wrecked. Marian, sitting in her, pew saw nothing in his face or manner to indicate that inward storm. She only saw the sullen, freez- ing exterior. Even in his softened moods of penitence, Thurs- ton dared not seek her society. For Marian had begun to recover from the first abject pros- tration of her sorrow, and her fair resolute- brow and sad firm lips mutely assured him, that she never would consent to be his own, until their marriage could be proclaimed. And he durst not trust himself in her tempting presence,: lest there should be a renewal of those humiliating scenes he had endured. Thus passing a greater portion of the summer; during which Thurston gradually dropped off ftom the church, and from all other haunts where he was likely to encounter Marian, and as  gradually began to frequent the Catholic chapel, .and to visit Luckenough, and to throw himself as much as possible into the, distracting company of the pretty elf Jacquelina. But this- while it threw Doctor, Grimshaw almost into frenzy, did not: help Thurston to forget the good and beautiful Marian. Indeed  by contrast it seemed to make her more excellent and lovely. And thus, while Jacquelina fancied she had a new admirer,: Dr. Grimsbaw feared that he had a new rival, and the holy: fathers hoped they had a new convert--Thurston laughed: a the vanity of the elf, the jealousy of the Ogre, and the gu!li'- &#xD;<pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC7871-00000205"/> 124     THE  MXISSING   BRIDE. bility of the priests--and sought only escape from the haunting memory of Marian, and found it not. And finally, bored and ennuied beyond endurance, he cast about for a plan by which to hasten his union with Marian. Perhaps it was only that neighborhood shel was afraid of, he thought-perhaps in some other place she would be less scrupulous. Satan had no sooner whispered-this thought to Thurston's ear, than he conceived the design of spending the ensuing autumn in Paris-and of making Marian his companion while there. Fired with this new idea and thisew w hope, he sat down and wrote her a few lines-without address or signature-as follows: "Dearest, forgive all the past. I was mad and blind. I have a plan to secure at once our happpiness. Meet me in the Mossy dell, this evening, and let me explain it at your feet." Having written this note, Thurston scarcely knew how to get it, at once, into Marian's hands. To put it'into the village post-office was to expose it to the prying eyes of Miss Nancy Skamp. To send it to Old Fields, by a messenger, was still more hazardous. To slip it into Marian's own hand, he would have to wait the whole week until Sunday-and then might not be able to do so unobserved. Finally, after much thought, he determined, without admit- ting the elf into his full confidence, to entrust the delivery of the note to Jacquelina. He therefore copied it into the smallest space, rolled it up tightly, and took it with him when he went to Luckenough. He spent the whole afternoon at the mansion house, without having an opportunity to slip it into the hands of Jacquelina. It is true that Mrs. Waugh was not present, that good woman being in the back parlor, sitting at one end of the sofa - and making a pillow of her lap for the Commodore's head, which she combed soporifically, while, stretched at full length, he took his afternoon nap. But Mary L'Oiseau was there, quietly knotting a toilet cover, and Professor Grimshaw was there, scowling behind a book that he was pretending to read, and losing no word or look or tone or gesture of Thurston or      THA T NIGHT.   Jacquelina, who talked and laughed and flirted and jested, as i if there was no one else in the world but themselves.  At last a little negro appeared at the door, to summon Mrs. L'Oiseau to give out supper, and Mary arose and left the room. The Professor scowled at Jacquelina from over the top of his book for a little while, and then, muttering an excuse, got up and went out, and left them alone together. That was a very common trick of the doctor's lately, and no one could imagine why he did it. "It is a ruse, a trap, the grim idiot! to see what we will say to each other behind his back. Oh, IPd dose him I just wish Thurston would kiss me I I do so 1" thought Jacquelina. "Thurston," and the elf leaned towards her companion, and began to be as bewitching as she knew how. But Thurston was not thinking of Jacquelina's mischief, though without intending it he played directly into her hands. Rising, he took his hat, and saying that his witching little cousin had beguiled him into breaking one engagement already, advanced to take leave of her. "Jacquelina," he said, lowering his voice, and slipping the note for Marian into her hand, " may I ask you to deliver this to Miss Mayfield, when no one is by?" A look of surprise and perplexity, followed by a nod of in- telligence was her answer. And Thurston, with a grateful smie, raised her hand to his lips, took leave and departed. "I wonder what it is all about? I could easily untwist and read it, but I woul! not do so for a kingdom!" said Jaeko to - herself as she turned the tiny note about in her fingers. "Hand me that note, madam "' said Doctor Grimshaw, in curt and husky tones, as, with a stern brow, he stood before her. "No, sir it was not intended for you," she said, mockingly. "By the demons, I know that! Hand it here" '" "Don't swear nor get angry 1 Both are unbecoming a Pro  fessor!" said the elf, with mocking gravity. 35* &#xD;<pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC7871-00000206"/> 426     THE   MSSING   BRIDE. - "Perdition! owill you give it up?" stamped the doctor, in a fury. "Perdition,' no ;" mocked the fairy. "Hand it here, I command you, madam!" cried the Pro. fessor, trying to compose himself and recover his dignity. "Command away--I like to hearyou: Command a regiment if you like!" said the elf. "Give it up!" thunderedthe Professor, losing his slight hold upon self-control. "Couldn't do it, sir," said Jacko, gravely. "It is an appointment, you impudent  Hand it here." Not as you know of!" laughed Jacko, tauntingly shaking it over her head. He made a rush to catch it. She sprang nimbly away, and clapped the paper into,her mouth. He  overtook and caught her by the arm, and shaking her roughly, exclaimed, under his breath, "Where is it?  What have you done with it? You exas- perating, unprincipled little wretch, where is it?"' "' Echo anfers fere?' mumbled the imp, chewing up the ,paper, and keeping her lips tight. "Give it me I give it me I or I'll be the death of you, you diabolical little !" he exclaimed, hoarsely, shaking her as if he would have- shaken her breath out. But Jacko had finished chewing up the paper, and- she swal- lowed the pulp with an effort that nearly choked her, and then opening her mouth, and inflating her chest, gave voice in a succession of piercing shrieks, that brought the whole family rushing into the room, and obliged the Professor to relax his hold, and stand like a detected culprit. For there was the Commodore roused up from his sleep, with his gray hair and beard standing out all ways, like the picture of the sun in an almanac. And there was Mrs. Waugh, with the great tooth comb in her hand. ; And Mary L'Oiseau, with the pantry keys. And the maid, Maria, with the wooden tray   THAT    NIGHT.        427 of flour on her head. And Festus, with a bag of meal in his hands. And all with their eyes and ears and mouths agape with -amazement and inquiry. "In the fiend's name, what's--the matter? What the d-l's broke loose? Is the house on fire again?" vociferated the Commodore, seeing that no one else spoke " what's, all this about, Nace Grimshaw?" "Ask your pretty niece, sir t" said the Professor, sternly, turning away. "Oh, it's you, is it, you little termagant you? Oh, you're a honey-cooler. What have you been doing now, Imp?" cried the old man, turning fiercely to Jacquelina. "Answer me, you little vixen Hwhat does all this mean?" "Better ask 'the gentlemanly Professor' why he seized and nearly shook the head off my shoulders and the breath out of my bosom!" said Jacquelina, half-crying, half-laughing. L The Comnmodore turned furiously towards Grim'. Shaking a woman's head off her shoulders, and breath out of her body, in his house, did not suit his ideas of gallantry at all, rough as he was. "By heaven i are you mad, sir? What have you been doing? I never laid the weight of my hand on Jacquelina in all my life, wild as she has driven me at times.- Explain your bru- tality, sir." "It was to force from her hand a paper which she has swal- lowed," said Doctor Grimshaw, with-.stern coldness regarding the group. "Swallowed I swallowed!" shrieked Mrs. Waugh, rushing towards Jacqixelina, and seizing one of her- arms, and, gazing in her face, thinking only of poisons, and of Jack0's frequent threats of suicide. "Swallowed I swallowed I Whiere did she get it? Who procured it for her? What was it? Oh, run for the doctor, somebody. What are you all standing like you were thunderstruck for?

How-can you have the heart to stand there and not go for a physician?" said Mrs. Waugh, while Mary L'Oiseau looked on mute with terror, and the Commodore stood with his fat eyes protruded nearly to bursting. "Go, oh, go, Dr. Grimshaw!" insisted Mrs. Waugh. "I assure you it is not necessary, madam," said the Professor, with stern- scorn. "There is no danger, aunty- I haven't taken any poison since I took a dose of Grim' before the altar l" said Jacko through her tears and laughter. t' What have you taken then, unfortunate child?" "I have swallowed an assignation," said the elf, as grave as  a judge.  ma WHAT iX exclaimed all, in a breath. "An assignation," repeated Jacko, with owl-like calmness and solemnity.

" e-says.-I- swallowed-alp-assignation-wAhole!" re- peated Jacquelina, with distinct emphasis.

"Mr. Thurston Willcoxen was here this afternoon on a visit to your niece, sir. In taking leave he Slipped into her hand a small note, which, when I demanded, she refused to let me see."  "And very properly, too. What right had you to make such a ' demand 7"' said Mrs. Waugh, indignantly. "I was not addressing my remarks to you, madam," retorted the Professor.                      : That will not keep me from malking a running commentary upon them, however," responded the lady. "Hold your tongue, Henrietta. Go on Nace. I swear you are enough to drive a peaceable man mad between you," said the Commodore, bringing his stick downemphatically. "Well, what next?"  "On my attempting to take it from her she put it in ner mouth and swallowed it." "Yes 1 and then he seized me and shook me, as if I hadbeen a fine bearing little plum tree in harvest time." "And served you right, I begin to think, you little limb you. What was it you had, you little hussy'?" "An assignation he says, and he ought to know-being a Professor.  .

Thurston has no more idea of falling in love with little Jacko than he has with her mother or Henrietta, not a bit more." And then the Com- modore happening to turn his attention to the two gaping ne. groes, with a flourish of his stick sent them about their business, and left the room. ' 'Th6e next evening Thurston repaired to the mossy dell in the expectation of seeing Marian, who of course did not make her appearance. The morning after, filled with disappointment and mortifying conjecture as to the cause of her non-appearance, Thurston presented himself before Jacquelina at Luckenough. He hap- pened to find her alone. . With all her playfulness of character, the poor fairy had too much self-respect to relate the scene to which she had been exposed the day before. So she cotented herself with saying,'  "I found no opportunity of delivering your note, Thurston, and so I thought it best to destroy it." "I thank you.  Under the circumstances that was best," re- plied the young man, much relieved. He then arose, bade her good-day, and departed with the resolution of writing to Marian, and placing the letter in her own hands at church. He reached home, set down and wrote a long and eloquent epistle, implor- ing her forgiveness for his rashness and folly, assuring her of his continued love and admiration; speaking of the impossibility of living longer without her society-informing her of his in- tention to go to Paris, and proposing that she should either precede or follow him thither, and join him in that city. It was her duty, he urged, to follow her husband. This was the main point of his argument, and he did not fail to enforce it with all the plausibility and power and eloquence that love and logic could inspire and teach, nor fail to wrest many texts of Scripture from their spiritual truth, and lug them in to support his cause. When Thurston had finished and read-over his let- ter, he was marvelously well pleased with his work. "'She cannot resist this appeal No, she cannot do it I If   THAT   NIGHT.         431 she is the Christian woman she professes to be, she cannot :re fuse to go with me," he said triumphantly, as he folded and sealed the letter, and put it in his pocket to take with him to church. He felt perfectly confident of its success, as he con- trived to approach Marian in the crowd and slip it unobserved in her hand. Marian'smind had recovered its wonted toneq of strength and calmness, yet this letter shook all her nature again, and for a time nearly threw into chaos her notions of right and wrong upon this subject. It was several days before she felt sufficiently calm and collected to trust herself to answer it. She saw nothing of Thurston during the week. But on Sunday after church she placed her answer in his hands. He hurried to thie inn and found a room to read it. He broke the seal and commenced. The letter was characteristic of Marian-clear, firm, frank and truthful. It concluded thus:-- "I will not speak of what I have sufferd, dear Thurston-. you must have seen how long-none but the Searcher of hearts knew how deeply. Enough that I accepted the :sorrow in. all humility. Enough that that miserable and abject weakness has passed, and my mind has recovered its tone. I feel stronger, more patient, more hopeful and more trustful for you and my-: self, and for our future lives.

The village post-office was . kept in the lower front room of the little lonely house on the  hill, occupied by the solitary spinster. The village post-office  establishment consisted principally of three important officials-- namely, Miss Nancy Skamp, post-master; Chizzle, first assistant post-master; and Pussy, the second assistant. The obligatory duty of the heads'of the department was to open the mails--the voluntarily assumed one was to open the letters also. The duty of the first assistant was to keep the fire burning and the water boling, and to hold the letters with the wafers to the steaming spout until they were soft enough to be opened without fracture. The office of the second assistant was a sinecure-her labors  being seldom extended beyond the clawing off the envelope of some newspaper during a fit of absent-minded purring. It is no wonder that Miss Nancy Skamp's temper was un-    usually tried upon this occasion. There, had been for several weeks past, an unusual dearth of piquant or mysterious letters, consequently a plentiful scqacity of scandalous news. The mails upon this day were also unusually late, the day was bit- terly. cold, and the waiters outside uncommonly impatient and' clamorous. The mail-bags were stuffed remarkably full, and. -? there were several wonderful letters, that she felt it her duty to : open and read before sending to, their owners. In addition to  all this-(everybody knows that petty vexations always come  ] in swarms)-the fire of green bass:wood would not burn-the ': kettle would not boil-the " little black willyan " vainly fanned - great clouds of smoke and ashes all over her headf into her  face, and down her throat; and the negroes outside grew every- '- moment more vociferous-stamping on the piazza to keep their  feet warm, rapping with the ends of riding whips on th-edoor. to hurry the post-mistress, and calling out to know if the mail  were not opened yet.                1 .

Her fit of abstraction was at last broken by a smart rap at the door. She started and turned pale, like the guilty creature that she was. The rap was repeated sharply.

And, as I was saying before, if you do like her, and mnst have her, why I shan't make no further objections." Here the young doctor, who had been gazing moodily into the fire, turned shortly around and stared at his aunt in unmea- sured astonishment! "Hem!" said Miss Nancy, looking confused, "well, yes, I did oppose it once, certainly, but that was because you were both poor." "And we are both poor still, for aught that I can see, and likely to continue so." "Hish-ish! no you're not! leastways, she's not. I've got something very strange to tell you," said Miss Nancy, myste- riously drawing her chair up close to her nephew, and putting her lips to his ear, and whispering--"Hish-ish!" "'Hish-ish!' What are you 'hish-ish'ing for, Aunt Nancy, I'm not saying anything, and your breath- spins into a fellow's ear enough to give him an ear-ache!" said Doctor Solomon, jerking his head away.

"There-now you're talking again! fish-ishA-sh!" With a spring and a groan, Doctor Solomon clapped one hand to his afflicted ear, and the other over his lips, with the desperate resolution to seal the one and save the other in per- fect silence.   is Now then listen-Marian Mayfield has got a fortune left to her." Miss Nancy paused to see the effect of this startling piece of news upon her companion. But the doctor was not sulky, and upon his guard; so after an involuntary slight start, he remained perfectly still. Miss Nancy was disappointed by the calm way in which he took this marvelous revelation. However, she went on to say: "Yes! a fortune left her, by a grand uncle, a bachelor, who died intestate, in Wiltshire, England. Now, what do you think of that I Why don't you speak? I declare I nevet saw such a log; can't you speak?" "You told me not to talk, just now. I declare it's very hard to please you!" "ish-ish i" "Ugh!" cried the doctor, starting and clapping his hand to his ear again. "I meant you must not talk loud enough for anybody to hear that might be listening. Now then speak low, and tell me what you think about Marian's having that fortune left her." "Why, I think if she wouldn't have me when she was poor, she wont be apt to do it now she's rich." "Ah I but you see, she don't know a word of it!" "How do you know it then?" "Hish-ish! I'll tell you if you will never tell.

In the meantime Marian's heart was weighed down by a new  : cause of sorrow and anxiety. Thrston never approached her now either in person, or by letter. She never saw him except at the church, the lecture room, or in mixed companies, where he kept himself aloof from her and devoted himself to the beautifu  and accomplished heiress Angelica Le Roy, to whom rumor gave him as an accepted suitor. So free was Marian's pure heart from jealousy or suspicion, that these attentions bestowed by Tharston, and these rumors circulated in the neighborhood, gave her no uneasiness. For though she had, for herself, discovered him to be passionate and impetuous, she believed him to be sound in principle. But when again and again she saw them together, at church, at lee- tdtre, at dinner parties, at evening dances; when at all the. Christmas and "New Year festivities, she saw her escorted by him; when she saw him ever at her side with a devotion as earnest and ardent as it was perfectly respectful; when she saw him bend and whisper to the witching girl and hang delighted on her " low replies," her own confidence was shaken. What could he mean? Was it possible, that instead of being merely, impulsive and erring, he was deliberately wicked? No, no, never  Yet, what could be his intentions? Did he really wish to win Angelica's heart? Alas' whether he wished so or not, it was but too evident to all that he had gained her pre- ference. In her blushing cheek and downcast eyes, and tremu- lous voice and embarrassed manner, when he was present- in her abstracted mind, and restless air and wandering glances when he was absent, the truth was but too clear. ' Marian was far too practical to speculate when she should act. It was clearly her duty to speak to Thurston on the sub^ jeet, and repugnant as the task was, she resolved= to perform it ' It was sometime before she had the opportunity. 28  &#xD;<pb n="446-447" xml:id="VAC7871-00000216"/> l ni  1 f. X fi iNt -BRlIDE. But at last, one afternoon in February, she chanced to meet Thurston on the sea beach. After greeting him, she candidly opened the subject. She spoke gently and delicately, but firmly and plainly, more so, perhaps, than another woman in the same position would have done, for Marian was eminently frank and fearless, especially where conscience was concerned. And Thurston met her arguments with a graceful noncha. lance, as seemingly polite and good humored, as it was really ironical and insulting. Marian gave him time-she was patient as firm-and firm as sorrowful. And not until every argument and persuasion had failed, she said-- "As a last resort, it may be necessary for me to warn Miss Le Roy-not for my own sake. Were. I alone involved, you know how much I would endure rather than grieve you. But this young lady must not suffer wrong." You will write her an anonymous letter, possibly?" "No-I never take an indirect road to an object." "What then can you do, fair saint?"  "See Miss Le Roy, personally." "Ha, ha, ha  What apology could you possibly make for such an unwarrantable interference?" "The Lord knoweth I I do not now. But I trust to be able to save her without revealing you." Do you imagine that vague warnings would have any effect upon her?" "Coming from me they would."

Marian was standing with her eyes fixed abstractedly upon a distant sail. Now the tears swelled under the large white eye- lids and hung glittering on the level lashes, and her lip quivered and her voice faltered slightly as she answered- "You see me through a false medium, dear Thurston, but the time will come when you will know me as I am." "I fancy the time has come. It has also come for me-to enlighten you a little. And in the first place, fair queen of minds, if not of hearts, let me assure you that there is a limit even to your almost universal influence. And that limit may be found in Miss Le Roy. You, who know the power of thought only, cannot weigh nor measure the power of love. Upon Miss Le Roy your warnings would have no effect what- ever.

And now I ask you how you could prevent it?" "I shall not be required to prevent such an act, Thurston, as such a one never can take place. You speak so only to try your Marian's faith or temper-both are proof against jests, I think. Hitherto you have trifled with the young lady's affec- tions from mere ennui and thoughtlessness, I do believe I but, now that some of the evil consequences have been suggested to your mind, you will abandon such perilous pastime. You are going to France soon-that will be a favorable opportunity of breaking off the acquaintance."  "And breaking her heart-who knows.

"And equally impossible, fair' saint, that you should divulge our marriage with any chance of proving it. Marian, the minister that married us has sailed as a'. missionary to Farther India.

Now that I have awakened your thoughts, I know that you will not further risk the peace of that confiding girl. Come I take my hand and let us return. We must hasten, too, for there is rain in that cloud." Thurston--piqued that he could not trouble her more-for under her calm and unruffled face he could not see the bleeding heart-arose sullenly, drew her hand within his arm and led her forth. And as they went the wind arose, and the storm clouds drove over the sky and lowered and darkened around them. Marian urged him to walk fast upon the account of the ap- proaching tempest, and the anxiety the family at the cottage would: feel upon her account. They hurried onward, but just as they reached the neighbor- hood of Old Fields a terrible storm of hail and snow burst upon the earth. It was as much as they could do to make any progress for ward, or, even to keep themselves upon their feet.

It was Miriam's voice I It was Miriam wandering in night and storm in search of her beloved nurse. Marian dropped Thurston's arm and plunged blindlyforward through the snow, in the direction of the voice, crying--"Here I am my darling, my treasure-here I am. What brought my baby out this bitter night?" she asked, as she found the child half perishing with cold and wet, and caught and strained her to her bosom. "Oh, the hail and snow came down so fast, and the wind shook the house so hard, and I could not sleep in the warm bed, while you were out in the storm. So I stole softly down to find you. Don't go again, Marian. I love you so--ohl I love you so!" At this moment the child caught sight of Thurston standing with his face half muffled in his cloak. A figure to be strangely recognized under similar circumstances in after years. Then she did not know him; but inquired- "Who is that, Marian?" "A friend, dear, who came home with me. Good night, sir." And so dismissing Thurston be walked rapidly away. She hurried with Miriam into the house. 31*  &#xD;<pb n="450-451" xml:id="VAC7871-00000218"/> CHAPTER XXXTII.

SANS' SOUci stood before the parlor mirror, gazing into it, seeing-not the reflected image of her own elfish figure, or ,pretty, witching face, with its round, polished forehead, its mocking eyes, its sunny, dancing curls, its piquant little nose, or petulant little lips--but contemplating, as through a magic glass, far down the vista of her childhood-childhood scarcely past, yet in its strong contrast to the present, seeming so distant, dim, and unreal, that her reminiscence of its days resem- bled more a  vague dream of a pre-existence, than a rational recollection of a part of her actual life on earth. Poor Jacko was wondering "' If I be I?" Grim' sat in a leathern chair, at the farthest extremity of the room, occupied with holding a-book and reading Jacquelina. Suddenly he broke into her brown study by exclaiming, "I should like to know what you are doing, and how   long you intend to remain standing before that glass." "Oh I indeed 1 should you?" mocked Jacko, startled out of her reverie, yet instantly remembering to be provoking. "' What were you doing, and-" "Looking at myself in the glass, to be sure."

Now none but a half mad man like Grim' would have gravely made such a demand, or exposed himself to such a rebuff as it deserved. Jacko looked at him quizzically. "Hem!  she answered, demurely. "I'm sure I'm so awe- stricken, your worship, that I can scarcely find the use of my tongue to obey your reverence. I hope your excellency Wont be offended with me.

"Anything else in my line ttiis morning, Doctor Grimshaw? Give me a call when you come my way I I shall be much obliged for your patronage," she continued, curtseying and dancing off towards the door. "By the way, my dear sir, there is a lecture to be delivered this evening, by our gifted young fellow-citizen, Mr. Thurston Willcoxen. Going to hear him? I am! Good-dayl"she said, and-kissed her hand and vanished. Grim' was going crazy I Everybody said it, and what every- body says, has ever been 'universally received as indisputable testimony. Many people, indeed, averred that Grim' never had, been quite right-that he always had been queer, and that since his mad marriage with that flighty bit of a child, Jacquelina, he had been queerer than ever. He would have been glad to prevent Jacquelina from going to the lecture upon the evening in question; but there was no! reasonable excuse for doing so. Everybody went to the lec- tures, which were very popular. Mrs. Waugh made a point of being punctually present at every one. And she took charge-- of Jacquelina, whenever the whim of the latter induced her to go, which 4was as often as she secretly wished to " annoy Grim'." And, in fact, "to plague the Ogre, was her only motive -in being present, for, truth to tell, the elf cared very little either for the lecturer or his subjects, and usually spent the whole even- ing in yawning behind her pocket handkerchief. Upon this evening, however, the lecture fixed even the flighty fancy- of Jacquelina, as she sat upon the front seat between Mrs, Waugkh and Doctor Grimshaw. The subject of the discourse was,;: "The Progress of Civilization." Thurston was in one of .his most inspired moods, .and his lecture was a glorious pano, rama of history--a succession of glowing pictures, each present- ing, in living form and color, some marked pagein the book of the world--some distinct stage in the progress of society."

He showed how the radical- ism of one age became the conservatism of the succeeding one; how the martyred of one century became the canonized of the next. He said that there were many good conservative Chris- tians in this age, who, had they lived in the days of Christ, would, from their temperament and disposition, have been very conservative Jews, and been among the first to cry "Crucify Him I  Crucify Him!" Jacquelina was magnetised, and scarcely took her eyes from the speaker during the whole discourse. Mrs. Waugh was also too much interested to notice her companions. Grim' was agonized.  The result of the whole of which was-that after they all got home, Doctor Grimshaw-to use a  common but graphic phrase-" put his foot down" upon the resolution to prevent Jacquelina's future attendance at the lectures. Whether he would have succeeded in keeping her away is very doubt- ful, had not a remarkably inclement season of weather set in, and lasted a fortnight, leaving the roads nearly impassable for two other weeks.  And just as traveling was getting to be pos- sible, Thurston Willcoxen was called to Baltimore, on his grandfather's business, and was absent a fortnight, So, alto- gether, six weeks had, passed without Jacquelina's finding an opportunity to defy Doctor Grimshaw, by attending the lectures against his consent. At the end of that time, on  Sunday morning, it was an- nounced in the church that Mr. Willcoxen having returned to the county, would resume his lectures on the Wednesday even a ing following. Doctor Grimshaw looked at Jacquelina, to note how she would receive this news. Poor Jacko had been under Marian's good influences for the week previous, and was, in her   ONE  OF  SANS-: SO UCI'S  TRICKS.   455 fitful and uncertain way, " trying to be good." , "As an expe- riment to please you, Marian,"- she said, " and to see how it will answer." Poor elf I So she called up no false, provoking smile of joy, to drive Grim' frantic, but heard the news of Thurston's arrival with the outward calmness that was perfectly true to the perfect inward indifference. "She has grown guarded--that is a very bad sign-I shall watch her the closer," muttered Grim' behind his closed teeth.' And when the Professor went home that day, his keen, pallid face was frightful to look upon. And many were the comments made by the dispersing congregation. "' I fell in long o' Doctor Grimsay, to-day at church, Miss Edif--and Mclare to Marster, he look so sharp and wild I was right 'fraid o' him," said Jenny, that day, as she put dinner on the table. -  "Did you see Professor Grimshaw? What can be the mat- ter with that man?" inquired Miss Thornton, of her brother. "An ill balanced mind," answered the Colonel, oracularly. "No man with a head shaped like his, can be perfectly sane." i : "Miss Jackeelar, honey, I doesn't want to give no 'ferice to , nobody, specially you; but you take my 'vice and don't 'vokel B: de 'fessor I Caze, child, I cotch my eye on him as he come in --an' ef ever I seed a man 'sessed o' Sam, 'tis he, now mine I tell you," said Old Oliver, putting his head into Jacquelina's sanctum, and whispering mysteriously. "My good soul, suppose you mond -your turkeys and geese, and leave family affairs of importance to the proper authorize ties,' replied Jacquelina, impatiently.  The crest-fallen old creature bowed humbly and withdrew, shutting the door carefully behind him." But scarcely had theb sound of his slow footsteps died away, when the door opened- again, and Mrs. Waugh entered. She sat down by Jacque- lina, and asked, "My dear child, did you 'notice the Professor? What. can ail him?           .

But on Wednesday morning, Dr. Grimshaw entered the parlor, where Jacquelina lingered alone, gazing out of the window, and going up to-her side, astonished- her beyond measure by speaking in a calm, kind tone, and saying, "Jacquelina, you have been too much confined to the house lately. You are languid. You must go out more. Mr, Will- coxen lectures this evening.: Perhaps you would like to hear him.

Would you like to go?" "I had already intended to go," replied Jacquelina, without relaxing a muscle of her face. The Professor nodded and left the room. Soon after, Jacquelina sought her aunty, whom she found in the pantry, mixing mince-meat. "I say, aunty--" "Well, Lapwing?" "When Satan turns saint, suspicion is safe, is it not?" ( What do you mean, Lapwing?" "Why, just now the Professor came to-me, politely apolo- gized for his late rudeness, and proposed that I should go with you to hear Mr. Willcoxen's lecture, white he, the Professor : goes to Leonardtown, to fulfill an engagement. I say, aunltl I sniff a plot, don't you?" "I don't know what to make of it, Lapwing. Are you : going?" "Of course I am; I always intended to." No more was saidgat the time. Immediately 4after dinner, Dr. xrimshaw ordered his horse, and saying that he was, going to Leonardtown and should not be back till the next day, set forth. And after an early tea, Mrs. Waugh and :Jacquelina set out in the family sleigh. A swift run over the hard, frozen snow, brought them to Old Fields, where they stopped a moment to pick up Marian, and then shooting forward at the same rate of speed, they reached the lecture-room in full time. It was quite crowded, but through the politeness of one of the professors, the three ladies were conducted up the length of the room, and seated upon the front bench that had been reserved for the clergy-some of the latter giving way 'to ' ^ ^  &#xD;<pb n="458-459" xml:id="VAC7871-00000222"/> 458     T H E M I SSI N  BRI DE. accommodate them. The young lecturer was just about to commence his discourse. I will not weary you by any report of it-but merely remark that as usual, he completely mag- netized the superior portion of his audience, and that at all the final passages of his oratory, his eyes were irresistibly fasci- nated to the bench where sat Mrs. Waugh, Marian, and Jac- quelina. As for the latter, she was perhaps the very least enchanted of all his hearers--she was in fact an exception, and found the discourse so entirely uninteresting that it was with difficulty she could refrain from yawning in the face of the orator. Mrs. Waugh also, perhaps, was but half mesmerized, for her eyes would cautiously wander from the lecturer's pulpit, to the side window on her right hand. At length she stooped and whispered to Jacquelina, "Child, be cautious; Dr. Grimshaw is on the ground-I have seen his face rise up to that lower pane of' glass at the corner of that window, several times. He must be crouched, down on the outside."  I fJacquelina gave a little start of surprise--her face underwent many phases of expression; she glanced furtively at the indi- l  uated window, and there she saw a pale, wild face gleam for an instant against the glass, and then drop. She nodded her head quickly-muttering, "Oh I'll pay him "  "Don't, childl don't do anything imprudent, for gracious sake I That man is crazy-any one can see he is!" "Oh, aunty, I'll be sure to pay him! He shan't- be in my debt much longer. Soft, aunty  Don't look towards the window again  Don't let him perceive that we see him or suspect him-and then, you'll see what you'll see. I have a counter plot." This last sentence was muttered to herself by Jacquelina, who thereupon straightened herself up--looked the lecturer in the eyes-and gave her undevoted attention to him during the rest of the evening. There was not a more appreciating and admiring hearer in the room, than Jacquelina affected to be.   ONE  OF SANS  SOUCI'S   TRICKS.   459 Her face was radiant, her eyes starry, her cheeks flushed, her pretty lips glowing breathlessly apart-her whole form instin ; with enthusiasm. Any"one might have thought the little crib ture bewitched. But the fascinating orator need not have flat. tered himself-had he but known it-Jacquelina neither saw his face nor heard his words; she was seeing pictures of Grim's bitter jealousy, mortification and rage, as he beheld her from his covert; she was rehearsing scenes of what she meant to do to him. And when at last she forgot herself, and clapped her hand enthusiastically, it was not at the glorious peroration-of the orator-but at the perfection of her own little plot!" When the lecturer had finished, and as usual announced the subject and the time of the next lecture, Jacquelina, instead of rising with the mass of the audience, showed a disposition to retain her seat. "Come, my dear, I am going," said Mrs. Waugh.. "Wait, aunty, I don't like to go in a crowd." Mrs. Waugh waited while the people pressed towards the  outer doors. "I wonder whether the Professor will wait and join us w we return home?" said Mrs. Waugh.  "We shall see," said Jacquelina. "I wish he may. I be- ( lieve he will. I am prepared for such an emergency." In the meantime, Thurston Willcoxen had descended from the platform, and was shaking hands right and left with the few people who had lingered to speak to him. Then he ap- proached Mrs. Waugh's party, bowed, and afterwards shook hands with each member of it, only, retaining Marian's- hand the fraction of a minute longest, and giving it an earnest pres- sure in relinquishing it. Then he inquired after the health of the family at Luckenough, commented upon the weather, the state of the crops, etc., and with a valedictory bow withdrew, and followed the retreating crowd. "I think we can also go now," said Mrs. Waugh. "Yes," said Jacquelina, rising. Upon reaching the outside, they found old Oliver, with the ,                  t   , ' s            ^    ,'   \f  &#xD;<pb n="460-461" xml:id="VAC7871-00000223"/> "O     THE  MSSING   BRIDE. sleigh, drawn up to receive them. Jacquelina looked all around, to see if she could discover Thurston Willcoxen on the grounds; and not seeing him anywhere, she persuaded herself that he must have hastened home. But she saw Dr. Grimshaw, recognised him, and at the same time could but notice the strong resemblance in form and manner that he bore to Thurs- ton Willcoxen, when it was too dark to notice the striking difference in complexion and expression. Doctor Grinshaw approached her, keeping his cloak partially lifted to his face, as if to defend it from the wind, but probably to conceal it. Then the evil spirit entered Jacquelina, and tempted her to sidle cautiously up to the Professor, slip her arm through his arm, and whisper, "Thurston! Comel Jump in the sleigh and go home with us. We shall have such a nice time Old Grim' has gone to Leonardtown, and wont be home till to-morrow!" "Has he, minion! By St. Judas! you are discoverd now  I have now full evidence of your turpitude. By all the saints I shall answer for it fearfully," said the Professor, between clenched teeth, as he closed his arm upon Jacquelina's arm, and dragged her towards the sleigh. "Ha I ha I ha! Oh I well, I don't care 1 If I mistook you for Thurston, it is not the first mistake I ever made about you I I mistook you once before for a man!" said Jacko, defiantly. He thrust her into the sleigh already occupied by Mrs. Waugh and Marian, jumped in after her, and took the seat by her side. "Why, I thought that you set out for Leonardtown this afternoon, Doctor Grimshaw!" said Mrs. Waugh, coldly. "You may have jumped to other conclusions equally false and dangerous, madam!" "What do you mean, sir?" "I mean, madam, that in conniving at the perfidy of this unprincipled girl, your niece, you imagined that you were safe. It was an error. You are both discovered!" said the Pro' fessor, doggedly.   ONE  OF  SANS   SOUCI'S   TRICKS.   461 Henrietta was almost Enraged. "Dr. Grimshaw," she1 said, "nothing but self-respect pre- vents me from ordering you from this sleigh!" "I. advise you to let self-respect,' or any other motive you please, still restrain you,; madam. I remain here as the warden of this pretty creature's erson, until she is safely secured." "You will at least be kind enough to explain to us the causes of your present words and actions, sir!" said Mrs. Waugh, severely. "Undoubtedly, madam! Having, as I judged, just reasons for doubting the integrity of your niece, and more than sus- pecting her attachment to Mr. Willcoxen, I was determined to test both. Therefore, instead of going to Leonardtown, to be absent till to-morrow, I came here, posted myself at a favor- able point for observation, and took notes. While here, I saw enough to convince me of Jacquelina's indiscretions. After. wards leaving the spQt with lacerated feelings, I drew near her.

WHEN the sulky sleighing party reached Luckenough, they found Commodore Waugh not only up and waiting, but in the highest state of self-satisfaction, a blessing of which they re- ceived their full share of benefit, for the old man, in the over- flowing of his joy, had ordered an oyster-supper, which was now all ready to be served smoking hot to the chilled and hungry sleigh-riders. "s I wonder what's out now?" said Jacquelina, as she threw -off her wrappings, scattering them heedlessly on the chairs and' floor of the hall. "Some awful calamity has overtaken some of Uncle Nick's enemies. Nothing on earth but that ever puts him into such a jolly humor. Now we'll see I I wonder if it is a 'crowner's 'quest' case?

During the supper Doctor Grimshaw sat up as stiff and solemnn-Jacquelina said--" as if he'd swallowed the poker and couldn't digest it." When they rose from the table, and were about leaving the dining-room, Dr. Grimshaw glided in a fune- real manner to the side of the Commodore, and demanded a private interview with him. "Not to-night, NaceI Not to-night! I know by- your looks what it is! It is some new deviltry of Jacquelina's. That can wait I I'm as sleepy as a whole cargo of opium I I would. '  not stop to talk now to Paul Jones, if he was to rise from the dead and visit me 1"  And the Professor had to be content with that, for almost im- mediately the family separated for the night. Marian, attended by the maid Maria, sought the chamber assigned to herself. When -she bad changed her tight-fitting day-dress for a wrapper, she dismissed the girl, locked the door behind her, and then drew her chair up before the little fire, and i fell into deep thought. Many causes of anxiety pressed heavily upon Marian.  That Thurston had repented his hasty marriage with herself she had every reason to believe.  She had confidently hoped that her explanation with Thurs-  ton would have resulted in good--but, alas I it seemed to have had little effect. OHis attentions-to Miss Le Roy were still un- remitted--the young lady's partiality was too evident to all--  and people already reported them to be engaged.

Would he persist in his present course? No, no, it could not be! This was probably done only to pique herself; but then it was carried too far; it was ruining the peace of a good, confiding girl. And Jacquelina--she had evidently mistaken Dr. Grimshaw for Thurston, and addressed to him words arguing a familiarity very improper, to say the least of it.. Could he be trifling with poor Jacquelina too? Jacko's words when be- lieving herself addressing Thurston, certainly denoted some such "foregone conclusion." Marian resolved to see Thurston once more-once more to expostulate with him, if happily it might have some good effect. And having formed this reso- lution, she knelt and offered up her evening prayers, and retired to bed. The next day being Holy Thursday, there was, by order of the trustees, a holiday at Miss Mayfield's school. And so :Marian arose with the prospect of spending the day with Jacquelina. Wfien she descended to the breakfast-room, what was her surprise to find Thurston Willcoxen, at that early hour, the sole occupant"tf the room. He wore a green shoot- ing jacket, belted around his waist. He stood upon the hearth, with his back to the fire, his gun leaned against the corner of t he mantle-piece, and his game-bag dropped at his feet. 1Marian's neart bounded, and her cheek and eye kindled when she. saw him, and, for the instant, all her doubts vanished-she could not believe- that guilt lurked behind a countenance so frank, noble and calm as his. He stepped forward to meet her, extending his hand, She placed her own in it, saying, "I am very glad- to see you this morning, dear Thurston, for I have something to say to you which I hope you will take kindly from your Marian, who has no dearer interest in the world than your welfare." "Marian, if it is anything relating to our old subject of dis-, pnte-Miss Le Roy--let me warn you that I will hear nothing about it." "Thurston, the subjects of a neighborhood's gossip are always      .-   SANS  SOUCI' S  LAST  FUN.    465 the very last to hear it' You do not, perhaps, know that it is commonly reported that you and Miss Le Roy are engaged to be married!"

But, upon calm reflection, I fully believe that you could never give that young lady my place in your heart, that having known and loved me-" Marian paused, but the soul rose like a day-star behind her beautiful face, lighting serenely under her white eyelids, glow- ing softly on the parted lips and blooming cheeks. "Aye.

It is two weeks, Thurston, since I first urged'this upon you; I have hesitated already too long, and now I tell you, though my heart bleeds to say it, that unless you promise to see Angelica no more, Iwill see and have an explanation with her to-morrow!" ' You will 1" "You can prevent it, dearest Thurston, by yourself doing what you know to be right." "And if I do not?" "I will see Miss Le Roy, tormorrow!" "By Heaven, then-" His words were suddenly cut short by the entrance of Mrs. Waugh. In an instant his countenance changed, and taking up his bag of game, he went to meet the smiling good humored woman, saying with a gay laugh, "Good-morning, Mrs. Waugh! You see I have been shoot- ing in the woods of Luckenough, this morning, and I could not leave the premises without offering this tribute to their honored mistress." And Thurston gaily laid the trophy at her feet. "Hebe I wili you please to see that a cup of hot coffee is sent up to Mrs. L'Oiseau; she is unwell this morning, as I knew she would be, from her excitement last night; or go with it your- self, Hebe The presence of the goddess of health at her bed- side is surely needed." Marian left the room, and then Mrs. Waugh, turning to the young gentleman, said, ' Thurston, I am glad to have this opportunity of speaking to you, for I have something very particular to say, which you must hear without taking offence at your old aunty!"  "Humphl I am in for petticoat discipline this' morning, beyond a doubt," thought the young man; but he only bowed, and placed a chair for Mrs. Waugh. "I shall spfeak very plainly, Thurston."   SANS  SOUCI'S   LAST  FUN.     467 Oh I by all means I As plainly as you please, Mrs. Waugh," said Thurston, with an-odd grimace; "I am growing accustomed - to have ladies speak very plainly to me." "Welll it wont do you -any harm, Thurston. And now to the pointl I told you before, that you must not show any civility to Jacquelina. And now i repeat it I And I warn you, that if you do, you will cause some frightful misfortune that you will have to repent all the days of your life-if it be, not fatal first of all to yourself.

Come! I'm getting up quite the reputation of a lady-killer!" thought the young man. Then with a light laugh, he looked up to Mrs. Waugh, ' and said,  v                       I "My dear madam, do you take me for a man who would, willingly disturb the peace or honor of a family?"    - "Pshaw I By no means, my dear Thurston.

"Sir, you mistake, she made love to me." "You impudent, impertinent, unprincipled jackanape."

"Miss Le Roy will be likely to form a high, opinion of me before the week is out," said Thurston, laughing. "You--you-you graceless villain, you," cried the Commo- dore in a rage-" to think that I had such confidence in 'you, sir defended you upon all occasions, sir; refused to believe in your villany, sir; refused to close my doors against you, sir.

Thurston's face was now the picture of astonishment and perplexity. The Commodore seemed to mistake it for a look of consternation and detected guilt, for be continued : 1 "And now, sir, I suppose you understand what is to follow. Do you see that door? It leads straight into the hall, which eads directly through the front portal out into the lawn, and in to -the highway-that is your road, sir. Good morning." And the Commodore thumped down his stick and left the room athe image --of righteous indignation.   SANS  SOUC-I'S  LAST  FUN.    469 Thurston nodded-smiled slightly, drew his tablets from his pocket, tore a leaf out, took his pencil, laid the paper upon the corner of the mantle-piece, wrote a few lines, folded the note, and concealed it in his hand as the door opened, and admitted Mrs. Waugh, Marian and Jacquelina. There was a telegraphic glance between the elder lady and -the young man. That of Mrs. Waugh' said:- " Do have pity on the fools, and go, Thurston." That of Thurston, said:- "I am going, Mrs. Waugh, and without- laughing, if I can help it." Then he picked up his shooting cap, bowed to Jacquelina, shook hands with Mrs. Waugh, and pressing Marian's palm, left within it the note that he had written, took up his game bag and 'gun, and departed. "The inconceivable idiots I" said Thurston, as he strode on through the park ofLuckenough, "to faney that any one with eyes, heart and brain, could possibly fall in love with the 'Will-o'-the-wisp' Jacquelina, or worse, that giglet, Angelica; when he sees Marian ! Marian, whose least sunny tress is dearer to me, than are all the living creatures in the world besides. Marian, for whose possession I am now about to risk every- thing, even her own esteem. Yet, she will forgive me; I will earn her forgiveness by such devoted love." He hurried on until he reached an outer gate, through which old Oliver was driving a.cart loaded with wood. As if to dis- encumber himself, he threw his game bag and valuable fowlivg piece to the old man, saying:- "There, uncle; there's a present for you," and withoit waiting to hear his thanks, hurried on, leaping hedges and ditches, until he came to the spot where he had left his 'horse tied since the morning. Throwing himself into his saddle, he put spurs to his horse, and galloped away towards the villag, nor drew rein until he reached X little tavern on:the water sid. He threw his bridle to an' hostler in waiting, and hurrying i, &#xD;<pb n="470-471" xml:id="VAC7871-00000228"/> 470     THE   MS"SING  BRIDE. demanded to be shown into a private room. The little parlor was placed at his disposal. Here, for form's sake, he called for the newspaper, cigars, and a bottle of wine, (none of which'he discussed however,) dismissed the attendant, and sat waiting. "Presently the avant-courier of mingled fumes of tar, bilge water, tobacco and rum, warned him that his expected visitor was approacning. And an instant after the door was opened, and a short, stout, dark man in a weather-proof jacket, duck trowsers, cow-hide shoes, and tarpaulin hat entered. "Well, Miles, I've been waiting for you here more than an hour," said Thurston, impatiently. "Aye, aye, sir-all right. I've been cruising round, recon- noitering the enemy's coast," replied the man, removing the quid of tobacco from his mouth, and reluctantly casting it into the fire. "You are sure you know the spot?" "Aye, aye, sir-the beach just below Old Fields farmhouse." "And south of the Pine Bluff." "Aye, aye, sir I I know the port-that aint the head wind 1"  said Jack Miles, pushing up the side of his hat, and scratching his head with a look of doubt and hesitation.

The family were assembled arounidthe table. Doctor, Grim.. shawls dark, sombre, and lowering looks, enough to have spread a gloom over any circle, effectually banished cheerfulness from the board. Marian had had no opportunity of reading her  note-she had slipped it into her pocket. But as soon:as breakfast was over, amid the bustle of rising from the table,/Ma-? rian withdrew to a window and glanced over the lines. "My own dearest one, forgive my haste this morning.

She hastily crumpled the note, and thrust it into her pocket just as Jacquelina's quizzical face looked over her shoulder. "You're going to stay all day with me, Marian?" "Yes, love-that is, till after dinner. Then I shall have to beg of Mrs. Waugh the use of the carriage to-go home." "Well, then, fIwill ride with you, Marian, and return in the carriage." All the company, with the exception of Mrs. Waugh, Marian, and Jacquelina, had left the breakfast-room. Mrs. Waugh was locking her china closet, and when  she had done, she took her bunch of keys, and turning to Marian, said, "I ebe, dear, I want you to go with me and see poor old Cracked Nell. She is staying in one of our quarters. I think she has not long to live, and I want you to talk to her." "Now?" "Yes, dear, I am going to carry her some. breakfast. So, comel along, and get your mantle," said the good woman, pass- bing out through the door. Marian followed, drawing,out her pocket handkerchief to tie over her head; and as she did so, the note, unperceived by her, fluttered out, and fell upon the carpet. Jacquelina impulsively darted upon it, picked it up, opened, and read it. Had Jacquelina first paused to reflect, she would never have done so. But when did the elf ever stop to think? As she read, her eyes began to twinkle, and her feet to patter up and down, and her head to sway from side-to side, as if she could scarcely keep from singing and dancing for glee. "Well, now, who'd a thought it I Thurston making love to Marian I  'And keeping the coirtship close, too, for fear of the old miser. Lordl but look here I  This was-not right of me?

Eureka 1!" soli- loquised the dancing elf, as she placed her handkerchief in the bottom of her pocket, and the note on top of it, and passed on to the drawing-room to ",bide her time." That soon came. She found the Professor and the- Commo- dore standing il the 'middle of the room, in an earnest conver-  sation, which, however, seemed near its close, for as she took her seat, the Commodore said, "Very well- I'll attend to it, Nace," and clapped his hat upon his head, and went out, while the Professor dropped him- self into a chair, and took up a book.  ' "Oh, stop, I want to speak to you a-minute, uncle," cried Jacquelina, starting up and flying after him, and as she flew,  pulling out her handkerchief and letting the note drop upon  the floor. A swift, sly, backward glance showed her that   Grim' had-pounced upon it like a panther on its prey. '-'What in the d--l's name are you running after me for?I  burst forth the old man as Jacko overtook 'him.      i "Why, uncle, I want to knowJf you'll please to give order $ in the stable to have the carriage wheels washed off nicely? ; They neglect it.

Jacquelina laughed, and, quivering through every fibre of her frame with mischief, went back into the drawing-room to see the ,state of Grim'. -  To Jacquelinas -surprise she found the note lying upon the same spot. where she had dropped it. Doctor Grimshaw was ' standing with his back towards her, looking out of the window.  She could not see the expression of his- countenance.

Jacquelina could scarcely suppress a scream-it was as if a ghost had come before her, so blanched was his color, so ghastly his features. An instant he gazed in her eyes, and then passed out and went up stairs. Jacquelina turned slowly around, looking after him like one magnetized. Then recovering herself, with a deep breath she said, "Now I ask of all the ' powers that be' generally, what's the meaning of that? He picked up the note and he read it, that's certain I and he dropped it there again to make me believe he had never seen it, that's certain, too! I wonder what he means to do  There'll be fun of some sort, anywayl StopI here comes Marian from the quarters! I shouldn't wonder if'she has missed her note, and hurried back in search of it I Come I I'll take a hint from Grim', and drop it where I found it, and say nothing " And so soliloquizing, the fairy glided back into the breakfast- room, let the note fall, and turned away just in time to allow Marian to enter, glance around, and pick up herlost treasure. Then joining Marian, she invited her up stairs to look at some new finery just come from the city. The forenoon passed heavily at Luckenough.  When the dinner hour approached, and the family collected in the dining- room, Doctor Grimshaw was missing; and when a  messenger was sent to call him to dinner, an answer was returned that the Professor was unwell, and preferred to keep his room. Jacquelina was quivering between fun and fear--vague, un- accountable fear, that hung over her like a cloud, darkening her bright frolic spirit with a woful presentiment. After dinner Marian asked for the carriage,' and  SiMrs. Waugh gave orders that it should be brought round for her use. Jacquelina prepared to accompany Miarian home, and in an hour they were ready, and set forth. '  i "You may tell Grim', if he asks after me, that I am 'gone   SANS  SOUC-I'S  LAST    FUN.   475 home with Marian to Old Fields, and that I am not certain whether I shall return to-night or not," said Jacquelina, as she took leave of Mrs. Waugh.  "My dear Lapwing, if you love your old aunty, come im- mediately back in the carriage. And, by-the-way, my dear, I wish that you would, either in going or coming, take the post- office, and get the letters and papersi" said Mrs. Waugh.: "Let it be in going then, Mrs. Waugh, for I have not been to the post-office for two days, and there maybe something there for us also," said Marian. "Very well, bright Hebe I as you please, of course," replied good Henrietta. And so they parted. Did either dream how many sunsg would rise and set--how many seasons come and go-how many years roll by, before they two should meet again? The carriage was driven rapidly on to the village, and drawn up at the post-office. Old Oliver jumped down, and went in to make the necessary inquiries. They waited impatiently until' he reappeared, bringing one large letter. There was nothing for Luckenough.  The great double letter was for Marian. She took it, and as the carriage was started again, and drawn towards Old Fields, she examined the post-mark and superscription. It was a ,for-  eign letter, mailed from London, and-superscribed in-the hand- writing of her oldest living friend, -the pastor who had attended her brother in his prison and at the scene of his death. Marian with tearful eyes and eager hands, broke the seal and  read, while Jacquelina watched her. For more than half an hour Jacko watched her, and then impatience- overcame discre- X tion in the bosom of the fairy, and she suddenly exclaimEnd, - "Well, Marian I I do wonder what can ail you? You grdg  pale, and then you grow red, -our bosom heaves, the tears come / I / in your eyes, yoU clasp your hands tightly together as in prayer : ,-then you smile and raise your eyes as in thanksgiving 1 Now ' I do wonder what it all means?"    -         ;  "It means, dear Jacquelina, that I am the most grateful :  &#xD;<pb n="476-477" xml:id="VAC7871-00000231"/> THE HMS SING     RIDE. creature upon the face of the earth, just now; and to-morrow, I will tell you why I am so 1" said Marian, with a rosy smile. And well she might be most grateful and most happy, for that letter bad brought her assurance of fortune beyond her greatest desires.- On reading the news, her very first thought had been of Thurston. Now the great objection of the miser to their marriage would be removed--the great obstacle to their imme- diate union overcome. Thurston would be delivered from tempta- tion; she would be saved anxiety and suspense. "Yes I I will meet him this evening-I cannot keep this blessed news from him a day longer than necessary; for this fortune that has come to me, will all be his own 1 ^Oh I! how rejoiced I am, to be the means of enriching him; how much good we can both do?" These were the tumultuous, generous thoughts that sent the flush to Marian's cheeks, the smiles to her lips, and the tears to her eyes-that caused those white fingers to clasp, and those clear eyes to rise to Heaven in thankfulness, as she folded up her treasured letter and placed it in her bosom. An hour's ride brought them to Old Field Cottage. The sun had not yet set ; but the sky was dark with clouds that threatened rain or snow-and therefore Jacquelina only took time to jump out and speak to Edith, shake hands with old Jenny, kiss Miriam, and bid adieu to Marian-and then saying that she believed she- would hurry back on her aunty's account, and that she was afraid she would not get to Luckenough before ten o'clock, anyhow, she jumped into the carriage and drove off. And Marian, guarding her happy secret, entered the cot- tage to make preparations for keeping her appointment with Thurston. Meanwhile, at Luckenough, Doctor Grimshaw kept his room tastil late in the afternoon. Then, descending the stairs, and meeting-the maid Maria, who -almost shrieked aloud at tho ghastly face that confronted her-he asked, "Where is Mrs. Grimshaw?"    NIG'HT  A-ND  STORM.       477T "Lord, sir!" cried the girl, half paralyzed by the sound, of his sepulchral voice-" she's done gone home 'long o' Miss: Marian." "When will she be back--do you know?" "Lord, sir!" cried Maria, shuddering, "I heerd her tell old Mis', how she didn't think she'd be back to-night." "Ah!" said the unhappy man, in a hollow tone, that seemed to sound from a tomb, as he passed down.  And Maria, glad to escape him, fled up stairs, and never paused until she had found refuge in Mrs. L'Oiseau's room. One hour after that, Professor Grimshaw, closely enveloped in an ample cloak, left Luckenough, and took'the road to the beach. CIAPTER XXXV: NIGHT  AND  STORM.

Afar off, a sail, dimly seen or guessed at, glided ghost. like through the shadows. Landward, the boundaries of field and forest, hill and vale, were all blended, fused, in murky ob. scurity. Heavenward, the lowering sky was darkened by wild, scudding, black' clouds, driven by the wind, through which the young moon seemed plunging and hiding as in terror. The tide'was coming in, and the waves surged heavily with a deep nloan upon the beach. Not a sound was heard, except the dull, monotonous moan of the sea, and the fitful, hollow wail of the wind. The character of the scene was in the last degree wild, dreary, gloomy and fearful. Not so, however, it seemed to Marian, who, filled with happy, generous, and tumultuous thoughts, was scarcely conscious of the gathering darkness, and the lowering storm, as she walked up and down upon the beach, listening and waiting. She wondered that Thurston had'not been there ready to receive her; but this thought gave her little uneasiness-it was nearly lost-as the storm and darkness also were-in the brightness and gladness of her own loving, generous emotions. There was no room in her heart for doubt or trouble. If the thought of the morning's conversation and of Angelica entered her mind, it was only to be soon dismissed with fair construction and cheerful hope. And then she pic- tured to herself the surprise, the pleasure of Thurston, when he should hear of the accession of fortune which should set them both free to pursue their inclinations and plans for their own happiness and for the benefit of others." And she sought in her bosom if the letters were safe. Yes I there they were; shefelt them; her happiness had seemed a dream without that proof of its reality. For once she gave way to imagination, and allowed that' magician to build castles in the air at will. Thurston and herself must go -to England imnmediately to take possession of the estate-that was certain. Then they must return.  But ere that, she would confide to him her darling project; one that she had never breathed to any, because to have done so would have been vain; one that she had longingly dreamed of, but never, as now, hoped to realize. And Edith I   I GHT  AN D   ST O R M.     479 she would make Edith so comfortable I Edith should be again surrounded with the elegancies and refinements of life. - And Miriam I Miriam should have every advantage of education that wealth could possibly secure for her, either in this country or in Europe. If Edith would spare Miriam, the little girl should go with her to England. But Thurston I above all, Thurston! A heavy drop of rain struck Marian in the face, and, for an instant, woke her from her blissful reverie. She looked up. Why did not Thurston come? The storm would soon burst forth upon the earth-where was Thurston? Were he by her side there would be nothing formidable in the storm, for he would shelter her with his cloak and umbrella, as they should scud along over the fields to the cottage, and reach the fireside-before the rain could overtake them. Where was he? what could detain him at such a time? She peered through the darkness up and down the beach. To her accustomed eye, the features of the landscape were dimly visible. That black -form looming like a shadowy giant before lier, was the headland of Pine Bluff, with its base washed by the sullen waves. It was the only object that broke the dark, dull monotony of the shore. - She listened--the moan of the sea, the wail of the wind; were blended in mournful chorus. It was the only sound that broke the dreary silence of the hour.       -  Hark I No, there was another sound! Amid the moaning and the wailing of winds and waves, and the groaning of the coming storm, was heard the regular. fall of oars, soon followed by the slow, grating sound of a boat pushedl up upon the frozen strand. Marian paused and strained her eyes through the   darkness in the direction of the soundi but could see nothing save the deeper,- denser darkness around Pine Bluff.. -She  turned, and, under cover of the darkness, moved swiftly ald  silently from the locality. The storm was coming on very fast. Tlhe rain was falling and the wind rising and driving it into her :ace. She pulled her hood closely about her face, and wrapped ler shawl tightly about her as she met the blast.' .   . Oh I where was Thurston, and why did he not come?

No, for she had confidently trusted in his keep. ing his-appointment. She had never known him to fail before. What could have caused the failure now? Had he kept his tryste they would now have been safely housed at Old Field Cottage. Perhaps 'Thurston, seeing the clouds, had taken for grauted that she would not come, and he had therefore stayed away. Yet no-she could not for an instant entertain that thought. "Well she knew that had a storm risen, and raged as never a storm did before, Thurston, upon the bare possibility of her presence there, would keep his appointment. No! something beyond his control had delayed him. And, unless i"  he should now very soon appear, something very serious had happened to him. The storm was increasing in violence; her shawl was already wet; and she resolved to hurry home. She had just turned to go, when the sound of a man's heavy measured footsteps, approaching from the opposite direction, fell upon her ear. She' looked up half in dread, and strained her eyes out into the blackness of the night. It was too dark to see anything but the outline of a man's figure wrapped in a large cloak, coming slowly on towards her; as the man drew near, she recognized the well-known figure, air and gait-she had no doubt of the identity. She hastened to meet him, ex- claiming in a low, eager tone, "Thurston! dear Thurston." The man paused, folded his cloak about him, drew up and stood perfectly still. Why did he not answer her? why did he not speak to her? why did he stand so motionless, and look so strange? She could not have seen the expression of his countenance, even if a flap of his cloak had not been folded across his face, but his whole form shook as with an ague fit. "Thurston, dear Thurston," she exclaimed once more, under her breath, as she pressed towards him. But he suddenly stretched out his hand to repulse her-gasp- ing, asit were, breathlessly, "Not yet-not yet;" and again his   NIGHT   AND  STORM.       481 whole frame shook with an inward storm. What could be the reason of his strange behaviour? Oh! some misfortune had happened to him-that was evident. Would it were only of a nature that her own good news might be able to cure. And it, might be so.. Full of this thought, she was again pressing to- wards him, when a violent flurry of rain and wind whistled before her and drove into her face, concealing him from her view. When the sudden gust as suddenly passed, she saw that he remained in the same spot, his breast heaving, his whole form shaking. She could bear it no longer. She started for. ward and put her arms around his neck, and dropped her head upon his bosom, and whispered in suppressed tones, "Dearest Thurston, what it the matter? Tell me, for I love you more than life." The man clasped his left arm fiercely around her waist--lifted his right hand, and hissing sharply through his clenched teeth. "You have drawn on your own doom-die, wretched girl ;" plunged a dagger in her bosom, and pushed her from him. One sudden, piercing shriek, and she dropped at his feet, grasping at the ground, and writhing in agony. Her soul seemed striving to recover the shock, and recollect its facul- ties. She half arose upon her elbow, supported her head upon her hand, and with her other hand drew the steel out from her bosom, and-laid it down. The blood followed, and with the life-stream her strength flowed away. The hand that supported her head suddenly dropped, and she fell back. The man had been standing over her, speechless, motionless, breathless, like some wretched somnambulist, suddenly awakened in the- comr mission of a crime, and gazing in horror, amazement, and un' belief upon the work of his sleep. Suddenly he dropped upon his knees by her side, put his arm under her head and shoulders and raised her up; but her chin fell forward upon her bosom, and her eyes fixed and glazedi He laid her down gently, groaning in a tone of unspeakable anguish, '                      J  "Miss Mayfield I my God I what have I done,?" -And with   &#xD;<pb n="482-483" xml:id="VAC7871-00000234"/> 482     THE   MSSING   BRIDE. an awful cry between a shriek and a groan, the wretched man cast himself upon the ground by the side of the fallen body. The storm was beating wildly upon the assassin and his vic- tim, but the one felt it no more than the other. At length the sound of footsteps was heard approaching fast and near. In the very anguish of remorse the instinct of self-preservation seized the wretched man, and he started up and fled as from the face of the avenger of blood. In the meantime Jacquelina had reached home sooner than she had expected. It was just dark, and the rain was begin- ning to fall as she sprang from the carriage and darted into the ' 'house. , ' Mrs. Waugh met her in the hall, took her hand and said, "Oh, my dear Lapwing, I'm so glad you. have come back, bad as the weather is, for indeed the Professor gives me a great deal of anxiety, and if you had stayed away to-night I could not have been answerable for the consequences. There, now, hurry up stairs and change your dress, and come down to tea. It is all ready, and we have a pair of canvass-back ducks roasted." "Very well,- aunty! But-is Grim' in the house?" '(I don't know, my love. You hurry." Jacquelina tripped up the stairs to her own room, which she found lighted, warmed, and attended by her maid, Maria. She took off her bonnet and mantle, and laid them aside, and began to smooth her hair, dancing all the time, and quivering with suppressed laughter, in anticipation of her "fun." When she had arranged her dress, she went down stairs and passed into the dining-room, where the supper table was -set. "See if Nace Grimshaw is in his room, and if he is not, we will wait no longer 1" said the hungry Commodore, thumping his heavy stick down upon the floor. Festus sprang to do his bidding, and after an absence of a few minutes returned with the information that the Professor was not there.   NIGHT   AND    STOR M.      483 Jacquelina shrugged her shoulders, and shook with inward laughter. They all sat down, and amid the Commodore's growls at Grim's irregular hours, and Jacquelina's shrugs and smiles and sidelong glances and ill-repressed laughter, the meal passed. And when it was over, the Commodore, leaning on Mrs. Waugh's arm, went to his own particular sofa in the back parlor; Mrs. L'Oiseau remained, to superintend the clearing away of the supper-table; and Jacquelina danced on to the front parlor, where she found no one but the maid, who was mending the fire. "Say I did you see anything of the Professor while I was gone?" sh6 inquired. "Lors, honey, I wish I hadn't I I knows how de thought of it will give me 'liriums nex' time I has a- fever." "Why? what did he do? when was it?" "Why, chile, jes afore sundown, as I was a carryin' an -arm- ful of wood up stairs, for Miss Mary's room, I meets de 'fessor a -comin' down.

Her dance was brought to a sudden and an awful close. The hall door was thrown violently open, hurried and irregulax steps were heard approaching, the parlor door was pushed open, and Doctor Grimshaw staggered forward and paused before her! Yes I her frolic was brought to an eternal end. She saw at a glance that something fatal, irreparable, had happened. There was blood upon his hands and wristhands.

With a last great effort to articulate, the blood suddenly filled his throat and gushed from his mouth! For a moment he sought to stay the hemorrhage by pressing a handkerchief to his lips, but soon his hand dropped powerless to his side, he reeled and fell upon the floor I Jacquelina gazed in horror on her work.:   And then her screams of terror filled the house I The family came rushing in. Foremost entered the Commo. dore, shaking his stick in a towering passion, and exclaiming, at the top of his voice, "What the d--1 is all this? What's broke loose now? What are you raising all this row for, you infernal little Hurri- cane?' "Oh, uncle aunty mother look I look!" exclaimed Jacque- lina, wringing her pale fingers, and pointing to the fallen man. The sight arrested all eyes, The miserable man lay over on his side, ghastly pale, and breathing laboriously, every breath pumping out the life blood that had made a little pool beside his face. Mrs. Waugh and Mary L'Oiseau hastened to stoop and raise the sufferer. The Commodore drew near, half stupefied, as he always was in a crisis. "What-what-what's all this? Who did it? how did it happen?" he asked, with a look of dull amazement. Give me a sofa cushion, Maria, to place under his head.

"Stay! the doctor has been sent for; but he must not be moved, it would be fatal to him; indeed, I fear that he is beyond human help," said Henrietta, as she wiped the gushing stream from the lips of the dying man. "Beyond human help I eh? what? Nace I no, no, no, no, it can't be!" said the old man, kneeling down, and bending over him in helpless trouble. "Attend Doctor Grimshaw, while I hurry out and see what can be done, Mary," said Mrs. Waugh, resigning her charge, and then hastening from the room. She soon returned, bring- ing with her such remedies as her limited knowledge suggested. And she and Mary L'Oiseau applied them; but in vain I every effort for his relief seemed but to hasten his death. The hemorrhage was Subsiding, so also was his breath. "It is too late, he is dying,:' said Henrietta, solemnly. "DyingI no, no, N'ce I Nacel speak to me, Nace I you're not dying I I've lost more blood than that in my time 1! Nace I Nacel speak to your old-speak, Nace " cried the Commo- dore, stooping down and raising the sufferer in his arms, and gazing, half-wildly, half-stupidly, at the congealing face. 'iHe continued thus for some moments, until Mrs. Waugh, putting her hand upon his shoulder, said gravely and kindly, "Lay him down, Commodore Waugh--he is gone." 'Gone Gone!" echoed the old man, in his imbecile distrac- tion, and dropped his gray head upon the corpse, and groaned aloud.  , Mrs.- Waugh came and laid her hand affectionately on his shoulder. He looked up in such hopeless, helpless trouble, and cried out, "Oh, Henrietta, he was my son, my only, only son I my poor! unowned boy! Oh, Henrietta, is he dead? are you sure? is he quite gone?"

IN the meanwhile, where was he whose headlong passions had precipitated this catastrophe? where was Thurston? After- having parted with his confederate, he hurried home; for a very!" busy day lay before him. To account for his sudden departure, and long absence, and to cover his retreat, it was necessary to have some excuse, such as a peremptory summons to Baltimore upon the most important business. Once in that city, he would have leisure to find some further apology for proceeding dim. rectly to France without first returning home.

He hastened to Dell-Delight, and showing the old man a letter he had that morning received from the city, informed him that he was obliged to depart immediately, upon affairs of the most urgent moment to him, and then, to escape the sharp stings of self-scorn, he busied himself with arranging his papers, packing his trunks and ordering his servants. His baggage Was packed into and behind the old family carriage, and having completed his preparations about one o'clock, he entered it, and was driven rapidly to the village. The schooner was already at the wharf and waiting for him.  Thurston met many of his friends in the village, and in an off- hand manner explained to them the ostensible cause of his jour- ney. And thus, in open daylight, gayly chatting, with his friends, Thurston superintended the embarkation of his bag- gage. And it was not until after one by one they had shaken hands with him, wished him a good voyage and departed, that Thurston found himself alone with the captain inthe cabin. "Now you know, Miles, that I have not come on board to remain. When the coast is clear I shall go on shore, get in the carriage, and return to Dell-Delight. I must meet my wife on the beach. I must remain with her through all. I'must take her on board. You will be off Pine Bluff just at dusk, captain?" "Aye, aye, sir." "You will not be a moment behind-hand?" "Trust me for that, Cap'n." (' See if the people have left." "The skipper went on deck and returned, to report the coast clear.  Thurston then went on shore, entered the carriage, and was driven homeward. It was nearly four o'clock when he reached Dell-Delight, and there he found the whole premises in a state of confusion. Several negroes were on the lookout for him; and as soon as they saw him ran to the house.

"A fit! good heavens I has a doctor been summoned?" exclaimed Thurston, springing from his seat. "Oh, yes, sir! Jase be done gone arter de doctor." Thurston stopped to inquire no farther, but ran into the house and up into his grandfather's chamber.  There a distressing scene met his eyes. The old man, with his limbs distorted, and his face swollen and discolored, lay in  a state of insensibility upon the bed. Two or three negro women were gathered around him, variously occupied with rub, :- bing his hands, chafing his temples, and wiping the oozing foam  from his lips. At the foot of the bed stood poor daft Fanny, with disheveled hair and dilated eyes, chanting a grotesque monologue, and keeping time with a see-saw motion from side to side. The first thing Thurston did, was to take the hand 'of this poor crazed, but docile creattre, and lead her from the sick room up into her own. He bade ieer remain there, and then -a returned to his grandfather's bedside. In reply to his anxious  questioning, he was informed that the old man had falle n into - a fit about an hour before-that a boy had been instantly sent for the doctor, and the patient carried to bed; but: that he :nhd  not spoken since they laid him there. It would yet be an:hour before the doctor could possibly arrive, and the state of the  patient demanded instant attention. '  And withal Thurston was growing very anxious upon lMarian'  account.

Hle felt, of course, that his scheme must for the present be deferred-even if its accomplishment should again seem necessary, which was scarcely possible. But Marian would expect him. - And how should he prevent her from coming to the beach and waiting for him there? He did not know where a message would be most likely nozw to find her, whether at+ Luckenough, at Old Fields, or at Colonel Thorntos's. But he momentarily expected the arrival of Doctor Brightwell, and he resolved to leave-that good man in attendance at the sick bed, while he himself should escape for a few hours, and hurry to the beach to meet and have an explanation with his wife. But an hour passed, and the doctor did not come. Thurs- ton's eyes wandered anxiously from the distorted face of the dying man before him, to the window that commanded the approach to the house. But no sign of the doctor was to be seen. The sun was on the very edge of the horizon. The sufferer before him was evidently approaching his end. Marian he knew must be on her way to the beach. And a dreadful storm was rising. His anxiety reached fever heat. He could not leave the bedside of his dying relative, yet Marian must not be permitted to wait upon the beach, exposed to the fierceness of the storm, or worse, the rudeness of his own confederates. He took a sudden resolution, and wondered that he had not done so before. He resolved to summon Marian as his wife to his home. Full of this thought, he hastened down stairs and ordered Melchizedek to put the horse to the gig and get ready to go an errand. And while the boy was obeying his directions, Thurs- ton penned the following lines to Marian:  "My dear Marian-my dear, generous, long-suffering wife- come to my aid. My grandfather has been suddenly stricken downwith apoplexy, and is dying. The physician has not yet arrived, and I cannot leave his bedside. Return with my mes-   THE   BODY   ON  THE  BEACH,    491 senger, to assist me in taking care of the dying man. Youn, who are the angel of the sick and suffering, will not refuse me  your aid.

I will send a message to Edith to set her anxiety at rest, or I will send for her to be with you here. ' Come to me, be- loved Marian. Dictate your own conditions if you will--only come. " He had scarcely sealed this note, when the boy, hat in hand, appeared at the door. "Take this note, sir, jump in the gig and drive as fast as possible to the -beach below Pine Bluffs. You will see Miss Mayfield waiting there, give her this note, and then-await het orders. Be quicker than you ever were before," said Thurston, hurrying his messenger off. Then much relieved of anxiety upon Marian's account,-:he returned to the sick-room, and renewed his endeavors to relieve the patient. Ahl he was far past relief now; he was stricken with death. And with Thurston, all thoughts, all feelings, all interests, even those connected with Marian, were soon lost in that awful pre- sence. It was the first time he had ever looked upon death, and now, in the rushing tide of his sinful passions' and impetu- ous will, he was brought face to 'face with this last, dread, all- conquering power I What if it were not in his own person?

This recalled Marian to his mind; it was nearly time for her to arrive; he hoped that she was near the house; that she Would soon be there; he arose and went to the window to look forth into the night; but the deep darkness prevented his see- ing, as the noise of the storm prevented his hearing the ap- proach of any vehicle that might be near. He went back to the bedside ; the old man was breathing his life away without a struggle. Thurston called the mulatto housekeeper to take his place, and then went down stairs and out of the hall door, and gazed and listened for the coming of the gig, in vain. He was just about to re-enter the hall and close the door, when the sound of wheels, dashing violently, helter-skelter, and with break-neck speed into the yard, arrested his attention. "Marian it is my dear Marian at last; but the fellow need not risk her life to save her from the storm by driving at that rate. My own Marian!" he exclaimed, as he hurried out, ex- pecting to meet her. Melchizedek alone sprang from the gig, and sank trembling and quaking at his master's feet. Thurston blindly pushed past him, and peered and felt in the gig. It was empty. "Where is the lady, sirrah? What ails you? Why don't you answer me?" exclaimed Thurston, anxiously returning to the spot where the, boy crouched. But the latter remained speechless, trembling, groaning, and wringing his hands. "Will you speak, idiot? I ask you where is the lady? was she not upon the beach? What has frightened you so? Did the horse run away?" inquired Thurston, hurriedly, in great alarm. "Oh, sir, marster I I 'spects she's killed!" "Killed I Oh, my God! she has been thrown from the gig!" cried the young man, in a piercing voice, as he reeled under this blow. In another instant he sprang upon the poor boy, and shaking him furiously, cried in a voice of mingled grief, ,.   THE  BODY   ON  THE   BEACH.   493 rage, and anxiety-"Where was she thrown, sir?

It was Thurston's own weapon, that he had lost some months' previous in the woods of Luckenough. It was a costly and; curious specimen of French taste and ingenuity. The handle was of pearl, carved in imitation of the sword-fish, and the blade corresponded to the long pointed beak that gives the fish that name.  Thurston scarcely noticed that. it was his dagger, but pusih ing the boy aside, he ran to the stables, saddled a- horse with the swiftness of thought, threw himself into' his stirrups, aind galloped furiously away towards the beach. The rain was now falling in torrents, and the wind driving it in fierce gusts against his face. The tempest was at its very height, and it seemed at times impossible to breast the blast- it seemed as though steed and rider must be overblown I Yet he lashed aid spurred his horse, and struggled desperately on, thin-:t ing with fierce anguish of Marian, his Marian, lying :wobndd,: helpless, alone and dying, exposed to all the fury of theiwiiidl and waves upon that tempestuous coast, and dreading with horror; lest, before he should be able to reach her, her lielplesi 31 y  &#xD;<pb n="494-495" xml:id="VAC7871-00000240"/> "4     T HE  MSS I N   BRIDE. form, still living, might be washed off by the advancing waves. Thus he spurred. and lashed his horse, and drove him against rain and wind, and through the darkness of the night. With all his desperate haste, it was two hours before he ap- proached the beach. And as he drew near, the heavy cannon.. ading of the waves upon the shore admonished him that the tide was at its highest pint. He pressed rapidly onward, threw himself from his horse, and ran forward to the edge of the bank above the beach. It was only to meet the confirma- tion of his worst fears. The waters were thundering against the bank upon which he stood. The tide had come in and overswept the whole beach, and now, lashed and driven by the wind, the waves tossed and raved and roared with appalling fury. Marian was gone, lost, swept away by the waves! that was the thought that wrung from him a cry of fierce agony, piercing through all the discord of the storm, as he ran up and down the shore, hoping nothing, expecting nothing, yet totally unable to tear himself from the fatal spot. And so he wildly walked and raved, until his garments were drenched through with the rain; until the storm exhausted its fury and subsided; until the changing atmosphere, the still, severe cold, froze all his clothing stiff around him; so he walked, groaning and crying and calling despairingly upon the name of Marian, until the night waned and the morning dawned, and the eastern horizon grew golden, then crimson, then fiery with the coming sun. The sky was clear, the waters calm, the sands bare and glis- tening in the early sunbeams; no vestige of the storm or of the bloody outrage of the night remained-all was peace and beauty. In the distance was a single snow-white sail, floating swan-like on the bosom of the blue waters. All around was beauty and peace, yet from the young man's tortured bosom peace had fled, and remorse, vulture-like, had struck its talons deep into his heart. He called himself a murderer the de- stroyer of Marian; he said it was his selfishness, his willfulness,    THE  BODY  ON  THE  BEACH,    495' his treachery, that had exposed her to this danger, and brought her to this fate I Some outlaw, some waterman, or fugitive negro had robbed and murdered her. Marian usually wore a very valuable watch; probably, also, she had money about her person--enough to have tempted the cupidity of some lawless wretch. He shrunk in horror from pursuing conjecture-it was worse than torture, worse than madness to him. Oh, blind-. ness and frenzy! why had he not thought of these dangers so likely to beset her solitary path? Why had he sO recklessly ex- posed her to them? Vain questions, alas I vain as was his self- reproach, his anguish and despair  In the meantime, how had the morning broken upon Dell- Delight? how upon Luckenough? and how at Old Field Cot- tage? At Dell-Delight, the old man had expired just before the sun arose. The two physicians that had been summoned the night previous, but had been delayed by the storm, arrived in the morning only to see the patient die. Many inquiries were made, and much conjecture formed, as to the cause of Thurston Will- coxen's improper and unaccountable absence at such a juncture. But Melchizedek, poor, faithful fellow, having followed his mas- ter's steps, did not appear, and no one else upon the premises could give any explanation relative to the movements of their young master. He had left the bedside of his dying relative at nine o'clock the night before, and he had not since returned-- his saddle-horse was gone from the stable-that was all :that could be ascertained. Dr. Brightwell took his departure, to answer other pressing calls. But Dr. Weismann, seeing that there was no responsible person in charge, and having elsewhere. no urgent demands upon his time and attention, kindly volun- teered to stay and superintend affairs at Dell-Delight, until the reappearance of the young master. At Old Field Cottage, Edith-had sat up late the night nefore waiting for Marian; but seeing that she. did not return, had   &#xD;<pb n="496-497" xml:id="VAC7871-00000241"/> "6     THE  MSSING   BRIDE.  taken it for granted that she had remained all night with Miss Thornton, and so, without the least uneasiness at her prolonged absence, had retired to rest. And in the morning she arose with the same impression on her mind, gayly looking forward to Marian's return with the visitor, and the certain happy reve- lation she had promised.  She had breakfast over early, made the room very tidy, dressed Miriam in her holiday clothes, put on her own Sunday gown, and sat down to wait for Marian and the visitor. The morning passed slowly, in momentary expectation of an arrival. It was near eleven o'clock when she looked up and saw Colonel Thornton's carriage approaching the cottage. "There! I said so! I knew Marian had remained with Miss Thornton, and that they would bring her home this morn- ing. I suppose Colonel Thornton and his sister are both with her I And now for the revelation! I wonder what it is," said Edith, smiling to herself, as she arose and stroked down her dress, and smoothed her ringlets, preparatory to meeting her guests. By this time the carriage had. drawn up before the cottage gate. Edith went out just in time to see the door opened, and Miss Thornton alight. The lady was alone-that Edith saw at the first glance, and, "What can be the meaning of this?" she asked herself, as she went forward to welcome her visitor. But Miss Thornton was very pale and tremulous, and she acted altogether strangely. "How do you do, Miss Thornton? I am very glad to see you," said Edith, cordially offering her hand. But the lady seized it, and drew her forcibly towards the door, saying, in a husky voice, "Come in-come in." Full of surprise, Edith followed her. "Sit down," she continued, sinking into a chair, and point- ing to a vacant one by her side. Edith took the seat, and waited in wonder for her fartner speech.    I "   "; Where is Marian?" asked Miss Thornton, in an agitated voice. "Where? Why, I believed her to be at your house 1" an- swered Edith, in surprise and vague fear. Good heaven!" exclaimed the lady, growing very pale, and trembling in every limb. Edith started up in alarm, "Miss Thornton, what do you mean? For mercy sake, tell me, has anything happened?" "I do not knoww-I am not sure-I trust not-tell me I when did you see her last? when did she leave home? this morning?" No I last evening, about sundown."   ' "And she has not returned? you have not seen her since?" "No!" "Did she tell you where she was going?" "No!" "Did she promise to come back? and when?" "he promised to return before dark! she did not do so I judged the storm had detained her, and that she was with you, and I felt easy." "Oh, God!" cried the lady, in a voice of deep distress, and burying her face in her hands.  "Miss Thornton! for Heaven's sakel tell me what has oc- curred!'  ". Oh, Edith!"  "In mercy, explain yourself-Marian I what of Marian?" "Oh, God, sustain you, Edith I what can I say to you? my own heart is lacerated "' : "Marian!

Edith " said the lady, going up and putting her arms around the fragile form of the young widow, as to shield and support her. "Oh, Edith I heard a report this morning --and it may be but a report-I pray Heaven, that it is no more-" "Oh, go on I what, what was it?" "That, that last evening on the beach during the storm, Ma- rian Mayfield-" Miss Thornton's voice choked. "Oh, speak I for mercy speak I What of Marian?" "That Marian Mayfield had been waylaid, and-" "Murdered! oh, God!" cried Edith, as her overstrainet nerves relaxed, and she sunk in the arms of Miss Thornton. A child's wild, frenzied shriek resounded through the house. It was the voice of Miriam. At Luckenough that morning, the remains of the unfortunate Doctor Grimshaw were laid out preparatory to burial. Jac- quelina, in a bewildered stupor of remorse, wandered vaguely from room to room, seeking rest and finding none. "I have caused a fellow creature's death l" That was the envenomed thought that corroded her heart's centre. From her bosom, too, peace had fled. It was near noon when the news of Ma- rian's fate reached Luckenough, and overwhelmed the family with consternation and grief. But Jacquelinal the effect of the tragic tale on her was nearly fatal. She understood the catastrophe as no one else could 1 She knew who struck the fatal blow, and when, and why, and under what mistake it was struck I She felt that an- other crime, another death lay heavy on her soul! It was too much! oh I it was too much I no human heart nor brain could sustain the crushing burden, and the poor lost elf fell into convulsions that threatened soon to terminate in death. There was -no raving, no talking, in all her frenzy, the fatal secret weighing on her bosom did not then transpire. ,Before the day was out the whole county was in an uproar. ,;   THE  BODY  ON  THE  BEACH.    499 -'Never had any event of the neighborhood created so high an excitement or so profound, a sympathy. Great horror and amazement filled every bosom. A county meeting sponta- neously convened, and handbills were printed, large rewards offered, and every means taken to secure the discovery of the criminal. In the deep absorbing sympathy for Marian's fate, the sudden death of Professor Grimshaw, and the reasonably-to- be-expected demise of old Mr. Cloudesley Willcoxen, passed nearly unnoticed, and were soon forgotten. Among the: most zealous in the pursuit of the unknown- murderer, was Thurston Willcoxen; but the ghastly pallor of his countenance, the wild- ness of his eyes, and the distraction of his manner, often varied by fits of deep and sullen despair, excited the surprise and con- jecture of all who looked upon him. Days passed and still no light was thrownupon the mystery. About a fortnight after the catastrophe, however, inforination was brought to the neighborhood that the corpse of a woman, answering to the description of Marian, had been washed ashore some miles down the coast, but had been interred by-the fishermen, the day after its discovery. Many gentlemen hurried down to the spot, and farther investigation confirmed the gene- ral opinion that the body was that of the martyred girl. Three weeks after this, Edith lay upon her death-bed; her delicate frame never recovered this last great shock. A few days before her death she called-Miriam to her bedside.' The child approached; ;she was sadly altered within the last few weeks; incessant weeping had dimmed her splendid eyes, and paled her brilliant cheeks. , "Sit down upon the bed by me, my daughter," said Edith. The child climbed up and took the indicated seat. Some- thing of that long smothered fire, which had once braved the fury of the British soldiers, kindled in the dying woman's eyes. "Miriam, you are nearly nine years old in time, and much older than that in thought and feeling.

My child, do you follow and understand me?"  "( Yes, mamma." "Do not weep, tears are vain and idle. There was an in- jured queen once whose tears were turned to sparks of fire. So I would have yours to turn I You know what Marian has always been to you, but, oh! you do not know all that she was to me before you ever lived. I should have perished, far from my native land, in poverty and sorrow, but for Marian. She came a stranger to me in my extremity, she watched over, nursed, toiled for me, and when her labor could not procure all the comforts of life, she sold her little girlish ornaments and keepsakes to get them for me. By unremitted care, she raised me at last, from a sick bed, and got me into a ship, and brought me  across the sea to this my native country. Nor here did her tenderness and care slacken the least. While those from whom nature gave me the right to expect aid and sympathy, withheld both, she, upon whom I had not the slight- est claim, beyond the fragile one of common, human sisterhood, stood firmly by us, working for, comforting, supporting me; her girlish head and heart and hands willingly assuming the :burden that should have been otherwise borne by manhood and money. You, Miriam, must have perished in your infancy but for her, for, when Heaven sent you here, I was too deeply prostrated in mind and body to love you, or take care of you the least. But she pitied the poor little stranger, and took it to her girlish bosom, and loved and nursed it with all a mother's devotion, and more than a mother's disinterestedness. -You grew up in her arms. I  sometimes think you loved her more than you love me-well, she deserved it. For oh I she was the most dis- interested being that I ever saw. She came among us a young stranger girl, without fortune or position, or any of the usual stepping stones to social consideration. Yet see what influence what power she soon obtained, and what reforms and improve- ments she soon effected. The county is rich in the monuments of her young wisdom and angelic goodness.

Others have pursued the search for the murderer with great zeal for awhile; we must make that search the one great object of our lives. Upon us devolve the right and the duty to avenge her death by bringing her destroyer to the scaffold- Miriam, do you hear-do you hear and understand me?" "Yes, mamma-yes--'  "Chld, listen to niMe I I have a clue to Marian's murderer." Miriam started, and attended breathlessly. "My love, it was no poor waterman  or fugitive negro, tempted by want or cupidity. It was a gentleman, Miriam." "A gentleman!" "Yes, one that she must have become acquainted with dur- ing her visit to Washington three years ago. Oh! I remember her unaccountable distress in the months that followed th6.t visit I His name, or his assumed name, was-attend, Miriam I -Thomas Truman."  "Thomas Truman it" "Yes I and while you live, remember that name, until its owner hangs upon the gallows." Miriam shuddered, and hid her pale face in her hands. "Here," said Edith, taking a small packet of letters from under her pillow. "Here, Miriam, is a portion of her crres- pondence with this man, Thomas Truman-I found it in the secret drawer'of her bureau. . There are several- notes entreat- ing her to give him a meeting-on the beach, at Mossy Dell, and at other points-from the tenor of these notes, I am led to believe that she refused these meetings--and more than that, from the style of one in particular I am induced to suppose that she might have been privately married to that man., Why he should have enticed her to that spot to destroy her life, I do not know. But this, at least, I know, that our dearest Marian has been basely assassinated. I see reason to suppose the sg- sassin to have been her lover, or her husband, and that his real  or assumed name was Thomas Truman.

But by following a slight clue, we are sometimes led to great discoveries-" "Why didn't you show them to the gentlemen, dear mamma? they might have found out something by them."  "I showed them to Thurston Willcoxen, who has teen so energetic in the pursuit of the unknown murderer; but Thurs- ton became so violently agitated, that I thought he must have fallen. And he wished very much to retain those letters, but I would not permit them to be carried out of my sight. When he became calmer, however, he assured me 'that there could be no possible connection between the writer of these notes and the murderer of the unfortunate girl. I, however, think differ- ently-I think there is a connection, and even an identity; and I think this packet may be'the means of bringing the criminal to justice; and I leave it-a sacred trust-in your charge, Miriam. Guard it well I guard it as your only treasure, until it has served its destined purpose. And now, Miriam, do you know the nature of a vow?" "Yes, mamma?" "Do you understand its solemnity? its obligation? its invio- lability?"  "I think I do, mamma." "Do you know that in the performance of your vow, if ne- cessary, no toil, no privation, no suffering of mind or body, no dearest interest of your life, no strongest affection of your soul, but must be sacrificed-do you comprehend all this?" "Yes, mamma, I knew it before-and 1 have read of Jep- thah and his daughter." "Now, Miriam, kneel down, fold your hands, and give them to me Between my own-look into my eyes. I want you to make a vow to God and to your dying mother, to avenge the death of Marian. Will you bind your soul by such an obliga- tion?" The child was magnetized by the thrilling eyes that gazed deep into. her own-she answered,    THE  BODY  ON  THE  BEACH.;    503 Yes, mamma.' ( You vow in the sight of God and all his holy angels, that as you hope for salvation, you will devote your life with all your faculties of mind and body, to the discovery and punish. ment of Marian's murderer; and also that you will live a maiden until you become an avenger." "I vow." Swear that no afterthought shall tempt you to falter-that happen what may in the changing years, you will not hesitate --that though your interests and affections should intervene, you will not suffer them to retard you in your purpose; that no effort, no sacrifice, no privation, no suffering of mind or body shall be spared, if needful, to the accomplishment of your vow." "I swear." "You will do it I You are certain to discover the murderer, and clear up the mystery." The mental excitement that had carried Edith through this scene subsided, and left her very weak, so that when Thurston. Willcoxen soon after called to see her, she was unable to re- ceive him. The next morning, however, Thurston repeated his visit, and- was brought to the bedside of the invalid. Thurston was frightfully changed, the sufferings of the last month seemed to have made him old-his countenance was worn, his voice hollow, and his manner abstracted and uncertain. "'Edith," he asked, as he took the chair near her head, "do you feel stronger this morning?" "Yes-I always do in the forenoon." "Do you feel well enough to talk of Miriam and her future?" "Oh, yes." "What have you proposed to do with her?" "I shall leave her to Aunt Henrietta-she will never let the child want." ' But Mrs. Waugh is quite an old lady now.

"I know it--oh! I know it;; why do you speak of it, sinee I can do no otherwise?" "To point out how you may do otherwise, dear Edith. It would have been cruel to mention it else.' She looked up at him with surprise and inquiry. "Edith, you have known me from my boyhood. You know what Iam. Will you leave your orphan daughter to me? You look at me in wonder; but listen, dear Edith, and then decide. Marian-dear martyred saintl loved that child as her own. And I loved Marina-loved her as I had never deemedBit pos- sible for heart to ]ove-I cannot speak of this! it deprives me of reason," he said, suddenly covering his eyes with his hands, while a spasm agitated his worn face. In a few minutes he resumed. "Look at me, Edith I the death of Marian has brought me to what you see I  My youth has melted away like a morning mist. I have not an object in life except to carry out purposes which were dear to her benevolent heart, and which her sudden death has left incomplete. I have not an affection in the world: except that which comes through her. I should love this chi:d dearly, and cherish her devotedly for Marian's sake. I shall never change my bachelor life--but I  should -like to legally adopt little Miriam. I should give her the best educational advantages, and make her the co heir with my young brother Paul Douglas, of all I possess. Say, Edith, can you trust your child to me?" Hie spoke earnestly, fervently, taking her hand and pressing it, and gazing pleadingly into her eyes. "So you loved Marian--I even judged so when I saw you labor hardest of all for the apprehension of the criminal. Oh, many loved her as much as you I Colonel Thornton, Doctor Weismann, Judge Gordon, Mr. Barnwell, all adored her! Ah I she was worthy of it?", ":No more of that, dear Edith, it will overcome us both i but tell me if you willgive me your little girl?" '   "Dear Thurston, your proposal is as strange and unusual as it is generous. I thank you most sincerely, but you-must give- me time to look at it and think of it.  You are sincere, you are in earnest, you mean all you say. I see that in your face; but I must reflect and take counsel upon such an important step. Go now, dear Thurston, and return to me at this hour to-mor- row morning." Thurston pressed 'her hand and departed. The same day Edith had a   visit from Mrs. Waugh, Miss Thornton, and other friends. And after advising with them upon the proposal that had been made her, she decided to leave Miriam in thejoint guardianship of Mrs. Waugh and Thuirston Willcoxen. And this decision was made known to Thurston when he called the next morning. A few days after this Edith passed to the world of spirits. And Thurston took the orphan child to his own heart and home CHAPTER    XX'X VII. MARIAN.

With no power of recollection, with no power of understand. ing, scarcely conscious of her own identity, scarcely conscious of her existence, she lay helpless as a new-born infant. Shadows were about her everywhere--shadows on the out- ward scene-shadows on her mind, and shadows on her heart- yes I heavier than all-upon her heart-the impression of some dread loss and sorrow, deep and immutable as the grave, lay burdening her bosom-what was it? she could not tell-nay, she could not even inquire of her pemory-so feeble, so uncer- tain was her vital action. A square of dim light, or rather of thinner darkness, was over her feet. She did not know or even wonder what it was she saw; a monotonous low surging sounded on her ear-she did not know or speculate what it was she heard; a gentle rocking motion soothed and lulled her-she did not know, or care to' find out what it was she felt. Nay, she did not know or seek to know herself Gradually, very gradually came the faculty of thought and recollection; first, she dimly remembered the last hour in night and storm upon the beach, when, as she drew the steel from her bosom, the scene had swam around her and disappeared, carrying all consciousness of life away with it. And now this awakening? Was it in the spiritual or in the material world? if in the latter-were these shadows the sha- dows of a vault around her? She could not tell! But no I there was the square of dim light over her feet, and it was di-. vided off into oblong divisions-it was a window, an elevated window, and the only view it afforded was that of a cloudy night sky. Where was she? The monotonous rocking and humming continued-it soothed her senses as the nurse's crade-hymn soothes the infant-and too wearied to feel or think, Marian closed her eyes in slumber, and lost all consciousness until she awoke again. She woke with a rather clearer recollection of what had oc- curred before her fall upon the beach, yet with no certain know- ledge of what had happened since. It was lighter around her now-the square of light beyond     MARIAN.            50T her feet, showed the ruddy glow of the eastern horizon, and below, the opening stairs were dimly to be seen. She turned' her eyes around-there were berths each side of the place--. there was a bureau and a wash-stand, yet they reeled and rocked as she did. A very slight noise attracted her attention-she turned her eyes in the direction whence it came, to the right hand corner of her bed's head, and there she vaguely perceived a lady, who stood at a little stand and seemed engaged in pouring some- thing from a vial into a cup. While she watched this lady, the latter turned around, and gently. raising the patient's head, put the cup to her lips. Marian drank as a babe might have drank, and then sank back upon the pillow and relapsed into sleep. And life was blotted out for several hours. Once more she awoke-it was now high noon. She knew where she was, now; in the neat, well-ordered cabin of a ves- sel; the square of light beyond her feet was' the window in the door at the head of the gangway; she saw through it a por- tion of the deck and the ropes, and the sea ahead, and the sky beyond. Yes, she was on shipboard; but how did she happen to be there? She strove to recall the past-and then again came memory much"elearer and fuller than before, and wrung a deep shuddering groan from her heart; and then a sharp, lace- rating pang struck through all her chest, and caught away her breath; she closed her. eyes, bunt at- the same time felt a gentle arm slip under her shoulders and raise her up, and a cup placed to her lips. It must have contained some elixir at once ano- dyne, sedative and nourishing, for as soon as she had swallowed it, indifference and repose came to mind and body. While she  lay in that state, another person entered the cabin, and inquired, "How is your patient, dear Rachel?" "Her wound troubles her, I think," answered the sweetest  voice Marian had ever heard. "What are you doing there?" "I am preparing a soothing application for it; and now, as I am about to dress it, you will please to retire, dear."  &#xD;<pb n="508-509" xml:id="VAC7871-00000247"/> 508     -- HE  MSSING   BRIDE. Soon after this, Marian felt a pair of soft hands uncover- ing her bosom. She opened her eyes, and saw bending over her, the sweetest face she had ever seen-fair, pale, and gentle, dark gray eyes, and smoothly braided dark-brown hair. Ma- rian strove to speak, but the effort started that acute pain that held her very breath suspended. "You must not try to speak, dear-- do not even try to think; you must consent to be as much like a dormouse as possible," said the gentle lady, while her soft, soothing fingers removed the linen bandages, and bathed and dressed the wound. Marian's eyes gazed pleadingly in her face. "You are with friends, dear, who will -attend you faithfully' until you can be restored to your family. In a day or two you will be able to direct our inquiries. And that you may the sooner be in a condition to do so, you must now be still and patient," said the lady. Still that eager questioning gaze? Marian would have given the world for the power to ask one question-"Where is Thurston?"But she could not; nay, the fear of committing him, would have held her silent. Her own life assured, she thought only of him, of his safety, his liberty, and his honor. Strange, clinging, deathless affection; immortal love that all the power of evil cannot kill; divine love that hate, and scorn, and treachery, and cruelty, can never move to anger or revenge- can only move to sorrow and compassion, and renewed hope and effort. It may not be a merit-perhaps nothing so invo- luntary can be a merit. Yet neither is it a weakness or reproach -no, by its strength to suffer, to labor, to hope, and to re- deem-by the sacrifice on Calvary, by all that is best and strongest on earth, and in heaven, it is not a weakness or a red proach:I The soul gifted with such power of pure loving, is the medium of the Lord; it is the Father of Love who loveth through it.  In Marian's heart the thought of Thurston caused the pro- foundest grief and pity, and while she lay there speechless, motionless, outwardly calm, her inner life was disturbed by con-   MARIAN.           '5o09 ficts and struggles to whih her nature had hitherto been a stranger. Those who have ever suffered high nervous fever, aggravated by grief, doubt, or anxiety-and who have lain long days and nights, cut off from conversation with the outer world, know, at such times, how dramatic becomes the inner life-how every separate faculty of the mind, and eyery individual passion and affection of the heart takes a distinct personality, and what con- flicts they have-how many voices speak, and what contro- versies they hold. So it was with Marian in her illness. - Heart and head-reason and affection, were at war with each other. The heart refused to associate the idea of Thurs- ton with the treachery and violence by which she hai suffered. "It is impossible, utterly impossible, that he could have sunk to such a depth of crime-I do not and cannot believe it," pleaded the heart.

"Ah, but there are some cases in which we doubt the evi- dence of our senses, and this is one. He did not do it." "Why should you doubt?" "Oh, his looks, his manner, his tone, his expression, all I know of him, contradicts the possibility of his doing such a thing."  "Yes, but poor heart, see here!

Did he not use every art to beguile you into a secret marriage?

Did he keep that promise? Did he not use every argument, persuasion, and threat to induce you to forego fair fame, friends, peace, all in his favor? Upon your steady refusal, did he not wring you by his long estrangement? Was not the whole of his conduct, from the beginning to this point, premeditated? Answer!" "Oh I no, no, I never believed it so. His conduct sprung from impulse, not premeditation." "Undeceive yourself, poor heart; after having failed in his plan to geot you off to France, what happened? Why, he gave you up, and transferred all his attentions to another-a pretty young heiress, in every way very acceptable to his friends." "It was only done to pique me. It was only a ruse of lore!" "Ah, shrinking heart! Ah, shrinking, cowardly heart sum- mon all your courage to look on the face of truth! When you interfered, did he not threaten?

He appointed that rendezvous-you kept it--and met, from his hand, what had nearly been your death. Do you still doubt?"^ "Yes, yes, yes-in the face of all that, I doubt." And so worked up into fever by the conflict of faith with testimony, and love with reason; and suffering, beneath all, an under-current of great sorrow, Marian rolled and tossed upon her bed of mental and physical anguish. Not only once 6r twice, but over and over again, was this internal controversy held. And all these conflicts retarded her convalescence. Day followed day, and her strength was not aug ented, nor her power of speech recovered. With matchless pcarity and patience, the lady called "Rachel" attended her bedside. But no explanation ensued between them. Thus several days passed --how many, Marian did' not know; when one noon she was awakened from her sleep by the sudden cessation of that- rolling motion that had soothed her senses so long a time, and opening her eyes, she saw the gangway glimpses of a thicket of masts, and farther on a crowded pier-and she knew the ves- sel had anchored in some harbor. While her mournful eyes were fixed in sad inquiry upon the scene, Rachel came with pencil and paper in her hand, and sat down by the bedside, and said, quietly, We are in New York harbor, dear. This vessel sails for Liverpool in a day or two. My husband and myself go with it; but we will first see you in a place of safety, well attended and provided for, until your friends can reach you. And now, dear, tell me to whom I shall write; here, take this pencil and paper, and set down the name and place of residence." Marian took the writing materials-paused-closed her eyes, and seemed to be engaged in thought or in prayer, then sh&amp;. scrawled a few words on the paper, and then her hand dropped.- exhausted.              ^, Rachel took up the scrap, and with some difficulty, jleci- phered the following words, which she read aloud, to receive further confirmation from the writer:--  &#xD;<pb n="512-513" xml:id="VAC7871-00000249"/> 512     THE  MSSING- BRIDE. "Take me to Liverpool-I have friends and money there-.. it is my native place." "Is that what you mean, dear?" Marian bowed her head. And Rachel took the scrap of paper, and left the cabin. Soon she returned with her hus. band, who, coming to the bedside, asked, "You really wish to go to Liverpool, young lady?" Marian bowed her head. "You say that you have friends there." Marian bowed again, and made signs for the pencil and paper-and when they were given her, she managed to scrawl two words;l "My letirs!" Oh, you want the letters that were found with you--here they are," said the lady, as soon as she had read the scrap; going to a beaufet and bringing out the packet. Marian signed that she should give them to her husband, and that he should read them. The reading occupied perhaps fifteen minutes, and when it was over, he said, "You shall go to Liverpool with us, young lady; and we will serve you to the best of our ability, until we resign you into the care of your friends." Marian faintly bowed her thanks. "And now, Reuben, we must let her rest, or her fever will rise," said Rachel. The gentleman retired, and the gentle lady administered a cooling sedative to her patient, and sat down by the bed and bathed her head until she fell asleep. The next morning after breakfast, when Rachel took her place as usual by the side of the invalid, Marian made signs for ,encil and paper, and when they were put in her hands, she *rote, "Please tell me how I came on board of this vessel." "I fear the subject will excite you too much," said Rachel, when she had read the words. "Not so much to hear as to keep wondering about it," wrote Marian the second time.   MARIAN            513 "In that case I will tell you. It is not much to tell, dear. On the evening of Holy Thursday, about the time the storm arose, our vessel lay to opposite a place on St. Mary's coast, called Pine Bluff, and the mate put off in a boat to land a passenger; as they neared the shore they met another boat rowed by two men, who seemed so anxious to escape observa- tion, as to row away as fast as they could without answering our boat's salute. Our mate thought'very strange of it at the time; but the mysterious boat was swiftly hid in the darkness, and our boat reached the land. The mate and his man had to help to carry the passenger's trunks up to the top of the bluff; and a short distance beyond, where a carriage was kept waiting for him, and after they had parted from him, they returned down the bluff by a shorter though steeper way; and just as they reached the beach, in the momentary lull of the storm, they heard groans. Immediately the men connected those sounds with the strange boat they had seen row away, and they raised the wick in the lantern, and threw its light around,' and soon discovered you upon the sands, moaning, though nearly insensible. They naturally concluded that you had been the victim of the men in the boat, who were probably pirates. Their first impulse was to pursue the carriage, and get you placed within it, and taken to some farm house for assistance; but a moment's reflection convinced them that such a plan was futile, as it was impossible to overtake the carriage. There was also no house near the coast. Tley thought it" likely that you were a stranger to that part of the country. And in the hurry and agitation of the moment, they could devise nothing better than to put you in the boat, and bring you on board this vessel. That is the way you came here," concluded the gentle woman, refraining from expressing any curiosity, or asking any question, lest it might disturb her patient. The grateful gaze of Marian thanked her, as she held out her hand for the pencil, and wrote, "Tell me the name of my angel nurse." *  -  f  &#xD;<pb n="514-515" xml:id="VAC7871-00000250"/> 514     THE  MSSIN S  BIIDE. "Rachel Holmes," answered the lady, blushing gently. "My husband is a surgeon in the United States army He is on leave of absence now for the purpose of taking me home to see my father and mother-they live in London. I am of English parentage." Marian feebly pressed her hand, and then irregularly traced these words, "You are very good to ask me no questions, and I thank you with all my heart; for, dear lady, I can tell you nothing," and having written them, her hand dropped powerless upon the bed-for she was entirely exhausted by this short conference. The next day the vessel sailed with the first tide for Liverpool. Marian slowly improved. Her purposes were not very clear or strong yet-mental and physical suffering and exhaustion had temporarily weakened and obscured her mind. Her one strong impulse was to escape, to get away from the scenes of such painful associations and memories, and to go home, to take refuge in her own native land. 'The thought of returning to Maryland, to meet the astonishment, the wonder, the con- jectures, the inquiries, and perhaps the legal investigation that might lead to the exposure and punishment of Thurston, was insupportable to her heart. No, no! rather let the width of -the ocean divide her from all those horrors. Undoubtedly her friends believed her dead-let it be so-let her remain as dead to them. She should leave no kindred behind her, to suffer by her loss-should wrong no human being. True, there were Miriam and Edith I But that her heart was exhausted by its one great, all-consuming grief, it must have bled for them! Yet they had already suffered all they could possibly suffer from the supposition of her death-it was now three weeks since they had reason to believe her dead, and doubtless kind Nature had already nursed them into resignation and calmness, that would in time become cheerfulness. If she should go back, there would be the shock, the amazement, the questions, the prosecutions, perhaps the conviction, and the sentence, and the horrors of a state prison for one, the least hair of whose   MARIAN.           515 head she could not willingly hurt; and then her own early death, or should she survive, her blighted life. Could these consequences console or benefit Edith or Miriam? No, no, they would augment grief. It was better to leave things as they were-better to remain dead to them-a dead sorrow might be forgotten-a living one neverl For herself, it was bettet to take fate as she found it-to go home to England, and devote her newly restored life, and her newly acquired fortune, to those benevolent objects that had so lately occupied so large a share of her heart. Some means also should be found-when she should grow stronger, and her poor head should be clearer, so that she should be able to think-to make Edith and Miriam the recipients of all the benefit her wealth could possibly confer upon them. And so in recollecting, meditating, planning, and trying to reason correctly, and to understand her embarrassed position, and her difficult duty, passed the days of her convalescence. As her mind cleared, the thought of Angelica began to give her uneasiness-she could not bear to think of leaving that young lady exposed to the misfortune of becoming Thurston's wife-and her mind toiled with the difficult problem of how to shield Angelica without exposing Thurston. A few days after this, when Marian had recovered the power of speech, she related to her kind friends all of her personal history that she could impart, without compromising the safety of others: and she required and received from themn the pro- mise of their future silence in regard to her fate. As they approached the shores of England, Marian improved so fast as to be able to go on deck. And though extremely pale and thin, she could no longer be considered an invalid, when, on the thirtieth day-out, their ship entered the mouth of the Mersey. Upon their arrival at Liverpool, it had been the intention of Doctor Holmes and his wife to proceed to London; but now they decided to delay a few hours until they should see Marian safe in the house of her friends -The Reverend Theodore Burney was a retired dissenting clergyman, living on  &#xD;<pb n="516-517" xml:id="VAC7871-00000251"/> 516     TttE.

Doctor Holmes took a chaise and carried Marian and Rachel out to the place. The house was nearly overgrown with climb' ing vines, and the grounds were -beautiful with the early spring verdure and flowers. The old man was overjoyed to meet Marian, and he received her with a father's welcome. He thanked her friends for their care and attention, and pressed them to come and stay several days or weeks. But Doctor Holmes and Rachel simply explained that their visit was to their parents in London, which city they were very anxious to reach as soon as possible, and, thanking their host, they took leave of him, of his old wife, and Marian, and departed. The old minister looked hard at Marian. -"You are pale, my dear. Well, I always heard that our fresh island roses withered in the dry heat of the American climate, and now I know it! But come I we shall soon see a change} and what wonders native air and native manners and morning walks will work in the way of restoring bloom." Marian did not feel bound to reply, and her ill health re- mained charged to the account of our unlucky atmosphere. The next morning, the old gentleman took Marian into his library, told her once more how very little surprised, and how very glad he was that instead of writing, she had come in per- son. He then made her acquainted with certain documents, and informed her that it would be necessary she should go up to London, and advised her to do so just as soon as she should feel herself sufficiently rested. Marian declared herself to 1e already recovered of fatigue, and anxious to proceed with the business of settlement. Their journey was thereupon fixed for the second day from that time. And upon the appointed morning, Marian, attended by the old clergyman, set out for the mammoth capital, where, in due season, they arrived. A few days were busily occupied amid the lumber of law docu- ments, before Marian felt sufficiently at ease to advise her friends, the Holmeses, of her presence in town. Only a few   NEW   LI EF .         517 hours had elapsed, after reading her note and address, before She received a call from Mrs. Holmes and her father, Doctor Coleman, a clergyman of high standing in the Church of England. Friendliness and a beautiful simplicity characterised the man- ners of both father and daughter. Rachel entreated Marian to return with her and make her father's house her home while in London. She spoke with an affectionate sincerity that Marian could neither doubt nor- resist, and when Dr. Coleman cordially seconded his daughter's intention, Marian gratefully accepted the proffered hospitality. And the same day Mr. Burney bade a temporary farewell to his favorite, and departed for Liver- pool, and Marian accompanied her-friend Rachel Holmes to the house of Dr. Coleman. CHAPTER XXXVIII. NEW    LIFE. "Live I for some high and holy work of love, 'And thou an angel's happiness shalt know, Shall bless the earth, while in the world above The good begun by thee shall onward go In many a branching stream, and ever wider flow.-Cartos 'Wikox. MARIAN had many worthy reasons for wishing to cultivate the acquaintance and friendship of Dr. Coleman.   The first of which was that she desired to consult' him upon the subject- of her beneficent purposes, and to have the aid of his greater experience and wisdom to guide her in the application of meant to ends.  When one morning in his library, Marian presented the subject to the doctor, that reverend gentleman was greatly surprised that a lady so young and beahtiful, one without the least bit of fanaticism whatever, should simply resolve to devote: her life and wealth to the unfortunate. Ee could scarcely rfdo-  &#xD;<pb n="518-519" xml:id="VAC7871-00000252"/> 518      THE   MSSING   BRIDE. bear from expressing his amazement, and he could not refrain from expostulation. But Marian gravely and gently waived his objections aside, saying, "Circumstances against which I have no longer the slightest inclination to contend, have cut me off from intimate family relations with others, and have at the same time placed at my dis. posal a large fortune. I regard these events, perhaps I should say these coincidences, as providential. They interpret to me all my earliest yearnings and aspirations, and point out their destination. From earliest infancy I have felt the profoundest sympathy with destitute children; yes, even from the age of three years, when I first noticed the difference between my own cherished and sheltered lot, and the neglected and exposed con- dition of the little beggar in the street, and wondered why such contrasts should exist, my heart, from its depths, has responded to the suffering looks or cries of the little children. As I grew older, and began to observe, and to reflect upon the many schemes of philanthropy active in the world, and see how one would aim at converting the heathen of the antipodes, another at redeeming criminals, a third at abolishing- capital punish- ment, a fourth at reforming prisons, a fifth at exterminating war, and so on forever;-and when I perceived in all these enterprises, good as they undoubtedly are, how miserably inade- quate to the cost is the return, I could but think of the nearer, and more promising field of benevolence that lay immediately around us, of thelittle, neglected children of the poor, the igno- rant, and the vicious; the little children perishing, around our very door-sills, or worse than perishing, growing up to finally become as miserable as their wretched parents. And then it seemed to me that the relief and education of destitute .children was a nearer, more urgent, and more hopeful duty, and one that, for labor and capital expended upon it, would yield a greater return in good than any other scheme of beneficence whatever. And I wondered how philanthropists, with necessarily limited means, should devote time and money to the civilizing of savages, and the reforming :of criminals, while hundreds of innocent children   NEW    L I F E.         59 around them were perishing from want, or growing up in ignorance or vice. Prevention is so much better than cure, that it seems to me bad economy, to spend upon the doubtful event of civilizing a savage, or reforming a burglar, the means that might be devoted to educating and preserving the innocence of a child." "And yet," said the pastor, mildly, "criminals are also to be pitied, and, if possible, saved. They were once innocent chil- dren-they are very often the victims of circumstances, rather than subjects of willful depravity--and should have some share in the compassion of your heart." "And they have," said Marian, gravely; " but while my power is limited, and- while one little child within my reach re- ,mains unfed, unclothed, untaught, I can give the criminal only compassion. Shall I ' take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs?'" "That is a' severe application of thetext to come from a woman's gentle lips."' "I know it is severe, but it is just and appropriate. Children have the greatest claim upon us while they have need, and we have power. Let me proceed with telling you my reasons for thinking so. CHRIST left them a perpetual legacy to us- 'Whoso shall receive one such little child in My name receiveth- Me.' Could there be a stronger or more affecting recommenda: tion of the children to our mercy? Destitute children, by their innocence, their helplessness, their suffering, and the bright or dark possibilities latent in their undeveloped natures, and in their unknown futures, appeal equally to our sympathy and our po- licy. Again, children are not, as adults are, accountable 'for their own destitution. 'They have not, as adults have, a great deal to unlearn. Their minds and hearts are like fair pages, unwritten with the annals of crime, but ready to receive tile impression of good principles. Or they are like the rich open prairie lands of America-no cutting down, rooting up, and clearing to be done-they are all ready for cultivation, and will richly repay the cultivator."   &#xD;<pb n="520-521" xml:id="VAC7871-00000253"/> 520     THE  MSSING   BRIDE. " My dear girl, have you never heard of 'juvenile depravity ?'" " There is no such thing as 'juvenile'-let me separate such words by at least a dozen others-' depravity.' Such a phrase sounds to me false, cruel, and calumnious, or would do so, were it not so contradictory as to be nonsensical. Children are never depraved.  A child's habits, received from his only guides, vicious associates, may be bad enough, but they are bad habits just as his poor little dirty jacket, and his poor little ragged trowsers are bad habits-they are not a part of him, they did not grow out of him, they are external to him, they were put upon him; he does not know where to get any better. Only provide him with clean clothes, and show him clean behaviour, and seeif he does not prefer them. But to resume the thread of my argument-Lastly, the good commenced in the intellec- tual and religious culture of children must go on forever, must produce and reproduce good fruits eternally. I do not wish to say one word against other forms of benevolence-they are all good-only this is best. It is well, if possible, to reform a cri- minal, but there, most likely, the good ends. But if you edu- cate a child, you may benefit in after times his children, and his children's children, down countless generations. There is no calculating the good that may flow on forever from one well developed human soul. This view addresses itself to our judi- cious economy in the application of means to ends, and to secure the greatest return of good from limited power of labor and money. Very early in life I felt this. In my first youth, the Lord entrusted me with but one talent-leisure-and I invested it in the teaching of poor children-and it paid a large interest -more than cent. per cent., I assure you, and the interest is still going on, and must forever go on, at compound rate. Now the'Lord has lent me two talents-time and money-and I wish to invest them in the same profitable enterprise." But we may not pause to trace minutely those labors of love in which Marian sought at once to forget her own existence and to bless that of others.   A few events only it will be necessary to record. In the very first packet of Baltimore papers received by Dr. Holmes, Marian saw announced the marriage of Angelica Le Roy, to Henry Barnwell. She knewby the date, that it took place within two weeks after she sailed from the shores of America. And her anxiety on that young lady's account was set at-rest. After a visit of two months, Dr. Holmes and his lovely wife prepared to return to the United States.  And the little for- tune that Marian intended to settle upon. Edith and Miriam, was entrusted to the care of the worthy surgeon, to be invested in bank stock for their benefit, as soon as he should reach Bal- timore. It was arranged that the donor should remain anony- mous, or be known only as a friend of Miriam's father. In the course of a few months, Marian's institution, "The Children's Home," was commenced. And before the end of the first year, it was completed and filled with inmates. Marian had at first discreetly limited the number-to be received to the capacities of accommodation afforded by her house. But could she so limit the expansion of her own benevolent heart ? Could she turn back the houseless little ones that wanted to come in ? No I never-and it happened, of course, that as month followed month, and her " Children's Home " thrived, and more applica- tions for shelter there pressed upon her, that her house had to be enlarged, and its income increased, and more and more of her reserved private fortune appropriated to meet expenses, until her whole estate was embarked in the benevolent enter- prize, and she had nothing left but a home among. her own little flock. And Marian did not regret this as long as the in- come met the outlay. But the demands of her heart, to be farther useful among the unfortunate, were not satisfied.  Her sympathies were awak- ened, and her thoughts employed for another class of sufferers -the industrious poor of the overpeopled country, starving in enforced idleness. And her mind involuntarily associated with them the vast, uninhabited, fertile tracts of land in western America. She sawf these two groups of facts, as surely re- 43*   &#xD;<pb n="522-523" xml:id="VAC7871-00000254"/> 522      TEE   MSSING   BRIDE. hated to each other as demand and supply, or as disease and remedy. The poor, miserable men and women of the old world, perishing around her for want of food, or the work that would win it--and the broad, rich prairies of the new world lying idle, waiting to repay labor and cultivation with health, compe- tence and independence to the laborer and cultivator-two things morally related, but actually separated. Day and night toiled Marian's heart and brain, with the problem of how to bring these two powers together for mutual advantage. True, she knew that there were colonization companies and emigrant ships, (as she had also known when planning for the relief o0 destitute children, that there were Orphan Asylums,) but they did not seem to meet the case. It was a doubtful good to pick up a cargo of human beings, as motely as Falstaff's regiment, made up equally of criminals and paupers, and cast them strangers and penniless upon a foreign shore-leaving them to wander about seeking work, begging or stealing, through the Atlantic cities, with not much better opportunities of improvement than they left behind. No; the great uninhabited tracts of the West-the rich prairie lands, the forests with their game, no "lord" or " gentleman" milght "preserve," the lakes and streams with their fisheries unincor-- porated ;othis was the "promised land" for the landless--the hope of the laborer I Day and night her heart burned and her head planned. Oh for the means of bringing these two related forces. together. Had she possessed the fortune of the Baron Rothschild, she would have gladly devoted it to the purpose of settling the industrious suffering poor of over-populated England upon the uninhabited rich territories of the West. She now regarded America as God's beneficent gift to the poor and oppressed of Europe. Oh! for the means of helping these poor to their land ofpromise. Day and night heart and brain worked with this problem. From herself she could do nothing; her own means were .all exhausted upon the children; she had reserved nothing--her very clothing was of that inexpensive material ninvirdia tfai +the nh;lraena 'wrrar   sNEW   LIFE.          528 But Marian knew that the most circumscribed action was better than mere fruitless theorizing, and she resolved to begin and do something, if it were for the relief of only a few families. Her acquaintance among the benevolent portion of the wealthy and influential was considerable. Her field of influence was extended and changed. She had now not only to labor for the good of others, but to labor upon the hearts and minds of others. I have before mentioned Marian's irresistible powers of persuasion-that combined elo- quence of soul and eye and lip that no one could withstand; that matchless " spell o'er hearts," -composed of beauty, genius, goodness, and indomitable will. The idea of a lady, young, beautiful, and gifted, devoting her whole life to purposes so disinterested and benevolent, could not but. appeal powerfully to the co-operation of the good, the wise, and the strong around her. She left no means untried to effect the object she had in view, and her efforts were in time rewarded with a fair prospect of success. But was Marian content? Did she realize the promised "angel's" happiness? She lived two lives-the actual life of thought and labor for others, and the inner life of sorrow; patient, silent, veiled sorrow-sorrow that she must bear alone. Thus when she suffered herself to relapse into reverie and recol. lection, her sufferings were almost insupportable; alone, un- loved, and filled with the memories of bitter wrongs, how could it be otherwise? And when, with a strong effort of will, she threw herself with all her force into works of humanity and benevolence, then--was she happy? But we must leave her for the present, and revisit Thurston.  &#xD;<pb n="524-525" xml:id="VAC7871-00000255"/> PART     FIFTH. CHAPTER   XX   I X. T H UR STON. "Who by repentance is not satisfied, Is not of Heaven nor earth."-Shakspeare. AFTER a stormy passage in life comes a long calm, preceding perhaps another storm. - I must pass rapidly over:several years. Thurston was a new being. Some Christians will tell you that the new birth is the event of a moment; others, that it is the labor of years. Doubtless both speak truly of their own experiences. In some, regeneration is a slow reform; in others, it is a sudden revolution. With Thurston it was both a violent revolution and a permanent reform. The catastrophe plucked down by his own rash hand upon the head dearest to him in life; the catastrophe that had bereaved him of his idol at the very moment and by the very means he had treacherously taken to secure her; had, ,as by a thunder-shock, roused him to a sense of what he was, what he did, and what he was fast becom- ing. His nature was revolutionized. And then ensued the wild anarchy that follows such convulsions, whether of the in- dividual soul, or of the national commonwealth; until it settles down upon a reformed basis. In the confusion that reigned in his bosom, many clamorous voices were heard ; there was bitter grief that would not be silent, but wailed forth lamentations forever; there was remorse that never slumbered, but groaned in deep self-reproaches and threats day and night. Hope tried (524)   TR HURSTON.           525 to make her voice heard, and to speak of a nearly impossible fortuity. But despair silenced her by pointing out the facts. It was after some time, and with much difficulty, that the WILL struggled up through all this anarchy, and gained the ascendency and subdued the storm, and restored quiet and order. And then, though weary and fainting with its toils, the soul saw its way clearly to its course and end. It was not to sit down supinely and indulge a fruitless sorrow and a remorse as selfish as his sin had been. It was to retrieve the past, to redeem his soul, and to labor for the good of others. And how many there were to be worked for. He resolved to devote his time, talents and means, first of all to carrying on and perfecting those works of education and reform started by Marian in his own neighborhood. But this was a very mournful consolation, for in every thought and act of the whole work, the memory of Marian was so inti- mately woven, that her loss was felt with double lkeenness. Every effort was doubly difficult; every obstacle was doubly great; every discouragement doubly hopeless, because she Was not there with her very presence inspiring hope and energy- and every success was robbed of its' joy, because she was not there to rejoice with him. He missed her in all things; he missed her everywhere. Solitude had fallen upon all the earth from which she had passed away:  Because her face was gone, all other faces were repulsive to his sight; because her voice was silent, all other voices were discordant to his ear; because her love was impossible, all other friendships and'affections were repugnant to his heart; and Thurston, young, handsome, accomplished and wealthy, became a silent and lonely man. The estate left- by old dou'desley Willcoxen had exceeded even the reports of his hoarded wealth. The whole estate, real and personal, was bequeathed to his eldest grandson, Thurston Willcoxen, upon the sole condition that it should not be divided. Dell-Delight, with its natural beauties, was a home that wealth could convert into a'material paradise.

So poignant were the wounds of association, that he could scarcely endure to remain in a neighborhood so filled with reminiscences of her; and he must have fled the scene, and taken refuge from memory in foreign travel, had he suffered from bereavement and sorrow only; but he was tortured by remorse, and remorse demands to suffer and to atone- for sin. And, therefore, though it spiritually seemed like being bound to a wheel and broken by its every turn, he was true to his resolution to remain in the county and devote his time, wealth, and abilities to the completion of Marian's unfinished works of benevolence. Dell-Delight remained unaltered. He could not bear to make it beautiful, since Marian could not enjoy its beauty. Only such changes were made as were absolutely necessary in organizing his little household. A distant relative, a middle-aged lady of exemplary piety, but of reduced fortune, was engaged to come and preside at his table, and take charge of Miriam's education, for Miriam was established at Dell-Delight. It is true that Mrs. Waugh would have wished this arrangement otherwise. She would have preferred to have the orphan girl with herself; but Commodore Waugh would not even hear of Miriam's come ing to Luckenough with any patience-"For if her mother had married Grim', none of these misfortunes would have happened," he said. Even Jacquelina had been forced to fly from Luckenough; no one knew whither; some said that she had run away; some knew that she had retired to a convent; some said only to escape the din and turmoil of the world, and find rest to her soul in a few months or years of quiet and silence, and some said she had withdrawn for the purpose of taking the vows and becoming a nun. Mrs. Waugh knew all about it, but she said nothing except to discourage inquiry upon the subject. In the   THUR4TON.           527 midst of the speculation following Jacquelina's disapperance, Cloudesley Mornington had come home. He staid a day or two at Luckenough, a week at Dell-Delight, and then took him, self, with his broken heart, off fromn the neighborhood, and got ordered upon a distant and active service.  There were also other considerations that rendered it desirable for Miriam to reside at Dell-Delight, rather than at Luckenough; Commodore Waugh would have made a terrible guardian to a child so lately used to the blessedness of a home with her mother --and withal, so shy and sensitive as to breathe freely only in an atmosphere of peace and affection, and Luckenough would have supplied a dark aid dreary home for her whose melant choly temperament and recent bereavements rendered change of scene and the companionship of other children absolute necessities. It was for these several reasons that Mrs. Waugh was forced to consent that Thurston should carry his little adopted daughter to his own home.  Thurston's household consisted now of himself, Mrs. Morris, his housekeeper, Alice Morris, her daughter, Paul Douglass, his own half-brother, poor Fanny, and lastly, Miriam. Mrs. Morris was a lady of good family, but decayed fortune, of sober years and exemplary piety. In closing her terms with Mr. Willcoxen her one great stipulation hbd been that she should bring her daughter, whom"she declared to be too "y9nng and giddy'" to be trusted out of her own sight, eveT to a good boarding school.  Mr. Willcoxen expressed himself rather pleased than other- wise at the prospect of Miriam's having a companion, and so the engagement was closed. Alice Morris was a hearty, cordial, blooming hoyden, really about ten or eleven years of age, but seeming from her fine growth and proportions at least thirteen or fourteen.  Paul Douglass was a fine, handsome, well-grown boy of foue teen, with an open, manly forehead, shaded with elustering,  yellow curls, as soft and silky a , girl's, and a full, beaing,  merry, blue eye, whse flashing glances were the mostr mith;  - -.i  &#xD;<pb n="528-529" xml:id="VAC7871-00000257"/> THJE  MSSING   BRID E. provoking to all upon whom they chanced to light. Paul was, and ever since his first arrival in the house had been, "the life of the family." His merry laugh and shout were the pleasantest sounds in all the precincts of Dell-Delight. When Paul first heard that there was to be an invasion of "women and girls" into Dell-Delight, he declared he had rather there had been an irruption of the Goths and Vandals at once-for if there were any folks he could not get along with, they were "the gals." Besides which, he was sure now to have the coldest seat around the fire, the darkest place at the table, the backward ride in the carriage, and to get the necks of chickens and the tails of fishes for his share of the dinner. Boys were always put u)on by the girls, and sorry enough he was, he said, that any were coming to the house. And he vowed a boyish vow-" by thunder and lightning"-that he would torment the girls to the very best of his ability. Girls forsooth I girls coming to live there day and night, and eat, and drink, and sleep, and sit, and sew, and walk up and down through the halls, and parlors, and chambers of Dell- Delight-girls, with their airs, and affectations, and pretensions, and exactions-girls-pah! the idea was perfectly disgusting and offensive. He really did wonder at "Brother," but then he already considered "Brother" something of an old bachelor, and old bachelors would be queer, But Thurston well knew how to smite the rock, and open the fountain of sympathy in the lad's heart. Hesaid nothing in reply to the boy's saucy objections, but on the evening that little Miriam arrived, he beckoned Paul into the parlor where the child sat, alone, and pointing her out to him, said in a low tone, "Look at her, she has lost all her friends-she has just come from her mother's grave--she is strange, and sad, and lonesome. Go, try to amuse her." "I don't know how," said Paul. "Go show her your books, or your engravings, or minerals, or dried beetles or whateveri may be the present hobby or en- thusiasm."   "She is a queer one. She is all black and white-black dress, curls, eyes, and eyebrows, and white face, hands, and neck  I say, brother, she is a sketch in Indian ink, with less light than shadow about her." "You're a babbling boy--but go and talk to her." "I say, brother, she is like Melrose Abbey by moonlight- 'all framed of ebon and ivory,' and just as picturesque and solemn, too," "You are an unfeeling boy, I am afraid. Don't you know that it is grief that makes her look so pale? She is just an orphan." "I'm going to her, though I hardly know how," replied the lad, moving toward the spot where the abstracted child sat deeply musing.  "Miriam I Is that your name," he asked, by way of opening the conversation. "Yes," replied the child, very softly and shyly. "It's a very heathenish-oh, Lord!-I mean it's a very pretty name is Miriam, it's a Bible name, too. I don't know but what it's a saint's name -also." The little girl made no reply, and the boy felt at a loss what to say next. After fidgeting from one foot to the other he began again. "Miriam, shall I show you my books-Scott's poems, and the Waverley novels, and Milton's Paradise, and-" "No, I thank you," interrupted the girl, uneasily. "Well, would you like to see my pictures-two volumes of engravings, and a portfolio full of sketches?" "No, thank you." "Shall I bring you my drawer full of minerals? I have got-" I don't want them, please." "Well, then, would you like the dried bugs? I've got whole cards of them under a glass case, and-" "I don't want them either, please."

Mr. Willcoxen came up to her and took her hand gently, and spoke kindly, saying, "What is the matter my child?" "This boy wont go away and let me alone," wept Miriam. "'Boy,1 humph-l" said Paul, walking off in high dudgeon. Presently he Walked back. "I say, little girl, I just want to speak one word, may I?" "Yes," whispered Miriam. "I just want to make a bargain with you. You don't like boys, I reckon?" "No," murmured Miriam. ' That's you I We shall agree first rate, for neither do I like girls. I hate them like anything-so now for a bargain, if you will let me alone and never speak to me, I will let you alone and never speak to you. Come I will you agree?" "Yes," said Miriam. "That's right. I;:ddn't think you'll trouble me so much after all. I don't care if I give you a ride on my pony to-morrow. Say! would you like to ride on my pony?" "No, thank you." "I've got a canoe, then. I'll give you a tide in the canoe to-morrow"-Would you like that-?" "No I shouldn't." "Well what would you like? Can't I do anything for you?" "Yes, you can go-away and leave me alone. You promised to, and now you wont." "Am I doing you any harm.-.aint I trying to please you?" "No-you promised not to speak to me, and you keep on doing so." Once more Paul walked off indignantly, but looking over his: shoulder at the little shrinking, cowering fort, he said to him- self, "Poor little shy creature, he is just for all the world like that little wounded blackbird that I found and tried to save, but that fluttered away from me every time I touched it," then turn- ing back, he said to her, Miriam, what makes you hate boys so i'   HURSTON.           681 "We didn't have any boys at home," said the chid, Shinink- ing more into herself. And Paul, seeing that his efforts at entertaining only dis. tressed her, walked away. And after that Paul took her out of the offensive class of " gls," and called her the poor little wounded "blackbird," and wond'ered how he should ever be able to serve, without alarming her. Miriam continued very shyj showing no more disposition to associate with Mrs. Morris or Alice, than with Paul-and de- lighting only in the company of Aunt Jenny, who had attend4 her from Old Fields. The next day fortune favored Paul in his efforts to please Miriam. He had a tame white rabbit, and he thought that the child would like it for a pet--so; he got up very early in the morning, and washed the rabbit "clean as a-new penny," and put it under a new box to get dry while he rode to C and bought a blue ribbon to tie around its neck. This jaunt made Paul very late at breakfast, but he felt rewarded when after- wards he gave the rabbit to old Jenny, and asked her to give it to the little girl-and when he heard the latter say--"Oh, what a pretty little thing I tell Paul, thanky!" After this; by slow degrees, he was enabled to approach "the little blackbird" without alarming her. And-after a while he coaxed her to  take a-row in his little boat, and a ride on his little pony-al- ways qualifying his attentions by saying that he did 6ot like girls as a general thing, but that The was different from others. And Mr. Willcoxen witnessed, with much satisfaction, the grow-  ing friendship between the girl and boy, for they were the two creatures in the world Who divided all the interest he felt in  life. The mutual effect of the children upon each other's cha- racters was very beneficent; the gay and joyous spirits of Paul continually charmed Miriam away from those fits of melancholy, - to which she was by temperament and circumstances a prey,  while the little girl's shyness and timidity. taght Pauli to tame his own boisterous manners for her sake. But of all the family Miriat was amost attracted to the lon6ly  &#xD;<pb n="532-533" xml:id="VAC7871-00000259"/> 532     THE   MSSING    BRIDE. sorrowful man who passed so many hours shut up in his study. A certain sympathy put the child en-rapport with the recluse. She. felt that he was suffering, and longed for the ability to comfort him. Often she resolved in her mind the proiblem of how she should be able to serve or console him. Not the least obstacle was her shyness and timidity, her self-distrust-for what could a little girl do? But the heart is a good teacher. There was a sitting-room with front windows commanding a view of the vista opening to the bay; this room was slightly repaired and furnished, just sufficiently to make it neat and comfortable; and it was usually occupied by Mrs. Morris and the two girls. There was an old-fashioned centre work-table, called a " s:ociable," with four drawers around it tending to a common centre, like spokes in a wheel, and around this table they would gather with their books or needle-work. Paul, when he became somewhat reconciled to the girls, claimed the fourth drawer and the vacant seat at the table. This drawer of Paul's was a source of great diversion to Alice Mor- ris, who called it a meptal thermometer, by which she could always tell the state of the boy's mind. And many were the fluctuations it recorded, and it was a laughable mystery to his friends, whether he meant finally to distinguish himself in art, science, belled lettres, poetry or mechanics. One month geo- logy would reign supreme, and Paul's drawer would be filled with minerals; next, accident would direct his attention to art, and the minerals would all be hustled away in a corner of the closet, and the drawer filled with engravings and pencil sketches, to be discarded in their turn to make room for dried bugs and impaled worms, to remain so long as natural history held the ascendency. His next frenzy was for carving, and the bugs and butterflies were turned out to give place to cedar blocks, and slabs, and penknives, and designs for inkstands and work-boxes and minia- ture cathedrals, and panels for ornamental book-cases that were never destined to completion. -This was a sore trial to a tidy woman like Mrs. Morris, as Paul, in his zeal for carving, sur,   THURSTON.            533 rounded himself for many feet in circumference with chips and shavings; and the governess would not have borne it long, had not little Miriam, perceiving her annoyance, quietly slipped down and gathered up the litter whenever it was made. In reward for which services Paul generously made the child a present of every piece of carving that he had spoiled. But heavy as the dispensation of carving was felt to be, they had good reason to wish the reign of chips and shavings back again, when bne evening Paul returned from the village,'bring- ing with him a cracked flute, bought at second-hand, 'and a book of instructions, to teach himself to play upon it, and there fol- lowed a visitation of horrible discords that Paul called music. This nearly drove the quiet circle crazy, for Paul had no ear for tune, and not the slightest conception of variation in sound, except as it made more or less noise, and to himr-" fa, so, la,)" stood for loud! louder! loudestl!t he ever thought that he who had the best lungs, or made the most noise, was the great- est performer. And sometimes I have suspected an opera troupe of being under the same hallucination. Be that as it may, if poor Paul ever Heard in his soul the music Of wonderful melodies- he never succeeded in giving it utterance, but instead, awoke : such discords of dreadful sounds as can only be imagined to  i exist in the future place of punishment for wicked musicians.  Conversation was difficult, and study impossible. And the amateur would have been ordered off, onlv-where was he to go? As he himself argued with a very ill-used air, he "could not go in the kitchen to play, for, if ladies had no taste for melody, it wasn't to be expected that niggers would have; nor they hadn't either, for when he sat down there to play for them, they all went away but the cook, who was dressing the dinner, - and she said it deafened her and made her head ache. And as for brother, he dare not go into his study and toot, for he  wouldn't stand it a minute." Where was he to practice, sure e enough? So they bore the inflictioo asmerrily as they could, "*                          I r        "1  &#xD;<pb n="534-535" xml:id="VAC7871-00000260"/> THE  MSSING   BRIDE.  repaying the debt by many a jest at the performer's expense, and longing for the good weather to come, when Paul might take his flute abroad, and "toot" to the "hills and fields and streams," in true pastoral style. Sometimes Mr. Willcoxen would come into the sitting-room. And in a moment Paul would stop blowing, put his flute into the drawer and shut it up. But Miriam would slip quietly from her chair, and leave it vacant for the new comer. And Mr. Willcoxen would take it without even perceiving whose attention had left it for him. And that suited Miriam best; she felt very kindly towards him, but she did not like to be noticed. As the spring opened, Mrs. Morris and her pupils became interested in the neglected flower-garden, and with the aid of a skillful gardener, they soon had it in nice order. But Miriam noticed that her mournful guardian took no in- terest in their. labor and its success. And though she glided into his study every morning in his absence, to place a vase of fragrant flowers on his table, she did not know whether her offering was welcome, or whether its presence was even per- ceived by the abstracted solitary. One day in June, however, while the child was in the garden weeding her violets, and Mr. Willcoxen was walking up and down the central walk, absorbed in deep thought, she saw him stop, stoop down, and raise a blue morning-glory in his hand. He did not pluck it, but held it gently, and gazed long and strangely down into its vase-like cup. It was the only morning-glory in the garden; its presence there was accidental. But Miriam resolved to go to her old home, where they grew abundantly, and bring some to plant: perhaps they might live if she should Water them well. She would try, anyhow, for Mr. Willcoxen, who never noticed the fine-roses and lilies and tulips and hyacinths, had studied the morning-glory. She knew, besides, that it was Marian's favo- rite flower. And, oh! at that thought came back the' rushing flood of tender memories, freighted with love and sorrow itsup-   portable, and the little girl started up and fled away into the forest, and threw herself upon her face to give way to those overwhelming bursts of sorrow that she always chose to indulge in solitude.  Mrs. Waugh had not forgotten her young protege. She came as often as possible to Dell-Delight, to inquire after the health and progress of the little girl. It is not to be supposed, in any neighborhood where there existed managing mammas and unmarried daughters, that a young gentleman, handsome, accomplished, wealthy, and-of good repute, should remain unmolested in his bachelorhood. Indeed the matrons and maidens of his own circle seemed to think themselves individually aggrieved by the young heir's mode of life. And many were the dinners and evening parties got up for his sake, in vain, for, to their infinite disgust, Thurston al- ways returned an excuse instead of an acceptance. 'At length the wounded self-esteem of the community received a healing salve, in the form of a report that Mr. Willcoxen had withdrawn from the gay world, in order the better to prepare himself for the Christian ministry. A report that, in twelve months, received its confirmation in the well established fact, that Thurston Willcoxen was a candidate for holy orders. And in the meantime the young guardian did not neglect his youthful charge, but in strict interpretation of his assumed du- ties of guardianship, he had taken'the education of the girl and boy under his own personal charge. "Many hard-working ministers of the Gospel have received pupils to educate for hire. Why may not I, with more timeat my command, reserve the privilege of educating my own adopted son and daughter," he said, and acting/ upon that thought, had fitted up a little schoolroom adjoining his library, where, in the presence of Mrs. Morris, Miriam and Paul pursued their studies, Mrs. Morris hearing such recitations as lay within her province, and Mr. Willcoxen attending to the classical and mathematical branched. Thus passed many months, anid every month the hearts &#xD;<pb n="536-537" xml:id="VAC7871-00000261"/> of the children were knitted closer to each other and to their guardian. And Thurston Willcoxen " grew in favor, with God and man." His name became the synonym for integrity, probity and philan- thropy. He built a church and a free-school, and supported both at his own expense. In the third year after entering upon his inheritance, he was received into holy orders; and two years after, he was elected pastor of his native parish. Thus time went by, and brought at length the next eventful epoch of our domestic history-that upon which Miriam completed her sixteenth year.  CHAPTER XL. MRIAM. "Her cheek too quickly flushes; o'er her eye The lights and shadows come and go too fast. The tears gush forth too soon, and in her voice Are sounds of tenderness too passionate For peace on earth."-Mrs. Hemans. Six years had passed away. Thurston Willcoxen was the most beloved and honored man, as well as the most distinguished clergyman of his day and state. His church was always crowded, except when he changed with some brother minister, whose pulpit was within reach-in which case, a great portion of his congregation followed him. Many flattering "calls" had the gifted and eloquent country parson received to metropolitan parishes; but he remained the faithful shepherd of his own flock as long as they would hear his voice. Thurston was young, healthful, and handsome; wealthy, talented, honored, and prosperous-what was wanted to com- plete his happiness? What, alas I Time, that soothes all other sorrows to sleep, has no opiate for remorse; Time, that had brought him wealth, fame, and love, brought him no peace.   I    r   MRIAM.   537   The church, the school, and the asylum he had established, flourished well; yet he could not but feel acutely that had Ma, rian's loving heart and clear head assisted him in their govern- ment and direction, they would have prospered better. Through all his nature he missed the twinf woman-soul, and there was none to take her place-none I There were good and beautiful girls around him, and they were not indifferent t;o the many attractions of the young clergyman. His genius, his goodness, his eloquence, and a certain touching beauty and grace of look and tono and manner drew all hearts to himself. More than one maiden secretly worshiped the minister,-love came to him undesired, as fame came unsought. He had known Marian, his ideal woman, and even had his bitter sorrow for her supposed death been free from remorse, her memory still had rendered the charms of all other women powerless to win her place in his heart. He had seen Marian, and though years had passed, time and distance seemed only to idealize and hallow and glo- rify her image until her excellence appeared little less than angelic. And thus, as year after year rolled on, he became more and j more of a lonely, abstracted, and sorrowing man-shunning society, except when duty called him out. Little did they know, who wondered at his genius and eloquence, that wisdom had entered by the sorrow that had "touched his lips with fire." Little did they think who wondered at his perfect knowledge of the human heart, how it was by breaking his own, that he had found out all its secret mechanism-by letting the tempest sweep the bosom's harp, he had found out -all the chords, and "knew their every tone." The honor of men, the love of dreaming girls, the admiration of all, was his dower already, and he would have been blessed with the beautiful friendship of woman, too, but for the want of that nearest and dearest wo- man-that second self-that twin soul, Marian I Had she been with him, then had he been in harmony with all outer cirles of social life and love. Then had there .been no poetic maidens dreaming vain dreams of him, and eliciting no responsei savi  &#xD;<pb n="538-539" xml:id="VAC7871-00000262"/> I-38     THE  MSSING   BRIDE. that of a faint surprise and pity soon forgotten. Then had the friendship and admiration of women been congenial so his na- ture--added larger life to his life; now something was wanted between himself and them-it was woman's soul-the wife's soul united to his own to make all outer circles of affection har- monious and beautiful and beneficial. And thus it was, repuls- ing man's sympathy and woman's friendship, the lonely heart shrank more and more into itself. With the exception of two days in the week, namely, Sundays when he preached, and Wednesdays set apart for parochial visits, he usually passed his morningsin his study, and his after- noons in rambling through the forest or on the beach. Of all the world, perhaps his affections only moved towards Paul and Miriam; but even in these relations there was some- thing wanting;--he was not en rapport with either of the young people, a chill atmosphere of distrust, felt, not under- stood, still less expressed, seemed to envelop him, and repel them. Miriam, as she bloomed into womanhood, more than fulfilled the rich promise of beauty given by her infancy. She was one of those strange visions of beauty that sometimes surprise the  beholder, and vanish, to leave behind a haunting, dream to the half-delighted, half-incredulous memory. Her form and face were of the eastern type-a slight, elegant, lithe figure; swift, smooth, graceful motions; a liquid, low-toned voice; a thin, dark, piquant face; features sharply defined, yet softly and de- licately finished; rich olive complexion, deepening and bright- ening into ripe bloom upon the cheeks and lips ;-large liquid eyes, dark, fathomless, and splendid as Syrian midnight skies, hair of that burning blue black hue, tempered in torrid zones; which dropped in countless little spiral ringlets, crisp as grape tendrils, and glittering like jet down her temples, cheeks, and throat, just reaching and dancing lightly on the graceful neck. Miriam liked dark brilliant colors, and her usual dress was black or crimson, except at midsummer, when she wore only white, l  Qr favorite flower was the crimson cypress vine-and at all , wurpvn a4a                     l   I   mI I IAMO   ^539   the summer festivals its fiery stars wreathed her head, and glowed amid the glittering tendrils of black hair. Her young companions wondered at her preference, and whispered that it was the blood-stained flower of death. But Miriam had never heard, or never heeded the superstition. Of all the seasons of the year she loved the midsummer best, and of all hours she enjoyed most the starlit midnight, when all the earth was still- and in all the heavens there was neither-moon nor cloud, nothing IL abut the clear unfathomable sky, and its myriads of intensely brilliant stars. All her tastes were governed by the same char- acteristics of mind. In music she cared nothing for simple melodies and familiar household songs, dear to most hearts, but sacred anthems or high heroic martial strains had power to catch and wrap her soul in a sort of ecstatic enthusiasm. She had few books, and fewer favorites among them. Of poetry, Shakspeare's tragedies and historical plays, Milton's Paradise Lost, and Scott's metrical romances, were her preferences. Notwithstanding her earnest and impassioned temperament, and, perhaps, because of it, Miriam was profoundly happy. She drew deep drafts of joy from the face of nature around her, from books, from painting, from music, from the affections of her heart, and from her sympathy with all that is high and heroic in human nature and human history. She had not ceased to remeiber and to love her mother and fi  Marian; but the image presented. by memory was one of holy keauty--glorified saints, angels before the throne of God.-so she thought of them. The recollection of the vow by which she bound her soul, gave no painful anxiety, but a strange and fascinating interest to her future life. In her childhood, Miriam had been too shy to speak to any one of her strange vow, and as she grew to womanhood, pru dence held her silent upon the subject, while she kept her facul- ties ever upon the alert for the discovery of some clue that might eventually lead to the detection of the guilty. She careflly preserved in memory, and often recalled to t ,  &#xD;<pb n="540-541" xml:id="VAC7871-00000263"/> ;40     THE  MSSING   BRIDE. mind the slight indexes that she already had in possession-. namely, beginning with Marian's return after her visit to Wash- ington-her changed manner, her fits of reverie, her melancholy when she returned empty-handed from the post-office, her joy when she received letters, which she would read in secret and in silence, or when questioned concerning them, would gently but firmly decline to tell from whom or whence they came; the house-warming at Luckenough, where Marian suddenly be- came so bright and gay, and the evening succeeding, when she returned home through night and storm, and in such anguish of mind, that she wept all night; and the weeks of unexplained, unaccountable distress that followed this All these things Miriam recalled, and studied if by any means they might direct her in the discovery of the guilty. And her faithful study had eventuated in her assurance of one or two facts--or one or two links, perhaps we should say, in the chain of evidence. The first was, that Marian's mysterious lover had been present in the neighborhood, and, perhaps, in the mansion at the time of the house-warming at Luckenough-that he had met her once or more, and that his name was not Thomas Truman-that the latter was an assumed name, for, with all her observation and astute investigation, she had not been able to find that any one of the name of Truman had ever been seen or heard of in the county. She was sure, also, that she had seen the man twice, both times in night and storm, when she had wandered forth in search of Marian. She remembered well the strange figure of that man-the tall form shrouded in the black cloak-the hat drawn over the eyes-the faint spectral gleam of the clear-cut profile--the pe- culiar fall of light and shade, the decided individuality of air and gait-all was distinct as a picture in her memory, and she felt sure that she would be able to identify that man again. Up to this time, the thought of her secret vow, and her life's mission, had afforded only a romantic and heroic excitement; but the day was fast approaching when these indexes she re-   MRIAM.   541   tained, should point to a clue that should lead through a triain of damning circumstantial evidence destined to test her soul by an unexampled trial. Paul Douglass had grown up to be a tall and handsome youth, of a very noble, frank, attractive countenance and mane ners. To say that he loved Miriam is only to say that he loved himself. She mingled with every thought, and feeling, and purpose of his heart. He could not bear the idea of a separate interest, far less of a 'separate existence from hers. He had cured himself of his habit of flirting with the muses, in turn, and had devoted himself td that god or goddess that presides over the art of healing; in other words, he had given up dilet- tanteism with the polite arts; frankly confessing that when he had made one line of verse, he never could get anotherto mtch it, and as for music, he did not know "Auld Lang Syne" from "Old Hundred," unless the singers would tell him; a fault that might have been as much with the musicians as with honest Paul's ear; and he had commenced and was diligently pursuing the study of medicine. Miriam bad wished him to enter the army. "But no," 'said canny Scottish Paul; "I grant you that both are very attractive, but Miriam, I will be a doctor,--and save men, instead of destroying them. And I tell you, Miriam, that I think the man that mends bones for a living quite as good a fellow as- he who breaks them for the same purpose; and a faithful physician, in the time of pesti- lence, is a greater hero than all the plumed and gilded, sword and buckler butchers that ever killed, on sea or land, for pa- triotism, passion, pay, or plunder, from the time of Cain, when one brother rose up against the other, and slew him, to this time, when thousands of' brethren rise up against other thou. sands, and slay them'. But Miriam's youthful heart was impressed with a passion for glory, without well understanding in what it consisted---she was inspired by pageantry, splendor, and martial music; and she argued the point with Paul, telling him that had it not been for those very "sword and buckler butchers" who bore the  &#xD;<pb n="542-543" xml:id="VAC7871-00000264"/> "2     THE   MSSING   BRIDE. o ok .of battle in troublous times, and whose exposure abroad $il] secured our safety at home, the quiet citizen could not pursue his avocations in peace, nor would he, Paul, be sitting there " under his own vine and. fig tree," delivering the oracles of unripe wisdom. Paul would laugh, and reply that the glitter of the uniform dazzled her judgment. And so the controversy would end, or go on, as it might chance; the two young people never loving each other better than when they honestly differed, and frankly expressed their difference. And as for the youth, the very hours given to study were almost grudged, because they took him from the girl's society. And when, at last; the time came that Paul had to leave home for Baltimore, to remain absent all winter, for the purpose of attending the course of lectures at the medical college, Miriam learned the pain of parting, and understood how impossible happiness would be for her, with Paul away,on naval or mili- tary duty, more than half their lives, and for periods of two, three, or five years; and after that she never said another word in favor of his wearing Uncle Sam's livery. Miriam's affection for Paul was so profound and quiet, that she did not know its depth or strength. As she had not be- lieved that parting from him would be painful until the event had taught her, so even now she did not know how intertwined with every chord and fibre of her heart, and how identical with her life, was her love of Paul. She was occupied by a more en thusiastic devotion to her "brother," a she called hei guardian. The mysterious sorrow, the incurable melancholy of a man like Thurston Willc'xen, could not but invest him with peculiar interest and even strange fascination for one of Xiriam's en- thsiaistic, earnest temperament. She loved him with more thaqn a daughter's love--she loved him with all the impassioned earnestness of her natur--.her heart yearned as it would break with its wild, intense longing to do him some good, to cure his sorrow,.to make him happy. There were moments when,   DAB,AM    ANPD  VISION'S.,     543 but for the sweet shyness that is ever the attendant and con- servator of such pure feeling, this wild desire was strong enough to cast her at his feet, to embrace his knees, and with tears be- seech him to let her into that dark, sorrowful bosom, to see if she could make any light and joy there. She feared that he had sinned, that his incurable sorrow was the gnawing tooth ol that worm that never dieth, preying on his heart; but she doubted, too, for what could he have done to plunge his soul in such a hell of remorse? le commit a crime? Impossible I the thought was treason; a sin to be repented of and expiated. His'fame was fairest of the fair, his name most honored among the honorable. If not remorse, what then was the nature of his life-long sorrow? Many, many times she revolved this question in her mind. And as she matured in thought and affection, the question grew more earnest and importunate. Oh that he would unburthen his heart to her; oh I that she might share and alleviate his griefs. If "' all earnest desires are prayers," then prayer was Miriam's "vital breath gad native air" indeed; her soul earnestly desired, prayed, to be able to give her sorrowing brother, peace. CHAPTER XL.

The house at Dell-Delight was very sad and lonely. The family consisted of only Thurston, Fanny and Miriam. The spring was coming on. That season, which, from its as- sociations, always aggravated the mental distress of Mr. Will- coxen, now oppressed him with unusual sadness, and day after day he immured himself in his study. A change had also passed over poor Fanny's malady. She was no longer the quaint, fantastical creature, half-lunatic, half- seeress, singing snatches of wild songs through the house-now here, nohereere, now everywhere, awaking smiles and merri- ment in spite of pity, and keeping every one alive about her. Her bodily health had failed, her animal spirits departed; she never sang nor smiled, but sat all day in her eyrie chamber, lost in deep and concentrated study, her face having the care- worn look of one striving to recall the past, to gather up and reunite the broken links of thought, memory and understanding. Yes I the house was very sad and lonely; the material atmos- phere was overcast, chill and. gloomy; the spiritual atmosphere still, heavy, oppressed, as foreboding an approaching storm. Perhaps it was these combined causes that made Miriam peculiarly sensitive to the grief that was weighing upon the spirits of her guardian. Long days and long evenings she sat alone at her work table, in the old parlor, brooding over the cause of his wretchedness. At last, one day, she received a letter from Paul, announcing the termination of the winter's course of lectures, the conclu- sion of the examination of medical candidates, the successful issue of his own trial, in the acquisition of his diploma, and finally his speedy return home.  Miriam's impulsive nature rebounded from all depressing thoughts, and she looked forward with gladness to the arrival of Paul. He came towards the last of the week.    DREAMS   AND  VISIONS.      545 Mr. Willcoxen, roused for a moment from his sad abstraction, gave the youth a warm welcome.   - Miriam received him with a bashful blushing joy. He had passed through Washington City on his way home, and had spent a day with Mrs. Morris and her friends, and he had brought away strange news of them. Alice, he said, had an accepted suitor, and would probably be a bride soon. A few days after Paul's return, he sought a private interview with his brother. He found Mr. Willcoxen in his study, wrapped in dark sorrow as in a garment. "How can a man endure such a life year after year? thought Paul. But the errand that he had come upon soon engaged his at- tention. He spoke to his brother, and at the friendly bidding of the latter, he sat down, and then, after much hesitation, managed to make known his wish to marry Miriam. "You have addressed her upon this subject?" said Mr. Willcoxen. "No, sir-not literally--no words have passed between us, but we could not fail to know each other's hearts. I love her, sir, and I am sure she-" Paul arrested himself; he was too modest and respectful to finish his sentence. "You mean to say that you are sure she would not be indif- ferent to your suit. I am glad to believe it, Paul." And the melancholy recluse smiled for the first time in many years. "Then I have your consent to mention this to Miriam?" "Yes, Paul. When do you wish this affair to come off?" "If I have a distinct explanation with Miriam," said practi- cal Paul, I think I could better bear the inevitable delay. But I do not wish-it to be prolonged beyond the time when I shall secure a good practice in this neighborhood." "And that would be a long time, Paul. Paul, you know it is written that the course of true love never did run smooth,' 45*   &#xD;<pb n="546-547" xml:id="VAC7871-00000266"/> 546     TH E  Mi SS IfG  t  DE.  and, Paul, though a poet wrote it, it is sober, prosy, daily truth, as far as my observation informs me. But, my dear boy, there are very few rules without exceptions, and yours and Miriam's true love shall be the exception to this quoted rule-- its course shall run smooth if I have power to remove obstruc tions-and I think I have. There is no absolute necessity, my dear Paul, that you should wait to marry until you can secure a professional practice here. That time, with even your best efforts, will be distant and uncertain. Miriam will be seven- teen in May. Win her consent, wait a year longer until she shall be eighteen, and then marry het, if you please. 'All that  I have is yoirs and hers. I have no dearer earthly wish than to witness your happiness, and I shall thank God that thete re- mains to me this joy of hastening its completion." This was said with a smile intended to be cheerful and et-  oatraging, but which was, in sober truth, so sad that the sight  of it, together with the thought of his brother's generosity,  brought the tears rushing to Paul's eyes, and he regarded him with mournful earnestness. "Go,; boy--go!" said Thurston, in a gentle tone. "Go, andc if you wish to give me a pleasurable feeling, win Miriam's consent to be your bride, and let me know when you are be- trothed!"  Paul went to him once more, took and pressed his hand, and then left the study, and went to seek Miriam. He found her in the old wainscoted parlor seated by the fire. She appeared to be in deep and painful thought. Her elbow rested on the circular work-table, her head was bowed upon her hand, and her face was concealed by the drooping black ringlets. "What is the matter, dear sister?" he asked, in that tender, familiar tone, with which he sometimes spoke to her. "Oh, Paul, I am thinking of our brother I Can nothing soothe or cheer him, Paul? Can nothing help him? Can we i do him no good at all? Oh, Paul I I brood so much over his trubl el-I long so mttch to comfort him, that I do believe it   DREAMS   AND  VISIONS.      54T   is beginning to affect my reason, and make me 'see visioiis aind dream dreams.' Tell tne-do you think anything can be ddoe for him?" "Ah, I do not know! I have just left hit study, deai Miriam, where I have had a long and serious conversation wtltt him." And what was it about? May I know?" "You must know, dearest Miriam, it concerned yourself aii -me!" said Paul, and he took a seat by her side, anid coi6:- mnenced and told her all that had passed during his interviie with Thurston in the library. Miriam replied, "Paul, there is one secret that I have never imipatted to you--not that I wished to keep it from you, but that notMhig has occurred to call it out-." She paused, while Paul regarded her in much curiosity. "What is it, Miriam?" he at last inquired. "I promised my dying mother, and sealed the potmise witli an oath, never to be a bride until I shall have been-- "What, Miriam?" "An avenger of blood!" "MtRIAM!" It was all he said, and then hke refained gazing at her, as if he doubted her perfect sanity. "I am not mad, dear Paul, though you 16ok as if 'you thought so." "Explain yourself, dear Miriam."         - "I am going to do so. You remember Marian Mayfieid "' she said, her face beginning to quiver with emotion. "YesI yes well?" "You remember the time and mainer of hEe death?" "Yes-yes!" "Oh! Paul, that stormy night death fell like s'eatterin g lightning, and struck three places at oncel Bat, oh!'

Child as I then was, Paul, I think it was the tre. mendous shock of her sudden and dreadful death, that threw 'me entirely out of my centre, so that I have been erratic ever since. She was more than a mother to me, Paul; and if I had been born hers, I could not have loved her better-I loved her beyond all things in life. In my dispassionate, reflective mo- ments, I am inclined to believe that I have never been quite right since the loss of Marian. Not but that I am reconciled to it-knowing that she must be happy-only, Paul, I often feel that something is wrong here and here," said Miriam, placing her hand upon her forehead and upon her heart. "But your promise, Miriam--your promise," questioned Paul, with increased anxiety. "Aye truel Well, Paul, I promised to devote my whole life to the pursuit and apprehension of her murderer; and never to give room in my bosom to any thought of love or marriage, until that murderer should hang from a gallows; and I sealed that promise with a solemn oath." "That was all very strange, dear Miriam " "Paul, yes it was-and it weighs upon mellike lead. Paul, if two things could be lifted off my heart, I should be happy. I should be happy as a freed bird." "And what are they, dear Miriam? What weights are they that I have not power to lift from your heart?" "Surely you may surmise-the first is our brother's sadness that oppresses my spirits all the time; the second is the me- mory of that unaccomplished vow; so equally do these two anxieties divide my thoughts, that they seem connected-seem to be parts of the same responsibility-and I even dreamed that the one could be accomplished only with the other."' "Dearest Miriam, let me assure you, that such dreams and visions are but the effect of, your isolated life;-they come from an over-heated brain and over-strained nerves. And you must consent to throw off those self-imposed weights, and be happy arid joyous, as a young creature should,"   DREAMS    AND   VISIONS.      549 "Alas, howo can I throw them off, dear Paul?" "In this way-first for my brother's life-long sorrow, since you can neither cure nor alleviate it, turn your thoughts away from it. As for your vow, two'circumstances combine to ab- solve you from it; the first is this-that you were an irrespon- sible infant, when you were required to make it-the second is, that it is impossible to perform it; these two considerations fairly release you from its obligations. Look upon these mat- ters in this rational light, and all your dark and morbid dreams and visions will disappear; and we shall have you joyous as any young bird sure enough. And I assure you, that your cheerfulness will be one of the very best medicines for our bro- ther. Will you follow my advice?" No, no, Paul Il I cannot follow it in either instance I cannot, Paull I it is impossiblel .I cannot steel my heart, against sympathy with his sorrows, nor can I so ignore the, requirements of my solemn vow. I do not by any means think its accomplishment an impossibility, nor was it in ignorance of its nature that I made it. No, Paul I I knew what I promised, and I know that its performance is possible. Therefore I can- not feel absolved I I must accomplish my work; and you, Paul, if you love me, must help me to do it." "I would serve you with my life, Miriam, in anything rea- sonable and possible. But how can I help you?  How can  you discharge such an obligation? -:You have not even a clue!" "Yes, I have a clue, Paul." "You have?  What is it? .Why have you never spoken of it before?"  "Because of its seeming unimportance. The clue is so slight, that it would be considered none at all, by others-less interested than myself." 7            '* : -' "' What is it, then? At least allow me the privilege. f. knowing, and judging of its importance."  "I am about to do so," said Miriam, and she commened" and told him all she knew, and also all she suspected of,:. circumstances that preceded the assassination on the ea:J  &#xD;<pb n="550-551" xml:id="VAC7871-00000268"/> 50      TInE  MSSING   BXrIDE. In conclusion, she informed him of the letters in her pos- session. "Anid where are now those letters, Miriam? What are they like? What is their purport? It seems to me that they would not only give a hint, but afford direct evidence against that demoniac assassin. And it seems strange to me that they were not examined, with a view to that end."' "Pb ul, they were; but they did not point out the writer, even. There was a note among them-a note soliciting a meeting with Marian, upori the very evening, and upon the Very spot when and where the murder was committed! But  that note contains nothing to indicate the identity of its author. There are, besides, a number of foreign letters written in French, and signed 'Thomas Truman,' no French name, by-the-bye, a circumstance which leads me to believe that it must have been an assumed one." "And those French letters give no indication of the writer, either?" "I am not sufficiently acquainted with that language to read it in manuscript, which you know is mlch more difficult than print. But I presume they point to nothing definitely, for my dear mother showed them to Mr. Willcoxen, who took the greatest interest in the discovery of the murderer, and he told her that those letters afforded not the slightest clue to the per- petrator of the crime, and that whoever might have been the assassin, it certainly could not have been the author of those letters. He wished to take them with him, but mother de- clined to give them up, she thought it would be disrepect to Marian's memory to give her private correspondence up to a stranger, and so She told him. He then said that of all men, certainly, he had the least right to claim them, and so the mat- ter rested. But mother always believed they held the key to the discovery of the guilty party; and afterward she left them to me, with the charge that I should' never suffer them to pass from nmypossession until they had fulfilled their destiny of wit- nessing against the muraderef-for whatever Mr. Willcdxen   DRPWEAMS  AiXD  VISIONS,.      S might think, mother felt convinced that the writer of those letP ters and the murderer of Marian was the same person." "Tell me more about those letters." "Dear Paul, I know nothing more about them; I told you that I was not sufficiently familiar with the French language to read them." "But it is strange that you never made yourself acquainted with their contents by getting some one else tq read ithem for you." "Dear Paul, you know that I was a mere child when they first came into my possession, accompanied with the charge that I should never part with them until they had done their office. I felt bound by my promise, I was afraid of losing them, and of those persons that I could trust none knew French except our brother, and he had already pronounced them irrelevant t6 the question. Besides, for many reasons, I was shy of intrude Ing upon brother." "Does he know that you have the packet?" "I suppose he does not even know that." "I confess,' said Paul, "that if Thurston believed them to have no connection with the murder, I have so much confidence  in his excellent judgment, that I arh inclined to reverse my hasty opinion, and to think asjhe does, at least until I see the letters. I remember, too, that the universal opinion at the time was that the poor young lady had fallen a victim to some ma- rauding waterman-the most likely thing to have happened. But, to satisfy you, Miriam, if you will trust me with those let- ters, I will give them a thorough and impartial study, and then if I find no clue to the perpetrator of that diabolical deed, I hope, Miriam, that you will feel yourself free from the responsi- bility of pursuing the unknown demon-a pursuit which I con- sider worse than a wild goose chase." They were interrupted by' the entrance of the boy with the mail bag. Paul emptied the contents of it upon .the table. There were letters for Mr. Willcoxen, for Miriam, and for Paul himself.

Miriam's letter war from Alice Morris, announcing her approaching marriage with Oliver Murray, a young lawyer of Washington, and inviting and entreating Miriam to come to the city and be her bridesmaid. Paul's letters were from some of his medical classmates. By the. time they had read and dis- cussed the contents of their epistles, a servant came in to re- plenish the fire and lay the cloth for tea. When Mr. Willcoxen joined them at supper, he laid a letter on Miriam's lap, informing her that it was from Mrs. Morris, who advised them of her daughter's intended marriage, and prayed them to be present at the ceremony. Miriam repliea that she had received a communication to the same effect. "Then, my dear, we will go up to Washington and pass a few weeks, and attend this wedding, and see the inauguration of Gen.   -. You lead too lonely a life for one of your years, love. I see it affects your health and spirits. . I have been too selfish and oblivious of you, in my abstraction, dear child; but it shall be so no longer. You shall enter upon the life better suited to your age." Miriam's eyes thanked his care. For many a day Thurston had not come thus far out of himself, and his doing so now was hailed as a happy omen by the young people. Their few preparations were soon completed, and on the first of March they went to Washington City.     CHAPTER XLII DISCOVERIES. "And all too soon she sought and found, In many a tale from those around The proof of all she feared to knowt His present guilt, their future woe. All circumstance that may compel Full credence to the tale they tell; And now her tortured heart and ear Have nothing more to feel or fear." ON arriving at Washington, our party drove immediately to the Mansion House, where they had previously secured rooms. The city was full of strangers from all parts of the country; drawn together by the japproaching inauguration of one of the most popular Presidents that ever occupied'the White House. As soon as our partylmade known their arrival to their friends, they were inundated with calls and invitations. Brother clergy- men called upon Mr. Willcoxen, and pressed upon him the free-  I dom of their houses. ' Alice Morris, and Mrs. Moulton, the relative with whom she was staying, called upon Miriam, and insisted that she should go home-with them to remain until after the wedding. But these offers ou hospitality were gratefully declined by the little set, who preferred to remain together at their hotel. The whole scene of metropolitan life, in its most stirring aspect, was entirely new and highly interesting to our rustic beauty. Amusements of every description were rife.   The theatres, exhibition halls, saloons and concert rooms held out their most attractive temptations, and night after night were  i crowded with the gay votaries of fashion and of pleasure. While the churches, and lyceums, and lecture-rooms had greater  j charms for the more seriously inclined. The old and the young,   the grave and the gay, found no lack of occupation, amusement (553) qs  &#xD;<pb n="554-555" xml:id="VAC7871-00000270"/> 554      THE   MSSING   BR IDE. and instruction to suit their several tastes or varying moods. The second week of their visit, the marriage of Alice Morris and Oliver Murray came off, Miriam serving as bridesmaid, Dr. Douglass as groomsman, and Mr. Willcoxen as officiating minister. But it is not with these marriage festivities that we have to do, but with the scenes that immediately succeed them. From the time of Mr. Willcoxen's arrival in the city, he had not ceased to exercise his sacred calling. His fame had long before preceded him to the capital, and since his coming he had been frequently solicited to preach and to lecture. ' Not from love of notoriety-not from any such ill-placed vain ,glory, but from the wish to relieve some overtasked brother of the heat and burden of at least one day; and possibly by pre. senting truth in a newer and stronger light to do some good, diid Thurston Willcoxen, Sabbath after Sabbath, and evening after evening, preach in the churches or lecture before the Iy- ceum. Crowds flocked to hear him, the press spoke highly of his talents and his eloquence, the people warmly echoed the opinion, and Mr. Willcoxen, against his inclination, became the clerical celebrity of the day. But from all this unsought world-worship he turned away a weary, sickened, sorrowing man. There was but one thing in all "the world outside" that strongly interested him-it was a "still small voice," a low-toned, sweet music, keeping near the dear mother earth and her humble chil- dren, yet echoed and re-echoed from sphere to sphere-it was the name of a lady, young, lovely, accomplished and wealthy, who devoted herself, her time, her talents and her fortune, to the cause of suffering humanity. This young lady, whose beauty, goodness, wisdom, eloquence and powers of persuasion were rumored to be almost miraculous, had founded schools and asylums, and had collected by sub- scription a large amount of money, with which she was- coming to America, to select and purchase a tract of land to settle a colony of the London poor. This angel girl's name and fame   DISCOVERIES.           555 was a low, sweet echo, as I said before--never noisy, never rising high-keeping near the ground. People spoke of her in quiet places, and dropped their voices to gentle tones in mentioning her and her works. Such was the spell it exercised over them. This lady's name possessed the strangest fascina- tion for Thurston Willcoxen-he read eagerly, whatever was written of her-he listened with interest, to whatever was spoken of her. Her name I it was that of his loved and lost Marian H that in itself was a spell, but that was not the greatest charm- her character resembled that of his Marian! "How like my Marian?" would often be the language of his heart, when hearing of her deeds. "Even so would my Malian have done-had she been born to fortune-as this lady was.." The name was certainly common enough, yet the similarity of both names and natures inclined him to the opinion that this angel-woman must be some distant and more fortunate relative of his own lost Marian. He felt drawn towards the unknown lady by a strange and almost irresistible attraction-and he secretly resolved to see and know her, and pondered in his heart ways and means by which he might with propriety seek her acquaintance. While thus he lived two lives-the outer life of work and usefulness, and the inner life of thought and suffering-the young people of his party, hoping and believing him to be en- joying the honors heaped upon him, yielded themselves up to the attractions of society. Miriam spent much of her time with her friend, Alice Murray. One morning, when she called on Alice, the latter invited her visitor up into her own chamber, and seating her there, said, with a mysterious air, "Do you know, Miriam, that I have something-the strangest -,hing that ever was--that I have been wanting to tell you for three or four days, only I never got an opportunity to do so, because Oily or some one was always present? But now Olly has gone to court, and mother has gone to market, and you and I can have a cozy chat to ourselves,"  &#xD;<pb n="556-557" xml:id="VAC7871-00000271"/> 556     THE  MSSING    BR IDE. She stopped to stir the fire, and Miriam quietly waited for her to proceed. "Now, why in the world don't you ask me for my secret? I declare you take so little interest, and show so little curiosity, that it is not a bit of fun to hint a mystery to you. Do you want to hear, or don't you? I assure you it is a tremendous revelation, and it concerns you, too!" "sW t is it, then? I am anxious to hear?" "iQtlyou do begin to show a little interest; and now, to punish you, I have a great mind not to tell you; however, I will take pity upon your suspense; but first you must promise never, never, n-e-v-e-r to mention it again--will you promise?" "Yes." "Well, then, listen. Stop I get a good place to faint first, and then listen. Are you ready? One, two, three, fire. The Reverend Thurston Willcoxen is a married man "  "What l" "Mr. Thurston Willcoxen has been married for eight years past." "Pshaw!" "Mr. Willcoxen was married eight years ago, this spring, at a little Methodist chapel near the navy yard of this city, and by an old Methodist preacher, of the name of John Berry." "You are certainly mad!" "I am not mad, most noble 'doubter,' but speak the words of truth and soberness. Mr. Willcoxen was married privately, when and where I said, to a beautiful fair-haired lady, whose name heard in the ritual, was Marian. And my husband, Olly Murray, was the secret witness of that private marriage." A wild scream, that seemed to split the heart from whence it arose, broke from the lips of Miriam-springing forward, she grasped the wrist of Alice, and with her wild eyes starting, straining from their sockets, gazed into her face, crying, "Tell me I tell me I that you have jested I tell me that you have lied? Speakl speak!" "I told you the Lord's blessed truth, and Olly knows it.   DISCOVERIES.           557 : But, Miriam, for goodness sake'don't look that way--you scare me almost to death 1. And whatever you do, never let anybody iknow that I told you this; because,: if you did, Oily would be very much grieved at me; for he confided it to me as a dead secret, and bound me up to secresy, too; but I thought as it concerned you so much, it would be no harm to tell you, if you would not tell it again; and so when I was promising, I made a mental reservation in favor of yourself. And so I have told you; and now you musthn't betray me, Miriam," "It is false! all that you have told me is false I say that it is false I tell me so I speak I speak!" cried Miriam, wildly. "It is not false-it is true as Gospel, every word of it-nor is it any mistake. Because Olly saw the whole thing, and told me all about it. The way of it was, that Olly overheard them in the congressional library arranging the marriage-the genl- tleman was going to depart for Europe, and wished to secure the lady's hand before he went-and at the same time, fori:goe reason or other, he wished the marriage to be kept secret. Oilly owns that it was none of his business, but that curiosity got the upper hand of him, so he listened, and he heard them call each other ' Thurston' and ' Marian'--and when they left the library, he followed them-and so, unseen, he witnessed the private marriage ceremony, at which they still: answered to the names of' Thurston' and 'Marian.' He-did not hear their sur- names. He never saw the bride again; and he never saw the bridegroom until he saw Mr. Willcoxen at our wedding. The moment Olly saw him he knew that he had seen-him before, but could not call to mind when or where; and the oftener he looked at him, the more convinced he became that he had seen him first under some very singular circumstances. And when at last he heard his first name called ' Thurston,? the whole truth flashed on him at once. He remembered every- thing connected with the mysterious marriage.

But only deep and shuddering groans, upheaving from the' poor girl's bosom, answered her. "Miriam I Oh, don't go on so I what do you mean? Indeed, you alarm me! oh, don't take it so toheart I indeed, Iwouldn't, if I were you! I should think it the funniest kind of fun  Miriam, I say!" She answered not--she had sunk down on the floor, utterly crushed by the weight of misery that had fallen upon her. "Miriam I now what in the world do you mean by this? Why do you yield so? I would not do it I I know it is bad to be disappointed of an expected inheritance, and to find out that some one else has a greater claim, but, indeed, i would not take it to heart so, if I were you. Why, if he is married, he may not have a family, and even if he has, he may not utterly disinherit you, and even if he should, I would not grieve myself to death about it if I were you I Miriam, look up, I say!" But the hapless girl replied not, heard not, heeded not; deaf, blind, insensible was she to all-everything but to that sharp, mental grief, that seemed so like physical pain-that fierce an- guish of the breast, that, like an iron hand, seemed to clutch and close upon her heart-tighter, tighter, tighter, until it stopped the current of her blood, and arrested her breath, and threw her into convulsions. Alice sprang to raise her, then ran down stairs to procure restoratives and assistance. In the front hall she met Doctor Douglass, who had just been admitted by the waiter. To his pleasant greeting, she replied hastily, breathlessly, "Oh, Paul I come--come quickly up stairs I Miriam has fallen into convulsions, and I am frightened out of my senses!" '(,What caused her illness?" asked Paul, in alarm and anxiety, as he ran up stairs, preceded by Alice. "Oh, I don't know!"  (It could not have been what I said to her, and if it was, I must not tell,) added Alice, as she opened the door and ushered him into the chamber. The details of sickness are never interesting. I shall not dwell upon Miriam's illness of several weeks; the doctors pro-   D I S COVE RIE S.        559 hounced it to be angina pectoris-a fearful and often fatal complaint, brought on in those constitutionally predisposed to it, by any sudden shock to mind or body. What could have caused its attack upon Miriam, they could not imagine. And Alice Murray, in fear and doubt, held her tongue and kept her own counsel. In all her illness, Miriam's reason was not for a moment cloaded--it seemed preternaturally awake; but she spoke not, and it was observed that if Mr. Willcoxen, who was overwhelmed with distress by her dreadful illness, approached her bedside and touched her person, she instantly fell into spasms. In grief and dismay, Thurston's eyes asked of all around an explanation of this strange and painful phenomenon; but none could tell him, except the doctor, who pronounced it the natural effect of the excessive nervous irritability attending her disease, and urged Mr. Willcoxen to keep away from her chamber. And Thurston sadly complied.+ Youth, and an elastic constitution, prevailed over disease, and Miriam was raised from the bed of death; but so changed in person and in manner, that you would scarcely have recog- nized her. She was thinner, but not paler-an intense, con- suming fico burned in and out upon her cheek, and smoul- dered and Hushed from her eye. - Self-concentrated and re- served, she replied not at all,-or only in monosyllables, to B the words addrcssed to her, and withdrew more into herself. At length, Poctor Douglass advised their return home. And therefore th y set out, and upon the last of March, ap. proached Dell-Dclight. The sky was oiercast, the ground was covered with snow, the weather was damp, and very cold for the last of March. As evening drew on, and the lealen sky lowered, and the chill damp penetrated the comfortable carriage in which they traveled, Mr. Willcoxen redoubled his attentions to Miriam, carefully wrapping her cloak and furs about her, and letting down the leathern blinds and the damask hangings, to exclude the cold; but Miriam shrank from his touch, and shivered more than before, and-drew closely into her own corner.  &#xD;<pb n="560-561" xml:id="VAC7871-00000273"/> a60     HTHE MSSING   BRIDE. "Poor child, the cold nips and shrivels her as it does a tropical flower," said Thurston, desisting from his efforts after he had tucked a woolen shawl around her feet. "It is really very unseasonable weather-there is snow in the atmosphere. I don't wonder it pinches Miriam," said Paul Douglass. Ah! they did not either of them know that it was a spiritual fever and ague alternately burning and freezing her very heart's blood--hope and fear, love and loathing, pity and horror, that striving together made a pandemonium of her young bosom. Like a flight of fiery arrows came the coincidences of the tale she had heard, and the facts she knew. That spring, eight years before, Mr. Murray said he had, unseen, witnessed the marriage of Thurston Willcoxen and Marian. That spring, eight years before, she knew Mr. Willcoxen and Miss Mayfield had been together on a visit to the capital. Thurston had gone to Europe, Marian had returned home, but had never seemed the same since her visit to the city. The very evening of the house-warming at Luckenough, where Marian had betrayed so much emotion, Thurston had suddenly returned, and presented himself at that manison. Yet in all the months that followed, she had never seen Thurston and Marian together. Thurston -was paying marked and constant attentions to Miss Le Roy, while Marian's heart was consuming with a secret sorrow and anxiety that she refused to communicate even to Edith. How distinctly came back to her mind those nights when, lying by Marian's side, she had put her hand over upon her face and felt the tears on her cheeks. Those tears 1 the recollection of them now, and in this connection, filled her heart with inde- scribable emotion. Her mother, too, had died in the belief that Marian had fallen by the hands of her lover or her husband Lastly, upon the same night of Marian's murder, Thurston Willcoxen had been unaccountably absent, during the whole night, from the death-bed of his grandfather. And then his incurable melancholy from that day to this-his melancholy augmented to anguish at the annual return of this season.   DISC O V E  I ES.        561 And then rising, in refutation of all this evidence, was his own irreproachable life and elevated character. Ah! but she had-young as she was, heard of such cases before-how in some insanity of selfishness or frenzy of passion, a crime had been perpetrated by one previously and afterwards irreproachable in conduct. Piercing wound after wound smote  these thoughts like swift coming arrows. A young, immature woman, a girl of seventeen, in whose warm nature passion and imagination so largely predominated over intellect, was but too liable to have her reason shaken from its seat by the ordeal through which she was forced to go. As night descended, and they drew near 'Dell-Delight, the storm that had been lowering all the afternoon came upon them. The wind,the hail, and the snow, and the snow-drifts continually forming, rendered the roads, that were never very good, now nearly impassable.  More and more obstructed, difficult and unrecognizable became their way, until at last, when within an eighth of amile from the house, the horses stepped off the road into a covered gully, and the carriage was overturned and broken.  "Miriam 1 dear Miriam! dear child, are you hurt?" was the first anxious exclamation of both gentlemen. No one was injured; the coach lay upon its left side, and the right side door was over their heads. Paul climbed out first, and then gave his hand to Mai-am, whom Mr. Willcoxen  assisted up to the window. Lastly followed Thurston. Th  . horses had kicked themselves free of the carriage, and stood  kicking yet.  "Two wheels and the pole are broken-nothing can be done to remove the carriage to-night. You had better leave- the horses where they are, Paul, and let us hurry on to get Miriam i under shelter first, then we can send some one to fetch them - home." *  They were near the park gate, and the road from there to the mansion was very good. Paul was busy in bundling MiiaMw up in her cloak, hawls and furs. And then Mr. Willcoxen -    .

Little knowing her thoughts, Mr. Willcoxen slightly smiled, and pulling his hat low over his eyes, and turning up his fur collar and wrapping his cloak closely around him, he strode on rapidly before them. The snow was blowing in their faces, but drawing Miriam fondly to his side, Paul hurried after him. When they reached the park gate, Thurston was laboring to open-it against the drifted snow. He succeeded, and pushed the gate, back to let them pass. Miriam, as she went through, raised her eyes to his form. There he stood, in night and storm, his tall form shrouded in the long black cloak-the hat drawn over his eyes, the faint spectral gleam of the snow striking upward to his clear-cut pro- file, the peculiar fall of ghostly light and shade, the strong indi- viduality of air and attitude. With a half-stifled shriek, Miriam recognized the distinct picture of the man she had seen twice before with Marian. "What is the matter, love? Were you near falling? Give me your arm, Miriam-you need us both to help you through this storm," said Thurston, approaching her. But with a shiver that ran through all her frame, Miriam shrank closer to Paul, who, with affectionate pride, renewed his care; and promised that she should not slip again. So link after link of the fearful evidence wound itself around her consciousness, which struggled against it, like Laocoon in the fatal folds of the serpent. Now cold as if the blood were turned to ice in her veins- now burning as if they ran fire-she was hurried on into the house. They were expected home, and old Jenny had fires in all the occupied rooms, and supper ready to go on the table, that was prepared in the parlor.  But Miriam refused all refreshment, and hurried to her room.

"Wouldn't she have a strong cup of tea? Wouldn't she have a hot bath? Wouldn't she have her bed warmed? Wouldn't she have a bowl of nice hot mulled wine? Dear, dear I she was so sorry, but it would have frightened herself to death if the carriage had upset with her, and no wonder Miss Miriam was knocked up entirely." "No, no, no 1" Miriam would have nothing, and old Jenny reluctantly left her--to repose? Ah, no I with fever in her veins to walk up and down and up and down the floor of her room with fearful unrest. Up and down, until the candle burned low, and sunk drowned in its socket; until the fire on the hearth smouldered and went out; until the stars in the sky waned with the coming day; until the rising sun kindled all the easterrn horizon; and then, attired as she was, she sank upon the outside of her bed, and fell into a heavy sleep of exhaustion. She arose unrefre'shed, and after a hasty toilet descended to the breakfast parlor, where she knew the little family awaited her. "The journey and the fright have been too much for you, love;' you look very weary; you should have rested longer this morning," said Mr. Willcoxen affectionately, as he arose and met her, and led her to the most comfortable seat near the fire. His fine countenance, elevated, grave and gentle in expression, his kind and loving manner, smote all the tender chords of, Miriam's heart. Could that man be guilty of the crime she had dared to suspect him of?

But Miriam sprang up to anticipate him; and drew her chair to the table, and nervously began to arrange the cups and put sugar and cream into them, with the vague feeling that she must act as usual to avoid calling observation upon herself, for if ques- tioned, how could she answer inquiries, and who could she make a confidant in her terrible suspicions? And so through the breakfast scene, and so through the whole day she sought to exercise self-control. But could her distress escape the anxious, penetrating eyes of affection? That even- ing, after tea, when Mr. Willcoxen had retired to his own apart- ment, and the waiter had replenished the fire and trimmed the lamps and retired, leaving the young couple alone in the parlor --Miriam sitting on one side of the circular work-table bending over her sewing, and Paul on the other side with a book in his hand, he suddenly laid the volume down, and went round and drew a chair to Miriam's side, and began to tell her how much he loved her, how dear her happiness was to him, and to entreat her to tell him;the cause of her evident distress. As he spoke, she became paler than death, and suddenly and passionately exclaimed,                         i "Oh, Paul I Paul I do not question me!  You know not what you ask."

"My own dearest, you are ill, and need change, and you shall have it, Miriam," he said, attempting to soothe her with that gentle, tender loving manner he ever used towards her. But shuddering sighs convulsed her bosom, and, "Oh, PauliX Paul!" was all she said. "  Is it that promise that weighs upon your mind; Miriam? Cast it out; you cannot fulfill it; impossibilities are not duties.", "',Oh, Paul! would Heaven it were impossible or that I were dead." 4 *ft   DISCOVERIE S.          565 "Miriam I where are those letters you wished to show me?"

"Just get me those letters, dear Miriam," he urged gently. She arose, tottering, and left the room, and after an absence of fifteen minutes, returned with the packet in her hand. "These seals have not been broken since my mother closed them," said Miriam, as she proceeded to open the parcel. The first she came to was the bit of a note without date" or signature, making the fatal appointment. "This, Paul," she said mournfully, " was found in the pocket of the dress Marian wore at Luckenough, but changed at home before she went out to walk the evening of her death. Mother always believed that she went out to meet the appointment made in that note."        ' "Paul took the paper with eager curiosity, to examine it. He looked at it, started slightly, turned pale, shuddered, passed his hand once or twice across his eyes, as if to clear his vision, looked again, and then his cheeks blanched, his lips gradually whitened and separated, his eyes started, and his whole counte- nance betrayed consternation and horror.

They seemed afraid to look each other in the face; and well they might 'be, for the written agony on either brow; they seemed afraid to hear the sound of each other's words; and well they might be, for the hollow, unnatural sound of either voice.

I believe I have confined myself too much, and studied too hard. I am really out of sorts, never mind me please hand me those foreign letters, love." Miriam was unfolding and examining them; but all in a cold, stony, unnatural way. . "Paul," she asked, "wasn't it just eight years this spring since your brother went to Scotland to fetch you?" "Yes, why?" "Wasn't it to Glasgow that he went?" "Yes, why?" "Were not you there together in March and April, 182-?" "Once more, yes 1 why do you inquire?" '^Because all these foreign letters directed to Marian, are postmarked Glasgow, and dated March or-April, 182-" With a low, stifled cry, and a sudden spring, he snatched the packet from her hand, tore open the first letter that presented itself, and ran his strained, blood-shotten eyes down the lines. Half suppressed, deep groans like those wrung by torture. from a strong man's heart, burst from his pale lips, and great drops of sweat beaded on his agonized forehead; and then he crushed the letters together in ris hand, and held them tightly, unconsciously, while his starting eyes were fixed on vacancy,  and his frozen lips muttered, "In a fit of frantic passion, anger, jealousy, even he miht have been maddened to the pitch of doing such a thing I but aA an act of base policy, as an act of forethought, ohI never, never, never!"

"Paul I Paul!" cried Miriam, starting up, standing before him, gazing on him: "Paull speak to me. Your looks kill me. Speak, Paul I even though you can tell me little new. I know it all, Paul; or nearly all. Weeks ago I received the shock I it overwhelmed me for the time; but I survived it I but you, Paul I you Oh I how you look I Speak to your sister, Paul I Speak to your promised wife." But he gave no heed to her. She was not strong or assured -she felt herself tottering on the very verge of death or,mad- ness-but she could not bear to see him looking so-once more she essayed to engage his attention. "Give me those letters, Paul-I can perhaps make out the meaning." As he did not reply, she gently sought to take them from his hand. But at her touch he suddenly started up and threw the packet into the fire. With a quick spring Miriam darted forward, thrust -her hand into the fire, and rescued the packet, scorched and burning, but not destroyed. She began to put it out, regardless of the pain to her hands, He looked as if he were tempted to snatch it from her, but she exclaimed, "No, Paul I no I you will not use force to deprive me of this that I must guard as a sacred trust." Still Paul hesitated, and eyed the packet with a gloomy glance. "Remember honor, Paul, even in this trying moment," said Miriam; " let honor be saved, if all else be lost." "What do you mean to do with that parcel?" he asked in a hollow voice. "Keep them securely for the present." "And afterwards?" "I know not." "Miriam, you evade my questions. Will you promise me ole thing "    DISOCOVERI S.          569 What is that?" Promise me to do nothing with those letters until you have farther evidence." "I promise you that."  Then Paul took up a candle and left the room, as if to go to his sleeping-apartment; but on reaching the hall, he threw down and extinguished the light, and rushed as if for breath out into the open air. The night was keen and frosty, the cold, slaty sky was thickly studded with sparkling stars, the snow was crusted over -it was a fine, fresh, clear, wintry night-at another time it would have invigorated and inspired him-now the air seemed stifling, the scene hateful. The horrible suspicion of his brother's criminality had entered his heart for the first time, and it had come with the shock of certainty. The sudden recognition of the handwriting, the strange revelations of the foreign letters, had not only in them, selves been a terrible disclosure, but had struck the whole " elec* tric chain" of memory and association, and called up inmliving force many an incident and circumstance heretofore strange and incomprehensible; but now only too plain and indicative.

There was agony-there was madness in the pursuit of the investigation. Oh I pitying heavens, how thought and grief surged and seethed in aching heart and burning brain I And Miriam's promise to her dying mother-Miriam's pro- mise to bring the criminal to justice! would she-could she now abide by its obligations?-could she prosecute her benefactor, her adopted brother, for murder?-could her hand be raised to hurl him down from his pride of place to shame and death?

"I will myself prevent her, I will find means, arguments and persuasions to act upon her.

She will; she will; responded the, deliberate conscience. And so he walked up and down-vainly the fresh wind fanned his fevered brow-vainly the sparkling stars glanced down from holy heights upon him-he found no coolness for his fever in the air, no sedative for his anxiety in the stillness, no comfort for his soul in the heavens-he knew not whether he were in- doors or out-whether it were night or day, summer or winter   INDICTMENT.           571 -he knew not, wrapped-as he was in the mantle of his own sad thoughts, suffering as he was in the purgatory of his inner life. While Paul walked up and down, like a maniac, Miriam re- turned to her room to pace the floor until nearly morning, when she threw herself exhausted upon the bed, fell into a heavy sleep, and a third time, doubtless from nervous excitement or prostra- tion, suffered a repetition of her singular vision, and awoke late in the morning, with the words, "Perform thy vow," ringing in, her ears.

And  yet with matchless tact and discretion, she went about her deadly work. She had prepared her plan of action, and now waited only for a day very near at hand, the fourth of April, the anniversary of Marian's assassination, to put Thurston to a final test before proceeding further. The day came at last-it was cold and wintry for the season. Towards evening, the sky became overcast with leaden clouds, and the chill dampness penetrated into all the rooms of the old mansion. Poor Fanny wa muittering and moaning to herself and her "spirits" over the wood fire in her distant room. Mr. Willcoxen had not appeared since breakfast time. Mi- riam remained in her own chamber; and Paul wandered rest. lessly from place to place through all the rooms of the house, or threw himself wearily into his chair before the parlor fire. Inclement as the weather was, he would have gone forth, but that he too remembered the anniversary, and a nameless anxiety connected with Miriam confined him to the house. In the kitchen, the colored folks gathered around the fire, grumbling at. the unseasonable coldness of the weather, and predicting a hail-storm, and telling each other that they never "'sperienced" such weather this time o' year, 'cept 'twas that spring Old Marse died-when no wonder, "'siderin' how he lived long o' Sam all his life."

Night and the storm descended together-such a tempestl such a wild outhreaking of the elements I rain and hail, and snow and wind, all warring upon the earth together--the old house shook, the doors and windows rattled, the timbers cracked, the shingles were torn off and whirled aloft-the trees were swayed and snapped; and as the storm increased in violence and roused to fury, the forest beat before its might, and the waves rose and overflowed the low land.                , Still old Jenny went in and out from house to kitchen and kitchen to house, carrying wood, water, meat, bread, sauce  sweetmeats, arranging the table for supper, replenishing the fire, lighting the candles, letting down the curtains-and trying to make everything cozy and comfortable for the reassembling of the fireside circle. Poor old PJinny had passed so much of her life in the family with " the white felks," that all her sympathies went with them-and on'the state of their spiritual atmosphere depended all her cheerfulness and comfort; and now the cool, distant, sorrowful condition of the members of the little family- circle-'" ebry single mudder's son and darter ob 'em, superam, balated off to derself like pris'ners in a jail-house"-as she said-depressed her spirits very much. Jenny's reaction from depression was always querulous. And towards the height of, the storm, there was a reaction and she grew very quarrelsome. "Sam's waystin'* roun' in dere," said Jenny, as she thrust her feet into the kitchen fire, before carrying in the urn; "Sam's waystin', I tells you all good! all werry quiet dough-no noise, no fallin' out, no 'sputin' nor nothin'---all quiet as de yeth jest afore a debbilt ob a storm-nobody in de parlor 'cept 'tis Mfarse Paul, settin';right afore de parlor fire, wid one long leg poked east and toder west, wid the boots on de andirons like a spread-eagle t lookin' as glum as if I owed him a year's sarvice, an' nebber so much as a-sayin' 'Jenny, you poor old: debbilj *W atystinggoing up and down. 36  &#xD;<pb n="574-575" xml:id="VAC7871-00000280"/> 574,    TI E  M S SING   BRIDE. - aint you a-cold?' an' me coming in ebry minnit wid the icicles a-jinglin' roun' my linsey-woolsey skurts, like de diamonds on de Wirgin, Mary's Sunday gown.

"I 'members of no sich since dat same storm as de debbil come in to fetch ole marse's soul-dis berry night seven year past, an' he carried of him off all in a suddint whiff I jist like a puff of win'., An' no wonder, seeiu' how he done traded his soul to him for money!" "An' Sam's here ag'in to-night! dunno who he's come arter  but he's here, now, I tells yon all good!" said Jenny, as she took up the urn to carry into the parlor. -When she got there she could scarcely get to the fire; Paul took up the front. His immobility and unconsciousness irri- tated Jenny beyond silent endurance. "I tell you all what," she said, "I means to 'sign my sitewa- tion! 'deed me I can't kill mysef for dem as wouldn't even care 'nough for me to have a mass said for de 'pose o' my soul." "What do you mean?" asked Paul, angrily, for confinement, x solitude, bad weather, and anxiety, had combined to make him querulous too. "I means how ef yet doesn't have a kivered way made from de house to de kitchen an' back ag'in, I gwine give up ,waitin' one de table, now mine I tell yer, 'deed me I an' now ef you likes, yer may jes' go an' tell Marse Rooster."'

They came-slowly and singly-and drew around the table, more like ghosts than living persons-a few remarks upon the storm-and then they sunk into silence-and as soon as the gloomy meal was over, one by one, they dropped away from the room-first went poor Fanny, then Mr. Willcoxen, then Miriam. "Where are you going, Miriam?" asked Paul, as the latter was leaving the room.  "To my chamber," And before he could farther question, or longer detain her, she pressed his hand and went out. And Paul, with a deep sigh and a strangely foreboding heartf sank back into his seat.' When Miriam reached her bed-room, she carefully closed and locked the door, went to her bureau, opened the top-drawer, and took from it a small oblong mahogany glove-box. She unlocked the latter, and took out a small parcel, which she un- wrapped and laid before her upon the bureau. It was the xyphias poniard. The weapon had come into her possession some time before in the following manner: During the first winter of Paul Douglass's absence from home, Mrn-Willcoxen had emancipated several of his slaves and provided means for their emigration to Liberia. They were to sail early in March. Among the num- ber was Melchisedek. A few days previous to their departure, this man had come to the house, and sought the presence of his youthful mistress, when he knew her to be alone in the parlor- and with a good deal of mystery and hesitation had laid before her a dagger which he said he should rather have given to "Marster Paul," if the latter had been at home. He had picked it up near the water's edge on the sands the night of Miss Mayfield's death, which "Marster" had taken so to heart,- that he was afraid to harrow up his feelings by bringing it to *  *i,   &#xD;<pb n="576-577" xml:id="VAC7871-00000281"/> 5706    - TH E  MSSING   B  I D E. him a second time-but that as it was an article of value, he did not like to take it away with him. And he begged Miss Miriam to take charge of it. And Miriam had taken it, and with strprise, but without the slightest suspicion, had read the name of "Thurston Willcoxen" carved upon its handle. To all her questions, Melchisedek had given evasive answers, or remained obstinately silent--being determined not to betray his masterts confidence by revealing his share in the events of that fatal night. Miriam had taken the little instrument, wrapped it carefully in paper, and locked it in her old-fashioned long v glove-box. And from that day to this she had not opened it. Now, however, she had taken it out with a fixed purpose, and she stood and gazed upon it. Presently she took it up, rolled it in the paper, took her lamp, and slowly left her room, and passed along the passages leading to Mr. Willcoxen's library. The storm howled and raved as she went, and the strong blast, driving through the dilapidated window-sashes, nearly ex- tinguished her light before she reached the study door.  ! She blew out the light and set down the lamp, and rapped at the door. Again and again she rapped, without awakening any response from within. Then she turned the latch, opened the door, and entered. No wonder she had received no answer. The abstracted man before her seemed dead to every sight and sound around him. He sat before the table in the middle of the room, his elbow on the mahogany; his face bowed upon his hand, his haggard countenance revealing a still, speechless despair as awful as it was profound. Miriam approached and stood by him, her breath went by his cheek, so near she stood, and yet her presence was unheeded. She stooped to see the object upon which he gazed-the object that now shut out all the world from his, sight-it was a long bright tress of golden auburn hair. "Mr. Willcoxen!" He did not hear her-how should he hear her low tones, when. he heard not the cannonading of the storm that shook the house to its foundation?    INUDICTMENT iT          5" "Mr. Willcoxen!" she said once more. But he moved not a muscle. "Mr. Willcoxen!" she repeated, laying her hand upon his arm. He looked up. The expression of haggard despair softened- out of his countenance. "Is it you, my dear?" he said. "What has brought you here, Miriam? Were you afraid of the storm? There is no danger, dear child-it has nearly expended its force, and will soon be over-but sit down." "Oh, no I it is not the storm that has brought me here, though I scarcely remember a storm so violent at this season of the year,-except one-this night seven years ago-the night that Marian Mayfield was murdered!" iHe started--it is true that he had been thinking of the same dread tragedy-but to hear it suddenly mentioned, pierced him like an unexpected sword thrust. ? Miriam proceeded-speaking in a strange, level, monotone-- as if unwilling or afraid to trust her voice far, "I came this evening to restore a small but costly articleTof virtu, belonging to you, and left in my care some time ago, by- the, boy Melchisedek. It is an antique dagger--somewhat rusty and spotted---here it is.)' And she laid the poniard down upon the tress of hair before him. He sprang up as if it had been a viper-his whole frame shook, and the perspiration started from his livid forehead. Miriam, keeping her eye upon him, took the dagger up. "It is very rusty, and very much streaked,'; she said. "I wonder what these dark streaks can be? They run along the edge, from the extreme point of the blade,.upwards towards the handle-they look to me like'the stains of blood-as if a murderer had stabbed his victim with it, and in his haste to escape, had forgotten to wipe the blade, but: bad left the blood upon it, to curdle and corrode the steel-see I don't it look so to  you?" she said, approaching him, and holding the weapon up to his view. * a                 '   &#xD;<pb n="578-579" xml:id="VAC7871-00000282"/> 578     THE  MSSING    BRIDE. "Girl I girl what do you mean?" he exclaimed, throwing his hand across his eyes, and hurrying across the room. Miriam flung down the weapon with a force that made its mettle ring upon the floor, and hastening after him, she stood before him; her dark eyes fixed upon his, streaming with insuf- ferable and consumingfire, that seemed to burn through into ,his brain.. She said, "I have heard of fiends in the human shape, nay, I have heard of Satan in the guise of an angel of light I Are you such that stand before me now?" "Miriam, what do you mean?" he asked, in sorrowful aston- ishment. "THS is what I mean I That the mystery of Marian May- field's fate, the secret of your long remorse, is no longer hidden I I charge you with the murder of Marian Mayfield I' "Miriam, you are mad!" "Oh! well for me-and better still for you if I were mad!" He was tremendously shaken, more by the vivid memories she recalled, than by the astounding charge she made. :   ^"In the name of Heaven, what leads you to imagine such impossible guilt!" "Good knowledge of the facts-that this month, eight years ago, in the little Methodist chapel of the navy yard, in Wash- ington City, you made Marian Mayfield your wife--that this night seven -years since, in just such a storm as this, on the beach below Pine Bluff, you met and murdered Marian Willcoxcn I And, moreover, I assure you, that these facts which I tell you now, to-morrow4I -will lay before a magistrate, together with all the corroborating proof in my possesssion!"

Sit down and hear me." Miriam dropped into the inearest chair. Mr; Willcoxen took another, and commenced- "You have received some truth, Miriam. How it has been presented to you, I will not ask now. I may presently. I was married, as you have somehow ascertained, to Marian Mayfield, just before going to Europe. I corresponded with her from 'Glasgow. I did appoint a meeting with her on the beach, upon-- the fatal evening in question-for what purpose that meeting was appointed, it is bootless to tell you, since the meeting never took place-for some hours before I should have set out to keep my appointment, my grandfather was stricken with apo- ,plexy. I did not wish to leave his bedside until the arrival of the doctor. But when the evening wore on, and the storm ap- proached, I grew uneasy upon Marian's account, and sent Mel- ehisedek in the gig to fetch her from the beach to this house- never to leave it. Miriam, the boy reached the sands only to find her dying. Terrified half out of his senses, he hurried back; and told me this story. I forgot my dying relative-for- got everything, but that my wife lay wounded and exposed on :the beach. I sprung upon horseback, and galloped with all ;possible haste to the spot. By the time I had got there the storm had reached its height, and the beach was completely covered with the boiling waves. My Marian had been carried away. I spent the wretched night in wandering up and down the bluff above the beach, and calling on her name. In the morning I returned home to find my grandfather dead, and the family and physicians wondering at my strange absence at such a time. That, Miriam, is the story."  Miriam made no comment whatever. Mr. Willcoxen seemed surprised and grieved at her silence. W- hat have you now to say, Miriam?" "Nothing.  "s Nothing '-what do you think of my explanation?"

"It is my insupportable duty I it is my fatel my doom I for it will kill me!" ( Yet you will do it l" 'I will."

"OhI would Heaven that I might die, rather than do this thing I would Heaven I might die I for my heart turns to you; it turns, and I love you so-ohI I love you sol never, never so much as now I my brother! my brother!" and she sunk down, and seized his hands and wept over them. "What, Miriam I do you love me, believing me to be guilty?" "To have been guilty-not to be guilty-you have suffered remorse--you have repented, these many long and wretched years. Oh I surely repentance washes out guilt!" "And you can now caress land weep over my hands, believ- ing them to have been crimsoned with the life-stream of your first and best friend?"

With anguish bordering on insanity, she threw herself into his arms for a moment-was pressed to his heart, and then breaking away, she escaped from the room to her own chamber. And there, with her half-crazed brain and breaking heart-like one acting or forced to act in a ghastly dream, she began tom arrange her evidence-collect the letters, the list of witnesses and a ll, preparatory to setting forth upon her fatal mission in the morning. With the earliest dawn of morning, Miriam left her room. In passing the door of Mr. Willcoxen's chamber, she suddenly stopped-a spasm seized her heart, and convulsed her features -she clasped -her hands to pray, then, as if there were wild mockery in the thought, flung them fiercely apart, and hurried on her way. She felt that she was leaving the house never to return, she- thought that she should depart without encountering any of its inmates. She was surprised, therefore, to meet Paul in the front passage. He cameup and intercepted her- "Where are you going so early, Miriam?"  "To Colonel Thornton's." "What I before breakfast?" "Yes.", He took both of her hands, and looked into her face-her pallid face--with all the color concentrated in a dark crimson spot upon either cheek-with all the life burning deep down in the contracted pupils of the eyes. "Miriam, you are not well-come, go into the parlor," he said, and attemptedto draw her towards the door. "No, Paul, no I I must go out,'? she said, resisting his efforts. "But why:?" "What is it to you? Let me go." "It is everything to me, Miriam, because I suspect your er- rand.  Come into the parlor. This madness must not go on." "Well, perhaps I am mad, and my words and acts may go for 'nothing. I hope it may be so." "Miriam, I must talk with you-not here-for we are liable to be interrupted every instant. Come into the parlor, at least or a few moments."   I N DI C T M E' N T.       583 She no longer resisted that slight plea, but suffered him to lead her in. He gave her a seat, and took one beside her, andd tookl her hand in his, and bed to urge her to give up her fatal purpose. He appealed Other, through reason, through religion, through all the strongest passions and affections of her soul-through her devotion to her guardian-through the gra. titude she owed him--through their mutual love, that must be sacrificed, if her insane purpose should be carried out. To- all this she answered,           ^ "I think of nothing concerning myself, Paul-I think only of him, there is the anguish." "You are insane, Miriam; yet, crazy as you are, you may do a great deal of harm-much to Thurston, but much more to yourself  It is not probable that the evidence -you think you have, will be considered by any magistrate of sufficient import- ance to be acted upon against a man of Mr. Willcoxen's life and character." "Heaven grant that such may be the case." "Attend I collect your thoughts-the evidencee you produce will probably be considered unimportant, and quite unworthy of attention; but what will be thought of you, who volunteer to offer it?" I had not reflected upon that--and now you mention it, I do not care." "And if, on the other hand-" the testimony which you have to offer, be considered ground for indictment, and Thurston is brought to trial, and acquitted, as he surely would be--" "Aye I Heaven send it "'! "And the whole affair blown all over the country-how would you appear?"  I know not, and care not, so he is cleared; Heaven grant I may be the only sufferer I I am willing to take the infamy."

At that moment the door was quietly opened, and Mr. Will- coxen entered. Miriam's countenance changed fearfully, but she wrung her hand from the clasp of Paul's, and hastened towards the door. Paul sprang forward and intercepted her. "What does this mean?" asked Mr. Willcoxen, stepping up to them. "It means that she is mad, and will do herself or somebody else much mischief," cried Paul, sharply. "For shame, Paul I Release her instantly," said Thurston, authoritatively. "Would you release a' lunatic, bent upon setting the house -on fire?" expostulated the young man, still holding her. "She is no lunatic; let her go instantly, sir." Paul, with a groan, complied.

The brothers looked at each other. "Thurston, do you know where she has gone? what she in- tends to do?"  "Yes-" "You do?'" "Assuredly." "And you would not prevent her?" "Most certainly not." Paul was gazing into his brother's eyes, and, as he gazed, every vestige of doubt and suspicion vanished from his mind; it was like the sudden clearing up of the sky, and shining forth of the sun; he grasped his brother's hands with cordial joy.

"How? would you have used force with Miriam? restrained her personal liberty?" "Yes! I would have done so I!"

Come into my study, and I will tell you the whole story." And Paul followed him thither. Some hours later in that day, Colonel Thornton was sitting, in his capacity of police magistrate, in his office at C . The room was occupied by about a dozen persons, men and women, black and white. He had just got through with one or two petty cases of debt or theft, and had up before him a poor, half- starved "White Herring," charged with sheep-stealing; when the door opened, and a young girl, closely veiled, entered and took a seat in the farthest corner from the crowd. The case of the poor man was soon disposed of-the evidence was not po- sitive-the compassionate magistrate leaned to the side of mercy, and the man was discharged, and went home most pro- bably to dine upon mutton!  This being the last case, the ma- gistrate arose and ordered the room to be cleared of all who had no further business with him. When the loungers had left the police office, the young girl came forward, stood before the magistrate, and raised her veil, revealing the features of Miriam. "Good morning, Miss Shields," said Colonel Thornton; and neither the countenance nor manner of this suave and stately gentleman of the old school, revealed the astonishment he really felt on seeing the young lady in such a place. He arose, and courteously placed her a chair, reseated himself, and turned towards her, and respectfully awaited her communication. "Colonel Thornton, you remember Miss Mavfield, and the manner of her death, that made some stir here about seven years ago?" The face of the old gentleman suddenly grew darkened and slightly convulsed, as the face of the sea when clouds and wind pass over it. "Yes, young lady, I remember." "I have come to denounce her murderer."   IND I CT A 3ENT.        587 Colonel Thornton took up his pen, and drew towards him a blank form of a writ, and sat looking towards her, and waiting for her further words. Her bosom heaved, her- face worked, her voice was choked and unnatural, as she said- "You will please to issue a warrant for the arrest of Thurston Willcoxen.  Colonel Thornton laid down his pen, arose from his seat, and took her hand and gazed upon her with an expression off blended surprise and compassion. "-My dear young lady, you are not very well. May I inquire -are your friends in town, or are you here alone?" ' I am here alone. Nayi I am not mad, Colonel Thornton, although your looks betray that you think me so." "No, no, not mad, only indisposed," said the Colonel, in no degree modifying his opinion. "Colonel Thornton, if there is anything strange and eccen- tric in my looks and manner, you must set it down to the strangeness of the position in which I am placed." "My dear young lady, Miss Thornton is at the hotel to-day. Will you permit me to take you to her?" "You will do as you please, Colonel Thornton, after you shall have heard my testimony, and examined the proofs I have to lay before you. Then I 'shall permit you to judge of my soundness of mind as you will, premising, however, that my sanity or insanity, can have no possible effect upon the proofs that I submit," she said, laying a packet upon the table between them. Something in her manner now compelled the magistrate to give her words an attention for which he blamed himself, as for a gross wrong, towards his favorite clergyman. "Do I understand you to charge Mr. Willcoxen with the death of Miss Mayfield?" "Yes," said Miriam, bowing her head.

"And you think that the only capacity in which you will be ,called upon to act? Well, may Heaven grant it," said Miriam, and she began, and told him all the facts that had recently come to her knowledge, ending by placing the packet of letters in his hands.    '  While she spoke, Colonel Thornton's pen was busy making minutes of her statements; when she had concluded, he laid down the pen, and turning to her, asked, "You believe, then, that Mr. Willcoxen committed this murder?" "I know not-I act only upon the evidence." "Circumstantial evidence, often as delusive as it is fatal! Do you think it possible that Mr. Willcoxen could have medi- tated such a crime?"' "No, no, no, no! never meditated it! if he committed it, it was unpremeditated, unintentional; the accident of some lover's quarrel, some frenzy of passion, jealousy, I know not What!"  "Let me ask you, then, why you volunteer to prosecute?"' "Because I must do so. But tell me, do you think what I have advanced trivial and unimportant?" asked Miriam, in a hopeful tone, for little she thought of herself, if only her obli- gation were discharged, and her brother still unharmed." "On the contrary, I think it so important as to constrain my instant attention, and oblige me to issue a warrant for the ap- prehension of Mr. Thurston Willcoxen," said Colonel Thorntop, as he wrote rapidly, filling out several blank documents. Then he rang a bell, that was answered by the entrance of several police officers. To the first he gave a warrant, saying,   INDICTMENT.           5 "You Will serve this immediately, upon Mr. Willcoxen.:"r And to another he gave some half dozen subpoenas, sa.ying,: "You will serve all these between this time and twelve to' morrow." When these functionaries were all discharged, Miriam arose and went to the magistrate.  "What do you think of the testimony ?" "It is more than sufficient to commit Mr. Willcoxen for trial; it may cost him his life." A sudden paleness passed over her face-; she turned to leave- the office, but the hand of deathW seemed to clutch her heart, arresting its pulsations, stopping the current of her blood, smothering her breath, and she fell to the floor. Wearily passed the day at Dell-Delight. Thurston, as usual,; sitting reading or writing at his library table. Paul rambling uneasily about the house, now taking up a book and attempting to read, now throwing it down in disgust. Sometimes almost, irresistibly impelled to spring upon his horse and gallop to Charlotte Hall-then restraining his strong impulse lest some- thing important should transpire at home during his absence; So passed the day until the middle of the afternoon.  Paul was walking up and'down the long piazza, indifferent for the first time in his life tothe loveliness- of the soft April atmosphere, that seemed to blend, raise and idealize the features of the landscape until earth, water and sky were harmonized ?: into celestial beauty. Paul was growing very anxious for the reappearance of Miriam, or for some news of her or her errand; yet dreading every moment an arrival of another sort. " "Where could the distracted girl be. Would her report be recetiedl and acted upon by the magistrate ? if so, what would be done: how would it all end? would Thurston sleep in his own bhouse or in a prison that night?  When would Miriam return ? Would she ever return, after having assumed such a task as sshe had taken upon herself."  These and other questions presented themselves every mo- &#xD;<pb n="590-591" xml:id="VAC7871-00000288"/> THE  MSS ING   BR IDE. ment, as he walked up and down the piazza, keeping an eye upon the distant road. Presently a cloud of dust in the distance arrested both his attention and his promenade, and brought his anxiety to a crisis. He soon perceived a single horseman galloping rapidly down the road, and never removed his eyes until the horseman turned into the gate and galloped swiftly up to the house. Then with joy Paul recognized the rider, and ran eagerly down the stairs to give him welcome, and reached the paved walk just as Cloudy drew rein and threw himself from the saddle. The meeting was a cordial, joyous one-with Cloudy, it was sincere, unmixed joy; with Paul, it was only a pleasant surprise and a transient forgetfulness.  Rapid questions were asked and answered, as they hurried into the house. Cloudy's ship had been ordered home sooner than had been expected; he had reached Norfolk a week before, B  that afternoon, and had immediately procured a horse and hurried on home. Hence his unlooked-for arrival. "How is Thurston ? how is Miriam? How are they all at Luckenough ?" "All are well ;the family at Luckenough are absent in the south, but are expected home every week." " And where is Miriam ?" At the village." "And Thurston ?" " In his library, as usual," said Paul, and touched the bell to summon a messenger to send to Mr. Willcoxen. Have you dined, Cloudy ?" "Yes, no-I ate some bread and cheese at the village; don't fuss, I'd rather wait till supper-time." The door opened, and Mr. Willcoxen entered. Whatever secret anxiety might have weighed ipon the min- Ister's heart, no sign of it was suffered to appear upon his countenance, as smiling cordially, he came in holding out his hand to. welcome his cousin and early playmate, expressing equal surprise and pleasure at seeing him.   Cloudy had to go over the ground of explanation of his sudden arrival, and by the time he had finished, old Jenny came in laughing and wriggling with joy to see him. But Jenny did not remain long in the parlor, she hurried' out into the kitchen to express her feelings professionally by preparing a- welcome feast. "And you are not married yet, Thurston, as great a favorite as you are with the ladies ? How is that ? Every time I come home, I expect to be presented to a Mrs. Willcoxen, and never am gratified; why is that ?"  " Perhaps I believe in the celibacy of the clergy." "Perhaps you have never recovered the- disappointment of losing Miss Le Roy ?" "Ah   Cloudy, people who live in glass houses, should not throw stones; I suspect you judge, me by yourself? how,is, it with you, Cloudy ? has no fair maiden been able to teach you to forget your boy-love for Jacquelina ?" Cloudy winced, but tried to cover his embarrassment with a laugh. "Oh! I have been in love forty dozen times, I'm always in love; my heart is continually going through a circle from one fit to another, like the sun through the signs of the zodiac; only it never comes to anything," "Well, at least little Jacko is forgotten; which is one con- gratulatory circumstance." " No, she is not forgotten; I will not wrong her by saying that she is or could be ! all other loves are merely the foreign ports, which my heart visits transiently now and then. Uina is its native home. I don't know how it is. With most cases of disappointment, such as yours with Miss Le Roy, I suppose the regret may be short-lived enough; but when an affection has been part and parcel of one's being from infancy up; why it is in one's soul and heart and blood, so to speak--is identi- cal with one's consciousness, and inseparable from one's life." " Do you ever see her ?" "See her! yes, but how? at each return from a voyage, I &#xD;<pb n="592-593" xml:id="VAC7871-00000289"/> ;92     TH-E  MSSING   BRIDE., may see her once; with an iron grating between us; she dis- guised with her black shrouding robe and veil, and thinking that she must suffer here to expiate the fate of Doctor Grim- shaw, who, scorpion-like, stunghimself to death with the venom of his own bad passions. She is a Sister of Mercy, devoted to good works, and leaves her convent only in times of war, plague, pestilence or famine, to minister to the suffering. She nurse  me through the yellow fever, when I lay in the hospital, at New Orleans, but when I got well enough tod recognize her, she van- ished-evaporated-made herself 'thin air,' and another sister served in her place." "Have you ever seen her since ?" Yes, once; I sought out her convent, and went with the fixed determination to reason with her, and to persuade her not to renew her vows for another year; you know the Sisters only take vows for a year at a time." "Did you make any impression on her mind?" inquired Thurston, with more interest than he had yet shown in any part of the story.  "'Make any impression on her mind !' no. I-I did not even attempt} to; how could I, when I only saw her behind a grate, with the prioress on one side of her, and the portress on the other ? My visit was silent enough, and short enough, and sad enough. Why can't she come out of that ? What have I done to deserve to be iade miserable ? I don't deserve it. I am the most ill-used man in the United States service." While Cloudy spoke, old Jenny was hurrying in and out be- tween the house and the kitchen, and busying herself with setting the table, laying the cloth, and arranging the service.  But presently she came in, throwing wide the door, and announcing, '" Two gemmun, axin to see marster." Thurston arose, and turned to front them, while Paul became suddenly pale, on recognizing two police officers. "Good-afternoon, Mr. Willcoxen-good-afternoon, gentle- men," said tile foremost, and most respectable-looking of the two, lifting his bat, and bowing to the fire-side party. Then   replacing it, he said: "Mr. Willcoxen, will you be kind enough to step this way, and give me your attention, sir."  He walked to the window, and Thurston followed him. Paul stood with a pale face, ard firmly compressed lip, and gazed after them.  And Cloudy-unsuspicious Cloudy, arose, and stood with his back to the fire, and whistled a sea air. "Mr. Willcoxen, you can see for yourself the import of thib paper," said the officer, handing the warrant. Thurston read it and returned it. "Mr. Willcoxen, myself and my comrade came hither on horseback. Let me suggest to you to order your carriage. One of us will accompany you in the drive, and all remarks will be avoided."  "I thank you for the hint, Mr. Jenkins; I had, however, intended to do as you advise," said Thurston, beckoning his brother to approach. "Paul I I am a prisoner, say nothing at present to Cloudy; permit him to assume that business takes me away, and go now quietly and order horses put to the carriage." "Dr. Douglass, we shall want your company also," said the officer, serving Paul with a subpoena. Paul ground his teeth together, and rushed out of the door. "Keep an eye on that yqung man," said the policeman to his comrade, and the latter followed Paul into the, yard, and on to the stables. The haste and passion of Paul's manner had attracted Cloudy's attention, and now he stood looking on with surprise and inquiry. "Cloudy," said Thurston, approaching him, "a most press- ing affair demands my presence at C  this afternoonf. Paul must also attend me. I may not return to-night. Paul, how- ever, certainly will. In the meantime, Cloudy, my boy, make yourself as much at home and as happy as you possibly can."' "Oh! don't mind me I never make a stranger of me. Go b, all means.

Any parishioner ill, dying, and wanting your ghostly con- solations?" "Oh, no," said Thurston; smiling. "Glad of it-go by all means. I will make myself jolly until you return," said Cloudy, walking up and down the floor whistling a love ditty, and thinking of little Jacko; he always thought of her with tenfold intensity whenever he returned home, and came into her neighborhood. "Mr. Jenkins, will you follow me to my library," said Thurston. The officer bowed assent, and Mr. Willcoxen proceeded thither for the purpose of securing his valuable papers,'and locking his secretary and writing-desk. After an absence of some fifteen minutes, they returned to the parlor to find Paul and the constable awaiting them. "Is the carriage ready?" asked Mr. Willcoxen. "Yes, sir," replied the constable. "Then, I believe, we also are-is it not so?" The police officer bowed, and Mr. Willcoxen walked up to Cloudy and held out his hand. ' Good-bye, Cloudy, for -the present. Paul will probably be home by nightfall, even if I should be detained." "Oh,ldon't hurry yourself upon my account. I shall do very well. Jenny can take care of me," said Cloudy, jovially, as he shook the offered hand of Thnrston Paul could not trust himself to look Cloudy in the face and say "Good-bye."' He averted his head, and so followed Mr. Willcoxen aund the officer into the yard. Mr. Willcoxen, t he senior officer, and Paul Douglass, entered. the carriage, and :the second constable attended on horseback, and so the party set out for Charlotte Hall. Hour after hour passed. Old Jenny came in:and put the supper on the table, and stood presiding over the urn and tea- pot while Cloudy ate his supper. Old Jenny's tongue ran as if she felt obliged to make up in conversation for the absence of the rest of the family.   INDICTMENT.            695 j"Lord knows, IPse glad 'nough you'se comed back," she said; "dis yer place is bad 'nough.

Cloudy laughed and tried to cheer her spirits by a gay reply, and then' they kept up between them a lively badinage of repartee, in which old Jenny acquitted herself quite as wittily as her young master. And after supper she cleared away the service, and went to pre- pare a bed and light a fire in the room appropriated to Cloudy. And so the evening wore away. It grew late, yet neither Thurston .or Paul appeared. Cloudy began to think their return unseasonably delayed, and at eleven o'clock he took up his lamp to retire to his chamber, when he was startled and arrested by the barking of dogs, and by the rolling of the carriage into the yard, and in a few minutes- the door was thrown violently open, and Paul Douglass, pale, hag- gard, convulsed, and despairing, burst suddenly into the room. "Paul I Paul I what in She name of Heaven has happened?" cried Cloudy, starting up, surprised and alarmed by his appear- ance.-  "Oh, it has ended in his committal! -it has ended in his committal l--he is fully committed for trial --he was sent off to-night to the county jail at Leonardtown, in the custody of two officers!" "Who is committed? What are you talking about, Paul?' said Cloudy, taking his hand kindly and looking in his face. These words and actions brought Paul somewhat to his senses. "Oh you do not know l--you do not even guess anything about it, Cloudy I Oh, it is a terrible misfortune 1 Let me sit down, and I will tell you l"  And Paul Douglass threw himself into a chair, and in an  &#xD;<pb n="596-597" xml:id="VAC7871-00000291"/> 596     t THE MSSING   B IDE. igitated, nearly incoherent manner, related the circumstances hat led to the arrest of Thurston Willcoxen for the murder of Marian Mayfield. When he had concluded the strange story, Cloudy started up, ook his hat, and was about to-leave the room. "Where are you going, Cloudy?" "To the stables to saddle my horse, to ride to Leonardtown his night i" "It is nearly twelve o'clock." "I know it, but by hard riding I can reach Leonardtown by lorning, and be with Thurston as soon as the prison-doors are pened. And I will:ask you, Paul, to be kind enough to for- rard my trunks from the tavern at Benedict to Leonardtown, rhere I shall remain to be near Thurston as long as he needs ly services." "God bless you, Cloudy I myself wished to accompany him, ut he would not for a moment hear of my doing so-he entreated ie to return hither to take care of poor Fanny and the home-  tead. Cloudy scarcely waited to hear this benediction, but hurried ) the stables, found and saddled his horse, threw himself into the bitrups, and in five minutes was dashing rapidly through the lick, low-lying forest stretching inland from the coast. Eight hours of hard riding brought him to the county seat. Just stopping long enough to have his horse put up at the est hotel, and to inquire his way to the prison, he hurried lither. It was nearly nine o'clock, and the street corners were ironged with loungers conversing in low, eager tones upon the resent all-absorbing topic of discourse-the astounding event F the arrest of the great preacher, the Reverend Thurston Tillcoxen, upon the charge of murder. Hurrying past all these, Cloudy reached the jail. He readily gained admittance, and was conducted to the cell of the pri- ner. He found Thurston attired as when he left home, sitting ; a small wooden stand, and calmly occupied with his pen..   I NDIOT ME   NT.       597' He arose, and smilingly extended his hand, saying, "This is very kind as well as very prompt, Cloudy. Yowu must have ridden fast." "I did. Leave us alone, if you please, my friend," .said Cloudy, turning to the jailor. The latter went out, and locked the door upon the friends. "This seems a sad event to greet you on your return home, Cloudy: but never mind, it will all be well!" "Sad?  It's a farce! I have not an instant's misgiving about the result; but the present indignity! Oh 1 oh I could---" "Be calm, my dear Cloudy, Have you heard anything of the circumstances that led to this?' "Yes! Paul told me; but he is as crazy and incoherent as, a Bedlamite I want you, if you please, Thurston, if-you have , no objection, to go over the whole story for me, that I may see if I can make anything of it, for your defence."  "Poor Paul he takes this matter far too deeply to heart; sit down. I have not a second chair to offer, but take this or the foot of the cot, as you prefer." Cloudy took the foot of the cot.  "Certainly, Cloudy, I will tell. you everything," said Thurs, ton, and forthwith commenced his explanation. Thurston's narrative was clear and to the point. When it was finished, Cloudy asked a number of questions, chiefly referring  to the day of the tragedy. When these were answered, he sat with his brows gathered down in astute thought. Presently hq asked,                          , - "Thurston, have you engaged counsel?" "Yes; Mr. Romford has been with me this morning."    1 "Is he fully competent?"  "The best lawyer in the state," "When does the court sit?" ' "On Monday week."  "Have you any idea whether your trial will come on early it  the session?"  "I presume it will come on Very soon, as Mr. Romford mi I forms me there are but few cases on the docket." A* ^ a- '- !

"Thank Hleaven for that, as your confinement here promises to be of very short duration. However, the limited time makes it the more necessary for me to act with the greater promptitude. I came here with the full intention of remaining in town as long as you should be detained in this infernal place, but I shall have to leave you within the hour." "Of course, Cloudy, my dear boy, I could not expect you to restrict yourself to this town so soon after escaping from the confinement of your ship At "' Oh I you don't understand me at all I Do you think I am going away on my own business, or amusement, while you are hereO? To the devil with the thought-begging your rever- ence's pardon. No, I am going in search of Jacquelina. Since hearing your explanation, particularly that part of it re- lating to your visit to Luckenough, upon the morning of the day of Marianu's death, and the various scenes that -occurred there-certain vague ideas of my own have taken form and color-and I feel convinced that Jacquelina could throw some light upon this affair." "Indeed! why should you think so?" "Oh from many small indexes, which I have neither the time not the inclination to tell you; for taken apart from col- lateral circumstances and associations, they would appear vision- ary. Each in itself is really trivial enough, but in the mass they are very indicative. At least I think so, and I, must seek Jacquelina out immediately. And to do so, Thurston, I must leave you this moment, for there is a boat to leave the wharf for Baltimore this morning, if it has not already gone. It will take me two days to reach Baltimore, another day to get to her convent, and it will altogether be five or six days before I can- get-back here. Good-bye, Thurston, Heaven keep you, and give you a speedy deliverance from this black hole 1" And Cloudy threw his arms around Thurston in a brotherly embrace, and then knocked at the door to be let out. In half-an-hour, Cloudy was' "once more upon the waters," in full sail for Baltimore.   CHWAPTER XLTIV. M ARIA N. "Rise I for the day is breaking, Though the dull night be long; Rise I God is not forsaking Thy heart-he strong be strong I Rise I for the time is hasting When life shall be made clear And all who know heart-wasting, Shall feel that God is dear!"-- .: T. GREAT was the consternation caused by the arrest of a gen- tleman so high in, social rank and scholastic and theological reputation, as the Reverend Thurston Willcoxen, and upon a charge, too, so awful as that for which he stood committed I It was the one all-absorbing subject of thought and conversa- tion. People neglected their business, forgetting to work, to bargain, buy or sell. Village shop-keepers, instead of vamping Ttheir wares, leaned eagerly over their counters, and with great dilated eyes and dogmatical fore-fingers, discussed with'cus- tomers the merits or demerits of the great case. Village mecha- nics, occupied solely with the: subject of the pastor's guilt or innocence,' disappointed with impunity customers who were themselves too deeply interested and too highly excited by the same subject, to remember, far less to rebuke them, for unful, filled engagements. Eveh women totally neglected, or badly fulfilled, their domestic avocations; for who in the parish could sit down quietly to the construction of a garment or a pudding while their beloved pastor, the "all praised"Thurso ton Willcoxen, lay in prison awaiting his trial for a capital crime?  As usual in such cases, there was very little cool reasoning, and very much passionate declamation.  The first astonishment (599)   :  &#xD;<pb n="600-601" xml:id="VAC7871-00000293"/> 600     THE   MSSING   BRIDE.  had given place to conjecture, which yielded in turn to dog. matic judgments-acquiescing or condemning, as the self-con. stituted judges happened to be favorable or adverse to the cause of the minister. In a word, those who are familiar with the circumstances attending a Boston tragedy, that electrified the country some few years ago, can readily imagine the social convulsion that ensued-upon the arrest of a clergyman so justly celebrated, so honored and beloved, upon a charge so horrible and loathly. When the first Sabbath after the arrest came, and the church was closed -because the pulpit was unoccupied, the dispersed congregation, haunted by the vision of the absent pastor in his cell, discussed the matter anew, and differed and disputed, and fell out worse than ever-parties formed for and against the minister, and party feuds raged high. Upon the second Sabbath-being the day before the county court should sit-a substitute filled the pulpit of Mr. Wil]- coxen, and his congregation re-assembled to hear an edifying discourse from the text-"I myself have seen the ungodly in great power, and flourishing like a green bay tree. I went by, and lo 1 he was gone-; I sought him, but his place was nowhere to be found."  This sermon bore rather hard (by pointed allusions) upon the great elevation and sudden downfall of the celebrated minister, and, in consequence, delighted one portion of the audience and enraged  the ,other. The last-mentioned charged the new preacher with envy, hatred and malice, and all uncharitable- ness, besides the wish to rise on the ruin of his unfortunate predecessor, and they went home in high indignation, resolved not to set foot within the parish church again. until the honor- able acquittal of their own beloved pastor should put all his enemies, persecutors, and slanderers to shame.  The excitement spread, and gained force and fire with space. The press took it up, and went to war as the people had done. ,nd as far as the name of Thurston Willcoxen had been wafted by the breath of fame, it was now blown  by the "Blatant   MA RIAn.            601 Beast." Aye, and farther too I for those who had never even, heard of his great talents, his learning, his eloquence, -his zeal, and his charity, were made familiar with his imputed crime, and, shuddered while: they denounced. And this was natural and well, so far as it went to prove that great excellence is so much less rare than great evil, as to excite less attention. The news of this signal event spread like wildfire all over the country, from Maine to Louisiana, and from Missouri to Florida, pro- ducing everywhere great excitement, but falling in three places. with the crushing force of -a thunderbolt. V First by Marian's fireside. In a private- parlor of a quiet hotel, in one of the eastern, cities, sat the lady, now nearly thirty years of age, yet still in, the bloom of her womanly beauty. She had lately arrived from Europe, charged with one of those benevolent missions which it Wvas the business and the i consolation of her life to fulfill.  It was late in the afternoon, and the, low descending suna threw its golden gleam across the round table at which she sat, busily'engaged with reading reports, making notes, and writing letters connected with the affair upon which she had come. Seven years had not changed Marian much-a little -less vivid, perhaps, the bloom oni cheeks and lips, a shade paler the angel brow, a shade darker the:xich and lustrous auburn tresses,. softer and calmer, fuller of thought and love the clear blue; eyes-sweeter her tones, and gentler all her motions-that was, all. Her dress was insignificant, in material, make and color, yet the wearer unconsciously imparted a classic and regal grace to every fold and fall of the drapery. No splendor of apparel, could have given such effect to her individual beauty as this quiet costume; I would I were an artist, that I might repro- duce her image as she was--the glorious face and head, the; queenly form, in its plain but graceful robe of? I know not what --gray serge, perhaps. Her whole presence-'her cointenance, manner and tone re-. vealed the richness, strength and serenity of, a faithful, loving;  &#xD;<pb n="602-603" xml:id="VAC7871-00000294"/> 602     THE  MSSING   B  IDE. self-denying, God-reliant soul-of on6 who could recall the past, endure the present, and anticipate the future without regret, complaint or fear. Sometimes the lady's soft eyes would lift themselves from her work, to rest with tenderness upon the form of a little clild, so small and still that you would not have noticed her presence, but in following the lady's loving glance. She sat in a tiny rocking chair, nursing a little white rabbit on her lap. She  Was not a beautiful child-she was too diminutive and pale, with hazy blue eyes, and fady yellow hair-yet her little face was so demure and sweet, so meek and loving, that it would haunt and soften you more than that of a beautiful child could. The child had been orphaned from her birth, and when but a few days old, had been received into the "Children's Home.'* Marian never had a favorite among her children, but this little waif was so completely orphaned, so desolate and desti- tute, and withal so puny, fragile, and lifeless, that Marian took her to her own heart day and night, imparting from her own fine vital temperament the warmth and vigor that nourished the perishing little human blossom to life and health. If ever a mother's heart lived in a maiden's bosom, it was in Marian's. As she had cherished Miriam, she now cherished Angel, and she was as fondly loved by the one as she had been by the other. And-so for five years past Angel had been Marian's  inseparable companion. She sat with her little lesson, or her sewing, or her pet rabbit, at Marian's feet while she worked- held her hand when she walked out, sat by her side at the table or in the carriage, and slept nestled in her arms at night. She was the one earthly blossom that bloomed in Marian's soli- tary path. Angel now sat with her rabbit on her knees, waiting de- murely till Marian should have time to notice her. And the lady still worked on, stopping once 'in a while to smile upon the child. There was a file of the evening papers lying near at hand upon the table where she wrote, but- Marian had not yet had time to look at them. Soon, however, she had   MARIAN.           603 occasion to refer to one of them for the names of the members of the Committee on Public Lands.- In casting her eyes over the paper, her glanee suddenly lighted upon a paragraph that sent all the blood from her cheeks to her heart. She dropped the paper, sank back in her chair, and covered her blanched face with both hands, and strove for self-control.  Angel softly put down the rabbit, and gently stole to her side and looked up with her little face full of wondering sym- pathy. Presently Marian began passing her hands slowly over her forehead, with a sort of unconscious self-mesmerism, and then she dropped them wearily upon her lap, and Angel saw how pallid was her face, how ashen and tremulous her lip, how quivering her hands. But after a few seconds, Marian stooped and picked the paper up, and read the long, wonder-mongering affair, in which all that had been, and all that had seemed, as well as many things that could neither be nor seem, was related at length, or conjectured, or suggested. It began by announcing the arrest of the Reverend Thurston Willcoxen upon the charge of mur-  der, and then went back to the beginning, and related the  whole story, from the first disappearance of Marian Mayfield, to  the late discoveries that had led to the apprehension of the sup- posed murderer, with many additions and improvements gathered in the rolling of the ball of falsehood. Among the rest,-that the body of the unhappy young lady had been washed ashore several miles below the scene of her dreadful fate, and had beeni charitably interred bysome poor fishermen. The article con- cluded by describing the calm demeanor-of the accused and the contemptuous manner in which he treated a charge so grave, scorning even to deny it.  "Oh, I do not wonder at the horror and consternation this matter has caused. When the deed was attempted, more than  the intended death wound did it overcome me! And nothing,  nothing in the universe but the evidence of my own senses could  have convinced me of his purposed guilt I And still I cannot realize it I He must have been insane But he treats the dis.-   .  &#xD;<pb n="604-605" xml:id="VAC7871-00000295"/> 604'    TTHE  MSSI NG   BRIDE. covery of his intended and supposed crime with scorn and con- tempt I Alas I alas is this the end of years of suffering and probation? Is this the fruit of that long remorse, from which I had hoped so much for his redemption? A remorse without repentance, and barren of reformation Yet I must save him!" She arose and rung the bell, and gave orders to have two se ats secured for her in the coach that would leave in the morn- ing for Baltimore. And then she began to walk up-and down the floor, to try and walk off the excitement that was fast gaining upon her.                           d Before this night and this discovery, not for the world would Marian have made her existence known to him, far less would she have sought his presence. Nay, deeming such a meeting improper as it was impossible, her mind had never contemplated it for an instant. She had watched his course, sent anonymous donations to his charities, hoped much from his repentance and good works, but never hoped in' any regard to herself. But - , now it was absolutely necessary that she should make her ex- istence known to him. She would go to himn She must save him 1 :She should see him, and speak to him-him whom she had never hoped to meet again in life I She would see him again in three days I The thought was too exciting even foi her' strong heart and frame, and calm self-governing nature!  And in defiance of reason and of will, her long-buried youth- ful love, her pure, earnest, single-hearted love, burst its secret sepulchre, and rejoiced through all her nature. The darkness of the past was, for the time, forgotten. Memory recalled no picture of unkindness, injustice, or inconstancy. Even the scene upon the beach was faded, gone, lost. But the' light of lie past glowed around her--their seaside strolls and woodland wanderings-  "The still, green places where they met, The moonlit branches dewy wet, The greeting and the parting word, The smile, the embrace, the tone that made ,An Eden of the forest shade."  ,               , X   MARIAN.,           605 kindling a pure rapture from memory, and a wild longing from hope, that her full heart could scarce contain. But soon came on another current of thought and feelirg opposed to the first-doubt and fear of the meeting. For her- self she felt that she could forget all the sorrows of the past, aye! and with fervent glowing soul, and flushed cheeks, and tearful eyes, and clasped hands, she adored the Father in Heaven that He had put no limit to forgiveness-no I in that blessed path of light all space was open to the human will, and the  heart might forgive infinitely-and to its own measureless ex- tent I But how would Thurston meet her? He had suffered such tortures from remorse, that doubtless he wouldrejoice " with exceeding great joy" to find that the deed attempted in some  fit of madness, had really not been effected. But his sufferings had sprung from remorse of conscience, not from remorse of love. No! except as his deliverer, he would probably not be pleased to see her. As soon as this thought had seized her mind, then indeed all the bitterer scenes in the past started up to life, and broke 4own the defences reared by love, and faith, and hope, and let in the tide of anguish and despair that rolled over her soul, shaking it as it had not been shaken for many years. And her head fell upon her bosom, and her hands were clasped convulsively, as she walked up and down the floor' -striving with herself-striving' to subdue the rebel passions  of her heart-striving to attain her' wonted calmness, aw4 strength, and self-possession, and at last praying earnestly:- "Oh, Father the rains descend, and the floods come, and the winds blow and beat upon my soul; let not its strenthfall as if built upon the sand." And so she walked up and down, striving and praying; nor was the struggle in vain-once more she "conquered a peace" in her own bosom.  She turned :her eyes upon little Angel. The infant was drooping over one arm of her rocking-chair, like a fading lily, but her soft hazy eyes, full of vague sympathy, followed the lady wherever she went. 38 !

It was now twilight;, and Marian rang for lights, and Angel's milk and bread, which were soon brought. And then with her usual quiet tenderness, she undressed the little one, heard her prayers, took her up, and as she rocked, sang a sweet low evening hymn, that soothed the child to sleep, and her own heart to perfect rest. And early the next morning, Marian and little Angel set out by the first coach for Baltimore, on their way to St. Mary's county. The Convent of Bethlehem was not only the sanctuary of pro- fessed nuns, the school of girls, the nursery of orphans, but it was also the temporary home of those Sisters of Mercy, who go forth into the world only on errands of Christian love and charity, and return to their convent often only to die, worn out by toil among scenes and sufferers near which few but them- selves would venture. And as they pass hence to Heaven, their ranks are still filled up from the world-not always by the weary and disappointed.  Often young Catholic girls volun- tarily leave the untried world that is smiling fair before them to enter upon a life of poverty, self-denial, and merciful ministra- tions; so even in this century the order of the Sisters of Mercy is kept up.  Among the most active and zealous of the order of Bethlehem was the Sister Theresa, the youngest of the band. Youthful as she was, however, this sister's heart was no sweet sacrifice of "a flower offered in the bud--" on the contrary I am afraid that Sister Theresa had trifled with, and pinched, and bruised, and trampled the poor budding heart, until she thought it good for nothing upon earth, before she offered it to heaven. I fear it was nothing higher than that strange revulsion of feeling, world weariness, disappointment, disgust, remorse, fanaticism- either,- any, or all of these, call it what you will, that in past ages and Catholic countries have filled monasteries with the' whilome  gay, worldly and ambitious; that has sent many a woman in the prime of her beauty, and many a man at the acme -^ i               '  .

Charles V. into a cowled and shrouded monk; the reck- less swash-bucklar, Ignatius Loyola, into a holy saint, and the beautiful Louise de la Valliere into an ascetic nun; which finally metamorphosed the gayest, maddest, merriest elf that ever danced into the moonlight, into-Sister Theresa. - Poor Jacquelina I for, of course, you can have no doubt that it is of her we are speaking-she perpetrated her last'lugubrious joke on the day that she was to have made her vows, for when asked what patron saint she would select by taking that saint's name in religion, she answered--St. Theresa, becausxe St. The- resa would understand her case the best, having been, like her- self, a scamp and a rattle-brain before she took it into her head to astonish her friends by becoming a saint. Poor Jacko said this with the solemnest face and the most serious earnestness, but with such a reputation as she had had for pertness, of course nobody would believe butt that she was making fun of the "Blessed Theresa," and so she was put-upon farther probation, with the injunction to say the seven penitential psalms seven times a day, until she was in a holier frame of mind; which she did, though under protest, that she didn't think the words com- posed by David, to express his remorse for his own- enormous sin, exactly suited her case. Sister Theresa, if the least steady and devout, was certainly the -nost active and zealous and ,Cou- rageous among, them all. She yawned horribly over the long litanies and longer sermons; but if ever there was a work of mercy requiring extraordinary labor, privation, exposure and danger, Sister Theresa was the one to face in the cause light- ning and tempest; plague, pestilence, and famine; battle, and murder, and sudden deathl I appy was she?or content? No --she was moody, hysterical, and devotional by turns- some- times a zeal for good works would possess her; sometimes the old fun and quaintness would break out; and sometimes an overwhelming fit of remorse;-each depending upon the acci- dental cause that would chance to arouse the moods.- Humane creatures are like climates-some of a temperate ,^MF"',2t f e A , s g   &#xD;<pb n="608-609" xml:id="VAC7871-00000297"/> 608     T H E  MSSING    B I DE. atmosphere, take even life-long sorrow serenely--never forget. ting, and never exaggerating its cause-never very wretched, if never quite happy. Others of a more torrid nature, have long sunny seasons of bird-like cheerfulness and happy forget- fulness, until some slight cause, striking "the electric chain wherewith we are darkly bound," shall startle up memory-and grief, intensely realized, shall rise to anguish, and a storm shall  pass through the soul, shaking it almost to dissolution, and the poor subject thinks, if she can think, that her heart must go to pieces this time I But the storm passes, and nature, instead of being destroyed, is refreshed and ready for the sunshine and the song-birds again. The elastic heart throws off its weight, the spirits revive, and life goes on joyously in [harmony with nature. So it was with Jacquelina, with this sad difference, that as her trouble was more than sorrow--as it was remorse-it was never quite thrown off. It was not that her conscience re- proached her for the fate of Dr. Grimshaw, which was brought on by his own wrong doing-but Marian--that a wild, wanton frolic of her own should have caused the early death of one so young, and beautiful, and good as Marian that was the thought that nearly drove poor Jacquelina mad with remorse, whenever she realized it. Dr. Grimshaw was forgiven, and-forgotten; but the thought of Marian was the " undying worm," that preyed upon her heart. And so, year after year, despite the arguments and persuasions of nearest friends, and the constancy of poor Cloudy, Jacquelina tearfully turned from love, friendship, wealth and ease, and renewed her vows of poverty, celibacy, obedience, and the service of the poor, sick and ignorant, in the hope of expiating her offence, soothing the voice of conscience, and gaining peace. Jacquelina would have made her vows per- petual, by taking the black veil, but her Superior constantly dissuaded her from it-she was young, and life, with its possi- bilities, was all before her; she must wait many years before she took the step that could not be retracted without perjury. And so each, year she renewed her vow a twelvemonth. The seventh '^                   \    MARIAN N.           609 year of her religious life was drawing to its close, and she had notified her superior of her wish now, after so many years of probation, to take the black veil, and make her vows perpetual. And the Abbess had, at length, listened favorably to her ex- pressed wishes. But a few days after this, as the good old Mother, Martha, the portress, sat dozing over her rosary, behind the hall grating -the outer door was thrown open,-:and :a young man, in a mid- shipman's undress uniform, entered rather brusquely, and came up to the grating. Touching his hat precisely as if the old lady had been his superior officer, he said hastily, "Madame, if you please, I wish -to see Mrs. --- ; you know who I mean, I presume? my cousin, Jacquelina." The portress knew well enough, for she had seen Cloudy there several times before, but she replied,        - "You mean, young gentleman, that pious daughter, called. in the world Mrs. Grimshaw, butin religion Sister Theresa?" "Fal lal Hthat is-I beg your pardon, Mother, but I wish, to see the lady immediately; can I do so? "The dear sister Theresa is at present making her retreat, preparatory to taking the black veil." ! "The what!" exclaimed Cloudy, with as much horror as if it had been the ' black dose' she was going to take. "The black veil-and so she cannot be seen." "Madam I have a very pressing form of invitation here, which people are not very apt to disregard. Did you ever hear of a subpoena, deal Mother?"           " The good woman never had, but she thought it evidently something " uncanny," for she said-"I will send for the Ab- bess ;" and she beckoned to a nun within, and sent her on the errand-and soon the Abbess appeared, and Cloudy made known the object of his visit. "Go into the parlor, sir, and Sister Theresa will attend you," said that lady. And Cloudy turned to a side door on his right hand, and went into the little receiving room, three sides of which were  &#xD;<pb n="610-611" xml:id="VAC7871-00000298"/> 1uV      THE  MSSING   BRIDE. like other rooms, but the fourth side was a grating instead of a wall. Behind this grating appeared Jacquelina--so white and thin with confinement, fasting, and vigil, and so disguised by her nun's dress, as to be unrecognizable to any but a lover's eyes: with her was the Abbess. Cloudy went up to the grating-Jacquelina put her hand through, and spoke a kind greeting; but Cloudy glanced at the Abbess, looked reproachfully at Jacquelina, and then turning to the former said,_-- "Madam, I wish to say a few words in confidence, to my cousin here. Can I be permitted to do so ?.. "Most certainly, young gentleman; Sister Theresa is not restricted.  It was at her own request that I attended her hither." " Thank you, dear lady-that which I have to say to- Sister Theresa--involves the confidence of others: else, I should not have made the request that yout have so kindly granted," said Cloudy, considerably mollified. The Abbess curtsied in the old stately way, and retired. Cloudy looked at Jacquelina reproachfully. " Are you going to be a nun, Lina ?" " Yes. Oh I Cloudy, Cloudy, what do you come here to dis turb my thoughts so for I  Oh ! Cloudy ! every time you come to see me, you do so upset and confuse my mind I You have no idea how-many aves and paters, and psalms and litanies I have to say before I can quiet my mind down again ! And now this is worse than all. Dear, dear Cloudy!--St. Mary,  ' forgive me, I   never meant that-I  meant plain Cloudy-see how you make me sin in words!    What did you send Mother Ettienne away for ?" " That I might talk to you alone. Why do you deny me that small consolation, Lina? How have I offended, thliat vou should treat me so ?" "In no way at all have you offended, dearest Cloudy- St. Peter! there it is again--I mean only Cloudy." " Never mind explaining the distinction. You are going to   MARIAN0 be a nun, you say I Very well-let that pass, too But you F must leave your convent, and go into the world yet once more, and then I shall'have opportunities of talking; to you before your return." "No, no; n'ever will I leave my convent-never will I sub- ject my soul to such a temptation." "My dear Lina, I have the cabalistic words that must draw you forth-listen I Our cousin, Thurston Willcoxen, is in pri- son, charged with the murder of Marian Mayfield'--a stifled shriek from Jacquelina-- and there is circumstantial evidence against him strong enough to ruin him for'ever, if it does not cost him his life. Now, Lina, I cannot be wrong in supposing that you know who struck that death-blow, and that your evidence can thoroughly exonerate Thurston from suspicionul Am I right?" "Yes I yes I you are right," exclaimed Jacquelina, in great agitation. "You will go, then?" "Yes! yes." "When?" "In an hour-this moment-with you." "With me?" "Yes I may do so it such a case. I must do so I Oh I Heaven knows, I have occasioned sin enough, without causing more against poor Thurston!" "You will get ready then immediately, dear Lina. Are you sure there will be no opposition?"  "Certainly not. Why, Cloudy, are you one of those who credit 'raw head and bloody bones' fables about convents? I hav'e no jailor but my own conscience, Cloudy. Besides, imy year's vows expired yesterday, and I am free for awhile, before renewing them perpetually," said Jacquelina, hurrying away to get ready.              '      '- ". And may I be swung to the yard-arm if ever I let ,you  renew them," said Cloudy, while he waited for her, . -  Jacquelina was soon ready-and Cloudy rejoined her in the i  &#xD;<pb n="612-613" xml:id="VAC7871-00000299"/> "2     THE:   MiSSIN G   BRIDET; front entry-behind the grating of which the good old portress, as she watched the handsome middy drive off with her young postulant, devoutly crossed herself, and diligently told her beads, Commodore Waugh and his family were returning slowly / from the South, stopping at all the principal towns for long rests on their way homeward. The Commodore was now a wretched, helpless old man, depending almost for his daily life, upon the care and tender- ness of Mrs. Waugh. Good Benrietta, with advancing years, had continued to "wax fat," and now it was about as much as she could do, with many grunts, to get up and down stairs. Since her double bereavement of her "Hebel and her "Lapwing," her kind, motherly countenance had lost somewhat of its comfortable jol- lity, and her hearty mellow laugh was seldom heard. Still good Henrietta was passably happy, as the world goes, for she had the lucky foundation of a happy temper and temperament--she enjoyed the world, her friends and her creature comforts--her sound, innocent sleep-her ambling pony, or her easy carriage -her hearty meals and her dreamy doze in the soft arm-chair of an afternoon, while Mrs -L'Oiseau droned, in a dreary voice, long homilies for the good of the Commodore's soul. Mrs. L'Oiseau had got to be one of the saddest and maddest fanatics that ever afflicted a family. And there were hours when, by holding up too graphic,- terrific, and exasperating pictures of the veteran's past and present wickedness and im- penitence; and his future retribution, in the shape of an exter- nal roasting in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone- she drove the old man half frantic with rage and fright I And 'then she would nearly finish him by asking--If hell was so hor- rible to hear of for a little while, what must it be to feel forever and ever? They had reached Charleston, on their way home. Mrs. j' tOiseau, too much fatigued to persecute her uncle for his good, had gone to her chamber.   MARIAN. N6t The Commodore was put comfortably to bed. And Mrs. Waugh took the day's-paper, and sat down by thile old man's side, to read him the news until he should get sleepy. As she turned the paper about, her eyes fell upon the same paragraph that had so agitated Marian. Now, Henrietta was by no means excitable-on the contrary, she was rather hard to be moved; but on seeing this announcement of the arrest of Mr. Willcoxen, for the crime with which he was charged, an exclamation of horror and amazement burst from her lips. In another moment she had controlled herself, and would gladly have kept the exciting news from the sick man' until the morning. But it was too late-the Commodoreohad heard the un- wonted cry, and now, raised upon his elbow, lay staring at her with his great fat eyes, and insisting upon knowing-What the foul fiend she meant by screeching out in that manner? It was in vain to evade the question-the Commodore would hear the news. And Mrs. Waugh told him. "And by the bones of Paul Jones, I always' believed it 1" falsely swore the Commodore; and thereupon he demanded to hear " all about it." Mrs. Waugh commenced, and in a very unsteady voice read the long account quite through. The Commodore made no comment, except an occasional -grunt of satisfaction, until she had finished it, when he growled out, "Knew it!-hope they'Il hang him Hd-d rascal! If it hadn't been for him, there'd been no trouble in the family I now call Festus to help to turn me over, and tuck me up, Hen- rietta; I want to go to sleep!" That night Mrs. Waugh said nothing, but the next morning she proposed hurrying homeward with all possible speed.( But the Commodore would hear of no such thing.@ Hoe swore roundly that he would not stir to save the necks of all the scoundrels in the world, much less that of Thurston,:vho if he did not kill Marian, deserved richly to be -hanged'- for' giving poor Nace so much trouble.  &#xD;<pb n="614-615" xml:id="VAC7871-00000300"/> "4      THE    MSSING    BRI/DS. Mrs. Waugh coaxed and argued in vain.   The Commodore rather liked to hear her do so, and so the longer she pleaded, the more obstinate and dogged hp grew, until at last Henrietta desisted--telling him, Very well H-justice and humanity alike required her presence near the unhappy man, and so, whether the Commodore chose to budge or not, she should surely leave Charleston in that very evening's boat for Baltimore, so as to reach Leonardtown in time for the trial.  Upon hearing this, the Commodore swore furiously; but knowing of old that nothing could turn Henrietta from the' path of duty, and dreading above all things to lose her comfortable attentions, and  be left to the doubtful mercies of Mary L'Oiseau,-he yielded, though with the worst possible grace, swearing all the time-that he hoped the villain would swing for it yet. And then the trunks were packed, and the travellers re- sumed their homeward journey. CHAPTER XLV. THE TRIAL. "'Through night to dayl When sullen darkness lowers, And heaven and earth are hid from sight, Cheer up I cheer up I Ere long the opening flowers, With dewy eyes, shall shine in light, Through stormto calm! When over land and ocean Roll the loud chariots of the wind,  Cheer up Cheer up! The voice of wild commotion Proclaims tranquility at hand."-MJlfotgomery. THE day of the trial came. It was a bright spring day, and from an early hour in the, morning the village was crowded to overflowing with people collected from all parts of the county.   THE  TRIAL.          63!5 The court-room was filled to suffocation. It was with the greatest difficulty that order could be maintained when the prisoner, in the custody of the high sheriff, was brought into court. The venerable presiding judge was supposed to be unfriendly to the accused, and the state's attorney was known to be per- sonally, as well as officially, hostile to his interests. So strongly were the minds of the people prejudiced, upon one side or the other, that it was with much trouble twelve men could be found who had not mads up their opinions as to the prisoner's inno- cence or guilt. At length, however, a jury was empaneled, and the trial comimenced. When the prisoner was placed a t' the bar, and asked the usual question, "Guilty or Not Guilty?" some of the old haughtiness curled the lip and flashed from the eye of Thurston Willcoxen, as though he disdained to answer a charge so base; and he replied in a-low, scornful tone, "Not Guilty, your honor." The opening charge of the state's attorney had been carefully prepared. Mr. Thomson had never in his life had so important a case upon his hainds, and he was resolved to make the most of it. His speech was well reasoned, logical, eloquent. To destroy in the minds of the jury every favorable impression left by the late blameless and beneficent life of Mr. Willcoxen, he did not fail to adduce, from olden history, and from later times, every signal instance of depravity, cloaked with hypocrisy, in high places; he enlarged upon wolves in sheep's clothing- Satan in an angel's garb, and dolefully pointed out how many times the indignant question of.-"Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this thing?"--hald been answered by results in the affirmative. He raked up David's sin from the ashes of ages. Where was the scene of that crime, and who was its perpetfator -in the court of Israel, by the King of Israel-a man after God's own heart. Could the gentlemen of the jury be sur- prised at the appalling discovery so recently made, as if great crimes in high places were impossible or new things under the sun? He did not fail to draw a touching picture of the victimi  &#xD;<pb n="616-617" xml:id="VAC7871-00000301"/> "6     THE  MSSIXN    BERIDE. the beautiful young stranger-girl, whom they all remembered and loved-who had come, an angel of mercy, on a mission of mercy, to their shores. Was not Iher beauty, her genius, her goodness, by which all there had at some time been blessed- sufficient to save her from the knife of the assassin?-No I as he should shortly prove. Yet all these years her innocent blood had cried to Heaven in vain; her fate was unavenged, her manes unappeased. All the women, and all the simple-hearted and unworldly among the men, were melted into tears, very unpropitious to the fate of Thurston ; tears not called -up by the eloquence of the prosecuting attorney, so much as by the mere allusion to the fate of Marian, once so beloved, and still so fresh in the memo- ries of all. Thurston heard all this--not in the second-hand style with which I have summed it up--but in the first vital freshness, when it was spoken with a logic, force, and fire, that carried conviction to many a mind. Thurston looked upon the judge --his face was stern and grave. Hle looked upon the jury- they were all strangers; from distant parts of the county, drawn by idle curiosity to the scene of trial, and arriving quite unpre- judiced. They were not his t'peers," but, on the contrary, twelve-as stolid-looking brothers as ever decided the fate of a gentleman and scholar. Thence he cast his eyes over the crowd in the court-room. There were his parishioners I hoary patriarchs and gray-haired matrons, stately men and lovely women, who, from week to week, for many years, had still hung delighted on his discourses, as though his lips had been touched with fire, and all his words inspired I There they were around him again But oh I how different the relations and the circumstances I There they sat, with stern brows and averted faces, or downcast eyes, and "Iips that scarce their scorn forbore."  No eye or lip among them responded kindly to his searching gaze--and Thurston turned his face away again--for an instant his soul sank under the pall of despair that fell darkening upon it. It was not con-   THE  TRIAL.         .617- viction in the court he thought of-he would probably be ac- quitted by the court-but what should acquit him in public opinion? The evidence that- might not be strong enough to doom him to death, would still be sufficient to destroy forever his position and his usefulness. No eye thenceforth would meet his own in friendly confidence. No hand grasp his in brotherly fellowship. The state's attorney was still proceeding with his speech. He was now- stating the case, which he promised to prove by competent witnesses-how the prisoner at the bar had long pursued his beautiful but hapless victim-how he-had been united to her by a private marriage-that he had corresponded with her from Europe-that upon his return they had frequently met--that the prisoner, with the treachery that would soon be proved to be a part of his nature, had grown weary of his wife, and transferred his attentions to another and more fortunle- favored lady-and finally, that upon the evening of the murder he had decoyed the unhappy young lady to the fatal spot, and then and there effected his purpose. The prosecuting attorney made this statement, not with the brevity with which it is here reported, but with a minuteness of detail and warmth of coloring that harrowed up the hearts of all who heard it. He finished by saying that he should carll the witnesses in the order of time corresponding with the, facts tey came to prove. "Oliver Murray will take the-stand." This, the first witness called, after the usual oath, deposed that he had first seen the prisoner and the deceased together in the Library of Congress; had overheard their conversation, and suspecting some unfairness on the part of the prisoner, had followed the parties to the navy-yard, where he had witnessed their marriage ceremony. "When was the next occasion upon which you saw the prisoner?" "On the night of the 8th of April, 182-, on the coast, near Pine Bluff. I had landed from a boat, and was going inland' when I passed him. I did not see his face distinctly, but retog- "*  &#xD;<pb n="618-619" xml:id="VAC7871-00000302"/> "8     THE   MSSING   BRIDE. nized him by his size and form, and peculiar air and gait. IBe ,was hurrying away, with every mark of terror and agitation." This portion of Mr. Murray's testimony was so new to all, -as to excite the greatest degree of surprise, and in no bosom did it arouse more astonishment than in that of Thurston. The witness was strictly cross-questioned by the counsel for the prisoner, but the eross-examination failed to weaken his testi- mony, or to elicit anything more favorable to the accused. Oliver Murray was then directed to stand aside. The next witness was Miriam Shields. Deeply veiled and half fainting, the poor girl was led in between Colonel and Miss Thornton, and allowed to sit while giving evidence. When told to look at the prisoner at the bar, she raised her death- like face, and a deep, gasping sob broke from her bosom. But Thurston fixed his eyes kindly and encouragingly upon her- his look said plainly--"Fear nothing, dear Miriam I Be cou- rageous! do your stern duty, and trust in God." Miriam then identified the prisoner as the man she had twice seen alone with Marian at night. She farther testified, that upon the night of April 8th, 182, Marian had left home late in the evening to keep an appointment-from which she had never returned. That in the pocket of the dress she had laid off, was found the note appointing the meeting upon the beach for the night in question. Here the note was produced. Miriam identified the handwriting as that of Mr. Willcoxen. Paul Douglass was next called to the stand, and required to give his testimony in regard to the handwriting. Paul looked at the piece of paper that was placed before him, and he was sorely tempted. How could he swear to the handwriting unless he had actually seen the hand write it? he asked himself. He looked at his brother. But Thurston saw the struggle in his mind, and his countenance was stern and high, and his look authoritative and commanding-it said-"'Paul! do not dare to deceive yourself. You know the handwriting. Speak the truth if it kill me." And Paul did so. The next witness that took the stand was Dr. Brightwell-   THE  TRIAL.          619' the good old physician gave his evidence very reluctantly-it went to prove the fact of the prisoner's absence from the death-; bed of his grandfather upon the night of the reputed murder, and his distracted appearance when returning late in the morning. "Why do you say reputed murder?"  "Because, sir, I never consider the fact of a murder estab- lished, until the body of the victim has been found." "You may stand down." Dr. Solomon Weismann was next called to the stand, and corroborated the testimony of the last witness. Several other witnesses were then called in succession, whose' testimony being only corroborative, was not very important. And the prisoner was remanded, and the court adjourned untilt ten o'clock the next morning.  : "Life will be saved, but position and usefulness in this neighborhood gone forever, Paul," said Thurston, as they went out. "Evidence very strong-very conclusive to our minds, yet not sufficient to convict him," said one gentleman to another. "I am of honest Dr. Brightwell's opinion-that the estab- lishment of a murder needsas a starting point the finding of' the body; and moreover, that the conviction of a murderer requires an eye-witness to thebdeed. The evidence, so far as we have heard it, is 'strong enough to ruin the man, but not strong enough to hang him," said a third. "Aye 1 but we have not heard all, or the most important part of the testimony. The state's attorney has not fired his' great gun yet," said a fourth, as the crowd elbowed, pushed, and struggled out of the court-room. Those from distant parts of the county remained in the vil- lage all night-those nearer returned home to come back in the morning. The second day of the trial, the village was more--crowded than before. At ten o'clock the court opened, the prisoner was shortly afterwards brought in, and the prosecution renewed  &#xD;<pb n="620-621" xml:id="VAC7871-00000303"/> 620     THE   MSSING   BRIDE. its examination of witnesses. The next witness that took the stand was a most important one. John Miles, captain of the schooner Plover. . He deposed that in the month of April, 182-, he v as mate in the schooner Blanch,- of which his father was the captain. That in said month the prisoner at the bar had hired his father's vessel to carry off a lady whom the prisoner declared to be his own wife; that they were to take her to the Bermudas. That to effect their object, his father and himself had landed near Pine Bluff; the night was dark, yet he soon discerned the lady walking alone upon the beach. They were bound to wait for the arrival of the prisoner, and a signal from him, before approaching the lady. They waited some time, watching from their cover the lady as she paced impatiently up and down the sands. At length they saw the prisoner-ap- proaching. He was closely wrapped up in his cloak, and his hat was pulled over his eyes, but they recognized him well by his air and gait. They drew nearer still, keeping in the shadow, waiting for the signal. The lady and the prisoner met-a few words passed between them-of which he, the depxcoent, only heard "Thurston?"  "Yes, Thurston P" and then the prisoner raised his arm and struck, and the lady fell. His father was a cautious man, and when he saw the prisoner rush up the cliff and disappear, that the lady was dead, and that the storm was beginning to rage violently and the tide was coming in, and fearing, besides, that he should get into trouble, he hurried into the boat and put off and boarded the schooner, and as soon as possible set sail for Bermuda. They had kept away from this coast for years, that is to say, as long as the father lived. John Miles was cross-examined by Mr. Romford, but without effect. This testimony bore fatally upon the prisoner's cause-the silence of consternation reigned through the crowd. Thurston Willcoxen, when he heard this astounding evidence, first thought that the witness was perjured, but when he looked 1osely upon his open, honest face, :and fearless eye and free bearing, he saw that no consciousness of falsehood was there   THE   TRIAL.         621 and he could but grant that the witness, naturally deceived by "foregone conclusions," had'inevitably mistaken the real mur- derer for himself. Darker and darker lowered the pall of fate over him--the awful stillness of -the court was oppressive, was suffocating; a deathly faintness came upon him, for now, for the first time, he fully realized the awful doom that threatened him. Not long his nature bowed under the burden-his spirit rose to throw it off, and once more the fine head was proudly raised, nor did it once sink again. The last witness for the prosecution was now called and took the stand, and deposed that he lived ten miles down the coast in an isolated, obscure place; that on the first of May, 182-, the body of a woman had been found at low tide upon the beach, that it had the appearance of having been very long in the water-the clothing was respectable, the dress was dark blue stuff, but was faded in Spots-there was a ring on the finger, but the hand was so swollen that it could not be got off. His poor neighbors of the coast assembled. They made an effort to get the coroner, hut he could not be found. And the state of the body demanded immediate burial. When cross- questioned by Lawyer Romford, the witness said that they had not then heard of any missing or murdered lady, but had be- lieved the body to be that-of a shipwrecked passenger, until they heard of Miss Mayfield's fate. Miriam was next recalled. She came in as before, supported between Colonel and Miss Thornton. Every one who saw the poor girl, said that she was dying. When examined, she de- posed that Marian, when she left home, had worn a blue merino dress-and yes, she always wore a little locket ring on her finger. Drooping and fainting as she was, Miriam was allowed to leave the court-room. This closed the evidence of the pro- secution. The defence was taken up and conducted with a great deal of skill. Mr. Romford enlarged upon the noble character his client had ever maintained from childhood to the present time-- they all knew him-he had been born and had ever lived smong 39  &#xD;<pb n="622-623" xml:id="VAC7871-00000304"/> THE  MS ING   BRIDE. them--what man or woman of them all would have dared to suspect him of such a crime? he spoke warmly of his truth, fidelity, Christian zeal, benevolence, philanthropy and great public benefits. I have no space nor time to give a fair idea of the logic and eloquence with which Mr. Romford met the charges of the state's attorney, nor the astute skill with which he tried to break down the force of the evidence for the prosecution. Then he called the witnesses for the defence. -They were all warm friends of Mr. Willcoxen, all had known him from boy- nood, none would believe that under any possible circumstances he could commit the crime for which he stood indicted. They testified to his well-known kindness, gentleness and benevolence -his habitual forbearance and command of temper, even under the most exasperating provocations-they swore to his gene- rosity, fidelity and truthfulness in all the relations of life. In a word, they did the very best they could to save his life and honor--but the most they could do was very little before the force of such-evidence as stood arrayed against him. And all men saw, that unless an alibi could be proved, Thurston Will- eoxen was lost! Oh I for that alibi. Paul Douglass was again undergoing an awful temptation. Why, he asked himself-- why should he not perjure his soul, and lose it, too, to save his brother's life and honor from fatal wrong? And if there had got been in Paul's heart a love of truth greater than his fear of hell, his affection for Thurston would have triumphed, he would have perjured himself. The defence here closed. The state's attorney did not even deem it necessary to speak again, and the judge proceeded to charge the jury. They must not, he said, be blinded by the social position, clerical character, youth, talents, accomplish- ments or celebrity of the prisoner-with however dazzling a nalo these might surround him. They must deliberate coolly upon the evidence that had been laid before them, and after due consideration -of the case, if there was a doubt upon their minds, they were to let the prisoner have the full benefit of it.   Wherever there was the least uncertainty, it was right to lean to the side of mercy. The case was- then given to the jury. The jury did not leave their box, but counseled together in a low voice for half-an- hour, during which a death-like silence, a suffocating atmo- sphere filled the court-room. - Thurston alone was calm, his soul had collected all its forces to meet the shock of whatever fate might come-honor or dis- honor, life or death I Presently the foreman of the jury arose, followed by the others.                  I Every heart stood still. "Gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon your ver- diet?" demanded the judge. "Yes, your honor,' responded the foreman, on the part of  his colleagues.  "How say you--is the prisoner at the bar 'Guilty or Not Guilty?'" "NOT GUILTY," cried the shrill tones of a girl, near the 6uter door, towards which all eyes, in astonishment and inquiry, were a : now turned, to seea slight female figure, in the garb of a Sister  of Mercy, clinging to the arm of Cloudesley Mornington, and  who was now pushing and elbowing his way through the crowd,  towards the bench.                     ; All gave way-many that were seated arose to their feet, and ' spoke in eager whispers, or looked over each others' heads. :a "Order! silence in the court!" shouted the marshal.  * "Your honor-this lady is a vitally important witness for ! the defence," said Cloudy, pushing his way into the presence of  the judge, leaving his female companion standing before the bench, and then hurrying to the dock, where he grasped the  hand of the prisoner, exclaiming, breathlessly, "Saved--Thurs- ton  Saved"I'  "Order I silence!" called out the marshal, by way of making himself agreeable-for there was silence in the court, where all the audience at least were more anxious to hear than to -speak.  &#xD;<pb n="624-625" xml:id="VAC7871-00000305"/> Your honor, I move that the new witness be heard," said Mr. Romford. The defence is closed--the charge given to the jury, who have decided upon their verdict," answered the state's attorney. "The verdict has not been rendered, the jury have the pri. vilege of hearing this new witness," said the judge. The jury were unanimous in the resolution to withhold their verdict until they had heard. This being decided, the Sister of Mercy took the stand, threw aside her long, black veil, and revealed' the features of Jacquelina; but so pale, weary, anxious and terrified, as to be scarcely recognizable. The usual oath was administered. And while Cloudy stood triumphantly by the side of Mr. Willcoxen, Jacquelina prepared to give in her evidence. She was interrupted by a slight disturbance near the door,- and the rather noisy entrance of several persons, whom the crowd, on beholding, recognized as Commodore Waugh, his wife, his niece, and his servant. Some among them seemed to - insist upon being brought directly into the-presence of the judge and jury-but the officer near the door pointed out to them the witness on the stand, waiting to give testimony; and on seeing her they subsided into quietness, and suffered them- selves to be set aside for a while. When this was over-a lady, plainly dressed, and close-veiled, entered, and addressed a few words to the same janitor. But the latter replied as he had to the others, by pointing to the witness on the stand. The veiled lady seemed to acquiesce, and sat down where the officer directed her. "Order I silence in the court," cried the marshal, not to be behindhand.  And order and silence reigned when the Sister gave in her evidence as follows: "My name is Jacquelina L'Oiseau-not Grimshaw-fo  r I never was the wife of Dr. Grimshaw.

After he was gone, Marian chanced to drop a note, which I picked up and read. It was in the hand- writing of Thurston Willcoxen, and it appointed a meeting with Marian upon the beach, near Pine Bluff, for that evening. Here Mr. Romford placed in her hands the scrap of paper that had already formed such an important part of he evidence against the prisoner.  "Is that the note of which you speaka?"   I    - ,' Yes--that is the note. And when I picked it up the wan- an spirit of mischief inspired -me with the wish to use it for" the tormentt of Dr. Grimshaw, whowas easily provoked to jealousy!

He dropped the note where'he had picked it up, and pretended not to have seen it; afterwaret I in the same way restored it to Marian.

May I now sit down?" No I the states attorney wanted to take her in hand, and cross-examine her, which he began to do severely, unsparingly. But as she had told the exact truth, though not in the clearest style, the more the lawyer sifted her testimony, the clearer and more evident its truthfulness and point became; until there seemed at length nothing to do but acquit the prisoner. But courts of law are proverbially fussy, and now the state's attor- ney was doing his best to invalidate the testimony of the last witness.

In the meantime, near the bench, the counsel for the priso- ner had succeeded in establishing the validity of the challenged testimony, and the case was once more about to be recommitted to the jury, when the lady, who had been quietly m aking her way through the crowd towards the bench, stood immediately in front of the judge, raised her veil, and' Marian Mayfied stood revealed. With a loud cry the prisoner sprang upon his feet; bt was- immediately captured by two officers, who faneiedhe was about to escape. l arian did not speak one word, she could not do so , nor was it necessary-there she stood alive amongthem--they all knew her-the judge, the officers, the lawyers, the audience- there she stood alive among them-it was enough I The  audience arose on a mass, and "Marian]" tariafi Mayfield I!" was theger HMayfield " was the general exclamation, as all pressed towards the newcomer.

How he met that look-how he clasped that hand-need not be said--their-hearts were too full for speech. The tumult in the court-room was at length subdued by the rising of thejudge-to make a speech-a very brief one- "Mr. Willcoxen is discharged, and the court adjourned," and then the judge came down from his seat, and the officers cried, "make way for the court to pass." And the way was made. The judge came up to to the group, and shbook hands first with Mr. Willcoxen, whom he earnestly congratulated, and then with Marian, 'who was an old and esteemed acquaint- ance, and so bowing gravely, he passed out. Still the crowd pressed on, and among them came Commo- dore Waugh and his family, for whom way was immediately made.. Mrs. Waugh wept and smiled, and exclaimed: "Oh I Hebe I Oh I Lapwing!" The Commodore growled out certain inarticulate anathemas, which he intended should be taken as congratulations, since the people seemed to expect it of him. And Mary L'Oiseau pulled down her mouth, cast up her eyes, and Crossed herself when she saw the consecrated hand of Sister Theresa clasped in that of Cloudy! But Thurston's high spirit could not brook this scene an in- stant longer. And love as well as pride required its speedy close. Marian was resting on his arm-he felt the clasp of her dear hand-he saw her living face-the angel brow-the clear eyes-the rich auburn tresses, rippling around the blooming cheek-he heard her dulcet tones-yet-it seemed too like a dream I1-he needed to realize this happiness.

But you must all know how exhausting this day has been, and how needful repose is "-his eyes here fell  fondly and proudly upon Marian-"to this lady on my arm! Aft er to-morrow we shall be 'happy to see any of our friend s at Dell-Delight." And bowing slightly from right to left, he led his Marian through the opening crowd. CHAPTER XLVI. REUNION. "O1 my soul's joy  If after every tempest come such calms t My soul hath her content so absolute, That not another comfort like to this Sacceeds in unknown fate.'--hctkspeare Wro shall follow them, or intrude on the sacredness of their reconciliation, or relate with what broken tones, and frequent stops and tears and smiles, and clinging embraces, their mutual explanations were made? At last Marian, raising her head from his shoulder, said, "But I come to you a bankrupt, dear Thurston I I have in- herited and expended a large fortune since we parted-and now I am more than penniless, for I stand responsible for large sums of money owed by my ' Orphans' Rome' and 'Emigrants' Help'-money that I had intended to raise by subscription." P "Now, I thank God abundantly for the wealth that He has given me. Your fortune, dearest Marian, has been nobly ap- propriated-and for the rest, it is my blessed privilege to assume all your responsibilities-and I rejoice that they are great, for, sweetest wife, and fairest lady, I feel that I never can suffciently prove how much I love and reverence you-how much I would and ought to sacrifice for you 1" "And even now, dear Thurston, I came hither,bound on a mission to the western prairies, to find a suitable piece of land for a colony of emigrants." 52*  ,  '  &#xD;<pb n="630-631" xml:id="VAC7871-00000308"/> 630      THE   MSSING    BR IDE. aI know it, fairest and dearest lady, I know it all. I will lift that burden from your shoulders, too, and all liabilities of yours do I assume--oh I my dear Marian I with how much joy! and I will labor with and for you, until all your responsibilities of every sort are discharged, and my liege lady is free to live her own life!" This scene took place in the private parlor of the hotel, while Paul Douglass was gone to Colonel Thornton's lodgings, to carry the glad tidings to Miriam, and also to procure a carriage for the conveyance of the whole party to Dell-Delight. He returned at last, accompanied by Miriam, whom he ten- derly: conducted into the room, and who, passing by all others, tottered forward, and sank, weeping, at the feet of Mr. Will- coxen, and clasping his knees, still wept, as if her heart would break. Thurston stooped and raised her, pressed the kiss of forgive- ness on her young brow, and then whispering, "Miriam, have you forgotten that there is another here who v claims your attention?" took her by the hand, and led her to Marian. The young girl was shy and silent, but Marian drew her to her bosom, saying, "tHas my 'baby' forgotten me? And so, you would have been an avenger, Miriam. Remember, all your life, dear child, i that such an office is never to be assumed by an erring human creature. Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, saith thee Lord.' " And kissing Miriam fondly, she resigned her to Paul's care, and turned, and gave her own hand to Thurston, who conducted her to the carriages and then returned for little Angel, who all this time had sat demurely in a little parlor chair. They were followed by Paul and Miriam, and so set forth for Dell-Delight. But little more remains to be told. Thurston resigned his pastoral charge of the village church; -settled up his business in the neighborhood; procured a discreet woman to keep house at Dell-Delight; left Paul, Miriam ind   RE U N I  o .         681 poor Fanny in her care, and set out with Marian, on their west- era journey, to select the site 'for the settlement of her emigrant proteges. After successfully accomplishing this mission, they returned east, and embarked for Liverpool, and thence to Lon- don, where Marian dissolved her connection with the "Emi- grant's Help," and bade adieu to her!'Orphans' Home." Thurston made large donations to both these institutions. And Marian saw that her place was well supplied to the!"Orphans' Home" by another competent woman. Then they returned to America. Their travels had occupied more than twelve months. And their expenses, of all sorts, had absorbed more than a third of Mr. Willcoxen's princely fortune-yet with what joy was it lavished by his hand, who felt he could not do too muchfor his priceless Marian. On their return home, a heartfelt gratification met them-it was that. the parish had shown theirfundiminished confidence in Mr. Willcoxen, and their high appreciation of his services, by keeping his pulpit open for him. And a few days after his settlement at home, a delegation of the vestry waited upon him, to solicit his acceptance of the ministry. And after talking with his " liege lady," as he fondly and proudly termed Marian, Mr.; Willcoxen was well pleased to return a favorable answer. And in a day or two Thurston and Marian were called upon to give decision in another cause, to wit :- Jacquelina had not returned to Bethlehem, nor renewed her vows; but had doffed her nun's habit for E young lady's dress, and remained at Luckenough. Clondy had not failed to push his suit with all his might. But Jacquelina still hesitated--she did not know, she said, but she thought she had no right to be happy, as other people had, she had caused so much trouble ite.  the world, she reckoned she had better go back to her convent. "And because you unintentionally occasioned some Sorrow, now happily over, to some people, you would atone for the fault by adding one more to the list of victims, and making me miserable. Bad logic, Lina, and worse religion." Jacquelina did not know-she could not decide-after so ,   &#xD;<pb n="632-633" xml:id="VAC7871-00000309"/> many grave errors, she was afraid to trust herself. The matter was then referred-of all men in the world, to the-Commodore, who graciously replied, that 'they might all go to the demon for him.  But as Cloudy and Lina had no especial business with his Satanic Majesty, they declined to avail themselves of the permission, and consulted Mrs. Waugh, whose deep, mellow laugh preceded her answer, when she said, " Take heart, Lapwing ! take heart, and all the happiness you can possibly get! I have lived a long time, and seen a great many people, good and bad, and though I have sometimes met i people who were not so happy as they merited-yet I never have seen any one happier than they deserved to be ! and that they cannot be so, seems to be a law of nature that ought to reconcile us very much to the apparent flourishing of the wicked." But Mrs. L'Oiseau warned her daughter not to trust to "Aunty," who was so good natured, and altogether such a mis- guided woman, that if she had her will she would do away with all punishment-yes, even with Satan and purgatory I But Jacquelina had much less confidence in Mrs. L'Oiseau than in Mrs. Waugh; and so she told Cloudy, who thought that he had waited already quite long enough, to wait until Marian and Thurston came home, and if they thought it would be right for her to be happy-why-then-maybe-she might be ! But the matter must be referred to them. And now it was referred to them, by the sorely tried Cloudy. And they gave Jacquelina leave to be " happy."  And she was happy I And as for Cloudy, poor, constant fellow I he was so overjoyed, that he declared he would petition the Legislature to change his name as no longer appropriate, for though his morn- ing had been cloudy enough, his day was going to be a very bright one l When Mrs. L'Oiseau heard of this engagement, she crossed herself, and told her beads, and vowed that the world was grow- ing so wicked, that she could no longer live in it. And she commenced preparations to retire to a convent, to which in fact   REUNION.             too she soon after went, and where, in strict truth, she was likely to be much happier than her nature would permit her to be elsewhere.    ,             i Cloudy and Lina were very quietly married, and took up their abode at the pleasant farm-house of Locust Hill, which was re- paired and refurnished for their reception. But if the leopard cannot change his spots, nor the Ethiope his skin-neither can the fairy permanently change her nature; for no sooner was Jacko's happiness secured, than the elfish spirit, the lightest  part of her nature, effervesced to the top-for the torment of Cloudy. Jacko and Cloudy even had one quarrel-it was upon the first occasion after their marriage, of his leaving her to join his ship--and when the whilome sister of charity drove Cloudy nearly frantic by insisting--whether in jest or earnest no one on earth could tell-upon donning the little middy's uniform and going with him I However, the quarrel happily was never renewed, for before the next time of sailing, there appeared a certain tiny Cloudy at home, that made the land quite as dear as the sea to its mother. And this-little imp became Mrs. Waugh's especial pet. And if Jacquelina did not train the little scion very straight, at least she did not twist him awry. And she even tried, in her fitful capricious way, to reform her own manners, that she might form those of her little children. And Mrs. Waugh and dear Marian aided her and encouraged - her in her uncertain efforts. About this time, Paul and Miriiam were united, and went to housekeeping in the pretty villa built for them upon the site of Old Field Cottage by Thurston, and furnished for them by Mrs. Waugh.         .             X And a very pleasant country neighborhood they formed- these three young families-of Dell-Delight, Locust Hill, and the villa. Two other important events occurred in their social circle- first, poor harmless Fanny passed smilingly to her heavenly home, and all thought it very well.:  And one night Commodore Waugh. after eating a good ^ ,'  &#xD;<pb n="634-635" xml:id="VAC7871-00000310"/> hearty supper, was comfortably tucked up in bed, and went into a sound, deep sleep from which he never more awoke. May he rest in peace. But do you think Mrs. Waugh did not cry about it for two weeks, and ever after speak of him as the poor. dear Commodore? But Henrietta was of too healthful a nature to break her heart for the loss of a very good man, and it was not likely she was going to do so for the missing of a very uncomfortable one; and so in a week or two more her happy spirits returned, 'and she began to realize to what freedom, ease, and cheerfulness she had fallen heir! Now she could live and breathe, and go and come without molestation. Now when she wished to open her generous heart to the claims of affection in the way of help- ing "Lapwing" or Miriam, who were neither, of them very rich-or to the greater claims of humanity in the relief of the suffering poor, or the pardon of delinquent servants, she could do so to her utmost content, and without having to accompany her kind act with a deep sigh at the anticipation of the parlor storm it would raise at home. And though Mrs. Henrietta still "waxed fat," her good flesh was no longer an incumbrance to her-the leaven of cheerfulness lightened the whole mass. Mrs. Waugh had brought her old maid Jenny back. Jenny ,had begged to come home to "old mistess," for she said it was "'stonishin' how age-able," she felt, though nobody might be- lieve it, she- was "gettin' oler and oler, ebery singly day" of her life, and she wanted to end her days "'long o' ole mistess." Old mistress was rich and good, and Luckenough was a quiet, comfortable home, where the old maid was very sure of being lodged, boarded, and clothed almost as well as old mistress herself-not that these selfish considerations entered largely into Jenny's mind, for she really loved Mrs. Henrietta. And old mistress and old maid were never happier than on some fine, clear day, when seated on their two old mules, they ambled along through forest and over field, to spend a day with "Lapwing" or with "Hebe"'-or perhaps with the "Pigeon Pair," as they called the new married couple at the villa.   4   REUNION.     Yes there was a time when Mrs. Henrietta was happier still It was, when upon some birthday or other festival, she would gather all the young families-Thurston and Hebe,  Cloudy and Lapwing, the Pigeons, and all the babies, in the big parlor of Luckenough, and sit surrounded by a flock of tiny lapwings, hebes and pigeons, forming a group that our fairy saucily called, "The old hen and chickens." And what shall we say in taking leave of Thurston and Ma- rian? He had had some faults, as you have seen-but the conquering of faults is the noblest conquest, and he had achieved such a victory. He called Marian the angel of his salva- tion. Year by year their affection deepened and strengthened, and drew them closer in heart and soul and purpose. From their home. as from a centre emanated a healthful, beneficent  and elevating influence, happily felt through all their social circle. A lovely family grew around them-and among the beautiful children, none were more tenderly nursed or carefully trained, than the little waif Angel. And in all the pleasant country neighborhood, the sweetest and the happiest home is that of Dell-Delight. THE END.  &#xD;</p>
