               <p>A DESIRE to study the undercurrents of popular sentiment at the South, and to meet
                  some of "my Southern friends," whom the fortunes of war had made our prisoners
                  within sight of their homes, led me, early in the month of May, to visit the
                  Southwest. While there I came in contact with many intelligent men, of all shades
                  of political opinion; and from them gathered much that is illustrative of the real
                  state of Southern feeling, and of the real purposes of the leaders of the
                  Rebellion. In the hope that what I saw and heard may not be without interest to
                  those who have not had the opportunity of personal observation, I propose to give
                  in the following chapters some sketches of the men I met, and the scenes I
                  witnessed, during a month's sojourn in a section which is being upheaved by the
                  passions and desolated by the fires of our civil war.</p>
               <p>Arriving at Louisville I at once sought out Colonel Mundy, the gentlemanly
                  commandant of that post, to ascertain the whereabouts of my captive friends. He
                  could give me no definite information, but presumed they were at Nashville.
                  "However," he said, "prisoners are not kept there long. They<pb n="10-11"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000006"/> are sent to Vicksburg for exchange as quickly as
                  possible. If you desire to see them, you had better push on immediately."</p>
               <p>This put me in a dilemma. The railroad below Bowling Green was infested with
                  guerillas, and on several recent occasions, they had assailed the trains, and
                  robbed and maltreated passengers. The cars were insufficiently guarded, and
                  travelling was therefore attended with considerable personal hazard. In these
                  circumstances I had gladly listened to the suggestion of Parson Brownlow—whom I
                  had met at Cincinnati—to lie over at Louisville and accompany him and Governor
                  Johnson to Nashville. They would be attended by a guard strong enough to beat off
                  any roving band that ventured to attack the train; but would, perhaps, not start
                  for a week. In the mean time, my Secession friends might be sent to "parts
                  unknown." Therefore, if I waited, I was likely to miss one of the main objects of
                  my journey, and if I went forward I ran the risk of getting a bullet under my
                  waistcoat, or such an "inside view" of Rebeldom as might not be agreeable. Either
                  horn of the dilemma seemed objectionable. While uncertain which one to choose, the
                  small clock in the office of the Louisville Hotel sounded twice, and I walked up
                  to the dining-room.</p>
               <p>On my right at the table sat a tall, squarely built man, wearing the uniform of a
                  lieutenant-colonel of infantry. He had a broad, open, resolute face—ridged and
                  sun-browned, and a stiff, military air, but there was something about him that
                  seemed to invite conversation, and after a while I said to him:</p>
               <p>"You are travelling, Sir?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir, I am returning to my regiment at Triune."</p>
               <p>"Is it entirely safe going down the Nashville road?</p>
               <p>"Not entirely so. When I came up, a week ago Monday, we were fired into by a band
                  of forty-eight, but we beat them off."</p>
               <p>"What were the circumstances?"</p>
               <p>"It occurred just this side of Franklin. We heard there of a party being in the
                  vicinity, and took on board a squad of thirty men. We had gone on about three
                  miles, when the engineer discovered the track was torn up, where a wood lines the
                  road, and at once reversed the engine. The guerillas were posted behind the trees,
                  and as the train halted, poured a volley into us, and, yelling like devils, made a
                  rush for the cars. I got this in readiness"—taking from his belt a large army
                  repeater, and tapping it rather affectionately—"the moment I heard the train
                  slacking-up, and when the leader came within fifteen feet of the platform I fired
                  through the window and killed him. My second shot brought the next devil to his
                  knees, and made the rest halt for an instant. In that instant the soldiers in the
                  forward car, who had waited to cap their muskets, gave them a volley, and they
                  skedaddled, leaving four dead and three wounded on the ground. We had on board
                  three paymasters with over four hundred thousand dollars in money, and the fellows
                  might have made a rich haul."</p>
               <p>"And they would have done so but for your prompt shots giving the soldiers time to
                  fire. You saved the train!"</p>
               <p>"No, Sir," replied the Colonel, pleasantly, as if not displeased with my
                  compliment, "the <emph>General</emph> saved it."</p>
               <p>"How so? Was Rosecrans on board?"</p>
               <p>"No; but a little while ago he ordered all officers to wear side-arms when off
                  duty. But for that my pistol would have been in my valise; for it's a nuisance to
                  carry ten pounds of iron all the while dangling at your side. The General
                     foresaw<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6527-00000007"/> just such emergencies. He
                  thinks of every thing, Sir. I reckon he never sleeps."</p>
               <p>"I suppose he <emph>is</emph> a vigilant officer."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir; I was all through the Mexican war, and have seen something of generals.
                  Rosecrans is the ablest one I ever knew."</p>
               <p>"He certainly is successful."</p>
               <p>"Always; never was defeated, and never will be. He planned and won McClellan's
                  battles in Western Virginia; did the same for Grant in Mississippi, and at Stone
                  River—why, Sir, when we were thoroughly whipped, and every man in the army knew
                  it, he, singly, regained the battle. There is not another man living who could
                  have done it."</p>
               <p>This was said with an enthusiasm that provoked a smile; but I quietly remarked: "I
                  am glad to hear such an account of him. I intend to visit him, but am undecided
                  whether to go down at once, or to wait till the Governor arrives, and take
                  advantage of his escort."</p>
               <p>"It will be safer to go at once. The Governor will stay here a day or two, and as
                  this place is full of rebels, every guerilla in Tennessee will know when he
                  starts. If they can muster strong enough they'll surely attack him. I go down by
                  the next train, and will be glad to have your company."</p>
               <p>"Thank you. Your revolver has acquitted itself so well, that I am disposed to
                  trust it. I'll go with you, Sir;" and rising, we left the table together.</p>
               <p>The cars were not to start till the following morning, and the afternoon being on
                  our hands, we seated ourselves in the smoking room, and resumed the conversation.
                  I soon gleaned something of the Colonel's history. He had started in life with
                  only a clear head and a strong pair of hands, but was then the owner of a
                  well-stocked farm of three hundred and twenty acres, and in affluent
                  circumstances. His experience in Mexico had given him a military education, and on
                  the breaking out of the war, Governor Morton tendered him a colonel's commission.
                  Having a young family growing up about him, and being past the age when love of
                  adventure lures men into danger, he declined it. But when the new regiments were
                  called for, and it seemed doubtful that his county would furnish her quota, he
                  volunteered, to set, as he said, "the boys an example." His regiment, the 82d
                  Indiana, at once filled up, and he was appointed its lieutenant-colonel. He had
                  been in many small engagements, and at Stone River was in command of the six
                  hundred skirmishers who, at the close of the last day's fight, in the darkness of
                  midnight, advanced two miles, and for three hours "felt" a hostile force of five
                  thousand. So long as the West sends such men to the war, the friends of the Union
                  may be of good heart, for they cannot be beaten.</p>
               <p>After a time the conversation turned upon politics, and my new acquaintance said
                  to me: "A large majority of Rosecrans's men went into the war friendly to slavery;
                  but not one of them would now consent to any peace that did not destroy it root
                  and branch. Nine months ago I left home a Breckinridge Democrat, and now, sir, I'm
                  as black an Abolitionist as Wendell Phillips."</p>
               <p>"And what, pray, turned you about so suddenly?"</p>
               <p>"Seeing slavery <emph>as it is.</emph> One little incident convinced me that a
                  negro is a man—just as much of one as I am—and therefore not fit to be a slave. It
                  occurred at Triune, where I am now stationed. Just outside of our lines lives a<pb
                     n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6527-00000008"/> planter who professes strong Union
                  sentiments. He used to mix freely with our officers, keep open house for them, and
                  was, apparently, a whole-souled, hospitable fellow. He owned a good many negroes,
                  and among them a quiet, respectable old darky of about sixty, who supplied my mess
                  with eggs and poultry. Not long ago our pickets, stationed about one hundred yards
                  from this planter's house, were fired upon several times from the woods near by.
                  It was done regularly twice a week, and on each occasion occurred about two
                  o'clock in the morning. At last one of our boys was hit, and, being in command of
                  the pickets, I set about investigating the matter. There was nothing to point
                  suspicion at the planter, except the fact of his being a slaveholder, but
                     <emph>that</emph> convinced me he had a hand in it. I never knew one of them,
                  however strong his professions of loyalty, who was not at heart a rebel.</p>
               <p>"I sent for the old darky, to question him, and, learning of it, the planter came
                  to my quarters, and insisted that he had a right to hear what his negro said. I
                  was satisfied I couldn't get the truth out of the slave in the master's presence,
                  but I consented to go on with the examination. I put some leading questions to the
                  old man, and in a quiet, straightforward way he told me that an officer of Bragg's
                  army had been in the habit of visiting the mansion every few nights for several
                  weeks. He said he came about midnight, left his horse and orderly concealed in the
                  woods, and went up to the mistress's room as soon as he entered the house. There
                  the master would join him, and remain with him generally for an hour or two. And
                  he added, with perfect coolness: 'D'rec'ly af'er de cap'n wud leab, Sar, I'd
                  allers yere de shootin' 'mong de trees. I reckoned dat wus bery quar, till
                  finarly, one day, I yered Massa a tellin' Missus dat de Cap'n war bound to wing
                     <emph>one</emph> ob dem Yankees anyhow.' I asked him why the officer went
                  there, and the old fellow, scratching his wool, and assuming a very stupid look,
                  said:</p>
               <p>"'I doesn't knows, Cunnel. It allers 'peared bery quar ter me dat he shud come,
                  but I reckons de Secesh wants ter larn whot's gwine on in de camps. Massa, heseff,
                  wus allers bery curous 'bout dat, Sar, an' he sot me, ober an' ober agin, ter fine
                  out—tole me I muss keep my yeres wide open wheneber I toted you de truck; but, you
                  allers hab your moufh shet so bery close, Cunnel, dat I neber could fine out a
                  ting—not a ting, Sar.'"</p>
               <p>Here the Colonel burst into a fit of laughter. As soon as he could readjust the
                  muscles of his mouth to the English dialect, he continued:</p>
               <p>"Through the whole of this, the planter threatened him, and he finally stormed,
                  and raved at him like a madman, but the old Christian went on as quiet as a Quaker
                  meeting, only once in a while answering his master, with—'You knows it'm de Lord's
                  trufh, massa. I karn't say nuffin else, massa; I'se bery sorry, massa—'pears like
                  I'd die fur you, massa, 'case I toted you when you's a chile, an I'se allers lubed
                  you; but I karn't say nuffin else—de Lord woant leff me say nuffin else, massa.
                  No, He woant!'</p>
               <p>"The darky knew we might march at any moment, and that, when we did, there were
                  ninety-nine chances in a hundred of his being whipped to death by his master, or
                  by some of the neighbors, if his master wasn't left to do it; and yet he was as
                  cool as I am. Martin Luther, when he went into Worms, expecting to meet the devil
                  himself, didn't show the moral<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6527-00000009"/> courage of
                  that old negro. He convinced me that the black is altogether too much of a MAN to
                  be a slave."</p>
               <p>"And what did you do with the master?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing. Our Brigadier, who had been a frequent guest at his house, thought it
                  not exactly the thing to hang a white man on a 'nigger's' testimony, and so let
                  him off. If I had had my way, he would have hung higher than Haman."</p>
               <p>"And what became of the negro?"</p>
               <p>"Not many days after his master was released, he came to my tent one evening, and
                  with a little hesitation, said: 'Cunnel, I don't want ter 'sturb you, but de
                     <unclear>Lord</unclear> come ter me lass night, Sar, an' he telled me ter leff
                  you know what's a gwine on.'</p>
               <p>"And what is a going on?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"'Wall, you see, Cunnel, de debil hab got inter massa; an' he swar he'm gwine ter
                  kill me fur tellin' you 'bout de Secesh cap'n.'</p>
               <p>"I assured him I would protect him, and accordingly, in a day or two, I packed him
                  off, with his traps and family, to the Free States. It wasn't exactly according to
                  Tennessee law, and his owner protested warmly against it, but I advised him to
                  prove his loyalty and claim his property of Uncle Sam.</p>
               <p>"The old darky lived in a little log cabin near his master's house, and the day he
                  was to leave I rode out to see him safely off. His small amount of personal
                  property was stowed away in the ambulance, which was to take him to Nashville; and
                  his wife, a good-looking mulatto (the old fellow himself was blacker than ink) had
                  already mounted the wagon. A pretty quadroon woman of about thirty, who passed as
                  his daughter—though she couldn't have been of his blood—was helping on to the seat
                  one of the most beautiful white children I ever saw. She was well dressed, and had
                  a fair, clear, rosy skin, and an eye as blue as indigo. Supposing she was the
                  master's child, I asked her where she was going. 'Way up Norfh, massa, 'long wid
                  gran'dad,' she answered.</p>
               <p>"I was thunderstruck. She was the old woman's grandchild, the planter's own child,
                  and a <emph>slave!</emph> I never till then realized what an accursed thing
                  slavery is."</p>
               <p>While sauntering about the hotel during the day, I had noticed a placard which
                  read somewhat as follows:</p>
               <p>"Passengers for the Louisville and Nashville road are notified that the wagon will
                  be in readiness to take baggage to the Examiner's Office at four P. M."</p>
               <p>As this notice applied to us, I suggested, as the Colonel finished his story, that
                  we should repair to the "Custom House."</p>
               <p>We found it on a side street, a dingy room about twenty feet square. It was
                  densely crowded with carpet bags, portmanteaus, packing trunks, and a score of
                  German Israelites, each one of whom was soliciting the immediate attention of the
                  single examining official to the general assortment of dry goods and groceries
                  which his particular trunk contained. Another official was behind the counter
                  affixing to the "passed" packages, a strip of white muslin, and two mammoth daubs
                  of red sealing wax. The office was advertised to close at five o'clock, and it
                  then wanted but ten minutes of that hour. As our luggage could not leave the State
                  without having two of those red seals upon it, each duly stamped U. S., the
                  prospect of its going in the morning seemed decidedly dubious. With a little<pb
                     n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6527-00000010"/> inward trepidation, I said to the
                  coatless official: "Is there any probability of our turn coming this evening,
                  sir?"</p>
               <p>"Are you an 'Israelite indeed?'"</p>
               <p>"No, sir, neither in name nor in deed. <emph>I'm</emph> a gentleman at large; my
                  friend here, is a Union officer."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Colonel! how are you?" exclaimed the official, looking up and touching his
                  cap to my companion. The Colonel returned his salutation, and in a moment the
                  other was at the bottom of my trunk, taking an inventory of the spare waistcoats,
                  extra socks, and under-garments which it contained. In five minutes the ceremonies
                  were over, and we left the "receipt of customs" devoutly thankful that we were not
                  of the wandering tribes of Israel. The whole scene was decidedly suggestive of a
                  landing among the French or Austrian officials; and it was with difficulty I
                  realized that I was in an inland American town, and merely passing from one State
                  of the Union to another.</p>
               <p>As I was seated, after supper, in the porch of the hotel, enjoying a fragrant
                  Havana, and the cool evening breeze, a lean, elongated "native" approached me. He
                  had a thin, haggard face; a tawny red skin; and a mass of coarse black hair, which
                  fell round his neck, like hemp round a mop-handle. His butternut clothes were much
                  the worse for wear, and torn in many places; and the legs of his pantaloons, which
                  made no effort to reach the coarse brogans that encased his feet, disclosed a skin
                  so scratched and furrowed that it seemed to have been gone over with a harrow. I
                  had seen thousands of his class, but there was a look of such intense wildness in
                  his gray eyes, which moved in their sockets with the unsteady glare of a wild
                  beast's, that I involuntarily started and turned toward him. Seeing my movement,
                  he said, in a quiet, civil tone:</p>
               <p>"How dy'ge, stranger? Dy'ge b'long yere?"</p>
               <p>"No, Sir."</p>
               <p>"B'long ter the army?" (I wore a suit of regimental blue, minus shoulder-straps
                  and brass buttons.)</p>
               <p>"No, Sir, I'm a peace man."</p>
               <p>"Peace man!—Copperhead?" and his eyes glared a little more wildly than before.</p>
               <p>"No, Sir, not exactly that, but I let others do the fighting."</p>
               <p>"Ye does! Wall, Sir, you uns is a cuss ter the kentry. Ye orter be druv out uv
                  hit. The man thet woant fight <emph>now</emph> haint fit ter live."</p>
               <p>"You're right, my friend. Sit down;" and I motioned him to a vacant chair beside
                  me. He continued standing, evidently not inclined to approach nearer to a man of
                  peace principles. Observing this, I added:</p>
               <p>"You misunderstand me—I'm a peace man, but I fight in my way—with a pen."</p>
               <p>"Oh! thet's hit? Wall, thet'll do, ef ye gwo hit powerful strong."</p>
               <p>"And how do you fight?"</p>
               <p>"Ary how? The rebs 'll tell ye thet."</p>
               <p>"But you don't wear the clothes; how is that?"</p>
               <p>"Why, me an' twelve right smart uns hes been beatin' the bushes—keepin' the
                  deestrict clar; but they's grow'd ter much fur us."</p>
               <p>"Oh! bushwacking."</p>
               <p>"Yas, but I hed ter put out. I'se gwine inter the army now—but I muss sell my mars
                  fust. Dy'ge know whot Government 'll pay fur a right smart chunk uv a mar?"</p>
               <p>"A hundred and five dollars, I believe, is the regular price."</p>
               <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6527-00000011"/>
               <p>"Taint 'nuff fur mine. They's powerful good brutes. I must git more'n thet, case
                  my 'ooman 'll hev nothin' else, an' she's sickly like."</p>
               <p>"But if you go into the army you can save a part of your pay for her."</p>
               <p>"No, I karn't. I'll be shot—I feel hit—I'se made up my mind ter hit." As he said
                  this, he seated himself in the chair I had offered him, and stared at me with a
                  still wilder, crazier look. I saw that some terrible calamity had unsettled his
                  intellect, and I said, in a sympathizing tone:</p>
               <p>"You're not well: you're not fit to go into the army now."</p>
               <p>"Yas, I is, Sir. I kin fight as hard as ary man <emph>ye</emph> knows. I'se a
                  little gin out jest now, 'case I'se rid nigh onter a hundred an' fifty mile, an'
                  hed ter tote my 'ooman a powerful piece o' the way."</p>
               <p>"Where have you come from?"</p>
               <p>"Clay county, nigh on ter Manchester. I lived thar. I'se plumb from thar this
                  evenin'."</p>
               <p>"And were you driven away?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir; druv away—robbed—hous'n burned—every thing burned, an' my ole
                  mother—killed—killed! killed!" He bent down his head while he spoke, and as he
                  repeated the last words they seemed to well nigh strangle him.</p>
               <p>"It can't be possible!" I exclaimed; "human beings don't do <emph>such</emph>
                  things!"</p>
               <p>"But they haint human bein's—they's fien's—devils from hell—from hell, Sir."</p>
               <p>"I know their passions are roused, but I did not know they murdered
                     <emph>women.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"They does, Sir. I'll tell ye 'bout hit;" and grasping one arm of my chair, and
                  leaning forward with his unsteady, blazing eye looking into mine, he told me the
                  following story:</p>
               <p>"'Bout a mile from whar I b'long thar lived a ole man by the name of Begley—Squire
                  Begley we called him, though he didn't own no slaves. He wus nigh on ter seventy,
                  but wus a right peart ole man, an' Union ter the core—two on his boys—Sam an'
                  John, is in the army now—8th loyal Kaintuck. Wall, 'bout a fortnit gone, on the
                  mornin' uv the fifteenth uv April, three men, dressed in Union cloes, comes ter
                  the ole gentleman's house, an' telled him they wus round raisin' a company ter put
                  down the rebs thet wus poreing inter the country. The ole man wus mighty pleased,
                  an' I reckon he wus unprudent in his talk; fur when they'd drawed him out, they
                  telled him they wus raally Secesh soldiers. Then he ordered 'em ter leave, but
                  they trottled him, an' dragged him off ter the edge uv a branch, 'bout half a mile
                  away, an' thar hung him ter the limb uv a tree. A ole nig thet war passin' 'long
                  the road heerd the ole Squire's cries, as he begged 'em ter hev marcy on his gray
                  hars; an' knowin' I war ter home, he put fur my house, and telled me on it. I axed
                  him ter tote my mars ter the bush, fur I know'd thar wus more on 'em round, an'
                  feared they'd be arter the nags, and then I put off ter save the ole man. I war
                  too late. He war dead, an' the infernal devils hed got nigh back ter his house,
                  meanin' to steal his fillies an' what plunder he hed thet could be toted. I
                  follered' em an so soon as I come in distance, I drapped one on 'em. Then me an'
                  tothers tuk ahind trees, an' blazed away ter one another fur more'n a hour. I
                  winged one, but I got a ball yere," showing an ugly wound in his shoulder. "Arter
                  a while six more on 'em rid up the road an' come at me. I seed it warnt<pb
                     n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6527-00000012"/> no use, so I put fur the thick timber,
                  an' finarly, seein' they couldn't kotch me, they guv up the chase. I know'd
                  twouldn't do ter gwo home, so I made a long spell round, ahind a hill, an' put for
                  the bushes whar I thort the ole darky'd be with the mars. It hed got ter be nigh
                  onter dark, an' I'd grow'd powerful weak, on 'count uv the blood I'd let, so I sot
                  down an' tried ter stop it. I hedn't sot long 'fore I thort I heerd a 'ooman
                  schreechin', an' lookin' round I seed my own wife. She'd jest lost har baby, an'
                  hedn't been out uv bed fur nigh a month, but she'd come six mile through the brush
                  arter me. She couldn't speak, but she brung me a short piece from ahind the hill,
                  an' show'd me my hous'n an' barn—all I hed in the world—a heap uv black an' ashes!
                  They'd burn'd 'em, Sir, an' druv my sick wife, an' my ole mother, who'd been
                  bedrid for more'n two year, out uv doors!"</p>
               <p>He paused for a moment, and then in a slow, broken voice, added: "Thet night she
                  died. Died—thar—in the dark, an' the cold—nothin' under har but the yerth—nothin'
                  over har but the ole gown thet my 'ooman helt up to keep the rain off har face;
                  an' when I kneeled down thar on the ground ter yere har last words, I swore, Sir,
                  I'd never rest till I'd drunk thar blood—the heart's blood uv every rebel in
                  Kaintuck!</p>
               <p>"The next day the darky buried har. I couldn't be thar. They wus huntin' me like a
                  wild beast. For more'n a week me an' my sick wife lay out in the woods; but we're
                  yere now, an' all I ax is ter sell my mars, an' git my 'ooman ter a safe place,
                  an' then I'll guv 'em—whot they's guv'n me!"</p>
               <p>From various sources I afterward received confirmation of the native's story; but
                  it needed none; for in the fierce passion which blazed in his eyes, and lit up his
                  haggard face, there was nothing but TRUTH.</p>

               <head type="sub">ON THE ROAD.</head>
               <p>THE next morning I started for Nashville. At the railway dépôt I was again
                  reminded that I might be entering the French or Austrian dominions. At every turn
                  my military passport was called for. I offered to pay my fare, and, "Please show
                  your pass, Sir," greeted me from the small opening in the ticket office. I tried
                  to force my way through the crowd which blocked the inner gateway of the
                  station-house, and, "Please show your pass, Sir," arrested my footsteps. I applied
                  for a check to my trunk, and, "Please show your pass, Sir," sounded from the lungs
                  of the luggage department. I attempted to get upon the train, and, "Please show
                  your pass, Sir," was echoed by a slim gentleman in shoulder-straps at the foot of
                  the platform; and, finally, when congratulating myself that at least one-fourth of
                  my perilous passage was accomplished, "Please show your pass, Sir," was smilingly
                  repeated by a young man in military cap and citizen's nether garments, who had
                  halted abreast of me in the aisle of the car. I drew it forth in despair.</p>
               <p>"Will this never end?" I exclaimed, in evident ill-nature.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, Sir. We'll not trouble you again—till we reach Nashville. It is annoying,
                  Sir; but absolutely necessary."</p>
               <p>The car, when we entered, was already packed with a general<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000013"/> assortment of Kentucky jeans, butternut linseys,
                  regimental blues, regulation buttons, and shoulder straps; but a single,
                  timid-looking woman in the corner, and a small sprinkling of civilians among the
                  soldiery, told plainly that none of our fellow-travellers were leaving home on a
                  pleasure excursion.</p>
               <p>Near the forward door were a number of citizens, who, politely displacing some
                  pieces of luggage, invited the Colonel and myself to squeeze ourselves into seats
                  by the side of two fat men in secession gray, who turned out to be planters from
                  Western Tennessee. They were of a party of neighbors, who had been to Louisville
                  together, and were then returning to their homes.</p>
               <p>As the train moved off from the station, one of them said to me:</p>
               <p>"You're from the North, Sir?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir."</p>
               <p>"Things are rather disturbed with ye jest now—aren't they? That Vallandigham
                  affair is creating some trouble?"</p>
               <p>"Not much, Sir—the best ale will foam; it is only a little froth on the
                  surface."</p>
               <p>"It seems to me it's more than froth," said my right-hand neighbor. "I reckon your
                  people are about tired of the war. If the Democrats were in power, they'd stop
                  it."</p>
               <p>"How would they stop it?"</p>
               <p>"By letting the South go. I'm a Union man, Sir, but I've had enough of the war—I
                  want peace. You people at the North know nothing about it. We're robbed by both
                  sides; we can't stir out of our houses in safety; I never wake in the morning but
                  I fear the day will be my last."</p>
               <p>"It is a sad state of things, no doubt; but I fear it will continue till the South
                  submits."</p>
               <p>"Then it will last forever," exclaimed another planter, who sat facing me. "The
                  South will never submit, Sir! It will never come back! Every Southern man will die
                  first."</p>
               <p>"Allow me to ask if you're not a slaveholder?" said the Colonel, leaning forward,
                  and smilingly addressing the last speaker.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir; I own some twenty negroes."</p>
               <p>"I thought so. I never heard a man with less than that number express such
                  sentiments."</p>
               <p>"But I own more, and I'm not of that opinion," said the quiet gentleman beside the
                  Colonel. "I would be glad to see the South back."</p>
               <p>"You're not a native, Sir."</p>
               <p>"No, Sir; but I've done business here for thirty years. My friend, the Doctor
                  here," pointing to another gentleman, sitting opposite to me, "<emph>is</emph> a
                  native, and a slaveholder, and as rabid on the Union as I am."</p>
               <p>"And how many slaves have you, Doctor," asked the Colonel, with another of his
                  pleasant smiles.</p>
               <p>"Only two quarters of one, Sir, an old man and a woman, who were playmates of my
                  mother," answered the medical man.</p>
               <p>"I thought so," said the Colonel, quietly.</p>
               <p>"Come gentlemen," I exclaimed, laughing, "as the Colonel thinks the number of
                  darkies a man owns a sort of political barometer, suppose we take a census at
                  once."</p>
               <p>My suggestion was received good-naturedly, and in five minutes I had the
                  statistics. The corpulent planter, who expected each day would be his last, had
                  seventy odd; the Northern born merchant had twenty-seven; the doctor, two, and the
                  others, respectively, one hundred and nine, sixty-two, twenty-four, and
                  twenty-one; the latter number representing the interest<pb n="26-27"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000014"/> est the belligerent planter had in the peculiar
                  institution. A half-hour's desultory conversation followed, and during it each
                  one, except my right-hand neighbor, and the "No submission" man, expressed a
                  willingness to sacrifice his chattels to save the Union.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Colonel," I exclaimed, as I learned the sentiments of the last of the party,
                  "you are floored—your theory won't stand fire."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Perhaps</emph> it won't," he replied, dryly.</p>
               <p>More extended observation subsequently convinced me that his views are fully
                  supported by general facts.</p>
               <p>As the planter of secession proclivities was rather warmly combating my views on
                  the Emancipation Proclamation, a singularly self-possessed, gentlemanly-looking
                  man, of about fifty, approached us, and leaning against the arm of the opposite
                  seat, accosted me as follows:</p>
               <p>"And when the South is subdued, and the war is over, what will you do with four
                  millions of emancipated blacks?"</p>
               <p>"Set them at work, and pay them."</p>
               <p>"And would you, a white man, consent to live where every second citizen is a
                  black, and your political and social equal?"</p>
               <p>"Freedom of itself, Sir, will not make the black my equal. At the North he is not
                  politically or socially on a par with the white, and there he has had fifty years
                  of freedom."</p>
               <p>"But your black is inferior to ours. The negro is of a tropical race; he comes to
                  perfection only under a warm sun."</p>
               <p>"If that be true, your negroes are fit for freedom, for our blacks are as orderly,
                  industrious, and quietly disposed as any class we have."</p>
               <p>The new-comer was about to reply, when the Doctor, turning to him, said: "Colonel,
                  you consider our whites superior to our blacks; do you not?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly I do."</p>
               <p>"Then give the blacks freedom; subject them to free competition with the poor
                  whites, and you'll soon be rid of them, for they'll <emph>die out.</emph> The
                  Indian is naturally superior to the negro, but two centuries of contact with the
                  white man—the Indian being <emph>free</emph>—has reduced the race from sixteen
                  millions to two millions. Set the black free, leave him to himself, and his fate
                  will be the same."</p>
               <p>"Then slavery keeps the race alive among us?"</p>
               <p>"Of course it does; for, while the black labors for us, we feed, and clothe, and
                     <emph>think</emph> for him; and, besides—and this is the principal reason—we
                  are constantly infusing fresh white blood into his veins. That would not be if he
                  were free, for the black does not seek the white, but the white the black."</p>
               <p>"You have stated the strongest argument for Slavery that I ever heard. You say it
                  will save the black, and yet, while you admit that freedom would destroy him, you
                  would set him free!"</p>
               <p>"I would—to save the whites. The social and political corruption which absolute
                  control of him has bred among us, is destroying us. It has produced the present
                  state of things, and God is using this war—the fruit of our corruption—to purify
                  us. He has written on the wall—any man can read it—"Slavery is doomed!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> cannot read it, and I do not believe a good and just God ever
                  decrees the destruction of his creatures."</p>
               <p>"Has he not destroyed other races? He works by general laws, and one of the
                  plainest of His laws is, that the weak shall give way to the strong, the inferior
                  race to the superior. There<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6527-00000015"/> is no
                  hardship in this. Every man submits cheerfully to it—the old give up their places
                  to the young—the father dies, and the son succeeds him, and nobody grumbles. We
                  have obstructed the operation of this law on the black race, and now, in tears and
                  blood, we are paying the penalty."</p>
               <p>"You bookish men can spin fine theories, but we have to deal with facts, and hard
                  facts at that."</p>
               <p>"I have formed my theory on facts, Colonel, hard and black facts, too," replied
                  the Doctor, laughing.</p>
               <p>"But you never loved the slaves—never had them love you, as mine love me. When
                  Grant's army was at Memphis I told them they would be free if they went to it, and
                  not one of them left me."</p>
               <p>"That only proves, what everybody knows, that you are a kind master; and that your
                  negroes would work cheerfully for you, if they were free."</p>
               <p>"Well, there's no use talking to you; you're an incorrigible Abolitionist; but
                  come, Squire," addressing my right hand neighbor, "exchange seats with me. I want
                  to talk with this Northern gentleman, and I can't stand this any longer." The cars
                  were jolting considerably, and his position was not an easy one. The fat planter
                  rose, and the other seated himself beside me. As he did so, I said to him:</p>
               <p>"I never discuss slavery, Sir; it's a waste of words."</p>
               <p>"I don't wish to discuss it, Sir; I want to ask you the real state of public
                  feeling at the North. Where do you live, Sir?"</p>
               <p>This was spoken in a tone which showed he was accustomed to a good deal more
                  deference than is yielded to the ordinary run of planters. I quietly gave my name
                  and residence, and asked him for his.</p>
               <p>"George W. H——, of H—— Springs, near Clarksville, Tennessee."</p>
               <p>"Your name is familiar to me, Sir; I formerly knew General H——, of South
                  Carolina—he whose son commands the H—— Legion."</p>
               <p>"He was a near kinsman of mine. We're all of the old Virginia family."</p>
               <p>He then went on to ask me a multitude of questions about the condition of things
                  at the North. I answered frankly, and he listened attentively, but made no comment
                  when I expressed the opinion that the mass of our people would never consent to
                  the re-establishment of slavery.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>We were entering a beautiful region, where the thick grass was waving in the
                  meadows, the early flowers were blooming by the road sides, and the spring birds
                  were singing in the great old trees; but where the rich, red soil lay, unturned by
                  the plough, the stalks of the Autumn corn stood rotting on the ground, and ruin
                  and desolation stared at us from every thing. Broken fences, wasted fields,
                  deserted plantations, dismantled dwellings, and now and then, a burned woods, or a
                  charred chimney, standing a lonely sentinel over a weedy garden, or amid a
                  blackened grove, told that the whirlwind of war had passed that way, and left only
                  ravage and devastation in its path. A ragged woman, looking out from a wretched
                  hovel; a solitary man, lingering around a heap of ashes and crumbling bricks that
                  might once have been his home, or a group of half-clad negro children, gambolling
                  on the porch, or lolling lazily on the lawn of some deserted homestead, that still
                  looked down in faded grandeur on the ruin around it, were the only indications
                     of<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6527-00000016"/> human existence, and the only
                  remnants of a once peaceful and happy population. It was one of the most lovely
                  regions of the earth, naked, but beautiful even in its nakedness. I called the
                  attention of my new acquaintance to its appearance, and he remarked: "No portion
                  of this wide country has so fine a climate, or so rich and fertile a soil. Before
                  we reached Elizabeth-town, we passed through what is called the 'bed of the
                  Ohio'—a white clay region, heavily timbered, but deficient in iron and lime, and
                  devoted mainly to grazing. Now, we are ascending an elevated plateau of
                     <emph>red</emph> clay, rich in every thing except ammonia, and producing,
                  almost spontaneously, enormous crops of wheat, rye, corn, hemp, blue grass, and
                  tobacco. At Bowling Green this plateau is broken by irregular ridges that spring
                  out from the Cumberland Mountains, and sink into the lower lands bordering the
                  Mississippi. They give a more beautiful diversity to the surface, but the
                  character of the soil continues the same, as, indeed, it does over nearly the
                  whole of this State (Kentucky) and Tennessee. Anywhere in this region the subsoil,
                  turned up by the plough, and exposed for a short time to the action of the air,
                  becomes a manure almost as valuable as guano. These two States, Sir, were meant by
                  nature to be the garden of this continent. Adam when he first woke in Eden, did
                  not look on a more beautiful landscape, or a more luxuriant vegetation, than is
                  everywhere spread around you; but now—what has war done! A curse has fallen on
                  these once happy homes—the 'abomination of desolation' sits in these pleasant
                  places."</p>
               <p>"But the day will soon come, Sir, when free labor, free schools, and free men will
                  people this region, and make it in reality, the paradise which GOD designed it
                  should be."</p>
               <p>"We cannot foresee the end, Sir, but my heart sickens when I think of what it may
                  be—these old homesteads dismantled, these rich plantations cut into little plats
                  of a half dozen acres, and divided among the negroes, or squatted on by a vulgar
                  herd of Irish and Germans. I hope I may not live to see it, Sir; but let even
                     <emph>that</emph> come rather than disunion and the perpetual war that would
                  follow."</p>
               <p>"And are you a Union man, Sir!" I exclaimed in pleased surprise. "I feared from
                  what you said of slavery, that you were not."</p>
               <p>"Union, sir! my Unionism has been tried; it has stood the test—every test but
                  death; and I am ready to meet that for it. I believe in slavery; I think it the
                  normal condition of the black race; I know my negroes are happier than they would
                  be in freedom; and—I love them, sir. But I love my children better. I do not want
                  to leave them a heritage of endless war; and therefore, I am willing to abolish
                  slavery, if the Union cannot be saved without it."</p>
               <p>"You must have suffered greatly, sir, living as you do, in a section where the
                  secession element is so strong."</p>
               <p>"I have. My plantation has been sacked, my life has been threatened—every relative
                  I have in the world has turned against me. A committee waited on me, just before
                  the June (1861) election, and told me that fifty ropes were ready to hang me if I
                  did not cease my Union talk, and vote the separation ticket. With two of my
                  negroes, armed to the teeth, I went to the polls, and defied them. I voted 'No
                  Separation.' Then they dragged me and Judge Catron before the Military Commission
                  at Nashville. They questioned us, and ordered us to leave the State. The Judge
                  consented, but I charged them with sending<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6527-00000017"
                  /> us away because they had changed, while we had not, and I told them to their
                  faces that I would not go—that I would die first. One of my near kinsman was on
                  the Commission, and I accused him of being recreant to every principle of our
                  ancestors. He only answered, 'I'll not argue that question with you. We may be
                  wrong, but we're embarked in this thing; our lives are at stake, and
                  self-preservation, which makes a man sacrifice his dearest friend to save himself,
                  impels us to go on. We cannot turn back.' It is that feeling which holds the
                  leaders together. After that, my wife entreated me, and I am ashamed to say it, I
                  was less outspoken. But I was a <emph>marked</emph> man; they annoyed me and
                  plundered me in every way. At one time they quartered a whole regiment upon me. I
                  went out and told them: 'You are my neighbors; I love you, and would not kill you,
                  but I curse you. I curse you for the ruin you are bringing on your country.' God
                  heard me, Sir, and that curse rested on them. Out of the fifteen hundred that went
                  to Richmond, only two hundred were left when Grant took Memphis! The rest had
                  answered the muster-roll in eternity! Then every man felt justified in taking my
                  life. I walked every day arm-in-arm with death. I was waylaid, shot at, my well
                  was poisoned. How I escaped, the Providence that guarded me only knows. When the
                  soldiers left, society became reduced to a state of anarchy—a struggle for
                  self-preservation. Brothers turned against brothers, parents against children,
                  children against parents. No man was safe. Even my friend Shackelford, law partner
                  of Gustavus A. Henry, member of the Confederate Senate, was threatened with death.
                  At the outset he had gone with the current, and his only son had volunteered; but
                  when he saw the ruin which Secession was bringing on his section, he applied to
                  Henry for the young man's release. An order was at once issued for his own arrest,
                  and he only escaped by fleeing the State. No words can picture to you, Sir, the
                  state of things that existed. All that Dante and Milton have told us of hell falls
                  short of what we experienced."</p>
               <p>"And through all this you stood true to the Union! I honor you, Sir; from the
                  bottom of my soul, I honor you."</p>
               <p>"You need not, for I knew their plans. I knew that all their talk about the
                  extension and perpetuation of slavery is mere sham, to cover their real designs,
                  which are to <emph>subvert republican institutions, and found a bastard monarchy
                     on the ruins of their country!</emph> I loved slavery, Sir. I love it still;
                  but even to save it I could not aid in overthrowing the institutions founded by my
                  fathers. I could not lift my puny arm in opposition to the manifest designs of
                  God, which are that all men shall be <emph>free</emph> and
                  <emph>equal.</emph>"</p>
               <p>I did not ask him why the blacks had been overlooked in the designs of DEITY; I
                  merely remarked: "And are you satisfied that such are the intentions of the rebel
                  leaders? I know that Spratt, and other Southern theorists, advocate monarchy as
                  the only government compatible with slavery; but I have not supposed your
                  practical statesmen had adopted such views."</p>
               <p>"They have. Those ideas are the main-spring of the Rebellion. But for them it
                  would never have been undertaken. I <emph>know</emph> it. The whole scheme was
                  opened to me. If it had not been I should have gone with the current. I could not
                  otherwise have stemmed it. The English and French governments know it, and that is
                  the reason the rebels have so much sympathy from them. They have kept the design
                  carefully out of sight; only the ringleaders have been in the secret, for they<pb
                     n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6527-00000018"/> knew that if the masses discovered it
                  before they had them bound hand and foot by military despotism, the whole jig was
                  up."</p>
               <p>He paused, for just then the engine-whistle sounded shrilly through the trees, the
                  train broke up, every man in the car sprang to his feet, and a dozen voices cried
                  out:</p>
               <p>"The guerillas are on us!"</p>
               <p>"Are you armed, Sir?" said my new acquaintance to me, as coolly as if we were at
                  his dinner-table.</p>
               <p>"No, Sir, I am not."</p>
               <p>"Take this; it may be useful."</p>
               <p>Cocking the revolver, and giving one thought to those I had left at home, I seated
                  myself, and breathlessly awaited the expected assault.</p>

               <head type="sub">GUERILLAS.</head>
               <p>AS the train came to a halt, the Doctor, who had been enjoying a quiet nap, opened
                  his eyes, and asked:</p>
               <p>"What's to pay?"</p>
               <p>"Reckon the Bushwhackers are on us!"</p>
               <p>"That can't be, this side of Bowling Green—some one had better reconnoitre," and
                  rising from his seat, he drew from his pocket a pistol about as large as a boy's
                  pop-gun, and strode toward the doorway."</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, Doctor, don't go there! Keep inside!" exclaimed half a dozen
                  voices.</p>
               <p>Not heeding the warnings, the medical gentleman stepped upon the platform, saying,
                  "Where's the guard? Well, these fellows are never where they should be."</p>
               <p>The single soldier who had been stationed before the door, had suddenly
                  disappeared. Naturally objecting to standing as a target for fifty rebel rifles,
                  he had retreated into the forward car. The Doctor, then glancing cautiously
                  around, and apparently seeing nothing to satisfy his curiosity, made a sudden
                  spring for a huge tree which grew a short distance from the track. He alighted
                  within a few feet of it, and by the movement secured two breastworks; the tree in
                  his front and the car in his rear.</p>
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6527-00000019"/>
               <p>"He jumps like a wild cat," exclaimed the Colonel, "but look at our neighbors
                  here! Ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>Turning about, I beheld nearly all of the citizens crouched on the floor, beneath
                  the windows, and not a few of the officers with arms (and legs) <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">couchant.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>"I say, Squire," said the Colonel, laughing, "'The wicked flee when no man
                  pursueth.' The devils would have been on us before now if they were coming."</p>
               <p>"The wise man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself—the fool holdeth up his head
                  and getteth hit," responded the Squire, with a ludicrous effort at merriment.</p>
               <p>"That isn't in my version. But, Doctor, what's the detention?" to the latter, who
                  that moment re-entered.</p>
               <p>"Two or three rails displaced—that's all. Some scoundrel meant to throw us off the
                  track."</p>
               <p>I breathed more freely; for, if the truth must be told, my respiratory apparatus
                  had not performed its usual functions during the preceding occurrences. My whole
                  being had been absorbed in two senses—sight and hearing. With my eyes ranging
                  intently around, and my ears strained to catch the lightest outside sound, I had
                  made those organs do the work of at least five days in those five minutes. Even a
                  brave man—and bravery is not essential to one of my profession—is shaken when
                  confronting an unseen danger; and how the Colonel and the Doctor maintained such
                  perfect coolness I could not imagine. I said as much to them, when, at the end of
                  a half-hour, we resumed our seats, and the train got again under way.</p>
               <p>"Courage," replied the Colonel, "like almost every thing else, is a thing of
                  habit. A man who has for two years daily expected every bush would give him a
                  bullet, gets indifferent to danger; but, after all, I had rather have death come
                  at me face to face, than spring on me suddenly from behind a rail fence."</p>
               <p>"It is barbarous—this guerilla system," I remarked, again dovetailing my legs
                  within the Doctor's.</p>
               <p>"It's more than that—it's hellish," he replied; "Jeff. Davis should be hung for
                  inaugurating it."</p>
               <p>"If you imagine," said the Colonel, "all the thieves and cutthroats of New York
                  let loose upon the city, with unlimited license to kill, burn, and destroy, you
                  will have a faint idea of what it is. The lowest dregs of society, our gamblers,
                  horse-thieves, and criminals, make up these bands. Now and then a respectable man,
                  too cowardly to go into the regular army, joins them; but he soon becomes as bad
                  as the rest. They submit to no restraint, but range the country, plundering and
                  murdering friend and foe. If a worthless fellow has a grudge against a neighbor,
                  he joins them, denounces his enemy as a Union man, and stealing on him at night,
                  either shoots him down before his wife and children, or burns his house over his
                  head. They spare neither sex nor age. Lone women are outraged, old men are
                  murdered by them. I paid them eleven thousand five hundred dollars for my own life
                  only last fall. Wherever they go terror reigns; and more than one-half of this
                  State and Tennessee is under their control. In fact, their raids extend even
                  within the Union lines. Mounted on swift horses, they make a sudden dash on a
                  picket-station, or a railway train, and are ten miles away before pursuit can be
                  commenced."</p>
               <p>"And the King Devil among them is a Yankee," said the Doctor, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Is that true?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—but don't be offended. I know you export your<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000020"/> meanest specimens; and that our people have some
                  traits worse than yours. The North loves gold—the South loves power; and the love
                  of power is infinitely worse than the love of gold. One absorbs a man in self, but
                  makes him orderly, quiet, and law-abiding; the other renders him restless,
                  turbulent, and impatient of control—ready to overturn every thing, human and
                  divine, that stands in the way of his personal ambition. It led Satan to rebel in
                  Heaven, and it made our leaders rise against the best Government on earth; and,
                  Sir, we cannot end this war until we serve them as the Lord served the devil—send
                  them to h—l!"</p>
               <p>This was said with a warmth that, in one of the Doctor's cool temperament,
                  surprised me; but I merely remarked:</p>
               <p>"You would go too far. Strip them of their negroes—their power is in them—and they
                  will be harmless. Reduced to earning their bread by the sweat of their brows,
                  they'll find no time to plot revolutions."</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken. Our people are ignorant, and accustomed to being led by them.
                  Seeing them impoverished, they'll pity them, and be just as much under their
                  control as now. We must weed the whole race out of the South. I wouldn't hang
                  them—they are too many for that; but I'd expatriate every one of them. Until that
                  is done, there'll be no lasting peace."</p>
               <p>"Well, it strikes me we'll have to catch the birds before we cage them."</p>
               <p>"And going on as we are going now we'll never catch them," remarked the Colonel;
                  "I sometimes think God has struck our rulers with judicial blindness to punish the
                  nation for its sins. Why, Sir, I have half a dozen negro boys who could manage
                  things better than they are managed at Washington. Half-way measures—always acting
                  a little too late—scattering our forces over the whole continent, when we should
                  concentrate them against vital points, is ruining us; and if it goes on, will make
                  the South independent."</p>
               <p>"I can see where the Administration has blundered; but it is easier to see
                  mistakes than to suggest remedies. How would <emph>you</emph> suppress the
                  Rebellion?"</p>
               <p>"By calling out a million of men; and coming down on the South like an avalanche.
                  That would end the war in ninety days. Now, with six hundred thousand on the
                  outside of a circle, we are trying to whip four hundred thousand on the inside. It
                  can never be done. The rebels can so quickly re-enforce any threatened point, that
                  they will always be numerically superior where a battle is to be fought. It takes
                  nearly half our present force to keep up our communications. Rosecrans here—our
                  best General—has, perhaps, seventy-five thousand men, but thirty thousand are
                  required to protect his lines of two hundred and fifty miles, and he is kept idle
                  because he cannot bring into the field as many men as Bragg."</p>
               <p>"And do you think the rebels have four hundred thousand?"</p>
               <p>"Every man of them; and they can bring out another one hundred thousand, besides
                  two hundred thousand negroes."</p>
               <p>"And dare they arm the negroes?"</p>
               <p>"They do it now. The first company raised in Memphis was of blacks. When they are
                  driven to the wall, they'll put a musket into the hands of every negro within
                  their lines, and <emph>make</emph> him fight. My own opinion is that the slave is
                  to end this war. Each side will use him. He'll be put in the front ranks, and the
                  result will be the present generation will be<pb n="40-41"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000021"/> exterminated. Thus, though not in the Doctor's way,
                  may be brought about the fate he predicts for the blacks."</p>
               <p>"God speed the day!" exclaimed the Doctor. "You see I'm an Abolitionist, Sir, but
                  not one of the Yankee stripe."</p>
               <p>"I perceive you're not a negro worshipper; but, Colonel, after the North has
                  crushed out this immense force, how can it bring the Southern people into a
                  cordial reunion with it?"</p>
               <p>"They'll come into it of themselves. Nine-tenths of the rank and file of the rebel
                  army would gladly lay down their arms, and go peacefully back to their homes
                  to-day. They have been misled and forced into this thing; their hearts are not,
                  and never have been, in it. Only the leaders are irreconcilably in earnest. The
                  Rebellion is merely a shell. We have but to crack it, to find it hollow. The
                  Southern people have had false ideas of the Yankees—the war has made them know
                  them better and like them better. Our masses had seen none but the sneaking,
                  cowardly, money-loving kind. One of my own brothers-in-law is of that sort. He got
                  a hundred and fifty negroes by my sister, and the first thing he did was to whip
                  one of them to death—an old house-servant, who had carried his wife in his arms
                  when she was a child. He is now a rabid Secessionist, as are all of his
                  class."</p>
               <p>"And who is this King Devil of the guerillas, as the Doctor calls him?"</p>
               <p>"His name is Woodward. He was a schoolmaster at Hopkinsville, Thurston County,
                  Kentucky. He knew all the thieves and rascals in the district, and at the breaking
                  out of the war raised a regiment of fifteen hundred among them and offered it to
                  Mr. Davis. Davis refused it, because the men were not enlisted for three years.
                  Then Woodward divided his force into squads of from twenty to two hundred, and
                  overran the State. There are five or six thousand of these devils now, in this
                  State and Tennessee, and some of their atrocities are past belief."</p>
               <p>"I have heard something of them," I replied. "Parson Brownlow introduced me, at
                  Cincinnati, to a number of East Tennessee refugees, who had suffered every thing
                  but death at the hands of these men. One of them, a farmer by the name of Palmer,
                  from near Pikeville, in Bledsoe County, was attacked by a party in his own house
                  in the daytime. He killed two of them, but was shot in four places, and left for
                  dead. His wife, who attempted to shield him, was also wounded; but after
                  incredible hardship got her husband to Lexington, and from there to Cincinnati,
                  where the Parson secured him a place as conductor on the street cars. When I came
                  through he was about to volunteer under Burnside, being determined to have
                  vengeance for what he had suffered. Another one was Knights, a noted scout, who
                  has served under Rosecrans, and is now with Burnside. His adventures would make a
                  history as interesting and strange as any romance. He has crossed the mountains as
                  guide to Union men, escaping to join our army, seventy-two times! and, though
                  repeatedly shot, has been taken but once. Then he escaped in a most wonderful
                  way.</p>
               <p>"How was it?" asked the Doctor.</p>
               <p>"He was captured by a small party while crossing Walden's Ridge. They at first
                  decided to hang him on the spot, but finally, to obtain the reward offered for his
                  capture, concluded to deliver him to the Confederate authorities at Knoxville. He
                  was at once tried and sentenced to be hung. While he was in<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000022"/> jail awaiting execution, his daughter was admitted
                  to see him. He pretended to be unable to sit up, in consequence of a wound
                  received when he was taken, and of course the daughter had to bend down to hear
                  what he said. In these circumstances he managed, though a sentinel stood directly
                  over him, to whisper: 'Under your skirt—a coil!—to-morrow!' She procured a 'coil,'
                  as he termed it, hid it under her clothes, and the next day went again to the
                  jail. The sentinel refused to admit her, but the officer, softened by her
                  entreaties to see her father for the last time—he was to be hung the next
                  day—finally granted her an interview of five minutes. The soldier stood by all the
                  while, as before, but while frantically embracing her father, she managed to
                  convey the priceless rope under the bed-clothes. The night happened to be dark and
                  stormy, the sentinels kept under shelter, and before morning, Knights, with three
                  others, let himself down from the third story and escaped. He is past sixty, but
                  as hale and vigorous as any young man you ever knew."</p>
               <p>"I'll never speak against women's hoops again," exclaimed the Doctor, "for once
                  they've done the country service."</p>
               <p>"The East Tennesseeans have suffered terribly," said the Colonel, "but the
                  barbarities practised on them have been committed all over this section. Wherever
                  the guerillas have gone, they have left a trail of burning houses, and butchered
                  men and women. Some of them are such monsters of crime that one is tempted to
                  believe the Devil has become incarnate in long hair, slouched hat, and butternut
                  trowsers. Over here in Clinton County, one named Champ Ferguson was recently
                  killed, who, I suppose, had committed more murders than any man in the Union.
                  Before the war he was a gambler, thief, and counterfeiter, and naturally joined
                  the Rebellion. He organized a small band, and for more than a year committed
                  unheard of atrocities unchecked. Reuben B. Wood, an aged citizen of Clinton
                  County, had greatly befriended him. Ferguson rode up to Wood's house one day in
                  September, 1861, called him out, and coolly told him he was going to kill him.
                  'Oh, no! Champ, you'll not do that! I never done you any harm!' exclaimed the old
                  man.</p>
               <p>"'But you toted the d—d Lincoln flag at Camp Dick Robinson.'</p>
               <p>"'Why, Champ,' said Wood, 'I almost raised you. I held you on my knee when you was
                  a child.'</p>
               <p>"'You're a d—d Lincolnite,' said the monster, and shot him dead.</p>
               <p>"On another occasion he had a Union man by the name of Spangler lashed to a tree,
                  and beaten to death. In April, 1862, he and his band came upon a party of
                  neighbors collected at a log raising in Fentress County. He shot a number of them
                  as they were attempting to escape, and took the rest prisoners. Then he bade his
                  men hold each prisoner by the arms, and deliberately ripped open their bowels with
                  a knife! A man by the name of Fragge had incurred his enmity. He was confined to
                  his bed, dangerously sick, his little child lying beside him, and his wife sitting
                  near. Ferguson entered the room and told him he had come to kill him. Fragge
                  pleaded for life; his wife entreated the ruffian to spare her husband, but he
                  raised his pistol and gave him a severe wound. Fragge again entreated for life,
                  but Ferguson again raised his pistol, and while the sick man clasped his
                  frightened child to his breast, shot him dead! The wife supposing both husband
                     and<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6527-00000023"/> child killed, ran frantically from
                  the house. Then Ferguson stole the dead man's clothes, and the blanket that
                  covered his bed!"</p>
               <p>"Tell me no more! You have said enough to convince me that all the passions of
                  hell are 'let loose in this war.'"</p>
               <p>"They are. Men have become fiends. They thirst for blood. They gloat over their
                  victims. The last drop of human feeling has gone out of them. Death and ruin
                  follow them everywhere. They have made this lovely country a HELL!"</p>
               <p>We soon afterward arrived at Memphis Junction, and bidding me a kindly "good-by,"
                  and urging me to visit them if my time allowed, the Colonel and his companions
                  left the car and took the train which was in waiting for Clarksville.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE UNION SCOUT.</head>
               <p>THE States of Kentucky and Tennessee have been made one vast battle-ground by this
                  war. Every county and every township has been the scene of some fierce struggle,
                  or the theatre of some bloody drama, whose memory will live for generations.
                  Grass-grown cross-roads, where rude guide-posts point ways no traveller ever went;
                  sleepy hamlets, unknown to the census-taker and the tax-gatherer, where the
                  spelling-book and the mail-bag never were seen; lonely log meeting-houses, where
                  some ignorant pastor doled out to a scanty crowd of more ignorant "white trash"
                  weekly potions of "wholesome admonition," and—the country newspaper; have become
                  world-famous. Distant lands have heard of them; distant times will speak of them,
                  and romance and poetry will couple their names with heroic deeds, and make them
                  holy places in our nation's history.</p>
               <p>At every station on the Nashville road the traveller sees indications of the
                  fierceness of this struggle, and evidences of a valor worthy of the most heroic
                  ages. At Mumfordsville, on a little mound overlooking the Green River, is a low
                  earthwork encircled by a shallow ditch, and enclosing less than an acre of ground.
                  There Colonel Wilder and a small band of raw Indianians arrested the northward
                  march of Bragg's army for forty hours!</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6527-00000024"/>
               <p>"It is the whole of Bragg's force! It is madness to resist! We must surrender!"
                  exclaimed one of Wilder's lieutenants.</p>
               <p>"I know we must surrender. But we'll do it <emph>when they make us,</emph>"
                  replied the brave commander.</p>
               <p>Five thousand rebel muskets belched fire upon them during six hours, but crouching
                  behind those mud walls that handful of brave men sent back a storm of hail that
                  mowed down the advancing ranks as the scythe mows down the summer grass.</p>
               <p>"Surrender at once, or we'll give no quarter," was borne to them by the flag of
                  truce.</p>
               <p>"We ask none," was the sole reply, and the work of death went on.</p>
               <p>Twelve thousand men, in ranks six deep, their bayonets gleaming in the sun, then
                  enveloped that little hill, and again and again, within eighty feet of that frail
                  breastwork, poured in their deadly volleys, but at each discharge clear and loud
                  rang out the words: "Aim low, boys. Let every shot tell!" and broken and decimated
                  the assailants fell back to their quarters.</p>
               <p>At sunrise of the third day another flag approached. "You are brave men. We would
                  spare your lives. We have posted cannon at every angle. We can level your
                  intrenchments in half an hour!"</p>
               <p>"I do not believe it; convince me of it, and I'll surrender."</p>
               <p>They led him out. He saw the guns, and surrendered.</p>
               <p>"If he had held out another half hour I should not be here to tell you of it,"
                  said the modest young corporal who told me the story.</p>
               <p>Into a stagnant pool at the left of the fort three hundred and fifty mangled
                  rebels were thrown at nightfall. Seven hundred dred now lie buried in the woods
                  hard by. How great a graveyard for so small a town!</p>
               <p>But I cannot particularize all that I saw, where at every bridge was a stockade,
                  and on every hill a battle-field.</p>
               <p>Here and there broken cars and charred rolling-gear strewn along the track showed
                  that the guerillas had been recently at work. At Bowling Green, in the bed of the
                  Big Barren—a little stream which flows near the town—were the fragments of a train
                  that, with its freight of mules, had been burned on the bridge only three weeks
                  before, and at the station next south of Gallatin, was a similar wreck; but,
                  closing my eyes on these relics of an almost savage warfare, and these
                  uncomfortable reminders of personal danger, I perched my legs on the seat just
                  vacated by the Abolition philosopher, and soon fell asleep.</p>
               <p>I was dreaming of home, and of certain flaxen-haired juveniles who are accustomed
                  to call me "Mister Papa," when a heavy hand was laid on my shoulder, and a gruff
                  voice said:</p>
               <p>"Doan't want ter 'sturb yer, stranger, but thar haint nary nother sittin'-place in
                  the whole kear."</p>
               <p>I drew in my extremities, and he seated himself before me. He was a spare,
                  muscular man of about forty, a little above the medium height, with thick sandy
                  hair and beard, and a full, clear, gray eye. There was nothing about him to
                  attract particular attention except his clothing, but that was so out of all
                  keeping with the place and the occasion, that I opened my eyes to their fullest
                  extent, and scanned him from head to foot. He wore the gray uniform of a Secession
                  officer, and in the breast of his coat, right over his heart, was a round hole,
                  scorched at the edges, and darkly stained with blood! Over his shoulder<pb
                     n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6527-00000025"/> was slung a large army revolver, and at
                  his side, in a leathern sheath, hung a weapon that seemed a sort of cross between
                  a bowie-knife and a butcher's cleaver. On his head, surmounted by a black plume,
                  was a moose-colored, slouched hat, and falling from beneath it, and tied under his
                  chin, was a white cotton handkerchief stiffly saturated with blood! Nine
                  motley-clad natives, all heavily armed, had entered with him and taken the vacant
                  seats around me, and at first view I was inclined to believe that in my sleep the
                  train had gone over to the enemy and left me in the hands of the Philistines. I
                  was, however, quickly reassured, for, looking about I discovered the Union Guard
                  and my fellow-travellers all in their previous places, and as unconcerned as if no
                  unusual thing had happened. Still, it seemed singular that no officer had the new
                  comer in charge; and more singular that any one in the uniform he wore should be
                  allowed to carry arms so freely about him. After a while, having gleaned all the
                  knowledge of him that my eyes could obtain, I said in a pleasant tone:</p>
               <p>"Well, my friend, you appear to take things rather coolly."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, Sir! I orter. I've been mighty hard put, but I reckon I'm good fur a
                  nother pull now."</p>
               <p>"Where are you from?"</p>
               <p>"Fentress County, nigh onter Jimtown (Jamestown). I'm scoutin' it fur
                  Burnside—runnin' boys inter camp; but these fellers wanted ter jine Cunnel
                  Brownlow—the old parson's son—down ter Triune. We put plumb fur Nashville, but hed
                  ter turn norard, case the brush down thar ar thick with rebs. They'd like ter a
                  hed us."</p>
               <p>"Oh, then you wear that uniform as a disguise on scouting expeditions?"</p>
               <p>"No, Sir; I never hed sech a rig on afore. I allers shows the true flag, an' thar
                  haint no risk, case, ye see, the whole deestrict down thar ar Union folks, an' ary
                  one on 'em would house'n <emph>me</emph> ef all Buckner's army wus at my heels.
                  But this time they run me powerful close, an' I hed ter show the secesh rags."</p>
               <p>As he said this he looked down on his clean, unworn suit of coarse gray, with
                  ineffable contempt.</p>
               <p>"And how could you manage to live with such a hole there?" I asked, pointing to
                  the bullet rent in his coat.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I warn't inside uv 'em jest then, though I warrant me he war a likely feller
                  thet war. I ortent ter a done hit—but I hed ter. This war he;" and taking from his
                  side pocket a small miniature, he handed it to me.</p>
               <p>It was a plain circlet of gold, attached to a piece of blue ribbon. One side of
                  the rim was slightly clipped, as if it had been grazed by the passing ball, and
                  the upper portion of the ivory was darkly stained with blood; but enough of it was
                  unobscured to show me the features of a young man, with dark, flowing hair, and a
                  full, frank, manly face. With a feeling akin to horror I was handing the picture
                  back to the scout, when in low, stammering tones he said to me:—</p>
               <p>"'Tother side, Sir! Luk at 'tother side."</p>
               <p>I turned it over, and saw the portrait of a young woman, scarcely more than
                  seventeen. She had a clear, transparent skin, regular, oval features, full,
                  swimming, black eyes, and, what must have been dark, wavy brown hair, but changed
                  then to a deep auburn by the red stains that tinged the upper part of the picture.
                  With intense loathing, I turned almost fiercely on the scout, and exclaimed: "And
                  you killed that man?"</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6527-00000026"/>
               <p>"Yes, Sir, God forguv me—I done hit. But I couldn't holp hit. He hed me down—he'd
                  cut me thar," turning up his sleeve, and displaying a deep wound on his arm; "an'
                  thar!" removing the bandage, and showing a long gash back of his ear. "His arm wus
                  riz ter strike agin—in another minhit he'd hev cluv my brain. I seed hit, Sir, an'
                  I fired! God forguv me—I fired! I wouldn't a done hit ef I'd a knowd thet," and he
                  looked down on the face of the sweet young girl, and the moisture came into his
                  eyes: "I'd hev shot 'im somewhar but yere—somewhar but <emph>yere!</emph>" and
                  laying his hand over the rent in his coat, he groaned as if he felt the wound.
                  With that blood-stained miniature in my hand, and listening to the broken words of
                  that ignorant scout, I realized the horrible barbarity of war.</p>
               <p>After a pause of some minutes he resumed the conversation.</p>
               <p>"They killed one on our boys, Sir?"</p>
               <p>"Did they! How was it?"</p>
               <p>"Wal Sir, ye see they b'long round the Big Fork in Scott County; and bein's I war
                  down thar, an' they know'd I war a runnin' recruits over the mountins ter
                  Burnside, they telled me they wanted me ter holp 'em git 'long with they oung
                  Cunnel. They'd ruther a notion ter him—an' he <emph>ar</emph> a feller thet haint
                  growd everywhar—'sides all the folks down thar swar by the old Parson."</p>
               <p>"Well, they ought to, for he's a trump," I remarked good-humoredly, to set the
                  native more at his ease.</p>
               <p>"Ye kin bet high on thet; he haint nothin' else," he replied, leaning forward and
                  regarding me with a pleased, kindly expression. "Every un down my way used ter
                  take his paper; thet an' the Bible war all they ever seed, an' they reckoned one
                  war 'bout so good as 'tother. Wall, the boys thort I could git 'em through—an'
                  bein's it made no odds to me <emph>whar</emph> they jined, so long as they
                     <emph>did</emph> jine, I 'greed ter du hit. We put out ten days,
                  yisterday—twelve on 'em, an' me—an' struck plumb fur Nashville. We lay close
                  daytimes, 'case, though every hous'n ar Union, the kentry is swarmin' with
                  Buckner's men, an' we know'd they'd let slide on us jest so soon as they could
                  draw a bead. We got 'long right smart till we fotched the Roaring River, nigh
                  onter Livingston. We'd 'quired, an' hedn't heerd uv ary rebs bein' round; so,
                  foolhardy like, thet evenin' we tuk ter the road 'fore hit war clar dark. We
                  hedn't gone more'n a mile till we come slap onter 'bout eighty Secesh calvary. We
                  skedaddled fur the timber, powerful sudden; but they war over the fence an' on us,
                  'fore we got well under cover. 'Bout thirty on 'em slid thar nags, an' come at us
                  in the brush. I seed twarn't no use runnin; so I yelled out: 'Stand yer ground,
                  boys, an' sell yer lives jest so high as ye kin!' Wall, we went at hit ter close
                  quarters—hand ter hand, an' fut ter fut—an' ye'd better b'lieve thar war some tall
                  fightin' thar fur 'bout ten minhits. Our boys fit like fien's—thet little chunk uv
                  a feller thar," pointing to a slim, pale-faced youth, not more than seventeen,
                  "laid out three on 'em. I'd done up two myself, when the Capt'n come onter me—but,
                  I've telled ye 'bout him;" and drawing a long breath, he put the miniature back in
                  his pocket. After a short pause he continued:—</p>
               <p>"When they seed the Capt'n war done for, they fell back a piece—them as war left
                  on 'em—ter the edge uv the timber, an' hollered fur 'tothers ter come on. Thet guv
                  us time ter load up—we'd fit arter the fust fire wuth knives—an' we blazed inter
                  'em. Jest as we done hit, I heer'd some more calvary comin'<pb n="52-53"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000027"/> up the road, an' I war jest tellin' the boys we'd
                  hev ter make tracks, when the new fellers sprung the fence, an' come plumb at the
                  Secesh on a dead run. Thar warn't only thirty on 'em, yit the rebs didn't so much
                  as make a stand, but skedaddled as ef Old Rosey himself had been arter 'em."</p>
               <p>"And who were the new comers?"</p>
               <p>"Some on Tinker Beaty's men. They'd heerd the firin' nigh two mile off, an' come
                  up suspicionin' how things wus."</p>
               <p>"But, are there Union bands there? I thought East Tennessee was overrun with rebel
                  troops."</p>
               <p>"Wall, hit ar; but thar's a small chance uv Union goorillas in Fentress and
                  Overton county. They hide in the mountins, an' light down on the rebs, now an'
                  then, like death on a sick parson. Thar is places in them deestricts thet a
                  hundred men kin hold agin ten thousand. They know 'em all, case they wus raised
                  thar, an' they know every bridle-path through the woods, so its well nigh
                  unpossible ter kotch 'em. I reckon thar's a hundred on 'em, all mounted, an'
                  bein's as they hain't no tents, nor wagins, nor camp fixin's they git round mighty
                  spry. Thar scouts is allers on the move, an' wharever thar's a showin', they
                  pounce down on the rebs, cuttin' 'em ter pieces. Thet's the how they git powder
                  an' provisions. They never trouble peaceable folk, an' haint no sort o' 'spense
                  ter Guverment; but they does a heap uv damage ter the Secesh."</p>
               <p>"Well, they did you a 'powerful' good turn."</p>
               <p>"They did thet; but we lost one on our boys. He war only sixteen—brother ter thet
                  feller thar," pointing to a young man sitting opposite. "They hung his father, an'
                  now—they's killed him," and he drew a deep sigh.</p>
               <p>"Why did they hang his father?"</p>
               <p>"Wall, ye see, they kunscripted him—he war over age, but they don't mind thet—an'
                  he desarted, meanin' ter git ter the Union lines. They kotched him in the woods,
                  an' hung him right up ter a tree."</p>
               <p>"Was only one of your men hurt?"</p>
               <p>Yes, two on 'em wus wounded too bad ter come wuth us. The calvary toted 'em off
                  ter the mountins, an' I reckon they'll jine 'em when they gits round. But we left
                  elevin uv the rebs dead on the ground."</p>
               <p>"Did your men kill so many? The cavalry had a hand in that, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, they killed two—thet's all. They couldn't git at 'em, they run so. We done
                  the rest."</p>
               <p>"You must have fought like tigers. How many were wounded?"</p>
               <p>"Nary one; what wan't dead the boys finished."</p>
               <p>"You don't mean to say that your men killed the wounded <emph>after the
                     fight?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I reckon they did—some four on 'em."</p>
               <p>"My friend, that's nothing but murder. I had hoped the rebels did all of that
                  work."</p>
               <p>"Wall, they does—anuff on hit; an' I never could bring my mind ter think it war
                  right or human: but I s'pose thet's case I never hed a father hung, or a sister
                  ravig'd, or a old mother shot down in har bed. Them things, you knows, makes a
                  difference."</p>
               <p>"And have any of your men suffered in such ways?"</p>
               <p>"In sech ways? Thar haint one on 'em but kin tell you things 'ud turn yer blood
                  ter ice. D'ye see thet feller thar?" pointing to a thin, sallow faced man, two
                  seats in our rear.<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6527-00000028"/> "Not two months gone,
                  some twenty rebs come ter his house while he war layin' out in the woods, an'
                  toted his wife—as young an' purty a 'oman as yer own sister—off 'bout a mile, an'
                  thar tuk thar will uv her—all on 'em! She made out ter crawl home, but it killed
                  har. He warn't wuth har when she died, an' hit wus well he warn't, fur he'd hev
                  gone clean crazy ef he hed been. He's mor'n half thet now—crazy fur blood! An' kin
                  ye blame him? Kin ye 'spect a man thet's hed sech things done ter him ter show

                  like hit; an' they go in ter kill or be kilt. They doan't ax no marcy, an' they
                  doan't show none. Nigh twenty thousand on 'em is in Burnside's an' old Rosey's
                  army, an' ye kin ax <emph>them</emph> if they doan't fight like devils. The iron
                  has entered thar souls, Sir. They feel they's doin' God sarvice—an' they is—when
                  they does fur a secesh. An' when this war ar over—ef it ever ar over—thar'll be
                  sech a reckonin' wuth the rebs uv East Tennessee as creation never know'd on
                  afore. Thar won't be one on 'em left this side uv hell!" This was said with a
                  vehemence that startled me. His eyes actually blazed, and every line on his seamed
                  face quivered with passion. To change the subject, I asked:</p>
               <p>"And what did you do after the fight?"</p>
               <p>"Not knowin' what moight happen, we swapped cloes with sech uv the rebs as hed
                  gray 'uns, an' put North—plumb fur the mountins. Nigh onter Meigsville we come
                  onter a Union man, who holped us ter cut some timber, an' make a raft—fur we
                  'lowed the Secesh would track us wuth houns, an' ter throw 'em off the scent we
                  hed ter take ter the water. We got inter Obey's Fork, an' floated down ter the
                  Cumberland; hidin' in the bushes in the day time, an' floatin' at night. We got
                  nigh onter Carthage, an' knowin' the river wan't safe no longer, we left hit an'
                  struck 'cross fur the railroad. Thet kentry ar full uv rebs, but hevin' the Secesh
                  cloes on, we made out ter git 'nuff ter eat till we got yere."</p>
               <p>We had crossed the Cumberland, and were then approaching Nashville. Its beautiful
                  suburbs, though covered with the early foliage of spring, wore a most desolate
                  appearance. Magnificent villas were heaps of ruins; splendid plantations and
                  charming gardens were overrun with weeds. How fearfully have their owners expiated
                  the mad crime of Secession! How have they sown the wind and reaped the
                  whirlwind!</p>
               <p>At the station-house we ran the gauntlet of another set of military officials.
                  Passes were examined and luggage was looked into, but after a while the Colonel
                  and I squeezed out of the crowd, and into an omnibus. "I go to the 'Commercial,'"
                  he said to me. "I've tried the 'St. Cloud,' and I'm disposed to see if the other
                  is quite so bad."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll go with you. I'm familiar with Southern hotels, and don't expect
                  much."</p>
               <p>If I <emph>had</emph> expected much, I should have been disappointed; for truth
                  compels me to say—and I've been somewhat of a traveller and seen strange
                  lodging-places in my time—that the "Commercial Hotel" of Nashville is the
                  filthiest, buggiest house, public or private, I ever passed a night in. In any
                  Northern town it would be indicted as a nuisance, calculated to breed pestilence
                  and bad morals among the people. Biscuit, heavy as lead; steak, tough as leather;
                  coffee, thick as mud; and corn-cake so saturated with smoke that all its original
                  flavor had departed, was its unvarying bill of fare. No, not unvarying, for a
                  small fee to the ebony waiter did procure me some<pb n="56-57"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000029"/> strawberries, and for them I blessed him, and of
                  them I made my supper.</p>
               <p>Being fatigued with my journey, I asked, early in the evening, to be shown to a
                  room, and a servant conducted me to a dingy apartment in the rear of the house,
                  where I had full advantage of all the fumes and perfumes of the kitchen. Its
                  dimensions were about eight feet by twelve, and its walls were smeared with soot
                  and tobacco juice. The bare floor, which had never known a mop or a
                  scrubbing-brush, was coated with a layer of soil thick enough to raise a crop of
                  potatoes—but the bed, and the curtains, and the linen! (though, to be exactly
                  truthful—it wasn't linen)—these I must leave to the reader's imagination, for no
                  description would do them justice. Suffice it to say that after an hour's
                  persistent effort, I did effect some improvement in them; and then, "wrapping the
                  drapery of my couch" about me, I lay down, but not to "pleasant dreams;" for at
                  that moment the darkies in the barber's shop below stairs struck up "de banjo an'
                  de bones," and for two mortal hours I was forced to listen to all the Ethiopian
                  songs, written and unwritten, in existence. In sheer desperation I finally rose,
                  took a seat by the window, and to the intense delight of the sable melodists,
                  joined in the refrains. To give the reader an idea of what I had to endure, and of
                  what "public sentiment" among the darkies of Nashville may be supposed to be, I
                  subjoin one of the songs, which I tried to take down in the dark: <q>

               <p>It was nearly eleven o'clock when the good-natured darkey who led the minstrels,
                  put his head out of the window, and said<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6527-00000030"/>
                  to me: "Now, massa, we'll 'clude de ex'cises ob de evenin' by singin' Ole John
                  Brown, wid de variations; and you'm 'spec'fully 'vited to jine de chorus."</p>
               <p>I did "jine de chorus," and therefore the reader is deprived of the "variations,"
                  which I might otherwise have committed to paper. However, if he is curious about
                  them I can gratify him with others quite as good, for while I was in Tennessee I
                  assisted at the martyrdom of "Ole John Brown" at least twenty times, and each time
                  it was done with "variations."</p>
               <p>Nothing, perhaps, so forcibly illustrates the progress of emancipation sentiment
                  in the army, and among the people of Tennessee, as the wonderful popularity of
                  that song. It is sung by every one, high and low, and everywhere its spirit is
                  felt. Truly John Brown s "soul is a marching on!"</p>

               <head type="sub">THE NASHVILLE PRISON.</head>
               <p>THE next day was Sunday. I rose early, and going down to the office found my
                  friend the Colonel already stirring. "Ah," he said, as I bade him "good-morning,"
                  "I'm in luck. An orderly has come in with my horse, and an ambulance goes out
                  under an escort this morning. In half an hour I shall be off."</p>
               <p>[Triune was distant only eighteen miles, but the road was infested with guerillas,
                  and was unsafe for single travellers.]</p>
               <p>"I am glad for that, on your account, but sorry on my own. I had reckoned on your
                  aid in procuring access to my friends at the prison."</p>
               <p>"You'll have no difficulty about that. Call on Colonel Martin at the Capitol; tell
                  him who you are, and he'll give you a permit."</p>
               <p>After breakfast, with mutual expressions of good-will we parted. I have formed
                  many agreeable acquaintances while travelling, but never one more agreeable than
                  the sturdy Indiana Colonel. He had a frank, glowing, genial nature that attracted
                  me irresistibly to him, just as one is attracted to a warm wood fire on a winter
                  evening. Indeed he is somehow associated in my mind with a generous wood fire—one
                  of the glorious, old-fashioned kind; of oaken logs, piled high on a broad hearth,
                  and giving out oxygen enough to supply a small village.</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6527-00000031"/>
               <p>When he was gone, the landlord said to me, "If you don't know none of the military
                  folk, Sir, you stand a sorry chance of gittin' inter the prison. Ye see, they
                  karn't admit them as they don't know. 'Twouldn't do, nohow."</p>
               <p>If that was true, I was in a dilemma. I had provided against such a contingency by
                  taking with me, on leaving home, half a dozen introductory letters to Governor
                  Johnson, but that gentleman was not in Nashville, and might not arrive for a week,
                  therefore they were of no present value.</p>
               <p>As I sat down to ponder over "the situation," I suddenly remembered having heard
                  that the son of an old friend was an officer in a Tennessee regiment. "Landlord,"
                  I said, addressing the publican—(he told me he was also a Re-publican, but other
                  trustworthy persons assured me that he was a rabid rebel. This I thought accounted
                  for the filthy condition of his establishment). "Landlord," I said, "can you tell
                  me where the —— Tennessee is stationed?"</p>
               <p>"Here, Sir; 'bout two miles out—nigh to Fort Negley."</p>
               <p>This was agreeable news, and writing a few lines to the young Tennesseean, in
                  which I alluded to my long friendship with his father, and asked him "to come over
                  and help" me. I despatched a messenger at once to the camp. In about an hour the
                  negro returned, but with the unwelcome tidings that "de Cap'n am off, Sar; off
                  scoutin' it, Sar, and dey doan't know <emph>when</emph> he'll be back, but dey
                  reckon he'll come yere, d'recly he come, Sar; d'recly he come, Sar."</p>
               <p>The morning was passing away while I was thus casting about for an escort, and at
                  last I determined to do what I should have done at first—set out alone.</p>
               <p>As I climbed the steep hill which leads to the Capitol, I was struck with the
                  gloomy aspect of the silent, sombre houses, and the noiseless, deserted streets.
                  It was a bright, summer-like day, and near the hour for morning service; but, with
                  the exception of a solitary soldier, or a smartly-dressed darkey, sauntering idly
                  along, no one was abroad. The white population had mostly fled, and the few that
                  remained welcomed the "Northern intruders" with bolted doors and barred windows. I
                  realized I was walking the streets of a conquered city. Arrived at the Capitol—an
                  imposing pile of white marble, more spacious and beautiful than any similar
                  edifice in the Northern States—I found myself under the walls of a huge fortress,
                  frowning with cannon and encircled with breastworks. Its marble steps were flanked
                  by stockades, and its broad battlements crowned with artillery, which, from its
                  elevated position, commanded the entire town and surrounding suburbs. In the
                  distance, the Casino and Forts Negley and Confiscation looked down from rocky
                  elevations, and beyond them a broad belt of military camps engirdled the captive
                  city. To my unpractised eye the defences seemed, as they no doubt are,
                  impregnable, and with what emotions must they be contemplated by Nashville's
                  tobacco lords, who skulking back from exile in Dixie, stand now and then on those
                  neighboring hills, and look down on the homes their own mad treason has shut them
                  out from forever.</p>
               <p>Approaching the sentinel at the principal stairway, I said: "Will you tell me
                  where to find Colonel Martin?"</p>
               <p>"An shoore an' I 'will, Sir. Foller the grand hall till ye come forninst the
                  Guv'ner's room—ye'll spy it over the dhoor, thin, say nothin' to nobody, but go
                  straight in, Sir, an' ax fur the Cunnel, an' ye'll have him."</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6527-00000032"/>
               <p>"Thank you. And pray, what brought you here—all the way from auld Ireland."</p>
               <p>"Fath, yer honor, an' I come to fight—to fight for the naygur;" and he shrugged
                  his shoulders, as if what he said might not be strictly true.</p>
               <p>"You don't mean that."</p>
               <p>"Troth, an' I does. I niver loiked the black divils—though them as is here hain't
                  black, fur they's <emph>yaller</emph>—till I come out to fight fur 'em; but I've
                  sort o' takin' to 'em since. An Irishman, ye knows, if he's niver a hapenny in his
                  pocket, has allers a feller feelin' fur a poor divil as is poorer thin he is—an'
                  sorry a bit of any thing in the world has the naygur. He don't own his own
                  children, Sir; not avin the flesh on his bones."</p>
               <p>"Your kindred, where I live, are not of your way of thinking."</p>
               <p>"An' where may that be, yer honor?"</p>
               <p>"In New York."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yis, I know; they's all Dimocrats there, an' Fernandy Wud Dimocrats at
                  that—bad luck to him. If you'd loike to kinvart 'em, Sir, jest send 'em out here.
                  I warrant ye they won't be four an' twenty 'oours in the State till they's Black
                  Republicans—as black as the naygurs themselves. An Irishman's a heart in him, Sir,
                  an', be gorry, he can't see the poor craytures wid his own eyes widout havin' a
                  feller feelin' fur 'em."</p>
               <p>"Well, good-by, and good luck to you."</p>
               <p>"Good-by, an' good luck to yerself, yer honor;" and he called out as I passed up
                  the stairway, "Go straight on, yer honor, an' say nothin' to nobody; but ax fur
                  the Cunnel, an' ye'll find him, right forninst the Guv'ner's room, ye mind, its
                  over the dhoor."</p>
               <p>I found the "Governor's room," in blazing gilt, "over the dhoor," and entered the
                  opposite apartment. I had less difficulty than I had anticipated in procuring
                  access to the prison. The potent "open sesame" were certain names I carried in my
                  pocket, and in less than half an hour I was on my way elate with the expectation
                  of shortly seeing "my Southern friends."</p>
               <p>The Nashville Penitentiary was burned at the taking of the city by the Union
                  forces. The building now used as a State Prison is located about a mile outside of
                  the city limits, and is of brick, surrounded by a high wall covering an area of
                  perhaps two acres. It was built, as I learned from a marble slab imbedded in the
                  wall over the doorway, in 1828, and looks substantial enough to last for a dozen
                  centuries. As I approached its broad entrance-way, I saw at my right, in a
                  spacious yard surrounded by a low stone fence, a hundred or more motley-uniformed
                  Confederates, engaged in the favorite out-door occupations of their class, such as
                  "seven-up," "quoits," "pitch and toss," and "chuck-a-luck." A sad-visaged man,
                  dressed in seedy black, was pacing to and fro among them, now and then pausing to
                  gaze abstractedly at the players, and again walking on, his eyes fixed on the
                  distance, as if searching for some sign of "the good time" which every mortal
                  thinks is "coming." To him, poor man, it is a long way off, for he will not go
                  out, he says, until the South is independent. He was the political editor of
                     <title>The Baptist Standard,</title> and refusing to take the oath of
                  allegiance, has been confined there seven long months. A few more decently clad
                  persons were in the assemblage, but much the larger portion were the most wretched
                  specimens of "white trash" I had ever seen. In all sorts of habiliments—coatless,
                  hatless, shoeless, with matted hair and dirt-incrusted<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000033"/> faces, they seemed recently exhumed from some
                  pig-sty or barn-yard. Love of "our native soil," with them, was evidently a living
                  sentiment.</p>
               <p>Passing on, I asked the guard at the doorway to call the keeper. That gentleman
                  soon appeared, and I made known to him my business.</p>
               <p>"No persons of those names are here, or have been here, Sir!"</p>
               <p>And such is the vanity of human pursuits! I had travelled a thousand miles on a
                  fruitless errand! Vexed and disappointed, I was turning away, when the keeper
                  politely said:</p>
               <p>"You look tired; won't you walk in and sit down?"</p>
               <p>I followed him into the prison, and after I had rested a while he invited me to
                  look through it. It is in two divisions, one devoted to criminals, the other to
                  prisoners of war. None of the latter are confined in cells, but, during the day,
                  are allowed to range freely over the yard and the several floors of the building.
                  At night they are locked into roomy apartments, where often a dozen, and sometimes
                  twenty, camp down together on straw mattresses spread on the floor. The sleeping
                  accommodations are not much to boast of, but they are, no doubt, far superior to
                  what the prisoners are accustomed to in Dixie. As we were passing over the second
                  floor the keeper said to me:</p>
               <p>"In the further room is the Colonel of the first Tennessee cavalry—Colonel Brewer,
                  formerly a lawyer in this place. He was taken at Brentwood, some five weeks ago.
                  He is a very sociable, gentlemanly man, and would be glad to see you. Will you go
                  in?"</p>
               <p>"No, thank you, I'll not intrude upon him."</p>
               <p>"He'll consider it no intrusion. I'll ask him."</p>
               <p>He rapped at the door and a voice called out, "Come in."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Colonel, good-morning," said the keeper, stepping into the apartment. "I'm
                  showing this gentleman over the building. He's right from the North, and I knew
                  you'd like to see him."</p>
               <p>"Most certainly I should. Ask him in."</p>
               <p>As I entered, the prisoner measured me with a rapid glance; then, without rising,
                  held out his hand, saying cordially, "I'm glad to see you, Sir; pray be seated.
                  Mr. Keeper, be so good as to hand a chair."</p>
               <p>"No, excuse me, Sir," I replied; "I'll not stay; I'll not intrude on you in your
                  present circumstances."</p>
               <p>"My present circumstances are the very reason you should, Sir. I see no one,
                  except the sentinel, from one week to another. I've nothing to look at but these
                  blank walls, and the 'human face divine' has grown wonderfully attractive to me.
                  It's as pleasant as thoughts of home. So pray, sit down. I'll return the favor to
                  the first one of your 'countrymen' who falls into my hands."</p>
               <p>Thus entreated, I could not decline. As I took the proffered seat, I glanced
                  around the apartment. It was spacious and well lighted by mullioned window's.
                  Along its sides were ranged half a dozen camp beds; and as many chairs, and two
                  small tables straggled about the floor. Its walls were not over-cleanly, but the
                  floor was nicely sanded, and the whole had a tidy, comfortable appearance. It was
                  evidently reserved for the better class of political prisoners. Its occupant was a
                  man of about thirty-five, and of decidedly prepossessing appearance. He had a
                  fine, intellectual face, and long brown hair, as soft and glossy as a woman's; but
                  a full, dark eye, wide, strong jaws, and a firmly cut mouth, showed him possessed
                  of a manly,<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6527-00000034"/> determined character. I saw
                  at a glance that he was no common man. He was dressed in the Confederate uniform,
                  and as he lay on the outside of a cot, in a half-recumbent attitude, he every now
                  and then moved uneasily, as if in pain. Seeing this I said:</p>
               <p>"Are you wounded?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; your boys gave me a pill when they captured me. The ball entered here,"
                  opening his shirt, and showing a large scar just below his heart. "The flesh has
                  healed, but the ribs are not yet well knit together. It bothers me some to keep an
                  easy position. But, tell me, what is your name, and where do you live?"</p>
               <p>I told him.</p>
               <p>"And do you know a gentleman of your name—let me see, what is his first name? —, I
                  think,"</p>
               <p>"I can't say that I know him, though I ought to. I'm the man himself."</p>
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> are!" and raising himself on his elbow he shook me again warmly
                  by the hand. "I'm delighted to know you. I've heard Dick —— speak often of
                  you."</p>
               <p>"I know him well; we were intimate friends for twenty years."</p>
               <p>"So he's told me. We've been all through the war together. He's a prince of a
                  fellow. Davis has just made him a general. But he says you've turned
                  Abolitionist."</p>
               <p>"Not exactly that; but I go for putting you rebels down, and I think it can't be
                  done without taking away your slaves."</p>
               <p>"But you can't put us down," he replied, good-humoredly; "you'll have to crush our
                  military power before you reach the darkies, and <emph>you</emph> ought to know
                  you can't do that."</p>
               <p>"I don't know it. It's a mere question of time and numbers; three against one are
                  sure to conquer in the long run."</p>
               <p>"When the three have brains; but, you see, your three haven't."</p>
               <p>"I know your generals have thus far shown more ability than ours; but occasions
                  are sure to develop men, though it may take time. How long was it before the
                  English Revolution produced Cromwell, and the French, Napoleon?"</p>
               <p>"A long time, I know. But generals are not what you want. You have them now. You
                  have Rosecrans, and Banks, and Grant, and little Phil. Sherridan down there at
                  Murfreesboro. Either of them is a match for any leader we have, and Rosecrans is
                  head and shoulders above any general on this continent. <emph>He</emph> has a
                  great, organizing, military mind. He checkmated Lee so handsomely in Western
                  Virginia that Lee himself isn't ashamed to own it. If <emph>we</emph> had him we'd
                  whip you in ninety days; but you shut him up, without supplies or horses, where he
                  can do nothing, and where our cavalry can walk round him, as a clown walks round
                  the pole at a circus. It is not generals you want. You want brains. You want an
                  Administration."</p>
               <p>"But we think we have one," I answered, laughing; "slow, it may be, but sure; and
                  'as honest as the times allow.'"</p>
               <p>"Slow, it's true; but—honest! Talk of its being <emph>honest,</emph> with Stanton
                  in it! a man as corrupt as sin, as venal as a Tombs lawyer! and as ignorant as a
                  darkey. And you trust the management of a great war to him! But, it suits us
                  exactly. It convinces me the Almighty means we shall be free."</p>
               <p>"But never will be free. Your Government is a despotism already, and whatever may
                  be said of ours, our liberties are safe with it."</p>
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6527-00000035"/>
               <p>"Liberties! There's an awful amount of cant about that word. Our people are as
                  free as people should be. This idea of universal suffrage—making a small sovereign
                  of every ignorant clodhopper who comes into the country, is played out. We've
                  tried it under the old Government, and had enough of it. Republican institutions
                  are a failure, and you'll be convinced of it before many years."</p>
               <p>A two hours' conversation, ranging over these and kindred subjects, ensued between
                  the Colonel and myself, and in the course of it he stated, that it is the purpose
                  of the rebel leaders to found an elective monarchy, and that they had that design
                  at the inception of the Rebellion. "I own no slaves," he said, "and am therefore
                  not personally interested in sustaining the institution. I am fighting for
                  something that I can leave to those after me—a title that can be perpetuated in my
                  family; and I know, whether I live or die, I shall be successful; for, if I am
                  killed, my country will do me justice in my children."</p>
               <p>He spoke freely and openly of this. "I am willing," he said, "that all mankind
                  should know it. The time has gone by when it was policy to conceal it from our
                  poorer classes. We have them now where they <emph>must</emph> submit, and with the
                  rest of the world—England, France, Spain, and even Russia, which now so cottons to
                  the North—it will vastly help us."</p>
               <p>He expressed the opinion that a rupture is imminent between England and the United
                  States. "England, till now, has covertly played into our hands. She will soon
                  throw off the mask, and do overt acts that will make war inevitable, if the
                  Northern people have a spark of manhood or self-respect left."</p>
               <p>If Vicksburg had not fallen—if Lee had not been defeated—if the Copperhead leaders
                  had not been foiled in their attempt to force New York into the Rebellion, what
                  the rebel Colonel predicted might, ere this, have proved true.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE ARMY CHAPLAIN.</head>
               <p>WALKING slowly back through the open fields, I came, at the distance of a short
                  half mile from the prison, upon the white tents of a regiment of infantry. A few
                  sentinels were pacing to and fro among them, but they were otherwise deserted.
                  Near by, however, under the broad branches of a mammoth maple, the denizens of the
                  canvas city were gathered around a spare, gray-haired, thin-visaged man, dressed
                  in a stiff black stock, a check <foreign xml:lang="FRA">neglige</foreign> shirt,
                  and blue lower garments, who, in his shirt sleeves, was holding forth on the
                  beauties of Freedom. Attracted by his earnest manner, and his rich, mellow voice,
                  which rang out on the still air like the call of a bugle on the eve of battle, I
                  joined the half-a-thousand martial auditors, who, seated on camp-stools, leaning
                  on muskets, or lolling on the thick green grass which carpeted the ground, were
                  drinking in his words as if they were the notes of an opera singer.</p>
               <p>"I am tired and disgusted," he said, "with this endless talk about the everlasting
                  negro. I doubt not he is a man, with very much such blood, and bones, and brains,
                  and soul as we have. I doubt not his destiny is linked with ours—and that in the
                  coming life many, very many of his sooty race will hold the highest seats in the
                  synagogue, and look down on us as we now look down on them. But that is no reason
                  why we should worship him—no reason why we should settle him comfortably in his
                  master's easy chair, and let him idle away his life smoking bad tobacco and
                  drinking <unclear>mean</unclear> whiskey, while we are fighting for his freedom.
                  No, boys, give him freedom—every man, whatever his color, is entitled to that—but
                  make him fight for it. Make him do what we have to do—work out our own salvation
                  on hard tack and salt pork, with often not half enough of that. Tell him that John
                  Brown <emph>is</emph> a marching on, but 'marching on' over Tennessee roads, with
                  sore feet and weary legs, and the mud over his boots; and tell him, too, that the
                  black man, if he would be free, must follow where John Brown leads. If he will not
                  do this—give him Hail Columbia, and never let his ugly face be seen among you
                  again.</p>
               <p>"And those of you who worship the ebony idol, who in pity for the wrongs of the
                  black forget that our own race has greater wrongs and deeper woes than his, let me
                  tell you what is worthy of your worship—what all good and true men, in all times,
                  have worshipped—what they have fought, and suffered, and died for, with songs on
                  their lips and joy in their hearts—and then, if you persist in shutting your eyes
                  to every thing in heaven and earth but the black man, you are past all hope,
                  and—'may God have mercy on your souls.'</p>
               <p>"What I would have you worship is Freedom—<emph>white</emph> Freedom—FREEDOM FOR
                  ALL MEN. Poets have sung of it as a beautiful maiden, glowing as the dawn, radiant
                  as the stars, smiling as the sun when he first looked on the earth. They have said
                  that her throne is the glory of Heaven, her light the hope of the world; that her
                  home is the bosom of God, her resting-place the hearts of men; that she has
                  crowned the earth with beauty, and filled its dwellings with joy; that its
                  fragrant fields waft her incense, and its gorgeous cities speak<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000037"/> her praise; that on lowly cots and lofty mansions,
                  on teeming workshops and hallowed temples, her name is written—written in letters
                  that will outlast the marble, and grow in splendor forever. And this is true; but,
                  I have seen her stripped of her glory—a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth. I
                  have seen her fleeing from the haunts of men, and hiding away among the rocks and
                  caves of the wilderness. I have seen her back scarred with lashes, and her limbs
                  quivering with pain; her soul racked with anguish, and her body tortured with
                  fire; I have seen her weeping like Rachel for her children—weeping amid the ruins
                  of all she loved; and, worse than this, I have seen her fainting in her misery and
                  grovelling in her shame, and I have heard her deny the God who made her and the
                  heaven from which she came!</p>
               <p>"And all this I have seen <emph>here</emph>—in this land, every inch of whose soil
                  is wet with the blood our fathers shed to make it free!</p>
               <p>"And shall this longer be? Shall we shut our eyes and steel our hearts to the woes
                  of the white man, while we weep salt tears over the wrongs of the black? Shall we
                  let this accursed race of men-stealers and women-whippers go free when the slave
                  is liberated? Or, shall we say to them, take your foot from off the neck of the
                  poor white, release <emph>his soul</emph> from its bondage—a bondage more galling
                  than the fetters of the slave—give him the light of heaven and the knowledge of
                  earth, and let his children know there is a God and a life to come. Shall we not
                  say this? Shall we be men if we say less? What one of you will consent that this
                  war shall end till the white man, as well as the black, is Free?"</p>
               <p>And then the Chaplain descanted on the condition of the poor white man and on the
                  system and the men that have made him what he is; and for another half hour I
                  listened to as odd a medley of slang and poetry, highfaluten and quaint eloquence,
                  as ever fell from preacher's lips.</p>
               <p>When a hymn was sung and a benediction said, I turned slowly away and resumed my
                  walk towards the city. As I neared the camp I saw the Chaplain, still divested of
                  his coat, approaching me at a brisk pace. As he came opposite, I instinctively
                  touched my hat to him, and, returning the salutation, he said: "A pleasant
                  evening, Sir."</p>
               <p>"Very pleasant," I replied. "Let me thank you, Sir, for the very eloquent address
                  I have just listened to."</p>
               <p>"Let me thank <emph>you,</emph> Sir, for your flattering opinion of it. Not all,
                  however, who praise my sermons, subscribe to my doctrines."</p>
               <p>"I heard nothing to cavil at. You think the white trash more to be pitied than the
                  black slaves, and that the slave-owner must be shorn of his power to give the poor
                  man a chance to rise."</p>
               <p>"I do; and that is reason enough for freeing the negro. The slaveholders more than
                  the slave <emph>system,</emph> are the curse of this country; less than a hundred
                  thousand of them have ruled it for fifty years."</p>
               <p>"I know it. I gave that idea to the public more than a year ago."</p>
               <p>"Did you? In what?"</p>
               <p>I told him, and the announcement secured me a cordial grasp of his hand, a hearty
                  "God bless you," and an urgent request to join him at dinner. Being curious to see
                  more of so original a character, I accepted the invitation.</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6527-00000038"/>
               <p>The Chaplain's "lodge" was at the further end of the encampment, and looked down a
                  well-swept, gravelled avenue, which the soldiers had built between the two rows of
                  canvas houses. It was much more spacious than those about it. Its roof was formed
                  of two "shelter-tents," meeting together at the ridge, and its two gables were
                  constructed of triangular pieces of coarse cotton cloth. One end and its two sides
                  were covered with strips of weather-boarding, roughly nailed to short stakes, and
                  showing, by the vestiges of paint which still adhered to them, that they had
                  already done service on some of the dismantled dwellings in the vicinity. Two
                  camp-cots, several amputated chairs, a small, unpainted pine table, two or three
                  travelling trunks, and an old negro—to all appearance old enough to have been with
                  his forefather, Ham, in the Ark—who lay fast asleep in one corner, composed the
                  furniture of the interior.</p>
               <p>Tendering me one of the broken-backed chairs, the Preacher touched the negro
                  lightly with his foot, and said to him: Wake up, Julius. Wake up." As the ancient
                  African turned over and slowly opened his eyes, the Parson continued: "Come, old
                  fellow, order dinner—dinner for three, and then give us a taste of whiskey-punch.
                  D'ye hear?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, yas, Massa, I yeres. I'll git 'em quicker no time. W'at a powerful sermon
                  dat wus o'yourn, massa—powerful," replied the black, as, raising himself from the
                  ground, first on one knee, and then on the other, and steadying himself by one of
                  the camp-cots, he painfully clambered to his feet. When he had reached his highest
                  altitude he might have been four feet and ten inches from the enormous brogans
                  which formed his base of operations; but if nature had denied him height, she had,
                  true to her system of "compensation," given him breadth and thickness. He
                  certainly measured four feet around the hips, and across the chest—on his back was
                  a protuberance as large as a bushel basket—some unknown quantity I did not even
                  guess at. With his low stature, his hump-back, his white, frizzled locks, and his
                  short, bandy legs, which bowed in like a cow's horns, he might have been taken for
                  Richard III., risen from Bosworth field, and, in his old age, turned negro
                  preacher.</p>
               <p>"Yes, powerful," rejoined the parson, "but mighty little <emph>you</emph> heard of
                  it. You were fast asleep the whole time."</p>
               <p>"Well, Massa, but I yeard it. Dis pore ole body wus a sleepin' down dar, but de
                  sperrit soared 'way ter you—it did Massa; it yeard ebery word—ebery word."</p>
               <p>"What was the text?"</p>
               <p>"I does'nt zactly 'member, Massa Parson," rejoined the black, manipulating his
                  wool in the manner peculiar to his race; "I does'nt <emph>zactly</emph> 'member,
                  but I tinks it wus suffin' loike de Lord am good ter all dat lub Him.
                     <emph>Suffin</emph>' loike dat, Massa."</p>
               <p>"No, you old sinner, it wasn't any thing like it—It was: 'Without are dogs and
                  sorcerers, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.' And that's where you'll get,
                  old man, if you don't give up your everlasting lying. But come, stir your stumps.
                  Order dinner and get the whiskey."</p>
               <p>The old black rolled himself off. When he was out of hearing, I said to the
                  Parson: "You chose your body-servant for his beauty, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"No, I didn't. I chose him for his piety. There is more of the spirit of Christ in
                  that old darky than I ever knew in a human being. I'll bet m best sermon against a
                  glass of whiskey<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6527-00000039"/> that he'll be in heaven
                  a thousand years before any white man living."</p>
               <p>"That's great odds," I replied, laughing; "but he <emph>will</emph> lie."</p>
               <p>"That isn't his fault. It's one of the effects of Slavery. Slavery has forced him
                  to be a cringing sycophant all his life, and he can't throw off the habit all at
                  once. Habits are like mosses growing to a tree—they must be loosened gently,
                  gradually; if you strip them off violently, you kill the tree."</p>
               <p>"But somehow, I've always associated a comely form with a beautiful soul. How can
                  such goodness dwell in such a body as his?"</p>
               <p>"It is not the body that expresses the soul—it is the face. Look at his, and tell
                  me if you do not see heaven reflected in it. I have watched it for hours as he has
                  sat there on the ground, his body bent double, his eyes closed, and his chin
                  resting on his knees; and I have fancied that his spirit was really away among the
                  green fields and the pleasant streams that lie on the other side of Jordan. I have
                  no doubt it was."</p>
               <p>We were here interrupted by the entrance of a tall young man in a captain's
                  uniform, whom the Parson introduced to me as his messmate. "You see," said he, "in
                  union there is <emph>comfort</emph> as well as strength. The Captain and I have
                  put our tents together, and thus made quite a cosey nest here."</p>
               <p>"You have—a <emph>very</emph> cosey one. I think a little experience of this sort
                  of life would so enamor me of it that I should be reluctant to go back to gas and
                  conventionalism."</p>
               <p>"It would; I came out here at the prompting of duty—to be a martyr for truth and
                  the Union. But, bless your soul! I've found martyrdom so very pleasant that I'm
                  willing to suffer it every day I live. This sort is pleasanter, with salt pork and
                  cold weather, than the kind John Rogers took with a hot steak (stake) and a
                  roaring fire. Do you know I think man was meant for the savage state!"</p>
               <p>"You mean for the green fields, the open air, the breezy woods, and Freedom."</p>
               <p>"Yes, you've hit it; you speak like a poet and a philosopher to boot. But, come,
                  try some of this old saint's punch. Let me see—what do you call it, Julius?"</p>
               <p>This was addressed to the negro, who had just then entered, bearing a mammoth
                  tray, made of a piece of pine plank, hollowed in the centre, and curiously
                  ornamented at the edges with a variety of grotesque carvings, executed with a
                  jack-knife. On it was a steaming tankard of whiskey-punch, and four (the darky had
                  evidently thought of himself) tin goblets of decidedly plebeian appearance.</p>
               <p>Placing them on the small table which he drew up before us, the old negro
                  grinningly replied: "De 'lixer ob de gods, Massa."</p>
               <p>"The 'lixer' of the devil?" exclaimed the Captain, laughing: "Why, you old fool,
                  you don't suppose the gods drink whiskey-toddy, do you?"</p>
               <p>"Ob course dey does, massa Cap'n: doan't dey hab eberyting whot's good in heaben?
                  an' haint whiskey-toddy, sech as ole Jule make, jess 'bout de best ting you knows
                  on—now, haint it, massa Cap'n?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is, Jule. And now fill up, old boy—one for yourself—and let us drink to
                  the day when we shall all drink toddy together in heaven."</p>
               <p>We all rose and solemnly drained the cups. When they were replaced on the table,
                  the parson remarked:</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6527-00000040"/>
               <p>"There is nothing so unreasonable in Jule's theory as may at first appear. Not
                  that I suppose they drink whiskey-punch in heaven, but the connection between the
                  spirit and the body is so intimate that I can easily conceive of our earthly
                  appetites clinging to us after the soul has thrown off its grosser covering. In
                  that, and in the impossibility of gratifying their depraved longings, much of the
                  torment of bad men in the future life may consist."</p>
               <p>Amused at the oddity of the idea, I replied: "Undoubtedly it may, and I'll give
                  you a fact that supports the theory completely. It was given to me by a
                  distinguished gentleman—a Spiritualist. He says that an eminent lawyer—his
                  intimate friend, and an inveterate tobacco chewer—died and came to him about an
                  hour afterwards. They had a long conversation together, and in the course of it he
                  asked the lawyer what his strongest desire was when he first awoke to
                  consciousness in the other life. 'I wanted a chew of tobacco like the devil,' was
                  the lawyer's reply."</p>
               <p>At this the Captain broke into a boisterous fit of laughter, in which even the
                  sable saint joined. As soon as he could speak, the officer exclaimed: "He's into
                  you, Parson; you must look out—our friend is a bit of a wag."</p>
               <p>"But it'm de trufh, Massa Cap'n," earnestly chimed in the negro, who had seated
                  himself on the ground, and was busily nursing his calves and stroking his knees
                  with his chin. It'm de trufh—haint I <emph>seed</emph> dem dark, bad sperrets,
                  hangin' round doggeries, an' dem low places whar de Secesh hab dar shindies, jess
                  ter git a <emph>smell</emph>—on'y a little <emph>smell</emph> ob dat ar mis'able
                  stuff dey call Knock-em-stiff. An' dat haint no sech stuff as dis, Massa Cap'n;
                  taint no sech stuff as dis, I shores you," and raising his mug, which he had slyly
                  filled again, he drained it to the bottom.</p>
               <p>"Shut up, Jule, <emph>you</emph> don't know any thing about such big gentlemen,"
                  exclaimed the Captain.</p>
               <p>"I don't know nuffin 'bout any <emph>gemmen</emph> whot chaws 'backer," rejoined
                  the darky—who seemed to be a privileged character—"but I knows lots o' cap'ns whot
                  does it, and does it so bad dat I'se afeared dey'll neber git ober it, neber."</p>
               <p>"Captain," exclaimed the Parson, laughing heartily, "I've told you Jule is too
                  smart for <emph>you.</emph> But come, old fellow, hurry up that dinner—I'm as
                  hungry as a bear."</p>
               <p>The negro slowly picked himself up and waddled out of the tent.</p>
               <p>"That darky is no fool," I remarked, when he had gone.</p>
               <p>"No, he is as smart as any white man I ever knew. He's of good stock. Though
                  dwarfed and misshapen, he has every mark of good blood about him," replied the
                  Chaplain.</p>
               <p>"What do you mean by 'good blood?' he's as black as midnight."</p>
               <p>"I mean he has a fine physical organization—as fine as a white man's. The souls of
                  all men, I take it, are essentially alike. Men differ only in organization. On a
                  fine organization the spirit acts more perfectly than on a coarse one. No player
                  can get as good music from a poor piano as from a good one. This accounts for the
                  inequality of mental development we see among men and races of men, and the same
                  difference that exists among the white races, exists among the black. Jule is one
                  of the superior grade."</p>
               <p>"I never heard that theory stated before," I replied; "but I have observed that
                  the negro with cucumber-shaped shin, baboon<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6527-00000041"
                  /> oon head and face, stooping shoulder and long heel, <emph>is</emph>
                  inferior—greatly so—to the one (however black he may be) of erect and well-formed
                  body, straight shin, and finely developed brain. I have known many of these last
                  that I have thought equal in mental and moral power to the better class of white
                  men."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Equal</emph> in mental and <emph>superior</emph> in moral power," said the
                  Parson. "It is useless for us to deny it; the better races of negroes are more
                  receptive of good influences, more familiar with the inmost experiences of faith,
                  and hope, and trust; more suitably organized to be the temples of the Holy Spirit
                  than our own race. They live close to God, are truly His children; their whole
                  souls go out to Him in prayer and worship, and some of them carry a halo always
                  about them, as if they daily saw 'the glory of God, and Jesus standing at His
                  right hand.'"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but is not some of this religious exaltation owing to their condition? They
                  cling to Christ because he is their <emph>all</emph>—they have literally nothing
                  else."</p>
               <p>"No, I think not. It is the result of organization. Day and Martin will, without
                  doubt, be at a premium on the 'other side of Jordan.' If St. Peter ever lets me
                  in, I reckon it will be because I shall hold on mighty hard to the coat-tail of
                  some old black saint, like Julius here. Eh, Jule?"</p>
               <p>"I reckons not, Massa Parson," replied the negro, who had re-entered, and was
                  loading the small table with eatables. "I reckons <emph>you</emph> kin git in fru
                  dat ar gate wid you' own legs and de grace ob God. But ef you can't—ef ole Peter
                  make any 'jection—Jule'll take you up ahind; you kin git up <emph>dar</emph>
                  (touching the huge hump on his back) an' ride slap inter glory like's ef you wus
                  drivin' you' own six hoss kerridge—you kin, Massa Parson—you may 'pend on
                  dat."</p>
               <p>A laugh followed, and in the midst of it we sat down to dinner. It consisted of
                  boiled ham, salt pork, corn bread, butter-milk, and strawberries, and on such
                  fare, seasoned as it was with hunger, exercise, and pleasant conversation, I made
                  a most hearty meal.</p>
               <p>"You belabored nigger worshippers, in your sermon," I said to the parson after a
                  time; "but it strikes me you're something of one yourself."</p>
               <p>"Not a bit of one," he replied; "I can see his good qualities, but I give the
                  negro precious little love or worship; the poor white man has all my sympathy, and
                  he needs it more than the black."</p>
               <p>"I know he is lower in intellect and morals than the negro."</p>
               <p>"Far lower. The slaveocrats have enslaved his mind as they have the other's body.
                  His degradation is almost past belief. The other day, I was strolling out a little
                  way beyond our lines, and came upon a young woman sitting in the doorway of a mean
                  hovel. She was as beautiful as Eve before she fell—as beautiful as I imagine the
                  angels are who bear parted souls to Heaven. She had long, auburn hair, which fell
                  over her neck like a veil of golden gauze, soft, liquid brown eyes, and features
                  that sculptors chisel for the world to look at. Raphael had a dim vision of such a
                  face, and made it immortal in the Madonna. She sat with her bare legs braced
                  against the door-jamb, and a little higher than her head; and the coarse cottonade
                  gown she wore disclosed the handsomest foot, ankle, and—shall I say it, Captain?"
                  and he paused abruptly, and turned to that gentleman.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; say it; never mind me," rejoined the Captain, with mock gravity.</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6527-00000042"/>
               <p>"Well then, the handsomest foot, ankle and <emph>knee,</emph> that can be found in
                  Tennessee."</p>
               <p>"The Parson's a judge of beauty, Sir," said the Captain. "In women and horses he's
                  a perfect connoisseur. He adores a handsome form, but a pretty leg enraptures
                  him."</p>
               <p>"And why shouldn't it? Woman is the most beautiful thing in creation, and a pretty
                  leg is a womanly feature—but we'll not discuss that. As I approached this
                  half-clad beauty she took an old tobacco pipe, blacker than the ace of spades,
                  from her mouth, and said to me: 'Stranger, howdy'ge? Ye haint got no 'backer 'bout
                  ye, hes ye?'</p>
               <p>"I pleasantly told her I did not use tobacco, when she put one of her pretty feet
                  to the ground (there was no floor to the cabin), and yelled out: 'Then gwo to ——,'
                  the hot place the Captain occasionally alludes to—'we haint no use for no sich old
                  saints as ye is, round yere!' I travelled off at double-quick, I assure you, but I
                  cursed in my heart the men and the system that had reduced so lovely a specimen of
                  my race and blood to such degradation."</p>
               <p>"But they are not all so degraded," said the Captain. "When I was a prisoner last
                  fall, I saw a good deal of them, and one of them aided me to escape. He fought
                  like a hero at Stone River, and is now by far the best man in my company."</p>
               <p>"Come, Captain; tell our friend your adventures with Tom in Secessia," said the
                  Parson.</p>
               <p>The Captain assented, and his story will be found in the next chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE CAPTAIN'S STORY.</head>
               <p>"IT is not much of a story," said the captain, drawing his chair away from the
                  table and lighting a huge cigar; "and, besides, I haven't the parson's handy way
                  of dressing up a common incident so as to make it fit for good society; but such
                  as it is, it is true."</p>
               <p>"But, Captain, as it's Sunday," said the preacher, smiling, "suppose you leave out
                  some of your favorite ornamental phrases; truth unadorned, you know, is adorned
                  the most."</p>
               <p>"Yes; but if you strip it stark naked you shock modest people. Why, Sir, if I used
                  as many oaths in my talk as the parson does in his sermons, I should expect the
                  earth to open and swallow me, as in ancient times it did that old secessionist,
                  Korah."</p>
               <p>"Come, come, you'll make your story like the parsonage my folks in Illinois built
                  for me—all porch and front-door. Get into it, and be brief; for life is short—and
                  I want Mr. —— to hear some of Jule's psalm-singing before he goes."</p>
               <p>The captain handed me a cigar, took a long whiff from his own, and without
                  noticing the preacher's remark, began his story:</p>
               <p>"It was after the great foot-race between Bragg and Buell, when old 'Slow-coach'
                  won the stakes—two States and—a<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6527-00000043"/>
                  court-martial; and we soldiers immortalized ourselves by using our legs instead of
                  our muskets. I was stationed at Gallatin in defence of the railway, and, being
                  short of fodder, took a squad of a dozen men one day, and went out on a foraging
                  expedition. I had sent six or seven wagon loads back to camp, and, with the
                  remaining wagons, was scouring the district around Hartsville, when, just after we
                  had set our pickets for the night, about two hundred of Forrest's cavalry came
                  suddenly on us, and surrounded and made us prisoners before we had even time to
                  run. A small party took us in charge, and striking a course due east, made for the
                  Knoxville Railroad. Nothing worth mention occurred during the first two days. At
                  the close of the second we reached a small village called Crossville—consisting of
                  two houses, a barn, and a nigger shanty—just in the edge of Bledsoe County, and
                  halted for the night. We took supper at the house of a well-to-do planter, of the
                  name of Boylan, who gave us a good meal, and was very courteous to the Confederate
                  officer, but, in my presence, cursed and swore at the Union, and the 'Linkum
                  hirelin's,' hard enough to have shocked—the parson. The lieutenant, who was a
                  social fellow and a gentleman, pressed me to share his bed at the house, but I
                  declined, asserting—not very mildly—that I wouldn't sleep under the roof of such
                  an old reprobate as the planter. The Rebel officer appreciated my feeling, and
                  lending me an extra blanket—for the night was cold—consented to my camping out
                  with my men—which meant sleeping in a corn-field, on the ploughed ground, with the
                  sky for a bedquilt. The boys had made a rousing fire of pineknots, and were eating
                  their suppers near it when I joined them. Spreading a blanket on the ground, and
                  seating myself before the roaring blaze, I lit my last cigar, and fell to studying
                  'Ayer's Cherry Pectoral Almanac,' a copy of which delightful work had somehow
                  lodged in the pocket of my overcoat. I was pondering its astrological predictions,
                  when a long, loose-jointed native came up to me, and said:</p>
               <p>"Wall, stranger, yer takin' it powerful cool, bein's yer in a purty clus fix."</p>
               <p>"Not a very <emph>close</emph> fix," I answered; "there's lots of room round
                  here."</p>
               <p>"Yas, lots uv it; but ye hain't the run o' the ground—though I 'spect ye would run
                  ef ye hed the chance."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>reckon</emph> I would."</p>
               <p>"Whot's thet yer readin' thar?"</p>
               <p>"An almanac."</p>
               <p>"Almynac! Whot's thet?"</p>
               <p>"A book that tells all about the weather; when it will rain and when it won't. A
                  man that carries one doesn't need an umbrella."</p>
               <p>"An' do it tell when it wull be fa'r fur shootin' snipe an' kotchin eels?"</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, it tells all that, and when husbands may 'look out for squalls.' If
                  you've a wife you ought to have one."</p>
               <p>"I hain't morrid. Number one ar' bout so much as I kin find in vittles. But thet
                  mus' be a monstrus nice book; ef I could spell, I'd spill a quart o' humin grease
                  ter git one."</p>
               <p>"'T would be worth that; but here, I'll give you this. You can learn to 'spell' it
                  somehow."</p>
               <p>"With a look of stupid surprise he took the almanac, but in a moment handed it
                  back, saying, 'I doan't mean ter 'pose on ye, stranger, beca'se yer kotched in the
                  tedders (tethers). I hain't no sech sort o' man, no how."</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6527-00000044"/>
               <p>"You'll not impose on me; you're welcome to it. Make your preacher learn you how
                  to read it."</p>
               <p>"Lord bless ye, the parson doan't know how no more'n I does. Ye see we hain't no

               <p>"Yes, I'd be glad to; but I go off in the morning."</p>
               <p>"But, 'spose we gwoed off tergedder," and he sunk his voice to a whisper; "ter
                  night—fru the bush—up thar—plumb ter Nashville."</p>
               <p>I looked steadily at him. There was truth in his face, and in a low tone I asked:
                  "To the death?"</p>
               <p>"Ter the death, stranger," and he gave me his hand; "I'll draw a jug uv
                  knock-em-stiff on the soger, an' ye kin mosey off 'fore the moon ar up. The
                  boss'll holp us."</p>
               <p>"Who is the 'boss?'"</p>
               <p>"The old man thar," pointing to the house.</p>
               <p>"Why, he's a red-hot Rebel."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! He do come the Rebel powerful strong, but thet's put on. He'd guv the
                  dingnation consarn a doze of collermy an' jollerp thet would clean out thar hull

               <p>"No doubt he will. All the promises of the Bible are to the poor man." (That
                  wasn't original; I had it from the parson.)</p>
               <p>He then went to the planter's house, and returned in a short time with a gallon
                  jug of whiskey. Coming directly to me, he said in a loud tone; "I say, Leftenant"
                  (I wore only one bar on my shoulder-straps then), "take a swig ter warm yer
                  innards."</p>
               <p>As I poured out the liquor, he whispered:</p>
               <p>"The old un' say ye mus' put plumb fur the branch; it'r 'bout half a mile frum
                  yere—measured with a coonskin, an' the tail throw'd in. Foller it up 'bout as
                  fur—the water's low, an' ye mus' gwo inter it, case they moight git the dogs onter
                  yer trail—an' ye'll come to a dade tree whot bends over the run. It's holler, an'
                  ye kin git inter it an stay thar agin I come, as snug as a bar in a snow-bank.
                  I'll prime the guard with knock-em-stiff—ye be along—an' when I shouts 'Glory,
                  glory,' twice, as ef the raal camp-meetin' power war on me, ye put fur the bushes
                  on yer han's an' feet, like a wurrum; an' when ye gits thar, pike off like
                  lightnin' chasin' a whirlygust" (hurricane).</p>
               <p>"I understand; but be cool and steady."</p>
               <p>"Cool? I'll be cooler nur Parson Plewit when death jerked him; an' they say he war
                  so cool he fruz the whole grave-yard so tight they hed ter thaw it out with
                  light'ood."</p>
               <p>Our camp was guarded by about a dozen sentinels, who relieved each other every six
                  hours. The one whose station was nearest the bushes that lined the northern side
                  of the corn-field, had built a fire of pine-knots, and every now and then halted
                  before it as he walked to and fro on his round. My way of escape lay through those
                  bushes, and to enable me to reach them unobserved my new friend would have to
                  engage this sentry at the fire long enough to "prime" him so "tight" that he would
                  be oblivious to my movements. This seemed no ordinary undertaking, for, aside from
                  the difficulty of luring him from his duty<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6527-00000045"
                  /> on the beat, the sentinel was a tough, raw-boned Kentuckian, who looked
                  whiskey-proof, and capable of "totein' a peck of licker." But no time could be
                  lost. It was already nine o'clock, and guard would be relieved at twelve; so the
                  native set himself at once about his spiritual labors.</p>
               <p>Approaching the fellow, jug in hand, he asked him to drink, and in an incredibly
                  short time had so worked on his affection for knock-em-stiff, that the Kentuckian
                  was seated cosily hobnobbing with him on a log before the fire. A greasy pack of
                  cards was soon brought out, and they went into euchre, seven-up, and
                  high-low-jack, every now and then relieving the card-playing with a horn, and one
                  of the toughest yarns that mortal man ever listened to. For a long time it seemed
                  doubtful which would conquer in this keen encounter of wits, for though Long
                  Tom—that is the name he goes by—is an incorrigible wag, and "immense" at telling a
                  story, the Kentuckian was no green hand at the business. They each seemed to own a
                  patent for lying, and to be running their inventive machines with no regard to
                  probability, credibility, or possibility. At last, when Tom had told of killing a
                  "sarpunt" whose body was as large round as a "whiskey-kag," and stretched across a
                  bridge thirty feet wide, with "ten foot lappin' onter the road," the Kentuckian
                  shook his head, and rather sadly exclaimed: "Jewhitiker! Thet war the most
                  oncommonest, rantankerous snake I uver yered on. I guv it up."</p>
               <p>"Ye mought as well," said Tom, with infinite composure, "fur he <emph>war</emph> a
                  most outdacious sarpunt."</p>
               <p>But all this time little progress had been made in getting the sentinel boozy. Mug
                  after mug of clear "blue ruin" had gone down his throat (and Tom's shirt-collar),
                  with no more apparent effect on him than if his stomach had been of cast-iron. At
                  last twelve o'clock came, and with it the relief-guard. When I saw him—another
                  tough, raw-boned Kentuckian—approach, hope fled, and a heavier feeling came, at my
                  heart than was ever there before. I had caught a glimpse of liberty, and captivity
                  seemed the drearier for it. However, hiding my disappointment, I turned to go to
                  where the boys were sleeping, when Tom shouted out:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Leftenant, doan't ye be a moseyin' off, we'se the hull night afore us. The
                  world warn't made in one day; it tuck six. I'll git some more licker, an' make ye
                     <emph>as snug as a bar in a snow-bank,</emph> yit."</p>
               <p>Giving the last of its contents to the new-comer, he then took the jug under his
                  arm and "moseyed off" to the house, while the relieved sentry again quietly seated
                  himself on the log. The latter evidently meant to levy on the fresh supply of
                  "sperrets," and I saw with consternation that my undaunted friend would have to
                  perform the almost impossible exploit of "flooring" two "double-lined,"
                  "fire-proof," Kentucky "whiskey-swillers" at once.</p>
               <p>Tom soon reappeared with the jug and three extra mugs—the previous drinking had
                  been done from one—and filling them to the brim, said, looking very hard at me:
                  "Now, let me guv ye a toast. Yere's ter Jeff. Davis, an' may he live so long as
                  the Lord'll let him."</p>
               <p>"I can't drink to that," I said, setting down my mug.</p>
               <p>"No more'n ye karn't, Leftenant! I nuver thort o' thet, so no 'fence. But, bein's
                  the toast's out, 'spose <emph>ye</emph> drink ter the next."</p>
               <p>I took his meaning at once. He had drugged the liquor.</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6527-00000046"/>
               <p>The cards were again brought out, but what "knock-em-stiff" could not do, laudanum
                  soon began to accomplish. The newcomer was the first to show its effects. He
                  played somewhat wildly for a time, then, swaying unsteadily on the log, rolled
                  heavily off to the ground. The other kept his seat a while longer, but when Tom,
                  plying him with a second "swig," swung his mug around his head and cried, "Glory!
                  glory!" he followed his "departed friend," and sunk into a sleep that "knows no
                  waking" for a half dozen hours.</p>
               <p>Giving me a strong grasp of the hand, the native pointed to the bushes. Wrapping
                  the blankets about me (the lieutenant's, I confiscated), and taking a last look at
                  the boys—it came awful hard to leave them—I lowered myself on my hands and knees,
                  and crawled to the fence. I reached it without detection, and soon arrived at the
                  branch, up which I waded, as directed by the native.</p>
               <p>The moon was just rising when I came upon the hollow tree, and I had no difficulty
                  in finding its opening. Its interior was fully eight feet in diameter, the trunk
                  being a mere shell, and was covered with a thick flooring of decayed wood. On this
                  I spread one of the blankets, and wrapping myself in the other, lay down to rest.
                  The excitement of the escape, and the long ride of the previous day, had so
                  fatigued me that I soon sank into a deep slumber. How long I slept I do not know,
                  but when I awoke the day was "about an hour by sun," and a small army of men and
                  dogs were howling outside of my retreat, as if a legion of infernal devils had
                  been let loose about me.</p>
               <p>"I tell you he has waded either up or down the run," said a voice I recognized at
                  once as that of the Rebel lieutenant; "the dogs don't track him over there. He
                  must have hid somewhere near the stream."</p>
               <p>"Lord bless ye, Leftenant, them dogs hain't wuth a tetocious d—n. They nuver nosed
                  nuthin more'n thar dinners. A man as wus pikein fur the Union lines, 'ud run
                  streter nur a seared wolf. I'd plank salvation agin a jack-knife thet his legs is
                  a dancin' a hurricane up thar, on Jim Potter's deadnin' (clearing) beyont the
                  mounting, at this pertic'lur minnet."</p>
               <p>I held my breath in torture. I have heard a thousand bullets whistling about me
                  without feeling the agony of suspense I endured during the next five minutes.
                  Soon, however, the voices died away, and before many hours I heard the faint
                  baying of the hounds miles off upon the "mounting." Tom had saved me!</p>
               <p>When the danger was over I lay down, and, overcome with the excitement, again fell
                  asleep. It was dark when my shoulder was touched lightly, and Tom whispered in my
                  ear: "It ar time ter be a moseyin' off, Leftenant. H—ll mought be tall lodgin's ef
                  the fire war out, but it ar too hot fur us jest now."</p>
               <p>I rose, and partaking of a hearty meal and fortifying myself with a liberal glass
                  of brandy—the planter had furnished us with a gallon jug of genuine
                  "Otard,"—sallied from my place of concealment. We struck directly for a wood, half
                  a mile distant, and worked our toilsome way over rocks and through underbrush and
                  laurel bushes all the night. In the morning we lay down by the side of a fallen
                  tree and went to sleep. Tom had brought provisions enough to last for two or three
                  days, by which time he hoped we should be clear of the neighborhood in which he
                  was known, and where the danger of detection was greatest. Travelling by the
                  woods, however, was slow, and if we kept to them, our supplies would be exhausted
                  before we reached the safer district of country. That night, therefore<pb
                     n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6527-00000047"/> fore, we took to the high road. We walked
                  till the sun rose without meeting any one, and then "camped out" in the bushes.
                  For two more days and nights we did the same, and then had arrived within twenty
                  miles of Nashville. Our provisions having then given out, Tom, in the small hours
                  of the morning, made a descent on a planter's smoke-house and supplied our larder
                  with two enormous hams. As he threw them into the thicket where I lay, he said to
                  me:</p>
               <p>"Won't them infernal nigs kotch it fur stealin' these critters. It'll sarve 'em
                  right; they orten't ter b'long ter no such durned hide-bound secesh."</p>
               <p>"How do you know he is a secessionist?"</p>
               <p>"By the taste o' the bacon. Ye nuver know'd no sech hog's-flesh as thet ter be
                  curn by a honest Union man. Why, it'r strong 'nuff ter knock ye down, an'
                  tough—it'r tougher nur the yarns dad used ter tell us boys uv cold nights, in the
                  old shanty on the dead'nin'."</p>
               <p>In the impatience of his hunger he had cut a slice from one of the hams with his
                  jack-knife, and eaten it raw on his way to "camp." A fire would have betrayed us,
                  so I drew out my knife, and followed his example. The meat <emph>was</emph> rather
                  rancid and very tough, but I never before tasted any thing half so palatable.
                  Hunger is a wonderful condiment. It has made me think a sirloin of mule superior
                  to the finest steak ever broiled.</p>
               <p>We lay close through the following day, but the next evening, before the sun was
                  well down—we were within twenty miles of <emph>freedom,</emph> and impatient to
                  get to it—carrying the hams under our arms, we resumed our journey. We took to the
                  highroad, but had not proceeded a mile before we met six men coming briskly
                  towards us. One was dressed as a Confederate sergeant, and had a gun on his
                  shoulder; the others wore the ordinary homespun of the district, and, having no
                  arms, seemed fresh recruits. Avoiding them was out of the question, so, cocking
                  our pistols in our pockets (Tom had confiscated the revolvers of the two sentinels
                  while they lay senseless on the ground), we went boldly forward. They eyed my
                  uniform very closely, but merely saying, "Good evenin'," passed us quietly. They
                  had not gone two hundred yards, however, before I heard the report of a musket,
                  and felt a sharp, burning sensation in my right side, near the shoulder. The
                  infernal sergeant had shot me! His ball entered at my back, and, making a half
                  circle, lodged on my breast-bone.</p>
               <p>Tom turned like an aroused panther, and sprang down the road after them, firing
                  his revolver as he ran. He overtook one, and brained him with his pistol-stock,
                  but the rest escaped. In the mean time I was bleeding profusely. I took out my
                  handkerchief and attempted to staunch the blood, but could not. I sat down on a
                  stone by the road-side, and tried to look death in the face, but somehow death
                  wouldn't be looked in the face. I was bleeding at a rate that in a few hours would
                  drain every drop of blood from my body, but I could not realize that I was to
                  die—then—there—only twenty miles from FREEDOM!</p>
               <p>Tom, returning in a few minutes, said to me:</p>
               <p>"Them fellers wull raise the deestrict, Leftenant, an' all Secesh wull be arter us
                  in no time. We mus' take ter the woods, and feed on hope an' tough ham till the
                  whirlygust ar over."</p>
               <p>"Tom," I said, "I'm badly hurt; too badly, I fear, to go any further. You take
                  care of yourself. You can escape; leave me here; they'll take me prisoner, but it
                  will be my best chance to get at a doctor."</p>
               <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6527-00000048"/>
               <p>"Hurt! Blisters and blamenation, so ye is!" he exclaimed, tearing open my coat,
                  and examining the wound. "Quick, Leftenant! guv me yer wiper—I hain't nary one, I
                  allers does thet bizness the nat'ral way. We must stop thet ter onst—ter
                  onst."</p>
               <p>Taking my handkerchief, he saturated it with the brandy, and bound it tightly
                  about my side. Then, squatting on his hands and knees, he said: "Git up thar, back
                  uppermos', and lay flat as a fritter. It'll holp the bleedin'."</p>
               <p>I submitted myself quietly to him, and in a moment he was coursing over the open
                  ground which lay between the road and the thick belting of woods we had recently
                  left, with a gait as firm and easy, and almost as fast, as that of my mare Bess.
                  As he went along, he every now and then broke out with some exclamation like the
                  following: "Whot d—n tetocious villuns ter hit a man in the back. D—n 'um! They
                  wus borned in tophet, an' they'll git thar agin, yit. I'll holp 'em on the way. I
                  wull! Leave ye, Leftenant? Ye doan't 'spose Tom's a secesh?—dinged, rottin-souled,
                  blue-blasted, son uv a Rebel, does ye? No! He's wuth ye, Leftenant—ter the
                  death—TER THE DEATH. Didn't he say it, an' d'ye uver know' Tom ter guv his word
                  an' broke it." Then, as he paused to draw breath, he added: "Yer more'n a y'arlin'
                  baby, but nuver ye fear; I hain't gin out; I kin outrun creation yit, an' guv it
                  two mile the start."</p>
               <p>And I think he could have done so, for in an incredibly short time he set me down
                  at our camping-ground of the previous night. Gathering some dried leaves for a
                  mattress, and covering me with a blanket, he looked again at my wound. The
                  bleeding had sensibly diminished, and, when more brandy had been applied, and I
                  had rested a while in a horizontal position, it ceased altogether. When he was
                  satisfied I was out of immediate danger, he said to me:</p>
               <p>"I leff thet ar bacon an' the 'tother blankets 'side the road, an' I mus' git 'em,
                  Leftenant, or we's gone up. I couldn't gwo it twice ter one smoke-house—the old
                  coon'll be watchin' on it ter night."</p>
               <p>"But wait till it's fully dark. It won't be safe to go now."</p>
               <p>"Safe now as uver; an' 'sides, I'se afeard o' the dogs. Ef the varmunts shud nose
                  them traps, we might as wull say our pray'rs ter onst. An' bein's thar hain't
                  more'n 'un chance in a thousan' uv thar not hev'n done it, s'pose ye be gittin' a

                  I's 'mazin pore at thet sort o' bizness."</p>
               <p>"But, Tom, if we're in such danger—go; secure your own safety while there's time.
                  You can do no more for me; so—go, at once."</p>
               <p>"Gwo, Leftenant? Tom nuver flinched, or showed his back ter a friend. Ef the thing
                  ar up with us, we'll see it out tergedder, loike men. I hain't no way purticler

                  ter the rare door, fur, though I'se pore, an' ign'rant, an' no sort o' 'count ter
                  nary one in all creation, HE knows I nuver hed no showin'—thet's I'se done the
                  best I could."</p>
               <p>As he said this his voice was as low and soft as a woman's, with an inexpressible
                  sadness in it which brought the tears to my eyes. I grasped his two hands, as I
                  replied:</p>
               <p>"God bless you, my <emph>friend!</emph> You're the noblest man I<pb n="96-97"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000049"/> ever knew. If I die, my last breath shall be a
                  prayer for you."</p>
               <p>He made no reply, but, turning away, dashed off through the bushes.</p>
               <p>His voice choking with emotion, the captain paused at this point in his narrative,
                  and the parson remarked:</p>
               <p>"He is a noble fellow, Mr. ——, and I don't wonder at the captain's attachment to
                  him; but Tom's affection for the captain is something not often seen in this
                  work-day world. I believe no mortal ever felt such devotion for another as he
                  feels for him."</p>
               <p>"Oh yas, dey hab, Massa Parson; <emph>I</emph>'se seed it;" exclaimed the old
                  black, who had resumed his seat on the ground; "My young massa, he got morrid, an'
                  de fuss munfh he feel like he'd eat his wife up; but de second munfh—he wish ter
                  de Lord he hed."</p>
               <p>"Speak when you're spoken to, Jule;" said the parson, restraining his inclination
                  to laugh, and trying to look stern.</p>
               <p>"And give me a mug of whiskey toddy, you old joker," added the captain, laughing
                  heartily.</p>
               <p>"Dar hain't anudder drap, Massa Cap'n," replied the negro, with a demure face.
                  "You's drunk ebery drap, ebery bressed drap, Massa Cap'n."</p>
               <p>"I have had but two mugs, you old toper. You have drunk it yourself. How much have
                  you had?"</p>
               <p>"Not more'n six, Massa Cap'n; an' dat hain't nuffin ob sech stuff as dis; you
                  knows dat, Massa Cap'n."</p>
               <p>"No, not for <emph>you:</emph> but get some more at once. This black Christian,"
                  he added, turning to me, "can stand liquor enough to float a ship."</p>
               <p>"But he's not to blame for the habit," I said, laughing. "It's 'one of the results
                  of slavery,' eh, Parson?"</p>
               <p>"I reckon it is," replied the preacher, joining in the general merriment; "but
                  Jule never gets drunk. However, his habit is a little expensive to us, as the
                  rapacious sutlers make us pay five dollars a bottle for decent whiskey. But,
                  Captain, go on with your story, or you'll not get through to-night."</p>
               <p>"The next hour," resumed the captain, "was the longest I ever knew; but it came to
                  an end at last, and Tom reappeared with the blankets and bacon. A party of a dozen
                  men, evidently in pursuit of us, were passing down the road, when, on his hands
                  and knees he reached it; but they did not perceive him, and having no dogs, did
                  not detect our 'camp equipage.'</p>
               <p>"Again dressing my wound, and wrapping the remaining blankets about me—for the air
                  grew very chilly as the night wore on—my companion sat down on the fallen log, in
                  the lee of which I was lying, and appeared to fall asleep. My wound had grown very
                  painful, and I was tossing uneasily about, unable to rest, when, at the end of
                  several hours, he raised his head, and said to me:</p>
               <p>"Leftenant, I luck'd round a leetle when I went fur the traps, an' thar hain't no
                  house'n nigher'n three mile, 'cept thet durned secesher's thet I stole the bacon
                  frum. Ye'll die ef ye doan't git under kiver. What shill we do?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Pray,</emph> Tom; I know the Lord will lead us out of this, if we ask Him
                  aright."</p>
               <p>"Then, 'spose ye tries yer hand at it, Leftenant; ye's more larnin', an' yer a
                  better man nur me."</p>
               <p>"Learning is not needed in asking of God. He sees the faintest wish of the heart,
                  and he grants it to his children."</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6527-00000050"/>
               <p>("Preaching is not my profession," said the captain, parenthetically; "but, near
                  as I then was to death, I felt very solemn, and I've no doubt I could have beaten
                  the parson at his own trade, and given him—as Tom would say—two in the game.")</p>
               <p>"Wall, ef wishin' ar prayin', Leftenant," replied Tom, "I'se bin a prayin' this
                  whole blessed night—uver sence I seed ye'd got a hole inter ye thet moight let the
                  life out. But the Lord doan't yere me—I doan't see no way out o' this but gwine
                  ter thet durned hide-bound secesher's, an' thet 'ud nuver do, nohow."</p>
               <p>"But you don't know that he is a secessionist."</p>
               <p>"Yas I does. I'd swar ter it on the bacon;" and, heaving a deep sigh, he went to
                  musing again.</p>
               <p>The night, though I thought it would never end, at last wore away, and the sun
                  came in through the trees. It had been up about two hours, and was warming even my
                  cold bed under the laurel leaves, when a voice directly over me suddenly
                  exclaimed: "Wh—wh—whot'm—you—doin' down dar?"</p>
               <p>It was a tall, stalwart negro man, who had come upon us from the side to which
                  Tom's back was turned. The latter was in a gentle doze, and did not hear his
                  approach, but the moment the black spoke he sprang to his feet, and, seizing him
                  by the collar, cried out; "Ye black thundercloud! whot does ye want yere?"</p>
               <p>The negro made no reply, but, drawing back, aimed a heavy blow at the native's
                  face. Tom caught it on his arm, and stepping aside, and making no effort to return
                  it, said with amazing coolness:</p>
               <p>"Come, none o' thet, ur I'll lay ye out without ben'fit o' clargy. We's friends
                  ter all sech black devils like ye; so sot down yere an' tell us who ye is. Sot ye
                  down," he added, as the black showed a disposition to disregard his injunction:
                  "Sot ye down! or I'll lamm ye till yer whiter nur Squire Robins' old mar, an' she
                  war so white ye couldn't see har by daylight, fur the fact wus—she war dead."</p>
               <p>The negro sat down. "Thet's a sensible feller," said Tom, "Now, whar d'ye
                  b'long?"</p>
               <p>"Ter Squar Gibbon, ober dar," replied the black, pointing sulkily in the direction
                  of the planter's.</p>
               <p>"An' didn't ye lose two hams frum the smoke-house las' night? an' didn't the squar
                  guv it ter ye nigs' loike blazes this mornin' fur a stealin' on 'em?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, he done dat, Massa."</p>
               <p>"Sarved ye right. It'll larn ye better'n ter steal agin. Hain't yer massa a durned
                  old secesh?"</p>
               <p>"He am dat, Massa, nuffin' else nur dat," replied the negro, grinning.</p>
               <p>"Didn't I tell ye, Leftenant?" cried Tom, in a triumphant tone, giving one of the
                  hams a contemptuous kick, "Didn't I tell ye I know'd it by the taste o' the
                  bacon?"</p>
               <p>The darky looked at the hams; and a sudden light seemed to break upon him, for he
                  shouted out, "Yah! yah! an' did <emph>you</emph> stole de bacon, Massa? Did
                     <emph>you</emph> done dat, Massa? Yah! yah!"</p>
               <p>"No, we didn't <emph>stole</emph> it; white men doan't steal; only ye cussed nigs
                  does thet. We <emph>kornfiscated</emph> it."</p>
               <p>The black looked at us as if he didn't know the exact difference between stealing
                  and confiscating; but he said nothing. Tom rested his head on his hand for a
                  moment; then, looking up, said to the negro:</p>
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6527-00000051"/>
               <p>"I say, thundergust, which'll ye take—death or yer freedom?"</p>
               <p>"I doan't 'zactly understand, Massa," replied the black, with more coolness than
                  he could have been expected to exhibit under Tom's eye, which startled even me
                  with its fierceness.</p>
               <p>"I mean thet we is Union men, 'scapin ter the lines; an' thet we'll take ye 'long,
                  an' guv ye yer freedom, ef ye'll holp us; an' <emph>kill ye, if ye woan't.</emph>
                  Thet's all."</p>
               <p>"I'll holp you, Massa. Ef you'm Union I'd do ut widout ony freedom, but, ob
                  course, Massa, I'd rudder hab dat."</p>
               <p>"Uv course ye w'ud; ony fool w'ud. Whot der ye think, Leftenant? Kin we trust the
                  nig?"</p>
               <p>"I think so; I like his face," I replied.</p>
               <p>"So does I. But, my black booty, ye jest 'count on it, ef ye come the varmunt over
                  us ye'll kotch fryin' pans over a slow fire: ye wull. Wull ye 'member thet?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yas, Massa. But neber you f'ar, Massa, I'll be true. Shore, Massa."</p>
               <p>"I'll trust ye," said Tom, at once proceeding to talk affairs over with the darky.
                  We ascertained from him that the district was filled with Union men, who would
                  gladly aid us, but they all lived at too great a distance to be safely reached in
                  my wounded condition. A poor white man, however, who could be trusted, had a small
                  "dead'nin'" about a mile away, and to him we determined to apply. The negro set
                  off at once for his house—which stood on a narrow wagon track running through the
                  woods—and in about an hour returned with the native.</p>
               <p>He was an odd-looking specimen of humanity, with a lean, gaunt frame, round,
                  stooping shoulders, short, crooked figure; long, bony arms, and knees that seemed
                  to love each other. His eyes were small and restless; his nose long, thin, and
                  hooked at the end; and his ears large enough to have been intended for a quadruped
                  renowned for braying. He wore a pair of pants made of butternut linsey, a coat and
                  shirt of the same material, and an old broad-brimmed slouched hat, turned up in
                  front, and falling over his shoulders like the cape of a Mackintosh.</p>
               <p>He at once consented to receive me into his house, and to keep me until my wound
                  was sufficiently healed to allow of my again setting out for Nashville. "I'se
                  mighty pore fixins, stranger," he said; "but whot I hes ar' yourn, ter
                  komand."</p>
               <p>My wound had become greatly inflamed, so that the least motion gave me
                  excruciating pain, and attempting to rise, I found myself too weak to stand.
                  Perceiving this, Tom and the negro, making a seat of their arms, took me up and
                  carried me to the native's. His cabin was of the meanest sort, and, for effectual
                  concealment, my bed was made in one corner of its half-floored attic; but his
                  kindness, and that of his tidy, tender-hearted wife, with Tom's never-ceasing
                  attention, made those mean lodgings as pleasant as quarters under a much more
                  pretentious roof.</p>
               <p>As soon as I could bear the pain, Tom extracted the ball with his jack-knife; but
                  my strength returned slowly. It was ten days before I could sit up. Then I gave
                  Tom his first lessons in the alphabet, putting Ayer's Almanac to a much better use
                  than it was ever put to before.</p>
               <p>At the end of a fortnight we held a general consultation over affairs, and
                  decided, as it might be weeks before I was able to travel, that Tom should attempt
                  to make his way to Nashville, with letters to my colonel. They would probably
                  induce him to send a party of cavalry to my rescue.</p>
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6527-00000052"/>
               <p>Tom reached Nashville safely, and just after dark one evening, about a week
                  afterward, I was gladdened by the sound of his voice entering the cabin. In a
                  moment more his good-looking face, lit up by the blaze of the roaring light-wood
                  fire on the hearth below stairs, shone out at the top of the rickety ladder which
                  led to my lodging place. "I'se done it, Leftenant," he cried. "They's over ter
                  Squire Gibbon's, kornfiscatin' Jake an' a fass hoss an' kerridge. They'll be yere
                  in a jiffin, so ye be up an' ready."</p>
               <p>I soon dressed myself, and mounting Tom's back, descended to terra-firma. In half
                  an hour I heard the clatter of horses' hoofs, and turning to my kind friends,
                  said: "I have been a prisoner, you know, and therefore have no money about me; but
                  I shall not forget you—you shall not go unrewarded."</p>
               <p>"Nuver tork in thet how, Cunnel," replied the native. (He persisted in calling me
                  colonel, though he knew my rank.) "Yer guvin' yer life ter the kentry, an' it war
                  a rantankerous shame ef we couldn't guv ye whot leetle ye's hed."</p>
               <p>I said no more, but grasping him by the hand, and kissing his wife—she was a young
                  and pretty woman—I walked to the door and took a seat by the side of Jake, the
                  colored man, in the "kornfiscated" buggy. A "kornfiscated" horse, ready saddled,
                  stood beside it. Tom mounted him and we rode off to Freedom. We reached Nashville
                  before daybreak, and—that is the end of my story."</p>
               <p>"Give the captain some punch, Jule," said the parson; "he must be dry after
                  spinning so long a yarn."</p>
               <p>As the captain took the toddy I said to him: "And you say Tom is a member of your
                  company now?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, he enlisted with me as soon as I recovered from my wound. At Stone River he
                  fought like a hero, and when they promoted me, they gave <emph>him</emph> a
                  shoulder-strap."</p>
               <p>"Then, he's an officer now."</p>
               <p>"Second Lieutenant in my company. His tent isn't half a dozen rods from here."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I should very much like to know him. He is a character."</p>
               <p>"And a wag of the first water," said the parson; "if you talk with him, and don't
                  keep your wits about you, he'll 'sell' you, sure."</p>
               <p>"I'll look out for that. Pray let me see him."</p>
               <p>The Captain went out, and in a few moments returned with the "native." My
                  interview with him, and some of the yarns he spun, are narrated in the next
                  chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE POOR WHITE MAN.</head>
               <p>THERE are two classes of poor southern whites, of marked and decidedly opposite
                  characteristics. The type of the one is of low stature, with abbreviated body,
                  elongated arms and legs, dull heavy eyes, coarse carroty hair, saffron-hued skin,
                  and a small head, shaped like a cocoa-nut. The type of the other is tall, and well
                  formed, with a gaunt, loose-jointed frame, a rough dark skin, wiry black hair,
                  keen restless eyes, and an artless, confiding manner, which, with a certain air of
                  self-possession, indicates that he knows little of the world, but feels fully able
                  to cope with what little he does know. The first is physically and intellectually
                  a "bad job," and it might sensibly be questioned why he was created, for he
                  appears incapable of either mental or moral culture; but the other possesses all
                  the "raw material" of manhood—and manhood, too, of the noblest type. Education,
                  discipline, social advantages, and political freedom are needed to bring out his
                  nature, but when it is brought out he shows himself a Man. The first class, who
                  are few in number, and fast melting away before the advance of a stronger race,
                  and a more robust civilization, are found principally on the Sandhills of North
                  Carolina, and in the mountain regions of Lower Virginia and Upper Georgia. There,
                  a little above "the brutes that perish," and a "long way lower down dan de
                  darkies," they build their pole cabins, and glean a sorry subsistence from hunting
                  ing, fishing, and a few sterile acres. The other class, who are counted by
                  millions, and are scattered from the Potomac to the Rio Grande, are the bone and
                  sinew of the South, the prop of Slavery, and the hope and expectation of Freedom,
                  for on them, more than on immense armies or garrisoned cities, will depend the
                  safety and perpetuity of the Union. An unprincipled aristocracy has robbed them of
                  knowledge, and moulded them to its own base uses, but whenever truth has reached
                  them they have shown an unselfish devotion to it, and to the Union, which we
                  time-servers and money-lovers of the North know nothing of. In East Tennessee,
                  where Parson Brownlow has been their great apostle, and <title>The Knoxville
                     Whig</title> their Bible and spelling-book, they have exhibited a heroic
                  patriotism which the world—I say this with a very small smattering of history—has
                  seldom witnessed. The deeds they have done, the sacrifices they have made, the
                  sufferings they have endured for a Government which has closed its eyes to their
                  sorrows, and its ears to their complaints, will be read of and wondered at, when
                  this generation has passed away. Their story is not yet told, but when it is told,
                  many a cheek will mantle with shame—as mine has—to hear of what these poor,
                  unlettered men, women, and children have done and suffered for their country,
                  while we have been growing fat on its necessities, and looking idly on, as it
                  seemed tottering to its ruin.</p>
               <p>From this latter class sprang Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson,
                  Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, Andrew Johnson, Parson Brownlow, President Lincoln,
                  and—Long Tom, whom "the captain" told the reader something about in my last
                  chapter.</p>
               <p>The "native" gentleman entered the tent with a quick, energetic<pb n="106-107"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000054"/> getic step, and bowing respectfully to the parson,
                  and giving me a grasp of the hand and a cordial. "How dy'ge, stranger?" turned
                  suddenly on the old negro, with:</p>
               <p>"Wall, old thundergust, how's ye?"</p>
               <p>"I'se well 'nuff," replied the black, giving his shoulder a petulant shrug.</p>
               <p>"Go to the colonel's, Jule, and borrow a chair for the lieutenant," said the
                  captain.</p>
               <p>The negro glanced inquiringly at the parson, but seeing no answering look in his
                  face, turned his head away, and, again shrugging his shoulders, replied:</p>
               <p>"Leff him gwo hisseff; Jule 'tends on gemmen: he doan't 'tend on no poo' white
                  trash—he doan't."</p>
               <p>"Thet's yer Christun sperret, ye black hyppercrit," rejoined the native, laughing,
                  and at the same time drawing the captain's traveling trunk from the corner, and
                  seating himself upon it. "One of these days I'll show ye how we white Christuns
                  guvs good fur evil, fur I'll tend on <emph>ye</emph>—I'll <emph>bury</emph> ye! an
                  I woan't pile more'n six inches o' sile on yer bones, so ye'll hev a right easy
                  time gittin up ter the resumrection."</p>
               <p>As the "native" took his seat I glanced at his appearance. He seemed somewhere
                  between twenty-five and thirty, and was about six feet three inches high, with
                  well-formed limbs, finely developed frame, clear, dark eyes, and a broad, full
                  forehead. His face was open, frank, and manly, and there played about it a mingled
                  expression of kindness and sadness, which was strangely blended with a latent
                  mirth, that seemed ready to break out on the slightest provocation.</p>
               <p>As he seated himself he turned to me, and in an abrupt, energetic tone, said:</p>
               <p>"Wall, stranger, the capt'n sez ye'd loike ter luck at me; so, I's yere. I's six
                  foot three, without leathers, weigh a hun'red an' eighty, kin whip twice my heft
                  in Secesh, bars, or rattlesnakes, an' uvry inch on me ar yourn ter komand, ef ye
                  gwoes in, body an' boots, fur the Union; an' the capt'n reckons ye does, though he
                  sez ye gwoes it the talkin', an' not the fightin' way: an' I ruther 'spect ye
                  Yankees 'ud gin' rally 'bout as lief talk as fight."</p>
               <p>"I had much rather," I replied, laughing; "but I reckon <emph>you</emph> might do
                  a little talking, if you tried."</p>
               <p>"My old muther allers said I hed suthin' uv a tongue. She use ter 'clare ter
                  gracious it war hung in the middle, an' hed a way uv gwine at both eends; an' yet
                  somehow, it nuver done me no good. But whar dy'ge b'long, stranger?"</p>
               <p>"In New York."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yas, I's hearn uv thet place. Up thar Nurth, clus ter the Nurth Pole, hain't
                  it?"</p>
               <p>"Not very close to the Pole, but in that direction."</p>
               <p>"An' hes ye uver seed the Nurth Pole?"</p>
               <p>"No, I never saw it, but I believe there is such a thing,"</p>
               <p>"An' whar mought it be?"</p>
               <p>"It 'mought' be here, but it is'nt;" I replied, smiling "Boston is the 'hub of the
                  universe'—I reckon it's there."</p>
               <p>"It mus' be a rantankerous Pole. How big d'ye 'spose it ar'? Big as thet ar
                  maple?" pointing to the tree under which the parson had preached his sermon, and
                  which was visible from the doorway of the tent.</p>
               <p>"Larger than ten of that placed one on the other, and spliced at top and
                  bottom."</p>
               <p>"Jerusalamm! but it ar a pole! D'ye know I's made out whot the yerth has sech a
                  thing fur?"</p>
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6527-00000055"/>
               <p>"No, why is it?"</p>
               <p>"Fur steerin'! I's bin on the Big Drink (Mississippi) an' seed how they does it.
                  But, Parson, it upsots whot ye sez 'bout the yerth bein' round."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed the chaplain, laughing; "and if the earth isn't round, how is
                  it shaped?"</p>
               <p>"Loike a steambut, ter be shore," replied the native, with a gravity so well
                  assumed that, for a time, it deceived even the parson; "hain't ye seed them ar big
                  poles 'at the fore' as they call it, uv the buts on the Big Drink; an' how them
                  fellers at the wheel plumbs thar coorse by 'em. Now, ef the yerth hev' un' o'
                  them, doan't it nat'rally foller thet it's shaped loike a steambut? An' I
                     <emph>knows</emph> it ar', 'case I's bin whar I c'ud luck slap down over the
                  side, right onter the most relarmin', purpindiclar presurpiss ye uver seed, even
                  in yer dreams."</p>
               <p>Amid the general laugh which followed, I asked:</p>
               <p>"And how did you get a sight at that 'relarmin', presurpiss'?"</p>
               <p>"I'd tell ye, but it'r a mighty long story."</p>
               <p>"Never mind its length, Tom," said the chaplain, "tell it."</p>
               <p>"Wall, ye sees," said Tom, taking a 'swig' at the toddy, and coolly lighting one
                  of the captain's cigars; "I war a livin' long uv dad, over thar in Bladsoe, whar I
                  war raised; an' un' mornin' dad sez ter me, sez he, 'Tom, hitch up the two-yar-old
                  he'ffer, an' fotch a load o' light-'ood frum the mounting.' Now, dad hed a small
                  dead'nin' up thar thet we wus a clarin' uv timber; so I hitched up the cow-brute,
                  an' piked fur the mounting. I'd wuckd till 'bout a hour by sun, an' hed got the
                  cart chock heapin' with pine knots an' timber, when I sot down onter it ter eat up
                  whot war left uv my dinner—fur I know'd ef I tuck it hum, an' dad seed it, my
                  supper'd be brevurated jest so much. Wall, I war jest a swollerin' down the last
                  mossel, when, thinkin' it war 'bout time ter be a hitchin' up the heffer, I luk'd
                  round, an' whot d'ye 'spose I seed? Two on the most oncommonest, riproarin' big
                  cart-wheel snakes ye uver hearn on in all yer borned days, an' they pikin' stret
                  fur me!"</p>
               <p>"And what is a cart-wheel snake?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"Why, it ar a sarpunt 'bout twelve foot long, thet hes a way uv kotchin' its tail
                  in its mouth—leavin' a small eend out fur a snapper; an' crackin' on it, when it
                  travils, jest loike we cracks a whip—an then roalin' itself over the ground loike
                  it war a cartwheel. Wall, I seed them ar two outdacious varmunts a comin' onter
                  me, an' I sez ter myself: 'Tom, you hain't got no fambly—an' thet's 'mazin' lucky
                  fur the fambly—but as a lone critter, as yer Arnt Sal use ter say uv herseff, ye'r
                  gone up, sartin'. An' I thort I war, but the Lord know'd better, fur he seed this
                  war wus a cummin', an' he know'd I'd be uv some use in guvin' the Rebels—brimstun.
                  Ye sees, Parson, I's a larnin' ter leave out the tough words."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I see," said the chaplain; "you're improving fast in everything
                  but—lying."</p>
               <p>"Lyin'," echoed Tom, in an injured tone, "I nuver lied in all my born days—'cept
                  ter Stun River; an' thar I lied fur two all-fired long nights—in the mud up ter my
                  knees. Ye 'scaped thet sin, Parson, 'case ye hed brush fur beddin'."</p>
               <p>"And I had you to thank for it. Tom, you <emph>are</emph> a trump—the very Jack of
                  clubs."</p>
               <p>"Thank ye, Parson. I sots high on yer 'pinion 'bout uvrything 'cept hoss flesh;
                  but in thet, I does 'sist—agin the capt'n—thet ye doant know a mule from a pile o'
                  light'ood. But<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6527-00000056"/> 'bout them snakes. They
                  come stret at me, an' luckin' me squar in the eye fur a minnit, licked thar big
                  jaws with thar forked tongues, as much as ter say: 'Ye'll make a right nice
                  mossel, ye wull,' an' then kiled themselves right tight round the cart-wheels. I
                  didn't 'spicion whot they wus a gwine 'bout, fur, 'lowin' <emph>I'd</emph> make a
                  right smart meal fur 'um, I didn't see whot yerthly use they hed fur the
                  light-'ood. Howsomever, they know'd best, an' in less time nur it takes to tell
                  it, they'd hitched up, an', with the hull apparitus—cart, light-'ood, an' all—war
                  tossin' thar heads, an' crackin' thar whips, an' moseyin' fur sundown streter nur
                  lightin' uver shot from a thunder-cloud. Ye'd better b'lieve they traviled. They
                  piked over the roads, an' through the clarin's, buckletewhit, splittin' the a'r
                  clean in two, an' leavin' a tornado we kotched up with so fur ahind thet I reckon
                  it haint got thar yit."</p>
               <p>"But how did they manage the shafts of the cart all this time?" I asked. "I should
                  think they would have caught in the bushes."</p>
               <p>"Oh, the snakes knowed too much fur thet; they turned the cart clean round, and
                  toted it hind eend afore."</p>
               <p>"They were sensible snakes!"</p>
               <p>"Ye nuver said a truer word nur thet, stranger. Wall, as I sot thar, gwine to'ards
                  sundown at thet relarmin' rate, with thet bore-constructor sort uv a team, I jest
                  hed time ter think, an' sez I ter myself: 'Tom, ye haint much larnin', but ye
                     <emph>is</emph> a outdacious, dingnation, nat'ral-borned fool, ef ye karn't
                  outwit two sech flat-noggin sarpunts as these is.' I hedn't more' n got the words
                  out'n my mouth when the new moon riz up 'bove the hoorizon, right afore me, an'
                  not more'n a mile off, with its two horns a stickin' out, as much as ter say:
                  'Now, Tom—new's yer chance. Jest guv a long leap; git up yere, an' take a tower
                  clar round creation fur nuthin'.' I did'nt need more'n thet hint, so I squatted on
                  my haunches fur a jump, an' when we'd come within a quarter uv a mile uv the moon,
                  I guv a spring, an', d'ye b'lieve it, I landed right squar' on the lectle eend uv
                  one uv the horns. The snakes they run out thar tongues, an' spit fire a leetle,
                  but seein' it warn't no use, they turned squar' round, piked back ter the deadin',
                  and left the cart right whar they found it."</p>
               <p>"But I thought you said the snakes had a use for the light wood?" I remarked, with
                  decent gravity.</p>
               <p>"Wall, they hed; they kalkerlated on it fur cookin' my carcass;but bein's I'd
                  skedaddled, they toted it back, like honest snakes, as they wus.'</p>
               <p>"And then you saw that uncommon 'presurpiss?'" asked the parson.</p>
               <p>"Yas," answered Tom. "As the moon sailed 'way frum the yerth, I lucked down; an'
                  Parson, ye'd better b'lieve it, I seed a more abysfuller place than ye uver told
                  on in all yer sarmunts. 'Twar so deep it 'peared ter stretch ter the vury eend uv
                  creation, an' so dark, ye moight hev read fine prent in it by the light o' sech a
                  black thing as Jule's face."</p>
               <p>"And how long did you sit there on the horn of the moon?"</p>
               <p>"Why, bless ye, stranger, it warn't no horn at all. It war on'y the small eend uv
                  a church steeple, that riz up nineteen mile frum the ground, an' stuck out jest
                  fur anuff fur me ter kotch a hold on as I wus a gwine by."</p>
               <p>"Then there are people living in the moon?"</p>
               <p>"I reckon thar is, an' the tallest people ye uver heered on. I doan't mean tall in
                  statur'—fur they haint much ter brag on<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6527-00000057"/>
                  thet way, an' I war a sort o' curiosity 'mong 'em, on 'count uv my hite—but tall
                  uvry other how. They showed me more hosspetality then I uver 'spect ter see agin;
                  toted me round in a rantankerous big kerridge shaped jest loike a coffin; an'
                  treated me ter mint-juleps 'nuff ter flood all creation in the driest spell ye
                  uver know'd on."</p>
               <p>"An' Mister Tom," said the old black, who had listened to the "native's" yarn
                  without moving a muscle of his broad face, which seemed made for grinning. "Bein's
                  you's bin dar, will you hab de goodness ter say whot dem ar dark places am dat we
                  sees in de moon?"</p>
               <p>"Nigger kentries, Mr. Midnight," replied Tom, promptly. "They doan't let darkies
                  'sociate with white folks up thar. They hard (herd) 'um all tergether, an' thar's
                  so many on 'em they make the air black as a thunder-cloud, which is the reason why
                  we sees 'um frum yere. An' we'll do the same with ye nigs in this wurle when the
                  war ar over. We'll turn yer hull race inter South Car'lina, an' I reckon ye'll
                  blacken the a'r down thar so loike durnation thet they'll obsarve it 'way off ter
                  the furdrest eend uv the univarse, an' see thar's been a rev'lution down yere
                  thet's altered the very face o' the planet."</p>
               <p>The black shrugged his shoulders contemptuously as he replied: "Whot fools ye poo'
                  white folk kin make o' yourselves. Loike as ef Tennessee nigs 'ud 'sociate wid dem
                  white trash an' mean chivarly down dar in Soufh Car'lina. You knows better'n
                  dat—we hain't got so low as dat yit."</p>
               <p>"And, Tom," I asked, "how long were you on the moon, and how did you get off?"</p>
               <p>"I karn't 'zactly say how long I war thar, case, ye see, thar hain't no clocks on
                  thet planet, nur no Yankees ter make 'um:" and he looked slyly at me, while the
                  parson broke into a broad laugh, saying:</p>
               <p>"You owe him one, Mr. ——."</p>
               <p>"I acknowledge the debt," I replied; "but, Tom, can no one but a Yankee make a
                  clock?"</p>
               <p>"No 'uns but them kin make 'ooden nutmegs, bass'ood hams, an' clocks thet woant
                  gwo. They makes nuthin' else."</p>
               <p>"That may be true, my good fellow; but they make them expressly for the southern
                  market. No other people are green enough to buy them."</p>
               <p>"Wall, stranger, I reckon I owes <emph>ye</emph> one now, I nuver know'd nary

                  clock. Shill I tell ye 'bout it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but finish the moon story first."</p>
               <p>"It hain't a minnet long, an' I kin eend the moon in a jiffen. Ye sees, dad hed
                  nary clock, an' couldn't tell when the sun riz—he hed a great reespect fur the
                  sun, nuver got up afore it in all his life—so, when a peddler come 'long with a
                  whole wagin-load uv clocks, he war drefful put ter't ter ter hev one. They wus the

               <p>"Wall, dad tuck the clock, and the peddler tuck the money and mosey'd off."</p>
               <p>"Dad sot druffel high on thet clock. He took on over it fur all the wurle, jest
                  like a chile over a new playthin'. He got up airlier, an' sot up later then I uver
                  know'd him afore, jest ter yere it strike, but arter a few days it stopped
                  strikin', an' nuver struck agin! Dad wus sold—an' sold, too, by a rantankerous
                  Yankee; an' dad allers 'counted (but mind, stranger, I doan't guv this as my
                  'pinion) thet a Yankee ar a leetle the measliest critter in all creation. Wall,
                  not more'n a month arter thet, as dad an' I wus a wuckin' in the corn patch 'un
                  day, who shud come 'long the road but the Yankee peddler. As soon as dad seed him
                  he sez ter me, sez he: 'Bullets an' blisters, Tom! but thar's thet outdacious
                  Yankee! Now, ef I doan't strike better time on his noggin then his dingnation
                  clocks uver struck in all thar lives, I'll pike stret fur kingdom-come, ef I hes
                  ter gwo afoot." Bilin' with wrath, dad moseyed fur the peddler; but he hedn't
                  more'n got inside 'o hearin', 'fore the Yankee bawled out: 'I say, Mister, ye's
                  got a clock as b'longs ter me. It woan't gwo, an' I want's ter get it, an' guv ye
                  'un as wull gwo. I hed jest 'un bad one in the lot, an' I'se bin a sarchin' fur it
                  'mong nigh onter a hun'red folks I'se sold clocks ter, an hain't found it yit, so
                  ye mus' hev tucken it; I knows ye did, case I sees it in yer eye.'</p>
               <p>"That mellored dad ter onst, an' ter own the truth, it guv <emph>me</emph> a sort
                  o' good 'pinion uv the Yankee. Wall, dad and he swopped clocks, an' the peddler
                  stayed ter dinner—an' the old man 'udnt take a red fur't, he war so taken with
                  him. As he wus a gwine ter leave, the peddler ope'd the hind eend uv his wagin,
                  an' takin' out a peck measure, heapin' full of whot 'peared the tallest oats thet
                  uver grow'd, he sez ter me, sez he: 'Tom, ye an' yer farder hes bin 'mazin clever
                  ter me, an' I nuver loikes ter be obligated ter no body, so yere's some o' the
                  finest plantin' oats ye uver know'd on; take 'um; they'll grow ye a monstrous tall
                  crop, as big as oak trees.'</p>
               <p>"Now ye sees, I hed a four-year-old mar I'd a raised up with my own han's. I sot
                  drefful high on har, an' she got drefful high on oats, an' I'd bin a savin' up
                  them two dollars s'pressly ter buy seed ter make a crap fur her privat' eatin'.
                  So, when I seed them oats o' the peddler's they filled my eye, loike the camel
                  filled the eye of the needle in Scriptur'. He hedn't guv'n me 'nuff ter gwo no
                  distance in plantin', but bein' he war so gen'rous loike, I couldn't ax him ter
                  guv more, so I sez ter him: 'Stranger, wouldn't ye sell a bushel o' them
                  oats?'</p>
               <p>"'Wall, Tom,' he sez; 'bein's it's ye, an' ye an' yer farder is sech monstrous
                  clever folk, I doan't know but I'd sell ye the <emph>whole</emph> on 'um, fur the
                  fact ar' they's too hearty loike fur my hoss; ye see the feller's got a sort o'
                  weak stomach, an' can't 'gest 'um. I guess thar's nigh on ter five bushel, an'
                  bein's they hain't uv no use ter me, ye shill have the whole on 'um fur them ar'
                  two dollars o' yourn.' Now, I figger'd on my fingers, an' foun' thet warn't more'n
                  forty cents a bushel; an' oats, sech as war raised in our diggins, an' they warn't
                  no way nigh so nice as them—went fur sixty, so ye kin reckon I tuck 'um, an' ye
                  mought b'lieve it rained big blessin's on thet peddler 'bout the time he druv off.
                  He'd altered my 'pinion o' the Yanks' 'pletely, an' I<pb n="116-117"

                  munag'ree, an travil the whole southin kentry, jest ter show folk whot the Yankees
                  raaly is; fur I know'd ef he done it they'd swap thar 'pinions jest as I hed, an'
                  thet ye know would do a mighty heap to'ards perpertratin' the Union. Wall, arter
                  he war gone, I tuck the five bushel inter the house, an' kivered 'um up keerful in
                  the cock-loft; but, feelin' mighty gen'rous loike, on 'count uv my big bargin', I
                  thor't I'd guv the mar a sort o' Christmus dinner o' the peck measure full. So I
                  put 'um afore her, an' she smelled on 'um ravernous mad fur a minnet, but then she
                  turned up har nose, an' wouldn't luck at 'um agin."</p>
               <p>"She found them too hearty loike; I suppose," I said, restraining a strong
                  inclination to laugh.</p>
               <p>"I 'spose she did, an' I reckon they <emph>would</emph> hev bin raather hard o'
                  'gestion, fur they wus SHOE PEGS!"</p>
               <p>"Shoe pegs?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, shoe pegs! The durnation Yankee hed a scowrn the hull deestrict, an' found
                  no 'un green 'nuff ter buy 'um, but me."</p>
               <p>Amid the general laugh which ensued, I asked:</p>
               <p>"And how about the clock? how did that turn out?"</p>
               <p>"'Twus wuss nur 'tother—it nuver struck onst."</p>
               <p>"Well that Yankee was smart," said the captain. "It takes a smart one to get ahead
                  of you, Tom."</p>
               <p>"He didn't git ahead uv me," replied Tom, with comic indignation. "I wus three
                  dollars inter him when I got shut o' them oats. Ye sees, I toted 'um ter
                  Pikeville, an' sold 'um fur whot they raaly wus—shoe pegs—an' got five dollars fur
                  the lot. The peddler mought hev done it, ef he could onyhow hev brought his mind
                  to act honest, but he'd ruther cheat fur half price, nur trade fa'r fur full pay.
                  An' thet's the sort o' Yankee ye's sent 'mong us, Stranger. They's done a heap
                  to'ards guvin us a bad 'pinion on ye, an' brungin' on this war."</p>
               <p>"I know they have. I blush to think I was born on the same planet with some of
                  them. But, Tom, about getting down from the moon. How did you do that?"</p>
               <p>"Why," replied Tom, with a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sang froid</foreign> that was
                  perfectly inimitable, "I jest waited till the moon come round ter the yerth agin,
                  an' when it got 'bout over dad's dead'nin', I let myself drap, an' landed squar in
                  the yam-patch, sound as ye sees me. I moseyed fur home, an' told dad whar I'd bin;
                  an' dad sez ter me, sez he: 'Bully fur ye, Tom; yer a raal chip o' the old block;
                  ye kin travil or spin a yarn nigh up ter yer fader, an' thet's sayin' a heap.' An'
                  it war sayin' a heap, for dad could lie loike a parson."</p>
               <p>After the merriment which followed Tom's stories had subsided, I said to him:</p>
               <p>"Speaking of riding round the moon in that 'kerridge' so like a coffin, reminds me
                  of once travelling in a coffin myself."</p>
               <p>"An' how wus it, stranger," asked Tom; "d'ye b'lieve ye kin tell a bigger story
                  than thet 'bout the moon?"</p>
               <p>"Not a bigger one, but one a little—<emph>truer.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Ef ye kin come ony nigher the truth then thet an' not hit it, I'd loike ter hev
                  ye."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll try, but I shall hit it—a thing I reckon you seldom do. It was late in
                  November, twelve years ago. I was coming from Florida with Edward C. Cabell, the
                  Confederate general who is now giving us so much trouble in Arkansas. It had
                  rained very hard all day, and when, at dark, we reached Albany—a little town in
                  South-Western Georgia—we found the<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6527-00000060"/>
                  Flint River had risen twenty-five feet. It poured down all that night, and in the
                  morning we learned that the stage, which was to have taken us to Oglethorpe—the
                  terminus of the Savannah Railroad—had not arrived, and that the bridges over all
                  the streams for miles around had been swept away by the freshet. This was
                  unpleasant news to both of us, for Cabell was anxious to be in Washington at the
                  opening of Congress (of which he was a member), and important business demanded my
                  immediate attention in Savannah. Crossing the streams we supposed to be
                  impossible; so we decided to take a horse, buggy, and negro driver, and attempt to
                  head them in the up-country. We would have to ride nearly two hundred miles over
                  rough roads, when it was only fifty to the railroad by the direct route; but that
                  we thought better than waiting a fortnight in so desolate a place as Albany. It
                  would be all of that time before the bridges were repaired, for people in that
                  region are not over 'fast'—in such respects. We started, and riding about six
                  miles, came to a place called Box Ankle—one house, and a cross-road doggery—and
                  the planter there told us that the Kicafoonee, a creek about a mile distant, could
                  be safely swum on the back of a mule, and that he would ferry us over, in that
                  manner for a 'fa'r consideration'. The temptation of swapping two hundred miles
                  for fifty was very great, and we rode down to the stream to reconnoitre. It was
                  fully three hundred yards wide, and the current was running 'like time.' Cabell
                  thought 'the longest way round the shortest way,' to Congress, but I decided to
                  take the direct route and risk the creeks. Agreeing to take charge of my trunk,
                  and to leave it at Savannah, Cabell turned about for the up-country, while I,
                  stripping off my lower garments and tying them to my shoulder, mounted the mule,
                  and breasted the 'swift-flowing flowing waters' of the Kicafoonee. I got safely
                  over, and, walking on about a mile, came upon a planter, who kindly gave me 'a
                  lift' to the Relay Station of the Stage Company. Then I secured a conveyance to
                  the Muckalee, another creek about three miles beyond Starksville. Arriving at the
                  creek, I found it as swollen and furious as the Kicafoonee, and none of the
                  planters in the vicinity willing to risk a mule in an attempt to cross it. I was
                  pondering the adage, 'Make haste slowly,' when the thought of a boat occurred to
                  me.</p>
               <p>"'No one yere' bouts hes one or knows how ter build one,' said the planter to whom
                  I made application.</p>
               <p>"'But, your negro boy here can build a coffin;' (he was just driving the last nail
                  into a monstrous large one) 'if he can do that, he can build a boat. I'll show him
                  how.'</p>
               <p>"'I doan't b'lieve he kin, Stranger; he nuver went more'n a coffin.'</p>
               <p>"'Well, this is mightily like a boat; what will you take for it?'</p>
               <p>"'The old 'ooman orter to be buried ter-day—the fact ar she's bin 'bove ground too
                  long a'ready—but ef ye want it right bad, I reckon ye kin have it fur five
                  dollars.' (It was worth about fifty cents.)</p>
               <p>"'How deep is the stream?'</p>
               <p>"''Bout ten foot, ter the deepest.'</p>
               <p>"'Well, give me some tar and a long pole, and the money is yours.'</p>
               <p>"Calking the coffin with tar and some strips of old bagging, and nailing a cleat
                  across its middle for a seat, I divested myself of my clothing, to be able to swim
                  more freely in case of 'ship-wreck,' and 'launched my bark' on the Muckalee. I got
                     on<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6527-00000061"/> 'swimmingly' till I reached the
                  middle of the creek; then, the current caught the coffin, and carried it at least
                  two miles down the run to where a jutting bank had made a strong eddy in the
                  stream. Floating into this whirlpool, the coffin began sailing round and round,
                  and kept on sailing round and round for a full hour, despite the united efforts of
                  the pole and myself to extricate it. Night was coming on, and staying there after
                  dark was a thing not to be thought of. I was not more than a hundred feet from
                  shore, so I resolved to attempt swimming to it. Strapping my clothes to my
                  shoulder with my suspenders, as I had done when I swam the mule, I lowered myself
                  into the stream, and at the end of half-an-hour, after desperate effort, and once
                  or twice giving myself up for lost, I reached the land."</p>
               <p>"An' whot come on the coffin?" asked Tom.</p>
               <p>"I don't know. It may be there yet."</p>
               <p>"I reckon it ar," he replied, dryly.</p>
               <p>"Then you don't believe the story."</p>
               <p>"Wall, Stranger, I kin gwo it all 'cept the swimmin'. But the man as 'tempts ter
                  swim one o' them runs when they's up, ar uther a rantankerous fool or a—Yankee,
                  an' some reckon one 'bout the same as t' other."</p>
               <p>"Well, Tom, I knew when I was whirling about in that coffin that I wus a
                  rantankerous fool and a Yankee to boot. However, the story is true."</p>
               <p>"And how did Cabell get through?" inquired the parson.</p>
               <p>"After various other mishaps, I reached Oglethorpe at the end of seven days, and
                  found Cabell quietly picking his teeth on the porch of the hotel. He had been
                  there just long enough to eat his dinner; so, you see, 'the longest way round
                     <emph>is</emph> the shortest way to Congress,' after all."</p>
               <p>"'Ludin' ter freshets, stranger," said Tom, "'minds me uv 'un we hed onst in
                  Bladsoe, whar"——</p>
               <p>But the other stories that Tom told, while they might further illustrate the broad
                  native humor of the South, and that spirit of exaggeration which is so important
                  an element in it, and in the Southern character, will keep till the war is over,
                  when you and I, reader, may not feel that we are wasting on idle tales, time and
                  thought that should be given to our country.</p>

               <p>MY pen lingers lovingly over those four companions, around that little pine table,
                  in that quiet camp by the Cumberland. Each is a "character" and a "representative
                  man" in his way and I long to fill out the sketch I have outlined, and to picture,
                  "as large as life and twice as natural," the brave young captain, the type, as he
                  is, of the glorious West; the droll, earnest chaplain, divested of his clerical
                  clothes, and his soul broadened from long contact with the free life of the
                  prairies; the uncouth, fun-loving old negro, who, by the parson's reckoning, is
                  bound, in spite of lying, stealing, and whisky-drinking, to be "in Heaven a
                  thousand years before any white man living;" and the roughhewn, irresistible, and
                  indescribable Tom, with his simple heart, his sturdy sense, his rare truth, and
                  magnificent lying, all of which go to make him the type of the poor white yeomanry
                  of the South—the "mean trash," as the chivalry call them, but no more "trash" than
                  is the oak, which stands strong, rugged, and rough-coated in the forest, waiting
                  to be fashioned into forms of use and beauty.</p>
               <p>What a mass of exaggeration he was! How he magnified every thing, even himself! He
                  could "whip twice his heft in Secesh, bars, or rattlesnakes. With the captain on
                  his back, he could "outrun creation and give it two mile the start." Though not
                  given to drinking, he could tote a "barr'l of whisky," and then pace "a bee line
                  on the brink of a presurpiss." Even when he went afoot, he "piked faster than a
                  horse kintrot," and when he rode, he out-traveled two tornadoes hitched to a
                  jockey-wagon and driven by a darky in livery. He "'lowed" he was ignorant, but he
                  know'd a log from seven dollars and a quarter, and if he seldom thought, when he
                  did think, he went "plumb down lowerin'" the bottom of things, and up to where
                  imagination grows dizzy, and has to steady herself with a gin cocktail. He didn't
                  believe he was "borned fur the stump," but when he got through the "National
                  Speaker"—which the captain had lent him—he know'd he could talk the legs off the
                  parson, though he had hard <emph>him</emph> spout chain-lightning in the breaks of
                  a thunder-storm. He reckoned Heaven was a pretty comfortable sort of a place, but
                  not quite up to some parts of "Bladsoe" County; but "Bladsoe" itself wouldn't be
                  fit for white men to live in if the Union was split to flinders. And if thet
                  happins, stranger, who'll ye git ter make anuther Decel'ration uv Independence?
                  Only two livin' men kin do it—me an' Gin'ral Jackson, an' the Gin'ral's dead, an'
                  me—why I hain't got right well inter the writin' bizness yit."</p>
               <p>"Split the Union," I echoed, "never fear that, Tom; you can't split a rotten
                  log."</p>
               <p>"No more'n ye can't, Stranger," replied Tom, "an' 'tween ye small-soulded,
                  lucre-luvin' Yankees, an' them blue-blasted, nigger-tradin' Secesh, the kentry

               <p>What a picture he would make, drawn with a skilful hand, at full length—"six foot
                  three, without leathers!" Some day my pen may attempt him, but now—I must go on
                  with my yarn.</p>
               <p>On the following morning I rose early to set out for Murfreesboro<pb n="124-125"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000063"/> boro. Arriving at the railway station, I deposited
                  my trunk in the baggage car, and was quietly proceeding to take a seat among the
                  passengers, when a civil young man, in a half-military costume, arrested my steps
                  at the foot of the platform, with: "Please show your pass, Sir."</p>
               <p>I remembered having heard that summons before, and, at once, drew from my pocket a
                  sheet of foolscap ornamented with General Burnside's autograph.</p>
               <p>"This will not do, Sir. We have strict orders to pass no one down without a permit
                  from head-quarters."</p>
               <p>"General Burnside told me this would pass me anywhere in the United States."</p>
               <p>"But you are not in the United States, Sir. Tennessee has joined New Jersey, and
                  gone out of the Union."</p>
               <p>"Well, what shall I do?"</p>
               <p>"Go to General Morgan's headquarters, and ask them to telegraph to Murfreesboro.
                  You'll get a reply in an hour."</p>
               <p>This would detain me at Nashville another day, but there was no help for it, so,
                  reshipping my trunk, I rode back to the hotel. After an hour spent in parleying
                  with General Morgan's aide, another hour in waiting for a reply to the telegram,
                  and still another hour in again dancing attendance on the same aid—a consequential
                  young gentleman, who will probably be a Brigadier by the time his beard begins to
                  grow (Government has made at least a baker's dozen of the same sort), I placed the
                  "opensesame" document in my pocket, and went my way, inwardly resolving never
                  again to set foot in Tennessee till the passport system is abolished.</p>
               <p>The day was on my hands, and, having nowhere else to go, I turned my steps toward
                  the tent of the Illinois chaplain. Passing ing the Governor's house on my way—a
                  large, square, dingy brick building, opposite the Capitol—I left my letters at the
                  door, and walked on to the open fields beyond the town. A half a mile away I came
                  upon the city cemetery, a beautiful spot, with growing grass, and waving trees,
                  and unnumbered flowers growing over low mounds, and in one corner, half a thousand
                  new-made graves with little white headboards, whose simple inscriptions told that
                  the soldiers of the Union were sleeping beneath them.</p>
               <p>One of these graves was open, and an old negro was filling it with earth—singing
                  as he worked. Seating myself on the low paling, I listened to his song. These are
                  some of the words: <q>

               <p>"Lamenting for your master, eh, Uncle?" I said, approaching him. It was wrong in
                  him to turn 'hoss-tief.'"</p>
               <p>The old man paused at his work, and turning on me, with a look of wounded pride,
                  said curtly:</p>
               <p>"<emph>My</emph> massa hain't no hoss-tief, Sar. He neber done no sech t'ing as
                  dat—neber, Sar!"</p>
               <p>"I only took your word for it—that's all," I answered, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Oh, dat warn't <emph>my</emph> massa, Sar," he replied, good naturedly; "dat wus
                  some of dem <emph>low</emph> Secesh. My massa run away, Sar, but he'm a gemmen; he

               <p>"And did you want to go with him?"</p>
               <p>"Oh no, Sar! <emph>I</emph> hain't no secesh; an' I wus fotched up dis away, in
                  Nashville. Massa know'd I didn't want ter leab, an' he reckoned I could shirk fur
                  myseff, somehow, Sar."</p>
               <p>"And how do you get on shirking for yourself?" I asked; "you are very old."</p>
               <p>He seemed at least seventy. His hair was white and his body greatly bowed, and
                  scarcely more than a skeleton.</p>
               <p>"Oh, bery well, Massa, bery well. Union folk bery good ter me, Sar. Eberybody
                  'pear sort o' kin'er ter ole Joe, eber sence de pore boy wus a killed—eber sence
                  he wus a killed, Sar;" and resting on the handle of his spade he brushed away a
                  great tear that was rolling down his cheek.</p>
               <p>"And have you lost a son in the war?"</p>
               <p>"Gran'son, Massa, down ter Stun riber; an' he wus a all I hed, Massa—all I hed,

               <p>"And was he killed in the battle?"</p>
               <p>"No, Sar; dey didn't 'low no brack folks fur sogers den. Dey wouldn't leff him

               <p>"In cold blood! How was it? Tell me."</p>
               <p>To screen myself from the rays of the sun I had taken a seat on a low head-stone,
                  in the shade of a small tree. When I asked this question the old negro, laying
                  aside his spade, squatted on the grass near me, and then in broken sentences, and
                  with frequent interruptions, expressive of the intensity of his feelings, he told
                  me about his grandson.</p>
               <p>"You sees, Massa, his pore mudder—de on'y chile we eber hed—die when Peter was a
                  bery little t'ing, not no higher'n dat grabestone, so he wus a fotched up 'long ob
                  we ole folks, like as ef he wus our own chile. He wus a great comfurt ter us, Sar,
                  an' eberybody tuck ter him, an' eberybody say whot a likely boy Peter wus—he'd a
                  sole ony time fur a tousand dollar, an' in good backer times (he wuck'd in a
                  backer fact'ry) he'd a brung fifteen hun'red, easy, Sar. Wall, when de Secesh make
                  de big skedaddle, massa gwoed long, an he tuck Peter wid him. Dat a'most broked my
                  ole heart, Sar, 'case he wus all I hed—all I hed, Sar; but it wus de Lord's will,
                  an' 'sides it couldn't be holped, nohow. Wall, Peter kept 'long wid de Secesh nigh
                  onter a y'ar, an' den dey want ter make him gunner ter a bat'ry, but Peter tole
                  'em he wouldn't fi't de nordern gemmen, dat am friends ter de brack folks, no
                  way—not fur no 'sid'ration, Sar. Den dey gib him a awfu' whippin', an' lock him up
                  in de jail. He got 'way dough, an' af'er mos' credible suffrin', Sar, de got widin
                  de lines. Dat wus 'bout de time dat Gin'ral Rosey wus a gwine ter smite de
                  Phillistuns wid de hip an' t'igh, down dar ter Stun riber. Wall, dey want Peter
                  ter gwo 'long wid de<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6527-00000065"/> wagins, an' Peter
                  axed me whot he should a do. Now, he wus all I hed, Sar all I hed; an' I sot my
                  bery life on dat boy, but I tole him," and here the old man straightened up his
                  bent form, and his shrunken features assumed a look of quiet dignity. "I tole him,
                  sar, dat he hedn't but one life, an' ter gib dat fur his country, an' de brack
                  folks. An' he done it, Sar! He done it. An' ef dey'd on'y gib'n him a musket,
                  Sar!" (Here, swaying his body to and fro, he burst into a paroxysm of grief,)
                  "on'y gib'n him a musket, Sar, an' leff him fit de Secesh—but, ter die so, Sar—ter
                  die so; it wus too hard—it clean broke ole Joe's heart, Sar."</p>
               <p>"And how <emph>did</emph> he die, Uncle?" I asked when he became somewhat
                  composed.</p>
               <p>"I'll a tell you, Sar. It wus dis a way. Peter, he gwo off wid de wagins, an' I
                  gwo off wid him, 'case, ye sees, I couldn't be ob no use yere, an' dar wus no

                  ter Laverne. He say some one orter gwo up an' leff de cunnel know, but
                     <emph>he</emph> couldn't a gwo, case he went fur Secesh, an' ebery one round

                  be speered but me—ye sees, Peter an' me driv de same wagin, an' hed de same wages;
                  but de leftenan', he sot high on me, an' he gib me my rations, so I tort I could
                  gib my cloes ter de country. We hedn't none but de wagin hosses, but de planter,
                  he say we wus welcome ter his'n; so I got on ter him, an' rid off ter tell Cunnel
                  Innis. (De Lord's hand wus in dat, Sar. Sometimes He cut down de young saplin's
                  an' leab de ole trees a' growin'.) I telled Cunnel Innis whot de planter say, an'
                  de cunnel, dough he hedn't more'n 'bout free hun'red men, 'peared bery glad ter

               <p>Here the old negro paused for a moment. His lips moved silently, but he shed no
                  tears. I said nothing, and he soon resumed his story.</p>
               <p>"I luck'd all 'bout, an' I couldn't fine no sign ob Peter; but arter a while I

                  didn't call it no battle dat day, but dey kep' a firin' de big guns all de time. I

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE REGIMENTAL HOSPITAL.</head>
               <p>LEAVING the old negro at work in the grave-yard, I resumed my way to the tent of
                  the Illinois chaplain. The sun was just sinking behind the trees which skirt the
                  western environs of Nashville when I entered its low doorway.</p>
               <p>"Yere'm de Nordern gemman," exclaimed the sooty representative of the great Roman,
                  as I made my appearance. "I's telled ye, Massa Parson, de Yankees can't do
                  eberyting. Dey can't git fru de red tape dey hab round yere."</p>
               <p>Giving no heed to the negro's remark, the chaplain, who was drawing on his coat as
                  if to go out, welcomed me cordially, and invited me to accompany him to the
                  hospital of the regiment. "One of my boys is dying," he said—"a Tennessee boy,
                  wounded at Stone River. He has lingered till now, but now is going."</p>
               <p>Walking rapidly across the open fields, we entered, at the end of a short
                  half-hour, a dingy warehouse in the very heart of the city. About fifty low cots
                  were ranged along the two sides of a narrow, cheerless apartment on the ground
                  floor of this building, and on one of them the wounded soldier was lying. His face
                  was pallid, his eyes were fixed, a cold, clammy sweat was on his forehead—he was
                  dying. Sitting at his feet was a lad of sixteen; and kneeling at his side, her
                  hand in his, was a middle-aged woman, with worn garments, and a thin,
                  sorrow-marked face.</p>
               <p>"You are too late! He is almost gone," said the colonel of the regiment, as we
                  paused before the group.</p>
               <p>The chaplain made no reply, but slowly uncovered his head, for the dying man was
                  speaking.</p>
               <p>"Mother," he said, "good-by. And you, Tom, good-by. Be of good heart, mother. GOD
                  will take care of you, and save—save the——." A low sound then rattled in his
                  throat, and he passed away, with the name of his country on his lips.</p>
               <p>The mother bent down and closed the eyelids of her dead son; and then, kissing
                  again and again his pale face, turned to go away. As she did so, the chaplain,
                  taking her hand in his, said to her:</p>
               <p>"The LORD gave: the LORD hath taken away."</p>
               <p>Looking up to him with tranquil face and tearless eyes, the woman answered:</p>
               <p>"'Blessed be the name of the Lord.' They have murdered my husband, Mr. Chapl'in,
                  my oldest boy, and now John, too, is gone." Then, laying her hand on the shoulder
                  of her living son, she turned to the colonel, and while her voice trembled a very
                  little, she added: "He's all I've got now, Mr. Cunnel—give him John's place in the
                  rigiment."</p>
               <p>A tear rolled down the colonel's weather-beaten cheek, and he turned his face
                  away, but said nothing. There was a convulsive twitching about the chaplain's
                  firm-set mouth, as <emph>he</emph> said:</p>
               <p>"The Spartan mother gave only <emph>two</emph> sons to her country: would you give
                     <emph>three?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I'd give all—all I've got, Mr. Chapl'in," was the low answer.</p>
               <p>And this was a "poor white" woman! Her words should be heard all over the land.
                  They should go down in history, and make her name—RACHEL SOMERS—immortal.</p>
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6527-00000069"/>
               <p>Passing on to the farther end of the room, the chaplain said to a delicate young
                  girl who was attending the sick:</p>
               <p>"Lucy, are you willing to show your wounds to this gentleman?"</p>
               <p>The young girl blushed, but modestly undoing her dress, showed me the upper part
                  of her back. Deep ridges, striped with red, blue, and white, completely covered
                  it! The slave-driver's whip, with a hundred lashes, had printed our country's
                  colors on her fair skin, because she had refused to betray the hiding-place of her
                  father!</p>
               <p>"I could tell you of hundreds of these people," said the chaplain, as he put his
                  arm within mine, and walked with me towards the hotel, "who have been driven to
                  the woods, hunted with blood-hounds, beaten with stripes, hung to trees, tossed on
                  the points of bayonets, torn asunder with horses, quartered alive, and burned at
                  slow fires, rather than deny their country or betray its friends. The world has
                  seldom seen such patriotism as theirs. There is a grandeur about it which lifts
                  these poor people into heroes, and will make their story the brightest page in the
                  annals of this country."</p>
               <p>The room appropriated to me at the hotel being unfit for the reception of any
                  animal higher in the scale of creation than "four-footed beasts or creeping
                  things," I invited the chaplain, after supper, to a seat on a dilapidated chair in
                  the long, low, smoky apartment which occupies the ground floor of the "Commercial
                  Building," and is dignified with the name of office.</p>
               <p>The chaplain was whiffing slowly away at his cigar, and recounting to me, in his
                  peculiar style, some of his campaign experiences in Dixie—during which he had
                  wielded the sword of Gideon as well as the weapons of the LORD—when the red-faced
                  landlord, with his hat in his hand, and a smirk on his face, approached us,
                  followed by a tall, spare, gentlemanly appearing man, whom he introduced as
                  follows:</p>
               <p>"Mr. ——, this is Secretary East—<emph>our</emph> Secretary—Edward H. East, Esq.
                  You've heered uv him."</p>
               <p>I rose and replied that I had heard of Mr. East, and was very happy to meet him.
                  Returning my greeting, the secretary said:</p>
               <p>"I regret that I was not at home when you left your letters this morning. I am
                  acting in the Governor's absence, and shall be glad to serve you in any way."</p>
               <p>Thanking him, and saying I had already fallen into good hands, I asked the
                  landlord to oblige me with a seat for my visitor. That worthy, who accommodates
                  guests with bed, board, and broken-backed chairs, at the rate of four dollars per
                  diem, looked helplessly around for a moment, and then replied:</p>
               <p>"I don't b'lieve thar's ary other cheer in the hull room."</p>
               <p>"Never mind, never mind," said the secretary, laughing, and drawing a low
                  travelling trunk from a pile in the corner, "this will do."</p>
               <p>The second official of the great State of Tennessee seated himself upon the trunk,
                  and we fell into a long conversation on the condition of the country. In the
                  course of it I said to him:</p>
               <p>"You are a Southern man, sir; tell me, do the Rebel leaders really mean to
                  establish a monarchy?"</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly they do," he replied. "They have had that purpose from the beginning.
                  Their main object in bringing on the war was to get the Southern people into the
                  clutches of a military despotism, so that they might disfranchise them, and thus
                  prevent their ever overturning slavery. If you will come<pb n="138-139"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000070"/> up to the State-House to-morrow, I will show you
                  volumes of correspondence to prove this."</p>
               <p>"But why was it necessary to disfranchise the people? They have followed the lead
                  of the slave-lords blindly. The most of them think slavery promotes their
                  interests."</p>
               <p>"That is true, but Northern ideas were working down among them. In Maryland,
                  Kentucky, Missouri, and Western Virginia, they had spread wonderfully. Those
                  States would have been free long ago if the masses had not thought emancipation
                  would make the blacks the political and social equals of the whites. As soon as
                  they came to be disabused of that notion, they would have voted slavery out of
                  existence; and when they had done that, the people in the Cotton States would have
                  asked the reason why, and then slavery on this continent would have received its
                  everlasting death-blow. Slavery cannot any longer live in the Union. The South can
                  save it only by separation and a despotism."</p>
               <p>After some further conversation we separated, and early the next morning I set out
                  for Murfreesboro.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE MAN WHO "DON'T SURRENDER MUCH."</head>
               <p>THE country below Nashville presented the same desolate appearance as that through
                  which I had already passed. At Lavergne, a whole town lay in ashes. On the direct
                  line of communication with Murfreesboro, it had been the scene of frequent
                  conflicts between the Rebel and the Union forces, and, one after another, its
                  peaceful habitations had fallen before the flames. Its inhabitants had all fled,
                  and two or three smoke-begrimed cabins were all that remained of the once thriving
                  and happy village.</p>
               <p>"I was in the front room of that small house yonder," said Captain Firman, of
                  General Wheeler's staff, to me a few weeks later, as we halted at this station,
                  while he was on his way, a prisoner of war, to the penitentiary at Nashville,
                  "when a shell from one of your batteries entered just beneath the window—you can
                  see the hole from here—and exploded directly at the feet of Wheeler and myself. A
                  lady sat at the piano. The piano was shivered into a thousand fragments, and the
                  lady thrown to the farther end of the room, but not one of us was hurt. The
                  general and I made a hasty exit by the rear door, but our companion, in her
                  fright, ran out at the front. As she came under that old tree standing by the

                  burst over her head, and its fragments fell all around her, but, strange to say,
                  she again escaped uninjured."</p>
               <p>A little elevation at the right of the railway was the scene of one of the most
                  heroic exploits of the war. There Colonel Innis—warned by the old negro I have
                  introduced to the reader—with a little band of three hundred and eighty-nine
                  Michigan men, without artillery or other defence than a hastily thrown up
                  barricade of camp-wagons and underbrush, beat off Wheeler's whole force of three
                  thousand horse and two field-pieces.</p>
               <p>"Colonel Innis," said General Rosecrans to him on the eve of the battle of Stone
                  River, "will you hold Lavergne?"</p>
               <p>"I'll try, general."</p>
               <p>"I ask if you will <emph>do</emph> it!" exclaimed the laconic general.</p>
               <p>"I WILL," quietly responded the colonel, and he kept his word.</p>
               <p>Just as the New Year's sun was sending its first greeting to the little band that
                  crouched there behind the wagons, the head of the Rebel column emerged from the
                  woods which skirt the southern side of the town, and Captain Firman, riding
                  forward to the flimsy breast-work, cried out:</p>
               <p>"General Wheeler demands an instant and unconditional surrender."</p>
               <p>"Give General Wheeler my compliments, and tell him we don't surrender much," came
                  back to him from behind the brush-heaps.</p>
               <p>Mounting then his Kentucky roan, the heroic colonel rode slowly around the rude
                  intrenchment. "Boys," he said, "they are three thousand—have you said your
                  prayers?"</p>
               <p>"We are ready, Colonel. Let them come on!" answered the brave Michigan men.</p>
               <p>And they did come on!</p>
               <p>"Six times we swept down on them," said Captain Firman to me, "and six times I
                  rode up with a flag, and summoned them to surrender; but each time Innis sent back
                  the message, varied, now and then, with an adjective, 'We don't surrender much.'
                  He sat his horse during the first charges, as if on dress parade; but at the third
                  fire I saw him go down. I thought we had winged him, but when we charged again,
                  there he sat as cool as if the thermometer had been at zero. One of our men took
                  deliberate aim, and again he went down; but when I rode up the fifth time and
                  shouted, 'We'll not summon you again—surrender at once!' it was Innis who yelled
                  out, 'Pray don't, for <emph>we don't surrender much.</emph>' At the seventh charge
                  I was wounded, and the general sent another officer with the summons. Your people
                  halted him a few hundred yards from the breast-work, and an officer, in a
                  cavalryman's overcoat, came out to meet him. ['They had killed my two horses,'
                  said Colonel Innis to me afterwards, 'and I was afraid they would singe my
                  uniform—the fire was <emph>rather</emph> hot—so I covered it.']</p>
               <p>"'What is your rank, sir?' demanded the Union officer.</p>
               <p>"'Major, sir.'</p>
               <p>"'Go back, and tell General Wheeler that he insults me by sending one of your rank
                  to treat with one of mine. Tell him, too, I have not come here to surrender. I
                  shall fire on the next flag.'</p>
               <p>"It was Innis, and by that ruse he made us believe he had received
                  re-enforcements. Thinking it was so, we drew off, and the next day Innis sent
                  Wheeler word by a prisoner, that he had whipped us with three hundred and
                  eighty-nine men!"</p>
               <p>About a fortnight after my arrival at Murfreesboro, as I sat one morning reading a
                  newspaper in the "Aides' Room" at headquarters<pb n="142-143"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000072"/> quarters, a tall, erect, sinewy-built,
                  noble-featured man, with dark flowing hair, a long, elastic stride, and a
                  monstrous steel-hilted sword dangling at his heels, and clanking heavily on the
                  floor at his every step, stalked into the room, and, giving me a casual glance,
                  entered General Garfield's apartment. In a moment he returned, and, striding
                  directly up to me, said:</p>
               <p>"Sir, are you the man who wrote 'Among the Pines?'"</p>
               <p>There was something in his quick, abrupt voice and decided, energetic manner, that
                  made me uncertain of his intentions: so, rising from my seat, and drawing myself
                  up to my full height, I replied, in a half-defiant tone:</p>
               <p>"I am, sir: at your service."</p>
               <p>"I want to take you by the hand, sir. God bless you!" was the hearty response.</p>
               <p>Considerably relieved, I said, as I accepted his greeting:</p>
               <p>"And <emph>you</emph> are——?"</p>
               <p>"Colonel Innis—Innis of the Michigan Engineers."</p>
               <p>"Oh! You are the man, who '<emph>don't surrender much!</emph>'"</p>
               <p>"Not much—that is, I never did."</p>
               <p>Saying I would like to know him better, I asked him to be seated. He sat down, and
                  fought the battle over again. When he had concluded, I said:</p>
               <p>"I met an old negro at Nashville, who told me he rode up from Murfreesboro and
                  warned you of Wheeler's coming. He said you made him stay over night, and treated
                  him like a white man."</p>
               <p>"I tried to, for he saved me from a surprise. Wheeler captured all of my pickets
                  before sunrise, and without the old darkey's warning, I mightn't have been half
                  ready. There is nothing Wheeler would like so well as to take me. We have had
                  several fights, and after each one I have sent him word how many men it took to
                  whip him."</p>
               <p>In a western city, a few weeks ago, I met the colonel again. Laying my hand on his
                  shoulder, I accosted him with—</p>
               <p>"And you've not surrendered yet!"</p>
               <p>"Not yet," he replied, turning round and taking my hand; "but I've had another
                  brush with Wheeler. Just after Chicamauga he came upon me with nearly five
                  thousand men. I beat him off, and then sent him word I had whipped him with
                  one-half of my regiment."</p>
               <p>The West has sent many brave men to the war, but none braver than INNIS.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <head type="sub">BIBLE SMITH.</head>
               <p>AS I alighted from the cars at Murfreesboro, the inevitable official again
                  confronted me.</p>
               <p>"Can I get a conveyance to Head-quarters?" I asked him.</p>
               <p>"Yes, there's an omnibus here. But the General's not in town. He's at the
                  front."</p>
               <p>"And where can I find lodgings for a few days?"</p>
               <p>"Don't know. There's not a hotel or lodging-house in the place."</p>
               <p>A town of eight thousand people with not a single inn! Surely this was the miracle
                  of the nineteenth century.</p>
               <p>After a short search I found the omnibus—a cast-off Northern coach, with a Yankee
                  Jehu.</p>
               <p>"My friend," I said to him, "will you take me where I can sleep to-night?"</p>
               <p>"Yes: I'll take you to jail. It's the only house here that takes in
                  strangers."</p>
               <p>I was about asking him to drive me to Head-quarters, in the hope that my letters,
                  even in the General's absence, might secure me a night's lodging, when a heavy
                  hand was laid on my shoulder, and a strangely familiar voice—a face we may forget,
                  but a voice that has once given us pleasure, lingers in the memory
                  forever—accosted me, as follows:</p>
               <p>"I know'd it wus ye. I know'd ye the minnit I sot eyes on ye."</p>
               <p>Turning on the speaker, I saw a spare, squarely-built, loose-jointed man, above
                  six feet high, with a strongly marked face, a long, grizzly beard, and silvery
                  black hair hanging loosely over his shoulders like a woman's. He wore an officer's
                  undress coat, and the boots of the cavalry service, but the rest of his costume
                  was of the common "butternut" homespun. Taking his extended hand, and trying hard
                  to recall his features, I said to him:</p>
               <p>"I know your voice, but your face I don't remember."</p>
               <p>"Doan't remember me! me, Bible—Bible Smith! Why I'd a know'd <emph>ye</emph> ef
                  yer face hed been blacker'n yer Whig principles."</p>
               <p>We had not met in many years, but the name brought him to my remembrance. Again
                  grasping his hand, and shaking it, this time, with a right good will, I
                  exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"I'm delighted to see you, Bible; and to see you <emph>here</emph>—true to the old
                  flag."</p>
               <p>"Ye mought hev know'd thet. I know'd <emph>ye</emph> war right, ef ye war a Whig.
                  But ye wants ter git under kiver. I knows a old 'ooman yere—she's secesh way up
                  ter the yeres, an' her fixins hain't nothin' loike whot ye gits in York, but I
                  reckon ef I ax her, she'll take ye in."</p>
               <p>"Any place will do till the General returns—I have letters to him."</p>
               <p>The omnibus man went in quest of my trunk, and in a short time, accompanied by my
                  new-found friend, I was on my way to the house of the Secession lady. Before going
                  thither I will make the reader somewhat acquainted with my companion, in the hope
                  that what I shall say of him may lead the public<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000074"/> to think better of the whole edition of Southern
                  "Bibles," who, though badly "bound," and sadly deficient in the way of "lettering"
                  and "embellishment," have about as much homely truth and genuine worth as the more
                  gilded things found in higher latitudes.</p>
               <p>Late in November, 1850, as I was journeying on horseback from Tuscaloosa, Alabama,
                  to Louisville, Kentucky, I was overtaken by a storm, just at night-fall, and
                  forced to ask shelter at a small farm-house near the little town of Richmond, in
                  Bedford County, Tennessee. The house stood in a small clearing, a short distance
                  from the highway, and was one story high, of hewn logs nicely chinked and
                  whitewashed, with a projecting roof, a broad, open piazza, and an enormous brick
                  chimney-stack protruding at either gable. As I rode up to it, the farmer came out
                  to meet me. He was dressed in homespun, and had a wiry, athletic frame, a dark,
                  sun-browned complexion, an open, manly face, and a frank, cordial manner that won
                  my confidence in a moment. With thirteen years less of life and a century less of
                  hardship, he was the same man who met me at the Murfreesboro railway station. He
                  bade me "good evenin'" as I approached him, and returning his salutation, I asked
                  him for shelter for myself and horse.</p>
               <p>"Sartin, Stranger," he replied; "I nuver turned away one o' God's images yit, ef
                  they wus a Yankee—an' some o' them is drefful pore likenesses, ye mought bet a
                  pile on thet."</p>
               <p>"Why do you think I am a Yankee?" I asked, smiling.</p>
               <p>"I sees it all over ye. But, come, alight; ye's welcome ter all I hes, an' ef ye
                  kin spin a yarn, or tell a lie, ony bigger'n I kin, I'll 'low a Yankee ar
                  smarter'n a Tennesseean—an' I nuver know'd one as war yit."</p>
               <p>Dismounting, I requested him to give my horse some oats, remarking that I made
                  free with him, because I expected to pay for what I had.</p>
               <p>"Pay!" he exclaimed; "Nuver ye tork uv pay, Stranger, 'tween two sich men as ye
                  an' me is, or ye'll make me fight another duel. It's agin my principles, but I fit
                  one onst, an' it mought be <emph>ye</emph> wouldn't loike ter hev me fit
                  another."</p>
               <p>"Not with me, I assure you. I'd take free quarters with you for a month rather
                  than fight a duel."</p>
               <p>"Yer a sensible man; fur I shud, fur shore, sarve ye jest as I done Clingman—thet
                  famous North Car'lina chap. P'raps ye nuver yered how I fit him?"</p>
               <p>"No, I never did," I replied.</p>
               <p>"Wall, I'll tell ye on it. But yere, Jake" (to a stout, cheerful negro, who just
                  then appeared at the corner of the house), "Yere, Jake, tuck the gen'leman's nag,
                  rub him down, an' guv him some oats, an' mind, doan't ye guv no parson's measure
                  wuth the oats."</p>
               <p>"Nuver you f'ar, Massa. Jake'll gub it ter 'im chock-heapin'—loike you gub's
                  eberyting, Massa," rejoined the negro, bounding nimbly into the saddle, and riding
                  off to the barnyard.</p>
               <p>The farmer then turned and led the way into the house. At the door of the
                  sitting-room we were met by his wife—a comely, dark-eyed woman of about thirty,
                  neatly clad in a calico gown, with shoes and stockings (a rarity in that region)
                  on her feet, and a spotless lace cap perching cosily on the back of her head.</p>
               <p>"Sally," said my host, as we entered the room, "yere'r a stranger, so, tuck him
                  in; guv him fritters an' apple-jack fur<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6527-00000075"/>
                  supper, fur he'm a Yankee, an' thar's no tellin' but ye mought save the kentry ef
                  ye made him fall in love wuth ye."</p>
               <p>The good woman laughed, gave me a cordial greeting, asked me to a seat by the
                  fire, and went about preparing supper. As I seated myself with her husband, by the
                  broad hearth-stone, I glanced around the apartment. It occupied one-half of the
                  building, and had a most cosey and comfortable appearance. On the floor was a tidy
                  rag carpet, and the plastered walls were covered with a modest paper, and
                  ornamented with a half dozen neatly-framed engravings. A gilded looking-glass,
                  festooned with sprigs of evergreen, hung between the front windows, and opposite
                  to it stood a huge piece of mahogany, half a side-board, half a bureau, which in
                  its day had graced some statelier mansion. A dozen rustic arm-chairs, covered with
                  untanned deerskin, a small stand in the corner, piled high with such books as the
                  Bible, The "Pilgrim's Progress," and "Doddridge's Expositor," and a large pine
                  table, on which my hostess was arranging the tea-things, completed the furniture
                  of the room. A little boy of five and a little girl of seven were helping the good
                  wife set the tea-table, and through an open door at the rear, I saw an older
                  child, with her mother's dark-brown hair and her father's expressive features,
                  busily frying the fritters over the kitchen fire.</p>
               <p>After asking me where I "come from," where I "mought be a moseyin' ter," and other
                  similar questions, my host said:</p>
               <p>"So, ye nuver yered how I fit Clingman—thet big Whig chap over thar ter North
                  Car'lina?"</p>
               <p>"No," I replied, "I never did, but I would like to, for I know Clingman, and am a
                  Whig myself."</p>
               <p>"Ye is! Wall, I'd nuver a thort it ter luck at ye; an' it do 'pear sort o' quar
                  ter me thet ony <emph>white</emph> man kin go agin free schools, free speech, free
                  thort, and free a'r fur all o' God's critters, but <emph>ye</emph> does, ef ye's a
                  Whig, or I hain't read the dictionary!"</p>
               <p>"What dictionary have you read that in?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"Wall, ter tell ye the truth, Stranger—an' thet, though it'r gittin' out o'
                  fashion, ar what we orter do—<emph>I</emph> nuver read it in nary one: Sally, ye
                  sees, do all the readin' uv the <unclear>fambly</unclear>. But, I allers reckoned
                  them wus whig principles."</p>
               <p>"And what are democratic principles?"</p>
               <p>"Jest the contrary. Thet's whot dimmocrat means. Whig ar only another name fur
                  big; an' it means big-bugs, fur all o' them goes thet way. But they karn't hev my
                  vote, no-how. I goes fur the Decleration uv Independence—life, liberty, an' the
                  pursoot uv whot ye loikes. I'se got it—hangin' up thar agin the wall. The man as
                  writ thet war some punkins."</p>

               <p>"Wall, ye sees, it war jest afore the last 'lection, when ye put in ole Zack fur
                  President. The Whigs they had a big barbacue down ter Richmond, an' Clingman an' a
                  hull lot uv 'em went inter speechifying ter kill. Wall, in the coorse uv
                  Clingman's speech he said thet Cass, our canderdate, wus a nigger-trader down that
                  ter Newbern way, an' wus in jail fur passin' counterfit money, an' ef we 'lected
                  him, we'd hev ter bail him out ter 'naugerate him. Now, I couldn't stand thet, no

                  stopped short ter onst, an' axed me fur my redress."</p>

               <p>"<emph>Address,</emph>" said his wife, pausing in her work, and looking pleasantly
                  at me.</p>
               <p>"Thet's so, Sally," replied the farmer. "I telled ye, Stranger, Sally hes all the
                  larnin' uv the fambly. She's a quality 'ooman—she is! Wall, I guv Clingman my

                  wuth a challunge, all writ out in Clingman's own hand—an' ye knows he's a right

                  read the thing—I hain't got no furder nur prent yit—so I guv it ter Sally. Sally
                  she screeched out when she seed whot it war 'bout, but I telled har ter stand up,
                  an' die loike a man, an' so—she sot down, an' 'cepted the challunge. Now, ye
                  knows, the challunged 'un allers hes the chise o' weapons, so I said I'd hev
                  swords, mounted."</p>
               <p>"Then you are familiar with sword practice?" I remarked.</p>
               <p>"Furmilye wuth it! I nuver seed more'n one sword, in all my borned days, an' thet
                  war so durned rusty a ox-team couldn't dror it. It hung over dad's front door when
                  I war a young 'un. Dad said he fit wuth it ter Cowpens, but I know'd he didn't,
                  'case he couldn't ha' been more'n two y'ar old at thet writin', an' he allers hed
                  a awful way o' lyin'.</p>
               <p>"Wall, I said swords, mounted, at sun-up the next mornin', over agin my r'ar
                  pinery. Now, I hes a drefful smart ox-brute thet I'se a raised up fur my privat'
                  ridin'—ye knows, we uses them critters jest as ye does hosses. The brute he doan't
                  loike a spur, an' when ye puts one inter 'im, he'll pitch, head-fore-mose, inter
                  the fust thing he comes ter, be it man or beast. Wall, in the mornin' I tuck out
                  the cow-horn (ye'd think Gabriel war a soundin' the last trump when I blows it),
                  cut a right smart stick fur a sword, put it inter a yaller bag thet lucked loike a

                  coat, but red an' yaller dominates. Wall, I put on the kiverlet fur a saddle, an'
                  moseyed off ter the dueling ground.</p>
               <p>"Clingman, he war thar, wuth two seconds, a doctor, an' a hull 'pothecary store uv

                  the terms uv the duel—swords, mounted—an' I telled him ef he didn't stand, an'
                  fight loike a man, I'd post him all over the State o' North Car'lina fur a coward.
                  Wall, finarly he 'cluded ter do it. So, we tuck our stands, the seconds they guv

                  my appreciation of the farmer's story, his comely wife said to me:</p>
               <p>"Fotch up yer cheer, Stranger. We hain't nothin' 'cept common doin's, but we's

                  corn-pone, fritters, tea, cider, and apple-jack, all heaped upon it in promiscuous
                  confusion. I had ridden far, and eaten nothing since the morning, but I might have
                  relished the viands had my appetite been much daintier than it was.</p>
               <p>A desultory conversation followed till the close of the meal. When it was over,
                  again seating myself with the farmer before the blazing light-wood fire, while his
                  wife and elder daughter went about clearing away the tea-things, I said to
                  him:</p>
               <p>"You guessed rightly, my friend. I <emph>am</emph> a Yankee, and I have the Yankee
                  way of asking questions. Now, I want to ask you how you live, what you raise, how
                  many negroes you have—all about yourself, for I've already fallen in love with you
                  and—your wife."</p>
               <p>"Fall'n in love wuth <emph>me!</emph> ha! ha!" echoed the farmer. "Stranger,

               <p>"Uvery thing—she an' the little gal. She woan't hev no lazy nigger wimmin round.

               <p>"Nearly all do—except my wife. <emph>She</emph> don't, because I have none. But I
                  intend to have one. I shall probably wait till your husband breaks his neck, and

               <p>"The heart, not the wealth or the intellect, Madam, makes the true aristocracy," I
                  replied, gravely.</p>
               <p>"Thet's whot our parson sez; an' in heaven, he sez, them as gits the highest hes

               <p>"Doan't ye say thet, Sally," said the farmer, looking at his wife, with a tender
                  light in his eyes, and a beautiful smile on his rough features: "The LORD

               <p>"Yas, He ar, fur He knows ye jest loike I does."</p>
               <p>The farmer made no reply, and a short silence followed. I broke it by saying:</p>

                  Sally, he sez ter me, sez he: 'Thar, Bible, thar's my last wull an' testamunt—tuck

                  nig ar allers right—he's got a head longer'n the moral law—so, I saddled the mar,
                  an' sallied out arter Sally.</p>
               <p>"I hed ter scour nigh 'bout all o' creation, an' it tuck me four hull months ter
                  do it, but—I found har. Soon as I sot eyes on har I know'd it war she, an' I
                  telled har so, but she say: 'Ye must ax Par.' (Sally hes book-breedin', ye sees,
                  so she sez <emph>par</emph> instead o' <emph>dad,</emph> which ar' the nat'ral
                  way.) Wall, I axed 'par'—he's one on yer quality folk, been ter Congress, an' only

                  agin the weddin'. I know'd he'd come round, an' he done it. So I sez ter Sally:
                  'Sally,' sez I: 'we'll be morried ter-morrer.'</p>

               <p>"'Cloes!' sez I; 'nuver mind yer cloes—I doan't morry ye fur them.'</p>
               <p>"So Sally she consented, an' I piked out fur a parson. Now, thar warn't none

                  toted off all the bridges, so when the parson an' me got down ter the run jest
                  arter noon the next day—we wus ter a been morried at levin'—thar warn't no way o'
                  crossin', but—thar war Sally, on the t'other side uv the run, in har sun-bunnet
                  an' a big umbrell', onpatiently waitin' fur us. Thar warn't no other how, so I sez
                  ter the parson: 'Parson,' sez I: 'say over the Prayer-Book—Sally's got the hull uv
                  it by heart agin this time—we'll be morried ter onst, right yere.' So, the parson
                  he said over the Prayer-Book, Sally she made the 'sponses—all 'bout the 'beyin'
                  an' so on—an' we's been man an' wife uver sense; an' Stranger, I doan't keer whar

               <p>"An' does ye b'lieve thet story, Stranger?" asked Sally, who, having finished
                  clearing away the tea-things, had, with the older daughter, and the younger
                  children, taken a seat near me in the chimney-corner.</p>

               <p>"I can't say that I do. Not altogether," I replied.</p>
               <p>"I'm glad on it, fur we wus morried in a house, loike Christun people—we wus."</p>
               <p>"Is Jake your only slave?" I asked the farmer after a while.</p>
               <p>"Yas, he'r my only 'un, but he's as good as ony two ye uver know'd on. Ye sees, I
                  raises nigh on ter no craps 'cept mulebrutes an' horned critters, an' them, ye
                  knows, browse in the woods, an' doan't make much wuck."</p>
               <p>If this chapter were not already too long I would tell the reader more of this
                  farmer's family; how every thing about the house and out-buildings was the model
                  of neatness; how the comely housewife strove, with grace and cheerfulness, to do
                  honor to a stranger guest; how tidily she kept her handsome brood, all clad in
                  homespun of her own weaving, and her own making; how the younger children climbed
                  their father's knee, pulled his beard, and laughed at his stories, as if they had
                  never heard them before; how nimbly the elder daughter sprang to do her mother's
                  bidding, how she fetched the apples from the loft, and the apple-<emph>jack</emph>
                  from the pantry, and, between times, helped to lull the sleepy little ones to
                  sleep, or to keep them, wakeful, out of mischief; how when we parted for the
                  night, Sally read a chapter from the big Bible, and then, all kneeling down, made
                  such a prayer as the GOOD ALL FATHER loves to hear; how when I bade them
                  "good-bye" in the morning, all had to kiss me, from the mother to the youngest;
                  and how Bible, giving me a parting grasp of the hand, said as I mounted to ride
                  away:</p>
               <p>"Come out an' settle yere, Stranger; we'll send ye ter Congress—the man as hes
                  cheek enuff ter kiss a man's wife afore his vury face, kin git ony office in this
                  part o' the kentry!"</p>
               <p>Of all this and more, I would like to tell, but have I not already said enough to
                  show that true worth and real manliness exist among the "poor whites" of the
                  South? Though ignorant and illiterate, uncouth of speech, and ungainly of manner,
                  have not those who so well observe the obligations of husband and father, mother
                  and wife and daughter, learned some of the higher duties of life?</p>

               <p>SEATED after dinner on the piazza of the hospitable Southern lady, Bible told me
                  his story.</p>
               <p>He had been stripped of all his property, his wife and children had been driven
                  from their home, his house had been burned to the ground, and he himself hunted
                  through the woods like a wild beast, because he had remained true to what he
                  called democratic principles—"free schools, free speech, free thought and free a'r
                  fur all o' GOD'S critters."</p>
               <p>The world went well with him till the breaking out of the Rebellion. That event
                  found him the owner of fifteen likely negroes, a fine plantation of nine hundred
                  and thirty acres, and a comfortable framed dwelling and out-buildings. His elder
                  daughter had married a young farmer of the district, and his younger—little Sally,
                  whom I remembered as a rosy-cheeked, meek-eyed wee thing of only seven years—had
                  grown up a woman.</p>
               <p>In the spring of 1861, when there were no Union troops south of the Ohio, and the
                  secession fever was raging furiously all over his county, he organized one hundred
                  and six of his neighbors into a company of Home Guards, and was elected their
                  captain. They were pledged to resist all attacks on the person or property of any
                  of their number, and met frequently in the woods in the vicinity of their homes.
                  This organization secured Bible safety and free expression of opinion till long
                  after Tennessee went out of the Union. In fact, he felt so secure that, in 1862—a
                  year after the State seceded—nnder the protection of his band of Home Guards, he
                  inaugurated and carried through a celebration of the fourth of July at Richmond,
                  Tennessee, under the very guns of a rebel regiment then forming in the town.</p>
               <p>An act of so much temerity naturally attracted the attention of the Confederate
                  authorities, and not long afterwards he was roused from his bed one morning before
                  day-break, by three hundred armed men, who told him that he was a prisoner, and
                  that all his property was confiscated to the Government. They at once enforced the
                  "confiscation act;" "and this," he said, taking from his wallet a piece of soiled
                  paper, "ar' whot I hed ter 'tribute ter the dingnation consarn. It'r Sally's own
                  handwrite, an' I knows ye loikes har, so, ye kin hev it, fur it'll nuver be uv no
                  manner uv account ter me."</p>
               <p>The schedule is now before me, and I copy it <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >verbatim:</foreign> "14 men and wimmin" (Jake eluded the soldiers and escaped
                  to the woods), "1600 barrils corn, 130 sheeps, 700 bushls wheat, 440 barley, 100
                  rye, 27 mules, 5 cow-brutes, 105 head hogs, 17 horses and mars, and all they cud

               <p>"Wall, they tied me, hand an' fut," he continued; "an' toted me off ter the
                  Military Commission sittin' ter Chattanooga. I know'd whot thet meant—a short
                  prayer, a long rope, an' a break-down danced on the top o' nothin'. Better men nur

                  goin' afore uv Sally. Ye sees, I hedn't been nigh so good a man as I'd orter be,
                  an' I reckoned Sally—who, ye knows, ar the best 'ooman thet uver<pb n="160-161"

                  His eyes ter a heap o' my doin's; an' sides, I should, I know'd, feel a mighty
                  strange loike up thar without har. Wall, I detarmined not ter go, so thet night,
                  as we war camped out on the ground, I slid the coil, stole a nag, an' moseyed off.
                  Howsumuver, I hedn't got more'n a hun'red rods, 'fore the durned Secesh yered me,
                  an' the bullets fell round me thicker'n tar in January. They hit the hoss, winged
                  me a trifle, an' in less nur ten minnits, hed me tighter'n uver. They swore a
                  streak uv blue brimstun', an' said they'd string me up ter onst, but I telled 'em
                  they wouldn't, 'case I know'd I war a gwine ter live ter holp do thet ar' same
                  turn fur Jeff. Davis. Wall, I s'pose my impudence hed suthin' ter do wuth it, fur
                  they didn't hang me—ye mought know thet, Mr. ——, fur, ye sees, I hes a good neck
                  fur stretchin' yit."</p>
               <p>"Wall we got ter Chattanooga jest arter noon. The Commission they hed too many on
                  hand thet day ter 'tend ter my case, an' the jail wus chock-heapin', so they put
                  me inter a tent under guard uv a hull Georgy regiment. Things luck'd 'mazin'
                  squally, an' much as I detarmined ter be a man, my heart went clean down inter my
                  boots whenuver I thort uv Sally. I nuver felt so, afore or sence, fur then I
                  hedn't got used ter luckin' at the gallus uvery day.</p>
               <p>"Wall, <emph>I</emph> didn't know whot ter do, but thinkin' the Lord did, I
                  kneeled down an' prayed right smart. I telled Him I hedn't no face ter meet Him
                  afore I'd a done suthin' fur the kentry, an' thet Sally's heart would be clean
                  broke ef I went afore har, but, howsumuver, I said, He know'd best, an' ef it war
                  His will, I hed jest nothin' ter say agin it. Thet's all I said, but I said, but I
                  said it over an' over, a heap o' times, an it war right dark when I got off uv my
                  knees. The Lord yered me, thet's sartin, 'case I hedn't mere'n got up fore a dirty
                  grey-back; drunker'n a member uv Congress, staggered inter the tent. I reckon he
                  thort he war ter home, fur he drapped down onter the ground an' went ter sleep,
                  wuthout so much as axin' ef I wus willin'.</p>
               <p>"Then it come inter my head, all ter onst, whot ter do. Ye sees, the critters hed
                  tied me hand an' fut, an' teddered me wuth a coil ter one o' the tent-stakes, so I
                  couldn't move only jest so fur; but the Lord He made the drunken feller lop down
                  jest inside uv reachin'. Wall, when I war shore he war dead asleep, I rolled over
                  thar, drawed out the Bowie-knife in his belt wuth my teeth, an' sawed off my
                  wristlets in no time. Ye kin reckon it didn't take long ter undo the 'tother
                  coils, an' ter 'propriate his weapons, tie 'im hand an' fut loike I war, strip off
                  his coat, put mine onter 'im, swap hats, an' pull the one I guv him down onter his
                  eyes loike as ef he nuver wanted ter see the sun agin. When I'd a done thet, I
                  stopped ter breathe, an' luckin' up I seed a light a comin'. I 'spicioned it war
                  ter 'xamine arter me, so I slunk down inter a corner o' the tent, jest aside the
                  door. They wus a leftenant, an' three privits, makin' the rounds, an' the light
                  showed me nigh onter a army uv sentinels all about thar. Thet warn't no way
                  encouragin', but sez I ter myself: 'Bible,' sez I, 'be cool an' outdacious, an'
                  'ye'll git out o' this, yit;' so, when the leftenant luck'd in, an' sayin': 'All
                  right,' put out agin, I riz up, an' jined the fellers as wus a follerin' on him. I
                  kept in the shadder, an' they, s'posin' I war one on 'em, tuck no kind uv notice
                  uv me. We'd luck'd arter three or four pore prisoners loike I war, when I thort
                  I'd better be a moseyin', so I drapped ahind<pb n="162-163"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000082"/> an' arter a while dodged out beyont the second line
                  o' pickets. I'd got nigh onter a patch uv woods half a mile off, when all ter onst
                  a feller sprung up frum a clump uv bushes, yelled, 'Halt,' an' pinted his musket
                  stret at me. I mought hev eended 'im, but I reckoned others wus nigh, an' sides, I
                  nuver takes humin life ef I kin holp it; so I sez ter 'im: 'Why, Lord bless me,
                  cumrad', I didn't seed ye.' 'I s'pose ye didn't. Whot is ye doin' yere?' sez he.
                  'Only pursuin' a jug o' blue ruin I'se out thar hid under a log,' sez I. 'Ye knows
                  it'r agin rule ter tote it inside, but a feller must licker.' 'Wall, licker up
                  ter-morrer,' sez he. 'We's got 'ticklar orders ter let no 'un out ter-night.'
                  'Blast the orders,' sez I. 'Ye'd loike a swig yerself.' 'Wall, I would,' sez he.
                  'Wull ye go snacks?' 'Yas,' sez I; 'an' guv ye chock-heapin' measure, fur I
                     <emph>must</emph> hev some o' thet afore mornin'.'</p>
               <p>"Thet brung him, an' I piked off for the ruin. (It warn't thar, ye knows—I nuver
                  totch the dingnation stuff.) Ye'd better b'lieve the grass didn't grow under my
                  feet when onst I got inter the woods. I plumbed my coorse by the stars, an' made
                  ten right smart miles in no time. Then it come inter my head thet I'd a forgot all
                  about the Lord, so I kneeled down right thar, an' thanked Him. I telled Him I seed
                  His hand jest so plain as ef it war day-time, an' thet, as shore as my name war
                  Bible, I'd foller His lead in futur'—an' I'se tried ter, uver sense.</p>
               <p>"I'd got ter be right wall tuckered out by thet time—the 'citement, ye see, hed
                  holt me up, but I'd no sooner gone ter prayin' 'fore my knees guv out all ter
                  onst—so, I put fur a piece uv timber, lay down under a tree, an' went ter sleep. I
                  must hev slept mighty sound, fur, long 'bout mornin', some'un hed ter shuck me
                  awful hard, an' turn me clar over, 'fore it woked me. I got up. 'Twar nigh so
                  light as day, though 'twarn't sun-up. Yit I luck'd all round, an' didn't see a
                  soul! Now, whot d'ye s'pose it war thet woked me?"</p>
               <p>"Your own imagination, I reckon. You were dreaming, and in your dream you thought
                  some one shook you," I replied.</p>
               <p>"No; 'twarn't thet. I nuver dreams. It war the LORD! An' He done it 'case I'd
                  prayed ter 'im. I'se nuver gone ter sleep, or woke up, sense, wuthout prayin' ter
                  HIM, an' though I'se been in a heap uv wuss fixes nur thet, He's got me out uv all
                  on 'em, jest 'case I does pray ter Him."</p>
               <p>I did not dispute him. Who that reads the New Testament as Bible reads it—like a
                  little child—<emph>can</emph> dispute him. In a moment he went on with his
                  story.</p>
               <p>"Wall, I luck'd all round, an' seed nuthin', but I <emph>yered</emph>—not a mile
                  off—the hounds a bayin' away loike a young thundergust. They wus arter me, an'
                  thet wus the why the GOOD LORD woked me. I luck'd at the 'volver I'd stole from
                  the sodger, seed it war all right, an' then clumb a tree. 'Bout so quick as it
                  takes ter tell it, the hounds—two 'mazin' fine critters, wuth a hun'red an' fifty
                  apiece—wus on me. I run my eye 'long the pistol-barr'l, an' let drive. It tuck
                  jest two shots ter kill 'em. I know'd the Secesh wus a follerin' the dogs, so,
                  ye'd better b'lieve I made purty tall racin' time till I got ter the eend uv the
                  timber.</p>
               <p>"Jest at night I run agin some darkies, who guv me suthin ter eat, an' nothin'
                  more happin'd 'fore the next night, when I come in sight o' home. I got ter the
                  edge uv the woods, on the hill jest ahind uv my barn, 'bout a hour by sun; but I

               <p>Here the rough, strong man bent down his head and wept again. The moisture filled
                  my own eyes as he continued:</p>
               <p>"She telled the Lord how much I war ter har; how she'd a loved me uver sense she'd

                  me; how she'd tried ter make me love Him; how she know'd thet, way down in my
                  heart, I did love Him, though I didn't say so, 'case men doan't speak out 'bout
                  sech things loike wimmin does. An' she telled Him how she hed tried ter do His
                  will; tried ter be one on His raal chillen; an' she telled Him He hed promised not

                  war best; thet she could see me die, an' not weep a tear, ef I could only die
                  loike a man, wuth a musket in my hand, a doin' suthin' for my kentry. Then she
                  prayed Him ter send me back ter har fur jest one day, so she mought ax me once
                  more ter love Him—an' she know'd I would love Him ef she axed me agin—an' she said
                  ef He'd only do thet, she'd—much as she loved me—she'd send me away, an' guv me
                  all up ter Him an' the kentry fur uver!</p>
               <p>"I couldn't stand no more, so, I opened the door, drapped onter my knees, tuck har
                  inter my arms, lay my head on har shoulder, an' sobbed out: 'The Lord hes yered

                  Sally!'"</p>
               <p>He paused for a moment, and covered his face with his hands. When he spoke again
                  there was a softness and tenderness in his tone that I never heard in the voice of
                  but one other man.</p>
               <p>"Sense thet minnit this yerth hes been another yerth ter me; an' though I'se lost

               <p>"Wall, they begun ter parley. 'We doan't want ter shed no blood,' said the
                  leftenant: 'but we's orders ter take ye, Mister Smith, an' ye'd better go wuth us,
                  peaceable loike.'</p>
               <p>"'I shan't go wuth ye peaceable loike, nur no other how,' sez I; 'fur ye's a pack
                  o' howlin' thieves an' traitors as no decent man 'ud be seed in company uv. Ye
                  disgraces the green yerth ye walks on, an' ef ye doan't git off uv my sheer uv it,
                  in less nur no time, I'll send ye—though it'r agin my principles ter take humin
                  life—whar ye'll git yer desarts, sartin.'</p>
               <p>"Then the leftenant he begun ter parley agin, but I pinted my 'volver at him, an'
                  telled him he'd better be a moseyin' sudden. Sayin' he'd 'port ter his cunnel, he
                  done it.</p>
               <p>"We know'd a hun'red on 'em 'ud be thar in no time, so, soon as they wus out o'
                  sight, the boy an' me, leavin' Black Jake ter luck arter the wimmin, struck a
                  stret line fur the timber. We hedn't got more'n four mile—ter the top uv the tall
                  summit ter the r'ar uv Richmond—afore, luckin' back, we seed my house an' barns
                  all a blazin'! The Heaven-defyin' villuns hed come back—shot Jake down in cold
                  blood, druv my wife an' darter out o' doors, an' burnt all I hed ter the ground!
                  We seed the fire, but not knowin' whot else hed happin'd, an' not bein' able ter
                  do nothin', we piked on inter the woods.</p>
               <p>"We traviled all thet night through the timber, an' jest at sun-down uv the next
                  day, come ter a clarin'. We wus mighty tired, but 'twouldn't do ter sleep thar,
                  fur the trees wus nigh a rod asunder; so we luck'd round, an' on t'other side uv
                  the road, not half a mile off, seed 'bout a acre uv laurel bush—ye knows whot them
                  is, some on 'em so thick a dog karn't git through 'em. Jake war tireder nur I war,
                  an' he said ter me, 'Dad,' sez he: 'let us git under kiver ter onst. I feels loike
                  I couldn't stand up no longer.' It wus fool-hardy loike, fur the sun warn't clar
                  down, but I couldn't b'ar ter see the boy so, an', agin my judgment, we went down
                  the road ter the laurels. We lay thar till mornin', an' slep' so sound thet I
                  reckon ef forty yerthquakes hed shuck the yerth, they wouldn't hev woked us. Soon
                  as sun-up, Jake riz, an' went ter the edge uv the thicket ter rekonnoitter. He
                  hedn't stood thar five minnits—right in plain sight, an' not more'n two hun'red
                  rods frum me—afore I yered a shot, an' seed the pore boy throw up his arms, an'
                  fall ter the ground. In less nur no time fifty Secesh wus on him. I war springin'
                  up ter go ter him, when suthin' tuck me by the shoulder, helt me back, an' said
                  ter me: 'Ye karn't do nothin' fur him. Leave 'im ter the Lord. Save yerself<pb
                     n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6527-00000085"/> self fur the kentry.' It went agin
                  natur', but it 'peared the LORD'S voice, so I crouched down agin 'mong the bushes.
                  I nuver know'd whot it war thet saved me till nigh a y'ar arterwuds. Then I tuck
                  thet leftenant pris'ner—I could hev shot him, but I guv him his life ter repent
                  in, an' he done it: he's a decent man now, b'longin' ter Cunnel Johnson's
                  rigiment. Wall, I tuck him, an' he said ter me: "I wus aside uv thet pore boy when
                  he war dyin'. He turned his eyes onter me jest as he war goin', an' he said: 'Ye
                  karn't kotch him. He's out o' the bush! Ha! ha!' He said thet, and died. Ter save
                  me, died wuth a lie on his lips! Does ye b'lieve the LORD laid thet agin him, Mr.
                  ——?"</p>
               <p>"No, no! I am sure not. It was a noble action."</p>
               <p>"It 'pears so ter me, but it war loike the boy. He war allers furgettin' himself,
                  an' thinkin' uv other folk. He war all—all the pride uv my life—him an' Sally—but
                  it pleased the LORD ter tuck him afore me—but only fur a time—only fur a
                  time—'fore long I shill hev him agin—agin—up thar—up thar!"</p>
               <p>His emotion choked his utterance for a while. When he resumed, he said:</p>
               <p>"At the eend uv a fortni't, trav'lin' by night an' sleepin' by day, an' livin' on
                  the darkies when my fixin's guv out, I got inter the Union lines 'bove
                  Nashville."</p>
               <p>"And what became of your wife and daughter?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"Lettle Sally went ter har sister. My wife walked eighty mile ter har father's.
                  He's one on yer quality folk, an' a durned old Secesh, but he's got humin natur'
                  in him, an' Sally's safe thar. I'se seed har twice ter his house. The old 'un he's
                  know'd on't, but he hain't nuver said a word."</p>

               <head type="sub">BIBLE'S SCOUTING ADVENTURES.</head>
               <p>BIBLE'S intimate knowledge of the country, and acquaintance with the loyal men of
                  the district, enabled him to perform more actual service to the Union cause than a
                  regiment of men in the ranks. Hiding in the woods, or secreting himself in the
                  houses of his friends by day, he would sally forth by night, and, penetrating far
                  into the rebel lines, frequently gather information of great importance to our
                  army. Often days without food, sleeping out in the cold and the rain, hunted down
                  with blood-hounds, betrayed by pretended friends, waylaid by whole regiments, the
                  mark for a thousand rifles, and with the gallows ever before him, he went on in
                  his perilous work with a single-hearted devotion to his country, and an earnest,
                  child-like reliance on God, that would do honor to the best names in history.</p>
               <p>His scouting adventures would fill a volume, and read more like a romance of the
                  middle ages than a matter-of-fact history of the present time. On one occasion,
                  when about five miles outside of our lines, he came, late at night, upon a party
                  of rebel officers, making merry at the house of a wealthy secessionist. Riding
                  coolly up to the mounted orderly on guard before the door-way, he pinioned his
                  arms, thrust a handkerchief into his mouth, and led him quietly out of hearing.
                  Then bidding him dismount, and tying him to a tree, he removed<pb n="170-171"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000086"/> moved the impromptu gag, and leveling a revolver at
                  his head, said to him:</p>
               <p>"Now, tell me, ye rebel villun, whot whiskey-kags wus ye a watchin' thar? Speak
                  truth, or I'll guv ye free passage ter a hot kentry."</p>
               <p>"Nine ossifers," said the trembling rebel; "a cunnel, two majors, a sargeon, two
                  cap'ns, an' the rest leftenants."</p>
               <p>"Whar's thar weapons?"</p>
               <p>"Thar swords is in the hall-way. None on 'em hain't pistols 'cept the sargeon—he
                  mought hev a 'volver."</p>
               <p>"Whot nigs is they round?"</p>
               <p>"Nary one, I reckon, more'n a old man thar (pointing to the kitchen-building) an'
                  the gals in the house."</p>
               <p>"Wall, I'll let ye go fur this, ef ye's telled the truth. Ef ye hain't, ye'd
                  better be a sayin' yer prayers ter onst, fur the Lord won't yere ye on the t'other
                  side uv Jurdan."</p>
               <p>Fastening his horse in "the timber," and creeping up to the house, he then
                  reconnoitered the kitchen premises. The old man—a stout, stalwart negro of about
                  fifty—sat dozing in the corner, and his wife, a young mulatto woman, was cooking
                  wild fowl over the fire. Opening the door, and placing his finger on his lips to
                  enjoin silence, Bible beckoned to the woman. She came to him, and, looking her
                  full in the eye for a moment, he said to her: "I kin trust ye. Wud ye an' yer old
                  'un loike ter git out o' the claws uv these durned secesh?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, yas, Massa," she replied, "we wud. We's Union! We'd loike ter git 'way,
                  Massa!"</p>
               <p>Then awakening her husband, Bible said to him: "Uncle, wud ye risk yer life fur
                  yer freedom?"</p>
               <p>"Ef dar's a chance, Massa, a right smart chance. Dis dark'y tinks a heap ob his
                  life, he does, Massa. It 'm 'bout all hem got."</p>
               <p>"Yas, yas, I know; but ye shill hev freedom. I'll see ye ter the Free States, ef
                  ye'll holp tuck them secesh ossifers."</p>
               <p>"Holp tuck dem, Massa! Why, dar's a dozen on 'em; dey'd chaw ye up in no time,"
                  exclaimed the astonished African.</p>
               <p>"No, thar hain't a dozen on 'em; thar's only nine; but—ye's a coward," replied the
                  scout.</p>
               <p>"No, I hain't no coward, Massa; but I loikes a chance, Massa, a right smart
                  chance."</p>
               <p>Bible soon convinced the negro that he would have a "right smart chance," and he
                  consented to make the hazardous strike for his freedom. Entering the house, he
                  returned in a few moments to the scout, confirming the sentinel's report: the
                  weapons were reposing quietly in the hall, near the doorway, and the officers,
                  very much the worse for liquor, were carousing with his master in the
                  dining-room.</p>
               <p>Selecting three of the best horses from the stables, Bible directed the yellow
                  woman to lead them into the road, and to bring his own from where it was fastened
                  in the woods. Then, with his sooty ally, the scout entered the mansion. Removing
                  the arms from the hall, he walked boldly into the dining-room. "Gentlemen," he
                  said, pointing his pistols—one in each hand—at the rebel officers, "ye is my
                  pris'ners. Surrender yer shootin' irons, or ye's dade men."</p>
               <p>"Who are you?" exclaimed one of them, as they all sprang to their feet.</p>
               <p>"Cunnel Smith, uv the Fust Tennessee Nigger Regiment—one old black man an' a
                  yaller 'ooman," coolly replied the scout.</p>
               <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6527-00000087"/>
               <p>"Go to ——," shouted the surgeon, quickly drawing his revolver, and discharging it
                  directly at Bible's face. The ball grazed his head, cut off a lock of hair just
                  above his ear, and lodged in the wall at his back. The report was still sounding
                  through the apartment, when the surgeon uttered a wild cry, sprang a few feet into
                  the air, and fell lifeless to the floor! The negro had shot him.</p>
               <p>"Come, gentlemen, none o' thet," said Bible, as coolly as if nothing had happened,
                  "guv me the shootin' iron, an' surrender, or we'll sot the rest on ye ter his
                  wuck—rakin' coals fur the devil's funnace—in less nur a minnit."</p>
               <p>Without more hesitation the rebel colonel handed the scout the fallen man's
                  pistol, and then all, followed by the scout and the negro, marched quietly out of
                  the front door. The mulatto woman, holding the horses, was standing in the
                  highway.</p>
               <p>"Hitch the nags, my purty gal," said the scout, "an' git a coil. An' ye,
                  gentlemen, sot down, an' say nothin'—'cept it mought be yer prayers; but them, I
                  reckon, ye hain't larned yit."</p>
               <p>The negress soon returned with the rope, and while Bible and her husband covered
                  them with their revolvers, she tied the arms of the prostrate chivalry. When this
                  was done, the scout affixed a long rope to the waist of the officer on either
                  flank of the column, and, taking one in his own hand, and giving the other to the
                  negro, cried out:</p>
               <p>"Sogers uv the Fust Tennessee! Mount!"</p>
               <p>The regiment bounded into the saddle, and in that plight—the planter and the eight
                  captive officers marching on before, the self-appointed "cunnel" and his chief
                  officer bringing up the rear, and the rest of his command—the yellow
                     woman—<emph>a-straddle</emph> of a horse between them, they entered the Union
                  lines.</p>
               <p>On another occasion, hunted down by several companies of rebel cavalry, Bible took
                  refuge in a grove of laurel bushes. Among the bushes was a hollow tree in which he
                  had once or twice slept on previous expeditions. It had been overthrown by a
                  tornado, and the soil still clung, in huge bowlders, to its upturned roots.
                  Creeping into this tree, he closed the small opening with earth, and, boring a
                  hole through the trunk with his bowie-knife to admit air, and give him a look-out
                  on his pursuers, he lay there without food for three days and nights. The rebels
                  saw him enter the grove, and at once surrounded it, so that escape was impossible.
                  A party then beat the bushes, and after examining every square yard of the ground,
                  came and sat upon the hollow tree. Listening, he heard them recount some of his
                  exploits, and assert very positively, that he had sold himself to that notorious
                  dealer in human chattels—the devil—who, they thought, had given him power to make
                  himself invisible at will. "An' bein' thet's so, cumrades," very logically
                  remarked one of the number, "doan't it nat'rally foller thet the devil ar' on the
                  Union side, an' moughtent we 'bout so wall guv it up fur a dade beat 'ter
                  onst!"</p>
               <p>When the rebel army retreated from Murfreesboro, its advance column came suddenly
                  upon the scout as he was eating his breakfast in an "oak opening" near the
                  highway. There was no chance of escape or concealment, for the "opening" was
                  covered with immense trees standing fifteen and twenty feet apart, with only a
                  short grass growing between them. Bible was disguised in an immense mass of red
                  hair and beard, and wore a tattered suit of the coarse homespun of the<pb
                     n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6527-00000088"/> district. Knowing he would certainly be
                  discovered, he assumed a vacant, rustic look, and, rising from the ground, gazed
                  stupidly at the soldiery.</p>
               <p>"I say, green one, what are you doing thar?" shouted the officer at the head of
                  the column.</p>
               <p>"I'se loss my cow-brutes, Cunnel," replied the scout; "two right loikely heffers;
                  'un on 'em speckle all over, 'cept the tail, an' thet white'n yer face. Ye hain't
                  seed 'em no whar 'long the road, nohow, hes ye?"</p>
               <p>"No, I hain't seed 'em, no whar, nohow," rejoined the officer. "Come, step into
                  the ranks; we need just such fellows as you are. Why the devil haven't they
                  conscripted you before. Step into the ranks, I say," he repeated, as Bible, not
                  seeming to comprehend his meaning, remained standing in his previous position. The
                  second command having no more effect on him than the first, the officer directed a
                  couple of soldiers to take Bible between them, and to fall in at the rear of the
                  column. It was not till he was fairly in the road that the scout seemed to awaken
                  to the reality of his condition.</p>
               <p>"Why, why, ye hain't a gwine to tuck me long o' ye!" he exclaimed, frantically
                  appealing to the "cunnel." "Ye hain't a gwine ter tuck me long o' ye! Ye karn't
                  mean thet!"</p>
               <p>"We do mean that, and you just keep quiet, or, like St. Paul, you'll fight against
                  the pricks," said the officer, alluding perhaps to the bayonets which the two
                  soldiers had unslung and were holding ready to apply to Bible's flanks.</p>
               <p>"Why, ye karn't mean thet! ye karn't mean thet, Cunnel!" again piteously cried the
                  scout. "Wh—wh—whot'll become on the old 'ooman—whot'll become on the
                  cow-brutes?"</p>
               <p>"D—d the old woman and the cow-brutes," shouted the officer, riding forward and
                  leaving the new recruit to his fate. And thus Bible marched to the Tullahoma, and
                  thus he enlisted in the second regiment of Alabama Infantry.</p>
               <p>He remained a fortnight at Tullahoma, and while there obtained a correct idea of
                  the number and disposition of the enemies' forces, and brought away with him, in
                  his head, an accurate map of the rebel fortifications. Desertions being frequent,
                  the picket lines had been doubled, and when he was ready to leave, it had become
                  next to impossible to penetrate them. But he was equal to the emergency, and hit
                  upon a bold expedient which proved successful.</p>
               <p>Restrictions had been laid by the commanding general on the importation of
                  whiskey, and the use of that article, which is a sort of necessity to the Southern
                  "native," had been prohibited within the lines of the army—except on the eve of
                  battle. Then the cold-water generals, themselves, dealt it out—mixed with
                  gunpowder—to every man in the ranks. The regulations concerning it were rigidly
                  enforced in all the divisions except Hardee's. That general—to whose corps Bible
                  belonged—who has, notoriously, a weakness for "spirits" and negro women, winked at
                  the indulgence of his men in those luxuries, when it did not interfere with their
                  strict observance of "Hardee's Tactics."</p>
               <p>Knowing his proclivities, Bible, one evening just after sunset, took a tin "jug"
                  under his arm, and sauntered past the general's tent.</p>
               <p>"I say," shouted Hardee, catching sight of the long form of the scout, "where are
                  you going with that big canteen?"</p>
               <p>"Ter git some bust-head, giniral. Ye knows we karn't live wuthout thet," replied
                  Bible, with affected simplicity.</p>
               <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6527-00000089"/>
               <p>"Perhaps you karn't: don't you know it's against regulations. I'll string you up,
                  and give you fifty."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! ye woan't do thet, I knows, giniral, fur ye's a feller feelin' for we
                  pore sogers," said Bible. "We karn't live wuthout a leetle ruin; wuthout a leetle,
                  nohow, giniral!"</p>
               <p>"Where do you expect to get it?" asked the general.</p>
               <p>"Ter Squire Pursley's," said the scout, naming a planter living a few miles
                  outside of the lines. "He's got some on the tallest old rye ye uver seed. I knows
                  him. An' he's the biggest brandy, too, an' the purtiest nigger gal (rolling his
                  tongue in his mouth and smacking his lips,) thar is anywhar round. She's whiter'n
                  ye is, giniral, an' the snuggest piece uv house furnitur' as uver wus grow'd."</p>
               <p>"And how do you expect to pass the pickets?" asked the standard authority on
                  "Tactics."</p>
               <p>"I reckon' this wull brung 'em," answered Bible, tapping his canteen
                  significantly.</p>
               <p>"Well, it won't," replied the general, laughing; "but I'll give you something that
                  will. And here, take this canteen and get me some of that 'big brandy,' and tell
                  the squire I'll be over there one of these days."</p>
               <p>The general gave Bible a pass, another canteen, and five dollars of Confederate
                  scrip, to effectually "raise the spirits;" and then the scout, saying, "Ye kin
                  reckon on gittin' sich brandy, giniral, as wull sot ye up so high ye'll nuver come
                  down agin,' walked leisurely out of the rebel lines.</p>
               <p>Once, while scouting near McMinnville, Bible was captured by a small party of
                  Forrest's cavalry. One of the Confederates knew him, and he was told he must die.
                  Throwing a rope over the limb of a tree, they adjusted it about his neck, and the
                  rebel officer, taking out his watch, said to him: "You can have five minutes to
                  say your prayers."</p>
               <p>"I thanks ye, Cap'n," said Bible; "fur thet shows ye's got a spark uv humin
                  feelin' in ye; an' ef ye'll jest pile a lettle light 'ood on ter thet spark, it
                  mought be it 'ud blaze up, an' make ye a better man nur ye is, or kin be, whiles
                  ye's a fightin' agin' yer kentry. As ter prayin', Cap'n, I doan't need no time fur
                  thet; fur I'se allers a prayin', not wuth words—but silent, deep, down
                  yere"—placing his hand on his heart—"whar I'se allers a sayin' 'OUR FATHER!'
                     <emph>Our</emph> FATHER, Capt'n, <emph>your'n</emph> as wull as mine! An'
                  doan't ye 'spose He's luckin down on ye now, sorry, grieved ter His vury heart
                  thet ye, His chile, thet His own SON died a wus death nur this fur, should be a

                  it'r His wull, or ye wouldn't be a doin' on it—but sorry thet ye's lifted yer hand
                  agin' yer kentry, agin truth, an' right an' the vury liberty ye talks so much
                  about. Prayin'! I'se allers a prayin', Cap'n, allers been a prayin' uver sense
                  Sally said ter me: 'Pray, Bible, fur it'r the only way ye kin come nigh ter Him:
                  it'r the only way ye kin know, fur shore, thet ye's His raal chile.' An' I does
                  know I'se His chile, 'case I loves ter pray, an' I'll pray fur ye, Cap'n—ye needs
                  it more nur me. It woan't do ye no hurt, an' it mought do ye some good, fur the
                  LORD promises ter yere His chillen, an' He hes yered <emph>me,</emph> over an'
                  over agin."</p>
               <p>The five minutes had elapsed, but the Confederate officer still stood with his
                  watch in his hand. At last, turning suddenly away, he said to his men:</p>
               <p>"Take off the rope! Take him to the general. <emph>He</emph> may do what he likes
                  with him. I'll be d—d if <emph>I'll</emph> hang him."</p>
               <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6527-00000090"/>
               <p>Before they reached Forrest's head-quarters at McMinnville, they were set upon by
                  a squad of Union cavalry, who rescued the prisoner, captured a half dozen of the
                  privates, and gave the captain a mortal wound in the side. Bible laid him upon the
                  grass, and, taking his head tenderly in his lap, prayed for him. As the Captain
                  turned his eyes to take a last look at the setting sun, he placed the scout's hand
                  against his heart, and saying, "I'm going now—I feel at peace—I owe it to you—GOD
                  bless you for it, may GOD for ever bless you," he uttered a low moan, and
                  died.</p>
               <p>While the rebel forces lay encamped around Chattanooga, Bible made them a
                  professional visit. For two days, from the top of Lookout Mountain, he looked down
                  on their fortifications. With the works fully mapped in his mind, so that, in his
                  rude way, he could sketch them upon paper, he started, just at nightfall of a
                  murky, stormy day, to make his way northward. Arriving at the house of a pretended
                  friend, he took supper, and retired to sleep in a small room on the ground floor.
                  It was not far from eleven o'clock, and raining and blowing violently, when a
                  light rap came at his window. He got up—he always slept in his clothes, with his
                  arms about him—and applying his ear to the glass, heard a low voice say:</p>
               <p>"Ye is betrayed. Come out ter onst. They'll be yere in a hour."</p>
               <p>He lifted the sash, and, springing lightly into the yard, saw—as well as the night
                  would permit—a young octoroon woman standing unprotected in the storm, thinly
                  clad, and drenched from head to foot. Leading him out into the darkness, she said
                  to him:</p>
               <p>"This man's son war at master's house not a hour back. He's telled on ye ter git
                  the reward! They's 'spectin' the calvary uvery minnit. Hark! I yere's 'em
                  now!"</p>
               <p>While she yet spoke he heard the heavy tramp of horsemen along the highway.
                  Placing her hand in his, the woman fled hurriedly to the woods. When they had gone
                  about a mile, she paused, and said to him:</p>
               <p>"I karn't go no furder. I must git home or they'll 'spect suthin'. When they find
                  ye's gone, the calvary'll make fur the landin'. Ye must go up the river, an' 'bout
                  two mile frum yere ye'll find a yawl. It'r chained, but ye kin break thet. Doan't
                  cross over—a hull regiment is 'camped on t'other side—put up the river so fur as
                  ye kin."</p>
               <p>With a mutual "God bless ye," they parted. Bible made his way to the river, and
                  narrowly inspected its banks, but no boat was to be seen! He had spent two hours
                  in the search, when he came to a bend in the stream which gave him an
                  uninterrupted view of it for miles below. All along the river the air was alive
                  with torches hurrying to and fro. He knew his pursuers would soon be upon him, and
                  ejaculating a short prayer, in which he reminded the LORD that the information he
                  carried in his head was of "no oncommon vallu, orter be got ter the giniral ter
                  onst, an' wouldn't be uv no yerthly use" if he were hanged just then, he crept
                  down to the water. Entangled in the underbrush just above him was a large log, the
                  estray property of some up-country sawyer. Dropping himself into the water, he
                  made his way to the log, and, laying down on at it full length, paddled out into
                  the river. When he had reached the middle of the stream, he let himself drift down
                  with the current, and in a short time was among his pursuers. A thousand torches
                  blazing on either bank lit up the narrow river with a<pb n="180-181"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000091"/> lurid glare, and made the smallest object on its
                  surface distinctly visible. Knowing that if he kept his position he would
                  certainly be seen, Bible rolled off into the water, turned over on his back, and,
                  keeping one hand upon the log, floated along beside it. When he came opposite to
                  the landing, he heard one cavalryman say to another:</p>
               <p>"See! thar's a log; moughtent the durned critter be on thet?"</p>
               <p>"No," replied the other; "thar's nothin' on it. Yer eyes is no better 'n
                  moles."</p>
               <p>"Wall, I'll guv it a shot, anyhow," rejoined the first, and fired his carbine. The
                  bullet glanced from the log, and struck the water a few feet from the scout. The
                  one shot attracted others, and for a few minutes the balls fell thickly around
                  him, but he escaped unhurt! The GOD to whom he had prayed shielded him, and
                  brought him safely out of the hands of his enemies. In six days, after
                  unparalleled hardships, he reached the Union lines.</p>
               <p>A few days before I left Murfreesboro, Bible started on another trip into the
                  enemies' lines to establish a chain of spy stations up to Bragg's head-quarters.
                  He succeeded in the perilous enterprise, and, when I last heard of him, was
                  pursuing his usual avocation, doing really more service to the country than many a
                  star-shouldered gentleman who is talked of now in the newspapers, and may be read
                  of centuries hence in history.</p>
               <p>If I have outlined his character distinctly, the reader has perceived that he is
                  brave, simple-hearted, outspoken, hospitable, enterprising, industrious, loyal to
                  liberty, earnest in his convictions—though ignorantly confounding names with
                  things—a good husband and father, with a quiet humor which flavors character as
                  Worcester sauce flavors a good dinner, a practical wisdom which "trusts in the
                  LORD, but keeps its powder dry," some talent for bragging, and that intensity of
                  nature and disposition to magnify every thing (illustrated in his stories and
                  conversation) which leads the Southerner to do nothing by halves, to throw his
                  whole soul into whatever he undertakes, to be, like Jeremiah's figs, "if good,
                  very good; if bad, not fit to feed the pigs." Though morally and intellectually
                  superior to the mass of "poor Southern whites," he is still a good representative
                  of the class. They nearly all possess the same traits that he does, and differ
                  from him only in degree, not in kind. That is saying little against them, for one
                  might travel a whole summer's day in our Northern cities, and not meet many men
                  who, in all that makes true manhood, are his equals.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE "POOR WHITES."</head>
               <p>PROFESSOR CAIRNES, in his very valuable and generally accurate work on the Slave
                  Power (pages 54, 55), says:</p>
               <p>"In the Southern States, no less than five millions of human beings are now said
                  to exist in a condition little removed from savage life, eking out a wretched
                  subsistence by hunting, by fishing, by hiring themselves out for occasional jobs,
                  and by plunder. Combining the restlessness and contempt for regular industry
                  peculiar to the savage, with the vices of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >prolétaire</foreign> of civilized communities, these people make up a class at
                  once degraded and dangerous; and constantly re-enforced, as they are, by all that
                  is idle, worthless, and lawless among the population of the neighboring States,
                  form an inexhaustible preserve of ruffianism, ready at hand for all the worst
                  purposes of Southern ambition. Such are the "mean whites" or "white trash" of the
                  Southern States. This class comprises, as I have said, five millions of human
                  beings—about seven-tenths of the whole white population."</p>
               <p>This opinion of Professor Cairnes is no doubt held by fully nineteen-twentieths of
                  the people of the Northern States and of England. But it is a great—a very great
                  error. Having read of, or seen, the wretched specimens of humanity who loiter
                  about the railway stations, or hover around the large plantations on the great
                  Southern thoroughfares, they have jumped to the conclusion that they represent
                  "seven-tenths of the whole white population" of the South! The very idea is
                  preposterous, for if it were so, one-half of the Southern people would be paupers,
                  and no community could exist which had to support that proportion of
                  non-producers. But it is not so. The great mass of "poor whites" are superior (and
                  I say this with due deliberation, and after sixteen years' acquaintance with them)
                  to every other class of un-cultivated men, save our Northern farmers, on the
                  globe. They <emph>all</emph> were born in this country, and have imbibed from our
                  institutions—distorted and perverted as they are at the South—a sturdy
                  independence, and an honest regard for each other's rights, which make them,
                  though of Scotch, Scotch-Irish, or English descent, better soldiers, better
                  citizens, and better <emph>men</emph> than the over-worked, ignorant,
                  half-starved, turbulent, and degraded peasantry whom England vomits upon the North
                  to create riots, rule in our elections, and support such politicians as Fernando
                  Wood.</p>
               <p>There <emph>is</emph> at the South such a class as Mr. Cairnes speaks of. They are
                  appropriately called "mean trash," and "eke out a wretched subsistence by hunting,
                  by fishing, by hiring themselves out for occasional jobs, and by plunder," but
                  they are a comparatively small class. The census shows that they cannot number
                  above half a million.</p>
               <p>These people do combine "the restlessness and contempt for regular industry
                  peculiar to the savage, with the vices of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >prolétaire</foreign> of civilized communities," are "at once degraded and
                  dangerous," and form a "preserve of ruffianism, ready at hand for all the worst
                  purposes of Southern ambition." In fact, I was about to add that <emph>all</emph>
                  the ruffianism of the South is confined to<pb n="184-185"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000093"/> them and to the "chivalry," but I will not say it,
                  for it would be strictly true.</p>
               <p>To give the reader an idea of what these "mean whites" are, I will glance for a
                  moment at their habits and ways of living. Often their houses are the rude pole
                  wigwams of the Indian—shaped like a sugar-loaf—with merely a hole at the top to
                  let the smoke out, and—the rain in; but, generally, they live in small huts of
                  rough logs, through the crevices of which the wind, in winter, whistles a most
                  melancholy tune. These huts are floored with nothing but the ground—hardened with
                  mauls, and hollowed at the centre, as if to hold the rain that comes in at the
                  roof—and their one apartment is furnished with a few rickety chairs, a pine
                  log—hewn smooth on the upper side, and made to serve as a sofa—a cracked skillet,
                  a dirty frying-pan an old-fashioned rifle, two or three sleepy dogs, and a baker's
                  dozen of half-clad children, with skins and hair colored like a tallow candle
                  dipped in tobacco-juice. In one corner may be a mud oven, half crumbled back to
                  its original earth, and in the others, two or three low beds, with corn-shuck
                  mattresses and tattered furnishings; but the whole aspect of the place reminds one
                  strongly of a tolerably-kept swine-sty or dog-kennel. The character of the inmates
                  of these hovels is suited to their surroundings. They are indolent, shiftless, and
                  thieving; given to whiskey-drinking, snuff-dipping, clay-eating, and all manner of
                  social vices. Brothers intermarry with sisters, fathers cohabit with daughters,
                  and husbands sell, or barter away, their wives, as freely as they would their
                  hounds, or as the planter would his slaves. I have myself met a number of these
                     <emph>white</emph> women who had been sold into prostitution by their natural
                  protectors, for a few dollars or a good rifle.</p>
               <p>Their indolence is almost past belief. They are literally "too lazy to come in
                  when it rains." A traveler tells of asking shelter at one of their shanties in a
                  storm. The rain was pouring in at the roof, and the family were huddled about the
                  only dry spot on the floor.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you mend your roof?" the traveler asked.</p>
               <p>"Stranger," replied the host, "we can't do it—it rains."</p>
               <p>"But it doesn't always rain—why not mend it in dry weather?"</p>
               <p>"Why, wh—whot's the use o' mendin' it when it doan't leak?" was the very sensible
                  reply.</p>
               <p>Still, they have a mortal antipathy to water. They never take it outwardly, unless
                  the roof leaks, or they are caught out in a rain-storm, and never inwardly, unless
                  it is mixed with apple-jack or whiskey. Whiskey is their staple beverage. By
                  exchanging deer or other game (their only currency) at some cross-road doggery,
                  they obtain plentiful supplies of a vile fluid, which is compounded of log-wood,
                  strychnine, juniper berries, and alcohol, and "circulates" among them under the
                  appropriate names of "Tangle-foot," "Blue-ruin," "Red-eye," "Bust-head," and
                  "Knock-'em-stiff." If the vender of this vile stuff did not dilute it freely with
                  water—so freely that it rarely fails to itself "get tight" in cold weather—the
                  race of mean Southern whites" would soon be swept from the earth. As it is, they
                  seem to thrive and fatten upon it; old men, dozing away in the chimney-corner, and
                  little children, tottling about the floor, drink it as if it were water.</p>
               <p>A Northern man was once forced to dine at one of then, hovels. Missing the
                  customary "whiskey-kag" from the table, he said to the housewife:</p>
               <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6527-00000094"/>
               <p>"Can't you give me a mug of Knock-'em-stiff?"</p>
               <p>"I can't, Stranger," was her reply: "I hain't nary drap ter speer."</p>
               <p>"None to spare! Why, I see a barrel of it there in the corner!"</p>
               <p>"A barr'l uv it!" exclaimed the woman, "why, whot's thet fur a lone widder an'
                  sevin chillen? We shill be nation dry 'fore winter's over!"</p>
               <p>Not one in a thousand of these people can read, and not one in <emph>ten</emph>
                  thousand can write. I have known many who never saw a book or a newspaper, and
                  some who never <emph>heard</emph> of a Bible or a spelling-book. As a consequence
                  of such ignorance, they have very crude notions of God and religious duty. In
                  fact, though they often spend weeks at camp-meetings, shouting "Glory" and
                  groaning "Old Hundred," they have no religion. I once heard one of their preachers
                  deliver a sermon which well illustrated their knowledge of <emph>spiritual</emph>
                  things.</p>
               <p>It was at a little church in the shadow of Bald mountain, one of the immense range
                  dividing North Carolina from Tennessee.</p>
               <p>The building was a simple structure of logs, with a puncheon floor, and a single
                  opening for a door, but without a window or a chimney. On a bare spot in its
                  centre a huge light-wood fire was blazing, and roaring, and fuming and forcing
                  thick volumes of smoke into the people's eyes till they wept as if they were so
                  many watering-pots. The congregation was seated around this fire on benches of
                  rough logs, and the preacher occupied a small platform, raised a few steps from
                  the floor, and furnished with a single block of wood which officiated as a chair.
                  The women had bare heads and feet, and their only garment (it was the month of
                  November) seemed to be a coarse cottonade gown, falling straight from the neck to
                  just below the knees. The men had long matted hair and shaggy beards, and wore
                  slouched hats (they kept them on during the services), and linsey trowsers, and
                  hunting shirts, so begrimed with dirt, and so torn and patched in a thousand
                  places, that scarcely a vestige of the original material was left visible to the
                  naked eye. Many of them—owing, no doubt, to their custom of intermarrying—were
                  deformed and apparently idiotic, and they all had stunted, aguedistorted bodies,
                  untanned-leather skins, small heads, round as a bullet, and coarse, wiry hair,
                  which looked like shreds of oakum gathered into mops, and dyed with
                  lamp-black.</p>
               <p>The preacher's text, which he credited to the <emph>apostle</emph> DAVID, was:
                  "Try the sperrets;" and he showed, to the satisfaction of his auditory, that while
                  Scripture expressly enjoins the taking of "a little wine"—which, he said, was the
                  ancient name for whiskey—"for the stomach's sake," it as expressly requires that
                  we shall "try the sperrets," or, in other words, that we shall drink none but the
                  very best whiskey we can get. He reckoned "thet sech ruin as come from 'Hio, an'
                  could be got ter Jim Decker's—over the mountain ter Jonesboro—fur a coon-skin a
                  gallon, was purty tollable sort o' ruin, an' mought do fur white folk, but sech as
                  Dan Ferguson 'stilled, down thar ter the mill, warn't no way fit fur a hoss ter
                  drink." He belabored bad whiskey, for a time, with savage vehemence, and then
                  opened his batteries upon tobacco. Whiskey was, as the Bible affirms, good for the
                  stomach, and he reckoned the "clar stuff wouldn't hurt no part uv a humin bein',"
                  but tobacco was a vile thing that would kill any living creature but woman; and
                  how she could chaw it, and smoke it, and snuff it, and dip it, as she did, he
                  couldn't see, no how. Its use warn't noway sanctioned<pb n="188-189"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000095"/> by Scriptur,' and nary one uv the Apostles,
                  Prophets, or good men of the olden time uver used it; and while the Bible often
                  spoke of wine and "sperrets, it nuver onst mentioned the name uv terbacker, and
                  that proved it couldn't be good ter take!"</p>
               <p>When he had "adjourned the meeting" for a fortnight—PROVIDENCE wullin', an' thar
                  bein' no freshet on the mounting—I ventured to suggest to him that it was possible
                  he had misunderstood his text, and I then learned that he could not read, and that
                  a neighboring planter—one of the chivalry—had given him the text, outlined his
                  subject, told him that the text refers to ardent spirits, and that he must be sure
                  to "pitch powerful strong inter Dan Ferguson's whiskey."</p>
               <p>[The men who can thus sport with the best feelings of their fellows, are, as we
                  know, capable of worse things.]</p>
               <p>Nowhere but in the Slave States is there a class of whites so ignorant and so
                  degraded as are these people. In every other country the peasantry labor, are the
                  principal producers, the really indispensable part of the community; but the "mean
                  white" of the South does not <emph>know how</emph> to labor; he produces nothing;
                  he is a fungous growth on the body of society, absorbing the strength and life of
                  its other parts, and he would not exist if the Southern system were in a healthy
                  state. And he is the natural product of Slavery, for slavery, which makes the
                  slave the planter's blacksmith, and wheelwright, and carpenter, and artisan of all
                  work, shuts upon the mean white man every avenue of honest toil, and drives him to
                  the barren sandhills to starve and to die.</p>
               <p>He steals the deer from the planter's forests, the hams from his smoke-houses, and
                  the chickens from his hen-roosts, and he vends corruption and bad whiskey among
                  the negroes; but the planter tolerates him for his vote. I have seen a planter
                  march twenty of these wretched caricatures of humanity up to the polls, and when
                  they had voted at his bidding, have had him turn to me and say, with a sneer on
                  his lips:</p>
               <p>"This is your boasted Democracy; this trash governs this country; Jefferson gave
                  them the right of suffrage, and they suppose they are voting for Jefferson
                     <emph>now.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"But," I said to him, "why do you not let them think? why not give them schools
                  and work?"</p>
               <p>"Because," he replied, "if we did, they might not vote for Jefferson!"</p>
               <p>To these "mean whites," Mr. Cairnes's description appropriately applies, and it
                  applies <emph>only</emph> to them. The great mass of poor whites, as I have said,
                  are a very different people. The <emph>poor</emph> white man labors, the
                     <emph>mean</emph> white man does not labor; and labor marks the distinction
                  between them. Labor makes one hardy, industrious, and enterprising, a law-abiding
                  and useful citizen; idleness makes the other thieving, vicious, law-breaking, and
                  of "no sort of account" to himself or society.</p>
               <p>The <emph>laboring</emph> whites comprise two-thirds of the free population of the
                  South, and they have done more for its material progress than all its "chivalry"
                  and all its slaves. They have done more, because they have worked under the
                  stimulus of freedom, and because they vastly <emph>outnumber</emph> the other
                  classes. The census shows that on the first of June, 1860, there were in the
                  fourteen Slave States, exclusive of Delaware, one million, three hundred and
                  fifty-nine thousand, six hundred and fifty-five white males engaged in
                  agricultural and other out-door employments. Of this number, nine hundred and one
                  thousand, one hundred and two are classed as "farmers"—men who till their<pb
                     n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6527-00000096"/> own land: two hundred and thirty
                  thousand, one hundred and forty-six are classed as "farm-laborers"—men who till
                  the land of others: and two hundred and twenty-eight thousand, four hundred and
                  seven are classed as "laborers"—men engaged in out-door work other than the
                  tillage of land. The "farmers" are not to be confounded with the planters—men who
                  work large tracts of land and large bodies of slaves, but do not work
                  themselves—for the census takes distinct account of the latter. <emph>They</emph>
                  number only eighty-five thousand, five hundred and fifty-eight, but—such has been
                  the working of the peculiar institution—they own nearly three-fourths of the
                  negroes and landed property of the South. These one million, three hundred and odd
                  thousand of laboring white men represent a population of about six millions; and
                  if we add to them the four hundred thousand represented by the planters, and the
                  one million represented by men in trade, manufactures, and the professions, there
                  can hardly remain, in a total population of less than eight millions, "five
                  millions of human beings who eke out a wretched subsistence by hunting, by
                  fishing, by hiring themselves out for occasional jobs, and by plunder." Half a
                  million—the number I before stated—is vastly nearer the truth.</p>
               <p>Little is known at the North of this large working population, for the reason that
                  they live remote from the great traveled routes, and have been seldom seen by
                  travelers. They are scattered over all the South, but are most numerous in the
                  Border States and in Texas. The most of them own small farms, and till the soil
                  with their own hands. Some of them have one or two slaves, and in rare instances
                  the more industrious have acquired ten or fifteen—but they work with the blacks in
                  the fields, and treat them very much as our Northern farmers treat their hired
                  workmen. Before the war the traveler in the interior of North Carolina would have
                  heard the axe of master and man falling, with alternate strokes, in the depths of
                  the evergreen forests, or he would have seen the two "camped out" together in the
                  same tent or pine-pole cabin, drinking from the same gourd—the darky always after
                  his master—eating from the same rude table, and sharing the same bed—the cabin
                  floor—in common. So, too, in Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Western Virginia, and
                  middle and upper Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, he would have seen the white
                  and the black ploughing side by side, or, bared to the waist, swinging the
                  old-fashioned scythe, in good-natured rivalry as to which could cut the broadest
                  swath of yellow wheat or waving timothy, or tote the biggest bundle of corn to the
                  evening husking-bee. And when the evening had come, he would have found them
                  gathered in the old log barn, husking, and singing, and shouting, and dancing in
                  company, to the tune of "Ole Virginny," or "Rose, Rose, de coal brack Rose,"
                  played by "old Uncle Ned," who "had no wool on de top ob his head," but whose
                  skinny fingers, with handy blows, <emph>could</emph> rap the music out of "de ole
                  banjoes."</p>
               <p>The more wealthy of this class sometimes give their children what might be called
                  a fair common-school education, but fully one-half of them never learn to read or
                  write. The reason of this is, there are no schools for the common people at the
                  South. In a village, ten or twenty miles distant, there may be a pretentious
                  "Female College," or "Institute of Learning for Young Men," where "a little Latin
                  and less Greek" is dispensed to the young idea at the rate of four or five hundred
                  dollars per annum, but these prices place their "stores of knowledge" far above
                  the reach of the hard-toiling farmer. Only in Tennessee, so far<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000097"/> as I know, are there any free schools, and the
                  scanty State allowance which formerly supported them, was dealt out with a most
                  parsimonious hand by the ruling aristocracy. How much light those institutions
                  gave the people, may be guessed at from the fact that any one was qualified to
                  instruct in them who could "read, write, and do sums in addition."</p>
               <p>So many of these people being unable to read, it may be inferred they generally do
                  not "take the papers." They do not. And why should they? Would it be wisdom in the
                  Southern farmer, when his wife and children were barefoot, and the wolf—hunger—was
                  looking in at his door, to waste one-tenth of his only bale of cotton on a
                  wretched hebdomadal, filled with Secession, slavery, and negro advertisements,
                  whose stupid editorial he would be a fortnight in spelling out?</p>
               <p>As he does not read, he has to derive his knowledge of current events and
                  political affairs from his wealthier neighbor, who does read, and who is sure to
                  be a slave-owner, and one of the self-baptized "chivalry." At a political
                  barbacue, or a court-day gathering, the farmer may hear, once or twice in the
                  year, the two sides of every national question but the, to him, all-important one
                  of slavery. If that subject is at all touched upon on such an occasion, it is
                  shown to be of divine origin—dating back to the time when Ham first cast a black
                  shadow across his looking-glass, and only to end when the skins of his descendants
                  no longer wear mourning for their forefather's sin.</p>
               <p>Thus ignorant, and thus instructed, is it strange that the Southern farmer deems
                  slavery altogether lovelier than freedom? What does he know of freedom? What does
                  he know of what it has done for the poor man of the North? Nothing. He never saw a
                  Northern man in all his life, except, it may be, a Yankee pedlar, and he—my Yankee
                  friends will, I hope, take no offence at my saying this, for I am a Yankee
                  myself—he, when he migrates South, develops into about the meanest specimen of
                  humanity to be found on this planet.</p>
               <p>If the Southern workingman knew what freedom is; if he knew what it does at the
                  North; how it builds a free school at every cross-road, while knowledge is saddled
                  with a Morrill tariff at the South; how it makes the Northern laborer
                  comparatively rich, while <emph>he</emph> is wretchedly poor; how it gives the
                  Northern farmer a comfortable home for himself and out-buildings for his cattle,
                  while <emph>he</emph> lodges in a mud-chinked hovel, and stables his cows in the
                  woods; how the Northern workingman travels in luxurious steamboats or
                  velvet-cushioned cars, while <emph>he</emph> journeys on the hurricane deck of a
                  mule, or in that sort of railway train that will climb the steepest grade, if it
                  only has time enough—an ox-cart drawn by a single two-year-old heifer; how the
                  Northern farmer is respected and honored <emph>because</emph> he labors, while
                     <emph>he</emph> is looked down upon and despised for doing the same thing; how
                  the poorest Northern man votes, independently and intelligently, as one of the
                  real "sovereigns of the nation," while he, misled by a stump speech, or bribed by
                  a glass of whiskey, ignorantly casts his ballot for the very men who are robbing
                  him of his birth-right: if he knew all this, would he not crush slavery, and end
                  the rebellion in a day? He would. And slavery will not be effectually crushed, or
                  the Rebellion ended, until he <emph>does</emph> know it. We may overrun the South,
                  we may make its fields a desolation, and its cities heaps of ruin, but until we
                  reach the reason and the hearts of these men, we shall stand ever on the crater of
                  a volcano, whose red-hot lava may at any hour again burst forth and deluge the
                     land<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6527-00000098"/> with blood and fire! It is idle
                  to talk of conquering a <emph>union</emph> with a disaffected people. It never was
                  done, and never will be done. Ireland, and Italy, and Hungary, ought to convince
                  us of that.</p>
               <p>But how, while every able-bodied Southern man is in the Rebel army, can we reach
                  these people? I answer, by fighting them with a sword in one hand and a Union
                  newspaper in the other—by giving them ideas as well as bullets. By scattering
                  loyal publications broadcast over the conquered districts; and by starting a free
                  press wherever we hold a foot of Southern soil. If the men are away in the army,
                  the women will be at home, and will read these things, and that will be enough. If
                  we convert them, the country is saved. Woman, in this century, is every where that
                  "power behind the throne" which is mightier than the throne itself, and the
                  Southern women have been, and are, the mainspring of this Rebellion. Every dollar
                  that we thus plant in the South will spring up a man, in tattered hat and ragged
                  butternuts, it may be, but still a man, hardy, earnest, brave, who, for what he
                  thinks is right, will march straight up to the cannon's mouth, and meet death "as
                  if he loved it."</p>
               <p>I have been led into this long digression by an earnest desire to disabuse the
                  Northern mind in regard to these people. For this reason I have drawn, at full
                  length, the portraits of "Long Tom" and "Bible Smith" in this volume, and of "Andy
                  Jones" and the farmer "Barnes" in the book "Among the Pines." They are all
                  representatives of this class. I have endeavored to sketch their characters
                  faithfully—extenuating nothing and setting nothing down in malice—that the reader
                  may believe, what I <emph>know,</emph> that there is not in the whole North a more
                  worthy, industrious, enterprising, honest, brave, and liberty-loving loving class
                  of people than the great body of poor Southern whites. Take the heel of the
                  man-buying and woman-whipping aristocrat from off their necks, give them free
                  schools and a chance to rise, and they will make the South, with its prolific
                  soil, its immense water-power, and its vast mineral wealth, such a country as the
                  sun never yet looked upon, and this Union such a Union as will be "the light of
                  the nations and the glory of the earth!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">A DAY WITH ROSECRANS.</head>
               <p>THAT afternoon I sent my letters to the Commanding General, and the next morning,
                  after breakfast, taking particular direction from the "culled gemman" who had been
                  my bearer of dispatches, I set out in search of his quarters. On a side street at
                  a little distance from the centre of the town, I found a modest brick building,
                  from the balcony of which a large flag was flying. Before this house a solitary
                  sentinel was pacing to and fro with a musket on his shoulder, and in the
                  court-yard beyond it, in the shade of a group of tents, half a dozen officers were
                  reading newspapers, or lazily puffing away at their meerschaums. Near by, in the
                  door-way of a smaller building,—an edifice about as large as a half grown
                  hen-coop,—with his body balanced on the legs of a rosewood chair, and his feet
                  braced against the door jam, another soldier was indulging in the delightful
                  employments of his superiors. Approaching this soldier, I said to him:</p>
               <p>"Are these the General's quarters?"</p>
               <p>"Yaw, yaw, General Rosey. Dat is he, dat is he," replied the "adopted citizen,"
                  pointing to an officer on a powerful gray, at the head of a squadron of cavalry,
                  which just then was thundering down the road. The escort halted abreast of the
                  principal entrance, and the officer—a straight, compactly built, quick motioned
                  man, in a rusty uniform, a worn slouched hat, and mud-encrusted cavalry
                  boots—sprang to the ground. A few other officers followed him, and then, without a
                  word being spoken, the cavalry wheeled, and thundered down the road again.</p>
               <p>"And that is the General?" I said to the soldier.</p>
               <p>"Yaw, yaw, dat is old Rosey. I fights mit him."</p>
               <p>"Then, you don't 'fight mit Sigel?'" I rejoined, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Yaw, yaw, I fights mit Segel py-me-by (before.) I fights mit Rosey now. Him
                  better as Sigel."</p>
               <p>Not pausing to discuss the respective merits of the two commanders, I entered the
                  wide hall of the larger building, and said to an orderly on duty near the
                  door-way:</p>
               <p>"Will you take my name to the General?"</p>
               <p>"Av coorse, yer honor," replied the soldier, his mouth distending into a
                  good-natured grin; "but as ye knows it an' I don't, hedn't ye better be after
                  takin' it ter him yerself. Ye'll find him in there."</p>
               <p>Following the direction in which he pointed, I entered a room at the left, on the
                  door of which were posted, in large letters, the words "Aides-de-Camp." It was a
                  square, spacious apartment, with a huge fire-place surmounted by a wooden mantel,
                  a smoke-begrimed ceiling, dingy walls, covered with gaudy paper hangings, and two
                  wide windows looking out upon the street. A camp cot, dressed in a soldier's
                  blanket, and a pair of jackboots, stood in one corner, and in the others were a
                  miscellaneous assortment of swords, spurs, muskets, knapsacks, and kindred
                  articles known to modern warfare. A variety of dilapidated chairs, and
                  canvas-bottomed stools, straggled about the floor, and between the windows was a
                  large round table, littered over with maps, newspapers, and writing utensils.
                     At<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6527-00000100"/> this table were two or three
                  young gentlemen in the uniform of staff officers, and addressing one of them, I
                  asked if the General were "visible" so early in the day. He replied that he was
                  then at breakfast, but that the Chief of Staff could be seen at once. Expressing a
                  desire to meet that gentleman, I was conducted into an adjoining room, of smaller
                  dimensions but furnished in much the same manner as the other. In a corner by the
                  window, seated at a small pine desk,—a sort of packing box, perched on a
                  long-legged stool, and divided into pigeon-holes, with a turn-down lid—was a tall,
                  deep-chested, sinewy built man, with regular, massive features, a full, clear blue
                  eye, slightly dashed with gray, and a high, broad forehead, rising into a ridge
                  over the eyes as if it had been thrown up by a plough. There was something
                  singularly engaging in his open, expressive face, and his whole appearance
                  indicated, as the phrase goes, "great reversed power." His uniform, though cleanly
                  brushed, and setting easily upon him, had a sort of democratic air, and every
                  thing about him seemed to denote that he was "a man of the people." A rusty
                  slouched hat large enough to have fitted Daniel Webster, lay on the desk before
                  him, but a glance at that was not needed to convince me that his head held more
                  than the common share of brains. Though he is yet young—not thirty-three—the
                  reader has heard of him, and if he lives, he will make his name long remembered in
                  our history. He glanced at me as I approached, and when I mentioned my name, rose,
                  and extending his hand in a free, cordial way, said:</p>
               <p>"I am glad to meet you. I have seen your handwriting —— ——, his (X) mark."</p>
               <p>"And I have seen yours," I replied, grasping his hand with equal cordiality. "But,
                     <emph>you</emph> write with a <emph>steel</emph> pen—epics, in the measure of
                  Hail Columbia.<ref rend="super" target="#note_004" xml:id="return_004">*</ref>

                  <p><ref target="#return_004">*</ref>When about to lead the final charge at the battle of Middle-Creek, General
                     Garfield pulled off his coat, tossed it up into a tree and, turning to his
                     men, cried: "Come on, boys! Give them Hail Columbia." The men threw up their
                     caps with a wild shout, rushed at the enemy, and drove them from the field,
                     General Garfield leading the way.</p>
               </note>
               <p>I sat down, and in ten minutes knew him as well as I might have known some other
                  men in ten years. Nearly an hour had slipped away in pleasant chat with him, and
                  my intended interview with Rosecrans was almost forgotten, when Garfield reminded
                  me that I had better see the General before he was overrun with visitors. Opening
                  the door of an inner room, he led me at once into another large, square apartment,
                  which had, like the first, a bare floor, and greasy walls, hung round with maps,
                  and decorated with gaudy paper-hangings, done into panels huge enough to have
                  fitted the "grand hall" of the Mammoth Cave. At the right of the doorway was a
                  high-post bedstead, covered with a spotless white counterpane, and about the room,
                  in appropriate places, were a few hard-bottomed chairs, a pine wash-stand, with
                  earthenware wash-basin, and wooden water-pail, and an old-fashioned sideboard,
                  evidently the left-behind property of the previous occupant. On the mantel were a
                  few books, a brace of revolvers, a silver-hilted sword bearing marks of "actual
                  service," and two or three kerosene lamps, which, to all appearance, had done
                  absolutely nothing towards dispelling the darkness of this "benighted world."
                  Against the wall, by the front window, was a large pine table, surmounted by a
                  frame-work of "pigeon holes," and on it were various open maps, several secession
                  newspapers, some bundles of "official documents" done up in "red tape,"<pb
                     n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6527-00000101"/> and a huge pile of unopened letters.
                  There seemed a place for every thing and every thing seemed in its place, but the
                  mingled air of rustic simplicity and faded gentility which pervaded the room, had
                  a most grotesque effect, and only one object in it at all indicated that it was
                  the private apartment of one of the first military men of the time. That one
                  object was Rosecrans himself.</p>
               <p>He sat bolt upright in a rosewood arm-chair, covered with faded brocatelle, and
                  sadly out at the elbows; and, with a cigar in his mouth, and a knife in his hand,
                  was rapidly dissecting the letters which lay on the table before him. When my name
                  was mentioned he rose, took my hand, and gave me a quick, searching glance. In
                  that glance—I felt it—he sounded me, took my measure—as accurately as if he had
                  been my tailor—and, with unerring decision, fixed my exact place in the scale of
                  creation. From my first entrance into Kentucky, from high and low, black and
                  white, bond and free, military men and civilians, I had heard nothing but
                  extravagant eulogies of this man, and I had come prepared to be disappointed in
                  him; but that one glance, the indescribable smile that passed over his face, and a
                  certain atmosphere of power which seemed to envelop him, made me feel that, for
                  once, the popular estimate was the true one. And no one ever came within his
                  influence without being fascinated as I was, or without feeling, on the instant,
                  the magnetism of a great nature. Motioning me to a seat, and resuming his letters,
                  he said, while another of those peculiar smiles passed over his face:</p>
               <p>"I've been expecting you."</p>
               <p>"Expecting <emph>me,</emph> Sir!" I exclaimed in undisguised astonishment. "I've
                  heard you knew every thing. I reckon it's so."</p>
               <p>"Not exactly, but I knew you were coming. You've been announced," and continuing
                  to open the letters, he handed me one of them.</p>
               <p>It was from the chaplain of an Indiana regiment, whom the red-faced landlord had
                  stowed away in my room one night at Nashville. The worthy gentleman had a plan for
                  educating the blacks in "ten lessons of one hour each," and, not content with
                  boring me with it till two o'clock in the morning, had, without my consent,
                  written Rosecrans referring him to me for "further particulars."</p>
               <p>"What do you know of that man?" he asked, going on with his letters.</p>
               <p>"Nothing. I never saw him."</p>
               <p>"Never saw him!"</p>
               <p>"No. I went to bed without a candle, and he left before I awoke in the
                  morning."</p>
               <p>"But you formed some opinion of him. What was it?"</p>
               <p>"That he knew about as much of the Southern negro, as I know of the moon."</p>
               <p>"I thought so. A mere theorist. Only practical men are fit for the work
                     <emph>we've</emph> in hand Mr. ——. What do <emph>you</emph> think of the
                  negro?"</p>
               <p>"That he is unfortunate in being black," I replied, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, I know. But is he naturally equal to the white man?"</p>
               <p>"Measured by the New Testament standard he may be superior—for he is meek enough
                  to be a slave—but measured by <emph>our</emph> standard, he is certainly inferior.
                  He has not the aggressive qualities of the white man."</p>
               <p>"Well, what shall we do with him?"</p>
               <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6527-00000102"/>
               <p>"Let him alone."</p>
               <p>"You are right," and for a moment he dropped the letters. "Give him a Bible and a
                  spelling-book, free air, and a chance for something more than six feet of God's
                  earth, and, LET HIM ALONE."</p>
               <p>Saying this he dived again into his correspondence.</p>
               <p>"This war will give him all that," I replied.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and it will give it to every working man, black or white. This is the
                  working man's war. For four thousand years labor has been struggling for its
                  rights—now it will get them. Would to God that every poor man, North and South,
                  could realize this."</p>
               <p>He kept on reading, but his fine face flushed, his nervous lip quivered, and his
                  clear, luminous eye actually blazed, as he spoke these words.</p>
               <p>"I am glad you sympathize with the working man," I said.</p>
               <p>"Sympathize with him! I honor him. He is the true nobleman. Did you never read
                  where it says, 'cursed is the ground for <emph>thy sake?</emph>' Does not that
                  mean that God ordained labor for our good? that it is our highest glory?"</p>
               <p>The mass of letters, by this time, had adjusted themselves into several separate
                  heaps, and touching a small bell which stood on the table, he said to a young
                  officer who at once appeared in the doorway: "Tompey, hand these to Goddard, these
                  to Barnett, these to Taylor, and send this to Ducat, and then come here with the
                  Major. I've letters to write. Is any one waiting to see me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; the Medical Director and half a dozen others," answered the aide.</p>
               <p>"Ask them in," and turning to me, he added: "Captain Thompson, this is our guest,
                  Mr. ——. Get him a pass to go and come when he likes. Give him a horse, and a
                  squad, whenever he wants to go outside of the lines. He'll stay with us a month or
                  two."</p>
               <p>"Say a day or two," I interrupted, laughing, "and you'll come nearer the
                  truth."</p>
               <p>"Not a second less than a month. You can't get away till I give you a pass."</p>
               <p>The aide disappeared, and the Medical Director, and the "half a dozen others"
                  entered the room.</p>
               <p>"Good morning, gentlemen. Be seated," said Rosecrans. "What can I do for you,
                  Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"The health of the men, General," replied the Doctor, "with the warm weather
                  coming on, requires more vegetable food. Would it not be well to order
                  potatoes?"</p>
               <p>"I ordered them six weeks ago—sent an officer into Ohio, and for seven thousand
                  dollars he bought what would have cost us twenty-one thousand in Nashville. They
                  ought to have been here before now."</p>
               <p>"General," said the medical man, with unaffected admiration, "you think of every
                  thing."</p>
               <p>"I have to. Good morning, Doctor. Colonel, what can I do for <emph>you?</emph>"
                  added the laconic general, turning to a slightly-built, dark-complexioned young
                  man, and introducing him to me as follows: "Mr. ——, this is one of the McCook's.
                  Colonel Dan. You've heard of him."</p>
               <p>At this moment the aides came in, and seated themselves at the two opposite
                  corners of the pine table. An orderly also entered, and handed the General a note
                  from one of the Corps<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6527-00000103"/> commanders.
                  Rosecrans introduced me to "the Major"—the other aide—dictated to him a reply to
                  the note, and in the same breath said to McCook:</p>
               <p>"Now, Colonel, what is it?"</p>
               <p>"My men," said McCook, "in half an hour yesterday, subscribed four thousand
                  dollars to get the Henry rifle. I want liberty to use it."</p>
               <p>While the Colonel was speaking, the General took up the pile of letters remaining
                  on the table, and began dictating to the two aides.</p>
               <p>"Can they hit an elephant at a hundred paces?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Two hundred of them can hit the head of a candle box three times in five, at
                  three hundred yards," rejoined McCook, a flush of pride on his face. A discussion
                  as to the merits of the different kinds of rifles ensued, but not understanding it
                  then, I cannot report it now. Meanwhile the General was dictating as fast as the
                  two aides could write, and addressing an occasional remark to me. McCook had done
                  speaking, when a very tall, ungainly man, with stooping shoulders, and long white
                  hair, entered the room, and stalking directly up to the General, and taking his
                  hand, said:</p>
               <p>"I'm going by the train. Good-by."</p>
               <p>"Good-by, and God bless you," returned Rosecrans, rising. "If you ever want to
                  come back, we'll find a warm place for you."</p>
               <p>"I know you will. I've had experience of your warm places," rejoined the veteran,
                  smiling.</p>
               <p>"And he likes them," said the General, turning to me. "At Stone River, in the
                  hottest fire, when his men were hugging the ground as if they'd bury themselves,
                  the Parson got up and made them a speech, and they do say, he told them—"</p>
               <p>"No, I didn't. Don't traduce your friends, General," rejoined the Parson,
                  laughing. "Good-by."</p>
               <p>"Good-by, and God bless you," said the General.</p>
               <p>"Good-by, boys, all of you," said the Parson, warmly. Every officer in the room
                  grasped his hand, and amid a chorus of "God bless yous" he went out. It was "the
                  fighting Parson," Colonel Moody of the 74th Ohio.</p>
               <p>A half a dozen others now crowded around and addressed Rosecrans, who replied to
                  each, and at the same time kept on dictating, his words all the while pouring
                  forth in quick, terse sentences, his luminous eyes smiling, and his nervous
                  fingers thrumming an odd accompaniment on the ragged arm of his chair. In all this
                  he manifested no effort. I thought he could have done twice as much had it been
                  possible for words to flow faster. His mind seemed to act with lightning rapidity,
                     <emph>flashing</emph> from premise to conclusion, and grasping with ease half a
                  dozen subjects in almost instantaneous succession. At last I said to him:</p>
               <p>"I have seen business men turn off work, but never any who did it half so fast as
                  you."</p>
               <p>"I have been a business man. There are some relics of my business career. I have
                  credit for those at the Patent Office," he replied, pointing to the lamps on the
                  mantel-piece. They were the "Patent Kerosene Burners, warranted to give out
                  neither smoke nor odor," which every American housewife values, but which every
                  American housewife may not know she owes to a Major-General.</p>
               <p>Another aide then entered, and announced that several ladies<pb n="206-207"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000104"/> of the Sanitary Commission, about to depart by the
                  train, desired to take leave of the General. "Show them in," he replied, rising,
                  and taking a single turn up and down the room. This seemed a well understood
                  signal, for all present except the aides at once left the apartment. I was rising
                  to follow when he said to me: "Don't go. Stay, and after lunch we'll ride out to
                  Sherridan's."</p>
               <p>The ladies came in, and the General entered into conversation with them in a free
                  and vivacious manner, as if the interests of a vast army, and movements involving
                  the lives of thousands had not, the moment before, engaged his attention. They
                  were all "on the shady side of forty," and one was not a day younger than fifty;
                  but he addressed them throughout the interview as "young ladies." When they had
                  gone, I said to him: "Don't consider me impertinent, but I am curious to know why
                  you called your visitors '<emph>young</emph> ladies.'"</p>
               <p>"Because they <emph>are</emph> young. Any woman who comes a thousand miles to
                  attend on sick and dying men must be young—young of soul—and, no matter how old
                  she grows, she'll <emph>always</emph> be young."</p>
               <p>The letters were written, the two aides had disappeared, and another knot of
                  officers had gathered around the General, when a short, stout, thick-necked man,
                  with puffy cheeks, coarse, heavy features, and very much the air of a Bowery boy
                  rigged out in regimentals, swaggered into the room with his hat on. Giving no heed
                  to the galaxy of generals and major-generals about me, he stalked up to Rosecrans,
                  and said to him: "Can I see you?" They passed to the farther corner of the
                  apartment, and I asked the gentleman nearest me: "Who is he?" "General McCook,"
                  was the answer.</p>
               <p>It was Major-General Alexander McDowell McCook—the "fighting McCook"—who never
                  fought without being beaten, and has probably wasted more lives than any ten
                  generals in the army.</p>
               <p>"Why do you always attack McCook?" I asked Captain Firman, the rebel General
                  Wheeler's aide, a short time afterwards. "Because we are always sure to whip him,"
                  was his reply.</p>
               <p>While the two generals were in conversation, a spare, sallow-faced, dark-haired
                  man, who had the air and manners of a gentleman, entered the room, and bowing to
                  the officers about me, joined the two in the corner. "That is Crittenden," said
                  the officer. "They are here for consultation. We must leave."</p>
               <p>We all passed into General Garfield's apartment, and every chair and stool in the
                  room, and the low camp-cot in the corner, were soon filled with "sitters"—and
                  sitters who would grace any portrait-gallery in the world.</p>
               <p>The reader has heard of every one of them. The stout, full-faced,
                  florid-complexioned man, leaning against the wall by the window, was the "old
                  Russian" Turchin. The very tall, slim young man, with long, dark hair and flowing
                  beard, just then canted back in his chair, with his long legs perched on the
                  window-sill, was the Chief of Cavalry—Stanley. The handsome man next to him, with
                  wavy, brown hair, and face so much like Lowell's, was St. Clair Morton, who might
                  be a poet, and <emph>is</emph> a hero. The scarred warrior on his right, with
                  long, white beard, thin, gray tufts on the sides of his head, and spectacles on
                  his nose, was Van Cleve; and leaning against the wall, at his back, the dark man,
                  with keen, intense eyes, heavy black beard, and coarse, wiry hair, starting up
                  into a sort<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6527-00000105"/> of pyramid on the top of
                  his head, was Jeff. C. Davis, who killed Nelson. The plain, farmer-like,
                  plucky-looking man on my right, was Palmer—now commanding the Fourteenth Corps.
                  The tall man next to him, in rusty uniform and big boots, with a full, clear eye,
                  and expressive face, was Negley; and in other parts of the room were Hazen, Lytle,
                  Reynolds, Harker, King, McKibben, and others, "too numerous to mention."</p>
               <p>Thrusting his pen behind his ear, Garfield wheeled about on his stool, and opened
                  the conversation. It soon turned upon the rebellion, which he compared to the
                  conspiracy of Catiline. It had, he said, the same origin and objects, and was set
                  afoot by a similar class of bankrupt scoundrels. A discussion followed, and in it,
                  Garfield—who, at fifteen, drove horses on a canal, and worked his way through
                  College with a saw and a jackplane—displayed a classical knowledge that would have
                  done credit to any Harvard professor. At its close, a singularly quiet, unassuming
                  man, in plain pants, loose, blue sack, and every-day boots, entered the room, and
                  took a seat on the window-sill, by the side of Stanley. He was below the medium
                  height, slightly built, with closely-cut hair and beard, and a dark, sun-browned
                  face. There was nothing about him to attract attention, except his eye, but that
                  seemed a ball of black flame. "How are you, Phil?" "Good morning, Sherridan,"
                  greeted him from various parts of the room, and Garfield, turning to me, said:
                  "Mr. ——, this is General Sherridan."</p>
               <p>It was the youngest corps commander in the army—the man who, when McCook was
                  routed, stood so like a wall at Stone River; who led the desperate assault on
                  Mission Ridge, and has recently made the brilliant cavalry campaign in
                  Virginia.</p>
               <p>"Do you remember Pope's thirty thousand muskets and ten thousand prisoners?" asked
                  a young officer near me.</p>
               <p>"Yes, very well," I replied.</p>
               <p>"I took the muskets, and Sherridan took the men. How many were there,
                  Sherridan?"</p>
               <p>"I don't remember," answered the quiet general.</p>
               <p>"Well, I remember the muskets; they counted nine hundred and thirty—not one more
                  or less."</p>
               <p>"I was with Pope at the second battle of Booneville," said another general, "when
                  Sherridan rode up and reported sixty-five prisoners. 'Why don't you say five
                  hundred?' said Pope. 'Because there are only sixty-five,' said Sherridan. 'There
                  ought to be five hundred—call them five hundred, any way,' said Pope; and five
                  hundred they were—but not in <emph>Sherridan's</emph> report."</p>
               <p>A general laugh followed, but the quiet hero said nothing, and, in all I saw of
                  him afterwards, I never heard him speak disparagingly of any one.</p>
               <p>"You got through at last, Sir," just then said a voice at my elbow. Turning round,
                  I saw a thin, spare man, with bushy, gray hair, and about the keenest eye I ever
                  saw, looking in at the window. He was dressed in citizen's clothes, and had under
                  his arm a paper box filled with letters.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes," I replied, "I got through. But where have I met you, Sir?"</p>
               <p>"Probably nowhere, but I know you," he replied, smiling; "you see I have to look
                  after suspicious new-comers."</p>
               <p>There was a general laugh at my expense, and Stanley, glancing at the box of
                  letters, said to the civilian:</p>
               <p>"Robbing the mails again, eh, Colonel?"</p>
               <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6527-00000106"/>
               <p>"Yes, bagged two thousand dollars this morning;" and, addressing me, he added:
                  "Some of your New York gift-book and bogus-jewelry concerns, tempt our boys to
                  waste money on their worthless trash. I head them off by watching the mails. I've
                  stopped seventeen thousand dollars within a fortnight—sent it back to the boys
                  with a little good advice, gratis."</p>
               <p>"You deserve the thanks of every soldier's wife and mother in the country," I said
                  warmly.</p>
               <p>But he has not received even <emph>their</emph> thanks, and his great services
                  have had the poorest possible recognition from the Government. It was "Colonel"
                  Truesdail who organized the admirable spy-system of the Cumberland army, which
                  gave Rosecrans such perfect information of the movements of the enemy.</p>
               <p>Just then the inner door opened, and McCook, looking for all the world as if he
                  had the universe on his shoulders, and found it decidedly heavy, passed through
                  the apartment, and soon Rosecrans and Crittenden appeared, and we went in to
                  lunch.</p>
               <p>At Stone River, during the second day's fight, a young cavalry officer rode up to
                  General Thomas for orders. "Report to Morton—at the front," said the General, and
                  shouting to his men, the young man dashed on to where the battle was raging hotly.
                  Morton was not there. On he went again to where Palmer was rolling back the red
                  waves on the left, but—Morton was not there. On again he went, through the thick
                  smoke and the hurtling fire, to where Hazen was reaping a harvest of death on that
                  terrible "half-acre;" but—Morton was not there. "Where is Morton?" he cried. "At
                  the front!" came back from out the smoke, and again he rode on—rode on past the
                  "Burnt House"—past where Rosecrans sat like a statue amid a hailstorm of fire—past
                  where a reeking funeral pile marked the outer line of intrenchments—on to the
                  cannon-ploughed, death-strewn cotton-field! "Is he mad? Call him back! Call him
                  back!" shouted the General, but the bugle was drowned in the awful uproar, and
                  still he rode onward. Amazed the rebel gunners stood at their pieces, but straight
                  at them he rode with his handful of men. "I say, Rebs," he shouted, "where is
                  Morton?" "Gone where you are going," they answered, and the cannon echoed "Gone,"
                  and he went—back again, not a man wounded.</p>
               <p>That young officer—Lieutenant Kelley, 4th U. S. Cavalry—and the men who rode in
                  that terrible ride, escorted us out to Sherridan's.</p>
               <p>As we entered the forest encircling the town, Garfield broke out with Hosea
                  Bigelow's poem: <q>
                     <l>"I du believe in Freedom's cause,"</l>
                  </q> and if the "down-east poet" would have any appreciation of his own lines, he
                  should hear them in some such grand old woods, the words echoed back from the
                  great spreading trees, and set to the music of a hundred horse's heels. He had
                  scarcely ended, when the General began to tell how: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Zekle crep' up, quite unbeknown,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">An' peeked in thru the winder;</l>
                        <l>While there sot Huldy all alone,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">'ith no one nigh to hender."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"What would you give to have written that?" he said, as he finished the
                  recitation.</p>
               <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6527-00000107"/>
               <p>"All the castles I ever built in the clouds," I replied.</p>
               <p>"So would I. You know what Wolfe said before his great battle?"</p>
               <p>"That he would rather have written Gray's Elegy than take Quebec. Would
                     <emph>you</emph> have said that before Stone River?"</p>
               <p>He hesitated a moment, and then answered: "No; for now we need victories more than
                  poems."</p>
               <p>"As I came down, I saw the battle-field—what were your sensations when under fire
                  so constantly all of that day?"</p>
               <p>"I had no sensations. I was absorbed in planning how to beat them."</p>
               <p>Just then an opening in the trees showed us several thousand men under review, in
                  a field off at the left.</p>
               <p>"It is Negley's division. Let us ride over there, General," said Garfield.</p>
               <p>We turned our horses and galloped off through the forest. The underbrush was
                  cleared away, and a rich sward of "blue grass" covered the ground, but every here
                  and there a great tree felled for the fortifications, obstructed our way. One of
                  these trunks—eighty feet long and nearly ten feet thick at the base—lay directly
                  across our path. Garfield and I, who rode on either side of the General, reined
                  our horses around its two ends, and the rest of the party divided and followed us,
                  but Rosecrans spurred "Toby" directly at the trunk, and cleared it at a bound.</p>
               <p>"Well done, General," I shouted; "you fire straight at the mark."</p>
               <p>"It's the surest way to hit it," he replied, smiling.</p>
               <p>Clearing a low fence into a cotton field, we soon "turned" a small hill, and were
                  abreast of the division. As the well-known "gray" came in sight, the soldiers set
                  up a loud shout, and uncovering his head, the General rode down the lines. Halting
                  every now and then he spoke to the men. "You keep yourself tidy, Patrick. You can
                  fight," he said to one. "I kin fight for <emph>ye,</emph> Giniral, be Jabers."
                  "Leave out the hard words, my man. Brave men never swear." Passing before a
                  company of Tennesseans, he said: "You've had mountain air; there's not a pale face
                  among you." "Ye've guv'n us exercise, Gen'ral. Guv us more on it," was the answer.
                  "I'll give you enough—never fear." To a mere boy, he said: "I saw you at Stone
                  River—you fought like a man." "They've made a man of me, sir," said the soldier,
                  pointing to the stripes on his arm. "I saw <emph>ye</emph> thar, Gen'ral," said
                  another. "My old 'ooman prayed fur ye, an' thet's the how ye 'scaped." "Tell her
                  for me, God bless her," said Rosecrans as he rode on.</p>
               <p>And so we went down the lines, the General halting every few minutes to say some
                  free word to the soldiers, and greeted, at every step, with cheers and "God bless
                  yous." That ride showed me why his men worship him.</p>
               <p>As we reined our horses again towards the woods, he said to me: "Do you see that
                  young man yonder?" "That quiet, modest looking Brigadier?" I asked. "Yes. It's
                  Carlin. At Stone River he sat his horse as coolly as he does now."</p>
               <p>At Sherridan's I saw Rosecrans unbent. The bow which is always strung loses its
                  power: so workers, such as he, wear out by constant working. The hour of
                  relaxation is the time to learn any man, and then I tried to study him. Sherridan
                  had invented a game he called "Dutch Ten-Pins." On the lawn in front of his
                  quarters, between two immense elms, he had<pb n="214-215"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000108"/> suspended a long rope, and to the end of it
                  attached a small cannon-ball. On the ground, midway between these trees, was a
                  square board which held the ten-pins. The game lay in throwing the ball so that it
                  would miss the pins in going out, and strike them in coming back. To do this, a
                  peculiar twist had to be given to the rope by bending the wrist, and it seemed
                  almost impossible to avoid hitting the pins on the direct throw. Three "throws"
                  were "a game," and only thirty "strokes" could be made. Sherridan, by much
                  practice, had become expert at the play, and could make, pretty regularly, twenty
                  "strokes," but a novice did well if he made ten. He soon challenged Rosecrans, and
                  the dozen officers with him, to enter the lists. Sherridan opened the play,
                  cleared the board twice, and missed it altogether the third throw. "Twenty," cried
                  the "scorer," and another player took his place. He did indifferently well. Others
                  followed with more or less success, though none came up to Sherridan's
                  "score."</p>
               <p>"Now for the General," shouted "the Major," laughing, as Rosecrans took his place.
                  "He'll score thirty, sure."</p>
               <p>"Don't laugh till <emph>you</emph> win, my boy," answered the General, with his
                  peculiar smile.</p>
               <p>Calculating deliberately the motion of the ball, he let it go. Every pin fell, on
                  the direct throw, and a general laugh followed. Not at all disconcerted, he tried
                  again and again, till he had played three or four "games," with scarcely better
                  success. Amid the mock congratulations of the whole assemblage he at last sat
                  down, and Garfield entered the lists. "It's nothing but mathematics," said
                  Garfield; "you only need an eye and a hand," and carelessly throwing the ball, he
                  cleared the board and scored twenty-three!</p>
               <p>"You can't do that again."</p>
               <p>"I'll try," answered the modest Brigadier, and he did do it, several times in
                  succession.</p>
               <p>"I can do better than <emph>that,</emph>" said Rosecrans, again taking the ball. A
                  shout of derision followed the boast, but he quietly set himself to work, and,
                  half a dozen times in succession, made from twenty-five to thirty "strokes." As he
                  resumed his seat, I said to him:</p>
               <p>"That leap over the tree, and the way you've won this game, have shown me what
                  made you conquer at Stone River."</p>
               <p>"What was it?" he asked, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Directness—firing straight at the mark—and a kind of persistence which makes you
                  hold on till you succeed." And those two qualities, with untiring work, have made
                  him the great man and the great general that he is.</p>
               <p>For hours after dinner, and far into the night, the General was as intensely
                  occupied as during the morning. Despatches were read, letters dictated, orders
                  given, visitors received, and grave questions disposed of, with a celerity that
                  taxed his aides to the utmost, and made the head of a looker-on almost swim with
                  excitement. "Give me young men for work," he said, glancing at "the Major"—his
                  senior aide, Frank S. Bond, of Cincinnati—"these sandy-haired fellows, who can
                  drive a quill like lightning."</p>
               <p>"But they soon wear out," I answered, "and even dark-haired men couldn't long
                  stand the work you give them."</p>
               <p>"Well, they do well while they last, and you know we live in deeds, not
                  years."</p>
               <p>At the battle of luka, an officer of General Ord's staff, seeing a division of
                  rebels about to flank one of our regiments, rode<pb n="216-217"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000109"/> up and informed Rosecrans of the danger. "Ride on
                  and warn Stanley, at once," said the General. An acre on fire, and showered with
                  bullets, lay between them and the menaced troops. The officer looked at it, and
                  said: "General, I have a wife and children."</p>
               <p>"You knew that when you came here," said the General, coolly.</p>
               <p>"I'll go, sir," was the only answer.</p>
               <p>"Stay a moment. We must make sure of this," and hastily writing some despatches,
                  and General called three of his orderlies. Giving a despatch to each, he said to
                  the officer: "Now go." He started, and at intervals of about fifty yards, bearing
                  a similar message, the orderlies followed. The officer ran the fiery gauntlet,
                  and, his clothes pierced with bullets, and his horse reeling from a mortal wound,
                  reached Stanley,—the orderlies found their graves on that acre of fire!</p>
               <p>To that officer, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur C. Ducat, Inspector-General of the
                  Cumberland army, and General Thomas, I was, about midnight of the day I am
                  describing, illustrating the superior advantages of slavery as a bleaching
                  process, when Rosecrans approached, and laying his hand on General Thomas's chair,
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Speaking of white blacks, reminds me of two who came within the lines a few weeks
                  ago. They were as white as I am—a little boy and girl, belonging to 'General'
                  Chambers, a rich planter and a 'strong Union man,' living some twenty miles from
                  here. Chambers called on me the other day, and feeling it my duty to be courteous
                  to 'our friends,' I asked him to dinner. Every moment I expected he would broach
                  the subject of his slaves, but he left without saying a word about them. However
                  ever, he came back in a few days. I invited him again to dinner, and he declined,
                  but said:</p>
               <p>"Gen'ral, some on my property has come inter yer lines. I know'd they was har when
                  I seed yer afore. I was telled ye'd yered they wus my children—ye sees they's as
                  white as I is—an' I felt sort o' delicate like 'bout axin' yer fur 'em till I
                  could show, fur sartin, they wasn't. They is my nevye's—yere's the papers ter
                  prove it."</p>
               <p>"I don't see what difference it makes whether they are <emph>your</emph> children
                  or your nephew's," I answered. "But I suppose you've come to claim them?"</p>
               <p>"That <emph>is</emph> what I'se come for, Gen'ral—I s'pose ye'll guv 'em up?"</p>
               <p>"Of course," I replied; "we are not negro-stealers. Every man shall have his
                  rights within my lines."</p>
               <p>"I am obleeged ter ye—much obleeged ter ye, Gen'ral," he said, showing strong
                  symptoms of hugging me. "I war telled ye wus a blasted ab'lishioner, an' wudn't
                  guv 'em up, an' I'm right glad ye does, fur it'll do a heap uv good; it'll
                  cunciliate the loyal peeple round yere, mightly. Whar is they, Gen'ral?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know—Major Bond can tell you."</p>
               <p>"Won't it 'quire an order frum ye ter git 'em, Gen'ral?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no; you only need to ask them to go—slavery is so benign a thing that even
                  white children must love it."</p>
               <p>"An' karn't I hev 'em 'less they'll go peacerbly," he exclaimed, in
                  consternation.</p>
               <p>"Of course not; you must use no force. We neither steal negroes nor
                     <emph>catch</emph> them."</p>
               <p>"With a big flea in his ear, he left, no doubt cursing me for a 'blasted
                  ab'lishioner.'"</p>
               <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6527-00000110"/>
               <p>To appreciate this action, the reader needs to remember that our Government was
                  then pursuing the "conciliatory policy," and that nearly every department
                  commander was returning fugitives. Rosecrans sent the children North, and, I am
                  told, is now having them educated at his own expense.</p>
               <p>The clock had struck one when I rose, and General Thomas said to me: "Come to my
                  quarters to-morrow; I want to introduce you to one or two of the prominent Union
                  men of the district."</p>
               <p>I remained with Rosecrans nearly a month, and in that period saw much of him,
                  meeting him every day. During all of that time, I saw nothing of the
                  brandy-drinking or opium-eating with which his enemies have charged him—and I
                  should have seen it, had it existed. In all our intercourse, I found him as
                  earnest a patriot, as honest a man, as true and Christian a gentleman as, I think,
                  ever lived; and I should be false to my convictions of right if I omitted to say,
                  that those who, at such a time as this, have been instrumental in burying his
                  great military talents in a mere civil employment, have done immense wrong to the
                  country. It is not our most excellent President who has done this. He, I know,
                  thinks of Rosecrans as I do. Nor was he removed because of the repulse at
                  Chickamauga. The Government has exonerated him from blame in that affair; and
                  those best informed have told me that, had the information on which he acted been
                  correct, we should have lost Tennessee and Kentucky, had he done differently from
                  what he did. Time is said to take its revenges; it also bestows its rewards. It
                  will reward Rosecrans, by placing his name among those of the best and truest men
                  in our history.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">VIEWS OF SOUTHERN MEN.</head>
               <p>AT General Thomas's quarters, on the following day, I met several leading men of
                  the district, who had "suffered the loss of all things" rather than deny the
                  Union. One of them—Colonel Wisner, of the County of Bedford—was the only member of
                  the Tennessee Legislature who, to the very end, voted against the schemes of the
                  secessionists. He had the moral courage, at the time of the June election, to
                  canvass his district in the face of a thousand rebel bayonets. The soldiers often
                  attempted to break up the meetings, but the unarmed people gathered around the
                  stands, kept off the soldiery, and bade him "go on." The result was, a large
                  majority of the votes of his county were cast against "separation." He was ordered
                  away by the Confederate authorities, but refused to go, and only went at last on
                  being taken from his bed by a squad of soldiers. He was bound to a horse—he
                  refused to mount, or to keep mounted—and driven in that plight within our
                  lines.</p>
               <p>He said to me: "The Southern <emph>people</emph> are at heart loyal to liberty.
                  They think they are fighting for it. Disabuse them of the error, and all of them
                  will be Union men. Give me free speech, and in six months I will revolutionize
                  one-half of this State. Bosson will do the other half."</p>
               <p>"But the Emancipation proclamation must stand. Will the masses come cordially back
                  if the blacks are freed?"</p>
               <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6527-00000111"/>
               <p>"They will, unless you attempt to give the slaves suffrage. If you do that, the
                  poor whites will fight until not a man is left. They think themselves
                  superior—they <emph>are</emph> superior to the negroes, and they will never
                  consent to blacks making laws for whites."</p>
               <p>"But the abolitionists," I said, laughing, "have hit upon a plan for bleaching the
                  blacks—making good white men of them."</p>
               <p>"That is absurd. You know the black does not seek the white, but the white the
                  black. Free the negro, give him control of his own person, and amalgamation will
                  totally cease."</p>
               <p>"I think so; and that, to me, is one of the strongest reasons for abolishing
                  slavery. But if the blacks are all emancipated, what state of things will
                  follow?"</p>
               <p>"There would be no change at first. The South needs labor, and the blacks would
                  give it. Gradually the more enterprising and ambitious would emigrate to some new
                  territory, and found a community of their own, like the Mormons. The less
                  enterprising would stay here, and finally die out."</p>
               <p>"Why die out?"</p>
               <p>"Because they cannot compete with the white man.<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_005" xml:id="return_005">*</ref>
                   Remove the odium attached to white labor—abolishing slavery will do it—and
                  you would call out the energies of the poor whites. One of them would earn a
                  dollar, where a negro would earn fifty cents. The consequence would be, poverty
                  and starvation for the negroes; and those that stayed here would in time die
                  out."</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_005">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_005">*</ref>This is a new view for a Southern man. The slaveocracy has always insisted
                     that white labor cannot compete with black, in a hot climate. Observation
                     has satisfied me that the contrary is true. The severest work at the South,
                     ditching and clearing swamp lands, has always been done by whites.</p>
               </note>
               <p>"Some of our wisest statesmen advocate black-suffrage as a means of insuring a
                  Union strength at the South. What do you think of it?"</p>
               <p>"That it would not be a strength, but a weakness. The black are ignorant, docile,
                  and accustomed to being led. Their votes would be controlled by a few demagogues,
                  and all over the South, you would have the state of things you now see in New York
                  city."</p>
               <p>Another of these gentlemen—Mr. Bosson, of White County, who before the war was
                  largely identified with the railway interests of the State, and a prominent actor
                  in its politics, gave me so interesting an account of the rise of the secession
                  movement in Tennessee, that I am tempted to repeat it. His views of the real
                  feeling of the masses, and of what should be done with them and their leaders, are
                  entitled to great respect, for he is largely experienced in public affairs, and
                  thoroughly acquainted with all classes of the Southern people.</p>
               <p>"During the Presidential canvass of 1860," he said, "I clearly saw that the
                  purpose of the Secessionists was to precipitate the South into rebellion. I
                  communicated my impressions to our Bell and Everett elector, and advised him to so
                  conduct the discussion as to arouse the people to the coming issue. The month of
                  November came, and with it the action of the South Carolina Legislature,
                  initiating the Rebellion. Our legislature was then in session, and under the
                  guidance of Governor Harris, and other leading advocates of Southern rights, its
                  proceedings assumed a direction that tended to strengthen the purpose of the
                  Secessionists. When I perceived<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6527-00000112"/> this,
                  with a view to awaken the people, and prepare them for the great issue, I
                  inaugurated a series of meetings in the counties along the mountains. They were
                  largely attended, and the people seemed unanimous for the Union.</p>
               <p>"On the third of January, 1861, the legislature reported and passed a resolution
                  authorizing a vote to be taken in the month of February following. The issue: 'For
                  a Convention or against it,' and, 'For delegates to the Convention.'</p>
               <p>"The election was held, and resulted, throughout the State, in a large majority
                  against a convention, and a still larger majority—65,000—for the Union candidates
                  to the convention. In the county of White—where I resided—out of sixteen hundred
                  votes, the secessionists polled only a hundred and twenty-nine; and there, Judge
                  Gardenhire and Colonel Colms, both popular speakers, took the 'stump,' and spoke
                  for Separation; and hand-bills and circulars, breathing the bad spirit of
                  secession, were widely scattered. The people were rejoiced at the result, and when
                  I announced the vote at our precinct, they unanimously resolved never to support a
                  man for any civil office who that day had voted for a disunion candidate. The
                  Secessionists were rebuked, and, receding from the high ground they had taken,
                  proposed 'Neutrality' as the true policy.</p>
               <p>"Fort Sumter surrendered, and the call for seventy-five thousand men gave
                  encouragement to the leading disunionists. They at once sounded the alarm that the
                  Government meant to <emph>coerce</emph> the South. The Legislature was immediately
                  convened, and on the recommendation of Governor Harris, it resolved to place the
                  forces of the State on a war footing, authorized the raising of volunteers for
                  State defence, and made large appropriations for that purpose. It also matured a
                  plan, and passed a law for an election in the following June, to vote Separation
                  or no Separation,' 'Representation or no Representation.'</p>
               <p>"Then, all over the State, allured by the novelty of the enterprise, the young men
                  responded to the heated declamation of the secession speakers, and with fife and
                  drum, the demagogues accomplished what they could not have done with argument. No
                  speaker of loyal proclivities was allowed to participate in the discussions. At
                  each meeting squads of armed volunteers, with drums beating and flags flying,
                  escorted the speakers and overawed the loyal voters.</p>
               <p>"Election day—the 8th of June—arrived, and threats were widely made that no black
                  republican would be permitted to approach the polls. I regarded the action of the
                  Legislature as contrary to the Constitution, but I resolved to vote. On the
                  morning of the election, with four gentlemen who thought as I did, I went to the
                  precinct. Soldiers were within and around the building, and no Union man had dared
                  to enter; but we quietly elbowed our way through the crowd, wrote our ballots in
                  the sight of the multitude, and gave our votes to the officer. A profound silence
                  prevailed as our votes were read, and when we turned and looked on the secession
                  crew, not a word was spoken, not a gesture made. They were cowed by five honest
                  men! On my return, the meeting with my wife and children was an affecting one.
                  They had not expected to see me again alive.</p>
               <p>"The vote in the State at the February election was 155,000, and the Union
                  majority 65,000. In June, the total vote was only 115,000, and the separation and
                  representation majority<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6527-00000113"/> about 36,000.
                  The vote fell short of the vote in February 40,000.</p>
               <p>"Timidity overcame loyal men, and those disposed to be loyal, and they stayed at
                  home; besides, all were told that if they supported 'No Separation,' they would
                  vote a halter to the necks of their own and their neighbors' sons, who had
                  volunteered. Could we have had free speech, we might have rallied the moral
                  strength of the loyal, and defeated 'Separation;' but our leaders had deserted the
                  Union: Brown, Bell, Ewing, and others were either committed to the rebel
                  enterprise, or alarmed into acquiescence by the merely apparent popularity of the
                  secession movement. The people did not want separation. They were content with
                  their political condition; but, abandoned by their leaders, appealed to by a
                  variety of bad influences, and surrounded by an armed mob—headed by the Governor
                  of the State—they yielded to the sweeping storm. Wherever there was free
                  discussion, the Union was sustained. In Bedford County, where Colonels Wisner and
                  Cooper boldly discussed the question, the people voted against separation. And so
                  it was in that portion of Smith County which was canvassed by Dr. Gordon and W. B.
                  Stokes; and so, if we could have had free speech, would it have been all over the
                  State. The action of East Tennessee proves this.</p>
               <p>"The first Wednesday in August was our Gubernatorial election. The aggregate vote
                  then was 116,000—Harris beating Polk 33,000, and the ballots at this election fell
                  short of February, 39,000 votes.</p>
               <p>"Then I saw the storm that was coming, and remained at my home in White County, to
                  gather up my scattered means, and prepare for the inevitable and terrible future.
                  General Buell reached Nashville in May, 1862. As soon as I heard of it I passed
                  the rebel pickets in the night, to look once more on the glorious flag of my
                  country. I stayed at Nashville till Buell advanced to the Tennessee River, and
                  then returned home, defying the threats of my rebel neighbors. In July, Forrest
                  encamped on my plantation, and there planned the capture of Murfreesboro. He
                  returned there with his prisoners and plunder, cannons, guns, horses and mules,
                  and left his sick at my house. I was known to him and his officers as a Union man,
                  but they treated me with respect. I showed them the commission of my father,
                  signed by John Hancock, and they admitted I could not be false to his principles.
                  I found many Union men in the rebel regiments. They would come to me and say they
                  loved me, because I dared to stand up for the old flag.</p>
               <p>"Forrest took my stock, corn, hay, and oats, and made requisition on me for bread
                  and meat, offering pay in Confederate money. I refused to take it, telling him it
                  was tainted with treason. I then became the object of persecution. My letters had
                  been opened and examined long before; but then I was waited on by a
                  self-constituted committee, who told me they were my friends, and used many
                  arguments to make me a rebel. The South, they said, was sure to come gloriously
                  out of the contest, when Tennessee and the border States would be the New England
                  of the Confederacy, and my large water-power would become immensely valuable. I
                  answered that my loyalty was not in the market, and consequently could not be
                  bought. This exasperated them, and they said I must immediately leave the
                  county—that if I went at once, no personal harm should come to me. I replied, that
                  I should leave when<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6527-00000114"/> convenient—not
                  before; that the property about me was my own—earned by my own industry; but I
                  would abandon it all rather than abandon the Union. Then they told me that they
                  would not be responsible for my personal safety, and left—I telling them, as they
                  went away, that though my hair was gray, I could defend myself.<ref rend="super"

               <p>"Rebel soldiers, in citizens' clothes, then waylaid and attempted to shoot me,
                  and, at last, yielding to the entreaties of my wife, I fled at night, and joined
                  our good General (Thomas, who was then present) at McMinnville. I went with him to
                  Nashville, and remained there till after the battle of Stone River, when I joined
                  him again at Murfreesboro. My wife said to me, when I left her: 'I have nothing to
                  give to the Union but you. I give <emph>you,</emph> and God will accept the
                  sacrifice' (and here the cool, collected man paused, and while every one was
                  silent, wept). She and the children are still within the Rebel lines. My
                  plantation and mills are occupied by rebel soldiers, and I have turned my back
                  upon a home that, before the rebellion, was one of peace and plenty—and I say to
                  you, Sir, the rebels are more wicked, more malicious, and more dangerous than any
                  foreign enemy could be. We must exterminate the leaders wholly. The poor, simple
                  people have been misled: and, mortified and humiliated, theywould, the most of
                  them, now come back to their allegiance, and become again good citizens. We must
                  deal with them gently, but the leaders—every man who has taken a prominent part in
                  promoting the rebellion—must be expatriated—placed where he can no longer deceive
                  the people. The <emph>people</emph> of Tennessee never desired the destruction of
                  the National Government. They did not appreciate its blessings till they lost
                  them; but now, in mortification and astonishment, they have awakened to its
                  blessings, and see the ruin they have caused. Remove the leaders, and the masses
                  will joyfully return to obedience. I hold the perpetuation of the Union above all
                  other considerations. I have sacrificed every thing for it, and I have no ill-will
                  against those who would destroy it, but I counsel the removal of every impediment
                  that stands in the way of re-establishing its power and authority. It cannot be
                  expected that all the Union men in the slave States will approve of the
                  destruction of slavery—but the number who will not is small. It <emph>must
                     be</emph> destroyed.</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> say, if slavery, property, or persons stand in the way of
                  restoring the Union, remove them all. Save the life of the Nation. Preserve that,
                  whatever else is lost.</p>
               <p>"To a careful observer, who has resided long in the South, the truth is apparent
                  that slavery has moulded all its manners, customs, and interests, its social,
                  moral, and religious institutions. Our people are not a reading people; few books
                  or newspapers are seen among them, and their educational interests have been
                  shamefully neglected; therefore, the non-slaveholders have yielded a ready
                  obedience to the slaveholders, who have controlled all legislative action. They
                  have controlled every thing, and therefore we must crush them. Crush
                     <emph>them</emph> as well as slavery, for until we do that, we can have no
                  lasting peace."</p>
               <p>These are the words of a loyal Southerner. I have met many of them, but I never
                  met one who did not feel and talk as he did. <emph>They</emph> advocate no halfway
                  measures: they would<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6527-00000115"/> strike at the root
                  of the tree. They know that this is a life and death struggle between two great
                  principles; between Democracy and Aristocracy; between a Republic and a Despotism;
                  and that one or the other must perish. Would to God that the loyal men of the
                  North realized this as they do. If they did, Copperheads and peace-men would now
                  be things of history.</p>

               <p>I PASSED, as I have said, several weeks at Murfreesboro, and I could fill a volume
                  with what I saw and heard, but the fear of compromising public interests holds my
                  pen. Some day, when "this cruel war is over," I may be at liberty to write what I
                  know. Then, if not before, the American people will say to Rosecrans: "Well done,
                  good and faithful servant."</p>
               <p>But now, when the rebels are raising the black flag, and butchering our troops,
                  black and white, in a spirit unknown to even savage warfare, there is one thing
                  which should be told.</p>
               <p>One day, as I was sitting alone with Rosecrans, an aide handed him a letter. He
                  opened it, ceased doing half a dozen other things, and became at once absorbed in
                  its contents. He re-read it, and then, handing it to me, said: "Read that. Tell me
                  what you think of it." I read it. Its outside indicated it had come from "over
                  Jordan," and had "a hard road to travel," but its inside startled me. It was
                  written in a round, unpractised hand, and though badly spelled, showed its author
                  familiar with good <emph>Southern</emph> English. Its date was May 18th, 1863, and
                  it began thus:</p>
               <p>"GENERAL:—A plan has been adopted for a simultaneous movement or rising to sever
                  the rebel communications throughout<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6527-00000116"/> out
                  the whole South, which is now disclosed to some general in each military
                  department in the Secesh States, in order that they may act in concert, and thus
                  insure us success.</p>
               <p>"The plan is for the blacks to make a concerted and simultaneous rising, on the
                  night of the first of August next, over the whole States in rebellion. To arm
                  themselves with any and every kind of weapon that may come to hand, and commence
                  operations by burning all railroad and county bridges, tearing up all railroad
                  tracks, and cutting and destroying telegraph wires—and when this is done take to
                  the woods, the swamps, or the mountains, whence they may emerge, as occasions may
                  offer, for provisions or for further depredations. No blood is to be shed except
                  in self-defence.</p>
               <p>"The corn will be in roasting ear about the first of August, and upon this, and by
                  foraging on the farms at night, we can subsist. Concerted movement at the time
                  named would be successful, and the rebellion be brought suddenly to an end."</p>
               <p>The letter went on with some details which I cannot repeat, and ended thus:</p>
               <p>"The plan will be simultaneous over the whole South, and yet few of all engaged
                  will know its whole extent. Please write '1' and 'approved,' and send by the
                  bearer, that we may know <emph>you are with us.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Be assured, General, that a copy of this letter has been sent to every military
                  department in the rebel States, that the time of the movement may thus be general
                  over the entire South."</p>
               <p>I was re-reading the letter when the General again said: "What do you think of
                  it?"</p>
               <p>"It would end the rebellion. It taps the great negro organization, of which I
                  speak in 'Among the Pines,' and, cooperated operated with by our forces, would
                  certainly succeed, but—the South would run with blood."</p>
               <p>"Innocent blood! Women and children!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, women and children. If you let the blacks loose, they will rush into carnage
                  like horses into a burning barn. St. Domingo will be multiplied by a million."</p>
               <p>"But he says no blood is to be shed except in self-defence."</p>
               <p>"He says so, and the leaders may mean so, but they cannot restrain the rabble.
                  Every slave has some real or fancied wrong, and he would take such a time to
                  avenge it."</p>
               <p>"Well, I must talk with Garfield. Come, go with me."</p>
               <p>We crossed the street to Garfield's lodgings, and found him bolstered up in bed,
                  quite sick of a fever. The General sat down at the foot of his bed, and handed him
                  the letter. Garfield read it over carefully, and then laying it down, said:</p>
               <p>"It will never do, General. <emph>We</emph> don't want to whip by such means. If
                  the slaves, of their own accord, rise and assert their original right to
                  themselves, that will be their own affair; but we can have no complicity with them
                  without outraging the moral sense of the civilized world."</p>
               <p>"I knew you'd say so; but he speaks of other department commanders—may they not
                  come into it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, they may, and that should be looked to. Send this letter to ——, and let him
                  head off 'the movement.'"</p>
               <p>It was not thought prudent to intrust the letter to the mails; nor with the
                  railway, infested with guerillas, was it a safe document to carry about the
                  person. A short shrift and a long rope might have been the consequence of its
                  being found on a traveller. So, ripping open the top of my boot, I stowed it
                  snugly away in the lining, and took it North. On<pb n="232-233"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000117"/> the 4th of June following, Garfield wrote me that
                  he had just heard from the writer of the letter; that five out of our nine
                  department commanders had come into the project, and, subsequently, that another
                  general had also promised it his support.</p>
               <p>But I can say no more. All the world knows that the insurrection did not take
                  place. The outbreaks in September, among the blacks of Georgia and Alabama, were
                  only parts of the plan, the work of subordinate leaders, who, maddened at the
                  miscarriage of the grand scheme, determined to carry out their own share of the
                  programme at all hazards. It was a gigantic project, and the trains were all laid,
                  the matches all lighted, and two centuries of cruel wrong were about to be avenged
                  in a night, when a white man said to the negro: "You will slaughter friends and
                  enemies. You will wade knee deep in innocent blood; God cannot be with you in
                  midnight massacre!" A white man said that, and the uplifted torch fell from the
                  negro's hand; and saying: "I will 'bide my time; I will leave vengeance to God,"
                  he went back to his toil and his stripes.</p>
               <p>The time has not come to write the history of this, and I have said what I have,
                  only to show that while Southern men were starving our prisoners, butchering our
                  wounded, and desecrating our dead, we were supplicating the destroying angel to
                  pass over their homes, and save their wives and little ones from a swift
                  destruction. In the day when "He maketh inquisition for blood," on whose garments,
                  my Southern brother, think you, will He find the stain?</p>
               <p>When I parted with Rosecrans, he took my hand and said to me: "Good-by, my friend.

               <p>ONE morning, not many days after the events recorded in the last chapter, General
                  Rosecrans handed me another letter, saying, as he did so, "Here is an application
                  from one of my officers for a furlough. It explains itself. I have to be at the
                  front all day, and I wish you would stay and see him. If you think well of it, I
                  will telegraph the Department for the furlough. The Colonel was a prominent member
                  of the Western Methodist Church, and, though a clergyman, is one of my best and
                  bravest officers. You will be glad of his acquaintance."</p>
               <p>I cheerfully assented to the request, and an orderly was at once dispatched to his
                  camp for the officer. Meanwhile, I read the application. It was as follows:</p>

                           <p>"GENERAL:—I feel it to be my duty to lay before you the following
                              facts, considerations, and proposition:</p>
                           <p>"Situated as we are, it is no matter of astonishment that the great
                              eye of the world is intently fixed upon us. The truth is, we are
                              intrusted with the dearest interests of humanity, with the solution of
                              the grandest problem that ever inspired the hopes or engaged the
                              attention of man. It is the problem of his capacity for
                              self-government. And, if we fail, which we shall do most signally if
                              we do not suppress this rebellion,<pb n="234-235"
                                 xml:id="VAC6527-00000118"/> man's emancipation from tyranny and
                              oppression, and human liberty and self-government, are failures.</p>
                           <p>"The question that Heaven has called us to decide in blood, with the
                              weapons of war, and amid the slaughter of the battle-field, is not one
                              of a political character only. It is not simply a question of latitude
                              and longitude; it is, whether we are a Christian or a heathen
                              people.</p>
                           <p>"On both sides of Mason and Dixon's line we claim to be Christian men.
                              We speak the same language, read the same Bible, and worship God with
                              the same forms and ceremonies. We appoint days of fasting and prayer,
                              and observe them with a zeal worthy of a Christian people, and,
                              independently of man's design, these appointments often fall on the
                              same days, North and South. Resolving to 'trust in God, but keep our
                              powder dry,' we have risen up from our devotions, grasped again the
                              weapons of death, and rushed into the thickest of the fight, without
                              stopping to reflect that God has other means than the sword to subdue
                              his enemies.</p>
                           <p>"It is well known, that before the Southern States seceded, the
                              Methodist Church in the United States was separated on the very
                              questions which have since divided the nation. It is also known that
                              'the Methodist Episcopal Church, South,' was a leading element in the
                              rebellion, and has been a prominent power in the prosecution of the
                              war.</p>
                           <p>"A considerable part of the territory occupied by 'the Methodist
                              Episcopal Church, South,' at the time of the separation, and up to a
                              recent date, is now in possession of our armies. This has brought a
                              large number of the ministers and people of that communion within our
                              lines. Some of these persons were prominent in the movement that
                              separated the Church, and were most bitter and uncompromising on the
                              questions of difference.</p>
                           <p>"From these persons I have learned personally the following facts,
                              viz.: That they consider the rebellion has destroyed the 'Methodist
                              Church, South;' that it has virtually abolished slavery, and
                              obliterated the other prominent questions of difference; that they are
                              sincerely desirous of returning to the 'Old Church;' and that their
                              brethren within the rebel lines are most heartily tired of the
                              rebellion, and most ardently desire peace and the privilege of
                              returning to their allegiance to Church and State, and will do so
                              whenever they are assuredof amnesty for the past.</p>
                           <p>"My attention has been called to these facts, and to others of a like
                              character, frequently of late; and from these considerations—though
                              not from these only, but because God has laid the duty upon me—I would
                              submit to the proper authorities the following proposition, viz.:
                                 <emph>To go into the Southern Confederacy, and return within ninety
                                 days, with proposals of peace that will be acceptable to our
                                 Government.</emph>
                           </p>
                           <p>"I shall propose <emph>no compromise</emph> with traitors, but their
                              immediate return to their allegiance to God and their country. It is
                              no part of my business to discuss the probability or the possibility
                              of my accomplishing this work. I propose to do it in the name of the
                              Lord, and to leave results with Him.</p>
                           <p>"If He puts it into the hearts of my superiors to allow me to go, I
                              shall be thankful; if not, I have discharged my duty.</p>

               <p>A little more than an hour after the departure of the orderly, an erect, spare
                  man, in the undress uniform of a colonel of infantry, entered the inner room of
                  the General's quarters, where I was seated. He seemed rather more than forty, and
                  was a little above the medium height, with gray hair and beard, a high, broad,
                  open forehead, and a thin, marked face, expressing great earnestness, strength,
                  and benignity of character. He came directly up to me, and, bowing rather stiffly,
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Is this Mr. Kirke?"</p>
               <p>"That is a name I sometimes go by. You are Colonel Jaquess. I am very glad to meet
                  you," and I took his hand very cordially.</p>
               <p>"I am very glad to meet you," he replied, taking my hand, and the stiffness
                  disappearing from his manner; "I feel that I know you. My little boy, only this
                  morning, was speaking of you. We were riding through a piece of woods, when he
                  said to me: 'Father, don't this remind you of "Among the Pines?"' He has the story
                  all by heart."</p>
               <p>Was not that fame? To be talked of by a Western boy in the wilds of Tennessee!
                  Reader, I have my "weaknesses," as well as yourself. One of them was touched
                  then—I confess it. The Colonel must have observed it, when I replied:</p>
               <p>"You gratify me. And you've brought your little boy out here to see the South as
                  it is?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, to see the reality of slavery. I want him to hate it as I do. But the
                  General has sent me word he has referred my application to you."</p>
               <p>"He has asked me to hear what you have to say, and you know he is very busy."</p>
               <p>He then explained at some length, the objects he had in view in his proposed visit
                  among the Rebels. He had been, it appeared, for many years a prominent clergyman
                  of the Western Methodist Church, and in friendly and familiar intercourse with the
                  leading divines of that communion in the South. He was a member of the Nashville
                  Convention, which divided that denomination into the "Church North" and the
                  "Church South," and there did all in his power to defeat that unfortunate measure,
                  which, undoubtedly, was the entering-wedge that rent the Union. On the breaking
                  out of the war, he resigned the Presidency of Quincy College—leaving home, ease,
                  and honors—to accept the chaplaincy of the Sixth Illinois Cavalry. After the
                  battle of Pittsburg Landing, for brilliant services in that engagement—this is not
                  his own account of himself—he was solicited by Governor Yates to raise and take
                  command of a regiment. After repeated and urgent entreaty from the Governor, he
                  consented to do so, and the result was, that within three weeks the Seventy-third
                  Illinois Volunteers, known as the "Preachers' Regiment"—nearly every officer in it
                  being a clergyman—was in the field. With this regiment he had served throughout
                  the campaigns in Kentucky and Tennessee, and during that service had met many of
                  his most active and zealous opponents in the Nashville Convention. Without
                  exception, they all had told him they regarded slavery—the sole cause of their
                  schism—as virtually abolished, and had expressed a wish to come back to the Church
                  and the Union. Through them he had corresponded with a number of leading divines
                  within the rebel lines, and they, too, had said they desired to return to their
                  allegiance to the Church and the country. He thought the Methodist people of the
                  South sympathized in this with their leaders, and he added:</p>
               <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6527-00000120"/>
               <p>"I want to go to them—to offer them the olive-branch—to tell them, in the name of
                  God and the country, that they will be welcome back."</p>
               <p>"The Methodist element, I know, Colonel," I replied, "is a strong element at the
                  South; but I fear the peace part of it is not strong enough to control the
                  politicians. They, if I know them, care little about church or country. They have
                  other views than submission. They mean to establish an independent government,
                     <emph>at all hazards.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I don't know what their views are. It is not my business to ask. I feel that God
                  has laid upon me the duty to go to them, and go I must, unless my superiors forbid
                  it."</p>
               <p>"But how will you go? The Government, I feel sure, will give you neither authority
                  nor protection. How, then, will you go?"</p>
               <p>"Openly; in my uniform; as the messenger of God."</p>
               <p>"I fear the rebels, like the people of old, will not recognize you as the Lord's
                  messenger. They'll shoot or hang you as a spy."</p>
               <p>"It is not for me to ask what they will do; I have only to go."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll report what you say to the General, but I must be frank with you: if
                  he asks my opinion, I shall advise him not to apply for the furlough. I have heard
                  of you before, and your life, in my judgment, is altogether too valuable to be
                  wasted on such an embassy."</p>
               <p>"That is not for you to judge. But I want more than a furlough; I want an
                  interview with Mr. Lincoln, to learn the terms on which he will give amnesty to
                  the Rebels. You will say this to the General?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and, as I told you, advise him to do nothing about it."</p>
               <p>At this the Colonel laughed, good-humoredly.</p>
               <p>"What amuses you?" I asked, a little annoyed.</p>
               <p>"I was only thinking how little we know what we will do-Now, I shall not only go,
                  but <emph>you</emph> will help me."</p>
               <p>"How do you know that?"</p>
               <p>"You'll think me superstitious if I tell you."</p>
               <p>"Not till I hear you."</p>
               <p>"Well; when I called on General Garfield, yesterday, and opened my project to him,
                  he told me to put it in black and white, and he would submit it to the General. I
                  went back to camp, and did so—wrote the letter you have in your hand. I had
                  thought of this for several months, but, until I spoke to General Garfield, had
                  said nothing to any one about it. This morning, however, just after sunrise, it
                  occurred to me to talk it over with my Chaplain, who is my intimate friend. Taking
                  the letter with me, I went to his tent. He was just coming out of it; and he said,
                  as he saw me:</p>
               <p>"'Ah, Colonel, I was about to go and see you. I had a strange dream about you last
                  night.'</p>
               <p>"'Did you? What was it?'</p>
               <p>"'I dreamed that you were in a small room with Jeff. Davis and two other
                  gentlemen. I couldn't hear what was said, but you all seemed in very earnest
                  conversation. What did it mean?'</p>
               <p>"I then told him of my intention to visit Mr. Davis, and read him my letter. We
                  both thought it very singular. About an hour afterwards, as we were riding in the
                  woods, my little son mentioned your name. At once it occurred to me that you were
                  here—I did not <emph>know</emph> you were—and here to help me. Now, I have no
                  faith in dreams—I believe God has 'sealed up the vision and the prophecy,' but the
                  impression is strong upon me—stronger than my reason, I cannot shake it off—that I
                  shall see Jeff. Davis, and <emph>you</emph> will help me."</p>

               <p>"Well, I <emph>may.</emph> As you say, we cannot tell what we may do."</p>
               <p>I kept my word with him; that is, I reported the interview to General Rosecrans,
                  and recommended that he should do nothing about it.</p>
               <p>"Why not?" asked the General.</p>
               <p>"Because he could accomplish nothing, and would throw his life away."</p>
               <p>"I know, if he talks peace to the people the leaders will hang him; but he'll not
                  do that. He'll go to the leaders themselves. The terms he will offer may not be
                  accepted, but it will strengthen our moral position to offer them. It will show
                  the world that we do not seek to subjugate the South. As to his life—he takes the
                  right view about that. He considers it already given to the country. If you had
                  seen him at Stone River, you'd think so. He is a hero—John Brown and the Chevalier
                  Bayard rolled into one, and polished up with common sense and a knowledge of
                  Greek, Latin, and the mathematics."</p>
               <p>That evening the General sent a telegram to Washington, stating the Colonel's
                  objects, and asking for him a four months' furlough, and an interview with the
                  President. Answer came in the morning, declining the requests, but asking a fuller
                  explanation of Colonel Jaquess's purposes, by mail. The message was sent out to
                  the Colonel's camp, and in a few hours he appeared at head-quarters. I happened to
                  be with the General at the time. He was as busy as usual, but, as Jaquess came in,
                  looked up, and said:</p>
               <p>"Well, Colonel, you've got your sentence."</p>
               <p>"I don't think so, General. I never give up with one trial."</p>
               <p>"That's right; but what's to be done now?"</p>
               <p>"Try again. Mr. —— must go to Washington. I've known Mr. Lincoln twenty years, but
                  I might write him forty letters, and accomplish nothing. Writing won't do it. Mr.
                  —— must go."</p>
               <p>This was spoken with such inimitable coolness, that I burst into a hearty
                  laugh.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the General, also laughing; "that's it. You must go. You've been
                  talking of going every day for a week—now you must go, and take Washington on your
                  way. I've some other business I want attended to; and you will do it—to oblige
                  me."</p>
               <p>"Well, to oblige you, I will." And thus so much of the Colonel's presentiments
                  were realized. About the rest, the reader will learn before this book is
                  ended.</p>
               <p>I was to start the next afternoon, and in the morning Jaquess came into town to
                  bid me good-by. As we parted, he took my hand, and said to me:</p>
               <p>"I know I shall go on this mission, but whether I shall return or not, is
                  uncertain. But if I do not—if I go to the other side of Jordan before you, be sure
                  I shall be the first man to take you by the hand when you get there."</p>
               <p>This sentence displays the whole character of the man. He "walks by faith, not by
                  sight." To him the curtain which hides the other life from ours is already
                  lifted—the two worlds are already one.</p>
               <p>A few days thereafter, with a bundle of "dispatches" in my pocket, I landed in
                  Washington. Among these "dispatches" was one, of which the following is a
                  copy:</p>

                           <p>"The Rev. Dr. Jaquess, Colonel commanding the 73d Illinois—a man of
                              character—has submitted to me a letter proposing a personal mission to
                              the South. After maturely weighing his plan, and considering well his
                              character, I am decidedly of opinion that the public interests will be
                              promoted by permitting him to go as he proposes.</p>
                           <p>"I do not anticipate the results that he seems to expect, but believe
                              that a moral force will be generated by his mission, that will more
                              than compensate us for his temporary absence from his regiment.</p>
                           <p>"His letter is herein enclosed, and the bearer of this, Mr. ——, can

               <p>Enclosing this and the other papers in an envelope, I sent them, with a note,
                  asking when I could have a private interview with the President, to the White
                  House.</p>
               <p>"Come at half-past seven this evening, and I'll be glad to see you," was the
                  answer.</p>
               <p>I went at the appointed time, and my friend, Mr. Nicolay, said to me:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Lincoln is expecting you, but, just now, he's engaged with Reverdy Johnson.
                  Take a seat in my room, and he'll call you when he's ready."</p>
               <p>I did as I was bidden, and in about half an hour, the homely, humane face, with
                  which everybody is familiar, looked in at the door, and a kind, benevolent voice
                  said to me: "Sorry to have kept you waiting. Come in. Do you know, I can't talk
                  with you about that Jaquess matter?"</p>
               <p>"Why not, Sir?" I asked, following him into the room.</p>
               <p>"Because I happen to be President of the United States. We can make no overtures
                  to the Rebels. If they want peace, all they have to do is to lay down their arms.
                  But never mind about that; you've been to Tennessee, and I want to see you. So sit
                  down, and tell me all you know—it won't take you long."</p>
               <p>It did take me three whole hours; and, while I told it, I took advantage of my
                  position as one of the "sovereigns," to find a little fault with the War
                  Department. Mr. Lincoln heard me patiently, parrying my thrusts with a smile or a
                  humorous story, and, when I concluded, said: "Well, it's lucky that you're 'one of
                  the people.' You escape all this."</p>
               <p>"I know I do; and that reminds me—I received a letter this morning, which I want
                  to read to you. It's from a young woman you've heard of. Long ago she gave herself
                  to the Lord, and that, you know, means the country; so, she's a right to
                  speak."</p>
               <p>Then I read the letter. It was as follows:</p>
               <p>"You write that you are going to Washington, so, I know you'll see 'Old Abe.' Now,
                  don't <emph>you</emph> find any fault with him. I know your impatient
                  disposition—I know you think he ought to have done a good deal more than he has
                  done. But, remember, that he has had an untried way, difficulties all about him,
                  conservatives advising one thing, radicals another, and all deceiving him. So,
                  don't <emph>you</emph> find fault with him, but bid him 'God speed.' Tell him that
                  all good men and women, everywhere<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6527-00000123"/>
                  where, are with him—that they pray for him, and bless him for what he has done,
                  and will yet do. One word, from a man he knows has nothing to ask for, may cheer
                  him—cheer him more than you know—and don't you fail to say it. As you love truth
                  and God, say it, for it is true, and you <emph>ought</emph> to say it."</p>
               <p>It would not be true if I said there was "a tear in his eye" when I read this.
                  There was not. He is not "given to weeping," but his voice had a mellower, softer
                  tone, as he asked:</p>
               <p>"Who is she?"</p>
               <p>I told him.</p>
               <p>"Tell her," he said, "that I thank her—that I hope God will bless her."</p>
               <p>That was a year ago; but what that young woman then said might as well—might
                  better—be said now by every man and woman in the country.</p>
               <p>As I rose to go, he asked me:</p>
               <p>"When do you go home?"</p>
               <p>"In the morning."</p>
               <p>"Can't you stay another day, and come to see me to-morrow evening? I want to think
                  more of that Jaquess matter."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir, I'll do so," and on the following evening I called on him again.</p>
               <p>Grant had then "watered his horse in the Mississippi." Vicksburg was beleaguered,
                  but Pendleton was inside of it with twenty-five thousand men, and Johnston outside
                  of it with thirty thousand. Grant had only thirty thousand. Re-enforcements had
                  not then reached him. Might he not be crushed before they arrived?</p>
               <p>The President was very anxious. He showed none of his usual humor and vivacity.
                  Dispatch after dispatch came in from the War Department, and he opened them,
                  glanced at their signatures, and then, laying them down unread, said: "Only from
                  Hooker;" or, "Only from Burnside;" or, "Only from Rosecrans. Nothing from Grant
                  yet! Why don't we hear from Grant?"</p>
               <p>If the life of his own son had been quivering in the balance at Vicksburg, he
                  could not have shown more anxiety. I had not voted for him. I had not admired or
                  even supported him; but that night I regretted that I had not, for what I saw
                  satisfied me that there is not a drop in Abraham Lincoln's veins that does not
                  beat for his country.</p>
               <p>It was hard to get him to the subject, but at last I did do it; and then he told
                  me, in a clear, direct way, the terms he would give the Rebels. A portion of these
                  terms have since been included in the Amnesty Proclamation; the rest I do not feel
                  at liberty to make public. They are all, however, embodied in a few of his
                  words:</p>
               <p>"The country will do every thing for safety—nothing for revenge."</p>
               <p>If Washington ever uttered a grander, or a nobler sentence than that, I have not
                  read it.</p>
               <p>Finally, he said:</p>
               <p>"You can write what I say to General Rosecrans, and he can communicate as much of
                  it as he thinks best to Colonel Jaquess; but the Colonel must not understand that
                  he has these terms from me. We want peace, but we can make no overtures to the
                  Rebels. They already know that the country would welcome them back, and treat them
                  generously and magnanimously."</p>
               <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6527-00000124"/>
               <p>It was nearly twelve o'clock when I rose to go. As I did so, he said:</p>
               <p>"Don't go yet. I shall stay here until I get something from Grant!"</p>
               <p>The next morning I wrote to Rosecrans, and, within ten days, Colonel Jaquess
                  started for the South. At Baltimore he reported to General Schenck, who forwarded
                  him on to Fortress Monroe. Arriving there he explained his business to General
                  Dix, and he, after much delay, allowed him to smuggle himself on board a
                  flag-of-truce boat going to the Rebel lines. He was in his uniform, but the Rebel
                  officer who met our flag said to him:</p>
               <p>"Go where you please, and stay as long as you like."</p>
               <p>Any one can see the great risk he ran. He had no credentials; nothing to show who
                  he was, or why he came; and there were ten chances to one that he would be taken
                  as a spy. But what was that to him? He was about his MASTER'S work, and his trust
                  in the MASTER, which "whoever runs may read" in his face, carried him safely
                  through.</p>
               <p>He went to Petersburg, and there they came to him. As Nicodemus came to the great
                  PEACE-MAKER, so the Rebel leaders came to him, by night. Disguised, and under
                  false names, they sought him to ask the way to peace.</p>
               <p>"Lay down your arms; go back to your allegiance, and the country will deal kindly
                  and generously by you," he said to all of them.</p>
               <p>From all he had the same answer:</p>
               <p>"We are tired of the war. We are willing to give up slavery. We know it is gone;
                  but so long as our Government holds out, we must stand by it. We cannot betray it
                  and each other."</p>
               <p>And this is <emph>now</emph> the sentiment of the Southern people, and of a vast
                  number of the Southern leaders.</p>
               <p>He remained at Petersburg several weeks and then returned to Baltimore. From there
                  he wrote to the President, but received no answer. He waited there a long time;
                  but, no answer coming, finally returned to his regiment. Then he wrote me, stating
                  the result of his visit, and saying he wanted to go again, with liberty to see
                  Jeff. Davis. [Other leaders he had seen, but Davis he had not seen.] This letter
                  came just as I was setting out on a long journey; and, naturally concluding that
                  if he had not answered Jaquess, he would not answer me, I did not write to the
                  President. Thus the affair rested till I returned from my journey. Then I went to
                  Washington, and, calling on Mr. Lincoln, asked him why he had not answered
                  Jaquess.</p>
               <p>"I never received his letter," was the unexpected reply.</p>
               <p>"Well, it's not too late. Those people are ripe for peace now. I know that from
                  many of them. Let Jaquess go again. There is no telling what he may
                  accomplish."</p>
               <p>The President turned about on his chair, and on a small card wrote the
                  following:</p>

               <p>In a few weeks Jaquess joined me in Baltimore. Going with him to Washington, I
                  then learned that unexpected obstacles were in the way of his further progress.
                  These obstacles could be removed by my accompanying him, and that and other
                  reasons finally led to our visiting Richmond together.</p>

               <head type="sub">WHY I WENT TO RICHMOND.</head>
               <p>I HAVE, in the preceding chapter, related the fact of Colonel Jaquess' first visit
                  within the Rebel lines, and the circumstances which led to his setting out on a
                  second journey thither; and the reader may now ask why I, a "civil" individual,
                  not in the pay of Government, and having no sort of influence in "the Methodist
                  Church South," accompanied him on this second expedition, and, at a season when
                  all the world was rushing North to the mountains and the watering-places,
                  journeyed South for a conference with the arch-Rebel, in the hot and dangerous
                  latitude of Virginia.</p>
               <p>I could give half a dozen good reasons for undertaking such a journey, and any one
                  of them would prove that I am a sensible man, altogether too sensible to go on so
                  long a trip, in the heat of midsummer, for the mere pleasure of the thing; but I
                  will content myself with enumerating a smaller number, and the reader may believe
                  that any one, or all of them, had a greater or a less influence, or no influence
                  at all, in determining my movements.</p>
               <p>First: Very many honest people at the North sincerely believe that the revolted
                  States will return to the Union if assured of protection to their peculiar
                  institution. The Government having declared that no State shall be readmitted
                  which has not first abolished slavery, these people hold <emph>it</emph>
                  responsible for the continuance of the war. It is, therefore, important to know
                  whether the Rebel States will, or will not, return to their allegiance, if allowed
                  to retain Slavery. Mr. Jefferson Davis could, undoubtedly, answer that question;
                  and that may have seemed a reason why I should go to see him.</p>
               <p>Second: On the second of July last, C. C. Clay, of Alabama; J. P. Holcombe, of
                  Virginia; and G. N. Sanders, of nowhere in particular, appeared at Niagara Falls,
                  and publicly announced that they were there to confer with the Democratic leaders
                  in reference to the Chicago nomination. Very soon thereafter, a few friends of the
                  Administration received intimations from those gentlemen that they were
                  Commissioners from the Rebel Government, with authority to negotiate preliminaries
                  of peace on something like the following basis, namely: A restoration of the Union
                  as it was; all negroes actually freed by the war to be declared free, and all
                  negroes not actually freed by the war to be declared slaves.</p>
               <p>These overtures were not considered sincere. They seemed concocted to embarrass
                  the Government, to throw upon it the odium of continuing the war, and thus to
                  secure the triumph of the peace-traitors at the November election. The scheme, if
                  well managed, threatened to be dangerous, by uniting the Peace-men, the
                  Copperheads, and such of the Republicans as love peace better than principle, in
                  one opposition, willing to make peace on terms inconsistent with the interests and
                  safety of the nation. It seemed, therefore, important to discover—what was then in
                  doubt—whether the Rebel envoys really had, or had not, any official authority.</p>
               <p>Within fifteen days of the appearance of these "Peace Commissioners," Jefferson
                  Davis had said to an eminent Secession<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6527-00000126"/>
                  divine, who, late in June, came through the Union lines by the Maryland back-door,
                  that he would make peace on no other terms than a recognition of Southern
                  Independence. (He might, however, agree to two governments, bound together by a
                  league offensive and defensive—for all external purposes, <emph>one;</emph> for
                  all internal purposes, <emph>two;</emph> but he would agree to nothing
                  better.)</p>
               <p>There was reason to consider this information trustworthy, and to believe Mr.
                  Davis altogether ignorant of the doings of his Niagara satellites. If this were
                  true, and were proven to be true—if the <emph>great</emph> Rebel should reiterate
                  this declaration in the presence of a trustworthy witness, at the very time when
                  the <emph>small</emph> Rebels were opening their Quaker guns on the country—would
                  not the Niagara negotiators be stripped of their false colors, and their low
                  schemes be exposed to the scorn of all honest men, North and South?</p>
               <p>I may have thought so; and, if I did, that may have seemed another good reason why
                  I should go to Richmond.</p>
               <p>Third And this, to very many, may appear as potent as any of the preceding
                  reasons:—I had in my boyhood a strange fancy for church-belfries and
                  liberty-poles. This fancy led me, in school-vacations, to perch my small self for
                  hours on the crossbeams in the old belfry, and to climb to the very top of the
                  tall pole which still surmounts the little village green. In my youth, this
                  feeling was simply a spirit of adventure; but as I grew older it deepened into a
                  reverence for what those old bells said, and a love for the principle of which
                  that old liberty-pole is now only a crumbling symbol.</p>
               <p>Had not events shown that Jeff. Davis had never seen that old liberty-pole, and
                  never heard the chimes which still ring out from that old belfry? Who knew, in
                  these days when every woodsawyer has a "mission," but <emph>I</emph> had a
                  mission, and it was to tell the Rebel President that Northern liberty-poles still
                  stand for Freedom, and that Northern church-bells still peal out, "Liberty
                  throughout the land, to <emph>all</emph> the inhabitants thereof?"</p>
               <p>If that <emph>was</emph> my mission, will anybody blame me for fanning Mr. Davis
                  with a "blast" of cool Northern "wind" in this hot weather?—and might not that be
                  reason enough why I should go to Richmond?</p>
               <p>But enough of mystification. The straightforward reader wants a straightforward
                  reason, and he shall have it.</p>
               <p>I went to Richmond because I thought I could render material aid to Colonel
                  Jaquess, in paving the way to negotiations that might result in peace.</p>
               <p>If we should succeed, the consciousness of having served the country would, I
                  thought, pay our expenses. If we should fail, but return safely, we might still
                  serve the country by making public the cause of our failure. If we should fail,
                  and <emph>not</emph> return safely, but be shot or hanged as spies—as we might be,
                  for we could have no protection from our Government, and no safeconduct from the
                  rebels—two lives would be added to the thousands already sacrificed to this
                  rebellion; but they would as effectually serve the country as if lost on the
                  battle-field.</p>
               <p>These are the reasons, and the only reasons, why I went to Richmond.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
               <head type="sub">ON THE WAY TO RICHMOND.</head>
               <p>HAVING decided on accompanying Colonel Jaquess, I procured a pass to General
                  Grant's head-quarters, and, on a pleasant afternoon in July, went with him on
                  board of one of the small steamers plying between Washington and City Point. As we
                  stepped upon the gangway, a civil young gentleman, in linen trousers and the
                  undress coat of an infantry captain, said to me:</p>
               <p>"Your pass, sir."</p>
               <p>I produced the required paste-board, and coolly putting it in his pocket, he
                  remarked:</p>
               <p>"All right, sir."</p>
               <p>"Not exactly all right, my dear fellow. It will be when you return me the
                  pass."</p>
               <p>"But I'll see you safely to the General's. This is a kind I don't often get, and I
                  want to keep it."</p>
               <p>"And I prefer you shouldn't—perhaps for that very reason. So deliver."</p>
               <p>He did "deliver," but very reluctantly. However, he made amends for the slight
                  incivility by uncommon attention during the passage.</p>
               <p>The boat was crowded with passengers—officers returning from furlough, recruits
                  going to the field, convalescent veterans rejoining their regiments, and country
                  clergymen entering on the good work of the Sanitary and Christian Commissions—and
                  the trip was fruitful in incidents characteristic of the war, and illustrative of
                  the mighty transition which is regenerating the nation. But we are going to
                  Richmond, and the reader will not thank me if I linger by the way.</p>
               <p>It wanted several hours of sundown on the following day, when the boat rounded to
                  under the abrupt promontory which bears the name of City Point. A large flag was
                  flying among the trees which crown the higher part of the headland, and, making
                  our way to it, we asked for the quarters of the General.</p>
               <p>"Yonder, in that tent. He is sitting there, you see," replied the adjutant.</p>
               <p>Without more ceremony, we passed down the grassy avenue, and presented ourselves
                  before him. He was seated on a camp stool, smoking a cigar, and listening to the
                  reading of a newspaper by General Rawlins. A few other officers sat near, and
                  something which had just been read appeared to amuse them greatly. The General
                  looked up as we approached, and, as he espied my companion, rose rather
                  hastily.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Colonel," he said, extending his hand, "I am glad to see you. It's a long
                  time since we met. Not since—"</p>
               <p>"Pittsburg Landing, I believe, General. I think we met there," returned my
                  companion.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I remember. I remember the work you did there for the wounded. When did you
                  leave Sherman?"</p>
               <p>"About ten days ago. I brought dispatches from him to the War Department."</p>
               <p>"I have heard from him later than that. He is doing splendidly—handling his army
                  most magnificently."</p>
               <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6527-00000128"/>
               <p>Meanwhile, the Colonel had introduced me to the General, and at this break in the
                  conversation I said to him:</p>
               <p>"We want your ear, sir, privately, for a few moments."</p>
               <p>"Certainly; walk in this way." And rising, he led us into his sleeping apartment—a
                  square tent, with a single strip of carpet on the ground, a low camp-cot in one
                  corner, and a portable desk, covered with open papers, in the other.</p>
               <p>Handing him, then, a note I had with me, I briefly explained our wishes.</p>
               <p>"I don't believe the rebels will receive you. They have not answered a flag for a
                  month. However, I will send one. I shall have to address General Lee. Shall I say
                  you want to meet Judge Ould?" he asked, drawing his stool to the desk.</p>
               <p>"If you please, and suppose you add, that if there appears to Lee any objection to
                  Ould's meeting us, you would like to have him refer our request to Jeff.
                  Davis."</p>
               <p>"I'll do so," and he began the note. While he was writing it, I noted more
                  particularly his appearance. He is of about the medium height, with a large head,
                  a compact frame, and a deep, broad chest and shoulders. His hair is brown, his
                  eyes clear, deep gray, and his features regular, and of a cast that might be
                  called "Massive, Grecian." Though his first meeting with the Colonel was decidedly
                  cordial, his usual manner is cool and undemonstrative; but with this coolness is a
                  certain earnest simplicity, that impresses one very favorably. In his face is the
                  unyielding persistency which has won him so many battles, but there is nothing
                  else remarkable about him. He does not at once magnetize a stranger with a sense
                  of his genius, as does Rosecrans.</p>
               <p>The note finished, he read it to us. "Will that do?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir, when can it go off?"</p>
               <p>"At once. It'll go by boat to Point of Rocks, and from there to the Rebel lines;
                  but, at the earliest, you'll not get a reply before to-morrow night."</p>
               <p>The conversation then took a general turn, and in a clear, simple way he explained
                  the military position, expressing the opinion that the fall of Richmond and the
                  defeat of Lee, though they might be delayed, were inevitable events.</p>
               <p>As we rose to go, he said:</p>
               <p>"Where do you sleep to-night?"</p>
               <p>"We've engaged lodgings on the steamer. We hope to leave you to-morrow."</p>
               <p>As we passed down towards the wharf, we met a number of officers just landed from
                  a small steamer. One of them, though I had never seen him before, I knew at once
                  to be General Butler. Obeying a sudden impulse, I halted as he came abreast of us,
                  and said to him:</p>
               <p>"I want to take you by the hand; I am, myself, a live Yankee," and I mentioned my
                  name.</p>
               <p>Giving me a cordial grasp, he replied, "I'm delighted to meet you. Come up and see
                  me. Take the 'Gazelle' to Point of Rocks—don't go to Bermuda. Come to-morrow."</p>
               <p>I then introduced the Colonel, and the General again urging us to visit him, we
                  promised to do so.</p>
               <p>Reporting our intended absence to General Grant, and requesting him to forward
                  Lee's answer to us by telegraph, we set out on the following morning for the
                  head-quarters of "Our Massachusetts General." We found them about a mile distant
                  from the Appomatox river, in a worn-out tobacco-field, flanked on two sides by
                  dense woods, and hemmed in on the others<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6527-00000129"
                  /> by "moving" banks of Virginia sand. It was a dreary spot, but we forgot that,
                  the moment we entered the General's tent, and he accosted us with:</p>
               <p>"I'm glad you've come. There are two cots in the corner. They are yours. I sent
                  your flag this morning. It may not be back for some days. In the mean time make
                  yourselves at home. Go and come when you like, and do exactly as you please."</p>
               <p>We remained with the General nearly three days, and they were among the most
                  agreeable days I ever passed. We rode with him about his lines, witnessing his
                  reviews of the black troops, and his various experiments in "Greek fire,"
                  "Proclamation kite" flying, and "infernal shell" shooting, which are proving so
                  valuable to the army; or, when not so engaged, sat with him in his tent, listening
                  to his interesting political and military experiences, and getting such inside
                  glimpses of "But ler in New Orleans" as are not to be found even in Parton's
                  admirable book. With a keen sense of humor, an inexhaustible fund of anecdote, and
                  a ready, comprehensive intellect, he is about the most interesting and
                  entertaining conversationalist I ever knew. In hearing him, one loses the "power
                  of speech," and only sits still and listens. He knew our object in visiting
                  Rebeldom, and one morning I said to him:</p>
               <p>"General, you know Jeff. Davis. Tell us, how shall we approach him?—what shall we
                  say to him?"</p>
               <p>Drawing one leg over the other, and dilating his nostrils in a way peculiar to
                  himself, he answered:</p>
               <p>"Do you really want to know? Well, I'll tell you," and, throwing himself into an
                  attitude, he gave us for half an hour an imaginary conversation with the Rebel
                  leader, personating first him, and then the Colonel and myself, and "doing" us so
                  admirably that I almost fancied we ourselves were actually speaking. As he was
                  about concluding, General Meade entered the front tent, and as he rose to receive
                  his visitor, he turned on his heel, and—still speaking as Jeff. Davis—"finished
                  us" as follows:</p>
               <p>"Now, gentlemen, I've said my say, and if you don't clear out, and take your
                  Yankee notions to some other market, I'll hang you to the first tree—I will, as
                  I'm a Christian!"</p>
               <p>Afterwards, when listening to the much more serious words of the Rebel leader, I
                  had often to smile as General Butler's inimitable personation of him recurred to
                  me; and when again, late at night, we returned from the Rebel lines, and stiff
                  with long riding, and exhausted with fatigue and illness, I staggered into his
                  tent, and threw myself on a cot in the corner, I almost died with laughter while
                  the Colonel recounted to him the Richmond interview—it was so like the advance
                  representation he had given us. If we had known Jeff. Davis as General Butler
                  knows him, I very much question our having gone to Richmond.</p>
               <p>The next morning the flag-of-truce officer came into camp with a dispatch, of
                  which the following is a copy:</p>

               <p>At the appointed time we rode up to Mrs. Grover's, a modest plantation mansion,
                  about midway between the two armies, on the James River. Our "Southern friends"
                  were not there; but in the edge of a grove of cedars, a few hundred yards distant,
                  we saw a white flag aflying. Galloping rapidly across the intervening wheat-field,
                  we soon caught sight of-a pair of horses hitched to an open, two-seated wagon, and
                  near it saw three gentlemen seated on a log in the shade of a huge tree. These
                  gentlemen rose as we approached, and one of them—a courteous, middle-aged man, in
                  a Panama hat and a suit of spotless white drillings—said to Major Mulford, the
                  Union Commissioner, who accompanied us:</p>
               <p>"I'm glad to see you, Major. It's some time since we met."</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is. I've come now to deliver to you these gentlemen, to be shot or
                  hanged—whichever you like."</p>
               <p>The Judge—for it was Judge Ould—laughed, and then introduced us to his
                  companions—Captain Hatch, of the Commission, and Major Henniken, of the Rebel War
                  Department.</p>
               <p>Some unimportant conversation followed, and then, saying we would like to speak
                  with him privately, we led the Judge into the grove of cedars. There we opened our
                  business. He listened with interest, but expressed the opinion that Mr. Davis
                  would refuse to see us, unless we produced credentials from our Government.</p>
               <p>"We have none," said the Colonel, in his earnest way; "but we must see him. We
                  only ask a hearing. Then he may hang or shoot us, if he likes."</p>
               <p>"Hang, but hear!" answered the Judge, laughing. "That is what you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the Colonel. "We have that to say which Mr. Davis ought to hear, and
                  we are willing to risk our lives to say it."</p>
               <p>"Well," said the Judge, "I will bear your message to the President, and meet you
                  here again—when?"</p>
               <p>"To-morrow, at this hour, if you like."</p>
               <p>"That may be too early. Suppose we say the next day, Saturday, at twelve
                  o'clock."</p>
               <p>"Very well; Saturday let it be." And remounting our horses, we rode back to
                  General Butler's camp.</p>
               <p>We remained there the following day, and on the morning of Saturday, the 16th of
                  July, just as the Boston bells were sounding nine, taking him by the hand, we said
                  to him:</p>
               <p>"Good by. If you do not see us within ten days, you will know we have 'gone
                  up.'"</p>
               <p>"If I do not see you within that time," he replied, "I'll demand you; and if they
                  don't produce you, body and soul, I'll take two for one—better men than you
                  are—and hang them higher than Haman. My hand on that. Good by."</p>
               <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6527-00000131"/>
               <p>At three o'clock that afternoon, mounted on two raw-boned relics of Sheridan's
                  great raid, and armed with a letter to Jeff. Davis, a white cambric handkerchief
                  tied to a short stick, and an honest face—this last was the Colonel's—we rode up
                  to the rebel lines. A ragged, yellow-faced boy, with a carbine in one hand, and
                  another white handkerchief tied to another short stick in the other, came out to
                  meet us.</p>
               <p>"Can you tell us, my man, where to find Judge Ould, the Exchange
                  Commissioner?"</p>
               <p>"Yas. Him and t'other 'Change officers is over ter the plantation beyont Miss
                  Grover's. Ye'll know it by its hevin' nary door nur winder"—the mansion, he meant.
                  "They's all busted in. Foller the bridle-path through the timber, and keep your
                  rag a-flyin', fur our boys is thicker 'n huckelberries in them woods, and they
                  mought pop ye, ef they didn't seed it."</p>
               <p>Thanking him, we turned our horses into the "timber," and galloping rapidly on,
                  soon came in sight of the deserted plantation. Lolling on the grass, in the shade
                  of the windowless mansion, we found the Confederate officials. They rose as we
                  approached; and one of us said to the Judge:</p>
               <p>"We are late, but it's your fault. Your people fired at us down the river, and we
                  had to turn back and come over-land."</p>
               <p>"You don't suppose they saw your flag?"</p>
               <p>"No. It was hidden by the trees; but a shot came uncomfortably near us. It struck
                  the water, and ricocheted not three yards off. A little nearer, and it would have
                  shortened me by a head, and the Colonel by two feet."</p>
               <p>"That would have been a sad thing for you; but a miss, you know, is as good as a
                  mile," said the Judge, evidently enjoying the "joke."</p>
               <p>"We hear Grant was in the boat that followed yours, and was struck while at
                  dinner," remarked Captain Hatch—a gentleman, and about the best-looking man in the
                  Confederacy.</p>
               <p>"Indeed! Do you believe it?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know, of course;" and his looks asked for an answer. We gave none, for
                  all such information is contraband. We might have told him that Grant, Butler, and
                  Foster examined their position from Mrs. Grover's house—a few hundred yards
                  distant—two hours after the Rebel cannon-ball danced a break-down on the
                  Lieutenant-General's dinner-table.</p>
               <p>In addition to the Major Henniken previously spoken of, there were present, on
                  this occasion, several other officials, whose appearance indicated that we were to
                  be welcomed in Richmond.</p>
               <p>One of them was a stoutly built man, of medium height, with a short, thick neck,
                  and arms and shoulders denoting great strength. He looked a natural-born jailer,
                  and much such a character as a timid man would not care to encounter, except at
                  long range of a rifle warranted to fire twenty shots a minute, and to hit every
                  time. This was Mr. Charles Javins, of the Richmond Provost-Guard, and he was our
                  shadow in Dixie. Another was a "likely" "cullud gemman," named Jack, who told us
                  he was almost the sole survivor of "Massa Allen's" twelve hundred slaves—"De res'
                  all stole, Massa—stole by you Yankees,"—and the others were two mules hitched to
                  an ambulance, which, over ruts, stumps, and an awful sandy road, bore us safely to
                  the Rebel capital.</p>
               <p>To give us a <emph>moonlight view</emph> of the fortifications, Judge Ould
                  proposed to start after sundown; and as it wanted some hours of that time, we
                  seated ourselves on the ground, and entered into<pb n="262-263"
                     xml:id="VAC6527-00000132"/> conversation. The treatment of our prisoners, the
                     <emph>status</emph> of black troops, and non-combatants, and all the questions
                  which have led to the suspension of exchanges, had been good-naturedly discussed,
                  when the Captain, looking up from one of the Northern papers we had brought him,
                  said—</p>
               <p>"Don't you know, it mortifies me that you don't hate us as we hate you? You kill
                  us as Agassiz kills a fly—because you love us."</p>
               <p>"Of course we do. The North is being crucified for love of the South."</p>
               <p>"If you love us so, why don't you let us go?" asked the Judge, rather curtly.</p>
               <p>"For that very reason—because we love you. If we let you go, with slavery, and
                  your notions of 'empire,' you'd run straight to barbarism and the Devil."</p>
               <p>"We'd take the risk of that. But, let me tell you, if you are going to Mr. Davis
                  with any such ideas, you might as well turn back at once. He can make peace on no
                  other basis than Independence. Recognition must be the beginning, middle, and
                  ending of all negotiations. The people will accept peace on no other terms."</p>
               <p>"I think you are wrong there," said the Colonel. "When I was here a year ago, I
                  met many of your leading men, and they all assured me they wanted peace and
                  reunion, even at the sacrifice of slavery. Within a week, a man you venerate and
                  love has met me at Baltimore, and besought me to come here and offer Mr. Davis
                  peace on such conditions."</p>
               <p>"That may be. Some of our old men, who are weak in the knees, may want peace on
                  any terms; but the Southern people will not have it without Independence. Mr.
                  Davis knows them, and you will find he will insist upon that. Concede that, and
                  we'll not quarrel about minor matters."</p>
               <p>"We'll not quarrel at all. But it's sundown, and time we were 'on to
                  Richmond.'"</p>
               <p>"That's the 'Tribune' cry," said the Captain, rising; "and I hurrah for the
                  'Tribune,' for it's honest, and—I want my supper."</p>
               <p>We all laughed, and the Judge ordered the horses. As we were about to start, I
                  said to him:—</p>
               <p>"You 've forgotten our parole."</p>
               <p>"Oh! never mind that. We'll attend to that at Richmond."</p>
               <p>Stepping into his carriage, and unfurling the flag of truce, he then led the way,
                  by a "short cut," across the cornfield which divided the mansion from the
                  high-road. We followed in the ambulance, our shadow, Mr. Javins, sitting between
                  us and the twilight, and Jack occupying the front seat, and, with a stout whip,
                  "working our passage" to Richmond.</p>
               <p>Much that was amusing and interesting occurred during our three-hours' journey,
                  but regard for my word forbids my relating it. Suffice it to say, we saw the
                  "frowning fortifications," we "flanked" the "invincible army," and, at ten o'clock
                  that night, planted our flag (against a lamp-post) in the very heart of the
                  hostile city. As we alighted at the doorway of the Spots-wood Hotel, the Judge
                  said to the Colonel—</p>
               <p>"Button your outside coat up closely. Your uniform must not be seen here."</p>
               <p>The Colonel did as he was bidden; and, without stopping to register our names at
                  the office, we followed the Judge and the Captain up to No.60. It was a large,
                  square room, in the fourth story, with an unswept, ragged carpet, and bare
                     white<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6527-00000133"/> walls, smeared with soot and
                  tobacco-juice. Several chairs, a marble-top table, and a pine wash-stand and
                  clothes-press, straggled about the floor, and in the corners were three beds,
                  garnished with tattered pillow-cases, and covered with white counterpanes, grown
                  gray with longing for soapsuds and a wash-tub. The plainer and humbler of these
                  beds was designed for the burly Mr. Javins; the others had been made ready for the
                  extraordinary envoys (not envoys extraordinary) who, in defiance of all precedent
                  and the "law of nations," had just "taken Richmond."</p>
               <p>A single gas-jet was burning over the mantel-piece, and above it I saw a "writing
                  on the wall," which implied that Jane Jackson had run up a washing-score of fifty
                  dollars!</p>
               <p>I was congratulating myself on not having to pay that woman's laundry-bills, when
                  the Judge said:</p>
               <p>"You want supper. What shall we order?"</p>
               <p>"A slice of hot corn-bread would make <emph>me</emph> the happiest man in
                  Richmond."</p>
               <p>The Captain thereupon left the room, and, shortly returning, remarked:</p>
               <p>"The landlord swears you're from Georgia. He says none but a Georgian would call
                  for corn-bread at this time of night."</p>
               <p>On that hint we acted, and when our sooty attendant came in with the
                  supper-things, we discussed Georgia mines, Georgia banks, and Georgia mosquitoes,
                  in a way that showed we had been bitten by all of them. In half an hour it was
                  noised all about the hotel that the two gentlemen the Confederacy was taking such
                  excellent care of were from Georgia.</p>
               <p>The meal ended, and a quiet smoke over, our entertainers rose to go. As the Judge
                  bade us "good-night," he said to us:</p>
               <p>"In the morning you had better address a note to Mr. Benjamin, asking the
                  interview with the President. I will call at ten o'clock, and take it to him."</p>
               <p>"Very well. But will Mr. Davis see us on Sunday?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! that will make no difference."</p>

                           <p>"DEAR SIR:—The undersigned respectfully solicit an interview with
                              President Davis.</p>
                           <p>"They visit Richmond only as private citizens, and have no official
                              character or authority; but they are acquainted with the views of the
                              United States Government, and with the sentiments of the Northern
                              people, relative to an adjustment of the differences existing between
                              the North and the South, and earnestly hope that a free interchange of
                              views between President Davis and themselves may open the way to such
                                 <emph>official</emph> negotiations as will result in restoring
                              PEACE to the two sections of our distracted country.</p>
                           <p>"They therefore ask an interview with the President, and, awaiting
                              your reply, are</p>

               </q>
               <p>This was signed by both of us; and when the Judge called, as he had appointed, we
                  sent it—together with a commendatory letter I had received on setting out, from a
                  near relative of Mr. Davis—to the Rebel Secretary. In half an hour Judge Ould
                  returned, saying: "Mr. Benjamin sends you his compliments, and will be happy to
                  see you at the State Department."</p>
               <p>We found the Secretary—a short, plump, oily little man in black, with a keen black
                  eye, a Jew face, a yellow skin, curly black hair, closely-trimmed black whiskers,
                  and a ponderous gold watch-chain—in the northwest room of the "United States"
                  Custom-House. Over the door of this room were the words, "State Department," and
                  about its walls were hung a few maps and battle-plans. In one corner was a tier of
                  shelves, filled with books—among which I noticed Headley's "History," Lossing's
                  "Pictorial," Parton's "Butler," Greeley's "American Conflict," a complete set of
                  the "Rebellion Record," and a dozen numbers and several bound volumes of the
                  "Atlantic Monthly,"—and in the centre of the apartment was a black-walnut table,
                  covered with green cloth, and filled with a multitude of "State papers." At this
                  table sat the Secretary. He rose as we entered, and, as Judge Ould introduced us,
                  took our hands, and said:</p>
               <p>"I am glad, very glad, to meet you, gentlemen. I have read your note, and"—bowing
                  to me—"the letter you bring from ——. Your errand commands my respect and sympathy.
                  Pray be seated."</p>
               <p>As we took the proffered seats, the Colonel, drawing off his "duster," and
                  displaying his uniform, said:</p>
               <p>"We thank you for this cordial reception, Mr. Benjamin. We trust you will be as
                  glad to hear us as you are to see us."</p>
               <p>"No doubt I shall be, for you come to talk of peace. Peace is what we all
                  want."</p>
               <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6527-00000135"/>
               <p>"It is, indeed; and for that reason we have come to see Mr. Davis. Can we see him,
                  Sir?"</p>
               <p>"Do you bring any overtures to him from your Government?"</p>
               <p>"No, Sir. We bring no overtures and have no authority from our Government. We
                  state that in our note. We would be glad, however, to know what terms will be
                  acceptable to Mr. Davis. If they at all harmonize with Mr. Lincoln's views, we
                  will report them to him, and so open the door for official negotiations."</p>
               <p>"Are you acquainted with Mr. Lincoln's views?"</p>
               <p>"One of us is, fully?"</p>
               <p>"Did Mr. Lincoln, <emph>in any way,</emph> authorize you to come here?"</p>
               <p>"No, Sir. We came with his pass, but not by his request. We say, distinctly, we
                  have no official, or unofficial, authority. We come as men and Christians, not as
                  diplomatists, hoping, in a frank talk with Mr. Davis, to discover some way by
                  which this war may be stopped."</p>
               <p>"Well, gentlemen, I will repeat what you say to the President, and if he follows
                  my advice—and I think he will—he will meet you. He will be at church this
                  afternoon; so, suppose you call here at nine this evening. If any thing should
                  occur in the mean time to prevent his seeing you, I will let you know through
                  Judge Ould."</p>
               <p>Throughout this interview the manner of the Secretary was cordial; but with this
                  cordiality was a strange constraint and diffidence, almost amounting to timidity,
                  which struck both my companion and myself. Contrasting his manner with the quiet
                  dignity of the Colonel, I almost fancied our positions reversed, —that, instead of
                  our being in his power, the Secretary was in ours, and momently expected to hear
                  some unwelcome sentence from our lips. There is something, after all, in moral
                  power. Mr. Benjamin does not possess it, nor is he a great man. He has a keen,
                  shrewd, ready intellect, but not the <emph>stamina</emph> to originate, or even to
                  execute, any great good, or great wickedness.</p>
               <p>After a day spent in our room, conversing with the Judge, or watching the
                  passers-by in the street—I would like to tell who they were, and how they looked;
                  but such information is, just now, contraband—we called again, at nine o'clock, at
                  the State Department.</p>
               <p>Mr. Benjamin occupied his previous seat at the table, and at his right sat a
                  spare, thin-featured man, with iron-gray hair and beard, and a clear, gray eye,
                  full of life and vigor. He had a broad, massive forehead, and a mouth and chin
                  denoting great energy and strength of will. His face was emaciated, and much
                  wrinkled, but his features were good, especially his eyes—though one of them bore
                  a scar, apparently made by some sharp instrument. He wore a suit of grayish-brown,
                  evidently of foreign manufacture, and, as he rose, I saw that he was about five
                  feet ten inches high, with a slight stoop in the shoulders. His manners were
                  simple, easy, and most fascinating; and there was an indescribable charm in his
                  voice, as he extended his hand and said to us:</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see you, gentlemen. You are very welcome to Richmond."</p>
               <p>And this was the man who was President of the United States, under Franklin
                  Pierce, and who is now the heart, soul, and brains of the Southern
                  Confederacy!</p>
               <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6527-00000136"/>
               <p>His manner put me entirely at my ease—the Colonel would be at his, if he stood
                  before Cæsar—and I replied:</p>
               <p>"We thank you, Mr. Davis. It is not often that you meet men of our clothes and our
                  principles in Richmond."</p>
               <p>"Not often—not so often as I could wish; and I trust your coming may lead to a
                  more frequent and a more friendly intercourse between the North and the
                  South."</p>
               <p>"We sincerely hope it may."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Benjamin tells me that you have asked to see me to—"</p>
               <p>And he paused, as if desiring we should finish the sentence. The Colonel
                  replied:</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir. We have asked this interview, in the hope that you may suggest some way
                  by which this war may be stopped. Our people want peace,—your people do, and your
                  Congress has recently said that <emph>you</emph> do. We have come to ask how it
                  can be brought about."</p>
               <p>"In a very simple way. Withdraw your armies from our territory, and peace will
                  come of itself. We do not seek to subjugate you. We are not waging an offensive
                  war, except so far as it is offensive-defensive—that is, so far as we are forced
                  to invade you to prevent your invading us. Let us alone, and peace will come at
                  once.</p>
               <p>"But we cannot let you alone so long as you repudiate the Union. That is the one
                  thing the Northern people will not surrender."</p>
               <p>"I know. You would deny to us what you exact for yourselves—the right of
                  self-government."</p>
               <p>"No, Sir," I remarked. "We would deny you no natural right. But we think Union
                  essential to peace; and, Mr. Davis, <emph>could</emph> two people, with the same
                  language, separated by only an imaginary line, live at peace with each other?
                  Would not disputes constantly arise, and cause almost constant war between
                  them?"</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly—with this generation. You have sown such bitterness at the South; you
                  have put such an ocean of blood between the two sections, that I despair of seeing
                  any harmony in my time. Our children may forget this war, but <emph>we</emph>
                  cannot."</p>
               <p>"I think the bitterness you speak of, Sir," said the Colonel, "does not really
                  exist. <emph>We</emph> meet and talk here as friends; our, soldiers meet and
                  fraternize with each other; and I feel sure that if the Union were restored, a
                  more friendly feeling would arise between us than has ever existed. The war has
                  made us know and respect each other better than before. This is the view of very
                  many Southern men; I have had it from many of them—your leading citizens."</p>
               <p>"They are mistaken," replied Mr. Davis. "They do not understand Southern
                  sentiment. How can we feel any thing but bitterness towards men who deny us our
                  rights! If you enter my house and drive me out of it, am I not your natural
                  enemy?"</p>
               <p>"You put the case too strongly. But we cannot fight forever; the war must end at
                  some time; we must finally agree upon something; can we not agree now, and stop
                  this frightful carnage? We are both Christian men, Mr. Davis. Can
                     <emph>you,</emph> as a Christian man, leave untried any means that may lead to
                  peace?"</p>
               <p>"No, I cannot. I desire peace as much as you do. I deplore bloodshed as much as
                  you do; but I feel that not one drop of the blood shed in this war is on
                     <emph>my</emph> hands—I can look<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6527-00000137"/> up
                  to my God and say this. I tried all in my power to avert this war. I saw it
                  coming, and for twelve years I worked night and day to prevent it, but I could
                  not. The North was mad and blind; it would not let us govern ourselves, and so the
                  war came, and now it must go on till the last man of this generation falls in his
                  tracks, and his children seize his musket and fight our battle, <emph>unless you
                     acknowledge our right to self-government.</emph> We are not fighting for
                  slavery. We are fighting for Independence, and that, or extermination, we
                     <emph>will</emph> have."</p>
               <p>"And there are, at least, four and a half millions of us left; so you see you have
                  a work before you," said Mr. Benjamin, with a decided sneer.</p>
               <p>"We have no wish to exterminate you," answered the Colonel. "I believe what I have
                  said—that there is no bitterness between the Northern and Southern people. The
                  North, I know, loves the South. When peace comes, it will pour money and means
                  into your hands to repair the waste caused by the war; and it would now welcome
                  you back, and forgive you all the loss and bloodshed you have caused. But we
                     <emph>must</emph> crush your armies, and exterminate your Government. And is
                  not that already nearly done? You are wholly without money, and at the end of your
                  resources. Grant has shut you up in Richmond. Sherman is before Atlanta. Had you
                  not, then, better accept honorable terms while you can retain your prestige, and
                  save the pride of the Southern people?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis smiled.</p>
               <p>"I respect your earnestness, Colonel, but you do not seem to understand the
                  situation. We are not exactly shut up in Richmond. If your papers tell the truth,
                  it is your capital that is in danger, not ours. Some weeks ago, Grant crossed the
                  Rapidan dan to whip Lee, and take Richmond. Lee drove him in the first battle, and
                  then Grant executed what your people call a 'brilliant flank movement,' and fought
                  Lee again. Lee drove him a second time, and then Grant made another 'flank
                  movement;' and so they kept on—Lee whipping, and Grant flanking—until Grant got
                  where he is now. And what is the net result? Grant has lost seventy-five or eighty
                  thousand men—<emph>more than Lee had at the outset</emph>—and is no nearer taking
                  Richmond than at first; and Lee, whose front has never been broken, holds him
                  completely in check, and has men enough to spare to invade Maryland and threaten
                  Washington! Sherman, to be sure, <emph>is</emph> before Atlanta; but suppose he
                  is, and suppose he takes it? You know that the farther he goes from his base of
                  supplies, the weaker he grows, and the more disastrous defeat will be to him. And
                  defeat <emph>may</emph> come. So, in a military view, I should certainly say our
                  position was better than yours.</p>
               <p>"As to money: we are richer than you are. You smile; but, admit that our paper is
                  worth nothing—it answers as a circulating medium, and we hold it all ourselves. If
                  every dollar of it were lost, we should, as we have no foreign debt, be none the
                  poorer. But, it <emph>is</emph> worth something; it has the solid basis of a large
                  cotton-crop, while yours rests on nothing, and you owe all the world. As to
                  resources: we do not lack for arms or ammunition, and we have still a wide
                  territory from which to gather supplies. So, you see, we are not in extremities.
                  But, if we were—if we were without money, without food, without weapons—if our
                  whole country were desolated, and our armies crushed and disbanded—could we,
                  without giving up our manhood, give up our right to govern ourselves?<pb
                     n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6527-00000138"/> Would <emph>you</emph> not rather die,
                  and feel yourself a man, than live, and be subject to a foreign power?"</p>
               <p>"From your stand-point there is force in what you say," replied the Colonel. "But
                  we did not come here to argue with you, Mr. Davis. We came, hoping to find some
                  honorable way to peace, and I am grieved to hear you say what you do. When I have
                  seen your young men dying on the battle-field, and your old men, women, and
                  children starving in their homes, I have felt I could risk my life to save them.
                  For that reason I am here; and I am grieved—grieved—that there is no hope."</p>
               <p>"I know your motives, Colonel Jaquess, and I honor you for them; but what can I do
                  more than I am doing? I would give my poor life, gladly, if it would bring peace
                  and good-will to the two countries; but it would not. It is with your own people
                  you should labor. It is they who desolate our homes, burn our wheat-fields, break
                  the wheels of wagons carrying away our women and children, and destroy supplies
                  meant for our sick and wounded. At your door lies all the misery and the crime of
                  this war, and it is a fearful—fearful account."</p>
               <p>"Not all of it, Mr. Davis. I admit a fearful account, but it is not
                     <emph>all</emph> at our door. The passions of both sides are aroused. Unarmed
                  men are hanged, prisoners are shot down in cold blood, by yourselves. Elements of
                  barbarism are entering the war from both sides, that should make us—you and me, as
                  Christian men—shudder to think of. In God's name, then, let us stop it. Let us do
                  something, concede something, to bring about peace. You cannot expect, with only
                  four and a half millions, as Mr. Benjamin says you have, to hold out forever
                  against twenty millions."</p>
               <p>Again Mr. Davis smiled.</p>
               <p>"Do you suppose there are twenty millions at the North determined to crush
                  us?"</p>
               <p>"I do—to crush your <emph>Government.</emph> A small number of our people, a very
                  small number, are your friends—Secessionists. The rest differ about measures and
                  candidates, but are united in the determination to sustain the Union. Whoever is
                  elected in November, he <emph>must be</emph> committed to a vigorous prosecution
                  of the war."</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis still looking incredulous, I remarked—</p>
               <p>"It is so, Sir. Whoever tells you otherwise, deceives you. I think I know Northern
                  sentiment, and I assure you it is so. You know we have a system of
                  lyceum-lecturing in our large towns. At the close of these lectures, it is the
                  custom of the people to come upon the platform and talk with the lecturer. This
                  gives him an excellent opportunity of learning public sentiment. Last winter I
                  lectured before nearly a hundred of such associations, all over the North—from
                  Dubuque to Bangor—and I took pains to ascertain the feeling of the people. I found
                  a unanimous determination to crush the rebellion and save the Union at every
                  sacrifice. The majority are in favor of Mr. Lincoln, and nearly all of those
                  opposed to him are opposed to him because they think he does not fight you with
                  enough vigor. The radical Republicans, who go for slave-suffrage and thorough
                  confiscation, are those who will defeat him, if he is defeated. But if he is
                  defeated before the people, the House will elect a worse man—worse I mean for you.
                  It is more radical than he is—you can see that from Mr. Ashley's reconstruction
                  bill—and the people are more radical than the House. Mr. Lincoln, I know, is about
                  to call out five hundred thousand<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6527-00000139"/> more
                  men, and I don't see how you <emph>can</emph> resist much longer; but if you do,
                  you will only deepen the radical feeling of the Northern people. They would now
                  give you fair, honorable, <emph>generous</emph> terms; but let them suffer much
                  more, let there be a dead man in every house, as there is now in every village,
                  and they will give you <emph>no</emph> terms—they will insist on hanging every
                  rebel south of——Pardon my terms. I mean no offence."</p>
               <p>"You give no offence," he replied, smiling very pleasantly. "I wouldn't have you
                  pick your words. This is a frank, free talk, and I like you the better for saying
                  what you think. Go on."</p>
               <p>"I was merely going to add, that let the Northern people once really feel the
                  war—they do not feel it yet—and they will insist on hanging every one of your
                  leaders."</p>
               <p>"Well, admitting all you say, I can't see how it affects our position. There are
                  some things worse than hanging or extermination. We reckon giving up the right of
                  self-government one of those things."</p>
               <p>"By self-government you mean disunion—Southern Independence."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"And slavery, you say, is no longer an element in the contest?"</p>
               <p>"No, it is not. It never was an essential element. It was only a means of bringing
                  other conflicting elements to an earlier culmination. It fired the musket which
                  was already capped and loaded. There are essential differences between the North
                  and the South, that will, however this war may end, make them two nations."</p>
               <p>"You ask me to say what I think. Will you allow me to say that I know the South
                  pretty well, and never observed those differences?"</p>
               <p>"Then you have not used your eyes. My sight is poorer than yours, but I have seen
                  them for years."</p>
               <p>The laugh was upon me, and Mr. Benjamin enjoyed it.</p>
               <p>"Well, Sir, be that as it may, if I understand you, the dispute between your
                  government and ours is now narrowed down to this: Union or Disunion."</p>
               <p>"Yes; or, to put it in other words, Independence or Subjugation."</p>
               <p>"Then the two governments are irreconcilably apart. They have no alternative but
                  to fight it out. But, it is not so with the people. They are tired of fighting and
                  want peace; and, as they bear all the burden and suffering of the war, is it not
                  right they should have peace, and have it on such terms as they like?"</p>
               <p>"I don't understand you; be a little more explicit."</p>
               <p>"Well. Suppose the two governments should agree to something like this: To go to
                  the people with two propositions; say: Peace, with Disunion and Southern
                  Independence, as your proposition; and: Peace, with Union, Emancipation, No
                  Confiscation, and Universal Amnesty as ours. Let the citizens of all the United
                  States (as they existed before the war) vote 'Yes,' or 'No,' on these two
                  propositions, at a special election within sixty days. If a majority vote
                  Disunion, our government to be bound by it, and to let you go in peace. If a
                  majority vote Union, yours to be bound by it, and to stay in peace. The two
                  governments can contract in this way, and the people, though constitutionally
                  unable to decide on peace or war, can elect which of any two propositions shall
                  govern their rulers. Let Lee and Grant, meanwhile, agree to an armistice.<pb
                     n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6527-00000140"/> This would sheathe the sword; and, if
                  once sheathed, it would never again be drawn by this generation."</p>
               <p>"The plan is altogether impracticable. If the South were only one State, it might
                  work; but, as it is, if one Southern State objected to emancipation, it would
                  nullify the whole thing, for you are aware the people of Virginia cannot vote
                  slavery out of South Carolina, or the people of South Carolina vote it out of
                  Virginia."</p>
               <p>"But three-fourths of the States can amend the Constitution. Let it be done in
                  that way—in <emph>any</emph> way, so that it be done by the people. I am not a
                  statesman or a politician, and I do not know just how such a plan could be carried
                  out; but you get the idea—that the PEOPLE shall decide the question."</p>
               <p>"That the <emph>majority</emph> shall decide it, you mean. We seceded to rid
                  ourselves of the rule of the majority, and this would subject us to it again."</p>
               <p>"But the majority must rule finally, either with bullets or ballots."</p>
               <p>"I am not so sure of that. Neither current events nor history shows that the
                  majority rules, or ever did rule. The contrary, I think, is true. Why, Sir, the
                  man who shall go before the Southern people with such a proposition—with
                     <emph>any</emph> proposition which implied that the North was to have a voice
                  in determining the domestic relations of the South—could not live here a day! He
                  would be hanged to the first tree, without judge or jury."</p>
               <p>"Allow me to doubt that. I think it more likely he would be hanged if he let the
                  Southern people know the majority could not rule," I replied, smiling.</p>
               <p>"I have no fear of that," rejoined Mr. Davis, also smiling most good-humoredly. "I
                  give you leave to proclaim it from every house-top in the South."</p>
               <p>"But, seriously, Sir, you let the majority rule in a single State; why not let it
                  rule in the whole country?"</p>
               <p>"Because the States are independent and sovereign. The country is not. It is only
                  a confederation of States; or rather it <emph>was:</emph> it is now
                     <emph>two</emph> confederations."</p>
               <p>"Then we are not a <emph>people</emph>—we are only a political partnership?"</p>
               <p>"That is all."</p>
               <p>"Your very name, Sir, '<emph>United</emph> States,' implies that," said Mr.
                  Benjamin. "But, tell me, are the terms you have named—Emancipation, No
                  Confiscation, and Universal Amnesty—the terms which Mr. Lincoln authorized you to
                  offer us?"</p>
               <p>"No, Sir. Mr. Lincoln did not authorize me to offer you any terms. But I
                     <emph>think</emph> both he and the Northern people, for the sake of peace,
                  would assent to some such conditions."</p>
               <p>"They are <emph>very</emph> generous," replied Mr. Davis, for the first time
                  during the interview showing some angry feeling. "But Amnesty, Sir, applies to
                  criminals. We have committed no crime. Confiscation is of no account unless you
                  can enforce it; and Emancipation! You have already emancipated nearly two millions
                  of our slaves, and if you will take care of them, you may emancipate the rest. I
                  had a few when the war began. I was of some use to them; they never were of any to
                  me. Against their will you 'emancipated' them; and you may 'emancipate' every
                  negro in the Confederacy, but we will be free! We will govern ourselves! We
                     <emph>will</emph> do it, if we have to see every Southern plantation sacked,
                  and every Southern city in flames!"</p>
               <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6527-00000141"/>
               <p>"I see, Mr. Davis, it is useless to continue this conversation," I replied; "and
                  you will pardon us if we have seemed to press our views with too much pertinacity.
                  We love the old flag, and that must be our apology for intruding upon you at
                  all."</p>
               <p>"You have not intruded upon me," he replied, resuming his usual manner. "I am glad
                  to have met you, both. I once loved the old flag as well as you do. I would have
                  died for it; but now it is to me only the emblem of oppression."</p>
               <p>"I hope the day may never come, Mr. Davis, when <emph>I</emph> say that," said the
                  Colonel.</p>
               <p>A half-hour's conversation on other topics—not of public interest—ensued, and then
                  we rose to go. As we did so the Rebel President gave me his hand, and, bidding me
                  a kindly "good-by," expressed the hope of seeing me again in Richmond in happier
                  times—when peace should have returned—but with the Colonel his parting was
                  particularly cordial. Taking his hand in both of his, he said to him:</p>
               <p>"Colonel, I respect your character and your motives, and I wish you well—I wish
                  you every good I can wish you consistently with the interests of the
                  Confederacy."</p>
               <p>The quiet, straightforward bearing, and magnificent moral courage of our "fighting
                  parson" had evidently impressed Mr. Davis very favorably.</p>
               <p>As we were leaving the room, he added:</p>
               <p>"Say to Mr. Lincoln from me, that I shall at any time be pleased to receive
                  proposals for peace on the basis of our Independence. It will be useless to
                  approach me with any other."</p>
               <p>When we went out, Mr. Benjamin called Judge Ould, who had been waiting during the
                  whole interview—two hours—at the other end of the hall, and we passed down the
                  stairway together. As I put my arm within that of the Judge, he said to me:</p>
               <p>"Well, what is the result?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing but war—war to the knife."</p>
               <p>"Ephraim is joined to his idols—let him alone," added the Colonel, solemnly.</p>
               <p>The next day we visited Castle Thunder, Libby Prison, and the hospitals occupied
                  by our wounded, and at sundown passed out of the Rebel lines, thankful, devoutly
                  thankful, that we were once again under the folds of the old flag.</p>
               <p>Thus ended our visit to Richmond. I have endeavored to sketch it faithfully. The
                  conversation with Mr. Davis I took down shortly after returning to the Union
                  lines, and I have tried to report his exact language, extenuating nothing and
                  coloring nothing that he said. Some of his sentences, as I read them over, appear
                  stilted and high-flown, but they did not sound so when uttered. As listened to,
                  they seemed the simple, natural language of his thought. He spoke deliberately,
                  apparently weighing every word, and well knowing that all he said would be given
                  to the public.</p>
               <p>He is a man of great ability. Our interview explained to me why with no money and
                  no commerce, with nearly every one of their important cities in our hands, and
                  with an army greatly inferior in numbers and equipment to ours, the Rebels have
                  held out so long. It is because of the energy, sagacity, and indomitable will of
                  Jefferson Davis. Without him the Rebellion would crumble to pieces in a day; with
                  him it may continue to be, even in disaster, a power that will tax the whole
                  energy and resources of the nation.</p>

               <p>The Southern people want peace. Many of the Southern leaders want it—both my
                  companion and I, by correspondence and intercourse with them, know this—but there
                  can be no peace so long as Mr. Davis controls the South. Ignoring Slavery, he
                  himself states the issue—the only issue with him—Union or Disunion. That is it. We
                  must conquer or be conquered. We can negotiate only with the bayonet. We can have
                  peace only by putting forth all our strength, crushing the Southern armies, and
                  overthrowing the Southern Government.</p>
