               <p>'HETTY! Hetty! Where on earth has that child gone to? Here's the bread-dough up as
                  light as a sponge, and the butter just come, and all the cheeses to be turned,
                  besides shaping yesterday's butter for the market. Hetty! where are you?"</p>
               <p>There was no reply to this speech, which seemed a little sharp and querulous in
                  tone, but there was a pause in the hurried movements in the long, shady
                  dairy-room, and directly a pleasant, motherly face showed itself in the kitchen
                  window, and then, to command a wider view, peered anxiously out of the open back
                  door.</p>
               <p>"O! dear suz!" The accent was strong on the last word, which is not to be found in
                  the dictionary, though it has been in use for many generations. It expresses a
                  hopeless perplexity of mind, as well as a giving up to perverse circumstances.</p>
               <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6508-00000004"/>
               <p>There was a whimsical mixture of vexation and amusement in the expressive looks
                  that accompanied the exclamation; for, away down in the big pasture, skirted by
                  the intervening mowing-lots, she saw Hetty perched upon the back of a half-broken
                  colt, and cantering up and down in serene unconsciousness of all bread or butter
                  making responsibilities. She was riding fearlessly without a saddle, and with no
                  bridle except the rope-halter which had tied the animal in its stall. She wore
                  neither hat nor bonnet, and her long dark hair floated out upon the wind without
                     restraint.<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref>
               </p>

               </note>
               <p>"O! dear suz!" said the mother again, admiring, in spite of her sense of
                  propriety, the picturesque grace of both horse and rider. "Sixteen years old
                  to-morrow, and the biggest romp in the country. Whoever did she take it from? I
                     <emph>should</emph> like to know. I hope that colt wont break her neck. Mark,"
                  she called to a tall young man who stood by the gate of the cattle-yard watching
                  Hetty's equestrian performance—"Mark, I wonder that you will let that careless
                  child mount that wild colt."</p>
               <p>"I did not <emph>let</emph> her. I thought she was busy in the house, until I
                  heard the pony's feet clattering down the lane. It was too late to hinder it
                  then."</p>
               <p>"She was in the house five minutes ago, and I need her there now more than that
                  crazy colt is worth."</p>
               <p>"She is coming back, I think."</p>
               <p>"Ah! well," noticing the young man's grave looks, "she is only a child, Mark."
                  Hetty had turned her face homeward, and now, with a variety of sideway curveting
                  and prancing, rode briskly up to the barn-yard.</p>
               <p>A pretty picture she made with the roses that exercise had brought glowing on her
                  cheeks, and the laughing brown eyes almost black with pleasure and excitement. But
                  the face clouded and the color deepened as she met Mark's glance of disapproval.
                  With a quick, angry gesture, she declined his aid in dismounting, and springing
                  lightly to the ground, passed him without speaking. It was very plain that she
                  needed no assistance. Just a moment she paused to pat the neck of the pony, who
                  returned the caress by licking her hands.</p>
               <p>"Come, Sylph," said Mark, taking hold of the halter, "you forget that while you
                  are frolicking the work is waiting."</p>
               <p>This speech, though addressed to the pony, was, as Hetty well understood, intended
                  for her benefit. She bit her lips, and tossed her head indignantly; then, catching
                  sight of her mother, she ran lightly up the path to the house.</p>
               <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6508-00000005"/>
               <p>"Coming, mother, dear. Have you missed me at all?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Hetty, child, what a color you have! You have tired yourself out, and here I
                  shall need your help all the morning."</p>
               <p>"No, mother, I am not a bit tired. I feel just like working. What comes first? The
                  butter?"</p>
               <p>"I will see to that. You may mold the bread. You see it is high time. I doubt if
                  it is not sour. It has been rising itself to death."</p>
               <p>"It is as sweet as a nut, mother," said Hetty, testing it as she spoke by both
                  smell and taste.</p>
               <p>"But you look too warm to do any thing. Sit down by the window and cool off before
                  you touch the work."</p>
               <p>"It is only my temper, mother, dear."</p>
               <p>"Temper, child!"</p>
               <p>"Yes. It makes me as cross as a bear to have Mark look as he does if I am not as
                  prim as a bean-pole. It is none of his business how I ride or when. He doesn't own
                  me, or Sylph either, for that matter."</p>
               <p>"Mark is a fine young fellow, Hetty. He has lived here so long that it is not
                  strange if he is interested in your behavior. Why, he used to take care of you
                  when you were a mere baby."</p>
               <p>"I don't care if he did. He was never cross with me till lately. You ought to have
                  seen him at the singing-school recess last Friday evening. You would have thought
                  I had broken all the ten commandments."</p>
               <p>"Well, what <emph>had</emph> you been doing?" There was a touch of motherly
                  anxiety in the voice that asked this question. Hetty burst out laughing.</p>
               <p>"O dear! It was such fun. You know how Mark hates tobacco. Well, Sam Wells and
                  James Cook had some cigars that Sam's uncle brought from some place at the other
                  end of the world, I believe. They were just as proud as peacocks, standing by the
                  door and smoking them. So, Lena Woods and I got some pieces of grape-vine, and
                  stationed ourselves on the other side of the door-step, and imitated the boys as
                  well as we could. You would have laughed, mother, if you had seen the airs that we
                  put on."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," said the mother doubtfully. "Was Mark there?"</p>
               <p>"You remember he went first to old Granny Dyer's to chop some wood for her, so he
                  was not able to reach the school till recess. He came up just as we had managed to
                  light those vines, and get a good draught of smoke through them. And he thought
                  they were <emph>real</emph> cigars," said Hetty, bursting into fresh laughter at
                  the recollection. "And the best of it is, he don't know yet that he was
                  mistaken."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bowen said nothing for a few minutes.<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6508-00000006"
                  /> Hetty watched her face with some misgivings. Was it true that even her mother,
                  who laughed at all her childish pranks, was going to be serious over them now?</p>
               <p>"Any way, it is none of Mark's business," she said aloud.</p>
               <p>"There are others besides Mark," said her mother gently, "who love Hetty well
                  enough to wish her a little more womanly."</p>
               <p>Hetty was silent; but as she deftly shaped the loaves of bread, and set them away
                  for the last indispensable rising before baking, her thoughts were busy. Judging
                  from the changeful expression of her eyes, and the merry dimples that played
                  around the cherry lips, she had forgotten her momentary vexation.</p>
               <p>"Mother," said she, presently, "what became of grandpa's famous horse? Black Selim
                  was his name, wasn't it?"</p>
               <p>"Bless me, child!" exclaimed her mother, "whoever has put Black Selim into your
                  head?"</p>
               <p>Hetty smiled roguishly as her mother turned completely away from her, and also
                  from the butter that she was trimming into fancy balls for the tables of some
                  especially particular customers.</p>
               <p>"I heard father talking to Uncle George about him the other day. I was in the
                  stable with Sylph, and so I happened—I mean," said truthful Hetty, "that I heard
                  what he said."</p>
               <p>"Well, what did he say?"</p>
               <p>"O! he said that horse was the most wonderful animal he ever saw; that he was so
                  fiery it was nearly impossible to manage him, and that only two persons could
                  mount him. And he said—"</p>
               <p>"Well?"</p>
               <p>"He said that the first time he ever saw you, mother, you were riding on that
                  horse without any saddle, just as I ride Sylph. And you were bareheaded, and
                  barefooted, too."</p>
               <p>"What a story!"</p>
               <p>"Isn't it true, mother?"</p>
               <p>"What else did he say?"</p>
               <p>"O! that it was just the prettiest sight he ever saw. That he fell in love with
                  you on the spot—couldn't help it."</p>
               <p>"If he is your father, Hetty, I must say he ought to be ashamed of putting such
                  nonsense into your head."</p>
               <p>"Well, to tell the truth, he didn't know I was hearing him till he had told it
                  all, and I asked him how old you were."</p>
               <p>"And he told you that too, I suppose," said the mother, almost laughing out as she
                  thought of the good deacon's dismay when he found Hetty listening to his
                  indiscreet narrative.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Hetty, "he said you were eighteen<pb n="14-15"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000007"/> een. That is just two years older than I am,
                  mother."</p>
               <p>"Twenty years ago, Hetty, people did many things that would look strange now. The
                  country was unsettled, and the farmers lived so remote from each other that they
                  scarcely influenced each other's manners at all. Few of the girls wore shoes in
                  summer, except on Sundays or holidays, and they had to learn to harness and manage
                  horses for themselves. Indeed, there are many places even in Massachusetts where
                  the women share the men's work now. You know little about the hardships of life,
                  my child, and I pray that you never may."</p>
               <p>"And so you really had to manage that wild horse that every body was afraid of.
                  Poor mother!" said Hetty pityingly, with her eyes fairly dancing with
                  merriment.</p>
               <p>"Why, no—not exactly—that is—ahem! Hetty, this is such a fine breezy day, I think
                  we will hang out all the woollen blankets and give them a thorough airing. You
                  just run up and get them out of the presses while I finish here. I will call Mark
                  to help put out the clothes-line."</p>
               <p>"Yes, mother."</p>
               <p>Hetty's voice and manner were as demure as possible; but her mother understood all
                  the repressed pressed fun of the maiden's thoughts as well as if it had been
                  spoken.</p>
               <p>"Sakes alive!" she said to herself as soon as she was alone, "what on earth
                  possessed the deacon to rake up those old times, and with that child in hearing,
                  too! I shall have to speak to him at once. There is no telling what that little
                  mischief will get out of him, now she is on the scent. He ought to know better
                  than to tell George. I do think that men—well," said Mrs. Bowen, shaking her head
                  decidedly, "men are a sight of care, to say the least."</p>
               <p>Raising her eyes, she saw Mark standing just outside of the window. He had a roll
                  of stout canvas bags in his hand.</p>
               <p>"I agree with you in that, Aunt Bowen."</p>
               <p>"Why, Mark! Did you hear me?"</p>
               <p>"Only a few words. I am going to the mill. Can you spare Hetty to go with me? She
                  can go in to see Nanny White, the miller's daughter, while the corn is being
                  ground."</p>
               <p>"Let me see. I am pretty busy, but I can put off airing the clothes, and a part of
                  the ironing, till to-morrow. Hetty, child," she called, "here's Mark wants you to
                  ride over to the mill with him. How soon can you be ready?"</p>
               <p>"I can't go," answered Hetty, with her head out of the chamber window.</p>
               <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6508-00000008"/>
               <p>"You had better," said the young man. "It is a charming morning."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Hetty, quoting his own words as gravely as if they had originated with
                  her; "but while we were frolicking the work would be waiting. First work and then
                  play, is the best plan always."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bowen laughed aloud. Hetty's wise speech was comically absurd, coming from
                  such roguish lips. But Mark turned shortly on his heel, and marched back to the
                  stables without another word. Hetty's practical use of his hint was any thing but
                  agreeable.</p>
               <p>Hetty watched him down the path with a feeling of mingled regret and defiance. She
                  and Mark always had such good times when they went together, and she had never
                  before refused to go.</p>
               <p>"I don't care," she said at last. "He need not lecture me if he wants me to go
                  with him. I wont give him another chance to find fault for a whole week if—if I
                  can help it."</p>
               <p>With all Hetty's love for frolic, she was not an idle girl as it regarded work,
                  and she seemed to have an intuitive knowledge as to the manner in which the work
                  should be done.</p>
               <p>"I am sure," her mother often said to the deacon, "I don't know where the child
                  got her handy way of doing things. She always takes hold of the right end, and it
                  is all play to her. And she is always singing. I do believe if the house were on
                  fire she would sing while she helped put out the fire."</p>
               <p>"If she were only a boy," suggested the good man one morning when his wife was
                  unusually full of Hetty's merits.</p>
               <p>"A boy!" repeated the mother indignantly. "That would just spile her. Goodness
                  knows," she went on, warming up as she talked, "she is enough like a boy now. Mark
                  heard Farmer Reed's wife say last Sabbath-day that our Hetty was the biggest
                  tom-boy in Weymouth. I think you had better wish she was more like a woman."</p>
               <p>"I knew a girl once," said the deacon reflectively, "who was every bit and grain
                  as crazy-headed as our Hetty, and she steadied down into a capital woman."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw!" said the deacon's wife.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE PILGRIM FATHERS.</head>
               <p>ONE hundred years ago it was acknowledged by all the worshipers in the old
                  Weymouth "meetin' house" that there was never any thing sweeter in the way of
                  music than the voice of Mehetabel Bowen. There were other good singers, for
                  Weymouth people then had the reputation for musical genius which has ever since
                  distinguished them; but Hetty's voice, floating along over the quirks and changes
                  of the quaint old fugues then in favor, had a separate charm; and the rough
                  farmers and their stalwart sons listened with hushed breath, lest they should lose
                  a note of the wondrous melody.</p>
               <p>When the young damsel was singing her whole character seemed to change. There was
                  no mistaking the reverence with which she rendered the meaning of the poet, albeit
                  the curious construction of the verse and the more curious pronunciation of many
                  words would provoke smiles and irreverence now. In reading them over, one can only
                  wonder at the mighty gift for gravity that the olden congregations tions
                  possessed. That Hetty, with her keen perception of the ludicrous, was able to see
                  only the devotional beauty of the paraphrased psalms and hymns, speaks well for
                  the piety of the times. It is more than likely that the quaint phraseology
                  heightened her sense of the sacred reality of the worship.</p>
               <p>Her voice always trembled on the first notes. She herself could not have told why.
                  But the soft, mellow tones rose gradually higher and clearer, the timid
                  ascriptions of praise grew more confident, the utterance of the words sweeter and
                  richer, till the arches of the high roof seemed filled with the golden harmony.
                  There was no consciousness of self about her; she was completely lost in the
                  music, singing as the wild birds sing in the dim depths of the forest. She was
                  wholly insensible to the admiring looks raised to the high gallery from the square
                  pews below, or the eager glances of the great, bashful lads, who noted every
                  change of expression in the rapt dark eyes, as well as the varying crimson on the
                  round cheek.</p>
               <p>Mark Woodward, too, was a member of the choir. His voice was a rich, clear tenor,
                  blending admirably with the deacon's heavy bass. The deacon had been the leader of
                  the choir for twenty years.</p>
               <p>It is a question if good Parson Smith realized<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000010"/> all his obligations to the choir. The tedium of his
                  prosiest sermons were forgotten as soon as the last hymn was heard swelling out
                  fresh and mellow, as if it had been inspired by his oratory. The grand doxology,
                  in which all the people joined, must have had a sublime effect upon the weary
                  pastor. It came rolling and swelling up under the huge sounding-board that
                  canopied the pulpit, and the very air seemed trembling with holy triumph.</p>
               <p>I know all about it, for all the Sundays of my childhood were spent in the same
                  old church, venerable then in its olden aspect, but more beautiful by far than any
                  of the modern edifices for church worship that now adorn the old town. It seems a
                  pity that the old "meetin' house" was not permitted to remain. There would have
                  been a wonderful interest in it for the present generation. There were plenty of
                  eligible sites for the new church, but it seems not to have occurred to any one
                  that it was possible to worship God on any other spot. It was crowded full of
                  memories in which I have a personal ownership, for was it not my
                  great-great-grandmother, I wonder, who sang so sweetly in Parson Smith's choir,
                  and whose musical talent, divided and subdivided into innumerable parts in its
                  transmission to later generations, now envelops all the region with an atmosphere
                  of song?</p>
               <p>The old church belonged to our earliest American history. It was one of the first,
                  if not the first, built in New England. Its oak panelings and carvings were
                  wrought out two centuries ago. To the lineal descendant of the Puritan colonists
                  there is something more than the mere lapse of time suggested by the words, "Two
                  hundred years ago." They comprehend a world of interest and romance.</p>
               <p>The "good old colony times when we lived under the king" have just enough of the
                  magical glamour of antiquity to make them our golden age. The names of the stern
                  magistrates and statesmen, the fathers who shaped the pattern of our free
                  government, are immortal. The very privations and toil that they endured have a
                  charm for us. We take it as a part of our glorious inheritance.</p>
               <p>The Mayflower coming to anchor, after its long, stormy passage across the deep,
                  shows to us now no trace of the perils that it encountered. We see it in the
                  gloomy winter harbor, but every sail and spar is tipped with soft, poetic light,
                  the mellow radiance that long years and tradition have thrown over them. We
                  idealize even the bleak winds that nearly killed the unaccustomed voyagers. There
                  is beauty in the rough seachest of Brewster, for on its lid the first compact was
                  drawn and signed by the forty-one<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6508-00000011"/> sturdy
                  fathers who were the leaders of the heroic company. No exercise of reason can make
                  us believe that the big iron pot of Captain Miles Standish was an ordinary pot. It
                  is gold to our reverent eyes.</p>
               <p>At the time our story commences Hetty's great-grandfather was living, and although
                  his mind was dim in regard to more recent events, his memories of the earliest
                  Puritan times were perfect. Mark and Hetty never tired of his narrations, and it
                  was the old man's delight to sit on the wide settle on the back porch, and pour
                  into their eager ears the history of the past.</p>
               <p>He told them of the terrible sufferings that followed that first landing of
                  emigrants, before the tardy spring came to their relief. Fifty, out of one hundred
                  and one, died of the "hardships and the sore sickness."</p>
               <p>Hetty's tears would fall like April showers over the untimely fate of the gentle
                  widow of Governor John Carver, who could not live after the death of "so gracious
                  a husband," and whose broken heart, in six weeks' time, found rest in the grave by
                  the side of the beloved one.</p>
               <p>The old man threw a wonderful pathos into his narratives. He was evidently living
                  his youth over again. And the young folks listened with breathless attention,
                  though they had heard the tale until they could almost have told it
                  themselves.</p>
               <p>Hetty did not laugh over the unfortunate result of Captain Miles Standish's
                  attempt to woo a bride by proxy. Her sympathy was all for the desolate widower,
                  whose first wife and only love, the fair Rose Standish, slept on the bleak
                  hillside with the wives of Edward Winslow and Isaac Allerton. She never tired of
                  the scanty records of the Puritan mothers.</p>
               <p>The old man had but little to say about them. Like all the historians of that
                  period, he seemed to be wholly taken up with the exploits of the men.</p>
               <p>"Tell us about the women, grandpa," Hetty would say. "About the mothers and wives
                  and sisters."</p>
               <p>"I guess there isn't much to tell. I do not remember."</p>
               <p>"But there were women there. They made a part of the little colony in the
                  wilderness. They kept house in those rude huts that you tell us about."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, child. I suppose so."</p>
               <p>"I think men are awful conceited by nature," Hetty would say to Mark, because it
                  was not quite respectful to say it to her grandfather. "Those poor women. How hard
                  they worked<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6508-00000012"/> to make things cosey and
                  homelike, and even their names are forgotten!"</p>
               <p>"Not all of them, Hetty."</p>
               <p>"The greater part, any way. And it is a shame. You know it is."</p>
               <p>We are inclined to agree with Hetty. It is a shame. Our Pilgrim mothers were, the
                  most of them, nurtured delicately. They were wholly unused to life in the desert.
                  Unknown forests and vast seas separated them from other points of civilization,
                  and their neighbors were heathen savages. Added to this was the terrible climate,
                  and the utter absence of the comfortable appliances that now enable the New
                  Englander to defy the weather.</p>
               <p>No wonder that so many delicate women fainted and died. The wonder is that any of
                  them had the courage to live. The trackless wilderness around was then tenanted by
                  dangerous wild beasts, whose savage freedom had never been disturbed. In front was
                  the dreary waste of waters, foaming and dashing upon the shore in awful solitude.
                  It is all like a fairy tale to us, for the wilderness and solitary places have
                  since been made glad by thousands of fair homes, and the desert truly rejoices and
                  blossoms as the rose.</p>
               <p>Ah! yes, it is a shame that there are so few memorials of those wives and mothers!
                  Only tradition tells of their heroic endurance and industry. Among the relics kept
                  in the Pilgrim Hall at Plymouth is a faded sampler wrought by Lorea Standish, the
                  daughter of the redoubtable Miles. She was a "fair young damsel and a pious,"
                  besides being "conveniently skillful" with her needle; and we hope that she kept
                  her father's house so well that he had scarcely reason to regret the decision of
                  the winsome Priscilla Mullins, who, with a premature cropping out of "woman's
                  rights" tendencies, had herself proposed marriage to John Alden. Here is the
                  legend worked upon the sampler:— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Lorea Standish is my name.</l>
                        <l>Lord, guide my hart that I may doe thy will;</l>
                        <l>And fill my hands with such convenient skill</l>
                        <l>As may conduce to virtue void of shame,</l>
                        <l>And I will give the glory to thy name."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We should like to know more about the sprightly Mary Chilton, whose foot was the
                  first to touch the rock at the famous landing of the Pilgrims. Perhaps the grave
                  men who witnessed this "forwardness of the maiden" felt it a religious duty to
                  curb her wild spirits into more seemly decorum, though one would naturally suppose
                  that any gayety possible under the circumstances might have been tolerated. That
                  the damsel in question was snubbed into propriety may be inferred from the fact
                  that the<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6508-00000013"/> ancient records make no further
                  mention of her deeds. She was probably one of the strong-minded sisterhood, and
                  doubtless henpecked some good Puritan husband who fancied his rule over her to be
                  absolute.</p>
               <p>Hetty was especially curious in regard to Mistress Alice Bradford, whose corsets
                  are still so carefully preserved at Plymouth. The comely wearer little dreamed of
                  such an immortality for them when her cunning fingers wrought the fine
                  stitching.</p>
               <p>"Surely, grandpa, you must remember her. Was she very beautiful?"</p>
               <p>"I remember that your great-aunt was named after her—that is all. She must have
                  been nigh on to fifty years old when I was born, and we came to live here when I
                  was twelve years old."</p>
               <p>"What a pity! And you can't remember how she looked when she first came to
                  America?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Hetty!" remonstrated Mark, as he noted the troubled look that the effort to
                  recall what she wished brought to the old man's face. "How can you expect him to
                  remember what took place before he came into the world!"</p>
               <p>Hetty laughed merrily. A moment's silent calculation showed her the absurdity of
                  her demand. "Poor grandpa!" she said coaxingly, "I wont tease you any more about
                  the women. They are forgotten, and they will have to stay so. We will go back to
                  the old stories that you tell so nicely about the Indians and their queer ways of
                  living. I hope they were cleaner than those Indians I saw when father took us to
                  Connecticut to see Uncle Shubael."</p>
               <p>The old man started off unsuspiciously on the familiar track, and was soon so
                  happily lost in the past that it was difficult to recall his scattered senses to
                  the present, when the twilight faded, and careful Mrs. Bowen came out to lead him
                  safely to his bed.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE GOOD OLD TIMES.</head>
               <p>WE will leave our regular story just long enough to get an idea of the times
                  described by Hetty's grandfather, and also glance at the later chronicles which
                  bring us down nearly to Hetty's day.</p>
               <p>With so many cosy southern inlets and sheltered bays all along the coast, it seems
                  a pity that the Pilgrims should have fallen upon a "stern and rock-bound coast,"
                  so cold and desolate. They seem, however, to have liked the situation, for, after
                  the discovery of more genial localities, they clung to their sterile soil as if it
                  had been a paradise of balmy air and fertility. The raw sea air, if it was any
                  relation to the cutting breezes that the east brings to us now, was enough to
                  dishearten the stoutest spirit; but these resolute men and women could not be
                  discouraged.</p>
               <p>Their attachment to the sandy east shore has been transmitted in its full strength
                  to their descendants. It would be a difficult task indeed to convince one of the
                  present generation that the changeful climate is not the most delightful lightful,
                  as well as the most healthful, in the world. It is impossible to express the
                  curious sense of pity that the Massachusetts people feel for the unfortunates
                  whose birthplace happens to be outside of their State. No matter into what
                  charming countries their enterprise may lead them, or how bounteously nature may
                  spread out her beauties in other lands, the fealty of the heart is unchanged, and
                  they honestly believe that the old Bay State contains all that is most lovely and
                  valuable in the world. The second colony from England seems to have formed a
                  different opinion. They very soon began to look out for a more genial climate.
                  They stayed in Boston long enough to see the summer and winter changes, and they
                  had no desire to ever experience them again; so in April, 1638, they re-embarked
                  and sailed down around the cape, and then coasted leisurely along the shore until
                  they entered the waters of the sound, and cast anchor at Quinipiac, now New Haven.
                  This was, even then, a most attractive region. It was a favorable time to
                  appreciate its loveliness. The soft air was especially delightful after the
                  alternate freezing and thawing of the past year.</p>
               <p>Most people have a sufficient sense of the beautiful to enjoy the exquisite
                  changes of a great forest when it is just waking into new<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000015"/> life; to note the feathery green of the elms, the
                  faint verdure of the maples, the swelling buds of the oak, and the brightening
                  tints that glow in the heavy fringes of the evergreens. But New Haven was not all
                  woodland. There were level green meadows sloping down toward the sound, and the
                  southern hill-sides were already gay with grasses and flowers. The agricultural
                  and commercial advantages of the spot were plainly to be seen, and there seems to
                  have been no hesitancy in taking possession.</p>
               <p>The first thing they did was to hold a service of praise to God, who had safely
                  led them across the sea to this fair Canaan. And then Davenport, looking out upon
                  the beautiful hills and plains, preached a sermon from this text: "Then was Jesus
                  led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil." The civil
                  compact drawn up by this new colony was agreed upon and signed within the rude
                  walls of a barn. It was not modeled after any form of government then existing,
                  but after the law of Moses.</p>
               <p>In spite of all the ridicule of later times, it must be conceded that the laws
                  then framed worked well. The State prospered under them wonderfully. Open vice had
                  a hard time of it. In the records of the times, we read that on "the fifth day of
                  February, 1639, Isaiah, Captaine taine Turner's man, was fined five pounds for
                  being druncke on the Lord's day."</p>
               <p>Two men, who stole "five pound seventeen shillings," were sentenced to make double
                  restitution, and then were publicly whipped. Whipping was a favorite method of
                  punishing the lesser crimes. William Blagden was whipped for not attending
                  meeting, although his clothes "being all wet through the preceding day," he was
                  obliged to spend the Sunday in bed. If all who sin in this way now were to be
                  punished in like manner, what a mighty wail would go up all over the land!</p>
               <p>The chivalry of the times did not exempt the women from the discipline of the rod.
                  One fair girl narrowly escaped it, for we read that Jacobeth Murline and Sarah
                  Tuttle were prosecuted "for sitting on a chest together, his arme about her waiste
                  and her arme upon his shoulder, and continuing it yt. sinfull position about half
                  an hour, in which time he kyssed her and she kyssed him, or they kyssed one
                  another as ye witnesses testified."</p>
               <p>Each of these affectionate culprits were sentenced to pay twenty shillings to the
                  treasurer. Lucky Sarah Tuttle! The "kyss" was rather a costly luxury at "20s.,"
                  but the fine was far preferable to the whipping-post. We hope the gallant Jacobeth
                  paid her share as well as his own.</p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6508-00000016"/>
               <p>If the women of those times were in the least like their daughters of this
                  generation, they must have appreciated the ludicrous element in some of these
                  laws. The very constable who led the offenders to punishment, and gravely applied
                  the specific number of lashes, must have been mirth-provoking. We can almost hear
                  the hearty laughter that the mischievous damsels and their mothers indulged in
                  when the stern law-makers were not looking. The trivial nature of the
                  transgressions could not have shocked the moral sense of a reasonable community,
                  and, human nature being the same in all ages, the fun of the matter must have
                  shown itself in the undignified penalty. The pompous air of the official, and <q>

                        <l rend="ti-1">Were so queer."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We smile at the strictness that controlled the smallest matters, and allowed no
                  infraction of discipline to go unpunished; but it is doubtless to this very spirit
                  of petty domineering that we owe the sorrow and shame which all descendants of the
                  Massachusetts colony must feel so long as history endures. For in less than a
                  score of years after their own escape from religious persecution they were
                  themselves exhibiting an intolerance as bigoted and inflexible ible as that from
                  which they had fled. Their painful exile seems to have hardened rather than
                  softened their natures.</p>
               <p>During those years about two hundred ships had made their way to what was
                  considered a paradise of freedom, and the population had increased to twenty
                  thousand persons, who built churches and school-houses, as well as
                  dwelling-houses, along the valleys and hill-sides. But only fifteen years after
                  the landing of the Mayflower voyagers Sir Richard Saltonstall wrote from England:
                  "It doth grieve my spirit to hear what sad things are reported daily of your
                  tyranny and persecution in New England, as that you fine, whip, and imprison men
                  for their consciences." The ministers of religion were all active politicians, and
                  many of them served as magistrates. Woeful, indeed, was the fate of the culprits
                  who were brought before men whose tender consciences quite overruled the humaner
                  impulses of the heart.</p>
               <p>Roger Williams was banished from Salem in the dead of winter because of his
                  tolerant views in religious matters. Through the thick forests, where the
                  untrodden snow showed no path, and where his only hope of food and shelter was in
                  the hospitality of Indians, he found his way to the head of Narragansett Bay, out
                  of the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts settlers.</p>
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6508-00000017"/>
               <p>Here he founded a really free colony, and called the place Providence. It was a
                  most appropriate name under the circumstances. The persecuted from the other
                  colonies gathered to him joyfully, realizing now in truth the blessings of
                  religious freedom.</p>
               <p>Newport, beautiful Newport, was also settled by refugees from religious
                  intolerance; and as early as 1644 all the settlements of that region were united
                  under the title of "Rhode Island and Providence Plantations," with a free charter
                  of incorporation. The motto upon the seal adopted by them was very expressive, and
                  showed well the sweet spirit that governed them. It was <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >Amor vincit omnia</foreign>—"Love conquers all things." The haughty bigotry of
                  the Massachusetts colony was not contented with fining and whipping those who
                  differed from them in opinion. The blood of martyrs stained their hands, and will
                  always disgrace their annals.</p>
               <p>During the forty years that the New England Confederacy lasted, Massachusetts
                  considered herself practically the sovereign of the other colonies, and all Europe
                  regarded her as New England. The Canadians called the inhabitants of all the
                  provinces "Bostonians." Even when Newport, growing with unexampled rapidity in
                  wealth and population, became the social capital of the country, and by its
                  graceful refinements became the center of attraction to foreigners, Massachusetts
                  still held its supremacy. Its stern will was accepted as the will of all the
                  people. It is not a modern "Boston notion" that locates the "Hub of the Universe;"
                  but from the earliest days, all along the years down to the present time, Boston
                  has asserted its pre-eminence.</p>
               <p>It is a pity that Rhode Island did not retain its beautiful Indian name,
                  Aquidneck, ("Isle of Peace,") for it had a peculiar appropriateness when it became
                  an asylum from persecution. Roger Williams says, "It was obtained by love." It was
                  not exactly a gift, however, though so little was paid for it that it may well be
                  considered one. Land that now brings two thousand dollars an acre, even when it
                  includes the rocky bits on the shore, was gladly sold by the ignorant Indians for
                  little or nothing. The whole of the lovely "Isle of Peace" was bought of the
                  chiefs for twenty-three broadcloth coats and thirteen hoes, "as also two
                  torkepos," whatever these might have been.</p>
               <p>Taking advantage of the Christian spirit of toleration in this settlement, the
                  Quakers flocked from all sides to Newport. This religious element has continued,
                  and remains vigorous to the present day. The charmed visitors to<pb n="36-37"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000018"/> Newport still see the prim Quaker costumes on every
                  side.</p>
               <p>The unfortunate Mary Dyer, whose sad fate thrills us with horror, was the wife of
                  one of the first settlers. Not being able to believe in the terrible bigotry of
                  the Puritans, she ventured into the Massachusetts territory to visit some dear
                  friends. She never saw her peaceful home again. She was arrested and executed for
                  being a Quaker. Pride certainly shows a curious phase of itself where it tempts
                  any of us to exult in our Puritan ancestry.</p>
               <p>It is tyranny like this which confirms the fealty of the heart to a principle. As
                  a natural sequence, one half of the Newporters straightway became Quakers.</p>
               <p>As an evidence of their free policy is the fact that Samuel Hopkins found a home
                  and toleration among them. He was the most eminent divine in Newport during the
                  last century. His appalling doctrines do not seem to have taken very deep root in
                  the minds of the people, though they cordially liked the man. We read that "Other
                  Calvinists were willing that their neighbors should be predestined to everlasting
                  misery for the glory of God. This noble-minded man demanded a more generous and
                  impartial virtue, and maintained that we should consent to our own perdition. if
                  the greatest good of the universe, and the manifestations of the Divine
                  perfections, should so require."</p>
               <p>The peace-loving Friends allowed him to teach whatever he pleased, with not even
                  the terrors of the whipping-post to deter him. Indeed, the salutary virtues
                  waiting to be revealed in hickory switches, poetically termed "twigs of the
                  wilderness," seem to have been little appreciated outside of the Puritan
                  possessions. Very likely the climate had something to do with this difference of
                  feeling, for in our day we find that the strongest advocates of capital punishment

               <head type="sub">A PURITAN SABBATH.</head>
               <p>IT was near the close of a lovely Sabbath-day in August, 1774. To look at the
                  peaceful aspect of affairs at Deacon Bowen's home-farm, no one would have dreamed
                  of the political ferment seething all over the country and filling all minds with
                  excitement. So far as possible, the good Deacon had excluded the gathering turmoil
                  from his Sabbath, even forbidding all mention of it during the hours sacred as
                  holy-time.</p>
               <p>In this he had been more strict than his minister, who, under the guise of his
                  morning prayer, had given the oppressive home government, as the colonists
                  designated the British rule, some tremendous hits, and thereby exasperated the
                  partisans on either side to any thing but a Christian spirit.</p>
               <p>Nothing of this, however, showed itself at the farm. In the front entry sat good
                  Mistress Bowen, seemingly intent upon the pages of the big family Bible which lay
                  in her lap, opening of its own accord at the history of the wars of the kings of
                  Israel and Judah. Every now and then her eyes wandered from the record and sought
                  the western sky, watching with just a touch of hidden impatience the slow,
                  downward progress of the sun, whose disappearance would loosen the strict law of
                  inactivity under which her stirring nature rebelled, by showing an unaccountable
                  facility in planning all the work of the coming week; for there are no earthly
                  rules that can fetter the thoughts, however they may restrict the freedom of
                  speech.</p>
               <p>She had watched the sunset of yesterday with very different feelings, doing her
                  best to accomplish all possible work before its disappearance; for the moment that
                  the king of day withdrew from sight behind the western forests the Puritan Sabbath
                  began, and Saturday evening was holy-time.</p>
               <p>In his high-backed arm-chair, by the west window of the keeping-room, sat the old
                  grandfather, his eyes also fixed upon the glowing sky, but with no impatience in
                  their rapt glance. Not a passing cloud dimmed the sweet serenity of his face; the
                  troublous cares for either family or country were all past for him. His life had
                  no present; but the memories of early life reached forward and clasped hands with
                  cloudless anticipations of the eternal day just breaking upon his sight.</p>
               <p>The deacon sat on the broad door-stone. A<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6508-00000020"/>
                  bright silk handkerchief was thrown lightly over his head. If he had retired under
                  its shadow for religious contemplation, we fear that some of Parson Smith's
                  ringing petitions in regard to earthly matters mingled with the spiritual thoughts
                  that belonged to the day and hour. The deacon knew how to keep his own counsel,
                  and if he were battling for the right, he fought in silence.</p>
               <p>Out in the front yard, Mark and Hetty sat on a rustic bench under a magnificent
                  willow-tree, whose branches canopied the house. Mark held a book in his hand, but
                  he was not reading. The changeful expression of his face showed him to be thinking
                  intensely upon some subject of absorbing interest. He had not strictly obeyed the
                  deacon's rules in regard to the exciting topic of the times, but had spent an hour
                  of the Sabbath noon-time in earnest discussion with the young men of the parish,
                  and his cheek kindled now as he recalled the resolute defiance expressed by the
                  patriot youth. As ever, the young hot blood of the country was all for war, and
                  they looked upon the counsels of moderation from the lips of their elders as an
                  expression of cowardice.</p>
               <p>Of the little family group, Hetty alone seemed indisposed to either read or
                  meditate. She was heartily tired of the Sabbath-time, and she took little pains to
                  conceal her disgust at its prolonged dullness. Her eyes roved uneasily from one
                  point of the rich landscape to another, glancing oftenest at the clear sun, whose
                  course seemed never to have been so tardy.</p>
               <p>It was a lovely view that was spread out before her. First came the green
                  home-meadows, skirted by woodlands, arrayed in their deepest summer verdure. There
                  were here and there shadowy openings into the forest depths, showing cool, grassy
                  ravines, or the gray front of some massive rock. The upland pastures at the south
                  were belted with spicy pines, whose delicious aroma refined while it scented the
                  sweet evening air. Away to the north the yellow light shimmered upon the placid,
                  slumbrous waters, over which a single ship was making its slow way into the harbor
                  at Boston.</p>
               <p>The poetic beauty of the landscape was all lost upon Hetty. She took no note of
                  the exquisite sunset tints, the soft quiet of the hour, the droning buzz of the
                  Sabbath-breaking bee just finishing its day's work, or even the delicate
                  loveliness of the illuminated willow-tassels drooping just over her head. Only one
                  feeling possessed her, and that was an impatient waiting for the Sabbath to be
                  over.</p>
               <p>At last the sun went down. Hetty sprang to her feet with a glad "hurrah," which
                  roused the<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6508-00000021"/> deacon from his meditations so
                  suddenly that he rubbed his eyes in bewilderment. The old man leaned anxiously out
                  of the window and asked feebly what was the matter.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, grandpa. Only I am <emph>so</emph> thankful that lazy old sun is out of
                  sight at last. I do believe it stays up an hour longer on Sundays just to spite
                  us."</p>
               <p>"Hetty," said her mother reprovingly, "that is not a right spirit."</p>
               <p>"No, I suppose not. But it is a wonder that I have any spirit left of any kind. Do
                  let us stir round, for pity's sake, now we have got a chance. Every bone in me
                  aches with keeping still."</p>
               <p>"My child," said the mother, smiling in spite of the deacon's grave looks, "you
                  must learn to be patient."</p>
               <p>"Look here, Hetty," said Mark, who saw the cloud on the deacon's face, "let me
                  read these verses to you. They are worth hearing."</p>
               <p>"No, you don't." Hetty began to dance up and down the path. "No reading for me, if
                  you please. This tiresome, tiresome day is ended at last, and now I am going to
                  enjoy myself."</p>
               <p>"Mehetabel," said the deacon sternly, "is it possible that a daughter of mine can
                  speak in such a manner of the Lord's day?"</p>
               <p>When her father called her "Mehetabel," Hetty knew that he was seriously
                  displeased with her. She stopped short in her playful dance and looked at him
                  wistfully, while her lips trembled and her eyes filled with tears.</p>
               <p>"La sakes, father," said the soft-hearted mother, "it is only the child's way. She
                  don't half mean it, I'm sure."</p>
               <p>"A poor way, mother, a poor way. She's old enough to feel a proper reverence for
                  sacred things."</p>
               <p>Having thus uttered the strongest rebuke that his sunny temper permitted, he
                  turned away to look after the evening farm-work with a feeling of relief, for
                  which his conscience stoutly reproached him.</p>
               <p>Hetty watched her mother as she silently followed him through the long entry, and
                  then she turned to Mark. He understood her too well to add any reproving words of
                  his own. He waited until she had relieved herself with a hearty, childish
                  crying-spell, and then he only attempted to speak soothingly.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry for you, Hetty. You do not mean any thing wrong, as your mother
                  says."</p>
               <p>"I am not so sure of that," replied Hetty, snapping her eyes rather too spunkily
                  to express penitence. "I mean a good deal more than I say."</p>
               <p>"But you get so weary, Hetty, that you are not to blame for feeling
                  impatient."</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6508-00000022"/>
               <p>"Mark, I suppose I am the wickedest girl in Weymouth. I don't like these dull,
                  pious doings, and I never shall. They just fidget my wits out. I don't like the
                  long, prosy prayers and sermons, and these long afternoons at home when we must
                  keep still."</p>
               <p>"No. You are naturally active, and it tires you."</p>
               <p>"Father prays twice as long on Sundays as on week-days, and he reads the longest
                  chapters in the Bible. There is no end to it. And then comes the meeting. What is
                  the use of Parson Smith's praying for every thing that ever was heard of? I stand
                  first on one foot and then on the other, and wonder if he will ever stop. I am
                  almost too mad to sing after it. But the singing always does me good. To be sure,
                  he preaches for ever and ever afterward; but up in the gallery I can see what
                  folks have on, and it don't seem so terribly long as it used when I sat with
                  mother in the pew. What are you laughing at?"</p>
               <p>"At your frankness, Hetty; you confess all your short-comings."</p>
               <p>"Long-comings, you mean. There is nothing short on Sundays. I saw Mistress Abigail
                  Adams in the minister's pew. Her dress had a cape, cut round in the back, with
                  long points in front. I shall cut my linen cambric like it."</p>
               <p>"I must go and help about the milking, Hetty. The last time we sung in meeting
                  keeps in my head all the time."</p>
               <p>"Yes. Was it not grand?" Hetty began to hum over the bars of music.</p>
               <p>"The second tune was not bad. When all the parts swell up together on that third
                  strain, I feel as if we were very near heaven."</p>
               <p>"But we fall from heaven mighty quick, Mark, when the sermon begins. If the whole
                  service was made up of singing praises, I think I could be good all the week; but
                  now," continued Hetty, her eyes again filling with tears, "I vex father out of his
                  senses, and worry mother, too. Father sleeps all through the sermon, and mother
                  eats caraway and fennel to keep her awake; and even you, Mark—"</p>
               <p>"Well, what do I do?"</p>
               <p>"No matter. I am going to find father, and make up. Do you think he will forgive
                  me?" asked Hetty, smiling roguishly through her tears as she reflected upon the
                  impossibility of the deacon's cherishing a feeling of displeasure toward any
                  thing, least of all toward his pet child.</p>
               <p>Mark watched her admiringly as she tripped lightly down the path.</p>
               <p>"I wonder," he thought, "if Hetty knows how very handsome she is."</p>
               <p>He lingered behind a moment to give time for<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000023"/> the proposed reconciliation. A single glance at the
                  parties, as he approached the milking-yard, showed that all was right between
                  them; that, as Hetty phrased it, "they had made up."</p>
               <p>The young girl stood with one arm thrown lightly across the deacon's shoulder,
                  while he was briskly milking a vicious cow, which would stand still for no one
                  else. Even now she resented Hetty's proximity, and caring nothing about the
                  peace-making, whisked her tail, and tossed her head so spitefully, that Hetty was
                  fain to withdraw into the back ground as speedily as possible.</p>
               <p>"Steady, now! Sho! sho!" said the deacon soothingly. "We'll have this job all to
                  ourselves, wont we, my beauty? Stand still, can't you?"</p>
               <p>The cow had an unmistakable will of her own, and perversely declined to "stand
                  still" until she had turned completely round and taken up a position that
                  commanded a view of the whole yard, and permitted no approach without her
                  ladyship's knowledge.</p>
               <p>"It's lucky for you," said the deacon, when he was once more allowed to plant his
                  milking-stool by her side, "lucky for you that you give the richest milk in the
                  town. If it were not for your capital butter, old lady—there, there, beauty! Sho!
                  Hetty, keep back out of her sight. If this aint a master-critter to hold a spite,
                  I never saw one."</p>
               <p>As if to justify his opinion, Mrs. Brindle tossed her head scornfully, snuffed the
                  air on either side, as if it were not good enough to breathe, and then
                  deliberately kicked over the pail.</p>
               <p>"Now you've done it, you pesky torment, you." The deacon watched the rich, white
                  milk, spreading itself into a lake at his feet, for a moment, and then he turned
                  to Mark. "I'd like to give her a good licking," he said, "but that would spile her
                  temper entirely. There's no use in coaxing her to-night; besides, I had nearly
                  finished her. I'll leave the rest of them for you to milk, and go down and tinker
                  that fence at the head of the lane. It wouldn't take much to break it down. If
                  Brindle should get her horns through it, she would walk into that fall-mowing
                  without stopping to ask leave."</p>
               <p>"Shall I go with you, father?"</p>
               <p>"No, Hetty, I shall be back directly."</p>
               <p>She looked up earnestly into his face. "You are sure, father, that you will forget
                  my foolish talk?"</p>
               <p>He smiled as he bent down and kissed her cheek. "My child, if you were a Christian
                  you would love the Lord's day. The holy Sabbath would be a delight instead of a
                  burden."</p>
               <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6508-00000024"/>
               <p>"But I am not a Christian, father."</p>
               <p>"I pray that God will make you one in his own good time," said the deacon
                  reverently.</p>
               <p>Neither father nor daughter, though both familiar with the Scriptures, had learned
                  the glad truth that God's time to make Christians is always <emph>now.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>An unusually thoughtful look spread over Hetty's face as her father left her. She
                  remained silent so long that Mark turned round in some surprise to find out what
                  had befallen her.</p>
               <p>"Mark, are <emph>you</emph> a Christian?"</p>
               <p>The abrupt question was rather startling, but he answered readily: "I hardly know;
                  I hope so at times."</p>
               <p>"I should think you would <emph>know</emph> if there is any thing in it. I suppose
                  I am a reprobate."</p>
               <p>"O no, Hetty! The children of praying parents inherit the blessing."</p>
               <p>"Well, there is no use in bothering my head with it. If I am one of the elect, I
                  shall be saved whether or no; if not, there is no chance, if I try ever so hard
                  for it. I can do nothing any way. It is a queer fix," said Hetty, without the
                  faintest feeling of irreverence;" but I suppose it will be managed somehow. I
                  don't like to think about it."</p>
               <p>"When I am reading the Bible, Hetty, I often think that the matter of our
                  salvation lies a good deal in our own hands. All along we are invited and urged to
                  seek God, and there are promises without number to such as do seek him. I don't
                  see what right we have to limit the grace that he freely offers."</p>
               <p>"Father says you have some strange notions."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I have. One thing is sure, Hetty, it is always safe and right to seek
                  after God."</p>

               <head type="sub">AN ORPHAN BOY.</head>
               <p>ALTHOUGH Mark Woodward always addressed Deacon Bowen and his wife as "Uncle" and
                  "Aunt," he was, in truth, no way related to either of them. His father was a
                  sea-captain. Mark remembered but little about him, for he spent but a short time
                  on shore, and was drowned when the boy was only seven years old.</p>
               <p>Mark could recall all the details of the sad accident, as he had heard them told
                  to his mother by the sailor who brought the news, and he often pictured to himself
                  the little boat which was capsized and broken to pieces on the coast of Cuba, in
                  one of those sudden squalls peculiar to tropical latitudes.</p>
               <p>Next came the long sickness of his mother, who began to droop and pine away as
                  soon as the terrible tidings reached her. In one year from that time Mark was
                  motherless as well as fatherless, and literally alone in the world. There was an
                  aunt living in Boston, but she was a widow, and already burdened with the support
                  of eight children. The oldest of these was not large enough to earn its own
                  living.</p>
               <p>Kind Mrs. Bowen had left her own happy home to watch by the sick-bed of her
                  unfortunate neighbor, and it was her gentle hands that closed the tired eyes for
                  their last sleep, and arrayed the cold form for its burial. When the funeral was
                  over she brought home the desolate little boy, just to stay a few days until a
                  place could be found for him.</p>
               <p>No place was ever sought, for Hetty, the year-old baby, took the management of the
                  case into her fat, dimpled hands, and clung to the orphan child with an affection
                  that allowed him no dwelling-place out of her reach. No arguments could have plead
                  for him like the fact that Hetty would cry to go to him the moment that he
                  appeared in sight, and would nestle contentedly in his arms, when no other person
                  could lure her from her mother's lap. So Mark stayed, and became as a son to the
                  kind-hearted couple who had so cordially accorded him a home by their fireside. He
                  was now a tall, stalwart young man, in his twenty-fourth year.</p>
               <p>It might have been the sad events of his childhood that gave a grave cast to his
                  character, and matured his intellect. He lived among thinking people, and in times
                  that well developed the thoughtfulness that was his prominent<pb n="52-53"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000026"/> inent trait. He had a few books that had belonged
                  to his father, and the deacon's collection furnished a few more.</p>
               <p>Young people would go without reading a long time in these days before they would
                  voluntarily go through the staid, sensible books of a Puritan library. Those were
                  sterling volumes, rich with the very marrow of thought. Not a book among them that
                  could rank among the countless milk-and-water works that now crowd the shelves of
                  juvenile as well as adult libraries. No one thought of spreading a couple of ideas
                  thin enough to make a thick book, or of smothering truth in a flimsy coating of
                  incident or romance. No. Facts were facts, and were relished as such, just as a
                  healthy appetite prefers plain bread and butter to fruit-cake and jellies.</p>
               <p>The political questions of the day were as familiar to Mark as to his elders. They
                  talked, but he listened. He understood the growing restiveness of the colonies
                  under British domination, and he read the stirring leaders in the newspapers until
                  their spirit became his own. Among the most inspiring of these were those written
                  by John Adams, whose clear commonsense and energy made him prominent.</p>
               <p>When Boston was shut up, and the Government and Custom-House removed by Governor
                  Gage to Salem, Mark read with enthusiastic pride how the Massachusetts patriots,
                  who, though legally chosen as representatives, were forbidden by the governor to
                  meet, scorned the prohibition, and when he would not organize the House, coolly
                  resolved themselves into a Provincial Congress, with John Hancock for president,
                  and dispatched business with such celerity that the armed British troops brought
                  to disperse them were too late to prevent their action.</p>
               <p>He gloried in the spirit of the American merchants who would not purchase English
                  goods, but reshipped the rich cargoes as soon as they were landed. In short, the
                  summer of 1774 found him, in spite of his habitually quiet manner, as bristling a
                  young patriot as the country could produce.</p>
               <p>All these opinions and feelings were shared by Hetty, who, in her girlish way, was
                  full of determination and bravery. Not that the perilous state of the country
                  sobered her in the least. She was as full of fun as ever, and resented as quickly
                  all attempts to steady her. Especially did it provoke her if Mark ventured to
                  advise or caution her. And it must be confessed that he showed very little tact in
                  assuming the office of mentor.</p>
               <p>They were sitting together on the wide back<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6508-00000027"
                  /> porch one evening, both engaged in shelling beans into a large pan that Hetty
                  held on her lap. The young man had taken advantage of this proximity to give a few
                  gentle hints on deportment, mixed with brotherly suggestions as to propriety in
                  general.</p>
               <p>Hetty listened silently to it all, but with a variety of expressions speaking from
                  every feature of her face. The dark eyes grew darker, the cheeks more crimson,
                  until Mark proceeded to a personal application of his remarks, when he was cut
                  short by Hetty taking the weapons of speech into her own service.</p>
               <p>"Mark Woodward, if you want to make me act as bad as ever I can, just keep on
                  preaching. Or, when you can't preach, just look at me as you did last Sunday when
                  I handed that billet to Bob Turner, because there is nothing in the world that
                  sets me a-going like that. If there's any blame about it, you are the one in
                  fault. You are the instigator, as Parson Smith says."</p>
               <p>The downright earnestness of Hetty puzzled Mark more than her speech.</p>
               <p>"I don't know what you mean, Hetty."</p>
               <p>"Of course you don't. You don't understand any thing about girls. You might prose
                  away at a boy about behavior and all the rest of it, and if he was pretty tame
                  himself, he mightn't think it stupid in you. But girls are different. Why, you
                  never begin to preach or look lectures but I am wild in a moment to cut up some
                  dido that will shock you all over? Do you understand that?"</p>
               <p>"No, I can't say I do."</p>
               <p>"Well, I didn't suppose you would. But really, Mark, it would be better for you to
                  look after your own manners instead of training mine. You wouldn't seem so
                  ridiculous, you know."</p>
               <p>"Ridiculous!"</p>
               <p>Mark was especially sensitive to ridicule, and Hetty knew it.</p>
               <p>"Yes. Do you remember the night that Nancy White and Joanna came over here to
                  sleep with me? the night," said Hetty demurely, "when father thumped on the wall
                  for us to keep still?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I remember."</p>
               <p>Mark smiled as he recollected the girlish laughter and screams of merriment that
                  had awakened the whole household in the middle of the night.</p>
               <p>"Now, Mark, what do you suppose we were laughing at?"</p>
               <p>"I haven't an idea."</p>
               <p>"No; of course not. I will tell you: I just put on some of your old clothes that
                  hung in the garret, and then I sat down in that great arm-chair by the window and
                  gave the girls<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6508-00000028"/> some good advice. When
                  they laughed, I looked at them like—well," said Hetty, "if I had been an owl or—or
                  a donkey, I couldn't have done it better."</p>
               <p>"Why, Hetty Bowen!" The young man's face flushed scarlet. "What possessed you to
                  do all that?"</p>
               <p>"O! I just wanted to see how good advice would affect them. So far as I could see,
                  it did not do them much good."</p>
               <p>"Was that what Nancy White was giggling about last Sunday noon when I met you over
                  in the burying-ground?"</p>
               <p>Hetty threw down the bean-pods in her hands, and laughed heartily before she
                  answered him:—</p>
               <p>"Not entirely. You looked so horrified, it was enough to make a hen giggle."</p>
               <p>"I had reason. It was the first time I ever saw a young woman sit down on a grave
                  to whistle."</p>
               <p>Hetty started, and her cheek paled.</p>
               <p>"Was it really a grave, Mark?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. All those hillocks are graves."</p>
               <p>"Well, it can't be helped now. They must be ages old, and there are no stones to
                  mark them. I didn't think of them at all, or of any other graves."</p>
               <p>"So I supposed."</p>
               <p>"As to the whistling, Nancy and I are practicing ticing together. I whistle
                  counter to her treble, and you would think it two flutes if you didn't know.
                  There, these tedious beans are shelled at last. If you will clear off the pods, I
                  will go up stairs now and practice a spell before dark, for there is nothing,"
                  said Miss Hetty gravely, "that so strengthens a whistle as the constant use of
                  it."</p>
               <p>Left to himself, Mark found himself giving vent to his dismay by a prolonged
                  whistle of his own. It was answered by an amused chuckle that came from the south
                  end of the stoop. Looking round, he saw the deacon sitting there on a rude bench,
                  evidently very much delighted with the dialogue that he had overheard.</p>
               <p>"Mark," said he, "the little girl is right about one thing. You do not understand
                  how to deal with her."</p>
               <p>"Yes; but I think she ought to understand me better," the young man answered. His
                  tone showed that he did not enjoy the situation, however agreeable it might seem
                  to the deacon. "I am only anxious for her welfare."</p>
               <p>"That is true, and the child knows it well enough. But she is just the right age
                  to be freaky and impatient of control. She is not exactly a child, Mark, and we
                  cannot call her a woman. A couple of years now will bring her out all right."</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6508-00000029"/>
               <p>"She is so reckless, Uncle Bowen. No one can tell what she will think of
                  doing."</p>
               <p>"Nothing really wicked, Mark. You can set your heart at rest about that. She has
                  sense enough, and a kind heart, too."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know all that. But she has been in my charge so much ever since she was a
                  baby that I cannot help feeling a kind of care of her now."</p>
               <p>"I am glad you do. I depend a great deal on your influence over her. But don't you
                  see that finding fault only stirs her up? It is just as she said. My wife was as
                  like her when she was young as two peas in a pod. She'll steady down if we just
                  give her time. And if you want to help her, my lad, just laugh with her."</p>
               <p>"That would be easy enough. It often seems impossible to keep sober."</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't try to. Isn't she a keen one, though?" asked the deacon admiringly.
                  "Clear mother, all over. Couldn't say any thing better of her."</p>
               <p>"Aunt Bowen always seems perfect to me," said Mark, smiling.</p>
               <p>"So she is; so she is; and little Hetty is another. You'll see it if you live. I
                  want you to join in her fancies, and humor them. Whistle with her, Mark, if she
                     <emph>will</emph> whistle," added the deacon, laughing aloud as a clear,
                  flute-like melody ody, not unlike a blue-bird's warble, sounded out on the still
                  evening air, and showed that Hetty was "practicing."</p>
               <p>Mark laughed too.</p>
               <p>"You see, my lad," said the deacon confidentially, "women are strange creturs, and
                  have to be managed advisedly. It wont do to bear down on the bit too hard; that
                  just puts the old scratch into them. But just give them their head, and they are
                  little short of being angels, that's a fact. Bless my soul! I wonder often what we
                  should do without them. You may set it down in your creed, Mark, that the best
                  policy in a family is to let a woman have her way. Not that any living man could
                  hinder it, but it makes things run smooth to agree to it."</p>
               <p>"All women are not like Aunt Bowen. There is Prudence Lincoln. What a life she
                  leads her husband!"</p>
               <p>"Well, the man is not worth being called a man, and Prudence knows it. Now, about
                  Hetty. She will be a woman soon, and we must not drive her off to strangers for
                  sympathy. There will be plenty of them hanging round or I'm mistaken. I could
                  mention several youngsters who have found out already that she is handsome. Now,
                  old folks can't be on the watch every-where; but she has always<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000030"/> looked upon you as a brother, and you can do more
                  for her than either her mother or I."</p>
               <p>Mark's face had crimsoned when the deacon alluded to the probability that Hetty
                  would attract admirers as she grew older. It was not a new idea. It certainly was
                  not an agreeable one to him.</p>
               <p>The common sense of the deacon's advice was apparent. He wondered that he had not
                  seen for himself that he had been lessening his influence over her. After that
                  evening he never volunteered either reproof or advice. Hetty watched him shyly for
                  a few days, and then came back to him with all the confidence of her childhood.
                  All her wild pranks were talked over in advance by them, and Mark helped carry
                  them out. But they gradually grew less and less in numbers, and more maidenly in
                  spirit. Time was developing the latent womanhood in her nature, and adding a
                  sweet, shy modesty to the wonderfully attractive beauty of the deacon's daughter.
                  And Mark began to look jealously upon the attentions of sundry young men who, in
                  the deacon's parlance, began "to hang round."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">AN ANCIENT TOWN.</head>
               <p>WHILE Hetty is passing through her unconscious transformation of character, we
                  will take a more definite view of her native place and its olden customs.</p>
               <p>There is, perhaps, no spot in New England more charming than the old town of
                  Weymouth. It is just a countless collection of sunny green hills overlooking
                  valleys of deeper verdure, with patches of woodland, and smooth, shadowy lake-lets
                  meeting the eye in every direction. Many of the rolling summits command every
                  variety of scenery, and when the summer sunset mellows the picture, or the morning
                  adds its fresh radiance to it, one might well mistake it for a veritable sketch of
                  fairy-land.</p>
               <p>Across the clear waters of the beautiful bay the fair city of Boston is clearly
                  seen on a fine day, the huge dome of the State House rising against the purple
                  sky.</p>
               <p>On the gleaming waters the white-winged ships, and more speedy, if less stately,
                  steamboats, are constantly passing and repassing, threading their steady way along
                  the crooked<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6508-00000031"/> channels among the lovely
                  islands that are set like emeralds upon the bosom of the sea.</p>
               <p>Weymouth is not only locally attractive, it is rich in historic lore. It was one
                  of the first towns settled in the "good old colony times." It was also settled by
                  the true-blue Puritan stock. These shrewd pioneers had a most charming creed of
                  human equality and fraternity; they disdained all earthly distinctions, but no
                  people on the earth were more exclusive or aristocratic in feeling.</p>
               <p>Their descendants inherit this feeling. Numerous families still delight to trace
                  their genealogy back to the shining lights of the colonial times. These can be
                  distinguished from the foreigner by an indescribable air of complacent
                  superiority. Among the crowds that have drifted in from other countries they hold
                  their heads erect, with a consciousness of their glorious parentage stiffening
                  every joint in their backbones.</p>
               <p>Weymouth, with its thriving villages nestling in the valleys and crowning the
                  hill-tops; with its immense iron works; with its extensive boot and shoe
                  manufactories; its railways, and the evidences of busy industry on every hand; its
                  goodly display of churches and school-houses, bears little resemblance to the
                  olden Weymouth of Hetty's time.</p>
               <p>Yet its local characteristics are the same. The same beautiful sheets of water
                  reflect the unchanged azure of the sky; and the narrow rivers, though old in
                  years, still keep the freshness and sparkle of their youth, flashing out among the
                  rocks and woods in tiny cascades, or more quietly traversing the green hollows
                  down to the sea. The changes seen are the work of man—not wrought out by the
                  never-hurried hand of the Creator.</p>
               <p>In the olden times, one long road stretched itself like a giant snake from the
                  north to the south end of the town. Branching from this was a road leading through
                  Braintree (which then embraced Quincy in its township) to Boston, the seat of the
                  Government. Another branch led to the romantic town of Hingham, which then had the
                  decidedly English look that marks it now.</p>
               <p>Hingham was laid out in regular streets, planted on either side with the trees
                  whose magnificent growth still adorns and shades them. But Weymouth was never laid
                  out at all. It grew according to its own sweet will, and no modern skill has ever
                  attempted to reduce it to order. Its early beauty is undimmed, and still retains
                  the charm of naturalness. It has scarcely a look of relationship to its prim
                  neighbor, and (we may as well confess<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6508-00000032"/> it)
                  a little straightening and finish would not hurt it. The numerous visitors from
                  the cities who spend the summer in the delightful retreats of Hingham all testify
                  to the exquisite loveliness of its scenery, and also to the refinement and culture
                  of its inhabitants.</p>
               <p>But we will fancy ourselves living in Hetty's time and in her home in Weymouth. On
                  a clear summer day we will saunter leisurely along the long road, and look well
                  about us. There are mullein stalks, and yarrow, and Mayweed growing thriftily of
                  their own accord among the grasses that carpet the wide margin of the street, and
                  occasional bunches of thistles hold up their crimson brushes full of the downy
                  seeds that the farmer dreads. The homely tansy and rough horse-radish crowd up to
                  the edges of the cultivated gardens, where they are tolerated because of their
                  medicinal properties.</p>
               <p>The farm-houses are scattered along at intervals of a quarter or half mile. Some
                  of them are painted red, some brown; but oftener they are unpainted by any hand
                  save the invisible agency of the sun and the winds, which gradually bring out that
                  purplish wood-tint that is so beautiful among the green setting of the surrounding
                  trees. The small high windows are of diamond-shaped glass. Over many of them hang
                  the brilliant scarlet blossoms of the flowering bean, or the more delicate cups of
                  the morning-glory.</p>
               <p>In the front yard we see that time-honored favorite among flowers, the lilac, or
                  "laylock" as our great-grandmothers called it. Close by its side are untrained
                  thickets of the fragrant cinnamon-rose, whose carefully picked leaves are
                  distilled into eye-washes, or used as flavors in cooking, or strewed with lavender
                  among the folds of the ever-accumulating linen in the big chests and presses.
                  There are bright beds of pinks and poppies, and yellow marigolds half as big as
                  their sisters, the sunflowers, whose great golden heads are leaning over the
                  garden wall. We have no hollyhocks in our time that begin to equal those ancient
                  ones, that, after flourishing with marvelous brilliance in the ornamental line,
                  bethought themselves of their capacity for usefulness, and were soberly stewed
                  down into healing salves and ointments.</p>
               <p>But, O! what <emph>homes</emph> there were in those plain farm-houses and their
                  environs! Homes that could not be crowded into the house, but extended over every
                  inch of land owned by the family. Homes that embraced the barns and corn-houses,
                  the hay-stacks and wood-piles, and even took in the quaint, skeleton-looking
                  cider-mills that graced many of the door-yards.</p>
               <p>The cider-mills was an "institution." Prompt<pb n="66-67"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000033"/> to wait upon its grinding came the children with
                  slips of clean straw, through which they drew rich draughts of the sweet,
                  unfermented juices of the orchard. The elders came, too, though their mature taste
                  preferred the cider when it was worked "just enough to be good." In the great
                  kitchen the women boiled it down for apple-sauce and mince-pies. No one thought of
                  keeping house without it; and if the minister had happened to oppose its use in
                  those days, broaching for the purpose <emph>our</emph> exclusive temperance
                  theories, he would have been considered demented by the whole parish, and a
                  colleague would have been forthwith provided.</p>
               <p>There was one quiet nook in the house—one corner that was never home to any body.
                  It was the "spare room," which was kept shut up, except on the rare occasions of a
                  wedding or a funeral. Sometimes it was opened to visitors for a few hours, but the
                  guests were sure to escape from its funereal dignity to the light, airy rooms
                  "where the folks lived." Like the costlier elegance of company parlors now, the
                  spare room shut out all real comfort.</p>
               <p>Hetty and her mother might be taken as samples of the other farmers' wives and
                  daughters. They wore linsey-woolsey short-gowns and petticoats of their own
                  manufacture, and spun and wove all the cloth used in the house. They were in no
                  respect behind the men folks in active labors. On the contrary, when the deacon's
                  day's work was done, and he sat quietly resting in his arm-chair by the door or
                  the fireside—when Mark, after seeing to the outdoor chores, regaled himself with
                  the perusal of Cotton Mather's "Essays to Do Good," or some heavy work of New
                  England divinity, the good wife and her daughter never dreamed of the possibility
                  of resting before bed-time. They only sought by a change of employment to relieve
                  the overtasked muscles of the body. "Don't ask your father to bring a pail of
                  water," Mistress Bowen would say; "he is tired." There was considerable variety in
                  what was especially regarded as women's work. The wool-cards, hatchels, and
                  flax-brakes had a separate use of their own, which preceded the spinning and
                  weaving; and no house was furnished until a huge cheese-press, nearly as big as
                  the loom, was provided. Butter-making was a thing of course, as much as the
                  never-ending cooking that the appetites of sturdy working-men demanded.</p>
               <p>For a little time in the evening all these kinds of work were laid aside, but
                  still there was no rest for the women. Just as likely as not they had been called
                  out during the day to help get the nicely-made hay into the barn,<pb n="68-69"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000034"/> before a threatening shower should spoil it. If you
                  have ever helped to "hurry up" a haycrop in this way, you can form some idea of
                  the heat and fatigue of such a job.</p>
               <p>All the heavy work—that is, heavy women's work—had to be supplemented by sewing,
                  mending, and the knitting—the endless knitting. The young women were bent upon
                  showing that proof of their fitness for marriage—a pillow-slip full of stockings
                  of their own manufacture. The matrons were "toeing and heeling" for the
                  irrepressible boys. Even the old grandmothers did not rest. The trembling hands
                  were always knitting. It was such easy work; in very truth, far easier to the worn
                  hands than idleness. It made the loving old heart contented, and gave no room to
                  the terrible idea of being useless, that embitters old age too often now.
                  Grandmother's long, warm stockings never came amiss as a present to son or
                  grandson.</p>
               <p>We don't seem to have many grandmothers since our stockings are knitted by
                  machinery. The next generation will have none; for who can imagine a real
                  grandmother without her knitting and snuff-box? To see her knit leisurely round to
                  the seam-stitch, so as to double her work evenly for the measurement, which is so
                  needless to her practiced eye, and then from the unknown depths of her pocket
                  bring up the fragrant box, tap the lid before opening, with true hospitality pass
                  it round the circle of neighbors, and then lean back composedly to enjoy her own
                  bountiful pinch, is to see a grandmother.</p>
               <p>When our young ladies who never learned to knit shall grow old, what can they do
                  to make their presence valued in the corner? The dim eyes will not be able to
                  count the endless stitches of the crotchet or embroidery patterns that now waste
                  their hours, even supposing that the mind should not outgrow its liking for
                  trivial pursuits.</p>
               <p>The stories that we used to hear with such breathless attention are always
                  associated in our memories with the ceaseless click of the knitting-needles. The
                  bright needle-case, and the network bag which held the round balls of yarn, were
                  marvels of art to us. The soft evenness of the work was in discouraging contrast
                  to our own childish handiwork, which had to be often raveled out and knitted over
                  because the meshes were too lightly drawn, or, alas! because with scant patience
                  we had hurriedly widened or narrowed the stocking out of its proper shape. O, the
                  infinite endurance of the grandmothers who helped us wind the crinkled yarn anew,
                  and set up the foundation stitches afresh for another<pb n="70-71"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000035"/> effort! O the loving appreciation of the
                  grandmothers when at last the work grew into a form that gave a hint of its use,
                  and we had fairly conquered the mysteries of binding the heel and goring the
                  instep!</p>
               <p>But we have a controversy with the grandmothers, for to them we owe the physical
                  degeneration of women. It is nonsense to throw the blame of this upon the "women
                  of the period," or even upon their mothers. It does not belong to them. It dates
                  back to those ante-revolutionary times, and rests upon the shoulders and
                  consciences of our great-grandmothers. What right had they to expend in ceaseless
                  labors the muscular energy and nervous vigor that should have been transmitted to
                  their offspring? They robbed us of the richest part of our inheritance—ignorantly
                  it is true, but really all the same. It was their endless toil that unfits us for
                  ordinary toil. Our legion of weaknesses and ailments naturally result from their
                  exhausted powers. Look at our frail, delicate women, with narrow shoulders, flat
                  chests, slender figures, and no stamina, joined to minds of preternatural
                  activity. To be sure there are many whose intellects are dwarfed as well as their
                  bodies, especially if it is their misfortune to be fashionably reared. Not ten in
                  a hundred of them are fit for wives and mothers, and their beauty fades so early
                  that they are not worth much as toys. These all had smart grandmothers, you may be
                  sure of that. And these pattern old ladies used up the vitality that belonged to
                  several generations. They do not deserve either thanks or credit for it at our
                  hands. And the wiseacres who reproach us for our feebleness might as well blame us
                  for not possessing the money spent by our ancestors.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">INDICATIONS OF A STORM.</head>
               <p>IT was a warm noontime in September—just noon by the infallible sun-mark in the
                  south window of the farm kitchen. The morning had been damp and misty, but the
                  sea-fog had given up the unequal struggle with the sun, and left him a clear field
                  to operate in. It had retired royally, rolling up in its silvery banners great
                  sheets of brilliant rainbows as it swept gracefully back to its ocean home.</p>
               <p>The dinner-table was ready laid in the kitchen, for punctuality was one of the
                  good wife's virtues, and Mark and the hired-man sat by the door waiting; or,
                  rather, the hired-man was waiting, for Mark had a faculty for using the spare
                  moments, and the weekly newspaper lay handily on the window-sill.</p>
               <p>The boiled dinner of corned beef, flanked with a huge platter of cabbage and
                  kindred vegetables, was smoking on the table, joining its mixed flavors to the
                  sweet smell of delicious corn-bread just taken from the oven. Everybody was ready
                  to eat, excepting the deacon, who had not yet come in from the field.</p>
               <p>No one thought of beginning the meal without him. In those days people did not sit
                  down to eat without asking a blessing on the feast, and no other member of the
                  deacon's household ever thought of attempting the long grace, which comprehended
                  more of petition and thanksgiving than most modern prayers. It was never spoken
                  hurriedly. The members of the family stood around the table reverently, while the
                  deacon, with outspread hands and bowed head, implored the heavenly benediction.
                  There was no burning of tongues or throats with scalding viands, for every thing
                  was just cool enough to be eaten with comfort when the "Amen" was reached.</p>
               <p>This was the ordinary course of things. Today, a really cold dinner seemed to be
                  in prospect—a thing unknown in all of Mistress Bowen's previous housekeeping.</p>
               <p>"I don't see what on earth has become of the deacon. Where did you leave him?"</p>
               <p>Mark was lost in a spirited protest against the growing oppression of the British
                  Government, and she had to repeat the question before he heard it.</p>
               <p>"There is no use in talking to Mark," said Miss Hetty. "He is deaf and dumb if he
                  sees a book or paper."</p>
               <p>Mark's literary tastes were not appreciated<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6508-00000037"
                  /> by the bright-faced maiden, who liked talking much better than reading.</p>
               <p>"Not quite so bad as that, Hetty," he answered smiling. "I left Uncle Bowen down
                  by the bars at the foot of the lane. He saw Peter Humphreys coming down the road,
                  and stopped to speak with him. Humphreys was in Boston yesterday."</p>
               <p>"The dinner will be spoiled, Mark."</p>
               <p>"Will it?" Mark answered absently, his mind again absorbed in the paper. The
                  dinner was evidently of little moment in his sight.</p>
               <p>Hetty thought differently. With a glance at her mother that spoke volumes of
                  impatience, she took down the great tin horn which was kept to summon the
                  men-folks in any case of special emergency, and stepping out on the back piazza,
                  or stoop, as it was called, she blew such a rousing blast that the echoes on the
                  farther side of King Oak Hill were stirred up, and filled all the region with
                  their clear-voiced mockeries. Mark threw down his paper with a start, and her
                  mother, though laughing heartily at the shrill clamor, was fain to stop her
                  ears.</p>
               <p>"There!" exclaimed the young damsel as she hung up her "lyre" upon its accustomed
                  nail; "I guess that'll fetch him, if he is anywhere in town."</p>
               <p>"I should think it might," said Mark. "But here he is close at hand. You see your
                  trumpeting was not needed."</p>
               <p>The deacon's face was very grave as he came in. This, since the serious
                  complication of public affairs, was no uncommon expression, and his wife, mindful
                  of the fast-cooling dinner, forbore to ask any questions until they were seated
                  around the table. Then, in answer to her inquiring looks, he said:—</p>
               <p>"I met Humphreys down the road, and stopped to ask the news from town. He says
                  there is great suffering there. Nearly all the people are compelled to be idle,
                  and very few have any means of support. It is too bad, too bad. Provisions ought
                  to be sent in from every farm in the country."</p>
               <p>"The newspaper states that contributions of both money and provisions have been
                  sent to Boston from all the colonies. There is a widespread sympathy felt for the
                  sufferers."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mark. But they need a steady supply. The corn that they ate last week wont
                  nourish them to-day. We don't want them to fast. It is a common cause, and we
                  ought to share its consequences with them."</p>
               <p>"I think so, too," responded his wife.</p>
               <p>"That abominable Port bill is at the bottom of the mischief."</p>
               <p>"There are several other things at the bottom,<pb n="76-77"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000038"/> I think," said Mark, his eyes flashing ominously;
                  "but these domineering English will find that some of them will rise to the top.
                  They seem to be sure of their power to crush us. They have forgotten which side
                  beat on the Government Stamped Paper question."</p>
               <p>"And the settlement of the tea <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fracas</foreign> also. Eh,
                  Mark!" added the deacon, laughing.</p>
               <p>Now, it had so happened that Mark had been visiting his aunt and cousins in Boston
                  at the time of the historic tea-party in Boston harbor, and it was shrewdly
                  suspected that he had attended that party.</p>
               <p>"Closing up the port is as great an imposition as either," remarked the young man.
                  "The people wont bear such things long. I should like to be where I could listen
                  to that council of delegates in Philadelphia."</p>
               <p>"Adams is there. He will not be afraid to speak out."</p>
               <p>"If he should be, another man would soon take his place. The people are in
                  earnest."</p>
               <p>"John Adams is as true as steel. I haven't a doubt about him. Do you remember,
                  wife, when he first came to see the minister's daughter? How the folks talked! We
                  all thought he was looking a little too high for a poor boy. Only the son of a
                  small farmer."</p>
               <p>"He was a lawyer, father."</p>
               <p>"Well, that made the matter worse. We can hardly believe them honest now, but then
                  lawyers were supposed to be altogether too tricky. But Adams is all right, and in
                  Philadelphia he will need all his law knowledge."</p>
               <p>"I suppose," said Mark thoughtfully," that the young men about here might be
                  getting ready to serve their country in case they are needed. We might start an
                  independent company of volunteers, and train once a week. And we could practice
                  shooting at a target an hour every day."</p>
               <p>"Why, Mark!" exclaimed Hetty, "one would think we were really going to war."</p>
               <p>"It will come to that, you may depend. Our thick-headed rulers will drive us to it
                  at last. They talk now of 'punishing' us. It will be a dear job for them if they
                  try it."</p>
               <p>"Humphreys hasn't a grain of courage," remarked the deacon. "I mean the old man,
                  not Joe; though there is little to choose between them in that respect. He talks
                  about the power of England very much as Parson Smith does about the power of God.
                  Her authority is something sacred to him. Joe came up while we were talking. What
                  a conceited young jack-ass he is!"</p>
               <p>Mark sent an amused glance across the table to Hetty. The admiration of the "young
                     jackass<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6508-00000039"/> ass" for that fair maiden was
                  the talk of the neighborhood, but the deacon had not suspected it. He noticed
                  Mark's expression at first with a puzzled face, and then with a glimmer of
                  intelligence breaking over his countenance. He paused in eating his dinner, with
                  his fork poised half way to his mouth, then pondered silently a moment, noting
                  angrily as he did so the blushes that his own steady gaze brought to Hetty's
                  cheeks.</p>
               <p>"Mehetabel, wasn't Joe Humphreys here last Sunday evening?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"And for two Sunday evenings before that?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"What does he come here <emph>for?</emph>" thundered the deacon. No one in that
                  house had ever heard the good man's voice raised so savagely. Hetty was not
                  frightened in the least. A mischievous smile lurked about the corners of her
                  mouth, and shone in her eyes.</p>
               <p>"Why, father, don't you know? He comes to sing. He sings tenor so
                  beautifully."</p>
               <p>Now, if there was any thing on earth that every body considered thoroughly
                  ridiculous, it was Joe Humphreys' tenor. He had a little squeaking voice not
                  unlike the initiatory crowing of a young rooster.</p>
               <p>"O father!" said Hetty, "you ought to hear him sing 'David's Lament.' It is
                  enough—enough to bring Absalom to life again."</p>
               <p>The stern expression faded from the deacon's face. He burst into a hearty laugh.
                  "You sly witch," he said pleasantly, as soon as he could speak. "I'll risk you.
                  That pesky little Tory will have to change his tune, tenor and all, if he wants to
                  stand well in this house. Eh, Hetty?"</p>
               <p>"He is <emph>so</emph> handsome, father," said Hetty, demurely.</p>
               <p>"Handsome is that handsome does," responded the deacon, his face again wrinkling
                  into a frown. "I have no opinion of him—or any other traitor."</p>
               <p>"La sakes, father," said his wife anxiously, "Hetty don't mean any thing. I
                  wouldn't get into such a heat, if I were you, for all the Humphreys in
                  creation."</p>
               <p>"Well, mother," answered the deacon frankly, "I guess you are about right. It
                  don't pay very well. That's a fact. And it don't alter any thing to fret over it.
                  But I declare," warming up again, "it riles me up clear to the bottom to hear such
                  stuff. That sneaking Joe," with a glance in Hetty's direction, "is wiser in his
                  own conceit than seven men that can render a reason."</p>
               <p>"That is true enough," assented his wife<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6508-00000040"/>
                  soothingly, "but I'd let him alone and eat my dinner, if I were you."</p>
               <p>"If he didn't go over all that outrageous nonsense about our obligations to
                  England, as though," said the deacon angrily, "I was about ten years old, and
                  needed to be instructed. 'The old country had given us her protection, and we were
                  trying to return the kindness by ingratitude and rebellion.' Pretty talk, I must
                  say."</p>
               <p>"But, father," said Hetty, "if he thinks so—"</p>
               <p>"He doesn't think so. He aint quite a fool—very near it, though. Humphreys knows,
                  and Joe <emph>might</emph> know, if he was capable of knowing any thing, that it
                  was the tyranny and oppression of the old country that drove out our colonists
                  from their homes there. There's protection for you! Don't we know what they
                  suffered in starting new homes in the wilderness here? England never paid a penny
                  toward supporting the children that she turned out of doors. They had to earn
                  their own living, and pay her for the privilege. Dreadful affectionate she was as
                  soon as they got a little forehanded. All ready to share in the profits, and live
                  on our labor."</p>
               <p>"Never mind it now. I wouldn't lose my dinner," advised practical Mr. Bowen.</p>
               <p>"I tell you that the silliest thing the Pilgrims ever did was to offer their
                  allegiance to a government that had treated them so shabbily. They must have
                  enjoyed abasing themselves better than I do. <emph>I</emph> don't like to eat
                  humble-pie."</p>
               <p>"No. But you like squash-pie. And here is the first one I have baked this
                  season."</p>
               <p>Again the deacon laughed as he noticed his wife's persistent efforts to divert his
                  attention. "It is a capital pie," he said, tasting it; "it is a proof that I
                  married a good cook."</p>
               <p>"Is it? Hetty made it."</p>
               <p>"It is all the same. Like mother, like daughter."</p>
               <p>The old grandfather had been silently listening to the coversation, his usually
                  vacant look changing to one of piteous appeal when the deacon referred to the old
                  times. It stirred anew the memories of those early troubles.</p>
               <p>"Matthew," said he, earnestly, "thank God for the liberty of free worship."</p>
               <p>Matthew was the old man's first-born son, and he had been dead forty years.</p>
               <p>"Yes, father," responded the deacon cheerily, "we will thank God." Then, in an
                  undertone: "Precious little thanks do we owe England for that. Mark, what sort of
                  fellows are your Boston cousins? Good Whigs?"</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6508-00000041"/>
               <p>"Well, you can judge for yourself. They went to the tea-party."</p>
               <p>"Did they? I have been thinking, mother, that we ought to help some of them.
                  Suppose we send a load of provisions to Mark's cousins. Meat and corn and
                  vegetables, and such like."</p>
               <p>"It is a good idea. Wonder we never thought of it before. I can spare some butter
                  and cheese just as well as not."</p>
               <p>"Can you go in with a load to-morrow, Mark? That is, if we can get up soon enough
                  to give you an early start. I was going to use both horses, but I will manage to
                  do with one."</p>
               <p>"He may take Sylph," said Hetty.</p>
               <p>It was a standing rule that her horse should not be put to hard work, and her
                  father looked at her in surprise.</p>
               <p>"Take Sylph!" he repeated.</p>
               <p>"Yes. She will draw well if Mark is with her. He can make her do any thing. When
                  the war begins I shall give her to him, and she may as well begin to serve her
                  country."</p>
               <p>A bright, pleased look spread over her father's face. "Well done, Hetty! That's
                  the right kind of talk. There is no nasty Tory blood in you; you've got the true
                  grit in you; take it from your mother," added the deacon, who never omitted any
                  opportunity to praise his wife.</p>
               <p>It was no small task to load the long wagon, or cart, with provisions. In the
                  midst of all was a box full of home-made flannels, and blue woolen cloth for
                  "men's wear." Long winter stockings, that had been knitted on purpose for the
                  deacon and Mark, were snugly tucked into the corners.</p>
               <p>"Time enough to look out for ourselves before cold weather. Hetty and I both knit
                  as fast as any women in the land," said Mrs. Bowen as she packed them
                  securely.</p>
               <p>When all was ready, Hetty went out to pat Sylph and bid her good-bye. The sun was
                  just rising over the hills, and there was not a cloud in the sky.</p>
               <p>"The day was made on purpose for your journey, Mark. I wish I were going,
                  too."</p>
               <p>"I wish you were," he answered; "but I'll be home early in the evening, and tell
                  you all about it."</p>
               <p>Mark saw one curious sight that day in Boston which would have rejoiced the hearts
                  of the "women's-rights women" if they had been there to see.</p>
               <p>The great scarcity of coffee and sugar was severely felt by all classes of the
                  patriots, and it was rumored that a wealthy but close-fisted merchant had a
                  hogshead of coffee in his store, which he refused to sell under six shillings per
                  pound. He was a crusty old bachelor, and the<pb n="84-85"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000042"/> women of that period had the same kind of respect
                  toward that species of animal that is common now. So about a hundred of them
                  assembled with a tip-cart and trucks before the City Hall, and marched down to his
                  warehouse. On arriving there they demanded the keys, which he refused to deliver.
                  Upon this one of them, a stout woman, in a short gray gown and blue petticoat,
                  seized him by the neck and tossed him into the cart.</p>
               <p>Finding that he could not help himself, he delivered up the keys, when they tipped
                  up the cart and discharged him. It was rather an ignoble way of helping him from a
                  carriage, but it is doubtful if the strong-minded daughters of those fearless
                  women could improve upon it. It was reported, Mark said, that they gave him a good
                  whipping to raise his spirits, but the crowd prevented his seeing if it were
                  done.</p>
               <p>After disposing of the bachelor, the women opened the warehouse, hoisted out the
                  sugar and coffee themselves, put it into the truck, and drove off. A large
                  concourse of men were the amazed but silent spectators of this feminine
                  performance. There was a general feeling among them that he was served about
                  right.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE WOMEN OF THE OLDEN TIME.</head>
               <p>THE autumn passed slowly by, bringing the fruitful harvest and the later
                  brilliance of the frost-painted woods. Nature worked on quietly and thoroughly,
                  forgetting nothing until the winter's robe of snow was spread over hill and
                  valley, and the rivers were bound securely in their fetters of ice.</p>
               <p>A winter in New England, as a general thing, means winter. There is no humbug
                  about it. It musters its forces in good season, and maintains its ground
                  vigorously until the genial glow of the summer fairly forces it to retreat. As for
                  spring, it is a foreign institution that has never taken root here. Our native
                  poets know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Quiet as the country looked, it was in a ferment politically. The people in and
                  around Boston were wide awake to the dangers threatening them from the arrogance
                  of the mother-country, and a growing disposition to maintain their rights pervaded
                  the entire community.</p>
               <p>In Weymouth Mark had found no difficulty<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6508-00000043"/>
                  in raising a respectable company of volunteers, who "trained" every Saturday
                  afternoon, under the direction of an old soldier who had served in the wars with
                  the French. He was well posted in military tactics, and it was the one delight of
                  his life to go through the practice with the enthusiastic youngsters, who
                  scrupulously followed his minutest directions.</p>
               <p>Other companies were organized all over the country. The fire of patriotism was
                  steadily burning, and gaining strength daily from the very efforts made to
                  extinguish it. The English and their Tory adherents looked on with undisguised
                  contempt.</p>
               <p>"It will take but one broadside from the regulars to disperse the whole set of
                  rebels," said Joe Humphreys to Hetty. They were standing at the deacon's front
                  door watching the maneuvers of the little company.</p>
               <p>"Time will tell a different story," said Hetty.</p>
               <p>"You'll see. The governor will attend to these matters as soon as he thinks they
                  are big enough to make trouble. It looks like children's play to him. You see he
                  knows his own strength."</p>
               <p>"If I had a grain of common sense I would use it. I wonder at you, Joe."</p>
               <p>"He has all England to back him up, and there isn't a country on earth that can
                  lick England gland. Now, what's the use of a new country like ours spunking up? We
                  only bite our own noses off."</p>
               <p>"I advise you to keep clear of father if you are determined to be a Tory."</p>
               <p>"I aint afraid of any body."</p>
               <p>"No; because you think father is a deacon, and so is bound to keep the peace. But
                  I wouldn't venture too far."</p>
               <p>"Honestly, Hetty, don't you think Mark and the rest of them are foolish to rear up
                  so about nothing? The first you know they will get up a fight somewhere, and then
                  we shall be in a fine fix. Strange that some folks never know when they are well
                  off."</p>
               <p>"Why don't you read the papers, Joe, and find out something about the matter? I
                  never read much till lately, but Mark has read to us evenings till mother and I
                  are as interested in the speeches of our delegates in Congress as father is. If
                  you knew a little more, Joe, it wouldn't hurt you."</p>
               <p>"I know too much to burn my fingers for nothing."</p>
               <p>The Humphreys were the nearest neighbors, and, for that reason, the deacon's
                  family tried hard to keep up a kind, neighborly feeling toward them, even
                  tolerating the frequent visits and empty boasts of Joe for the sake of peace.<pb
                     n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6508-00000044"/> But Hetty's patience was fast leaving
                  her. She had not a large stock of that grace naturally, and Joe was using it up
                  much too prodigally for his own interest.</p>
               <p>"Father says he sha'n't take up on either side," said Joe. "If other folks want to
                  quarrel, they can; but he is going to mind his own business. I call that sensible,
                  anyhow. My sakes, Hetty, don't Mark hold his head up! He thinks he shall be
                  major-general yet!"</p>
               <p>Hetty was already watching Mark, and she had not failed to note the manly bearing
                  that had attracted Joe's attention.</p>
               <p>"Pretty considerable uppish," continued Joe, "seeing as he was raised on
                  charity!"</p>
               <p>A sharp retort rose to the girl's lips, but she did not speak. There was no need
                  of words. The deepened color in her cheeks and the angry flash of her eyes were
                  sufficiently eloquent, and when she turned abruptly and shut the door in his face,
                  Joe understood that he had ventured a step too far.</p>
               <p>"Wal," he said, "I guess it wont do her any hurt to know how that fellow's high
                  ways strike other people. They're a bright set, all of them, to be marching round
                  in this snow. I'd like to see them scatter before a company of regulars. Mark
                  wanted me to join them. Don't catch me in that way. Think a plaguey sight too much
                  of my neck to venture it for nothing. I guess I'll go home."</p>
               <p>No one appearing to oppose this conclusion, Joe went home.</p>
               <p>We all understand by this time that our Hetty was not what in our time would be
                  called an accomplished young lady. She had plenty of education, more than girls
                  get now, but no schooling. She was brought up in the retirement of the home
                  circle, and never in her life attended any school for learning.</p>
               <p>Mark had been her teacher so far as books were concerned, and by ceaseless efforts
                  had made her a tolerable proficient in such knowledge as was really necessary in
                  her position.</p>
               <p>The prevailing ideas in regard to education, especially female education, were
                  limited in the first families to a knowledge of reading, writing, and arithmetic.
                  In very rare cases, where the Puritan objection to amusements was not too strong,
                  the young women were taught music and dancing.</p>
               <p>But, however little of purely secular learning was allowed, the young minds were
                  all carefully grounded in religious doctrines. The great end of study was to
                  expound the Holy Scriptures, and any other intellectual pursuit was rather
                  accidental than of direct intention. Polemics were looked upon in the light of
                  recreation, and<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6508-00000045"/> the study of dialectics
                  was pursued with the keenest zest, as affording weapons for religious warfare—that
                  is, for controversy. The Puritan babies were not born with arguments in their
                  mouths, but they soon learned to value them far above sugar-plums.</p>
               <p>There was in the masculine mind the same fear of feminine progress that
                  distinguishes many of the lights of our time. They clearly saw the danger of
                  allowing women to meddle with arguments too high for their comprehension. It was
                  believed that the abstruse doctrines which then, <emph>as now,</emph> utterly
                  confounded the intellects of the sterner sex were too perilous for the handling of
                  women, The men let off all the wisdom that they could safely venture, and the
                  women received it silently in all subjection.</p>
               <p>No woman aspired to the learned professions, yet they did not scruple to engage in
                  any business that was honest and profitable. Much of what was properly men's work
                  was done by them before the Revolution, and when the struggle was in progress,
                  labor of all kinds necessarily came into their hands.</p>
               <p>The wife of Dr. Franklin helped him much by her industry and frugality. They kept
                  no servant, and all the labors of the house-keeping were performed by her. In
                  addition to this, she assisted her husband in his work, folded and stitched the
                  pamphlets, kept shop, and bought the rags to be made into paper. It is probable
                  that very many of the wise saws that have made Poor Richard famous were suggested
                  by her practical good sense, and appropriated without scruple by the philosopher.
                  For his temporal success he was indebted to her assistance and management.</p>
               <p>Franklin once had a branch printing-office in Charleston, South Carolina. It was
                  in charge of a journeyman printer, who had not long established it before he was
                  taken sick and died. He, too, had a wife capable of managing for herself. She took
                  the business into her own hands, and carried it on so prosperously that when her
                  son grew up she was able to buy the office for him with what she had saved.
                  American history has never undertaken to do justice to the ability and influence
                  of women. Its heroes are trained by the domestic hearth-side; the mother's wise
                  but gentle hands have molded the character of the renowned chieftain or skillful
                  ruler, but she who cultivated the mind and instructed the heart is forgotten.</p>
               <p>One is particularly struck with this fact in endeavoring to obtain some memorials
                  of the heroic women who lived in New England at the time of the Revolution. There
                  are absolutely<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6508-00000046"/> no records to be found in
                  regard to them. Excepting the vague traditions that our grandmothers delight to
                  repeat to us, their memories have passed into oblivion. Scarcely a century ago
                  they were living characters upon the stage, showing in their daily lives the most
                  wonderful courage, patience, and fortitude. Now their names are forgotten, and
                  their share in securing the liberties that we enjoy will never be
                  acknowledged.</p>
               <p>Of their predecessors we know scarcely any thing. Cotton Mather, in his huge, dull
                  volumes, is somewhat minute in his descriptions of the toads, and frogs, and the
                  other reptiles of the new country, but he says little of the women, except in a
                  general way to signify his approval of burning them as witches.</p>
               <p>We have almost forgotten Hetty in this digression. When she left Joe Humphreys at
                  the door and returned to her work of spinning in the kitchen, there was an angry
                  light in her eyes that attracted her mother's attention at once.</p>
               <p>"What is it, child? What is the matter?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, mother dear."</p>
               <p>"Nothing!"</p>
               <p>"Well, it was Joe, and he is as near nothing as he can be and live."</p>
               <p>"What has he said to vex you now?</p>
               <p>"Only flinging out about the soldiers and about Mark. He says Mark was raised on
                  charity."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bowen was vigorously carding a pile of white wool rolls preparatory to
                  spinning them, but she stopped in her work and answered Joe's taunt as indignantly
                  as if she had been addressing himself.</p>
               <p>"If Joe Humphreys lives to be a hundred years old, he will never get off a bigger
                  lie than that. Charity! From the day the poor orphan came home here until this
                  blessed morning, he has been a help and a comfort. If he had been my own son, he
                  could not have done more for me. And your father depends on him in every thing.
                  Charity! I wonder what the deacon will say to that?"</p>
               <p>"He'll say that Joe's talk isn't worth our minding. But he is very provoking."</p>
               <p>"He takes a curious way to get your favor, Hetty."</p>
               <p>"O! as to that, mother, we've been always quarreling off and on, ever since I can
                  remember. It don't amount to any thing."</p>
               <p>"I wish," said Hetty's mother, with a side-look at the girl's flushed face, "I
                  really wish he would not come over here so much. What do you suppose possesses him
                  to be over here every Sunday night?"</p>
               <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6508-00000047"/>
               <p>Hetty laughed. "Why, mother dear, I should think you might understand. He is so
                  foppish, and he has on his Sunday clothes, and wants to show them off. He is too
                  lazy to go any farther, and besides," said Hetty demurely, "I praise up his
                  rigging till he is just about tickled to death."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bowen laughed heartily. "He is a neighbor," she said, "and I suppose we must
                  put up with him. This is the last day of training for the soldiers, isn't it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; unless the snow goes off. Do you really suppose, mother, that the country
                  will ever need them?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot tell. Your father thinks, and so does Mark, that we have a long and
                  terrible civil war in prospect."</p>
               <p>"I wish I were a man, mother, to help fight it."</p>
               <p>The mother looked fondly into the girl's flushed face. "I can't say, Hetty, that I
                  wish that. You are all we have, child, and I am thankful that you will not be in
                  such dangers and toils as the soldiers must suffer. But if the war comes, as your
                  father thinks, you may be sure, Hetty, that the women will find plenty to
                  do—plenty to do."</p>

               <head type="sub">A SMALL SPECIMEN.</head>
               <p>JOE HUMPHREYS was the youngest and the smallest in a family of nine children. All
                  the rest were girls, and they were all large and robust enough to pass well for
                  men. As they grew up they took hold of the out-door work on the farm, and managed
                  haying, planting, and harvesting, as skillfully as if they had been brought up in
                  a Woman's Rights Convention. When Joe came, a wee mite of a shaver in spite of his
                  lordly sex, the eight sisters as well as the delighted parents received him as a
                  blessing directly from the Lord. There were never too many children in the
                  old-time homes. The old-fashioned mothers had plenty of room in their arms and
                  hearts for all the little ones, and she was proudest and happiest whose fire-side
                  was crowded with them. When children went out of fashion, a great deal of domestic
                  happiness went with them. The purest bliss of earth was scorned and lost. The
                  ancient dames gloried especially in their motherhood. They believed that God made
                  them on purpose to be wives and mothers, to make happy homes,<pb n="96-97"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000048"/> and to be a stay to the strong men who are so
                  energetic if they have "good women-folk," and so helpless without them.</p>
               <p>Perhaps "woman" was not so well understood then as now. All the sublime essays in
                  regard to her station, and that sage analysis of her capacity that was to "show
                  her up" to public view, were yet to come; the men were not born who were to gauge
                  her intellect, and lecture about her. But whether she was appreciated or not, she
                  was very often in circumstances that demanded a peculiar administrative faculty.
                  It is difficult to think of her as the mother and manager of a large family,
                  without seeing that her natural self-poise, tact, and quickness of apprehension
                  just fitted her for her place. Her emotional nature made her the affectionate
                  nurse and care-taker. It is true that our foremothers did not care much for the
                  dry doctrinal arguments that made what was called conversation among the men; they
                  read their Bibles, believed its sweet promises, and trusted the Lord to see to all
                  that was beyond human comprehension; their intuitions of loving evangelical truth
                  serving them better, and leading to more correct conclusions, than any process of
                  slow reasoning.</p>
               <p>Joe Humphreys was so little that we shall forget him entirely if we go on about
                  the women. He was not only a small specimen physically, but he was little in every
                  sense of the word. He had to be tended on a pillow till he was six months old, and
                  when he was a dozen years he was not big enough to be trusted without the
                  guardianship of one of his stout sisters. They all petted him. Being a boy, and
                  coming into the world like an afterthought, when the family was supposed to be
                  complete, he was considered very much in the light of a standing miracle. Every
                  whim was indulged, if possible. It did happen once that he cried when the sun went
                  down, and insisted upon the direct return of that luminary to shine upon his
                  play-ground; but the sun paying no attention to his angry protest, he was obliged
                  for once to suffer the pains of disappointment.</p>
               <p>Only the most amiable nature with the slightest sprinkling of inherent depravity
                  could have successfully resisted such influences, and Joe's nature was purely
                  selfish, to start with. If he had ever had a generous impulse, it had kept itself
                  well in the dark. No one about him seemed to think that he needed any thing of the
                  kind. There was never any reason why Joe should deny himself or be denied any
                  pleasure that he desired. The service and deference of the entire family were laid
                  at his feet. It was not strange that he grew up to manhood with<pb n="98-99"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000049"/> a feeling that the main object of the world's
                  creation was to furnish him a dwelling-place. A few doubts in regard to this had
                  crossed his mind since he had set his heart upon winning Hetty Bowen to share his
                  fortunes, although the idea of ultimate failure in securing so fair a prize did
                  not occur to him. He thought she would be quite ready to accept him for a husband
                  whenever he saw fit to offer himself. The deacon's fine farm joined the Humphreys'
                  acres, and there was no one but Hetty to inherit it. The farm seemed to him quite
                  as valuable as the young damsel. Taking both together, there was a property worth
                  having.</p>
               <p>"The old folks can't live forever," said Joe confidentially to his mother, who was
                  herself older than either the deacon or his wife, and could, therefore, appreciate
                  his view of inconvenient longevity. "As for Mark, he is a master-hand to work. He
                  likes it, and he understands farming like a book. Knows more about land and crops
                  than the deacon a precious sight. So, if he wants to stay on the place and see to
                  it, I sha'n't object."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps he'll get a wife, and set up for himself."</p>
               <p>"Yes. Likely enough. But that needn't hender his working for me. He's a leetle too
                  thick with Hetty just now, but I can soon see to that. About time to look after
                  her a little, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"Yes. You may lose her if you are not careful."</p>
               <p>"No danger. But I guess I'll begin to wait on her a little. Just go home with her
                  from the singing parties and sich places. It will set her to thinking."</p>
               <p>"Mark always goes with her, don't he?"</p>
               <p>"Well, he has, as a general thing, so far."</p>
               <p>"She may take a fancy to him, Joe."</p>
               <p>Joe laughed contemptuously. "Let her if she wants to. Guess't wont take long to
                  cut him out. It's about time, though, to let him know his place. I'll 'tend to it
                  Friday night. They'll be at the 'sing' over to White's."</p>
               <p>The results of Joe's attempt to show Mark his place were not exactly what he had
                  calculated upon. When the "sing" was over, and the girls had put on the warm wraps
                  and close hoods that the wintry weather made necessary, he found Hetty standing
                  alone in the open front door waiting for Mark, who was in the back kitchen on some
                  errand for the deacon. Now was his opportunity.</p>
               <p>"Come, Hetty," said he, stepping briskly to her side, "let us go on a piece
                  together. Mark will catch up with us if we walk slow. Come,"</p>
               <p>"No," said Hetty, "I'll wait for Mark."</p>
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6508-00000050"/>
               <p>"You'd better not. He may not be ready to start this half hour. It takes old White
                  forever to see to any thing."</p>
               <p>"He hasn't got to see to any thing. Mark has only brought home his gimlet and
                  files."</p>
               <p>"Wal, you can't expect to always keep Mark tied to ye. And besides," said Joe,
                  with what he meant for a complimentary leer, "you're too all-fired pretty to hitch
                  on to him. Jest you come with me, Hetty. I should be glad," he added, with
                  generous enthusiasm, "to wait on ye any time, and it is a good time to begin
                  to-night."</p>
               <p>Just here Mark made his appearance with his hat and great-coat on, and a thick red
                  scarf of Hetty's netting wrapped around his neck.</p>
               <p>"All ready, little sister?"</p>
               <p>"Now, you jest look a-here, Mark Woodward," said Joe spunkily, "I am going home
                  with Hetty to-night."</p>
               <p>Mark looked down upon the little fellow with a curious mixture of surprise and
                  anger. He always felt an unacknowledged desire to give him a shaking or a
                  whipping, and the feeling came over him pretty strongly now.</p>
               <p>"Is that true, Hetty?"</p>
               <p>Hetty was any thing but a timid girl, yet she had a constitutional dread of
                  quarreling. She glanced from Mark to Joe, and back again, with a perplexed look
                  that both young men misinterpreted.</p>
               <p>"You see she wants to come with me," said Joe; "why can't ye let her come in
                  peace?"</p>
               <p>"I am not hindering you, Hetty."</p>
               <p>"Come on, then." Joe took hold of her hand, but she pulled it away angrily.</p>
               <p>"Hetty," said Mark kindly, "if you want to walk home with Joe, of course you are
                  free to do so."</p>
               <p>"But I don't," said Hetty, with an energy proportioned to her previous hesitation.
                  "I wish he wouldn't ask me."</p>
               <p>"Now, Hetty," Joe spoke, as he felt, angrily, "I wouldn't be a fool. Mark is eight
                  years older than you. Old enough to be your uncle. You can't expect to always have
                  him at your heels."</p>
               <p>Again that perplexed look came over the girl's face. She could scarcely imagine
                  any circumstances that should separate her from Mark. All her life had been spent
                  with him. She looked up wistfully into his face.</p>
               <p>"Mark, had you rather not be bothered with me?"</p>
               <p>"What a question! No. I like to go with you, and take care of you. But, as Joe
                  hints, you are getting old enough to choose your company."</p>
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6508-00000051"/>
               <p>"Then I shall choose you, of course."</p>
               <p>Hetty's little white mitten stole up shyly to its place on Mark's arm, and was
                  immediately clasped in his left hand! The firm hold reassured her.</p>
               <p>"You'll be sorry for this," said Joe, almost bursting with spite as he saw the
                  look of perfect trust on Hetty's face, "see if you aint. That's all."</p>
               <p>"Why, Joe," Hetty answered, with a merry laugh, "it would be ridiculous for you to
                  go away round by our house this cold night when Mark has got to go any way."</p>
               <p>Joe vouchsafed no reply to this. He stood still and watched them till they were
                  out of sight. Then, as he turned toward home, he said, "This aint the end of it by
                  a long job. Cap'an Mark will find that he can't come in there. I'll buy her a
                  present when I go to Boston. That'll fetch her. Hate to spend money so, but I
                  guess," said Joe, with a satisfied smile, "I guess the old man's farm will pay for
                  it. Nice place the deacon has made of it. Wonder how much he is worth. Something
                  over and above the place, I reckon."</p>
               <p>But Joe had another card to play before adventuring his money. The singing party
                  at White's had come to be a regular weekly meeting of the young people. There were
                  not many of them. although they gathered together from a region several miles in
                  extent, for the country was thinly settled.</p>
               <p>White's was not a public-house, but it was a place where lodging and board for
                  transient visitors or stray travelers could be obtained, and the post-office was
                  in the south room, occupying a corner-cupboard and a table. So it happened that it
                  was a place of popular resort, and therefore a natural nucleus for the musical
                  talent to gather about.</p>
               <p>Joe met Hetty on the road the morning before the next party was to come off. She
                  was on horseback, riding Sylph just to exercise her, but when she saw Joe she
                  stopped and accosted him pleasantly. She remembered his anger, and had a real
                  desire to conciliate him. The Humphreys were good neighbors, and Hetty liked the
                  stout spinsters who had been in and out of her father's house ever since she could
                  remember. If only kind Fate had fashioned Joe after the same pattern! His spirits
                  rose at once when he saw her smiling down upon him. She looked as handsome as a
                  picture, and Sylph was a beauty. Worth quite a sum of money, he thought, and a
                  horse that any body would like to own. He patted her neck, and looked into her
                  mouth inquiringly, a liberty that Sylph resented at once.</p>
               <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6508-00000052"/>
               <p>"Keep away from her head, Joe. She'll bite you. She wont let any body play with
                  her excepting Mark and me."</p>
               <p>Joe fell back a step. "Stop a minute, Hetty, I want to ask you something."</p>
               <p>Hetty had an uneasy suspicion of what the something might be, and Sylph seemed to
                  share in her suspicion. The fiery little mare was not at all inclined to stand
                  still and hear him talk.</p>
               <p>"Wait till another time, Joe." Hetty brought up by the fence, where Sylph could
                  not see her imaginary foe, but she was too restive to be kept there.</p>
               <p>"It is only a word, Hetty. I want to go home with you to-night. May I?"</p>
               <p>"No; Mark will be there."</p>
               <p>"Now, Hetty, you're as blind as a bat. Every body knows that Mark is a-hankering
                  after Margaret Brown. It's pretty high for him to look, but 'love goes where 'tis
                  sent.' He'd like amazing well to know that you was all safe and sound with me, so
                  that he could go home with her. You see your folks have done so much for him that
                  he feels kinder obligated to look after you. Margaret is a smart girl," said Joe
                  in a patronizing way, "and will make Mark a good wife. You don't want to stand in
                  his way, do you?"</p>
               <p>Hetty's dark eyes opened wide. The idea that Mark would ever marry was a new one.
                  She had never been given to speculating on the future. Her life had been a happy
                  one, and she had been contented to take things only as fast as they came
                  along.</p>
               <p>Margaret Brown was a good-looking, fair girl, several years older than Hetty. One
                  of those steady, proper persons who never seem to have any faults, but whose
                  perfections do not make them lovable. Hetty remembered that Mark used to speak of
                  her as a pattern for wild girls like herself, and how he had once said that
                  Margaret Brown would never think of climbing trees or of swimming in the big
                  pond.</p>
               <p>Joe's story seemed very probable. Sylph evidently did not believe a word of it,
                  for she kicked out the strongest dissent in the direction of his voice.</p>
               <p>"I can't keep her another minute, Joe. She wont stand here."</p>
               <p>"Well, you just promise to let me go home with you to-night."</p>
               <p>"No, I sha'n't promise, because I mightn't keep the promise, you see. Now,
                  Sylph!"</p>
               <p>They were off like the wind before Joe could say another word. "I'll resk her
                  now," he said with a chuckling laugh. "She's too high-strung to tell Mark about
                  Margaret, but she'll make<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6508-00000053"/> him keep away
                  from her. I've done it now, sure. I sha'n't have to buy any present. Wal, it's
                  worth every thing in this world to know how to manage."</p>
               <p>As Hetty rode rapidly homeward she could not understand the sudden depression of
                  spirits that came over her. Neither could she comprehend how she had been so blind
                  to Mark's affection for Margaret, or, indeed, why she was so reluctant to believe
                  in it now. If Joe and every body else had seen it so plainly, how could it have
                  escaped her observation?</p>
               <p>"Mark is always praising her. I might have known."</p>
               <p>Hetty showed but little knowledge of human nature in this, but she had no
                  experience to guide her. All day long she turned the matter over and over in her
                  mind, and the probabilities grew so strong, that it is a wonder that she did not
                  have Mark married and settled down in a nest of his own before night.</p>
               <p>Her mother remarked her unusual silence with some anxiety. The house seemed
                  strange and not home-like, missing the merry laughter and snatches of tunes that
                  usually enlivened it. The work of the day was done as deftly and quickly as ever;
                  nothing was neglected that fell to Hetty's share, but the bright, cheery spirit
                  that made toil seem a pleasure was lacking ing. The mother said nothing, but she
                  puzzled herself with conjectures. It was a new thing to see those clear, sweet
                  eyes with their expression of trouble.</p>
               <p>It was rather late when Mark came down stairs, ready to start for "White's." He
                  did not notice at first that Hetty had not changed her dress to go out.</p>
               <p>"Have I kept you waiting, Hetty?" he asked as he came in.</p>
               <p>"No; I am not going."</p>
               <p>"Not going! how does that happen? I thought nothing could keep you from a 'sing.'
                  Are you not well?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. I don't want to go; that is all. I hope you will have a good time."</p>
               <p>Hetty's face was turned from him, but there was a suspicious tremor in her voice.
                  She knew that she could not answer another question without crying childishly.
                  Mark knew it, too, and he said nothing, while she laid down her work and walked
                  slowly out of the room.</p>
               <p>"Never mind her, Mark," said Mrs. Bowen, kindly. "She hasn't seemed a bit like
                  herself all day."</p>
               <p>"She was bright enough this morning."</p>
               <p>"Before she went off on Sylph. Yes, I know she was. But she came home just as she
                  is now. Something happened to vex her while<pb n="108-109"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000054"/> she was out. She will tell me when she gets ready.
                  I am glad she is not going to-night. The clouds look squally."</p>
               <p>"Yes; a snow-storm is brewing."</p>
               <p>"They'll miss her voice," said the mother, with a touch of natural pride in
                  Hetty's musical gifts.</p>
               <p>After Mark had gone Hetty came in again, and took up her work as usual. Her father
                  coming in at the same time, expressed his approval of her wisdom in staying at
                  home.</p>
               <p>"It begins to snow now," he said. "Mark would have been wiser if he had followed
                  your example, little one. Suppose you and I get up some music at home."</p>
               <p>Hetty agreed at once. She was always ready to sing, and knew nothing of the common
                  affectation of waiting to be urged before commencing. Her father's fine bass voice
                  blended admirably with hers, and the numberless quirks and changes of the old
                  tunes rippled up and down the long kitchen like a sea of melody.</p>
               <p>"I guess they haven't had any singing at White's to beat ours," said the deacon
                  when the evening was spent and the early bed-time came. "They may have got up more
                  noise, but we have made the music. Eh, Hetty?"</p>
               <p>The father's eye was not so keen as the mother's. He did not detect the unquiet
                  mind under Hetty's outside merriment. But Mistress Bowen was a wise woman. She
                  left the girl to herself, knowing well that any deep trouble would soon crave the
                  sympathy of "mother dear," as Hetty lovingly called her.</p>
               <p>"It seems a pity to rake up the fire before Mark comes in. He will be cold," said
                  the deacon, who had been to the door to ascertain the state of the weather. "It
                  has not snowed much yet."</p>
               <p>"Let me sit up for him, mother," said Hetty. "I am not a bit sleepy."</p>
               <p>"Well, I am. I can hardly keep my eyes open."</p>
               <p>"He will be in soon. They do not sing after nine o'clock."</p>
               <p>"Well, child, sit up if you like. Get Mark a lunch if he wants one; and don't
                  forget to fasten the back door."</p>
               <p>Left to herself, Hetty sat down before the bright fire, and, clasping her hands
                  over her knees, gave free reins to her thoughts. The party was over by this time,
                  and Mark was, no doubt, walking home with Margaret. It was a mile to her father's
                  house, and, of course, they would not hurry. The light snow hardly covered the
                  ground, and there was no wind. The moon even looked out a moment through a rift in
                  the clouds. It was not an unpleasant night<pb n="110-111"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000055"/> for a walk, especially if one could choose their
                  company.</p>
               <p>It would be ten o'clock before he could get round, but she would keep the fire
                  bright. Poor Hetty! When ten and then eleven o'clock came without bringing him,
                  her abnegation of self was rather severely tested.</p>
               <p>"He is indeed making the most of his first opportunity," she said, and a couple of
                  big tears went sparkling down over the red cheeks before she could shut them back.
                  Then she heard his step at the door, and summoned back her smiles to greet him so
                  suddenly that the rival emotions puckered all natural expression out of her face.
                  It was lucky for her that he had to stop on the stoop to shake off the light
                  snow.</p>
               <p>He opened the door softly so as not to awaken the sleeping family, and started
                  with real surprise at finding Hetty awaiting him. It is doubtful if she was ever
                  up so late before in all her life.</p>
               <p>"Why, Hetty! You up at this hour?"</p>
               <p>"Yes." She turned her face away to hide the lips that would quiver. "I sat up to
                  keep the fire."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry. You ought to have been in bed long ago. I should have come earlier if
                  I had thought of this."</p>
               <p>He might at least be thankful, Hetty thought; but she magnanimously brought out
                  his lunch, in spite of his ingratitude. And, being now spunky enough to speak
                  naturally, she asked, "Were there many out to-night, Mark?"</p>
               <p>"To the party? I do not know. I haven't been there."</p>
               <p>"Not been there!" Hetty repeated the words as if she did not understand them. The
                  gloomy air-castles that she had built with so much pains began to tumble in
                  pieces.</p>
               <p>"You see, Hetty," said Mark, composedly cutting a huge slice of brown bread and
                  cheese, "I didn't care to go without you. So I went over to see Uncle Sam Porter.
                  He is almost gone, and his wife is worn out with watching. I sent her to bed, and
                  I sat by him while she got a good nap. I should have stayed all night, only I
                  feared Aunt Bowen would worry. I shall watch to-morrow night, if he lives till
                  then."</p>
               <p>Instead of answering him, Hetty burst into tears. Mark had seen that something was
                  the matter, but had no idea of any serious trouble until this sudden outbreak of
                  feeling. Tears come very easy to some persons, but he knew that Hetty was not of
                  the crying sort.</p>
               <p>"Why, Hetty dear, are you so nervous? I wouldn't have mentioned Uncle Sam if I had
                  known you would have cared so much. He does not suffer now."</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6508-00000056"/>
               <p>"It isn't that," sobbed Hetty. "I don't care any thing about Uncle Sam. That is, I
                  am sorry he is sick, of course," added she, with admirable consistency.</p>
               <p>"Something has been the matter with our Hetty all day. So mother says. If she will
                  tell me all about it," said Mark kindly, "I am sure she will feel better."</p>
               <p>"It is about you, Mark." Hetty did not think of withholding the confidence that he
                  asked. Had not she always told him every thing?</p>
               <p>"About me! All this worrying about me! What have I done?"</p>
               <p>"Joe told me this morning that I hindered you from going with Margaret Brown."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" Mark began to be enlightened.</p>
               <p>"Yes. He said I ought to let him wait on me, so that you could be free. And I
                  don't want him hanging round me."</p>
               <p>"Well, Hetty, you can tell him that he is mistaken for once. I shall not try to go
                  with Margaret, and I shall take care of you till you find some one that you like
                  better. You will tell me when that happens?"</p>
               <p>Hetty's face grew so bright and rosy that Mark was sorely tempted to give her a
                  kiss. Only the consciousness that it would not be a purely brotherly salute
                  restrained him. Promiscuous miscuous kissing was not allowable in those days. So
                  Hetty did not kiss him good-night after our fashion, but she took her candle and
                  went singing up the stairs, all her troubles gone.</p>
               <p>As for Joe, it seemed probable that he would have to buy a present after all.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE AGED PILGRIM.</head>
               <p>EARLY in January the old grandfather began to fail visibly. He still sat in the
                  high-backed chair by the west window, on sunny afternoons, and filled his corner
                  by the evening fireside until his usual bed-time; yet there was a perceptible
                  change in him. His step was more feeble, and his eyes, which had been remarkably
                  strong, grew dim, and his sight uncertain.</p>
               <p>There was none of the querulousness and impatience that often accompanies second
                  childhood. Indeed, he seemed to live wholly in the past and the future; the
                  present had no interest for him except a momentary one. The exciting subjects that
                  stirred up the whole country fell on his ear like idle tales. The arbitrary
                  English Government and its Tory adherents were nothing to him, though the
                  conversation in regard to them often struck a chord of memory, and recalled his
                  youth.</p>
               <p>No one desired to hasten his departure. People in those days rose up respectfully
                  before the hoary head, and tenderly helped the aged feet down the slope of life.
                  And, therefore, old age was not the dreaded period that it has come to be now.</p>
               <p>He had all those slow, quiet ways that come with age, and a gentle way of speaking
                  that was like a benediction. A Sabbath peace shone in his face, and gave a most
                  beautiful serenity to his whole appearance.</p>
               <p>They humored all his fancies. Mark hurried through the evening chores to get time
                  to read the Bible to him, because the old man imagined him to be the honored
                  pastor under whose ministry at Plymouth he had sat nearly a century ago.</p>
               <p>The neighbors abounded in kindly attentions. "Neighbor" was but another name for
                  family friend. Individual interests were not lost in a crowd, but each person was
                  known for himself. All matters of weal or woe were general property, and a
                  knowledge of a neighbor's affairs was not thought meddlesome. When no impertinence
                  was intended, no one took pains to imagine an affront. In times of trouble there
                  was no end to the cordial sympathy and acts of kindness that help so much. The
                  Puritan religion was not a mere passive principle. Its disciples literally bore
                  one another's burdens, and so fulfilled the law of Christ.</p>
               <p>The old man's failing health was a matter of<pb n="116-117"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000058"/> interest all over the town. Not a day passed
                  without messages of neighborly inquiry and offers of help. The Humphreys sent Joe
                  over every evening to ask after him. He was nothing loath to undertake the errand
                  which gave a chance to see Hetty; but she soon learned to regard these frequent
                  calls as the plague of her life. They were not agreeable to any one. Mark always
                  left the room, because, in his presence, Joe always aired his Toryism, and it was
                  such a trial to refrain from knocking him down.</p>
               <p>Joe's conversation on any theme was apt to provoke his hearers. He had no delicacy
                  of feeling, and no respect for the feelings of others. His talk was always
                  garnished with a profusion of those expletives which are supposed by foreigners to
                  make up the Yankee vernacular. We do not choose to recall them, though Joe's lazy,
                  drawling way is not half represented without them. But slang is always slang, and,
                  whether ancient or modern, is too inelegant to be written, and should be accounted
                  too vulgar to be spoken.</p>
               <p>"Seems to me," he said one Sunday evening when he called to make his usual
                  inquiries—"seems to me the old chap lives an everlasting while. Tough, a'n't
                  he?"</p>
               <p>Hetty was too indignant to reply. She did not take pains to answer him half of the
                  time.</p>
               <p>"Runs in the blood to be long-lived, don't it?" he went on, thinking that if the
                  deacon was going to live to the unreasonable age of ninety-eight also, he should
                  be an old man himself before the farm would come into his hands.</p>
               <p>"You're a terrible healthy race, a'n't ye?"</p>
               <p>Still receiving no answer, he sat down in the window-seat to consider the state of
                  affairs.</p>
               <p>The wide kitchen presented a cheery, homelike aspect that contrasted pleasantly
                  with the chill waste of snow outside. The huge fire on the hearth roared like a
                  good-natured giant up the wide chimney, sending its warmth into the farthest
                  corners of the room, and touching with a rosy glow all the old-fashioned
                  furniture. On the high settle Hetty sat knitting by the firelight. Joe longed to
                  occupy a portion of the long seat by her side, but even his presumption did not
                  quite dare to attempt it. For once, when he had only drawn a chair close to hers,
                  she had pulled it away just as he was sitting down, and left him on his back, with
                  his heels waving like banners in the air. Joe had never forgotten the flash of
                  those great, dark eyes as she left him to pick himself up at his leisure. So,
                  to-night, he only eyed her wistfully, at the<pb n="118-119"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000059"/> same time exulting in the good time coming, when he
                  could sit as near to Hetty as he pleased.</p>
               <p>Presently the deacon came in with his arms full of wood to replenish the fire.
                  Close behind him appeared the comely face of Mistress Bowen, smiling genially upon
                  the world in general, and looking so motherly and comfortable that it was like a
                  glimpse of a clear, sunny day just to look at her.</p>
               <p>But it was the deacon who particularly attracted Joe's notice. His well-knit,
                  athletic figure and healthy complexion showed to advantage in the ruddy light of
                  the fire. There was scarcely a thread of silver in the abundant hair that his wife
                  had braided into a shining tail for Sunday wear.</p>
               <p>"Looks as if there was a sight of wear in him yet," thought Joe, discontentedly.
                  But an encouraging idea came to the rescue: "I've seen pale, pindling folks that
                  would hang on for ever and ever, and well folks a-dropping off all the time.
                  Appearances is desateful. Now, fevers and sich-like take a powerful hold of these
                  awful hearty critters. Shouldn't wonder now ef the deacon should go off some day
                  like the pop of a gun."</p>
               <p>Brightened by this view of possibilities, Joe tried to start a little neighborly
                  talk.</p>
               <p>"S'pose you don't need any help about watching and sich?"</p>
               <p>"No," said the deacon; "we get along nicely. Mark sleeps in grandfather's room,
                  and mother and I are in and out pretty often. Thank you all the same."</p>
               <p>"Wal, glad to hear you are so well off. Thought if you needed help 'twould be a
                  good plan to send over some of our women folks. Plenty of 'em, you know," said
                  Joe, chuckling.</p>
               <p>"None too many, Joe. They are kind neighbors."</p>
               <p>"Wal, yes. But I s'pose we could get along with half a dozen less over to our
                  house."</p>
               <p>"You'd have to go to work yourself, in that case," said Mistress Bowen, who did
                  not relish Joe's way of speaking of women. "Kezzy and Deborah are going to be
                  married, and the rest are too smart not to get good husbands some time. I wonder
                  what you will do for yourself then."</p>
               <p>"Get married too," said Joe, sheepishly glancing at Hetty to see how she took this
                  announcement of his intentions. She did not seem to hear what he was saying; she
                  was diligently counting the stitches that were to be parted off for the heel of
                  her stocking. The early bedtime of those days was near at hand, and he was obliged
                  to go.</p>
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6508-00000060"/>
               <p>"Wal, about the old man; what shall I tell our folks?"</p>
               <p>"Tell them that there isn't much change. He is about the same that he was a week
                  ago. Doesn't suffer at all, thank God!" said the deacon reverently.</p>
               <p>"Queer now, aint it? Shouldn't wonder a mite if he roused up and held on a dozen
                  years yet. You never can tell what sech old covies will be up to. There's old Sam
                  Wilder, he's hard on to eighty, and he's had spells o'dying, off and on, for ten
                  years. And now he's gone crazy, and has to be watched every minute, else he's
                  kiting round the neighborhood like all possessed. Seems as if he tried to
                  aggravate folks. Wal, good-night. Let us know if you want us."</p>
               <p>Hetty sat in speechless wrath until the outside door closed after him. Then she
                  laid down her work and said, "If it was not wicked, mother, I should wish that Joe
                  Humphreys had been born deaf and dumb. He's a regular nuisance."</p>
               <p>"Sho! sho! child. Let him alone. He isn't worth getting angry with. Run into
                  grandpa's room and see if Mark is tired of staying there."</p>
               <p>"He has his book, mother dear. He is never tired if he can read."</p>
               <p>"Never mind—just ask him. It will get her my mind off of that Joe," said the
                  mother, as Hetty went into the next room. "I do wonder, deacon, what that
                  simpleton was made for."</p>
               <p>Hetty found Mark deep in "Burton's Historical Collection," but he laid the book
                  down when she appeared.</p>
               <p>"I was just coming for you, Hetty. Grandpa wants to hear us all sing. Has Joe
                  gone?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I hope so. What a provoking fool he is! I hope he'll slip down on the ice a
                  hundred times before he gets home, and sprain him in a new place every time."</p>
               <p>"Why, Hetty! what a spirit!" Mark began, reprovingly; but the thought of Joe's
                  little body with a hundred sprains on it was so comical that he laughed instead.
                  "Never mind him, pussy. You call your father and mother while I fix this fire, and
                  then we'll sing Joe out of mind."</p>
               <p>Very few people of this generation have ever listened to those soulful minor-tunes
                  that the old man loved; and whatever we may have gained in artistic skill, we
                  retain little of the moving, inspiring power of those quaint melodies. There was a
                  solemn, unearthly undertone breathing in every strain that was in keeping with the
                  stern theology of the words. These last were sung somewhat doubtingly by Mark, who
                  inclined to the Arminian tenets that even<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6508-00000061"
                  /> then troubled many of the godly in New England; but the deacon and his wife
                  uttered them reverently as eternal verities. No flippant voluntaries preceded
                  them; no vague interludes separated them and split their meaning into fragments.
                  The pathetic chords were all rendered by the human voice, and they blended and
                  swelled in volume until the music seemed to the old sire's failing ear like a
                  chorus of angels.</p>
               <p>"Your voice is as sweet as ever, Huldah," he said, dreamily, turning on his pillow
                  to look into Hetty's face.</p>
               <p>Huldah was the wife of his youth, wooed and won more than seventy years ago. He
                  often called Hetty by her name. In spite of his helpless and wandering mind, there
                  was an especial loveliness in his ripe old age. He would sit for hours in silence,
                  looking out upon the wintry landscape, his face brightening and softening
                  alternately in its expression as his thoughts caught a vision of the "long ago,"
                  or of the light just breaking for him on the eternal hills. All loved him, and yet
                  no one sorrowed when he died, the translation seemed so little like death. He had
                  been peacefully happy all day, and just as the sun was setting, and the calm of
                  closing day settling over the busy world, the heavenly messenger came for him. The
                  old man, his eyes beaming bright with celestial recognition, stretched out his
                  arms to the unseen guide, and joyfully passed over the river. It was not death to
                  him, but rather the entering upon life.</p>
               <p>There was no room for natural grief, but plenty for loving memories. In the
                  evening, they gathered with the neighbors around the fireside, and spoke softly of
                  his long and useful life, his noble manhood, and the sweet content of his
                  declining years, all glorified, as they were, with that steadfast faith that
                  raises fallen man to sacred communion with the infinite God.</p>
               <p>"He was one of the chosen of the Lord," said Aunt Hannah Laud, piously.</p>
               <p>Aunt Hannah was considered a saint herself, and therefore a judge of all spiritual
                  matters. No one thought of dissenting from her opinion—not even Hetty, who was
                  querying in her own unsanctified mind why it was any personal credit to grandpa to
                  be one of the chosen ones, as he had no part in procuring the divine choice, and
                  also how she or any other poor sinner could be to blame for being among the
                  unchosen. Ah! how many wearisome, unhappy hours have been hopelessly wasted over
                  that one question!</p>
               <p>They laid the old man among his kindred on the bleak hill-side, which was then, as
                  now, called "Burying Hill." In those days no one thought of beautifying
                  cemeteries. The most<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6508-00000062"/> barren spots were
                  used for burial-places. It would have been thought sinful to do aught to lessen
                  the wholesome dread of death by making its accompaniments less gloomy. People
                  remembered funerals in those days. They were too awfully solemn to be easily
                  forgotten. Even the funeral treat of rum and sugar did not raise the spirits above
                  a proper decorum. It only gave clearness to the wailing notes of old "China,"
                  which was a favorite tune with all mourners.</p>
               <p>"Burying Hill," in Weymouth, had from the first one advantage. As Aunt Hannah
                  expressed it, "It was an amazing sightly place;" an important consideration to its
                  occupants. It has been made a charming cemetery in modern times. Choice flowering
                  shrubs and annuals blossom among its grassy mounds, and trees shade its winding
                  paths. To be sure, the old bones of the colonists have been tossed about and
                  packed here and there to facilitate the improvements, and those who expected to
                  sleep undisturbed till the resurrection have found themselves grievously mistaken;
                  but it is a beautiful place, and we have a fair or some kind of a frolic every
                  year to keep it beautiful; and the dead have a great deal to be thankful for if
                  they only knew it.</p>

               <p>IT is not to be supposed that Hetty and the fair young damsels of her time were
                  indifferent to dress, or insensible to the value of personal beauty. But the
                  provincial maidens were too fully imbued with the patriotic spirit of their
                  fathers and brothers to buy imported goods. However much innocent vanity they
                  might possess, the obnoxious English Government did not make a cent out of it.</p>
               <p>Many a lovely maiden was wooed and married in plain homespun, and looked as
                  charming in the eyes of her husband as if she had been decked in the costliest
                  satins and laces. Beginning thus their wedded life with good common sense on both
                  sides, a foundation for permanent prosperity was laid, and divorces were
                  abominations unheard of.</p>
               <p>Hetty had never worn a silk dress. Her best dress for summer wear was a fine linen
                  cambric made out of one that had been her mother's before her marriage. Her winter
                  go-to-meeting suit was a thick blue woolen gown and a crimson cloak. These were of
                  home manufacture,<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6508-00000063"/> even to the brilliant
                  coloring. We can imagine how they set off Hetty's bright complexion and dark eyes.
                  Her hair, which was suffered to hang in a mass of ringlets all the week, was on
                  Sunday rolled over a cushion at the top of her head and confined in decorous
                  braids at the back, very much after the pattern now in vogue.</p>
               <p>Tradition, which tells the truth quite as often as history, has so often repeated
                  the fact that she was the handsomest girl ever seen in the old north
                  meeting-house, that it must be true by this time, whatever it might have been when
                  the report was started.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it was the wholesome country diet that painted her cheeks and gave
                  brilliancy to her eyes. Then she was perfectly healthy. The word dyspepsia, so
                  common now, would have been Greek to her; and as to nerves, it is doubtful if she
                  ever suspected that she had any. Life must have been very delightful before nerves
                  and indigestion came in. We fight the latter by attempted returns to the
                  old-fashioned diet, but it is too late. We should have been brought up on it. My
                  grandfather used to tell us that it was the crusts of rye and Indian bread that
                  made rosy cheeks and white teeth. Many a tough crust have we patiently munched in
                  full faith of the beauty waiting to be thus revealed to us.</p>
               <p>The exorbitant prices of all kinds of goods kept our great-great-grandmothers to
                  dress-goods of their own devising. Linen was twenty dollars a yard after the war
                  commenced. The most common calicoes were from thirty to forty dollars, and
                  broadcloths were forty pounds. The depreciation of the paper currency created
                  unheard-of prices.</p>
               <p>Pins, now so indispensable an adjunct of the toilet, were so high and scarce that
                  only the richest ladies could use them, and they found it extremely difficult to
                  procure them by paying three pounds for a package containing six thousand.</p>
               <p>Ladies made their own shoes of "black calamanco"—whatever that was—and itinerant
                  shoemakers put on the soles and the high-pointed heels. The rustic belles were
                  content with stout leather brogans, made high, and laced with leather strings.</p>
               <p>Middle-aged women did not vie with young girls in wearing the appropriate
                  ornaments of youth. Mistress Bowen would have been ashamed to show her motherly
                  face in meeting if its wrinkles were brought out to public notice by the close
                  neighborhood of artificial roses. She wore a cosy-looking brown-silk bonnet, which
                  had been freshly made over once in two years ever since Hetty's remembrance.
                     Very<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6508-00000064"/> nice it looked after its
                  furbishing and refurbishing.</p>
               <p>There were very few silk dresses in Wey-mouth when the war broke out. The
                  ministers wife wore the well-preserved brocades that showed her aristocratic
                  position, and her daughter's, who, though married, often came to grace the
                  home-pew in their father's church, displayed carefully-kept laces that age had
                  made valuable. Of the dress of the young gallants we have this account: "Gentlemen
                  wore scarlet coats and swords, with laced ruffles over their hands, hair turned
                  back from the forehead, and curled and frizzed, clubbed and cued behind, highly
                  powdered and pomatumed, with small-clothes, silk stockings, and shoes ornamented
                  with brilliant buckles."</p>
               <p>One would suppose that the ladies had but little chance for display by the side of
                  such showy men. If so, they only followed the teachings of nature, which decks the
                  peacock and other male birds in gaudy plumage, while the mother-bird wears the
                  sober colors suited to thought and seclusion. How they ever performed the
                  thirty-six changes of the formal minuet in their high-heeled shoes would be a
                  mystery did we not know that the word impossible was never known in a lady's
                  vocabulary where fashion was concerned. That women now wear gay colors and men the
                  reverse shows the progress of the fair sex in securing their rights.</p>
               <p>Patrick Henry's usual dress in the Virginia Legislature was a black velvet coat
                  with broad white frills at the breast and wrists, a white cravat, and a scarlet
                  mantle over his shoulders. This, added to the long silk stockings and brilliant
                  buckles of the period, made him as conspicuous for looks as for oratory.</p>
               <p>In the sparsely-settled town of Weymouth we can scarcely hope to find much of what
                  was called society. But that New England was not deficient in this respect is
                  proved by the records of Newport, which, all through the war, was its social
                  capital.</p>
               <p>The fame of its charming women is still fresh. The Prince de Broglie, who visited
                  the place directly after the Revolution, is enthusiastic in his praises. The
                  graceful simplicity of the fair Quakeresses is especially noted by him. He speaks
                  of Polly Lawton, whose dress, "white as milk," with a little plaited cap, must
                  have presented a strong contrast to the splendid attire of the court-ladies of
                  France. He declares: "Whenever I see her, I am tempted to write a great book
                  against the finery, the factitious graces, and the coquetry of many ladies whom
                  the world admires."</p>

               <p>De Segur is enchanted with their intelligence, grace, and beauty. The incomparable
                  Polly Lawton seems to have bewitched him, while the purity of her mind and the
                  dignified simplicity of her manners awed him.</p>
               <p>The French officers who visited the "Isle of Peace" during the war never forgot
                  the names of its lovely maidens. Miss Champlin and the Misses Hunter were among
                  the most famous; and the beautiful daughters of William Ellery still live in the
                  home traditions.</p>
               <p>When Washington visited the place, in 1781, the citizens gave a ball in his honor.
                  The chivalrous general opened the ball with Miss Champlin, and requested her to
                  name the dance. She chose "A Successful Campaign," and the admiring French
                  officers courteously took the instruments from the hands of the musicians and
                  played the music themselves.</p>
               <p>The name of Betsey Haliburton is still seen written with a diamond upon a window
                  in the room where the general had his tea.</p>
               <p>These beautiful women were not helpless fine ladies. Whether there were any of
                  this latter breed in America, then neither tradition nor history informs us. We
                  are told that: "In three months' time a Newport lady and her daughter spun and
                  wove full sixty yards of good, fine linen cloth, nearly a yard wide, besides
                  taking care of a large family."</p>
               <p>Not a whit less fair than the fairest of these was our Hetty—as actively useful as
                  any of them, though unknown to written fame until this present record. The young
                  ladies who shriek if a spider chances to swing down from the ceiling, or a
                  grasshopper, in a spirit of inquiry, pops himself under the muslin folds of their
                  drapery, will, perhaps, be unable to appreciate her when I tell them that,
                  happening to glance out of the open door one summer day, she saw a big black
                  snake, fully six feet long, leisurely crossing the foot-path, and, springing out
                  of the house, without so much as a cry, killed him with one dexterous thump of the
                  rolling-pin which happened to be in her hand. She would have despised the silly
                  affectation of fear that runs from a mouse. The forest was full of charms for her,
                  and every shady nook for miles around was as familiar as the home-farm. In vain
                  the reticent hens hid their nests among the bushes and waited till they were out
                  of the wood before they cackled the triumphs of egg-laying; Hetty's eye was quite
                  as good as theirs in marking cosy corners and private hollows, and she was sure to
                     rummage<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6508-00000066"/> about and spoil the
                  prospective batch of chickens.</p>
               <p>A favorite recreation of the women-folks was the gathering of roots and herbs for
                  medicinal purposes. The doctor's business was not a particularly paying one, for
                  he was sent for only in extreme cases. The home practice answered admirably for
                  all common emergencies.</p>
               <p>All young girls studied medicine, just as they learned to combine half a dozen
                  kinds of roots and herbs, and brew them into the cool, spicy beer so refreshing to
                  the farmer in the summertime. Hetty's beer was worth drinking. According to her
                  father, "it was as good as the mother's," and no higher praise could be given to
                  it.</p>
               <p>Every fall the high garret was made fragrant with the additions to its herbarium.
                  Sage, thyme, tansy, elecampane, boneset, yarrow, marsh-rosemary, golden-root,
                  mullein, pennyroyal, hyssop, and numberless other kinds, hung in great bunches
                  from the rafters and curtained the little square windows.</p>
               <p>A favorite resort of the young people was the Indian house-rock. It should be
                  among our curious relics now, but there are few of the present generation aware of
                  its existence. Indeed, it is somewhat difficult to find it, for the same trees and
                  bushes that secluded it a century tury ago hide it now, and one can go very near
                  it without seeing it.</p>
               <p>I remember perfectly what a wonderful place it looked to my childish eyes, and how
                  my imagination repeopled it with the dusky warriors who had once made it their
                  home. It consists of one rather spacious room inside of a huge rock. The only
                  entrance is through a long, narrow fissure in the rock, perhaps twelve feet in
                  length, which is overhung and hedged in by a nearly impervious tangle of trees,
                  bushes, and ivy. It is a place exceedingly suggestive of snakes and toads, and
                  other interesting reptiles, and one shrinks instinctively from a touch of the damp
                  walls. Climbing from the inside to the top, we find the still blackened platform
                  where the Indians built their fires and cooked their hominy and succotash.</p>
               <p>Close by, but quite hidden from sight by the trees, is one of those lovely inland
                  lakelets so common in New England. It is three miles long, and about a mile in
                  width. It is a resort of myriads of wild fowl, and a favorite ground for
                  sportsmen. Hetty and Mark often rowed their boat across its clear waters, or, with
                  a single sail, sped rapidly over its bosom when the winds were favorable. Neither
                  of them minded the three miles' walk home. The hum of the ever-growing village is
                  near enough to<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6508-00000067"/> penetrate the woods that
                  encircle the house-rock, but it still keeps its ancient solitude. Summer
                  boating-parties often pass it on their way up the lake, and songs by fresh young
                  voices float out on the evening air; but our thoughts go back to the past, and it
                  is Hetty's clear, sweet tones that we hear echoing across the waters.</p>

               <head type="sub">AN UNAPPRECIATED GIFT.</head>
               <p>THE Weymouth spring-time is very beautiful after it once gets along. The graceful
                  irregularity of its landscapes; its misty hilltops and sunny knolls; its woodlands
                  bright with every shade of green; the silvery vapor that curtains the distant sea
                  or makes rainbows in the valleys, make up a romantic picture as charming as many
                  more famous localities.</p>
               <p>In tropical countries, where buds, leaves, flowers, and fruit are seen on the same
                  tree, and good Mother Nature works steadily all the year round, the miracle of
                  renewed life is never beheld as it is here where the old lady is indulged with
                  long resting-spells. Not a stroke of work does she do while the cold lasts, but
                  just hibernates with the bears and hornets. The snows fall of themselves, and the
                  ice freezes of its own accord; there is no principle of life in either—that is, no
                  apparent principle.</p>
               <p>But with the spring-time, the great mother begins to rub open her eyes and stretch
                  herself. Up from the hard soil spring the grasses; swelling buds cover the forests
                  with a rosy haze of<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6508-00000068"/> beauty; the pines
                  begin to manufacture their long green needles; the sky grows bluer; the violets
                  and anemones peep out from the mossy hollows by the brooks, and in a little time
                  the spring is established.</p>
               <p>But there was very little thought about all this natural loveliness in the spring
                  of 1775. Sterner subjects had taken possession of the public mind. For ten long
                  years the colonies had been restive under the oppressive demands of the British
                  Government, which had grown more burdensome and tyrannical all the time. The
                  spirit of opposition to these encroachments had strengthened with each new burden,
                  and a determination to resist all further interference with the public rights had
                  become general.</p>
               <p>Looking back over the last century, it seems incredible that the British
                  Parliament could have so misapprehended the character of the colonists. That they
                  were thinking men who understood their position, and would not tamely brook the
                  violation of their rights, was evident, and yet the adherents of the ministry
                  looked upon them as legitimate subjects of abuse and ridicule. "The Americans,"
                  they said, "were naturally cowards, habitually lazy, and constitutionally feeble;
                  they were incapable of discipline, and a small force would be sufficient to
                  conquer them." This ignorance was general throughout England.</p>
               <p>Instead of conciliating the excited colonists by conceding those advantages of
                  commerce which were their natural right, they imposed new restrictions upon trade,
                  and fishing along the banks of Newfoundland was prohibited. The whole country was
                  aroused. The clergy called their people together in all the churches, and
                  appointed days for solemn fasting and prayer. They painted in vivid colors the
                  sufferings of the inhabitants of Boston, and in eloquent language pointed out the
                  dangers threatening religious as well as civil liberty.</p>
               <p>The old-time fast-days were strictly kept. There were no shooting-matches or
                  base-ball playing; no balls at night. Fasting, humiliation, and prayer meant
                  something besides a national frolic. Long prayers and longer sermons whetted the
                  appetite until it was sharp enough to envy the prodigal son the husks that the
                  swine did eat, yet no one dared to eat a morsel of dinner.</p>
               <p>Children of unquestionable depravity would sometimes surreptitiously abstract raw
                  turnips from the cellar, and munch them in private places with a relish that
                  almost compensated for the horrible conviction that they were breaking all the ten
                  commandments. But the elders<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6508-00000069"/> fasted, as
                  they did every thing else, thoroughly, and gave their minds to it.</p>
               <p>Parson Smith bore a testimony full of patriotism and courage. It never occurred to
                  him that being a minister of the Gospel destroyed his citizenship. Nobody hinted
                  that preachers had better keep clear of politics. He considered himself a leader
                  of the people, and—he led.</p>
               <p>There was a good deal of stirring preaching that grew out of the belief that man's
                  duty to God comprehended man's duty to man.</p>
               <p>This question of duty was a sore puzzle to our Hetty. She could not reconcile the
                  rousing calls to activity with the "machine doctrines" in which she had been
                  educated.</p>
               <p>"Mark," she said, after one of the parson's most vehement appeals had been
                  rehashed and discussed in the home-circle, "the parson prayed for his country
                  to-day as if he really thought it would amount to something."</p>
               <p>"Of course he thought so," said her father, before Mark could speak. "And it's my
                  opinion that the British will find it hard work to stand their ground against such
                  prayers as are going up to the Almighty now. I never heard any thing equal to
                  Parson Smith's talk when he came to speak of the fighting last week at Lexington
                  and Concord."</p>
               <p>"I wish I had known that there was any fighting going on," said Mark, gloomily. "I
                  ought to have been there."</p>
               <p>"You'll have plenty of chances, my boy. Don't you fret. This is only the
                  beginning. It will be a hard struggle, but we shall win. God is not deaf to the
                  prayers of his people," he added, reverently.</p>
               <p>Hetty watched him curiously.</p>
               <p>"Father, do <emph>you</emph> think praying makes any difference with things?"</p>
               <p>"I should not pray every day, Hetty, if it meant nothing. What strange idea have
                  you got in that curly head now?"</p>
               <p>Strange thoughts were rather plenty in Hetty's head. She was a true Yankee in that
                  she could take nothing on trust; she must see its reasonableness for herself.</p>
               <p>"Father, the minister often tells us that God foreordained every event before the
                  foundation of the world. Do you believe it?"</p>
               <p>"Sartainly I do. Ahem! Why, yes, I believe it, of course."</p>
               <p>"Then what is the use of praying about things?"</p>
               <p>"Mark," said the deacon, shortly, "have you been talking in this way to
                  Hetty?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir. I am puzzled often enough myself without troubling her with
                  contradictions."</p>
               <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6508-00000070"/>
               <p>"Hetty, have you read those Arminian tracts that Mark brought from Boston?"</p>
               <p>"No, father. I don't like to read well enough to go through those prosy
                  things."</p>
               <p>"Well, I guess it is time to see to the chores. Come, Mark."</p>
               <p>Mark and Hetty exchanged meaning smiles. "The chores" generally needed "seeing to"
                  when the deacon was cornered in argument.</p>
               <p>The young girl's problem was soon forgotten, for Mark and the deacon had scarcely
                  left the house before Joe Humphreys was seen approaching. All through the winter
                  he had been trying to obtain Hetty's favor without going to the expense of a
                  present, but had at last been obliged to succumb to necessity.</p>
               <p>"O, dear suz!" exclaimed Mistress Bowen as she caught a glimpse of him through the
                  window. "If there aint that pesky Joe! Why don't you tell him to stay away?"</p>
               <p>"Why don't you tell him, mother dear? He don't come to see me. At least he has
                  never said he did."</p>
               <p>Joe came in, dressed in his Sunday suit, his yellow hair greased and powdered and
                  tapered out in a wonderful cue that was tied with a red ribbon. He wore long
                  stockings and short breeches, with shining knee and shoe buckles, that he had
                  purchased during a visit to Boston.</p>
               <p>"He is a regular fop," Mrs. Bowen had said to Hetty only that morning after seeing
                  him show off in meeting. "All he thinks of is his clothes. I hope they are paid
                  for."</p>
               <p>"It isn't much of a debt if they are not," responded Hetty. "He is such a small
                  concern that a little cloth goes a long way in clothing him. As to his soul, it
                  will never be seen in the next world any more than in this. It aint big enough to
                  be visible even to spirits."</p>
               <p>On this evening he had ruffles in his shirt-bosom and around his wrists, and his
                  waistcoat was brilliant with gay colors. The figures of this last garment were
                  well designed, but it was impossible to judge of them inasmuch as they were too
                  large to appear whole in the pattern. He was, as a crowning charm, perfumed with
                  something that was strongly scented with musk.</p>
               <p>"For pity sake, open the door, somebody," exclaimed Hetty suddenly before Joe had
                  time to utter a word of greeting; "something smells awfully. Please, mother, raise
                  that window."</p>
               <p>Mistress Bowen hastened to obey, and also to get out of the room, for the effort
                  to keep from laughing nearly strangled her. She stayed out, not fancying the new
                  perfume herself; but the door being open, she could not help hearing the
                  conversation that followed. It did not help to sober her.</p>
               <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6508-00000071"/>
               <p>"I haven't seen you, Hetty, since a week ago, Sunday," drawled the young man.
                  "Seems an awful long time. I've been to Boston. Bought you something pretty. You
                  can't guess what it is. Let me give it to you now, afore the old folks come
                  in."</p>
               <p>"O my!" said Hetty, stepping back as he approached her, "what a smell! Do stay
                  where you are."</p>
               <p>"I've got a ring for you, Hetty."</p>
               <p>"What are they doing in Boston? Never mind the ring—that'll keep. Tell me what you
                  heard about the army. Is it true that the town is invested?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; shut in, as tight as a box. But what will it amount to? There are men coming
                  into the ranks all the time. Much as I could do to get through the lines. Had to
                  lie awfully. Pretended to belong to the Provincials. Told them my mother was
                  a-dying in the town, and had sent for me. Pretty cute, wasn't it?"</p>
               <p>"Not very. You are used to lying, Joe."</p>
               <p>The young man laughed, as if he was highly complimented.</p>
               <p>"You ought to see our army, as they call it—you really had. Such a set of ragged
                  scamps never got together in a bunch afore. Not a uniform among them. Then there's
                  General Ward and Putnam a-strutting round as if they owned the world. You would
                  laugh to hear them order the rest. Guess they'll change their tune when the
                  Government takes hold in earnest."</p>
               <p>"We shall see." Hetty set her lips firmly together in defiance of the
                  Government.</p>
               <p>"No doubt about that. Why, there were sixty-five of the royal forces killed at
                  Lexington, and nearly two hundred wounded. How long do you expect they'll stand
                  such things?"</p>
               <p>"Not a great while, because they'll get whipped and learn to behave themselves.
                  You don't seem to know that fifty of our best men were killed and the whole
                  country is in mourning. That is what is waking the folks up. They have borne about
                  all they will."</p>
               <p>"Wonder Capen Mark isn't stirring. He pretends to be so zealous. Always thought it
                  was more brag than spunk," said Joe, who never lost a chance of depreciating the
                  young patriot. The deepening color on Hetty's cheek warned him that he was
                  venturing upon dangerous ground. He changed the subject at once. "Now, look
                  a-here. See this ring. Aint it a beauty? Bought it on purpose for you. Let me try
                  it on."</p>
               <p>"No, I thank you. Just keep where the air will blow on you, if you want me to stay
                  in the room. I can't bear that smell an inch nearer."</p>
               <p>"It's only cologne-water and musk."</p>
               <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6508-00000072"/>
               <p>"I don't care what it is. It is enough to knock any body down."</p>
               <p>"But you'll take the ring, Hetty? It is pure gold. None of your imitations. It is
                  eighteen carats fine."</p>
               <p>"I don't care if it is eighteen parsnips," said Hetty; "I don't want it."</p>
               <p>"Wont ye take it as a present from me, Hetty?" pleaded the young man. "There's
                  lots of pretty girls would be glad to get it."</p>
               <p>"Give it to them, then. I'm sure they are welcome. When I take a present from a
                  Tory I shall have lost my senses. I should be ashamed to wear it."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you don't want me to come to see you any more," said Joe, looking as if
                  he was suggesting the most improbable thing in the world.</p>
               <p>"Well, to speak honestly, it <emph>would</emph> be quite as pleasant here without
                  you. I could have told you that last summer if I had thought that you came to see
                  me particularly."</p>
               <p>Joe's eyes snapped viciously. "Perhaps you think you can look higher. Keziah told
                  me that the doctor's son was down here last Sunday night. Trying to catch him,
                  a'n't ye? Guess you'll have to try one spell."</p>
               <p>Hetty was taken by surprise at his connecting her name with that of Ned Brown, the
                  doctor's son, but she would not gratify him by showing it.</p>
               <p>"Ah, well!" she said, "if I try as hard as I can, I shall not be to blame if I
                  don't succeed. I can't do more than my best."</p>
               <p>"Some folks say that you are looking nigher home," persisted Joe, his old jealousy
                  of Mark reviving. "You're fishing for Capen Mark, commander of the Ragged
                  Recruits, perhaps. They say he wont let you think of any body else."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Hetty, her eyes flashing, "suppose they say right, is it any body's
                  business?"</p>
               <p>"Guessed right, didn't I?" chuckled Joe maliciously; "hit the nail right on the
                  head. Wal, Capen Mark is—"</p>
               <p>"Capen Mark, as you call him,"interrupted Hetty, "will be in directly. If you are
                  here I shall ask him to show you the way out of doors, and he'll do it."</p>
               <p>Like all braggarts, Joe Humphreys was a coward. He took up his hat at once. "Hate
                  to leave ye so kind o' riled up, but any thing is better than a fuss.
                  Good-night."</p>
               <p>Hetty did not answer. Her self-control had deserted her. She was too angry to
                  speak, so, as soon as the door closed behind him she began to cry. Her mother came
                  in and attempted to soothe her, but she was herself<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000073"/> laughing hysterically, and could only jerk out an
                  occasional word between the paroxysms.</p>
               <p>"I never was so nearly tickled to death in all my life," she said afterward to the
                  deacon. "But I can't give you any idea of it. You should have been there."</p>
               <p>The two men were a little startled when they returned to the house. Hetty sat on a
                  low stool, convulsively sobbing, and over her stood Mistress Bowen, laughing
                  aloud, with both hands spread out, as if she were pronouncing a benediction.</p>
               <p>"Heavens and airth, mother!" exclaimed the deacon; "what's to pay now?"</p>
               <p>"It's Joe—, Joe—!" Not another word could the good woman utter.</p>
               <p>"She's gone crazy, Mark, as sure as you live. Well, this is <emph>real</emph>
                  trouble."</p>
               <p>His distress and alarm sobered her, but a look at Hetty nearly upset her
                  again.</p>
               <p>"Where is Joe?" asked Mark.</p>
               <p>"O, O! he's gone home, and I guess he'll never come here again."</p>
               <p>"Are you crying for that, Hetty?" Mark was puzzled to account for her emotion.</p>
               <p>"Why, no; I sent him off as mad as a hornet."</p>
               <p>"And these are tears of pleasure?"</p>
               <p>"Not exactly; I got mad, too, and—and I always cry when I am mad. It makes me feel
                  better," said Hetty, brightening into a laugh herself as she caught a comical look
                  from her mother. "O father! it was so funny, and so provoking, too. He said such
                  awful things about Ned Brown and me, and about Mark and me! I told him to be off,
                  or Mark would turn him out of doors."</p>
               <p>"That's true." Mark smiled as his quick mind comprehended the nature of Joe's
                  offense.</p>
               <p>"Mark," said the deacon, "if you ever see his yellow pate on my premises you
                  just—"The deacon stopped. He remembered in time that he was a deacon.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Mark, quietly completing the sentence; "I'll horsewhip him."</p>
               <p>All this Joe heard. He had crept round the house and stationed himself under the
                  south window, curious to know what the men would say about him after hearing
                  Hetty's story. He wanted to stay long enough to hear Mistress Bowen, who began to
                  recount the whole interview; but Mark's threat made him quake in his stockings at
                  the idea of being discovered.</p>
               <p>At the corner of the house he came upon Hetty's cat, a pretty gray creature with a
                  blue ribbon tied around her neck. "If I could kill that little varmint now, I
                  guess they wouldn't be quite so tickled," he said as a peal of merriment<pb
                     n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6508-00000074"/> ment came through the open window, and
                  showed that the ludicrous narrative lost nothing in telling. "Darn the whole lot!
                  Now, Miss Pussy, suppose you take an evening walk by the river. It will be real
                  romantic now."</p>
               <p>Alas! Miss Pussy had no romance in her nature. As he took her up she resented the
                  attention by the most spiteful spitting and yowling. In the plainest cat-language
                  she declined his attentions, and emphasized her remarks by a couple of deep
                  scratches on his face, and a variety of slighter marks on his hands. Nothing but
                  the necessity for silence kept Joe from screaming in concert with his sharp-clawed
                  adversary.</p>
               <p>"Wal," said he, as he watched the cat scud off to the barn, with her tail nearly
                  as large as her body, "I guess I'll go home."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">GETTING INTO HOT WATER.</head>
               <p>IF any of the descendants of Joe Humphreys should happen to read this history they
                  will not think it strange that, under the circumstances, Joe's love "kinder gin
                  eout." And if they inherit his peculiar characteristics, they will understand how
                  the passion of love, in its dying struggles, changed into what would have been a
                  passion of hate in a stronger nature, but in Joe was simply a low order of spite.
                  The first sentiment had not been intense enough to make him unhappy in its
                  disappointment, for Hetty had been a secondary consideration.</p>
               <p>"I don't care so much about the girl," he confessed to his mother. "She is a
                  high-tempered minx, and used to having her own way. Considerable of a job for any
                  body to break her in, and then she might kick out of the harness any minute. She's
                  as tricky as that pesky mare that she rides so much. Guess I'm well rid of her,"
                  said Joe with philosophic resignation.</p>
               <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6508-00000075"/>
               <p>"You can't get rid of a thing you never had," slyly suggested one of his
                  sisters.</p>
               <p>"Now, then, Kezzy, you shet up. If women <emph>could</emph> learn to mind their
                  own business there would be some peace in the world. But it is as natural for them
                  to meddle as it is to breathe."</p>
               <p>"You needn't flare up so, Joe. I am not to blame if Hetty did give you the mitten.
                  I told you she would have nothing to say to you. Any body could see that. Next
                  time, perhaps, you'll be willing to take a friendly warning."</p>
               <p>"I don't care two straws about Hett," said Joe candidly. "But the deacon's land
                     <emph>is</emph> a leetle extra. You know that, Kez, as well as I do. Have heard
                  you talk about the mowing down in that meadow hundreds of times. It jines right on
                  to father's, and the places ought to go together. It's a plaguey shame," said Joe,
                  going to the window and looking out ruefully upon the mowing-lot in question,
                  whose velvet greenness shone in the sunlight most invitingly. "Wal, if the British
                  beat (as they will, of course) it would be nothing more'n fair to take a rebel's
                  land and give it to folks that have stuck to the Government. Shouldn't wonder if I
                  owned it yet."</p>
               <p>It was a hopeful view of the subject, but it did not hinder him from carrying on a
                  system of retaliation; a course of sly, teasing actions that was harder to bear
                  than open war, because it could not be met without stooping to like meannesses. He
                  was too much afraid of Mark to attempt any thing great, but little things are
                  often more provoking than those of consequence. The sting of a gnat is very trying
                  to human patience. Hetty's pet chickens died one after another; the cloth that she
                  had woven and laid upon the grass to bleach was spirited away into the woods, and
                  not found until it was ruined with mildew; Sylph's saddle was soiled with stains
                  that could not be rubbed off, and her bridle was cut; and even the cat, less
                  fortunate than the first, suffered, not death, but the loss of her ears and tail.
                  No one could trace these evils to Joe, still no one doubted that he was the author
                  of them.</p>
               <p>"Never mind," replied Hetty, when Mark stormed and threatened to bring the
                  offender to sudden punishment, "any thing is better than to have him spending his
                  evenings here. We are rid of his presence at all events. That is something to be
                  thankful for."</p>
               <p>"The good-will of a dog is better than the ill-will," quoted Mrs. Bowen from her
                  list of domestic proverbs.</p>
               <p>"Just the opposite is true of Joe. He can't hurt us seriously," laughed Hetty.</p>
               <p>"I don't know. People who can't do any good<pb n="152-153"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000076"/> often have a wonderful faculty for doing evil. Joe
                  seems to have a talent that way."</p>
               <p>"He has a wholesome fear of my horsewhip now," said Mark; "but when I leave to
                  join the army (and I may be summoned any day) he will be more venturesome. You
                  will have trouble with him—especially if Uncle Bowen has to go too. The prospect
                  is that all loyal men will be needed."</p>
               <p>"Well, children, we wont borrow trouble. It will be time enough to cross the
                  bridge when we get to it," said the deacon wisely.</p>
               <p>They were nearer the bridge than they thought. In the beginning of June, several
                  ships filled with troops, commanded by Generals Howe, Clinton, and Burgoyne,
                  arrived from England. General Gage, encouraged by the resources thus placed at his
                  disposal, resolved on vigorous measures to subdue the restless population. He
                  issued a proclamation, promising his majesty's pardon to all rebels who would give
                  proof of their repentance by returning to their peaceful occupations, and
                  submitting quietly to the royal Government.</p>
               <p>This proclamation, so far from dismaying the people, only exasperated the feeling
                  of discontent, and again the militia assembled and surrounded Boston. To prevent
                  General Gage from retiring into the country, the Provincial generals resolved to
                  occupy Bunker's Hill, in Charlestown. A thousand men, under Colonels Prescott,
                  Stark, and Knowles, were dispatched upon this service on the evening of the
                  sixteenth of June.</p>
               <p>It was early in the morning of the fifteenth when Mark received a message from
                  Colonel Prescott himself, desiring him to bring his little company into the ranks
                  without delay. Very slight preparation was necessary where the call had been so
                  confidently expected.</p>
               <p>The home-leaving was necessarily a sad occasion. The loved ones were going on no
                  holiday excursion, but to brave death itself in the defense of liberty. Hetty was
                  inconsolable.</p>
               <p>"I had rather not have any country," she said with most unpatriotic fervor.
                  "What's the good of liberty when your friends are killed and can't enjoy it?"</p>
               <p>"There is no certainty of my being killed, Hetty," said Mark. "Look on the bright
                  side, little sister."</p>
               <p>"There is no certainty that you <emph>wont</emph> be killed, and there isn't any
                  bright side. I wish we were all Quakers."</p>
               <p>"That we might enjoy the privileges that other lives were periled for? That is
                  rather selfish, Hetty."</p>
               <p>"I don't care. I think it is awful wicked to<pb n="154-155"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000077"/> kill folks. You don't know whom you are shooting.
                  It may be one of the Lord's best children."</p>
               <p>"Now, Hetty, try to feel differently. It would not be half so hard to go if you
                  felt so eager for the right that you would cheerfully give you dearest to the
                  cause."</p>
               <p>"Well, I shall never feel like that. I don't want my friends shot down like dogs,
                  and I don't want them to murder other folks."</p>
               <p>"At least, Hetty, you will pray, will you not, for our success."</p>
               <p>"I shall pray for your safe return. I don't think I shall pray much about the war,
                  except that it may end. As to the rest of it, there will be plenty of good
                  Christians praying on both sides. One party is as likely to be heard as the other.
                  And if it is true," said Hetty, "that the whole affair is already decided up
                  above, there is small use in any body's praying about it."</p>
               <p>"O Hetty!" said Mark earnestly, "how can you always fall back upon that idea, that
                  all events are settled beforehand! We cannot understand such matters. But one
                  thing we know, and that is, that we do act of our own will, and are accountable
                  for our actions. And my experience tells me that God hears prayer. Hetty, it is
                  possible that we may never meet again. I want you to promise to trust more in the
                  infinite love and tender compassion of God. It will smooth your way and give you
                  peace. Let the mysteries alone, and come by yourself, and for yourself, directly
                  to him. Will you try?"</p>
               <p>"Mark, if you come safely out of this danger I will devote my life to the service
                  of God. I can't tell what I shall do if you are killed."</p>
               <p>"In that event remember, Hetty, that I trusted in him, and did not fear to die,
                  and so be sure to meet me in heaven."</p>
               <p>The tender solemnity of his manner awed her, and his profession of a living faith
                  silenced the reckless words that trembled on her tongue.</p>
               <p>"He is safe, living or dying," she thought, and was comforted by the thought.</p>
               <p>But, O! how dull and lonesome the house seemed after he was gone! The summer skies
                  were clear and beautiful, and all nature was decked in its loveliest array, but a
                  desolate gloom covered it all. Every thing wore the dark shadow of the national
                  conflict. Not even the brilliant conflict at Breed's Hill, which filled with
                  courage so many patriot hearts, brightened the picture for Hetty. She read over
                  the list of the killed and wounded with a shudder of horror. To her mind the
                  result did not pay for the many loving hearts bleeding because of it.</p>
               <p>"It will be our turn to mourn next," she said<pb n="156-157"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000078"/> disconsolately, when her father, noting the fact
                  that the English forces lost three times the number of men that fell in the
                  patriot army, exultantly asked how long the British could afford to fight at that
                  rate.</p>
               <p>"But all these men had mothers, and sisters, and perhaps wives, like our own men,
                  father. It will be terrible news to them. All their lives will be made dark. And
                  this is only the beginning. O father, I can't help it if you are angry with me for
                  saying it, but I do believe this fighting among people that have the Bible is
                  wicked, cruel work. I don't see how Christians can uphold it."</p>
               <p>"Mehetabel," said the deacon sternly, "I am ashamed of you! That ever a child of
                  mine should utter such cowardly words! I am glad you are a girl. If I had a son
                  whining round and throwing cold water on every thing, it would kill me. Don't you
                  see, you foolish child, that there is a principle involved in this struggle, and
                  that the future of our country depends upon the issue? I don't seek death, or want
                  to kill any body; but I would die a hundred times before I would submit to
                  voluntary slavery. So would Mark."</p>
               <p>In all his life her father had never spoken so harshly to her before. Hetty's face
                  paled and flushed nervously, and her voice trembled; but she answered resolutely,
                  "Father, all my life you have taught me to reverence the Bible. I have read it a
                  good deal since the country has been so stirred up, and it seems to me that the
                  New Testament is what Aunt Hannah calls it, 'a Gospel of Peace.' And there must be
                  some way to make things right without murder. It can't be that God means his
                  children to kill each other."</p>
               <p>Hetty's courage failed her as soon as she had made her declaration of peace
                  principles, and, girl-like, she broke down in a passionate burst of weeping.</p>
               <p>"Why, sakes alive!" exclaimed the deacon, his anger vanishing in a moment at the
                  sight of her tears, "what <emph>is</emph> the matter with my little girl? Come to
                  father, precious one! It is too bad for him to scold when she is so unhappy. Cheer
                  up, little one. She may say what she likes, and be a little Tory if she wants to,
                  if she will only stop crying and be happy."</p>
               <p>He looked so distressed as he bent over her, smoothing her glossy hair back from
                  her forehead with his great, rough hand, that Hetty was fain to wipe away her
                  tears and smile encouragingly.</p>
               <p>"There, there, pet. The crying has done you good. You will feel better for
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Yes, father; I needed a thunder-shower to<pb n="158-159"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000079"/> clear me up, and now I have had it. I don't know
                  how long it will last, so I will go to work and make hay while the sun
                  shines."</p>
               <p>He dismissed her with a kiss, but he turned anxiously to his wife after she left
                  the room. "What has come to her, mother? I never saw a girl so changed. She is not
                  a bit like our Hetty."</p>
               <p>"She is lonely without Mark, for one thing. I had no idea that she was so strongly
                  attached to him. His leaving home has upset her completely. But she will get over
                  it."</p>
               <p>"And if I go too, mother?" he said, with a keen glance into his wife's face.</p>
               <p>She grew as pale as Hetty had done, but she answered steadily, "If you go too, may
                  the blessing of God go with you. I will not hold you back if the country needs
                  you."</p>
               <p>The deacon drew a long sigh of relief. Not that he had expected opposition, but he
                  had not counted on such ready co-operation. He knew all the cares and labors that
                  would come heavily upon his "women folk" if they were left to struggle by
                  themselves for a livelihood; and he understood, too, the wearing anxiety that
                  would be far harder to bear than the added work. It was not until autumn, when
                  General Washington, having been appointed Commander-in-chief by the Continental
                  Congress at Philadelphia, assumed the direction of the troops, that the deacon
                  left home. Neither he nor Mark were so far from home but that they were often
                  heard from, and the messages were so hopeful that Hetty began to look with less
                  horror upon the chances of war. She was getting used to the situation, too, and
                  that helped, more than any thing else, to restore her natural cheerfulness.</p>
               <p>But the home matters put on a different aspect as soon as they were left by
                  themselves. Joe Humphreys chuckled mightily over their apparent helpless
                  condition. "Guess Miss Hett will catch it now," he said, rubbing his hands
                  gleefully. The old petty persecutions were renewed at once. The cows got out of
                  their pasture and strayed farther from home than such animals are likely to go
                  unless they are driven, and great gaps appeared in the fences that the deacon had
                  left in good condition. The cabbage-garden was ruined by the pigs, who, somehow,
                  found a way out of their pen, and a couple of stacks of hay down in the meadow
                  were burned.</p>
               <p>"The house will be burned next," said Mistress Bowen in dismay. "Joe is quite
                  capable of it, in my opinion."</p>
               <p>"He'll find me capable of attending to his case before long," answered Hetty,
                     angrily<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6508-00000080"/> "I wont submit to such
                  impertinences. I'll find a chance to scare his little cowardly soul out. He hasn't
                  the spunk of a mosquito. If he had, he would do his mischief in the daytime, when
                  folks are up and awake, instead of prowling around in the dark."</p>
               <p>The opportunity to retaliate was close at hand, and Hetty was not slow to take
                  advantage of it. That very night she was lying awake, listening to the soft,
                  regular breathing of her mother, and wondering what new vexation the morning would
                  disclose, when she was startled by a faint, rustling sound at the end door. The
                  night was perfectly still, rendering the slightest noise audible. Hetty sat up in
                  bed and listened intently. The noise continued, but she could not make out its
                  character. Slipping carefully out of bed so as not to disturb her mother, she
                  stole noiselessly up the back stairs to an open window directly over the door, and
                  cautiously putting her head out she saw Joe distinctly. He was standing on the
                  door-step, and was busily employed in tying up the door with what seemed to be a
                  clothes-line.</p>
               <p>"So that is the game," thought Hetty. "Well, you work away a few minutes longer
                  and I'll help you."</p>
               <p>There was always a kettle of hot water left simmering over the kitchen-fire. "It
                  may be needed, and it does no hurt," Mistress Bowen would say.</p>
               <p>It was the work of but a moment for Hetty to slip down stairs and fill a pitcher
                  with the hot water, which she carried carefully up to the window, and very
                  deliberately poured out upon the miscreant below. A smothered scream, and a
                  muttered imprecation, told that her aim had been a true one. Then she saw Joe
                  start off on a run toward home.</p>
               <p>"There!" said Hetty, shutting the window decidedly, "I think we shall have peace
                  for a few days. Then, if he wants another lesson he had better try again."</p>
               <p>Fifty years afterward, when her grandchildren gathered around Hetty and begged for
                  stories of the Revolutionary period, there was no incident that she recounted so
                  often as this feat of scalding the Tory, Joe. She seems never to have had any
                  misgivings as to the propriety of the act.</p>
               <p>She was astonished on returning to bed to find that her mother had not been
                  awakened. "I am glad of it. It might trouble her," she thought as she crept into
                  bed by her side. "She must not be fretted if I can help it. Father told me to take
                  care of her, and I will," said Hetty, stoutly.</p>
               <p>Early in the morning, before sunrise, they<pb n="162-163"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000081"/> were aroused by a loud rapping on the front door.
                  Hetty dressed herself as rapidly as possible, while her mother wondered "who on
                  earth had come at that hour?"</p>
               <p>It was Keziah Humphreys. "Dear me!" she exclaimed as she came in, "how sound you
                  sleep! I've pounded on all the doors and windows till I'm tired."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Mistress Bowen, "we do sleep pretty sound. The deacon used to wake
                  me, and I called Hetty, and now we have to wake ourselves. It isn't very late in
                  the morning now. What sent you out so early?"</p>
               <p>"There's something ails our Joe. He called mother up in the middle of the night,
                  and she has been trying to do for him, but she don't know what to do. He was took
                  amazing sudden. Went to bed as well as he ever was, and before one o'clock he was
                  so distressed he had to rout mother."</p>
               <p>"How does he seem?"</p>
               <p>"O! I can't tell you. He is broke out all over his face and hands, and he can't
                  keep still a minute. Looks like water-blisters as much as any thing. Some of them
                  are as big as the palm of my hand. Mother wants you to come over and see it."</p>
               <p>"Why don't you send for Dr. Paris?"</p>
               <p>"He wont have a doctor. He don't know I came after you, and you mustn't tell him.
                  Just happen in by and by, after breakfast, on some errand. I must hurry back
                  before he misses me."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Mistress Bowen, "I'll soon come over."</p>
               <p>Hetty had not said a word, but she trembled so visibly that it attracted the
                  notice of Keziah, who said to herself as she went across the fields toward home,
                  "Shouldn't wonder a bit if Hetty likes him, after all."</p>
               <p>It was hard work for Hetty to listen to her mother's comments after Keziah left:
                  "What <emph>do</emph> you suppose is the matter? They have got the small-pox over
                  in Dorchester, but it don't break out at first. I hope it isn't any thing
                  catching."</p>
               <p>"I guess it isn't much any way. You know the Humphreys are all frightened to death
                  if any thing threatens Joe. He wont die yet, mother dear, because he was born to
                  be hung." Hetty laughed nervously.</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear," said her mother, "I don't wish for any one to suffer, but if Joe
                  can have a kind of comfortable sickness that will keep him at home nights a spell,
                  I shall be quite resigned for one."</p>
               <p>It seemed to Hetty as if her mother would never get ready to go. She longed to be
                     alone<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6508-00000082"/> in the house, so that she
                  could scream out the laughter that struggled for utterance. If her mother could
                  have looked into the kitchen half an hour after her departure she would have
                  thought Hetty was crazy. She sat there with the tears streaming down her cheeks,
                  in a paroxysm of merriment. "To think of their sending for mother!" she said. "O
                  dear! if I don't die of laughing before she gets home, I certainly shall when she
                  tells me how he looks." But when Mistress Bowen returned she had no description to
                  give.</p>
               <p>"He wouldn't see me, Hetty. He said he would go straight out of doors if I came
                  into the room. I told his mother he was too contrary to die. Why, Hetty, child,
                  have you been crying?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—no—that is, I have laughed till I cried. O mother dear! it is so funny. Joe
                  is scalded. I did it myself. No wonder he wouldn't see you."</p>
               <p>Mistress Bowen was too much astonished to ask questions. Hetty pulled out the
                  easy-chair for her, and took off her out-door wraps, and then, when she was
                  settled comfortably, gave her a glowing account of her last night's exploit. Her
                  mother listened to it with breathless attention.</p>
               <p>Not a word of reproof did she utter. On the contrary, she seemed to enjoy the
                  performance nearly as well as Hetty did. "There will be no bounds to his hate
                  now," she said at last.</p>
               <p>"I think I can manage him," replied Hetty confidently.</p>

               <head type="sub">FUSS AND RUBY.</head>
               <p>IT was a vain boast that Hetty made when she declared herself equal to managing
                  Joe. She soon found out her mistake. In open warfare she would doubtless have been
                  his match, but in contriving petty ways to aggravate and inconvenience he was
                  vastly more ingenious. As soon as his burns healed he was more active than ever.
                  He kept at a safe distance from the house, but on a large farm there are many
                  opportunities for mischief if one gives his whole mind to it, as Joe did.</p>
               <p>Mistress Bowen grew nervous. She was worried and perplexed by day, and her sleep
                  at night was troubled with dreams of the many evils that she dreaded. She began to
                  grow thin and pale with anxiety.</p>
               <p>"It is not so much what he does that troubles me, as the dread of what he may do,"
                  she said when Hetty tried to laugh away her fears. "I never feel easy about you if
                  you are out of my sight. Strange that he can be so malicious!"</p>
               <p>At last, after much worrying, Mistress Bowen had what she always called "an
                  inspiration." It came in the early morning after a particularly restless night.
                  All the clouds passed away at once, and she saw her way clearly.</p>
               <p>"Wake up, Hetty!" she exclaimed joyously; "I have got a bright idea in my head
                  now, if I ever had one in my life. Wake up!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, mother dear," answered Hetty sleepily, quite willing to take the bright idea
                  on trust.</p>
               <p>"But you must wake up, my child, and help me about it. Dear heart! Isn't she a
                  picture?" said the mother fondly.</p>
               <p>Charming as Hetty was when awake, with all the changes of expression peculiar to
                  her, she was, to the mother's eye, far more beautiful when asleep. There was a
                  childlike purity in the whole face. The mischievous sparkle of the dark eyes was
                  shut in by the heavy curling lashes that rested softly on the round, blooming
                  cheek. Awake, she was the courageous young woman upon whom the mother
                  unconsciously leaned; asleep, the innocent baby came back to her arms.</p>
               <p>"To think of her being so tormented by that—that mean toad," said the fond mother,
                  to whom the inelegant comparison seemed far too good for its subject. "Now, Hetty,
                  just wake up for a minute. How sleepy she is!"</p>
               <p>"What is it, mother?"</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6508-00000084"/>
               <p>"It is something good—something you will like."</p>
               <p>The dark eyes opened eagerly. "Has Mark come home, or father?"</p>
               <p>"No, it isn't that kind of news; I wish it were. It will be a long time, I fear,
                  before I can tell you that."</p>
               <p>"It is so lonesome, mother dear!" Hetty looked out at the gray sky, which was not
                  a very inspiring sight at that early hour.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know it is."</p>
               <p>"And Joe acts so! He's fretting you to death."</p>
               <p>"His time is short, Hetty. That is what I want to talk about. I am going to get
                  Fuss and Ruby to come over here and stay all winter."</p>
               <p>"O mother!" Hetty clapped her hands with delight. "Why didn't we think of it
                  before?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know I am sure. It came to me all at once. I was thinking of your father,
                  and that he had engaged Fuss to see about killing and salting down the beef and
                  pork for winter, when this plan came in. It was an inspiration, Hetty?"</p>
               <p>"When will you have him come?"</p>
               <p>"This very day. I am not going to worry so another night. I want you to go over
                  there the first thing, or he may be off fishing. Tell him all about that—that
                  varmint, and just how we are situated. He'll come."</p>
               <p>"Of course he will."</p>
               <p>"And tell him to bring one of the dogs." I do wonder, Hetty, that we have not been
                  bright enough to keep a dog."</p>
               <p>"Good! I'll tell him to bring big Jupe."</p>
               <p>"Don't hurry so. Take time to dress you warmly. Put on your red cloak. The air is
                  chilly these frosty mornings. The sun is just coming up, but it will be cool for
                  hours. Will you ride?"</p>
               <p>"No, I had rather go through the woods. They are glorious now."</p>
               <p>Before we go through the woods with Hetty we will find out a little more about
                  Fuss and Ruby. They had been slaves, who had belonged to the deacon's mother, but
                  had been freed by him directly after her death.</p>
               <p>"My religion will not let me own slaves," he said, and so he had given them a few
                  acres of land down by the shore, and had helped build a small house for them to
                  live in.</p>
               <p>New England never was a congenial soil for slavery. There is a snuff of freedom in
                  those piercing easterly winds that penetrate like a sword to one's very marrow.
                  Yet some of our forefathers tried it. The cruelties of slavery, known in later
                  times, seem never to have been<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6508-00000085"/>
                  practiced by them. The peace-loving Quakers at Newport were the principal
                  importers of slaves, sending out at one time fifty-nine vessels laden with rum to
                  exchange for the human freight. Very soon after the war a law was made limiting
                  the time of servitude to ten years, and this was followed by another forbidding
                  the importation of slaves. So the evil soon worked its own cure, and all the
                  dwellers on New England soil became as free as its pine-clad hills.</p>
               <p>There were very few slaves in Massachusetts in the deacon's time. Fuss was about
                  his own age. They had played together as children, and their boyish sports and
                  labors had laid the foundation for a life-long affection.</p>
               <p>Fuss had been married to Ruby several years, and was the proud father of a couple
                  of jet-black heirs to his estate when the deacon brought home his wife. His name
                  was originally Josephus, but it had been gradually abbreviated, until only the
                  last syllable remained, and he was known every-where in the town as Fuss Bowen.
                  Nothing could exceed his devotion to the deacon and to the deacon's family. Ruby
                  shared the feeling in its fullest extent, and there was no personal sacrifice that
                  she would not have rejoiced in if it had added to their comfort.</p>
               <p>In person Fuss was a most imposing negro, of herculean size and strength, without
                  a shade of yellow to relieve the utter darkness of his complexion. If it had been
                  the fashion then to frighten children into a sense of duty by threatening to call
                  "the big black man," he would have answered well for a bugbear.</p>
               <p>As it was, children were generally afraid of him, and he had been the one terror
                  of Joe Humphrey's life. Fuss took no pains to lessen this feeling, for, as he
                  expressed it, "If there is any airthly thing that goes agin my stomach it is that
                  yaller-headed fool."</p>
               <p>Fuss looked upon Hetty with almost adoring reverence. She was a marvel of beauty
                  in his eyes. He declared to Ruby his private opinion that she was "just an angel
                  strayed away from heaven," and all later years had but confirmed him in this
                  belief. So it will be seen that the "inspiration" of Mistress Bowen was likely to
                  secure for Hetty a protector against Joe's malice.</p>
               <p>Hetty set out on her walk in high spirits. A ramble in the woods was always an
                  especial treat to her, and her delight was not lessened by the pleasant errand now
                  connected with it. It was a fresh, breezy morning in October, and the woods were
                  in the full glory of their autumnal beauty. It was the true Indian summer, with
                  its soft haze softening and refining<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6508-00000086"/>
                  the brilliant frost-coloring. The yellow birches and crimson maples contrasted
                  strongly with the ever-green pines, that grew more luxuriantly than any other
                  trees along the gentle slopes, crowning the cliffs that hung over the deep, mossy
                  basins, whence the decayed leaves sent out that faint, spicy aroma that is never
                  breathed outside of the forest. There were rough hills outlined in the distance,
                  but they were mellowed to the view by the morning mist, which wrapped their
                  summits in the softest shades of violet and gray.</p>
               <p>All this Hetty saw as she crossed the low pasture between the house and the woods.
                  Just after entering the woods she came to a rapid little brook, now dignified with
                  the name of river, over which Mark had built a rustic bridge years ago. Standing
                  on this bridge she could look far up the stream, and watch its progress as it came
                  dashing down the rocky way from its fountain away among the hills.</p>
               <p>It was a most beautiful spot. In the fresh morning-time the water seemed to put on
                  a new loveliness, and went sparkling along its way like a thing of joyous life.
                  Over the bridge great oak-trees interlaced their branches, yet bright with the
                  green that had made their summer beauty, and with long tufts of pea-green mosses
                  drooping from the dark trunks.</p>
               <p>On the banks were sweet-smelling hazels and the fiery rubies of the elder; the
                  crimson sumach and the golden-rod shone like an embodied sunset behind the
                  feathery ferns and reeds that fringed the margin; the wild frost-grapes hung out
                  their short purple clusters of fruit from the clinging vine-stems, whose foliage
                  had departed, and the graceful red raspberry-stems twined like tiny ribbons among
                  the bitter-sweet berries and the black beads of the wild woodbine.</p>
               <p>The woods were quite still, save the faint rustling of the falling leaves, for the
                  birds had left their summer haunts long ago. As she tripped gayly on a squirrel
                  occasionally crossed her path, stopping a moment, with its bushy tail aloft, like
                  an umbrella, to dart a glance of inquiry at the intruder, then speeding away to
                  his day's harvesting among the walnuts and acorns.</p>
               <p>Looking out upon the same locality now one cannot recognize the scene. The trees
                  have been cut down, the rocks—many of them—removed to serve as foundations for
                  houses, and even the course of the river changed. There are smooth pasture-lands
                  and houses all along its banks, and dirty factories sit astride of its clear
                  waters. It was a pity to so spoil its rustic beauty, but it was spoiled a little
                  at a time, and<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6508-00000087"/> the change was scarcely
                  observed until it was accomplished.</p>
               <p>The path beyond the brook was so little trodden that an unaccustomed eye would
                  have failed to find it, but Hetty threaded her way with a confident step. Every
                  inch of ground, and every shrub, rock, and tree, was familiar.</p>
               <p>In the middle of the wood she paused a moment to pity a solitary robin that,
                  disinclined to foreign travel, had chosen to keep house alone during the coming
                  winter. It was quite tame, and chirped a melancholy response to her sympathy.</p>
               <p>"O you foolish birdie! Why didn't you go with your brothers and sisters? A sad
                  time you will have here by yourself. The winter is coming, did you know it?"</p>
               <p>The robin shrugged up his shoulders until his head was almost lost to view, thus
                  expressing his contempt for borrowed trouble. Why, the trees were full of seeds,
                  and the spiders and bugs were too lazy to creep out of his reach. He thought he
                  knew what he was about.</p>
               <p>"It will be different in a few weeks," said Hetty, her eye taking in all the
                  present accommodations for bird-life. "There will be snow and ice all over the
                  ground, and the biting winds will freeze you. I wonder what you will find to eat
                  then. If you will come to the house I will feed you; but I fear you will not be
                  wise enough to do that. You will certainly starve to death here. There will be no
                  one to blame but yourself if you do."</p>
               <p>The robin did not seem in the least dismayed by this doubtful picture. He was
                  evidently willing to abide by the resources at his command, so Hetty reluctantly
                  left him to his chosen solitude.</p>
               <p>It was still early in the morning when Hetty came out into the clearing where Fuss
                  lived. A thin belt of savin-trees grew quite up to the back of the low cabin,
                  hiding the view in that direction, but in front the blue waters of the cove
                  afforded a wide prospect. They were bright with the changing tints of the morning,
                  and the steadily recurring waves rocked with ceaseless motion two boats that were
                  tied to the shore. These belonged to Fuss, who, with his son, obtained a living by
                  fishing.</p>
               <p>There was nothing particularly striking in this view. The cove was bordered by no
                  wild gorges and precipices, yet it contrasted very pleasantly with the woodland
                  depths behind. It had its seasons of sublimity, when the waters were lashed into
                  fury by the storms; but most people would prefer its usual aspect of placid
                  loveliness.</p>
               <p>Hetty had no time to contemplate its beauty,<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000088"/> for a trio of dogs came bouncing out of a low shed
                  near the house, growling and barking, as if an army were invading the premises. At
                  the same moment the big, good-natured face of Fuss appeared in the doorway, with
                  Ruby's phiz peering out under his arm, to ascertain the cause of the uproar. Both
                  faces lighted up with pleased surprise as they espied their visitor.</p>
               <p>"Land o' goodnes!" exclaimed Ruby, darting back into the house to speak to her
                  daughter. "It is little miss. Put on a table-cloth, Cynthy, and the best dishes.
                  She must stay to eat breakfast. And fry some fish."</p>
               <p>The dogs recognized Hetty, for she was no stranger in the cabin, and they ran
                  around her, snuffing at her dress, giving short yelps of delight, and wagging
                  their tails as if they held the secret of perpetual motion. There was always a
                  well-understood sympathy between Hetty and the brute creation. So glad were the
                  dogs to see her that Fuss found some difficulty in relieving her from their
                  attentions.</p>
               <p>"Never mind the puppies, uncle," said she, laughing, as big Jupe, her favorite
                  among them, nearly knocked her down in his affectionate zeal. "They do not trouble
                  me at all. Where's Aunt Ruby?"</p>
               <p>"She was here a minute ago. Guess she's looking after the breakfast."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'm not going home without mine. I can smell aunty's corn-cakes, and I know
                  they are good."</p>
               <p>"You'll be welcome, missy. You know that without being told. If my woman were
                  clear down in the well with borrying trouble, she would come up all right if I
                  should holler, 'Little missy is here.' You just come in the house and see."</p>
               <p>Twenty years after, when Hetty was a matronly wife with a troop of noisy children
                  calling her mother, she was still "Little Missy" to her colored friends. She never
                  outgrew her youth or her pet name with them.</p>
               <p>Ruby came forward to greet her with her whole face radiant with smiles. Cynthy,
                  more retiring, irradiated the background with silent grins of welcome.</p>
               <p>"Sit right down, missy. Cynthy, you haul out that ere low chair. There, lean back
                  in that and try to rest yourself. You must be powerful tired a-tramping through
                  the woods. Put yer feet on this ere cricket, and let Cynthy take off your
                  cloak."</p>
               <p>"I am not tired, Aunt Ruby. It is only play to walk in the woods now. What are you
                  cooking? I am hungry enough to eat any thing. I wonder if mother will expect me
                  back to breakfast?"</p>
               <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6508-00000089"/>
               <p>"Can't help it if she does. I am frying some fish. Jake caught them last night.
                  Fuss was calculatin' to fetch you some afore noon. Guess you don't get them fresh
                  so often now as you did when the men folks were at home."</p>
               <p>"No. Mother is afraid to have me go out alone. I rowed out a little ways last
                  Saturday, and she worried so about me that it made her sick."</p>
               <p>"No wonder. You see you are all she has now the deacon is gone. You had better
                  stay ashore. I guess we can find ye in fish. Jake a'n't good for nothing
                  else."</p>
               <p>Hetty saw that although her humble hosts were too respectful to ask questions, yet
                  they were full of curiosity as to the reason of her early visit. So she turned to
                  Fuss.</p>
               <p>"Sit down here, uncle. I have a long story to tell you, and I can't talk to you
                  when your head is away up in the air. I wonder how you ever managed to grow so
                  big," said Hetty, admiring, as she always did, the well-built frame of the
                  kind-hearted giant.</p>
               <p>"Forgot to stop growing, missy," answered Fuss with a satisfied laugh, for he was
                  proud of his size and strength.</p>
               <p>"Well, I'm glad you didn't stop, for we need the whole of you over to our house
                  now. Let me tell you about it before we begin to eat, for I want to give my mind
                  to the breakfast and enjoy it."</p>
               <p>Fuss sat down, and listened attentively. At first with a feeling of amusement over
                  Joe's frequent discomfitures, but that gradually gave place to stern indignation
                  as she recounted the various annoyances to which they were subjected. He brought
                  his clenched fist down on the table with a force that set every dish to
                  dancing.</p>
               <p>"Don't break the table, daddy," said Cynthy, steadying as she spoke a bowl of milk
                  that was near the edge.</p>
               <p>"I wish it was that scamp's neck," responded Fuss angrily.</p>
               <p>"Why, I allus thought," said Ruby, who had been listening with all her might,
                  "that the Humphreys family were good neighbors."</p>
               <p>"They are, all but Joe. That is why mother does not complain of him. She don't
                  like to make them feel unpleasantly."</p>
               <p>"Tories, a'n't they?"</p>
               <p>"I don't think the women trouble themselves to be any thing. The old man isn't
                  much any way. Good enough in his way, perhaps, but all he cares for is to live
                  easy. Joe is too spiteful to do that."</p>
               <p>"What's got into him? He used to be friendly, didn't he?"</p>
               <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6508-00000090"/>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>Hetty colored rosily. She did not like to explain why Joe had changed. There was
                  no need. Her quick-witted hearers understood without it.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," said Fuss. "I sees it all. Allus thought he was a fool. Know he is
                  now. So yer ma wants me and Ruby to come over to stay?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; all winter. That is if Cynthia and Jake can spare you."</p>
               <p>Hetty looked doubtfully at the young colored girl, who would be left in
                  comparative solitude by this arrangement. Cynthia seemed to read her thoughts.</p>
               <p>"Laws-a-massy!" they can go just as well as not. Should like to get a chance to be
                  alone and think. Jake isn't much company. He almost lives on the water. Went off
                  this morning long afore light. But the dogs is allus here. You can depend on them.
                  They is just as good company as folks, and there's no danger o' my being hurt when
                  they're around."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Cynthy. You see we need your father, don't you?"</p>
               <p>"Should think you did. If <emph>you</emph> don't, that tow-headed Joe does.
                  Daddy'll see to <emph>his</emph> case," said Cynthy with a chuckle of intense
                  enjoyment.</p>

               <p>"He'll come, in course. Couldn't do without him. I shall send him back with you,
                  missy. There's no knowing what that Joe would do if he met you alone."</p>
               <p>"I'm not a bit afraid of him."</p>
               <p>"That may be. Tell your ma that Ruby and I will be along afore night. I want to
                  see to things here a little, and I must clean my gun. I may need it."</p>
               <p>"Why, uncle! You don't mean to shoot Joe?"</p>
               <p>"Wal, not exactly, cos his hide wouldn't bring a sixpence. But if he comes
                  sneakin' round, I'm feared he'll get powerful skeered."</p>
               <p>"Now, aunty, let me have some breakfast. I must hurry home, or mother will be sure
                  some evil has befallen me."</p>
               <p>It was amusing to see Fuss commit Hetty to the care of his great dog.</p>
               <p>"Look a-here, Jupe. Do you see missy?"</p>
               <p>Jupe responded by licking her hand rapturously.</p>
               <p>"Down with yer dirty paws! You need not eat her. You go home with her and take
                  care of her till I come. Do you hear, sir?"</p>
               <p>Jupe wagged his tail vehemently, and turned his bright, intelligent eyes from his
                  master to Hetty and back again.</p>
               <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6508-00000092"/>
               <p>"Do you think he knows what you say, uncle?"</p>
               <p>"Sartain he does. He'll stick by you now till I tell him to leave, just as if you
                  were a basket of goods. If I shouldn't come over for a week, that dog would keep
                  close to your heels. He knows all about it. I shouldn't like to be in the fellow's
                  skin that would try to hurt you."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, Jupe, we'll be off. Aunt Ruby, when you come over, just stop a minute
                  on the bridge and see the trees up the stream."</p>
               <p>"Cynthy and I was over there yesterday. We was digging sassifax-roots and
                  winter-green."</p>
               <p>"Is it not beautiful?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; s'pose so. But we didn't see any thing half so pretty as our little missy is
                  this very minute," said Ruby, gazing admiringly into the bright, eager face before
                  her.</p>
               <p>Hetty laughed merrily. She was used to their honest flattery, and only thought of
                  it as an evidence of their affection.</p>
               <p>Before she was half way through the wood, she was able to appreciate the foresight
                  of Fuss in sending Jupe as her companion. She became aware that some one else was
                  taking the morning air, and that the some one else was also trying to keep out of
                  her sight.</p>
               <p>Now, it had happened that at the time Mistress Bowen had received her
                  "inspiration," Joe Humphreys, in his warm bed at home, tossing restlessly in his
                  desire to invent some new trick of annoyance, was favored with a bright thought
                  directly from the lower regions. He recollected that the stream of water that
                  flowed down by the deacon's barn, and afforded a convenient watering-place for the
                  cattle, had its source up among the hills, half a mile away. Now, Joe did not like
                  to work. It was nearly impossible for his sisters to get him to do the lightest
                  chores; but he never shirked any labor in the way of mischief. The plan of
                  building a dam that should turn the water in a different direction, and so oblige
                  Hetty and her mother to draw water for the animals, was so delightful, so far
                  beyond any of his previous feats, that he could hardly wait to dress himself
                  before setting off to select a fitting place to carry out his project. He was
                  returning leisurely down the river when he was startled by the loud barking of a
                  dog, and the next moment saw Hetty herself plainly enough to recognize her, though
                  she was half hidden among the trees.</p>
               <p>"O, my goodness gracious!" said Joe, looking round for a chance to hide; "whatever
                  shall I do? That great brute of a dog will nose me out, and Hetty wont hinder him
                  if he half kills me. O dear! I wish I had stayed at home."</p>
               <p>Hetty was not long in doubt as to the figure<pb n="186-187"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000093"/> that went dodging about from bush to rock, in the
                  vain hope of keeping out of sight. She was not afraid of him. If she had been
                  alone, she would have fearlessly met him. She knew his courage would not stand a
                  moment against open opposition. His forte lay in petty acts of meanness, in
                  insulting words, and teasing doings that were all the legitimate fruits of
                  cowardice.</p>
               <p>We must pardon her if she did exult in her present power to frighten him. Every
                  time that he changed his position, Jupe put up his nose and barked furiously. She
                  mischievously took the paths that approached him, dislodging him from his
                  hiding-places before he had well fixed himself in them, apparently unconscious of
                  his presence near her, though Jupe's deep growls and yelps increased, until the
                  woods resounded with frightful echoes.</p>
               <p>On the foot-bridge she stopped. Joe had just slipped under the cover of a
                  savin-bush close to the bank, and he lay there cowering in bodily fear not ten
                  paces from her.</p>
               <p>"What a lovely spot to sing in!" said Hetty. "Now, Jupe, you stop singing, and
                  give me a chance."</p>
               <p>There could be nothing sweeter than Hetty's voice as it swelled out on the clear
                  woodland air. And there surely was never a prettier picture than she made in her
                  scarlet cloak, and with her long dark hair floating over her shoulders. Joe was
                  not insensible to this as he peeped through the bushes.</p>
               <p>"She's deuced harnsome and no mistake," he thought ruefully. "And the deacon's
                  farm is the best in the town. It is too all-fired mean to lose them both."</p>
               <p>When her song was finished Hetty walked leisurely homeward, Jupe still growling
                  discontentedly, and Joe was left to his own reflections.</p>
               <p>"I say, that's what <emph>I</emph> call a narrer escape!" said he as he made the
                  best of his way across the fields toward home. "Wonder if she is going to keep
                  that dog? If she does, my game is up. Whew! if she had seen me, and set that great
                  dog on me, I might as well give up all thoughts of building the dam. She would be
                  sure to look it up, and bring that dog with her. If I only <emph>could</emph> get
                  hold of her horse! I could sell it for a good price, besides plaguing Hett. That
                  dog belongs to the nigger, Fuss. Wal, I never! Sartain, I never did!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <head type="sub">A LETTER FROM CAMP.</head>
               <p>A MONTH now passed by without any event of particular interest, during which all
                  the friendly gossips in the neighborhood had time to discuss the odd plans of
                  Mistress Bowen, and to speculate as to whether it would be likely to pay well to
                  keep four people where two only were needed; for Mistress Bowen made no pretense
                  of needing Fuss and Ruby as help.</p>
               <p>"Those two niggers will eat their weight before spring," prophesied the wise
                  people.</p>
               <p>Then the approach of the annual Thanksgiving-day set the conversational energies
                  of the gossips into a different channel. It was too busy a season in most farmers'
                  families to admit of outside interests.</p>
               <p>There were many who had but little heart to prepare for the great Puritan
                  festival. All over the town there were mothers and wives sitting with anxious
                  hearts by lonely firesides. It seemed to them a sad mockery of joy to fill the
                  wide pantry-shelves with dainties, while the absent sent beloved ones were
                  enduring the privations of the camp.</p>
               <p>"O, mother! please do not cook a thing different from our usual fare," pleaded
                  Hetty, when Fuss asked how many chickens should be fatted especially for that
                  occasion. "The day will seem like a funeral any way. Do, mother dear, let us
                  forget that there ever were any Thanksgiving days."</p>
               <p>"We can do better than that, Hetty," said the mother cheerfully. "We will cook
                  more than usual instead of less, and then we will send Fuss with a big load of it
                  all to your father and Mark. What do you think of that plan?"</p>
               <p>Hetty jumped up from her seat, and throwing her arms around her mother's neck,
                  kissed her half a dozen times in rapturous delight.</p>
               <p>"Don't, Hetty, for mercy's sake! You hug like a young bear."</p>
               <p>"Can't help it. Wont it be grand, though! How did you come to think of it? It will
                  be worth while to cook after all. This is one of your 'inspirations,' mother
                  dear."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps so. We will begin in season, so that we can send it the day before
                  Thanksgiving. We will roast turkeys—and we have some that are worth eating if we
                     <emph>did</emph> raise them. We will make chicken-pies, and every other kind of
                  pie that we can think of. I should like to send<pb n="190-191"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000095"/> at least a bushel of doughnuts. You must make
                  these. Fuss must kill the hogs the first of the week, so that we can put in some
                  fresh meat. And we must not forget a good supply of cheese. Mark is a master hand
                  for cheese."</p>
               <p>"So is father. And they both like apples."</p>
               <p>"We will send a barrel of the best we have. There is no danger of sending too
                  much, for there are plenty of hungry mouths besides our own men."</p>
               <p>"You will never know where to send it," suggested Hetty, doubtfully. "The troops
                  are all along the heights from Roxbury to Mystic Bridge. That is what Jim Bates
                  said. He had quite a job to find his brother."</p>
               <p>"But he saw Mark at Cambridge, where he and your father are staying at present. I
                  thought you heard him say so."</p>
               <p>"No. I heard him say that the troops made a line twelve miles long, and I have
                  been traveling up and down that line in my imagination ever since. What else did
                  he say about them?"</p>
               <p>"They were well, that is all. He only saw Mark a minute. There was no time to send
                  messages. But it is worth every thing to hear that they are well."</p>
               <p>Whatever the neighbors might have thought in their wisdom, it is certain that
                  neither Hetty nor her mother had any idea of living easily, as to labor, when Fuss
                  and Ruby were added to the household. The days and evenings were absolutely
                  crowded with work. It is true that Fuss attended to the out-door affairs, which
                  had fallen rather heavily on their unaccustomed hands, and Ruby industriously
                  washed and ironed and scrubbed and cooked in the kitchen. The old-fashioned
                  cooking was more simple, and occupied far less time than ours.</p>
               <p>A hundred years ago the New England farmers did not get up to a breakfast of hot
                  muffins, beefsteak, and toast, with pies and cakes to top off with. The coffee and
                  chocolate that are indispensable now were scarcely thought of except at Christmas
                  or Thanksgiving time; and tea, during the war, was an unknown luxury. Yet the diet
                  of those days was both wholesome and abundant.</p>
               <p>The morning meal consisted of hasty-pudding and milk; that and nothing more. Did
                  you ever make a meal of this anti-dyspeptic dish? If not, you have an exquisite
                  pleasure, in the way of taste, in store for you.</p>
               <p>We don't pretend to know it at all by its slimy-sounding nickname, <hi rend="i"
                  />mush; neither do we believe in it under its French cognomen, <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">polante.</foreign> The Dutch appellation, <foreign
                     xml:lang="DUT">suppawn,</foreign> is no better. None of them express the thing.
                  It is a dish that is cooked in haste, served in haste, and<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000096"/> usually swallowed in haste, thereby earning its
                  true name, hasty-pudding. This has a significance to the Yankee ear, and a
                  temptation for the Yankee palate that no "mush" could convey.</p>
               <p>It was made fresh every morning. There was no saving of the cold, clammy remains
                  to be fried over in grease, and deluged with syrup or molasses. Hasty-pudding was
                  eaten, as it ought to be, in pure, rich milk, fresh from the cow—<emph>real</emph>
                  milk, without any admixture of chalk and water; creamy, delicious milk, as sweet
                  as it was nutritious. Some of us can remember having seen such milk in our
                  childhood.</p>
               <p>It was a goodly sight to see a large family of children gather hungrily around the
                  breakfast-table where the generous bowls of milk, with golden islands of pudding
                  emerging from the creamy depths, were ranged all around the edge, the contents
                  just cool enough to glide pleasantly down the throat, needing no mastication, and
                  laying the foundation for no malediction of the digestive organs. Nobody knew that
                  they had any such vexing apparatus inside. They believed, in a general way, that
                  the stomach had a duty to perform; but the idea that it might decline to act up to
                  its responsibilities never entered any body's head. All our unhappy knowledge of
                  the properties of gastric juice and pepsin was mercifully withheld from them.</p>
               <p>The simple meals, with their plain dressing, were sure of the appetizing sauce of
                  hunger. The morning pudding, or the heavier dinners, where the luscious
                  Johnny-cake, the green succotash, the boiled suet-pudding, or meal dumplings lined
                  with pulpy apples, were added to the indispensable meat and vegetables, sat
                  lightly on stomachs whose appetites were sharpened by healthful out-door labor or
                  stirring in-door exercise.</p>
               <p>We must not dismiss the hasty-pudding without a word in regard to its making up,
                  for this is one of the New England fine arts. Not one cook in a hundred prepares
                  it properly. It requires experience and skill, and a constant oversight. The
                  sifted meal must be ready to be stirred in when the water boils and has been
                  judiciously salted. With the left hand then strew in the golden shower, while with
                  haste you stir it into the boiling flood with the right. The real thing can't be
                  made by mixing the two in advance, though "mush" may be concocted in this manner.
                  Now, see how the fragrant compound swells, and thickens, and puffs, and wallops,
                  as if a general insurrection had broken out in the kettle; but the persistent
                  rounds of the ladle soon reduce it to order, the lumps disappear<pb n="194-195"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000097"/> appear from the surface, and the hasty-pudding—the
                  glory of Ceres—is revealed.</p>
               <p>Leaving these matters for the time in the able hands of Ruby, Mistress Bowen and
                  Hetty addressed themselves to the endless task of spinning, weaving, and
                  knitting.</p>
               <p>"We cannot accumulate too much cloth or too many stockings," said the mother. "Our
                  own men will need more than they did at home, and there are plenty of poor fellows
                  among the soldiers with no wives or mothers who can see to them. Hetty, we can do
                  a good deal for our country in this way."</p>
               <p>"The troops seem to be doing nothing except living out of doors. I suppose we
                  could do that if we should try."</p>
               <p>"There are good reasons for their inaction if we only knew them."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps. I should like to give them a push forward. It don't pay to just sit on
                  the heights around Boston and look at the town. That can be done after peace is
                  restored. The women could help. I wish they would let us fight."</p>
               <p>"Why, Hetty!"</p>
               <p>"I do. We would bring affairs to a head somehow. Why shouldn't we fight? We could
                  manage a gun as well as any of them, with a little practice. You know, mother
                  dear," continued this premature advocate of women's rights, "you know that I shot
                  that wild cat last spring when Mark's aim failed."</p>
               <p>"It would be a different matter to shoot men."</p>
               <p>"Yes. But it might come easy in time. The men have to get used to it."</p>
               <p>"Well, I am thankful that you will have no chance to try it," said her mother,
                  smiling, as she searched the bright face before her for a confirmation of its
                  sanguinary wishes. "It is not exactly the work for a woman."</p>
               <p>"That is as we view it, as Deacon Talbot says of the doctrines. It don't seem
                  proper work for men to shoot each other, but they glory in it. If our men could
                  manage to kill off two thirds of the Regulars in Boston how they would crow!"</p>
               <p>"Because it would be a step toward securing our rights. The English fight to keep
                  up the national greatness. If they have to give up the colonies they will lose a
                  big slice of their boasted empire."</p>
               <p>"They will only give up what does not belong to them. It is such nonsense for us
                  to be taxed to support folks in luxury the other side of the ocean. We ought to
                  have rebelled ages ago. No wonder they look upon us as a half-witted,
                  half-barbarous people."</p>
               <p>"They will find out their mistake," said Mistress Bowen quietly.</p>
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6508-00000098"/>
               <p>Hetty's cheeks were flushing painfully with the view of the subject that her
                  active imagination now presented, and so her mother turned her thoughts into a
                  pleasanter channel by referring to the contemplated visit of Fuss to the camp.</p>
               <p>"I shall be ready to send him to-morrow. It will be a day sooner than I had
                  intended, but it will enable him to return in time to have his dinner with his
                  family."</p>
               <p>"I am glad our Provincial Congress appointed this Thanksgiving. A queer thing for
                  them to do, though, considering all the circumstances."</p>
               <p>"They thought it best to keep up the old custom, especially as we have a new cause
                  for thankfulness in the increasing spirit of freedom among the people. That is
                  what Parson Smith said."</p>
               <p>"I ought to write to Mark. I promised him I would send a letter by every chance,
                  but I hate to write so much that I have kept putting it off."</p>
               <p>"If Fuss goes to-morrow you will not have time to write. Those stockings must be

               <p>"I am glad of it. I had rather knit all night than to write ten minutes. And,
                  besides, Fuss can tell them every thing."</p>
               <p>If Fuss carried no letter, he went charged with so many loving messages that it
                  was a wonder that he remembered half of them. Perhaps the eager questions of the
                  deacon and Mark aided him. He brought back a letter from Mark, which Hetty read
                  many times aloud to her mother, and so often by herself afterward that she soon
                  knew it by heart. It was worth all the attention she gave it.</p>
               <p>The brief note-writing that is now dignified with the name of correspondence had
                  not come into fashion. Mark's letter covered two large sheets of paper, and they
                  were closely written on all sides. He had been occupied with it at intervals for
                  three weeks, and only put in a few closing lines while Fuss was talking to the
                  deacon. A good part of it was taken up with the details of camp life, none of
                  which were uninteresting to the home-circle. After a minute description of the
                  camp and its surroundings, Mark wrote:—</p>

                              for soldiers, we can't be studying the more delicate mysteries of
                              housework. If we have to endure nothing worse before the difficulties
                              in the country are settled, we shall be fortunate indeed. Some think
                              that affairs will soon be adjusted to the satisfaction of all
                              concerned, but the general thinks differently. The British commit too
                              many outrages to permit us to hope for a speedy peace.</p>

                              destroy those that sympathized with the cause of liberty. Four ships,
                              under Captain Mowatt, went down to Falmouth,<ref rend="super"

                              accept the degrading terms offered them, and so the town was set on
                              fire and reduced to ashes. Four hundred dwelling-houses were burned,
                              and the barns and outhouses also, after being robbed of the year's
                              harvest.</p>

                              the people. They only serve to inflame the spirit of war. The Falmouth
                              men here are all burning with the desire to avenge the destruction of
                              their homes, and they find a host among the troops to sympathize with
                              them. In fact, we are all aching to do something.</p>
                           <p>"The ceaseless discipline of the troops since General Washington came
                              is irksome to our boys, who have never been used to obey, and we get
                              so tired of it, that if we were not ardently attached to the cause of
                              freedom we could not endure it. The everlasting drilling is necessary,
                              as the general takes pains to explain to us, yet no one could call it
                              inspiring. There is no room in it for deeds of noble daring, such as
                              we read of, and such as we should like to distinguish ourselves in
                              performing; it is the same tiresome routine day after day. There is no
                              glory in it—nothing to exhilarate the spirits; and being human, we
                              need human helps. 'In-human helps' you would call them. But before you
                              condemn our aspirations you must put yourself in our place, with
                              nothing to relieve the dullness of camp life.</p>

                              twenty thousand. He will keep as many of the present troops as
                              possible. How many that will be, unless a more enlivening service than
                              this blockade of Boston is proposed, no one can<pb n="200-201"

                              that they are inclined to back down from first principles, but their
                              fatigues and privations, which seem to have been endured so far for
                              nothing, have disheartened them. In many cases this depression of
                              spirits has undermined the health, and the strongest feeling is an
                              uncontrollable longing to revisit home.</p>
                           <p>"O Hetty dear! you do not know half the sweetness of that word,

                              night, and whenever I am off duty I think of little else. I fancy
                              myself with you, roving in the woods or rowing on the water. Dearer
                              dream still, I imagine myself in the circle around the bright evening
                              fire, listening to the voices that used to mingle so sweetly in the
                              sacred psalms. The memory of your voice, little sister, thrills me
                              more than the hearing of it used to do, and it had a wonderful power
                              over me at home. What would I not give to hear it swell out again in
                              the choir on Sunday!</p>
                           <p>"We have a sort of Sabbath service, though not at all like the solemn
                              prayers and sermons of Parson Smith. Our minister, or chaplain, as he
                              is called, comes into the camp on Sunday morning, and holds a meeting
                              so short that we hardly feel as if we had been to meeting at all. He
                              never preaches more than an hour, and his prayers are correspondingly
                              brief. He has little system either in preaching or praying. It is more
                              like an off-hand talk to us than like a sermon. It is very plain that
                              he is not hurt by over-much study.</p>
                           <p>"After the service he dines with the officers, and they say he is the
                              jolliest parson out, full of stories and witty jests. I may be a
                              little stiff in my notions, you always called me so, but I confess I
                              do not fancy a joking minister. To my thinking, he degrades his office
                              and brings contempt upon his sacred mission. The truths of the Bible
                              that he is called to present to us are solemn verities and not
                              witticisms, and if I were a preacher, I would rather lead one erring
                              sinner to the Saviour of sinners, than to be known as the author of
                              all the jokes that have been cracked since the foundation of the
                              world.</p>

                              difficult to procure his number, for he has decided to take none over
                              forty years old. You will be glad of that, because it will send Uncle

                              march into strange, distant places until I have seen you all again.
                              The chances of war are serious, and it is possible that I may not
                              return. That, however, will be as God wills. I am not anxious about

                           <p>"Joe Bagley came into the camp to see his brother last week. He is a
                              fine, brave boy, whose only grief is that he is too young to be a
                              soldier. He told me that since nearly all the young men in the choir
                              had enlisted, Joe Humphreys has tried to lead the singing. He said
                              that on the first Sunday after Joe assumed the office there was so
                              much giggling among the young girls that Parson Smith publicly
                              reproved them. It is lucky for Joe that the parson has no ear for
                              music. Joe Bagley says that it was the greatest noise he ever heard in
                              his life. He don't wonder the girls laughed. He told me, too, that if
                              it were not for Hetty Bowen's glorious voice the choir-singing would
                              have to be given up. It was good to hear that, for I feared that you
                              would not sing at all under such leadership. It is the worship of God
                              that is to be sustained, and that is of more consequence than Joe's
                              vanity. Don't you think so?</p>

                              league with the British. Of course that is all folly. The general
                              knows that we are not strong enough to venture an attack where failure
                              would be so disastrous to the whole country. We have some restless

                  can find so much to write. I began a letter to him a fortnight ago, and there is
                  nothing in it but 'Dear Mark.' He writes as easy as he talks."</p>

               <p>"Not strange at all," answered Mistress Bowen, regarding attentively the fair,
                  open face that had never yet hidden a secret from mother. "You were brought up
                  with him, and you had no brothers and sisters of your own. And, aside from that,
                  Mark is one of the best young men that I ever knew."</p>
               <p>"Mother," said Hetty, her eyes filling with tears, "it is ungrateful in me, and it
                  isn't natural, but I do miss Mark more than I do father. It seems wicked, but I
                  can't help it."</p>
               <p>"Your father has not been your playmate and constant companion, as Mark has.
                     Why,<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6508-00000103"/> when you were a wee baby, Mark
                  had the care of you as much as I did. And as you grew up he taught you to read and
                  write, which I am sure I never could have done. How he ever kept your mind on your
                  book is one of the mysteries. Then you have never had a pleasure separate from
                  him. Walking, riding, fishing, working, and singing, you have always been
                  together. It would be strange indeed if you did not feel lost without him."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, mother dear, I am glad you do not think it wrong. I have tried to feel
                  differently, but it always ends the same way, with a feeling that I somehow belong
                  to him."</p>
               <p>Perfectly satisfied with her mother's reasoning, Hetty folded the letter
                  carefully, and carried it up stairs to deposit it safely among her few
                  treasures—unfolding it again directly and reading it all through once more, it was
                  such a wonderful letter.</p>
               <p>Many years afterward, when the sweet eyes that lingered over the words so lovingly
                  were closed in their last slumber, a merry party of young folks, spending
                  Christmas at the old Bowen place, were "rummaging" in the wide garret. Far back
                  under the eaves was a dilapidated cherry-wood desk, full of little drawers and
                  cosy corners, and from one of these Mark's letter, time-worn and yellow, was
                  brought forth to the light, and the young explorers hushed their mirth while they
                  read it. It seemed to them like a voice from the grave.</p>
               <p>"Well," said a gay young miss, "that is a letter worth keeping so long.
                  Grandmother Hetty's musical talent has come down to our time; but her beauty,"
                  with a keen glance around the circle, "her beauty must have got lost on the
                  way."</p>
               <p>They put the old letter back reverently in its place, where it must have kept
                  well, or it never would have found an immortality in the pages of this story.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE SEAMSTRESS.</head>
               <p>"I HAVE been thinking, Hetty, about the soldiers all night. Your father writes
                  that many of them are far too thinly clothed for one of our winters. Suppose we
                  make up an entirely new outfit for our men, and let them give away what they have.
                  What do you think of the plan?"</p>
               <p>Hetty and Ruby were busily engaged in the somewhat unromantic work of dipping
                  candles—a tedious process that was then one of the most important of household
                  arts. Now, when gas or kerosene fill our rooms with a brilliant, steady light, and
                  the old-fashioned snuffers make no part of the necessary furniture of the kitchen
                  and parlor, we find it difficult to appreciate the homely skill that fashioned the
                  tallow candle, or the difficulty often found in lighting them. If the fire, so
                  carefully looked after, chanced to go out in cloudy weather when the fragrant
                  tinder in the box was damp, the grace of patience had a chance to grow beautifully
                  before the sharp striking together of the flint and steel produced a spark fiery
                  enough to catch. Failing ing at last, with hands smarting from the unwary hits
                  that had missed the steel, it was a common thing to go half a mile or more to a
                  neighbor's house to borrow a shovelful of burning coals to renew the
                  home-fire.</p>
               <p>But Mistress Bowen is waiting for an answer.</p>
               <p>"It is a capital plan, mother dear."</p>
               <p>"Do you think so? If we do any thing, we ought to do it at once. It is cold enough
                  this morning to nip any body's fingers. See! my hand sticks to the latch in this
                  room, with that great fire on the hearth."</p>
               <p>"Fuss says it is the coldest morning we have had. He had to cut the ice with an ax
                  to water the cattle."</p>
               <p>"Yes. We must have Miss Tempe to help. You had better go over and ask her
                  yourself; she will be more likely to come. She must bring her goose and big
                  shears. No matter about her press-board; we can furnish that. Wait till noon, for
                  the sun will have warmed up the air a little by that time, I think."</p>
               <p>Miss Temperance Lincoln, or Miss Tempe, as she was generally called, was a
                  tailoress by trade. She had no shop or stationary place of business, for most of
                  the necessary trades itinerated from house to house, finding both work and a
                  welcome by the warm firesides of the farmers. Aside from the help they afforded
                     the<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6508-00000105"/> weary housewife, they brought
                  with them a breezy atmosphere of cheerful gossip, that was not unwelcome during
                  the long winter evenings; for, in their continual changes from one family group to
                  another, they could not help finding out all matters of interest in each. It was
                  pleasant, indeed, to have the shoemaker and the tailoress together, and to hear
                  them compare notes, each with a fixed determination not to be outdone by the
                  other.</p>
               <p>The shoemaker usually had the best of it, for his habit of hammering on a lapstone
                  had made him expert in battering at secret matters, and the natural garrulity of
                  his sex made it difficult to retain the same; but when Miss Tempe was the
                  tailoress he had no chance at all. She had a way of telling a story and
                  pronouncing her opinions that threw all his conversational powers in the shade.
                  And being, what we should call, a strong-minded single lady, she had not so much
                  deference and consideration for the other sex as she ought to have had.</p>
               <p>On this occasion she had the field to herself, and was such an agreeable addition
                  to the family-circle that all were sorry when her work drew near its
                  completion.</p>
               <p>"We shall be so lonesome without you, Miss Tempe," said Hetty disconsolately.
                  "Don't hurry, please, you will finish to-day if you do."</p>
               <p>"Wal, I must finish to-day if I can. I'm engaged to old Squire White next, and he
                  is never willing to wait for wind nor tide. Men are apt to be unreasonable
                  critters."</p>
               <p>"Are they?" Hetty thought of one man, and felt sure that he would never be
                  unreasonable.</p>
               <p>"Yes. It's their natur'. There's Kiah, my brother, you know, he is almost
                  destitute of reason. No wonder, either, with such a shiftless wife. But then,"
                  said Miss Tempe, candidly, "he would discourage any woman on earth. And Jemima
                  wa'n't nothing in the first place."</p>
               <p>"So you don't like men folks, Miss Tempe?"</p>
               <p>"Wal, now," said Miss Temperance, spitting on her goose with great energy in order
                  to test its temperature, and straightening the seams of Mark's trousers on the
                  press-board, "wal, I've no objection to men in general. It is the men in
                  particular that are a nuisance. Taken as a whole, I rather like them; but to
                  settle down to one man, and humor and fuss over him when he is well, and nuss and
                  coddle him when he is sick, requires grace. Married women have more grace than
                  single ones. It is promised to folks according to their need, and
                     <emph>their</emph> need is tremendous."</p>
               <p>"And you never wanted to get married?"</p>
               <p>"Dunno. Can't exactly say that. If your father had asked me I should have said,
                     'Yes,<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6508-00000106"/> and thank you, too.' He knew
                  it as well as I did, and that is why he never asked me. Your father had common
                  sense."</p>
               <p>Hetty looked with pitiful eyes upon the straight, resolute woman whose one bit of
                  romance came to nothing. Miss Temperance seemed to read her thoughts, for she went
                  on cheerfully, "Don't go to filling up your young head with silly fancies about
                  me. I have enjoyed my life about as well as most people. Of course, I was
                  disappointed, for the deacon is one of a thousand; but I didn't go a-whining
                  round, a-making myself and every body else miserable. I just kept stidy to
                  work."</p>
               <p>"Did you know my mother then?"</p>
               <p>"No. The fust time I ever see her was in meetin'. And I <emph>did</emph> think he
                  would have done as well for himself if he had chosen me. She was a picture, there
                  was no one disputed that, but I said to myself that he needed something in a wife
                  besides beauty. You see I did not know her then."</p>
               <p>"I should think not," said Hetty warmly.</p>
               <p>"Wal, after a month or two, old Grandma Allen was took sick, and the night that
                  she died your mother and I watched together. I was clean beat. She was the
                  handiest person round the sick that I ever see. I began to alter my mind about
                  her. Then Mark's mother began to run down, and she kinder took to your mother and
                  wanted to have her in sight all the time. I stayed there as regular nuss, but, the
                  massy! there wasn't a day that your mother wasn't sent for. So I got acquainted
                  with her, and I told your father to thank the Lord, for he had got a treasure
                  right from the courts above."</p>
               <p>"I suppose he agreed with you?"</p>
               <p>"Of course he did. Your father aint a fool. I remember just how he looked when I
                  was a-praising her up. 'Tempe,' said he, 'I have wished many a time that you was
                  my sister.' 'Nothing to hender,' says I. And nothing ever has hendered all these
                  years, and your mother has been growing good and handsome all the time. She's just
                  the wife for him, and if that aint a compliment for her, I don't know how to make
                  one. Look at her now, out there by the back window. Isn't 'good wife' and 'good
                  mother' written all over her? What is she up to?"</p>
               <p>"She has something for Sylph. A bit of cake or sugar. See!"</p>
               <p>"The massy! Deu tell! I want to know!" ejaculated Miss Tempe, in amazement, as the
                  beautiful animal came cantering up to the stoop, and, arching her graceful neck,
                  ate the dainty from Mistress Bowen's hand. "Wal, I never<pb n="214-215"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000107"/> did! I wouldn't have that wild critter so near me
                  for all Weymouth."</p>
               <p>"There is no danger. She is as gentle as a sheep."</p>
               <p>"Not always. I can tell you that. I saw her the other day when she was fractious
                  enough. I thought she would have killed Joe Humphreys. I didn't blame her
                  much."</p>
               <p>"Joe Humphreys? How came he with Sylph? He had better not meddle with her," said
                  Hetty, her face flushing angrily.</p>
               <p>"There, you just hold still and I'll tell you. Perhaps you don't know that the
                  British have offered large sums for good horses. Why, Hetty! Your eyes are like
                  fire. Where on 'arth did you get your temper? Not from your mother, and the deacon
                  is—"</p>
               <p>"Never mind about my temper, now. Please, Miss Tempe, tell me what Joe was doing
                  with Sylph."</p>
               <p>"Sartain. Only you just cool down a little. It was—lemme see—yes, it was a week
                  ago last Thursday. I remember, because it was Kiah's birthday. Sixty years old.
                  Ten years older than Jemima. Wal, I was standing at the kitchen window a-washing
                  up the milk-pans, when I saw something away down the road that looked so curos
                  that I just ran out into the yard to see it clearer. It was only a cloud of dust,
                  but you see there wasn't a mite of air stirring, not enough to move my cap frill.
                  Howsomever, the cloud seemed to be in a great commotion, swaying about, first one
                  side of the road, and then the other, as if it couldn't make up its mind to any
                  thing. I had my doubts about it," said Miss Tempe, lowering her voice reverently;
                  "for Parson Smith had been preaching only the Sunday before about the prince of
                  the power of the air, and I says to myself, 'The old fellow is in that dust, sure
                  enough.' Not far from wrong then, was I, Hetty."</p>
               <p>"I don't know yet. Please go on."</p>
               <p>"I says to myself presently, 'It must be a whirlwind. Nothing else would keep just
                  in one place. And whirlwinds aint apt to.' Just then it began to come up the road
                  right toward our house. 'The massy! 'says I, 'I hope it aint a-coming here. I
                  never see any thing like it afore in all my born days. I wish Kiah was at home.
                  Strange that he will be a-kiting off just when he is needed.' Wal, on it came,
                  sometimes stopping to whirl, and then dashing ahead like all possessed. I had just
                  made up my mind that I was scared to death, when I see what it was that was
                  kicking up such a dust. It was Joe Humphreys mounted on your Sylph, as sure as you
                  live."</p>
               <p>"Miss Tempe!"</p>
               <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6508-00000108"/>
               <p>"True as Gospel. It was your pet horse, and Joe had both his arms around the
                  critter's neck, a-trying to hold on. He was determined to ride, and the horse was
                  determined he shouldn't. I wish you could have seen her a-kicking and rearing and
                  snorting, as she tried to throw him. At last, right opposite our house, she lay
                  down and rolled, and, rather than be crushed to death, Joe tumbled off. Sylph
                  sprang up as spry as a cat, and I was reely afraid she would kill him. But she
                  seemed to think he wasn't worth the trouble, for, after dancing round him, and
                  looking at him on all sides, she turned up her nose in contempt, and set off on a
                  gallop for home. It's wonderful how much such critters know."</p>
               <p>"What became of Joe?" Hetty was still too angry to laugh over his
                  discomfiture.</p>
               <p>"Wal, he seemed to be in a maze at first. He sat stock-still on the ground in the
                  middle of the road till the horse was out of sight. Then I spoke to him. 'The
                  massy on us!' says I. 'You've been up in a chariot of fire, as it were. You aint
                  hurt, be you?' 'No. 'He answered as short as pie-crust. 'Wal, there aint no sense
                  in being as cross as a bear. What ailed that horse?' 'She's possessed with a
                  devil. That's all.' 'You don't say so.' 'If I ever get my hands on her again,
                  she'll find out who is master,' says Joe as snappish as a biting turtle. 'I'll
                  lick her,' says he, 'till she can't see out of her eyes. I don't care if it kills
                  her.' There now, Hetty, I wont tell you another word, if you don't cool down. No
                  danger of his touching her again. Why, he's afraid of his life if she is on the
                  street. I saw him over to the post-office when you rode up after your paper, and
                  he turned as pale as a sheet. A <emph>yellow</emph> sheet, of course," said Miss
                  Tempe, laughing.</p>
               <p>"What did you say to him when he was threatening Sylph? I wish I had been
                  there."</p>
               <p>"I said that I couldn't see as he had any business to meddle with Hetty Bowen's
                  horse. 'O, you don't!' says he, sneering in his uppish way, till I had to fold my
                  hands to keep from boxing his ears. 'Wal, old lady, I s'pose there are a few other
                  things you don't see. Business or no business,' says he, 'I'm bound to teach that
                  beast a lesson, if I live.' 'O Joe!' says I, 'have you no bowels o' marcy?' 'Can't
                  say,' says he. 'Wal, young man, I advise you,' says I, 'to let that horse alone.
                  What on 'arth were you going to do with her?' 'Never you mind,' says he, 'I know
                  what I'm about.' <emph>'I</emph> can guess. But it wont be wholesome for you,'
                  says I, 'to try any of your games on Hetty while Fuss Bowen is around. I'm

                  up out of that dirt and be off.' Deary me! What a cowardly little scamp he is! He
                  started up and looked up the road, and, sure enough, there was Fuss a coming as
                  large as life. He didn't wait to say 'good-morning' to me, I can tell you. He
                  never had any manners to speak of, you know. He just crept through a gap in the
                  fence over the way, and then streaked it home across lots at a good jog for any
                  one so lazy. The massy! I've seen all sorts of mean folks—have to, working round
                  as I do—but that Joe Humphreys is the beater."</p>
               <p>Hetty was more disturbed by Miss Tempe's story than she would have owned, even to
                  herself. Unconsciously, she had hoped that Joe's spite was dying out, and the old
                  neighborly interest taking its place. Since Fuss had taken up his abode at the
                  farm there had been a manifest change in Joe's demeanor, and on several occasions
                  when he had been troubled to fit the tunes to the psalms in the church-choir he
                  had consulted her, and been guided by her judgment. It was quite impossible for
                  her to like or respect him, but it might be possible to have peace.</p>
               <p>If she could have seen the scar on his neck just under the showy cravat that he
                  wore on Sundays she would have been less sanguine. Every time Joe's eyes fell upon
                  this specimen of her handiwork he renewed his wrath and his vows of vengeance.</p>
               <p>"I'll reach her yet," he would say often when obliged to give up any of the plans
                  which were delicious to think of, but far from feasible when a trial of them was
                  proposed. "There will be some way sooner or later, and then, Miss Hett, we'll
                  see."</p>
               <p>Hetty had one of those sweet, cheery natures that, though easily excited to anger
                  under just provocation, could not retain the feeling any more than a lightning-rod
                  can imprison the electric current that it conducts to the ground. She could not
                  comprehend the brooding malice that was second nature to Joe. His attempt to
                  abduct Sylph roused her anew to a sense of his capacity for evil. As Miss Tempe
                  expressed it, "her temper was up." That he would renew his attempt at any
                  favorable opportunity she did not doubt, though she agreed with Miss Tempe in
                  thinking he would avoid another personal encounter with the half-wild animal. He
                  would get some other rascal to try that."</p>
               <p>In the evening when Fuss went out to the barn to attend to the chores, Hetty
                  followed him to make sure that Sylph was safe.</p>
               <p>"It's too cold out here for little missy," said Fuss, holding up his lantern so
                  that she could<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6508-00000110"/> see her favorite.
                  "Better come out in the daytime."</p>
               <p>"Is there no way to fasten the barn-doors, uncle?" she asked anxiously.</p>
               <p>"No. They don't need locking up, do they?"</p>
               <p>"Miss Tempe has been telling me, uncle, about the great sums that the British
                  offer for horses. And do you know, Joe has tried once to steal Sylph? Don't let my
                  mother know. Wait about milking till I tell you."</p>
               <p>Fuss opened his great eyes in astonishment as she repeated Miss Tempe's story.
                  That 'counts for it. I thought it was queer doings then. You see, missy, I had
                  taken Sylph down to drink, and when I came back I just hitched her to that post by
                  the gate, thinking may be she'd like to stand in the sun a little while I cleaned
                  up the stalls. Bimeby I came out, and the first thing I see was Sylph, tearing up
                  the road like a crazy critter. How she unhitched herself I couldn't make out."</p>
               <p>"She isn't safe a minute, uncle," Hetty half-crying as she reached over to pat the
                  animal's neck.</p>
               <p>"Now, don't you fret a bit. Trust Uncle Fuss to look out for breakers, now his
                  eyes are open. Jupe must sleep out here to-night, and to-morrow there will be some
                  bars and padlocks that will take too much time to break to make the bizness pay.
                  Cheer up, missy. There aint a Britisher alive that'll get a chance to try your
                  horse. Uncle Fuss'll see to that."</p>
               <p>"O uncle! it is such a comfort to have you here!" Hetty patted Fuss's coat-sleeve
                  very much as she had Sylph's glossy neck.</p>
               <p>"Yes, missy, I expect it is. You just come out here to-morrow night and see me
                  fasten up. You'll find your uncle has what they calls a genius in that line."</p>
               <p>"Uncle, wouldn't you think that Joe would get tired of plaguing us? It would be so
                  much pleasanter to do one a kindness if he only knew it."</p>
               <p>"Missy," said Fuss, oracularly, "I've allus noticed that you can't get any thing
                  out of a jug that aint in a jug."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">A SETTLED FEVER.</head>
               <p>AUNT HANNAH LOUD lived in a little two-roomed cottage all by herself. More than
                  half a century ago she had come, a happy wife with her young husband, to make a
                  home under the humble roof; content to share his lot, and accepting with
                  cheerfulness the prospect of steady toil that the future promised her. For what
                  was this drawback when set off with youth and health and love?</p>
               <p>A few brief months, so full of happiness as to be set apart from all the rest as
                  the golden period of her life, and then a heavy cloud settled over all the coming
                  years. Her husband was brought home from a "raising," where he had been assisting
                  a neighbor, with his skull fractured by the falling of a heavy piece of timber. It
                  had fallen through the carelessness of the owner, who, with the most of his
                  helpers, was too much under the influence of New England rum to calculate dangers
                  or to fear them.</p>
               <p>Young Harry Loud was not fatally injured—that is, he did not die at once of the
                  hurt, but his brain was hopelessly affected, and Aunt Hannah suffered the daily
                  torture of witnessing a living death, far more pitiable than if he had been
                  brought home a corpse. Only those whose affection has soothed a disordered
                  intellect, or sadly watched the feeble play of a broken-down mind, can appreciate
                  the calamity that had befallen the young wife.</p>
               <p>Aunt Hannah never complained. She took up her burden without a murmur, and bore it
                  with unfailing patience, toiling early and late to provide the comforts that he
                  needed, and never leaving him for an hour, not even to visit the house of God.
                  Only once was the saintly sweetness of her temper known to fail her, and that was
                  when her brothers, who were both wealthy farmers, proposed that she should throw
                  her burden upon the town. Neither of them had offered the slightest help or a word
                  of sympathy during her hours of sorrow, and Aunt Hannah did not pretend to listen
                  with any degree of patience to their advice.</p>
               <p>"It will make no difference to him," said the oldest one; "or, if it does, he
                  can't reason about it, and you could make yourself comfortable if you were rid of
                  him. My wife would be glad to have you make your home with us, just as you did
                  before you was married."</p>
               <p>"And spin all day, and half the night, just for my victuals, as I did then. I
                  don't doubt<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6508-00000112"/> she would. And you too,
                  John, for that matter."</p>
               <p>"You might live with us," suggested the other. "I guess Debby wouldn't be likely
                  to overwork you."</p>
               <p>"No, Robert. But she would leave every thing at loose ends just as she does now,
                  and it would all come upon me finally. Not that I mention these things as a reason
                  for not listening to you. If you could offer me a palace and servants to wait on
                  me, I would not leave Harry. He needs me now more than he did when I promised to
                  love and cherish him till death. And I need him. Bewildered as his poor brain is,
                  he knows me and loves me. Every day I thank God on my knees for that."</p>
               <p>"Well, you can't say we haven't offered you a home."</p>
               <p>"You have offered me a chance to work, but a home is a different matter. It means
                  more than just a roof over one's head. I have a home here in this little hut, and
                  I mean to keep it."</p>
               <p>For a half a score of years Aunt Hannah toiled on, watching over her unfortunate
                  charge unceasingly, and then he died. No sincerer mourner ever followed a dear one
                  to the last resting-place than she to whom had come, as indifferent spectators
                  phrased it, so merciful a release. The little cottage seemed very empty and
                  desolate when she returned to it. For whom now should she labor? Or whom pour out
                  the warm love that is a part of the true woman's nature?</p>
               <p>Again the brothers came with their offers, and again they were declined. The
                  associations of her home were too sacred to be given up. Not a corner of the two
                  rooms but had been hallowed by <emph>his</emph> presence. Every thing in them was
                  dear for his sake. Here was home indeed for her. She remembered the days of her
                  youth when, though sorely home-sick, she had no house to fly to.</p>
               <p>"No," she answered to all remonstrances. "I have a home here, thank God! And if I
                  was able to support Harry and myself, I can surely provide for myself alone."</p>
               <p>They left her to herself, never troubling themselves to inquire after her welfare
                  again. The years passed by, and the brothers died, so rich in this world's goods
                  that their children were accounted wealthy; but the penurious spirit of the
                  fathers had descended with the property, and not one of a score of nephews and
                  nieces ever troubled themselves to inquire about Aunt Hannah. She earned her
                  living by spinning for the farmers in the neighborhood, who all respected her.</p>
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6508-00000113"/>
               <p>These were always ready to befriend her. They sent her generous presents of meat
                  whenever they killed any for their own tables, and in the fall they filled her
                  cellar with the best of vegetables. In return, she was ready to watch with the
                  sick, or to render any act of kindness in her power.</p>
               <p>Every body liked her. There was a charm in her homely, cordial manner, and in the
                  mild expression of the blue eyes, still as bright as in youth. The shining silver
                  hair made a lovely setting for the placid brow, and there was always a pleasant
                  smile hovering about the mouth. She was especially noted for one trait that was as
                  rare then as now—an abundant Christian charity that threw its mantle over the
                  failings and short-comings of her fellow-creatures.</p>
               <p>If there was one place where Aunt Hannah was prized more than in any other it was
                  at the Bowen farm. Here she was always a welcome guest, and Hetty had grown up
                  with a love and reverence for her only second to the affection she felt for her
                  mother. "I always feel, when I am here, that I have two homes," the lonely old
                  lady would say.</p>
               <p>"It would be nice if you had only this one," Hetty would reply, affectionately,
                  "for then we could keep you always."</p>
               <p>It was in December, about two months after the deacon left home, that Aunt Hannah
                  took a severe cold, which, as she expressed it, "settled all over her." For nearly
                  a week she nursed herself as well as she was able, dosing herself with the simple
                  herb teas that were in common use for colds, and growing worse instead of better
                  all the time.</p>
               <p>She had no one to advise her, for there were no neighbors in sight of her cottage,
                  and it was seldom that any one passed by on the back-road where she lived. A more
                  secluded spot could not well be imagined, or a more lonesome one than it became to
                  poor Aunt Hannah when on the evening of the fifth day an old-fashioned snow-storm
                  began to fall.</p>
               <p>She had been growing worse rapidly all day. She remembered how often Mistress
                  Bowen had told her that it was not safe for so old a person to live there alone,
                  and for the first time realized the kindly wisdom of the caution.</p>
               <p>A sudden fear came over her. Not of dying alone, for the fear of death was a
                  feeling impossible with her believing rest upon the promises of God to his
                  children; but she shrank from the helplessness of sickness, with no loving hand
                  near to smooth her pillow or minister to her needs.</p>
               <p>As she sat by the window looking out upon the dreary prospect, and holding her
                     aching<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6508-00000114"/> head with both hands, a
                  sudden resolve inspired her.</p>
               <p>"I will go straight over to the deacon's," said poor Aunt Hannah. "If I live to
                  get there, they will see to me."</p>
               <p>Stopping only to make her fire secure, and to lock her door, she started out to
                  walk a mile through the snow. There were nearer neighbors, but she did not once
                  think of them. She never knew how she got over the long road, or how she managed
                  to find her way in the dark. Steadying herself by holding to the fences, when her
                  head was too dizzy to go on, she made her way slowly and painfully toward her
                  haven of rest. She just remembered afterward how pleasantly the light shone
                  through the kitchen windows as she approached the house. All the preceding fatigue
                  was forgotten.</p>
               <p>Hetty and her mother had been sitting all the evening with Ruby by the kitchen
                  fire, all three knitting busily. Fuss had gone over to his own cabin just before
                  dark, to make sure, as he said, that "that shiftless Jake had things shut up
                  before the storm drifted in," and he had not yet returned.</p>
               <p>They had been working silently, for the thoughts of each were far away with the
                  soldiers who were exposed to the rigor of the wintry storms, in addition to the
                  other privations of camp-life. The prospect of a settlement of the national
                  troubles grew less and less probable as the days wore on, and the discontent of
                  the people increased.</p>
               <p>Mistress Bowen was patriotic; her eyes flashed and her cheek glowed at the thought
                  of yielding to those "domineering English;" but she was a woman and a wife, and
                  to-night had forgotten all other considerations in speculating upon the deacon's
                  "getting the rheumatiz hitched to him for the winter."</p>
               <p>The achievement of American independence was of small moment compared with this
                  possibility.</p>
               <p>"It'll just break down his constitution, Hetty, if he doesn't get killed."</p>
               <p>The young girl started from her own dream at the sound of her mother's voice.</p>
               <p>"Yes. What did you say?"</p>
               <p>"He never will be able to stand such weather as this."</p>
               <p>"O! yes, he will, mother dear. He is young and strong."</p>
               <p>"Not young, Hetty. He is seven years older than I am. You don't call me young, do
                  you?"</p>
               <p>Hetty colored rosily.</p>
               <p>"I was thinking of Mark, mother."</p>
               <p>"There's somebody in the back-room," said<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6508-00000115"
                  /> Ruby, getting up quickly. "And it aint Fuss."</p>
               <p>She threw open the door as she spoke, and the light from the kitchen fell upon the
                  figure of a woman, who was half sitting, half lying upon the long settle in the
                  porch. They all recognized her.</p>
               <p>"Why, Aunt Hannah!" It was Mistress Bowen who spoke. "What on earth sent you out
                  in this storm at this time of night?"</p>
               <p>"I am going to be sick. I came over here to be taken care of."</p>
               <p>"You poor soul!" exclaimed Mistress Bowen, compassionately regarding the trembling
                  form and flushed face of her old friend. "Come right in here by the fire. I'm
                  afraid you've just killed yourself coming out. How long have you been sick?"</p>
               <p>Aunt Hannah did not answer. She rose and tried to walk, but staggered back to her
                  seat again, holding out her arms helplessly.</p>
               <p>"There, there; don't try to stir alone. You are sick, sure enough. Lean on me, and
                  let Ruby take hold on that side. Hetty, you just pull out that chair. Not that
                  one, child." Hetty had nervously seized upon a low rocker. "I mean the deep one
                  that grandpa liked. Now, don't you worry one mite," to Aunt Hannah. "We'll see to
                  you. You are all worn out, walking ing so far when you were sick; but you'll get
                  rested, and we will nurse you well in a jiffy. Why, you begin to look better
                  already," added Mistress Bowen encouragingly as Aunt Hannah sank back in the big
                  easy-chair with a sigh of relief.</p>
               <p>"I hadn't any body else to go to," said the old lady, looking up appealingly.</p>
               <p>"Dear Aunt Hannah! you couldn't have found a place where you'd be more welcome.
                  I'm real glad you are here."</p>
               <p>"I guess I'd better go to bed pretty soon," said the old lady feebly. "I'm tired
                  out."</p>
               <p>"So you are, but you must not go into a cold room to sleep. Lean back in your
                  chair, and Hetty will get you some hot drink, while Ruby and I get your bed
                  ready."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Ruby, as soon as they were out of the kitchen, "you'll want a fire in
                  the spare room now, I s'pose."</p>
               <p>"In the spare room! Why, no. The little room that opens off the front entry will
                  be better."</p>
               <p>"Not for her," answered Ruby decidedly. "It aint airy enough, and it is too near
                  the sounds in the kitchen. 'Less old Ruby is very much mistaken, that Aunt Hanner
                  is a-going to be powerful sick."</p>
               <p>"O, no! I hope not."</p>
               <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6508-00000116"/>
               <p>"There's no use at all in hoping about it. The facts are there. You can't get away
                  from them nohow."</p>
               <p>"Well, I am sure I am willing to use that room if she needs it. It wont hurt it
                  any way. But I can't help thinking she will be better in the morning."</p>
               <p>Ruby shook her head positively. She said no more, not thinking it respectful to
                  assert her opinions in opposition to Mistress Bowen, but she was far from giving
                  them up.</p>
               <p>"No, indeed," she said to herself as she proceeded to light a fire in the spare
                  room. "I've had 'sperience in these things, and I know."</p>
               <p>The spare rooms, as they were called in the farm-houses, never had a cheerful look
                  unless in times of sickness. Nothing else could soften their grim aspect, or break
                  up their prim order. The imposing array of bottles, that for safety were deposited
                  on the high mantle-shelf, could not help crowding the gaunt candlesticks that
                  stood like sentinels at each end, and disarranging the painted crockery images
                  that held their court in the center. The various sizes and shapes of the bottles
                  made it out of the question to follow any system in placing them. Then, the high
                  bed lost its precise roundness; the pillows, in ministering to the ease of the
                  sufferer ferer, recklessly disregarded the points of the compass, and the whole
                  room took on a tumbled, demoralized look that was inexpressibly refreshing.</p>
               <p>The spare room at the deacon's bore a strong family likeness to all the other
                  spare rooms in the region. It contained a bed, of course, and a highly-polished
                  chest of drawers, and half a dozen straight-backed, flag-bottomed chairs, which
                  were set in the usual places, squarely against the wall.</p>
               <p>While Ruby is building the fire there will be time enough to get a little used to
                  it. It was the largest room in the house. Its walls were of paneled wood,
                  curiously carved into various ingenious patterns, after the manner of the
                  homesteads left in the old country. There was room on them and in the deep
                  recessed windows for charming displays of rustic ornamentation, and in our time
                  all the available space would have been filled; but the artistic designs that now
                  make the humblest parlors attractive were among "the good things to be."</p>
               <p>Hetty never saw a hanging window-basket with delicate trailing vines, or dreamed
                  that one could be fashioned out of the gay birch-bark that abounded in the forest
                  close by. She never thought of carrying home and preserving the many-hued mosses
                  whose brilliant scarlet and<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6508-00000117"/> amber
                  contrasted so prettily with the soberer brown and green. She would stop in her
                  walks to admire the rose-fungi, with its pansy-like leaves, and the mitchella, so
                  sensitive to the touch, but she left them in their quiet haunts undisturbed. The
                  jaunty tiarrellas gleamed out by the brown rocks like frosted silver, but she
                  never thought of transferring any of these children of the woods to the bare walls
                  at home. If she had found in her chamber that rare, ornamental gray sphere, a
                  hornet's nest, it would have been summarily turned out of doors without a thought
                  of its decorative properties.</p>
               <p>Ground pines were sometimes twinkling with holly about the tall clock and
                  looking-glass at Christmas-time, but as soon as they dried they were ignominiously
                  swept out as rubbish.</p>
               <p>The fair maidens who linger for hours over a bit of silver lichen or cup-moss, who
                  make pictures of autumn leaves and frame them daintily with fir cones, will hardly
                  understand how Hetty could have missed the delight of fashioning the rich
                  materials about her into "things of beauty," yet it is probable that the practical
                  people of the time would have considered her crazy if she had attempted it. The
                  incessant spinning and weaving served our foremothers in the place of fancy work.
                  The beautiful was kept subordinate to the useful, and no one thought it possible
                  to blend the two elements.</p>
               <p>The room prepared for Aunt Hannah lacked no real comfort. The fire blazed up
                  cheerfully, and a fire is always homelike. The old lady brightened up perceptibly
                  when she saw it, and for a short time she talked quite naturally.</p>
               <p>"Law sakes, Miriam," she said to her kind hostess, "one would think I was a great
                  lady. Any other room would have done for me."</p>
               <p>"We haven't any room too good for you. If you can only sleep well to-night so as
                  to get rested, we shall have you up as bright as a dollar to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"I can't help sleeping here. It seems so good to be where there is some one to
                  look after me. Folks may have all the riches in the world, but a friend in need is
                  worth more than all. You will have your reward, Miriam. I may not pay you, but God
                  keeps an account up yonder."</p>
               <p>The bed had been thoroughly warmed and aired, and the flickering blaze of the fire
                  shone among the folds of the curtains, lighting them up invitingly.</p>
               <p>"I don't see how I can help resting here," said Aunt Hannah, as she lay down on
                  the soft pillow. "It seems like a chamber of peace."</p>
               <p>But Ruby was right. A serious illness was<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6508-00000118"
                  /> upon her, and all night long she tossed and moaned with fever and pain. Before
                  morning she was delirious.</p>
               <p>As soon as it was light Mistress Bowen sent Fuss after old Dr. Parris. He had been
                  the family physician of the Bowens for forty years—so long that they would
                  scarcely have thought it possible to be legitimately sick without his aid. Indeed,
                  he held a place, in the estimation of the Weymouth people, second to no created
                  being.</p>
               <p>Even Parson Smith hung on a lower peg in the scale of society; for while that
                  learned minister discussed the doctrines of grace so profoundly as to hopelessly
                  enshroud them in a fog of mystery, the doctor was supposed, in a certain sense, to
                  hold the issues of life and death in his hands. Every word that fell from his lips
                  impressed the hearers with a weird sense of power, and no one who had been favored
                  once with an experience of his pills and "medicated drops," ever spoke of him
                  afterward without the deepest reverence.</p>
               <p>When his wide, yellow-bottomed "shay" was seen on the road, the men stopped their
                  work to pay him homage. The little boys pulled off their hats and bobbed their
                  curly pates frantically; the little girls made such deep obeisances that a row of
                  involuntary "cheeses" lined the way.</p>
               <p>He drove a white horse, which, from long years of observation, had become so
                  imbued with a proper respect for his master that no amount of spurring could
                  increase his pace beyond an exceedingly moderate trot. No matter if half the
                  babies in town were strangling with buttons or pins in their throats, or trying to
                  sneeze little stones or beans out of their noses, that horse maintained both his
                  own and his master's dignity. Nothing could make him hurry or disturb his
                  composure.</p>
               <p>Neither could any one hurry the doctor. "There is nothing gained by haste," was
                  his favorite maxim. So, man and beast being agreed on this point, it was nearly
                  noon when Hetty, who had been anxiously watching the road for three hours,
                  announced that the doctor's "shay" was in sight.</p>
               <p>"I wish I had a rope hitched on to him," said the young girl, impatiently, "I'd
                  give it <emph>one</emph> good twitch. I should think his wife would die of
                  disgust. I know I couldn't live with such a slow concern. He's a regular
                  snail."</p>
               <p>By this time the horse had come to a stop at the gate, and the doctor, leisurely
                  descending from his carriage, proceeded to hitch the horse securely—a most
                  unnecessary operation, because nothing could be further from the animal's
                  intentions than a wish to stir from the spot until<pb n="238-239"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000119"/> actually obliged to do so. A short examination of
                  the two wheels and of one of the horse's shoes followed, and then the doctor
                  solemnly walked up to the front door, where Mistress Bowen waited to receive him,
                  and give him such preliminary information as she could before ushering him into
                  the sick-room.</p>
               <p>"Ah! yes, yes," said he after listening to all she had to say. "Just so. Of
                  course."</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid she is very sick, doctor."</p>
               <p>"We will find out about that directly. Let me see her."</p>
               <p>The old doctor was a model of courtesy, and scrupulously polite under all
                  circumstances. If he had been going to be hung he would have "made his manners" to
                  his executioner. So, though he had been told that Aunt Hannah was "out of her
                  head," he bowed profoundly as he approached her.</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Mrs. Loud? Ah! hum, yes, I see. Sorry to find you sick."</p>
               <p>She roused herself and lifted her heavy eyes to his face, but there was no
                  recognition in them.</p>
               <p>"It is the doctor, Aunt Hannah."</p>
               <p>"Don't disturb her, madam. Pressure of blood on the brain. Bring me a bowl, if you
                  please."</p>
               <p>"What is the matter with her?"</p>
               <p>"A settled fever, madam. Must have been about her for some time."</p>
               <p>In those days a settled fever meant business. In the lightest cases, the patient
                  did not presume to keep about the house, and be dressed daily as many do now.
                  Indeed, after the doctor's first vigorous tussle with the disease, there was no
                  inclination to stir any more.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">RESTING FROM LABOR.</head>
               <p>DR. PARRIS sat down by the bedside, put on his big, round-bowed spectacles, and
                  took out his watch to time the sick woman's pulse. A breathless silence reigned in
                  the room. Hetty had slipped in behind her mother, and perched herself nervously on
                  one of the window-seats, and Ruby stood in the doorway with open mouth and dilated
                  eyes. So motionless were they all, that the ticking of the watch could be counted
                  anywhere in the room. Anxiety to hear the doctor's opinion, and a dread of what
                  that opinion might be, filled their hearts.</p>
               <p>The heretical notion that a doctor might be mistaken in his judgment found no
                  place in their thoughts. Their faith in him was something sublime. There was no
                  element of doubt in it. "The doctor says so," settled every thing.</p>
               <p>"I shall want some bandages," he said at last, shutting up his watch and holding
                  it to his ear before replacing it in his pocket, "and perhaps this young woman,"
                  turning with a smile to Hetty, "had better go out while I bleed Mrs. Loud, unless
                  she is too courageous to be afraid of blood. Perhaps she will hold the bowl for
                  me."</p>
               <p>"No, indeed!" exclaimed Hetty, springing up and darting out of the room in a
                  fright. Ruby followed as fast as she could.</p>
               <p>"Now, madam," said the doctor, with a quiet chuckle, "I have cleared the room, and
                  we will see what can be done. It is fortunate that I can depend on you."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Mistress Bowen, trembling a little. Although she had assisted Dr.
                  Parris several times when he had been called to see her neighbors, she never
                  became so used to the process as to look on without concern.</p>
               <p>Aunt Hannah made no resistance beyond a faint moan when the incision was made in
                  her arm, and he proceeded to take away as much as he dared of the precious
                  life-fluid that the poor sufferer needed so much.</p>
               <p>"There, madam. We have left as little as we could for the fever to feed upon, and
                  she feels better for it."</p>
               <p>It was true that the process had relieved her head, for Aunt Hannah opened her
                  eyes and spoke rationally.</p>
               <p>"Is it you, Dr. Parris?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I think it is. You are sick, and I have come to see you."</p>
               <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6508-00000121"/>
               <p>"What is it? Fever?"</p>
               <p>"Well, we shall have to call it that."</p>
               <p>Aunt Hannah feebly raised herself so as to get a view of the doctor and of the
                  thick saddle-bags open on the table, and then she shut her eyes and lay back with
                  a deep groan. She had nursed sick people enough to take in all the possibilities
                  of her own case.</p>
               <p>"Mistress Bowen, I will now give you the directions for treatment. Let her rest a
                  couple of hours, and then give her this powder. It is an emetic. It will probably
                  exhaust itself in an hour—in two hours at most. Then you will give this senna.
                  Steep it in a pint of water, and sweeten it or not, just as she prefers it. If the
                  delirium returns, you may apply this plaster to the back of her neck."</p>
               <p>"What is it?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing but Spanish flies for a blister," answered the doctor indifferently. "I
                  had rather not try it just yet, but you can judge if she needs it. Soak her feet
                  in hot mustard water, and—have you any horse-radish leaves?"</p>
               <p>"Plenty of them in the garret."</p>
               <p>"Yes. Just so. Wrap her feet in them. If they draw too much, substitute burdocks.
                  Some jugs of hot water about her in the bed would be a good thing after the senna;
                  it would promote perspiration. A little warm toast-water if she is thirsty, but no
                  cold water on any account. There is nothing else to do today. I will be in
                  tomorrow as early as I can."</p>
               <p>The old doctor bowed himself out of the room, smiling as benevolently as if he had
                  brought a roasted turkey to a starving family.</p>
               <p>"Miriam," said Aunt Hannah feebly, "do you think it would be wicked to let all
                  these messes alone, and so die in peace?"</p>
               <p>Mistress Bowen leaned over the bedside and kissed the old lady's thin cheek.
                  Pitying tears filled her eyes. "We must do what the doctor says, Aunt Hannah, and
                  trust to God to bless the means we use. I wish I could bear it for you. I would do
                  it gladly if I could."</p>
               <p>"I feel too weak to take the emetic. Couldn't we burn it and the doctor not know
                  it?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed. He would be sure to ask about it. And it is just what you need, or he
                  wouldn't have ordered it."</p>
               <p>"O dear, suz!" These were Aunt Hannah's last words of remonstrance. She submitted
                  to the treatment with the spirit of a martyr, and ever afterward swallowed any
                  dose offered her without question or comment.</p>
               <p>So far she had but taken the initiatory steps. There was a regular system for
                  treating fevers, just as there was for manufacturing cheeses. One step followed
                  another like the letters in the<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6508-00000122"/>
                  alphabet. No matter what the temperament or constitution of the patient might be,
                  a fever was a fever, and it was the disease that was to be treated, not the
                  sufferer. Once oust the disease and the patient was all right at once.</p>
               <p>Exasperated by its hard usage, the fever was generally an obstinate affair. But
                  the resources of its opponent were wonderful. There were castor-oil or rhubarb for
                  each alternate day, there were fever-drops and sleeping-powders, there were the
                  powders to keep up a ceaseless nausea, and sweating-drops and cooling-drops, and
                  the calomel, whose special mission it was to give admonitory touches to the liver.
                  No one could keep the course of the medicines in memory. It had to be carefully
                  written down from the doctor's lips to avoid mistakes.</p>
               <p>It was contrary to the rules to alleviate the burning thirst of the afflicted one
                  with a drop of cold water, or to temper the close atmosphere of the room with a
                  breath of fresh air. If the fever-taint had been a precious treasure, it could not
                  have been guarded more carefully. The wide-mouthed fireplace allowed, or rather
                     <emph>forced,</emph> a partial ventilation, but not enough to render it
                  improbable that whoever came out of the fresh winter air to watch with the
                  patient, would bear away the seeds of the disease. Fevers generally had the run of
                  the neighborhood.</p>
               <p>Aunt Hannah lay day after day insensible to all but the terrible suffering. Her
                  poor lips were cracked and blackened like cinders, and in many places her skin was
                  worn through, so that every movement was a separate torture. In this state she
                  held on to life with little perceptible alteration for many weeks, until all
                  desire for recovery left her.</p>
               <p>The people who were doctored for a fever were always willing to die. They
                  invariably showed a most edifying resignation to their fate. No matter how
                  irreligious they had been in health, or how they had dreaded their doom as
                  possible reprobates, they lost all fear of the future under the sufferings of the
                  present treatment. Any change was grasped at as a possible relief. The general
                  sentiment accorded with David's appeal to the prophet Gad: "Let us fall now into
                  the hand of the Lord, for his mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand
                  of man."</p>
               <p>Aunt Hannah did not die of the fever; that is, she lived several weeks after the
                  disease was routed from her system. Lived to lose all her hair, to have her teeth
                  loosen and rattle out, and to feel as if she was falling to pieces all over.</p>
               <p>She declined very gradually, suffering little<pb n="246-247"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000123"/> from pain, but steadily growing weaker. She never
                  went back to her little cottage. To please her, the furniture was moved from it to
                  her sick-room, and every thing about her made as natural and homelike as
                  possible.</p>
               <p>"I have but a few things," she said; "nothing of value but my old china, and half
                  a dozen silver spoons, but I want it by me. After I am gone it will be Hetty's. I
                  want her to have all that <emph>I</emph> have. It wont half pay for all I've had
                  done for me here. That is something that can't be paid for. Money wont buy love.
                  But the little that I have must be hers."</p>
               <p>The common superstition that making a will is sure to shorten a person's life, had
                  its effect on Aunt Hannah. "I could make one if it was necessary, Hetty," she
                  would say, "but 'tain't likely any body will be mean enough to trouble you about
                  it. My relations would be ashamed to, after never coming nigh me all these years.
                  If they do, you just tell them that it is yours. I guess I've got a right to give
                  it to any body I choose."</p>
               <p>"Don't worry, Aunt Hannah; I hope you will live to spend all you have on
                  yourself!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I sha'n't, and I don't know as I want to. But if any of my folks should get
                  hold of my house and things, I should want to appear to them from the grave. Why,
                  Hetty! It would be the same as stealing in the sight of God," said the old lady,
                  in pious horror.</p>
               <p>"I dare say they will do what is right," said Mistress Bowen, soothingly. "I
                  wouldn't think any more about it. Every thing comes round about right if we just
                  leave it to itself." Not a very scriptural doctrine that, but the kind woman only
                  meant a caution against borrowing trouble. At night, when the old lady was asleep,
                  the subject was just mentioned again, and Hetty was advised to avoid exciting any
                  doubts in the invalid's mind in regard to the final execution of her wishes.</p>
               <p>"Let her talk all she wants to. It does no harm to humor her. She is a good old
                  soul, if there ever was one, and whether her means hold out or not, she shall
                  never want a home while we can give her one."</p>
               <p>Very little concern did Hetty's promised inheritance give any of the family. Other
                  and more serious matters engrossed their attention, for, as the winter wore on, it
                  was well known that there was much suffering in the army around Boston.</p>
               <p>Early in February Aunt Hannah died. Alas for her confidence in human nature!
                  Scarcely was she buried, before this apparently lonely old woman was found to have
                  a large circle of relatives. Nephews and nieces sprung up on<pb n="248-249"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000124"/> every hand like mushrooms. And the cause of their
                  sudden resurrection was the little property that she had left.</p>
               <p>Very respectable people they were, wealthy and moral; some of them of much
                  consideration in the Church, and in town affairs. All of them knew that she had
                  given what she had to Hetty, in order to show her gratitude for the steady
                  kindness of the deacon's family. But they knew, too, that there was no will, and
                  that Hetty could not legally hold it.</p>
               <p>It must be confessed that this eager gathering of the rich relatives, like a flock
                  of cormorants, about so small a pittance, to which in the sight of heaven they had
                  no right, was calculated to awaken the contempt of the whole community. It did
                  have this effect, but the good or bad opinion of their neighbors was of little
                  moment to the greedy heirs.</p>
               <p>They met with no opposition in securing the property. When they came to the farm
                  to collect what she had brought there, preparatory to selling her effects at
                  public auction, Mistress Bowen simply stated the wishes of the dear old lady, and
                  then left the affair in their hands.</p>
               <p>"If she had made a will, ma'am, your daughter could have held it without
                  doubt."</p>
               <p>It was the husband of the oldest niece who delivered this sage opinion.</p>
               <p>"And are not her wishes to be regarded at all? You all know what they were."</p>
               <p>"Well, ma'am, the matter lies just here. The minute Aunt Hannah died her property
                  belonged to her heirs. Just the same as if they had always owned it. Now the
                  question is: Does any one of these lawful heirs choose to give his or her property
                  to your daughter?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Loud, I shall make no effort to get this property for Hetty, or to retain the
                  gifts that she gave us while alive. If I brought only moderate charges against the
                  estate for what we have done for her, it will cover all she left. You know this
                  very well. But don't be alarmed. What I did for the poor, friendless old lady, who
                  was deserted by her own kin, I did freely, without hope of reward. I shall never
                  take money for any kindness that has been rendered by me. The law of equity would
                  give us all she had. The law of human invention gives it to you. When we both come
                  before our Maker to be judged by the higher law, may the Lord be judge between you
                  and me!"</p>
               <p>So the property of Aunt Hannah was disposed of. Divided and subdivided among the
                  numerous claimants, it gave but a small pittance to each; but it was money, and
                  they eagerly grasped it, not sparing enough to buy Aunt Hannah a grave-stone.</p>
               <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6508-00000125"/>
               <p>After the war was over, the deacon set up a suitable one with this appropriate
                  inscription: "She hath done what she could." It was on the south slope of Burying
                  Hill, near the graves of her parents, and next to that of her husband. Let us hope
                  that modern vandalism, in its fancied improvements, has not displaced it.</p>
               <p>Neither neglect or reverence has affected the silent sleeper. She had, indeed,
                  entered into rest. Her whole life had been a preparation for the eternal life.
                  Long after her death, her memory remained fresh, and mothers, recounting her
                  virtues to their children, would finish the history by saying: "If ever a saint
                  lived upon the earth, Aunt Hannah Loud was one." Doubting hearts, puzzled by
                  inconsistent professors of piety, was kept from utter skepticism by a remembrance
                  of her conscientious life and sweet Christian spirit. Rich Aunt Hannah! She rests
                  from her labors, and her works do follow her.</p>
               <p>Those, too, who so greedily snapped up her little property have long since mingled
                  with the dust. They have gone to reap the just reward of their doings. We will not
                  be too curious in regard to its nature. They are in God's hands, and he, being
                  infinite in wisdom, knows what to do with them.</p>
               <p>It is a pity that their descendants are so numerous. We look with pitying leniency
                  upon the man who falls into sin under fierce and sudden temptations. Our very
                  souls long to do something to restore him to his lost estate. But no effort of
                  nature or grace quite overcomes the contemptuous disgust with which a true,
                  upright person shrinks from contact with the miserly meanness that exalts
                  perishing pelf above honor and right.</p>
               <p>Esau was hungry, not stingy, when he sold his birthright for a mess of pottage.
                  Many a sermon has been preached upon his folly, which was wisdom itself when
                  compared with the terrible mistake of selling an eternal inheritance for a few
                  coppers.</p>
               <p>In this connection, shall I reveal something that Hetty used to tell with great
                  glee in after years? When Aunt Hannah's furniture was collected, before the
                  auction, the silver spoons and old china were missing. No one could tell what had
                  become of them. The heirs doubted Mistress Bowen's declaration of ignorance, and
                  threatened Miss Hetty with justice if she did not produce them. That was
                  impossible, because she had no knowledge of their hiding-place.</p>
               <p>They never came to the light until her wedding-day, when Fuss brought them in a
                     basket<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6508-00000126"/> and presented them gravely as
                  his own gift to the bride.</p>
               <p>"Ruby told me how Aunt Hannah wanted you to have these, so while they was
                  a-searching for her clothes and things in the spare room, I just takes these
                  little notions over to the cabin. Knew you'd want them when the time came."</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.</head>
               <p>RIGHT into the middle of February came one of those balmy spells of moderate
                  weather that sometimes come as a surprise in winter. It was as if a week of June
                  had carelessly slipped out of its proper place, and was bent on asserting itself
                  in spite of the season.</p>
               <p>It was a Monday morning, and a busy, bustling time in the farm-kitchen. A cheerful
                  time, too, might be added, only, for some reason, Ruby was in that uncomfortable
                  state of mind that we designate as "being all out of sorts. How or why this phrase
                  describes a peculiar irritability of temper I cannot explain.</p>
               <p>Now Aunt Ruby was not at all freaky in her disposition, but of that order of sweet
                  temperament that serenely accepts things just as they come and makes the best of
                  them. So when she curtly declared that it was "miserable hot weather for winter,
                  good for nothing but to make folks sick," Hetty looked at her with surprise.</p>
               <p>"I thought you liked warm weather, aunty."</p>
               <p>"So I do, in its place. Don't like a hot brick<pb n="254-255"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000127"/> between two cakes of ice. If it holds on, that
                  cinnamon rose-bush at the south door will bud, and that's a sure sign of death in
                  the family."</p>
               <p>"I hardly think it will last long enough for that," said Mistress Bowen,
                  cheerfully. "We shall soon get a cold snap."</p>
               <p>"Suppose we shall, and catch our deaths a-freezing up after the thaw. I like to
                  see things equally 'stributed for one. But there's no use in wishing. There's that
                  ar' Fuss. He knew it was washing-day, and he's gone off a-fishing with our lazy
                  Jake, without putting out the clothes-line or fetching the rinsing-water. No sort
                  o' 'pendence on a man anywhere. When you want him most he aint there. Good mind to
                  leave his shirt for him to wash hisself. Be just good 'nuff for him.''</p>
               <p>"Why, I thought you wanted him to go fishing, aunty. It is a beautiful morning to
                  be on the water. If it hadn't been for churning this cream I would have gone too.
                  It seems just like summer out of doors."</p>
               <p>"There, now, missy," said Ruby disconsolately, "I told Fuss if he went off you
                  would have to churn. Never see any thing so aggravatin' as men is. It'll tire ye
                  clean out. Make you sick, as likely's not."</p>
               <p>"O! no, it wont. I've churned the butter many a time when father and Mark were
                  busy. After they went away, I had it to do every morning till you came. I told
                  Uncle Fuss I could do it. You see, aunty, I wanted some fresh fish."</p>
               <p>There was a pause in the conversation while Ruby dipped the hot water into her
                  tub, and filled the great brass kettle over the fire afresh. Then she went on,</p>
               <p>"'Spect he's forgot to water the critters. What he wants to drive them down to the
                  meadow-barn for, nobody knows. Makes it farther to go to feed 'em and milk 'em, if
                  that's what he wants."</p>
               <p>"We always take them there at this season. It is easier than bringing the hay up
                  here. The deacon talks of moving the barn nearer. His father built it there. But I
                  believe <emph>he</emph> thought it rather unhandy."</p>
               <p>Mistress Bowen's pleasant voice and smile softened Ruby's mood a little, but just
                  then she chanced, in moving her tub farther from the fire, to upset a pail of
                  water that stood behind the bench.</p>
               <p>"The land o' marcy!" ejaculated the poor woman, giving in at once to untoward
                  circumstances. "It's enough to make any body wish they had been dead and buried a
                  hundred years. There's all that slop to wipe up."</p>
               <p>"Why, aunty!" Hetty laughed merrily. "You<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6508-00000128"
                  /> must have got out of bed the wrong way this morning. Every thing goes wrong.
                  I'm sorry uncle forgot the clothes-line, but I'll help you put it out. And I'll
                  see to this puddle on the floor. You just let it be till the butter comes, and
                  then we'll see if things can't be brought into subjection."</p>
               <p>"No, missy." Ruby's face began to clear up. The bright young face opposite her had
                  a potent charm when matters looked disheartening.</p>
               <p>"Tell ye what," said Ruby, "I am just ashamed of myself. I don't know what makes
                  me so cross."</p>
               <p>"It isn't natural to you, aunty. You are as clever as a kitten."</p>
               <p>"Wal, I've had several times in my life," said Ruby, meditatively, as she shook
                  out a sheet that she had been wringing, "when I was too touchy to speak peaceably,
                  and this is one of the times."</p>
               <p>Just then the swift cantering of a horse coming up the road startled them. It
                  stopped at the gate, and before any one could look out the rider had dismounted
                  and stood in the open door. Hetty gave him one quick glance, then, without a
                  thought of appearances, she dropped the churn-dasher and rushed into his arms. Not
                  a word did she utter, but just clasped both her arms tightly around his neck and
                  clung to him with all her might.</p>
               <p>"Bless us all!" exclaimed Ruby in amazement. "If here aint Master Mark, as sure as
                  you're alive!"</p>
               <p>Mistress Bowen came running in from the dairy holding in her hand a great
                  clam-shell, that she used to skim milk. Her whole face glowed with a joyous
                  welcome. She might have followed Hetty's method of showing it if there had been
                  any way to get at him. "There, there, Hetty, let me at least have a chance to
                  shake hands with him," she said at last.</p>
               <p>Mark stooped his tall head over Hetty's shoulder, and laughingly kissed the still
                  handsome face that had so long filled the place of a mother's to him.</p>
               <p>"Dear Aunt Bowen, how natural and good you look! And Aunt Ruby is here too," he
                  added, reaching out one hand to meet hers, while the other still clasped Hetty.
                  The faithful colored woman's face shone with pleasure. Her petulancy vanished as
                  if by magic.</p>
               <p>"Now, Hetty, child," interrupted her mother, attempting to draw the young girl
                  away from Mark, "you must let him sit down and talk to us. Don't you want to ask
                  about your father?"</p>
               <p>Hetty's reply to this was a burst of tears<pb n="258-259"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000129"/> Joyful tears they were, though they told very
                  eloquently how the heart had yearned for the presence and sympathy of her old
                  companion and almost brother.</p>
               <p>"O you silly little puss! To cry because Mark has come! I think he deserves a more
                  cheerful welcome."</p>
               <p>"I can't help it, mother dear," sobbed Hetty, now drawing back shyly from Mark's
                  embrace with her face covered with blushes.</p>
               <p>"You came in so suddenly," said the mother, "it took her by surprise. She will
                  behave better the next time."</p>
               <p>Mark cared very little, just then, about the Puritan notions of decorum. He was
                  perfectly satisfied with his reception. His eyes followed the young girl as she
                  demurely went back to her work, and he thought he had never seen any thing so
                  beautiful in all his life. Her sudden timidity was quite as enchanting as the
                  frank welcome had been. He forgot that Mistress Bowen was anxiously awaiting news
                  from her absent husband, and that short-sighted matron, construing his silence
                  into reluctance to communicate bad tidings, felt her cheek grow pale with a sudden
                  dread.</p>
               <p>"You do not speak, Mark. There is nothing the matter with—"</p>
               <p>"With Uncle Bowen? Certainly not. I left him well and in good spirits. I have a
                  letter from him in my pocket. Here it is."</p>
               <p>"Is he looking well, Mark? Tell me the exact truth. You are thinner than you used
                  to be. How does he bear the exposures and privations of camp-life?"</p>
               <p>"Thanks to your care, Aunt Bowen, we have scarcely felt them. The poor fellows who
                  are too far from home to get supplies have suffered most. The blankets that you
                  sent have kept us comfortable at night, and uncle has not had a touch of his old
                  rheumatism. It is a pity he can't stay on, for the life agrees with him better
                  than with many of the younger men."</p>
               <p>"And there is no doubt that there are plenty of younger men who can be better
                  spared at home," she answered, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Yes. I am glad for your sake he will come home in March. I shall miss him, but we
                  must not be selfish."</p>
               <p>"You could not be if you tried."</p>
               <p>"I don't know. I have felt that it was a little selfish to enjoy those warm
                  blankets when others were shivering near us. You will believe that we stretched
                  them over as many as possible. If you had not made us promise to keep them for
                  ourselves, I think we must have given them away. We did venture to lend them when
                  a poor comrade fell sick."</p>
               <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6508-00000130"/>
               <p>"I suppose I should have done that."</p>
               <p>"Yes. So we thought. Then the provisions that you sent so often have saved many
                  lives to the army, I have no doubt. You see that a little dainty would start a
                  sick man's failing appetite, and, once started, it would keep running of
                  itself."</p>
               <p>"Yes. I've often noticed that at home."</p>
               <p>"I think Hetty must knit some kind of a charm into her stockings for us. They are
                  so warm and easy. I gave a pair of mine to a sick soldier from Connecticut, and he
                  said they made him dream of his mother."</p>
               <p>Hetty said nothing. She had been listening attentively, and furtively watching
                  Mark, as he knew. Let us look at him too.</p>
               <p>A tall, noble figure, with manly features, the dark eyes full of fire and
                  intellect. There is a mass of clustering brown hair above the broad, open
                  forehead, and when he smiles, as now, he shows white, regular teeth that have
                  never been discolored by that odious and unclean weed, tobacco. He has the lofty
                  bearing of a truly brave man, and a truthful simplicity of speech that commands
                  instant belief. There is a warmth of affection in his manner that invites people
                  to confide in him, that makes it a pleasure to rely on him. A stranger could not
                  look at him without a feeling of marked deference. How he appeared to Hetty we
                  cannot say, but she doubtless would have agreed with Miss Temperance Lincoln, who
                  had been heard to assert decidedly: "Wal, some men is men, and some men isn't.
                  Mark <emph>is.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Now, let me help you, Hetty," he said, coming to her side and taking the dasher
                  from her hand. "I haven't forgotten how to churn. See!" as a sudden change in the
                  sound of the strokes gave promise of victory, "it is just as it used to be. Don't
                  you remember how you used to say that I had only to touch the churn and the butter
                  came at once? Now, get your bonnet and come out with me—I must put up my horse,
                  poor fellow! He thinks I have forgotten him. Can you spare Hetty?" turning to
                  Mistress Bowen.</p>
               <p>"O! yes. How long can you stay at home?"</p>
               <p>"Only to-day. I must be back early to-morrow morning. But never mind that. I am
                  going to enjoy to-day, the whole of it. We will leave you to read Uncle Bowen's
                  letter. Hetty can read it afterward."</p>
               <p>A shrill neigh greeted them as they opened the door. It was immediately responded
                  to by Sylph from the stable.</p>
               <p>"Look, Hetty! This is your father's horse. You haven't forgotten Gray Billy. If
                  you have, he has not forgotten his old home."</p>
               <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6508-00000131"/>
               <p>"He remembers his stall better than he does his friends, Mark. He always did."</p>
               <p>"You never made his acquaintance, Hetty. He is a noble animal, not a bit skittish.
                  He has no bad habits, and he is a prime saddle-horse."</p>
               <p>"Is he?" Hetty's tone was slightly doubtful. Gray Billy was not exactly a lady's
                  pet, whatever good qualities he might have for a soldier.</p>
               <p>"If he is such a wonder he will want to be fed, I suppose."</p>
               <p>Sylph welcomed her old companion with continuous whinnies of delight. At first she
                  scarcely noticed Mark, who had once been on intimate terms with her; but when the
                  gray, after a brief salutation, turned to his breakfast in preference to her
                  society, she resented the slight, and coquettishly transferred her attentions to
                  his master.</p>
               <p>"She misses something," said Mark, watching the bright eyes that glanced wistfully
                  over his shoulder toward the door. "Come in, Hetty."</p>
               <p>The young girl had lingered outside to answer a call from her mother, who was
                  already hospitably anxious about the dinner. It was curious to see the change in
                  Sylph's demeanor when her mistress came up to the stall. She uttered a low cry of
                  positive delight, and held her head down to meet the caressing touch of the little
                  hand that fearlessly smoothed her dark, silky mane.</p>
               <p>"Ah! is she not a beauty?" said Hetty, fondly.</p>
               <p>"A wild one," replied Mark, smiling. "She is not half broken."</p>
               <p>"I can manage her. She is always gentle with me. If she had been broken, as you
                  call it, I might have lost her."</p>
               <p>Hetty was about to tell him of Joe's attempt to kidnap the beautiful animal, but
                  his next words turned her thoughts in another direction.</p>
               <p>"It seems so good to be at home, Hetty. Every thing looks so natural, so homelike.
                  The very rafters in the roof, and the rakes and forks to pull down the hay, are
                  like old friends. I can't tell you how dear the smallest trifles seem when one has
                  been away so long."</p>
               <p>Hetty looked up earnestly in his face, and her eyes again filled with tears. Her
                  artless emotion touched him more than any amount of regretful words could have
                  done.</p>
               <p>"Never mind, Hetty, let us enjoy to-day."</p>
               <p>"I can't, because to-morrow you will be gone, and the time will drag along hour by
                  hour, just as it has all the nine months that you have been away. If it were not
                  for mother I wouldn't try to live," said Hetty.</p>
               <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6508-00000132"/>
               <p>"Is that right, sister?"</p>
               <p>"Of course it isn't right. Right feelings don't grow out of wars. Now don't look
                  as if I were saying something wicked. I only speak out what I feel." Hetty's cheek
                  grew red and her voice tremulous.</p>
               <p>"It is worse for me than for you, Hetty," said Mark, in a low voice.</p>
               <p>"No, it isn't. You leave us here in our homes all safe and well provided for.
                  There is nothing for you to worry about." Hetty was only seventeen, but she
                  expressed the sad truth that the mothers and wives of soldiers have felt in all
                  times of war. "You have not got to shun a leisure hour as you would the plague,
                  because your thoughts will run on the dangers that threaten those you love; your
                  imagination wont always be picturing us in horrible straits and sufferings. You
                  have just got to endure what comes for yourself. I could be as brave as a lion in
                  your place. Don't you see?"</p>
               <p>"I certainly never saw the matter in that light before," Mark answered,
                  thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"Ah! that is the cruelty of war! So many hearts bleed when a brave fellow falls.
                  So many hearts are always heavy with a dread of bad news."</p>
               <p>"Let us look on the bright side, Hetty. Believe that God will keep me in safety;
                  that I shall come back to enjoy our well-earned liberties with you. I wonder if I
                  shall find you just the same. I shouldn't like to find you married and making some
                  other home pleasant. This place would hardly seem like home if you were gone."</p>
               <p>Hetty opened her dark eyes wide at this suggestion. "What a silly thought, Mark!
                  Who on earth should I marry?"</p>
               <p>"No one, I hope. But it may be years before I come back, and time brings
                  changes."</p>
               <p>"It wont change me. I wouldn't talk nonsense."</p>
               <p>"I always feel, Hetty, as if you belonged to me," Mark went on timidly, as if he
                  had not been sure of his place in her regard.</p>
               <p>"I think so, too," was the frank reply.</p>
               <p>"And it isn't fair for you to talk of my going off with strangers."</p>
               <p>Mark bit his lip to keep from laughing at this <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >naïve</foreign> speech.</p>
               <p>"Then, Hetty, if I live to come back, will you promise to be my wife?"</p>
               <p>Hetty started and colored painfully. The question was evidently wholly unexpected,
                  and, strange as it may seem, it was far from being agreeable.</p>
               <p>"O dear!" she exclaimed, pettishly, "there's always something to spoil every
                  thing."</p>
               <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6508-00000133"/>
               <p>It must be confessed that Mark did not feel flattered by her manner of receiving
                  his offer. Few young men would have been. His looks plainly showed his
                  disappointment.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry, Hetty, that I mentioned the subject," he said presently. "I thought
                  you would not dislike the idea that we belonged to each other."</p>
               <p>"I don't. But I don't see why we need be married. Don't you see, Mark," said
                  Hetty, nestling coaxingly to his side, "that it would be better than any thing in
                  the world to just have the old ways all back again, and live just as we used to?
                  There could not be any thing else so pleasant. If you and father only come safely
                  out of the war I shall be perfectly happy. I don't think I shall ever have another
                  wish."</p>
               <p>"But <emph>I</emph> shall, Hetty. I shall want my wife. And it must be you, or no
                  one."</p>
               <p>"Ah! well," said Hetty, sighing, "if it must be, it must. I dare say you'll get
                  over it, or be ashamed of it before the time comes. Anyway, there's no use in
                  borrowing trouble," she added philosophically. "I wonder what my father and mother
                  would say if they knew how foolish you are?"</p>
               <p>"Why, you don't suppose I should have said any thing of this kind to you without
                  their permission, do you?"</p>
               <p>"Do they approve?" asked Hetty, curiously.</p>
               <p>"Yes. Only they thought, or your father did, that it would be time enough to speak
                  of it when you were older. He says you are a mere child now. He forgets that Aunty
                  Bowen was younger when she married him."</p>
               <p>"But why couldn't you wait, as he wanted you to? For we shall not be married for a
                  long time yet, of course. What is the use of bothering about it now?"</p>
               <p>Hetty's blushes betrayed more sentiment than her words, and Mark drew her closer
                  to him as he answered: "Because I want you to promise to wait for me. I want you
                  to say that you will marry no one else."</p>
               <p>"I will promise all that," answered Hetty, readily. "Why, I wouldn't have any
                  other man round here if you would give me a farm. Fuss does well enough; I like to
                  talk to him, and he is never in the way. But I wouldn't go off to live in a
                  strange house with any man living."</p>
               <p>"Not even with me, Hetty?" he persisted. "If I were obliged to live in some
                  distant place, would you not come with me?"</p>
               <p>A vivid flush rose to her brow. A sudden conviction that she would joyfully go
                  with him to the ends of the earth, if so she might escape the pain of parting from
                  him, silenced the lips that would fain have answered carelessly. Her<pb
                     n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6508-00000134"/> face was too expressive for disguise,
                  and Mark read her thoughts easily, smiling as he noted the shy, downcast look, so
                  new and so bewitching.</p>
               <p>"Don't ask any more disagreeable questions," she pleaded, "because we have only
                  one day. Don't let us waste it. Look at Sylph. She is waiting to hear you say
                  something sensible."</p>
               <p>Mark longed to kiss the rosy mouth that was so chary of promises, but he only
                  ventured to caressingly smooth the bright hair that, after its old manner, escaped
                  from confinement too often to follow any fashion in its arrangement.</p>
               <p>"Mark, does not Gray Billy start when he hears the cannon?"</p>
               <p>"Not at all. His nerves are like iron."</p>
               <p>Hetty looked with some interest upon the noble animal, now dignified as an army
                  horse.</p>
               <p>"Sylph would jump out of her skin if a gun were fired near her. She is too pretty
                  for fight."</p>
               <p>"Yes. So is her mistress. But Billy is a capital fellow. Your father has given him
                  to me. I am in the cavalry, you know. And, Hetty," said Mark, with a glow on his
                  cheek, "Joe Humphreys' prophecy has come true, for I rank as captain."</p>
               <p>"Well, I suppose you think it an honor. But I would not give a straw for it. You
                  will have to lead your men, so the danger will be greater. Still, it will plague
                  Joe, which is worth something thing. O, Mark! if you could only be in the choir
                  one Sunday and see him show off!"</p>
               <p>"I should only see you, Hetty. Do you know you haven't answered my question
                  yet?"</p>
               <p>"I think," said Hetty, decidedly, "that we had better go into the house. Mother
                  will want me to help her."</p>
               <p>He did not reply, but he turned her round so that the light shone on her face, and
                  looked at her attentively.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Hetty, you are a very child yet, as your father said. It would be wrong to
                  bind you to me with promises that, as a woman, you might not feel free to keep. It
                  shall be as you wish. We will wait till the war is over before we speak of the
                  future."</p>
               <p>Hetty looked up quickly, a little puzzled by the sudden change in his manner.</p>
               <p>"You are not angry, Mark?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed; only reasonable. I value your affection for me above every thing
                  else, but I cannot help knowing that I may be away for years, and that a stronger
                  love for some one else may influence you as you grow older. God forbid that any
                  engagement to me should ever stand in the way of your happiness. Come, let us go
                  in."</p>
               <p>But Hetty now hesitated. Her cheek paled, and she trembled all over.</p>

               <p>"You are not satisfied, Hetty?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know. You look so grave, as if it were a funeral," said Hetty. "I don't
                  understand myself; but I don't want you to give me up. And I will never love that
                  'some one else. 'I shall just keep as I am. Perhaps I shall grow wiser," she
                  added, roguishly, "but you wont mind that. And if you are killed in battle, I will
                  die too."</p>
               <p>This time the temptation of the sweet lips was too much for him, and Mark bent
                  down and kissed them. Was he to blame?</p>

               <p>MISTRESS BOWEN was still reading her letter when they returned to the house.</p>
               <p>"The deacon writes that some change is confidently expected in the army."</p>
               <p>"Yes. We are getting ready to move."</p>
               <p>"And there is less and less prospect of peace?"</p>
               <p>"There can be no peace, Aunt Bowen, while the British think only of subduing us.
                  We don't want a peace that makes slaves of us."</p>
               <p>"No. But when I think of their wealth and our poverty, and how little our troops
                  are prepared to meet their trained soldiers, I lose my courage."</p>
               <p>"The right must conquer in the long run. God is on the side of the right," said
                  Mark, reverently. "It is safe to trust our cause with him."</p>
               <p>"He lets people do awful wicked things sometimes," said Hetty. "The Old
                     Testament<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6508-00000136"/> is full of them. What does
                  General Washington think of our chances?"</p>
               <p>Mark could not help smiling, in spite of the seeming irreverence that turned from
                  God's providence to inquire of human wisdom. "The general thinks that the struggle
                  for liberty may last for years, but that we shall never give it up until success
                  is ours. The English may as well understand this first as last."</p>
               <p>"They do not know us, Mark. And they have no idea of the strength that their
                  domineering ways gives to our cause. They act as if we were a set of ignorant
                  savages, and could only be influenced by force."</p>
               <p>"That is true, aunt, but the British are not our worst foes. If it were not for
                  their Tory adherents we could soon win the victory. The land is full of traitors.
                  It is this that cripples us. There are spies in every neighborhood, and it is
                  nearly impossible to detect them. Such men as the Humphreys are not scarce, and
                  they seem capable of any meanness."</p>
               <p>"I don't think they have spunk enough to do much hurt. Old Humphreys wouldn't
                  leave the chimney-corner unless compelled to do so."</p>
               <p>"But Joe is both active and malicious."</p>
               <p>"Yes; and insignificant. You shake your head. Surely, Mark, you do not think such
                  persons can hinder the cause to any serious extent?"</p>
               <p>"Can they not? Were they not just such Tory sneaks who robbed the islands in the
                  bay of their produce, and took it in boats to sell to the enemy in Boston? All
                  along the shore the farmers have been robbed, and the best horses have been stolen
                  for the use of the British. There is nothing too mean for them to do."</p>
               <p>"I hope their time will be short. What is this change that is anticipated in the
                  army?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot tell. All sorts of rumors are afloat among us. We know that in the
                  council of war General Washington has three times proposed an attack on Boston,
                  and that at last a closer investment of the town is ordered. There is a different
                  feeling in the camp. I cannot describe it to you, but it means action. The troops
                  are regaining their cheerfulness and courage. Then the winter is nearly over. Cold
                  and privation and fatigue are not hopeful stimulants. We are waking up," said
                  Mark, rising and pacing rapidly up and down the kitchen, "and if we can once get a
                  chance at those fellows in town, they will be astonished to see how the 'untrained
                  barbarians,' as they call us, can fight. You look surprised, Hetty."</p>
               <p>"Do I? It is because you talk so fast. You used to be so quiet. Not silent,
                     exactly<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6508-00000137"/> ly, but not like this. Is
                  talking a military exercise?"</p>
               <p>Hetty asked the question with a gravity that deceived her mother, but Mark
                  detected the mischief in her eyes.</p>
               <p>"I have sociable spells," he answered, laughing, "and this is one."</p>
               <p>There was certainly no danger of his becoming taciturn if he answered one half of
                  the questions asked him. The slightest details of camp-life had an interest for
                  his two questioners, and he had many inquiries to make about the affairs at
                  home.</p>
               <p>"Poor Aunt Hannah!" he said, after hearing the sad particulars of her sickness and
                  death, "I wish I could have seen her before she died."</p>
               <p>"She mentioned you often, Mark, and she left her clock, that you used to admire,
                  to be given to you. But the heirs claimed it, and it was sold for a trifle at the
                  vendue. I have been trying to buy it back for you," said Mistress Bowen, "but Joe
                  Humphreys bought it, and he wont sell it at any price to us."</p>
               <p>"Let him keep it," said Mark. "I shall know that the dear old lady meant it for me
                  all the same."</p>
               <p>How soon the short February day flitted by! It seemed scarcely an hour after
                  Mark's arrival before the sun began to sink in the west.</p>
               <p>Ruby cooked the dinner, and they all sat down to the table, but, as she said, "it
                  was all talk and no eat." It was nearly night when Fuss came back from a
                  successful day's fishing, and so there was no interruption to the conversation,
                  every word of which was to linger in the memory for years.</p>
               <p>It was almost dark, when a happy thought crossed Mistress Bowen's brain:—</p>
               <p>"Hetty, child," she said eagerly, "I would bake a cake to send to your father if
                  we only had some eggs. It would seem like home to him."</p>
               <p>"Yes, mother dear," assented Hetty.</p>
               <p>"But we can't make it, child, without eggs. The hens have all stopped laying at
                  once," she explained to Mark.</p>
               <p>"Not all, mother!" exclaimed Hetty, springing up with alacrity. "I found old
                  Speckle's nest yesterday. She had hidden it under the south corner of the barn. I
                  counted the eggs in it. There were seven, so she can spare some very well. I'll
                  bring them in a minute."</p>
               <p>Throwing a light shawl over her head, she sped with airy, girlish grace down the
                  path, and disappeared around the corner of the barn before Mark had time to offer
                  to go in her stead. It was well for him that she did so.</p>
               <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6508-00000138"/>
               <p>"I must be as still as I can," said Hetty to herself as she edged her slender
                  figure under the barn-sill to reach for the eggs, "because if Sylph hears me there
                  will be no peace unless I pay her a visit. One, two, three, four. That will do.
                  Now, Mrs. Speckle, you have room to work in."</p>
               <p>Just here Hetty's thoughts were arrested by a low, murmured conversation in the
                  barn directly over her head. One of the voices she recognized in a moment. That
                  nasal drawl could belong to no one but Joe Humphreys. And his presence on the
                  premises betokened mischief.</p>
               <p>Hetty's cramped position was not comfortable, but she set herself to listen with
                  all her powers.</p>
               <p>"Ya'as. The biggest horse is Cap'n Mark's. Used to be the deacon's best. The other
                  is the critter I spoke about. She's fiery as a hornet, but that's
                     <emph>your</emph> lookout."</p>
               <p>"I ain't afeard," answered a strange voice. "Never seed the horse yet that I
                  couldn't break in. Aint a bit afeard to try my hand on this one. Can coax her away
                  just like a book, soon as you think the coast is clear."</p>
               <p>"Wal, you can try it. No harm in that. Just you wait till that nigger Fuss has
                  taken them down to drink, and shut up for the night. Wonder where he thinks his
                  big dog is. Don't see how you managed to fool him."</p>
               <p>"Why, old Fuss had him of my father. He was raised at our house. Likely dog, too.
                  He knows more than half the folks."</p>
               <p>"He'll know you when he sees you again," said Joe.</p>
               <p>"Expect he will. If we have good luck, you must go back and shoot him. I would
                  have done it, but I thought the sound of the gun might make Cap'n Mark a leetle
                  suspicious."</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't go near him for any money." Joe's voice was shaky.</p>
               <p>"You're a great case," said his companion, sneeringly. "What are you afeard of? I
                  muzzled him so he couldn't bite or yell to save his life."</p>
               <p>"I don't seem to remember just where he is."</p>
               <p>"Don't ye? That aint quite so true as the Bible, but I'll tell ye."</p>
               <p>"Sha'n't go out of my way to do it."</p>
               <p>"No. You'll make it come in your way." This was said in a decided tone that Joe
                  did not venture to dispute. "He's close by the bridge. First bridge you come to in
                  the woods, and the last, too, for that matter. What's the use of telling you? You
                  remember it as well as I do. Make short work of him. I don't want him to be
                  murdered by inches."</p>
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6508-00000139"/>
               <p>"Hadn't you better do it youself?"</p>
               <p>"No, I tell you. I shall have my hands full with these horses. That is a pretty
                  critter. I mean the mare. The other will do the most service, but this will be a
                  prime one arter I've broke her in."</p>
               <p>Hetty shuddered. Her heart beat so loudly that she feared they would hear it in
                  the barn above her, but she still listened.</p>
               <p>"Now, about Cap'n Mark," said Joe. "You are sure Seth White will help you take
                  him?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. I shall call out Steve Orcutt, too, as I go along. Best to have men enough.
                  As soon as we get these horses off I will cut across lots, and tell the boys what
                  sport is up. Mark will have to go over King Oak Hill, and we'll wait for him
                  there. It is as good a spot as there is on the road, no houses near. Seth's boat
                  is down in Hockley Cove, and Kiah Webb's smack over on the Hingham side. Just get
                  him into Seth's boat, and I'll agree to give him a free passage to Boston."</p>
               <p>They both laughed at this. Hetty scarcely breathed, though her courage began to
                  return as a plan for outwitting the rascals dawned upon her mind.</p>
               <p>"He'll get a free berth in a British ship," chuckled Joe. "They'll soon cool his
                  spunk."</p>
               <p>"Stretch his neck, more likely," was the cool response. "'Cordin' to your story,
                  he is one of the ringleaders among the rebels."</p>
               <p>"Ya'as. Used to get the young fellows together, and read all sorts of rebel stuff,
                  two years ago. Did more hurt than any other ten men."</p>
               <p>"Tell ye what, Joe. We shall get money, and credit, too, if we carry this thing
                  out."</p>
               <p>"Wal, I reckon we shall do it. No one saw us come in here. They're too busy up to
                  the house a-hearing and admiring the cap'n. Guess they'll change their tune afore
                  this time to-morrow. Now, Jim, we had better lie close, and keep still till the
                  ground is clear. That old nigger is keener than a fox. Can almost hear a fellow
                  think."</p>
               <p>Hetty slipped out of her uncomfortable listening-place, and sped silently up the
                  path to the house. At the door she met Mark and Fuss, who were both coming to see
                  what had detained her. In a few whispered words she put them in possession of the
                  situation. Mark set his lips together in the resolute way that Hetty had often
                  seen when he was bent on any difficult enterprise. But Fuss took the business into
                  his own hands. His black eyes sparkled like stars in the twilight.</p>
               <p>"You just leave me to fix dem fellers, little missy. Massa Mark, will you walk
                  over to that<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6508-00000140"/> bridge, first of all, and
                  let Jupe loose? I'll tend to dese Tories. 'Spect I catch 'em both."</p>
               <p>"How?"</p>
               <p>"You go right along. I'll tell you when you get back. I want Jupe. He's worth a
                  dozen men when such a poor coward as that Joe needs seeing to. The other scamp
                  must be Jim Bates. The dog knows him and likes him, too."</p>
               <p>Mark started off for the woods, and Fuss, after a moment's consultation with
                  Hetty, sauntered leisurely down to the barn, carelessly whistling a tune as he
                  went. The first thing he did was to examine the two back doors. They were securely
                  locked, just as they had been ever since Hetty's knowledge of Joe's attempt to
                  steal Sylph. A grin spread over his dark features, for he saw at once that Joe had
                  no knowledge of the fastenings.</p>
               <p>In his hiding-place, Joe wondered "what that nigger was up to," and tried in vain
                  to get a look at his proceedings.</p>
               <p>"Now, my beauties," said Fuss, approaching the horses, "'spect ye've both told all
                  the news you could think of by this time. Glad to see each other, aint ye? Ate
                  your suppers up all clean, too. Now you want to go down to the brook and take a
                  drink together for old acquaintance sake."</p>
               <p>Fuss whistled two or three bars of his tune a second time, while he took down and
                  carried out the saddle and bridle that belonged to Mark's horse.</p>
               <p>"Steady, Sylph!" he went on, for the benefit of his concealed audience. "Don't be
                  in such a hurry. Let me take this chap out first. He's company, and you must show
                  your perliteness. Besides, he'll wait at the door a minute and <emph>you</emph>
                  wont. Arter you've had your drink, you can talk all night together if you want
                  to."</p>
               <p>Joe nudged his companion gleefully as he heard this.</p>
               <p>"Now, then," said Fuss, as he led Sylph out, "you just wait a minute, both of you,
                  while I see to this door-hinge. Can't have it draggin' down, nohow. There! guess
                  it'll swing easy, now. Back, Sylph! let me try it."</p>
               <p>The heavy doors swung together; the staples in the great cross-bar shot into their
                  places, and, in a twinkling, Fuss slipped the padlock through and turned the key
                  securely.</p>
               <p>At the same moment, the panting sound of a huge dog, out of breath with running,
                  was heard, and Jupe, quite beside himself with delight, and barking furiously to
                  show it, jumped upon his master's shoulders with a force that nearly threw him
                  over.</p>
               <p>"Thunderation!" ejaculated Joe, who had been listening to Fuss with the greatest
                     curiosity<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6508-00000141"/> osity. "That big hound has
                  got loose, sure as fate."</p>
               <p>"The old Harry must have helped him," answered Jim. "He never loosed himself. But
                  I guess I can manage him."</p>
               <p>"That shows how much you know about it. Why, that dog is set regularly to watch
                  this barn. I've been over here at night a dozen times, and he's always here. You
                  can't touch a thing if he's round. No use in trying. He's as savage as a
                  tiger."</p>
               <p>"Yes. I know he is. And <emph>I</emph> shouldn't be just the one to coax him. So
                  we'd better be making tracks while he's down there with the horses. We can trap
                  the cap'n anyway."</p>
               <p>"Yes," snarled Joe. "We've got to be in a hurry, too. We must go out of one of
                  these back doors and keep out of sight."</p>
               <p>"Wal, why don't you open it? What are you waiting for?"</p>
               <p>"It wont open. Don't see what ails the pesky thing. Try the other."</p>
               <p>"I am trying it. Can't start it a hair. Where's that dog?"</p>
               <p>"Down by the brook. Don't you hear him? We must risk the great door, then. If they
                  see us we must make some errand, as if we had just come on the premises."</p>
               <p>"They wont see us if we hurry. Come, just lend a hand. What ever possessed that
                  nigger to shut it? There's no way to open it on the inside. Hark! They're coming
                  back. What shall we do now?"</p>
               <p>"Do? Why hide again till they're off."</p>
               <p>Back to their covert among the hay slunk the two cowards, trembling with a fear
                  that Jupe would, with his keen scent, detect their presence and bring them
                  ignominiously forth to judgment. Both listened with breathless attention to the
                  voices outside.</p>
               <p>"Uncle Fuss," said Mark, "that is a fine large dog of yours. He looks as if he
                  knew something, too."</p>
               <p>"He knows as much as any body. Mor'n the sneaking Tories do. If I tell him to
                  'tend to a thing, he does it. Never tries to shirk."</p>
               <p>"Where does he sleep?"</p>
               <p>"Close by. Do you see that great box under the corn-house?"</p>
               <p>"It don't look like a box."</p>
               <p>"Well, it aint exactly. It is Jupe's house. He sleeps there with his door
                  open."</p>
               <p>"For the accommodation of visitors," said Mark, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Just so. It is his business to watch the barn. I shouldn't like to be in any
                  body's shoes that dared to come poking round here arter I give him his
                  orders."</p>
               <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6508-00000142"/>
               <p>"Is he really so dangerous?"</p>
               <p>"He'd kill a strange man quicker'n dip. Wouldn't stop to meditate."</p>
               <p>"I'm glad he is so trusty."</p>
               <p>"I've given him to missy. He will mind her just as he does me. So when the deacon
                  comes home and I go back to the cabin, he'll stay. Every family needs a good,
                  trusty watch-dog."</p>
               <p>"That is true. Shall I help you about the horses?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir. I am going to take them down to the other barn."</p>
               <p>"What for?"</p>
               <p>"O! I has my reasons. You jest take that saddle and bridle into the house, so I
                  can give 'em a good rubbin' arter I have done up the chores. The moon is getting
                  up a piece. It'll be a fine night."</p>
               <p>"Yes. I shall enjoy my ride back to camp. Don't get up to see to the horses,
                  uncle. I shall have to rise early and I can give Billy his breakfast."</p>
               <p>"I shall 'tend to all that myself," said Fuss, resolutely. "You jest sleep as long
                  as you can. Here, Jupe, my boy, you see to this barn till I dismisses you."</p>
               <p>A deep growl was Jupe's reply.</p>
               <p>"There, sir, he understands. I don't feed him at night, for I want him to be
                  savage."</p>
               <p>"So he always watches the barn?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. It's to please little missy. No need of it, though, since I put on the big
                  locks. Should like to see any body get in or out arter I turn the key. Here's the
                  key. Just heft it. Stout enough to lock up a jail. Put on the locks to please
                  missy. She's powerful afeard of losing her horse. Small danger of that now," said
                  Fuss, with a dry chuckle.</p>
               <p>Mark could not help laughing heartily at the negro's ingenious way of imparting.
                  information to the unlucky prisoners, and at the dismay that he knew the
                  information would create. He knew Joe well enough to be sure that he was quaking
                  with fear. Of Jim Bates he knew nothing, except that he belonged to a low family
                  who lived in a dirty-looking hut down on the shore, and were too lazy to earn an
                  honest living. How they lived was a mystery, for except raising dogs, and fishing
                  occasionally, they seemed to have no regular occupation.</p>
               <p>"Wal," said Joe, as the footsteps died away and left them to their reflections,
                  "this is what I call a pretty considerable of a fix. Regular trap we're in."</p>
               <p>"Locked in, guarded by a big bloodhound, nothing to eat, or drink, or to smoke,"
                  said his companion, enumerating the advantages of their position. "The next time,
                  Joe Humphreys,<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6508-00000143"/> that you catch me on a
                  bender like this, I'll calculate the chances myself."</p>
               <p>"Better calculate the chances of getting out of this scrape first," answered Joe,
                  crossly.</p>
               <p>"O! I shall get off well enough. They'll open the doors in the morning, of course.
                  If they don't, I shall holler till they do. Then I shall tell them that you
                  brought me here to look at a horse that was for sale, and while we were waiting to
                  see some one, we fell asleep."</p>
               <p>"Pooh! That silly yarn wouldn't blind a skeeter," said Joe, who was much quicker
                  witted than his companion. "Besides, that nigger understands all about it now.
                  That was plain enough."</p>
               <p>"I don't believe that."</p>
               <p>"I tell you he does. And so does Cap'n Mark, and the women too, hang 'em! They
                  know we're trapped in this blasted old barn, and they are laughing to kill over
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Let 'em laugh," said Jim, philosophically. "I would if I could see any thing to
                  laugh at. As it is, I am going to sleep."</p>
               <p>"Sleep!" exclaimed Joe, indignantly. "I guess I shall sleep a good deal in this
                  old jail, with that ar' dog a-prowling outside."</p>
               <p>"Why, you don't want him inside, do you? If you wont go to sleep yourself, you can
                  keep your noisy yawp still, can't you?"</p>
               <p>All this conversation between the young conspirators was well spiced with profane
                  oaths. That part we leave unwritten, for we would as soon permit swearing in our
                  parlor as in our book.</p>
               <p>Jim Bates was soon asleep, snoring away as peacefully as if he were in his bed at
                  home. He was used to the vagabond style of living, and he never looked ahead for
                  trouble. He was safe until morning, "couldn't be safer," as he assured Joe the
                  last thing before he yielded himself to slumber. For Joe there was no rest or
                  sleep. He was obliged to keep quiet, for the least noise was responded to by a
                  deep growl outside that sent terror to his heart. So he sat still on the hay,
                  pondering over and over a double problem that he would never be able to solve,
                  stating it to himself in the clearest manner, on this wise: "How on earth did that
                  nigger find out that we were in the barn, and who let that dog loose?"</p>
               <p>In the house there was but little disposition to sleep. Mistress Bowen baked her
                  cake in a shallow iron kettle that nestled comfortably on a bed of mingled coals
                  and ashes, and had a hot layer of the same upon its cover.</p>
               <p>O the delicious cakes that used to be baked in bake-kettles! This one came out
                  light as a sponge, and fragrant with cinnamon and<pb n="288-289"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000144"/> allspice; with inquiring raisins peeping out in
                  spots through the brown upper crust, and speckling its sides. It was a cake that
                  would be very suggestive of home to the absent soldier. Mark declared that if he
                  were traveling in Africa, and came across such a cake, he should know that Aunt
                  Bowen made it, just as well as if her name were on the crust.</p>
               <p>Hetty did not go to bed at all. "Let me sit here and keep the fire, mother dear,"
                  she said, after Mark had retired to his room.</p>
               <p>"The fire will keep itself. I think you had better go to bed."</p>
               <p>"But I am not sleepy. I couldn't sleep a wink if I tried. Those creatures in the
                  barn would haunt me. It is twelve o'clock now, and we must get an early breakfast
                  for Mark. Let me sit up, please."</p>
               <p>"You can try it if you choose. I think you will get tired of it in a little time.
                  You are not used to watching, and it will be dull here alone."</p>
               <p>"Never mind. I can come to bed if I get tired."</p>
               <p>Left to herself, Hetty put out the candle, and sat down on a low stool before the
                  fire. The moonlight shone pleasantly in at the windows, mingling its pale rays
                  with the red flicker of the firelight, and making every object in the room clearly
                  distinguishable. The faint illumination of the candle was scarcely missed at
                  all.</p>
               <p>Feeling a little tired, she pulled the armchair near enough to lean her head on
                  its cushions, and thus comfortably disposed, began to think over the events of the
                  day. The thinking process was a short one, for she had only gone over the surprise
                  of Mark's arrival, when the drooping lids shut over the bright eyes, and Hetty was
                  fast asleep.</p>
               <p>A lovely picture she made in the rosy glow of the fire. Her hair had slipped out
                  of the net that partially confined it during the day, and now fell in a wavy mass
                  over her shoulders, enveloping her with a shining drapery. She wore a homespun
                  checked gown, cut after the fashion of the day, with a waist so short that the
                  belt passed close under her arms. No pretty collar at the neck, or cuffs at the
                  wrist, relieved its plainness; no flashy brooch or brilliant ribbon fastened it at
                  the throat. Yet it was by no means unbecoming to its wearer. Hetty's beauty was
                  not at all dependent on dress, and no costume could have heightened the simple
                  grace of her figure as she sat half reclined before the fire.</p>
               <p>So Mark thought when he came softly down stairs to feed his horse before starting.
                     No<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6508-00000145"/> one was stirring in the house,
                  for it lacked nearly an hour of the time that Fuss had appointed for rising
                  himself. He did not disturb her, but, seeing how early it was, he sat down quietly
                  in the opposite corner instead of going out.</p>
               <p>As he looked round the comfortable room and felt the warm glow of the fire he
                  sighed involuntarily. We cannot blame him. Here was home and comfort, glorified by
                  beauty and love, and all to be exchanged in a few hours for danger and unlimited
                  hardship.</p>
               <p>Suddenly Hetty stirred and opened her eyes A sense of his presence must have been
                  with her in her sleep, for she evinced no surprise, and did not seem at all
                  startled to see him sitting near her. She did not speak, but just moved her seat
                  to his side and laid her head on his knee. The childish confidence and clinging
                  dependence of this mute appeal for sympathy moved him deeply. Yes, it was very
                  hard to leave Hetty and home. Her first words made it harder yet. "Mark, you said
                  out there," nodding her head toward the barn, "that you loved me better than any
                  thing in the world."</p>
               <p>"Yes," he answered, surprised that she should mention it of her own accord.</p>
               <p>"If it were true, Mark, you would stay with me."</p>
               <p>"And sacrifice duty and honor? Surely, Hetty, you would not ask that?"</p>
               <p>"Have you no duty to me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. The duty of defending your rights and privileges. Why, Hetty! I thought you
                  had learned to look at these things differently. Your father told me that you had
                  become a fiery little patriot."</p>
               <p>"I don't know about that. Of course," said Hetty, naïvely, "I don't want the
                  British to beat us, and—and I often feel that I should like to fight them myself;
                  and I think it is as mean as it can be to be a Tory, or to use any thing that
                  comes from English trade, but—"</p>
               <p>"Well!"</p>
               <p>"It is all outside spunk, Mark, for in my heart I feel that I would gladly give up
                  the rights that you speak of if I could have you and father at home. If you are
                  killed in battle—and I suppose you will be," said Hetty, nestling closer to
                  him—"all the victories that can be imagined wont help me to bear it."</p>
               <p>"Not even the good they might secure to the country, Hetty?"</p>
               <p>"No. I am too selfish to care for that. The rejoicings would just madden me. I
                  don't want any blessings bought at such a price."</p>
               <p>"Hetty!"</p>
               <p>"It seems wicked to you, I suppose. I am<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6508-00000146"
                  /> only saying out what thousands of women feel. War is a cruel, terrible thing.
                  All the talk about victory and glory don't alter that."</p>
               <p>Mark did not try to answer. It was of no use to repeat what he had so often
                  explained, that it was a war of necessity, forced upon the American people by
                  numerous acts of oppression. She would remember all this when he was far away. At
                  present she was only alive to the pain of separation. In silence, he smoothed back
                  the disordered hair from her forehead, charmed with the childishness that was so
                  unreasonable, and yet became so well the youthful face and figure.</p>
               <p>"You don't speak," said Hetty, raising her head with sudden petulance. "You might
                  at least lecture me. I know you want to."</p>
               <p>"Lecture you? I think I shall never do that again. I am sorry for you, that is
                  all."</p>
               <p>"Not sorry for yourself?" she urged. "You like to go?"</p>
               <p>"O Hetty!" said Mark, rising suddenly and pacing the room rapidly, "I pray God
                  that you may never feel the pain that the struggle between inclination and duty
                  brings to me. His voice shook with emotion.</p>
               <p>Hetty's mood changed instantly. The true, womanly instinct to comfort and
                  strengthen sprang into life. She went up to him and laid her hand on his arm.</p>
               <p>"Mark," she said in a low voice, so changed from the querulous tone of her last
                  words that he turned in surprise to look at her—"Mark, I am ashamed of myself. I
                  have behaved like a silly baby. Forgive me this once, and I promise to be a woman
                  in future. Indeed, Mark, I am not so foolish generally. Ask mother if I am not
                  brave and cheerful."</p>
               <p>Mark's look of relief more than paid for her attempt at self-control.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Hetty, keep up a good heart, if only for my sake. Let me think of you as
                  being happy and merry."</p>
               <p>"Hark! I hear Uncle Fuss tumbling out of bed." Hetty laughed lightly, though her
                  lips quivered with a counter-inclination to cry. "What will he do with these poor
                  fellows in the barn?"</p>
               <p>"I advised him to keep them till they are pretty hungry, and then leave the doors
                  open."</p>
               <p>"It will be some time before they will care to meddle with us again."</p>
               <p>"It is strange that Joe has not tired of it long ago. It is not success,
                  certainly, that keeps his courage up."</p>
               <p>"No; it is spite."</p>
               <p>Mistress Bowen now made her appearance,<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6508-00000147"/>
                  followed by Ruby, and the preparations for breakfast began. It was labor lost, for
                  no one could eat. Mark tried hard to do justice to the excellent fare before
                  him.</p>
               <p>"It is of no use, Aunt Bowen," he said at last, "I am not hungry. I will take a
                  lunch in my pocket to eat on the road."</p>
               <p>There was little time for sorrowful leave-taking. Hetty was true to her brave
                  resolution. She kept a bright, cheerful face to the last, though he saw that she
                  could not trust her voice to respond to his farewell.</p>
               <p>When he was out of sight, and her mother turned to speak to her, she had
                  vanished.</p>
               <p>Joe Humphreys heard Mark's horse canter down the road with a feeling of baffled
                  rage that, for a moment, overcame his sense of personal peril.</p>
               <p>"S'pose he's been a-setting up with Hetty a-courtin' all this blasted night. And
                  now he goes a-riding off to the fools that made him cap'n, as happy as a clam at
                  high water. O dear!" said Joe, "I wish—"</p>
               <p>But it was quite impossible to invent a wish adequate to the occasion, so he gave
                  up the effort, and lay back hopelessly by his sleeping companion.</p>
               <p>A little after sunrise he roused up again, and this time Jim Bates started to his
                  elbow. Across the meadow he heard his father's voice calling to Fuss:—</p>
               <p>"Hullo! You haint seen any thing of our Joe over this way, have ye?"</p>
               <p>"No. Have ye lost him?"</p>
               <p>"Wal, he didn't come home last night, and his mother consaited that something had
                  happened to him. He never stays out nights, you see. He's too lazy. And there's
                  nothing to stay out for."</p>
               <p>"Guess you'll hear of him afore long," said Fuss. "Have you inquired down to Peter
                  Bates's? He's pretty thick with their Jim, I've heerd."</p>
               <p>"No. And I aint a-going way down there to please my wife or any other woman."</p>
               <p>"Tell ye what I can do for ye," said Fuss. "If you don't see him by to-morrow, you
                  jest bring over something that he has worn for clothes and let Jupe smell of it.
                  He'll get on his track and nose him out for ye mighty quick."</p>
               <p>"Yes. I will think about it," said the old man, turning round and walking
                  leisurely homeward. For the second time Joe found no words to express his
                  emotions.</p>
               <p>It was a sorrowful day for Hetty. In spite of herself her thoughts followed Mark,
                  and dwelt upon that most cruel chance of war—the<pb n="296-297"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000148"/> probability that she should never see him again.
                  Toward night she began to feel more hopeful. The dangers were the same, but God
                  was good, and he <emph>might</emph> come back.</p>
               <p>"Never bury your friends until they are dead," her mother said. "There is always
                  time to hold funerals."</p>
               <p>Just at nightfall Fuss came in and suggested that they all repair to the garret to
                  watch the release of his two prisoners.</p>
               <p>"I'll set the great door open, and then take Jupe with me down to water the
                  critters. Guess them chaps will be scarce by the time I get back. Reckon they'll
                  have an appetite for their suppers."</p>
               <p>They were a merry trio of spectators in the high garret. It was worth a farm, as
                  Hetty said, to see the two culprits peep cautiously out of the door, and then scud
                  round the corner into the road. They didn't stop for any parting compliments with
                  each other. Jim hurried down the road, while Joe took a short cut across the
                  meadow.</p>
               <p>"Two miserable scamps they is," said Ruby. "Regular fools, too, to come thieving
                  here when my Fuss is round. But then," she added resignedly, "some men is
                  fools."</p>
               <p>"Uncle Fuss isn't, though. He's punished them nicely, I think."</p>
               <p>"Missis Bowen," said Ruby, with a look of mystery as if she were propounding a
                  riddle, "what do you think our lazy Jake has been up to all this blessed
                  winter?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing wicked, I hope."</p>
               <p>"Wal, he's jest been a-courtin Siah Webb's Jubilee, and now the poor, shif'less
                  critters want to set up for themselves, and both on 'em aint wuth two 'tater
                  parings."</p>
               <p>How Hetty laughed at this news!" Why, Aunt Ruby! She's as big as two of him!"</p>
               <p>"Makes no kind o' odds. A miserable match, any way. We'll have to take her home,
                  and she'll fill the house. If he must be a fool, missy, why couldn't he have
                  courted Candy Slade? She hasn't any gumption as to work, but then she's a little
                  thing, and we could set her in the corner."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE DEACON AT HOME AGAIN.</head>
               <p>WITH the earliest breath of spring came a thrill of expectation all over the
                  country. People scarcely knew what to look for, yet there was a general feeling
                  that important events were pending.</p>
               <p>The dignified firmness of Congress and of the army precluded the possibility of
                  any compromise that did not secure the largest liberty for American citizens, and
                  the daily provocations of the English forbade the hope of peace without war. There
                  were Committees of Correspondence in all the towns, and, by their means, the
                  deliberations and conclusions of the leading patriots were known in an incredibly
                  short time all over the land—that is, in a short time, considering the means for
                  transmitting information.</p>
               <p>The mails, carried by the slow, lumbering stage-coaches, over roads as rough as
                  any new country ever had, were not daily mails. Indeed, the majority of the most
                  considerable towns thought themselves fortunate in securing a mail once a week.
                  There were innumerable branch mail-bags which were carried on horseback into the
                  more sparsely-settled regions, and they were welcomed with an eager enthusiasm
                  that we cannot appreciate. For nothing but an actual experience of a dearth of
                  news, in a time when such interests were at stake, can give us an idea of the
                  relish that devoured the most meager accounts. Let us try to fancy ourselves in
                  their place, with the same hopes and fears. We have not forgotten our late war,
                  when a kindred feeling filled our hearts. How would our anxieties have multiplied,
                  if our means of obtaining information had been limited to the old-time
                  accommodations!</p>
               <p>Then no telegraph flashed the probable movements of the army across its wires. The
                  decisions of the councils of war, the engagements of actual fighting, the defeats,
                  or the victories won, were all "old news" by the time they reached the waiting
                  hearts in the soldiers' homes; and the most cheering intelligence was shadowed by
                  the dread that already some reverse had changed the aspect of affairs.</p>
               <p>There were no steam-cars hastening with the speed of the wind to bear supplies to
                  the camp; there were no sanitary associations to take charge of the sick and the
                  wounded; and no one had thought of using ether or chloroform to produce
                  insensibility to pain during surgical operations. War improved, and, as a
                     consequence<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6508-00000150"/> quence, abridged, is
                  almost a pastime compared with the old style of warfare.</p>
               <p>It was three weeks' painful travel, by the best accommodations known, from
                  Philadelphia, where the provincial Congress held its sessions, to Boston, where
                  the weary army awaited its directions. It was well that they could place an
                  absolute trust in the skill as well as the integrity of General Washington, for he
                  was often forced to important decisions without the possibility of communicating
                  with them.</p>
               <p>The munitions of war had little to boast of. Their killing ability was vastly
                  inferior to what science furnishes now. Explosive shells and long-range cannon
                  could not be transported on horseback, and it required almost herculean energy to
                  move the lighter cannon in use.</p>
               <p>The Americans had no navy. Later in the war the privateers did good service, but
                  at first the British commanded the sea. If only the little Monitor, which did such
                  service during the war of the Rebellion, had been in existence, they would have
                  needed no other force to clear the bays and harbors of the enemy. The mere sight
                  of the little black tower would have been enough. But we might fill a volume with
                  these comparisons of power without helping forward our story.</p>
               <p>On the evening of the 4th of March, General Washington ordered a brisk cannonade
                  to divert the attention of the enemy to another quarter, while General Thomas,
                  with a select body of troops, took possession, in silence, of Dorchester Heights.
                  His men were chosen as much for their mechanical skill as for their military
                  qualities, both being indispensable to success.</p>
               <p>The Yankee character for dispatch, that has always distinguished our countrymen,
                  was not lacking in the adventurous little band, for before morning they had
                  erected a long line of fortifications that commanded the harbor as well as the
                  town.</p>
               <p>General Howe had succeeded General Gage as commander-in-chief, and he was not
                  unlike that wise ruler in his contempt for any thing not English. That the
                  provincials were capable of any spirited enterprise never entered his mind. Their
                  opposition to the British rule was simply a contrary fit, too childish to excite
                  alarm, though heinous enough to merit punishment.</p>
               <p>When he got up in the morning, on the 5th of March, and saw, from his window,
                  those works which, like Jonah's gourd, had risen in a night, he thought himself
                  under the glamour of witchcraft. In the first place, his reason told him that a
                  work of such extent could not be accomplished in so short a period, and the
                  governor believed in reason.</p>
               <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6508-00000151"/>
               <p>He rubbed his eyes with a vague hope that a clearer view would dispel the
                  unwelcome vision, and prove it to be, at best, a mirage. But no rubbing altered
                  the prospect. The fortifications remained. Then he tried a spy-glass. With its aid
                  he could see the daring builders still hammering away to strengthen the weak
                  points. The glass dropped from his hands in his amazement. Without waiting for
                  breakfast, or for the proper adjustment of his magisterial wig, he hastily
                  summoned his officers to a council.</p>
               <p>It was evident that there was no time to lose, and but little to deliberate upon
                  the best course of action. A choice of measures was not permitted them, because it
                  was plain that unless they could drive the Americans from their new position they
                  must themselves evacuate the town. And to run away after holding Boston so long,
                  and crowing from its hills so loudly, would, as one of the officers remarked, "be
                  too ridiculous."</p>
               <p>Before noon three thousand men were embarked in boats, and proceeded by way of
                  Castle Island to attack the works on the heights. And now came one of those
                  interpositions of the elements which the Americans soon learned to regard as
                  providential. One of those driving easterly storms, that can be got up nowhere in
                  such perfection as on the New England shore, burst upon them and scattered the
                  boats in utter confusion. What would have been serious business for the patriot
                  troops was only play in its hands. No re-enforcement of men or arms would have
                  been half so effectual. With the greatest ease it dispersed the enemy, swamping
                  some of the boats, to show what it could do if provoked to extreme measures, and
                  driving the rest back with all speed into the harbor. By the time the storm was
                  over the works were too strong to be forced, and the English, to secure their own
                  safety, were obliged to depart from Boston at once. They embarked on the 17th of
                  March, taking many Tory families with them, to "the exceeding comfort of the
                  people left behind."</p>
               <p>The acquisition of Boston without bloodshed occasioned great rejoicings. Those who
                  had been so ready to decry the wisdom and loyalty of General Washington were now
                  the loudest in his praise. The thanks of Congress were voted to him and his
                  gallant troops, and a gold medal ordered to be struck to commemorate the event.
                  Whether particular thanks were offered for the opportune storm is not
                  recorded.</p>
               <p>Mark Woodward had been one of the fortunate number selected for the enterprise.
                  The deacon, much to his chagrin, was denied this sole chance to fight for his
                  country, and could<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6508-00000152"/> only watch the
                  course of events from afar. It was a great trial to this good man that he was to
                  return home without once being under fire. Not that he was especially desirous to
                  kill some-body, but he was overflowing with zeal and wanted to show it.</p>
               <p>His winter in the camp had not been without service. The sick and the desponding
                  could attest that. His cordial voice and hearty cheerfulness came like sunshine to
                  the hard cots where the brave sufferers were battling with disease, and no other
                  man in the army was so often sent for to pray by the side of the dying. Indeed, so
                  useful and popular had he become that he would doubtless have been retained in the
                  service had not a rheumatic affection in his right knee made him slightly lame,
                  and so unable to bear the long, forced marches in prospect across the country, or
                  the increased privations of temporary camps.</p>
               <p>The army did not linger long after the departure of the British. A small camp
                  remained in Roxbury, but the main body hastened by divisions to New York, and
                  during the years of war that followed, Boston and its vicinity were spared an
                  actual participation in its horrors.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the peaceful nature of his services, the deacon was received at
                  home as one risen from the dead. All through the six months of his absence there
                  had been no time when a bloody conflict had not been apprehended; no time when the
                  anxious hearts at home had not dreaded the coming of bad tidings.</p>
               <p>As for him, he felt almost like a deserter, and looked with genuine contempt upon
                  the slight lameness that had occasioned his return. "There was never a time when
                  the country needed men more," he remarked, discontentedly, after grimly listening
                  to the rejoicings over his safe return. "Many of the soldiers would not re-enlist
                  on any terms. They expected the British would make peace as soon as we should
                  fight, as they would have done if they had an atom of sense. A long campaign is a
                  different affair. If the ranks keep thinning out, they may be glad yet of such
                  help as mine."</p>
               <p>"The war will be over," said Mistress Bowen, smiling brightly, "when we depend on
                  the lame to do the fighting. It is very considerate, I am sure, to let the strong
                  young men go first."</p>
               <p>"Just the way Mark talked. He seemed really glad that I was to come home. 'You
                  take care of Aunty Bowen and Hetty,' said he, 'and I'll do the fighting.'"</p>
               <p>"I'm sure, father, that was sensible."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps."</p>
               <pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6508-00000153"/>
               <p>"Mark is always sensible," spoke up Hetty, who had been listening quietly.</p>
               <p>"Is he? I must tell you about a talk I had with him the night afore he started for
                  New York. You needn't color up so, Miss Hetty. We were not talking about you.
                  There are a few other subjects in the world," said the deacon, laughing
                  significantly at the young girl's pretty embarrassment.</p>
               <p>"Don't tease her, father," interposed Mistress Bowen, kindly. "Tell us about that
                  last night with Mark."</p>
               <p>"Wal, it was nothing great; but I've thought of it abundance of times since, and
                  wondered why studying books need to make fools of men. I thought he might have
                  some <emph>particular</emph> word to send home by me, and so I hunted him up. He
                  was standing just outside the tent a-looking up to the stars, as if he had just
                  found out that there was any. Wal, I must say they did actilly shine as if they'd
                  just been rubbed up new with chalk. The air was just as clear as crystal, and the
                  sky looked as blue as spring vi'lets. 'Mark,' says I, 'now this is an uncommon
                  fine night. Real inspiring.' He answered by repeating that Scriptur' verse: 'The
                  heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.' 'That
                  expresses it exactly,' said I. Fact is, I'd been thinking of that very verse."</p>
               <p>"'Uncle Bowen,' said he, 'when I look at those countless worlds, among which our
                  earth seems a mere atom, I feel as if we and our plans were of small account. This
                  war, and its possible results, seems too insignificant to fill our thoughts and
                  absorb our whole being as it does. After all, we are just a race of pigmies
                  creeping about in a by-corner of God's universe. Look at that white star in the
                  north'—he called it Cafrilla, or some such outlandish name."</p>
               <p>"The Capella," corrected Hetty, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Indeed! And how came you to know so much, pussy?"</p>
               <p>"Mark used to tell me about the stars when we were out walking in the evening. I
                  know lots of them by name. That white one I picked out for mine, and Mark chose
                  one in the south. Its name is Sirius, and it is near Orion, a constellation of
                  stars mentioned in Job," said Hetty, quite proud of her bits of astronomical
                  learning.</p>
               <p>"Bless my soul! What knowledge! Don't it make you head ache? Do you know any
                  more?"</p>
               <p>"Not much," she answered, humbly, for the prejudice against female education so
                  pervaded all grades of society that Hetty's pride was snubbed at once by her
                  father's raillery.</p>
               <p>"I'm glad of it. Stick to the spinning-wheel<pb n="308-309"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000154"/> and dairy, and read your Bible every day, and
                  you'll come out all right. I listened to Mark just as long as I could stand it,"
                  the deacon continued, turning to his wife, "for his talk sounded real
                  heathenish."</p>
               <p>Hetty's cherry lips pouted indignantly at this, but her father did not see them.
                  She respected her father, but "Mark knows," her heart kept repeating to itself as
                  she listened.</p>
               <p>"I said to him, 'Now, Mark, you pass for a sensible fellow, and you were one afore
                  you read so many of Parson Smith's books. Let me just argue one of these p'ints a
                  little. We'll suppose it's all true about those stars up there being worlds—which
                  I don't believe, and never shall; and we'll 'low that they're as awful big as you
                  say—which is all guess-work; still, there's considerable to respect in the old
                  earth yet. The great God who created the whole parcel of them made man in his own
                  image, which is something of an honor, according to my way of thinking. More than
                  that, he gave his only Son to die for man's salvation, and that Son came down from
                  heaven, and lived and died upon this earth, which you think is off in a corner,
                  and too powerful small to be noticed. Now, if the earth and its inhabitants are of
                  such importance in the view of the Creator, I don't think we need turn up our
                  noses at it."</p>
               <p>"What did Mark say?" In Mistress Bowen's opinion the deacon was as wise as any
                  body in the world, always excepting Parson Smith.</p>
               <p>"He smiled in his pleasant way, that always gives me a queer feeling in arguing
                  with him, as if he might be right after all, and then he said: 'I believe in God's
                  particular care of us as strongly as you do. I like to think that not a sparrow
                  falls to the ground without his notice. But even the Psalmist was awed into
                  humility by contemplating the heavens on a night like this. You remember his
                  words: "When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the
                  stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and
                  the son of man, that thou visitest him?" I only share his feeling, Uncle Bowen.' I
                  told him that there were a variety of other things that David ought to have felt
                  humble about; that he said and did things that I couldn't fellowship, no how."</p>
               <p>"Which had the best of the argument, finally?"</p>
               <p>"Wal," said the deacon, "it was like most other arguments, it left us both where
                  it found us. Hetty, I must not forget Mark's message while we are on this subject.
                  'Tell her,' he said, 'that I shall look for her star every night<pb n="310-311"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000155"/> from camp, because it will be looking toward home.'
                  I suppose you will do as much by his star, so there will be a couple of silly
                  star-gazers. Eh! Hetty."</p>
               <p>The color had been deepening in the young girl's cheeks, and they flushed into
                  scarlet now under her father's meaning look. She did not answer, but made an
                  errand out of the room as speedily as possible. The deacon laughed heartily.</p>
               <p>"Now, father," remonstrated Mistress Bowen, "you must stop joking her about Mark.
                  I don't want her head running on courtship and marriage yet awhile."</p>
               <p>"Why not? I told Mark he had your consent and mine, and when he was at home he
                  asked hers."</p>
               <p>"Why, father!" Mistress Bowen was paring some turnips for the dinner-pot, and she
                  dropped the basket on the floor in her surprise.</p>
               <p>"So Hetty did not tell you?"</p>
               <p>"I should think not. A child like that! Do you know how young she is?"</p>
               <p>"I know how old her mother was when I went a huckleberrying with her one day away
                  over in the Hingham woods. And I shall never forget a sartain pear-tree where we
                  sat down to rest, and where I asked her to—"</p>
               <p>The deacon did not finish his sentence, for, glancing slyly round to note the
                  effect of his words, he found that he had the room to himself.</p>
               <p>He was soon gratified by finding that his home-coming was a matter of kindly
                  interest all over the town. The families near by vied with each other in their
                  friendly attentions. One neighbor offered to help about the spring planting.
                  Another begged to replenish the wood-pile, which had dwindled to very moderate
                  proportions during the winter. For Fuss, though a capital hand at outwitting
                  Tories and taking care of cattle, was quite incapable of carrying on, without
                  direction, the necessary work of the farm. Indeed, regular work of any kind did
                  not agree with him. He liked fishing, and training dogs, and hunting. For this
                  last pursuit he had a decided talent, never returning empty-handed from a shooting
                  excursion.</p>
               <p>Both he and his wife began to exhibit a desire to return to their old,
                  irresponsible life in the cabin by the shore, as soon as the deacon's presence at
                  home gave the family a protector. They had passed through the winter far more
                  comfortably than would have been possible at home, with their uncertain ways of
                  obtaining a subsistence, but they had missed that charming sense of independence
                  which is quite as delightful to the negro as to the white man. So it was<pb
                     n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6508-00000156"/> soon settled that they should go back;
                  Fuss agreeing to come over for occasional service for a day at a time when
                  particularly needed.</p>
               <p>"Shall be glad to 'commodate at any time," he said soberly, as if his only object
                  in working was to bestow a kindness. "If you get pushed hard, just let me
                  know."</p>
               <p>Nowhere did the deacon's presence produce a more agreeable sensation than in the
                  singing-gallery of the meeting-house when he resumed his old place as the leader
                  of the choir. The singers had grown very restive under the leadership of Joe
                  Humphreys, and nothing but the prospect of the deacon's speedy return had kept
                  them quiet.</p>
               <p>Joe, with that pleasant self-conceit peculiar to little minds, had persuaded
                  himself that he was a popular chorister, and that the choir would be as reluctant
                  as himself to see the deacon in his place.</p>
               <p>"Guess he'll find out plaguey quick that he aint a-going to rule any longer in the
                  choir," he said, exultingly, to that indulgent listener, his mother. "He's old
                  enough to sit down stairs in his pew. If he don't go down I shall, and we'll see
                  how many will stick by him then."</p>
               <p>So, on Sunday, when the deacon composedly took his old seat, Joe took his hat and
                  marched down stairs with a pompous air that was exceedingly ingly ludicrous. He
                  confidently expected that a majority of the singers would follow his example. But
                  when he arrived at the bottom of the stairs, and, after waiting a reasonable time,
                  found that he was alone in his demonstration of wrath, the question put on a new
                  aspect. He was too politic to sit below and provoke the comments of the
                  congregation, which, he strongly suspected, might be on the deacon's side. His
                  crestfallen look as he wheeled round and went back to his old place among the
                  tenor singers was so ridiculously in contrast with his previous appearance, that
                  an involuntary smile all along the line greeted him.</p>
               <p>"Thought you were off in a huff, Joe," whispered a young fellow, maliciously.</p>
               <p>"Much you know about it," returned Joe, crossly. "I went down after a book I left
                  in the entry."</p>
               <p>"Couldn't find it, could you?" Joe had brought no book back with him. It was a
                  very transparent lie that he had told.</p>
               <p>"None of your business if I couldn't."</p>
               <p>"Don't be so grouty, Joe. We aint to blame if the deacon wasn't killed in
                  battle."</p>
               <p>"Guess I'm as glad to see him back as any of you. 'Taint no easy matter to run
                  this old singing consarn, I tell ye. I'm thankful to give it up."</p>
               <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6508-00000157"/>
               <p>"But what sent you off so glum just now. My! Didn't you step high? Did you hear
                  the girls giggle?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing new if they did. Such empty heads laugh at nothing."</p>
               <p>Nannie White sat directly in front of him, near enough to enjoy the dialogue. She
                  turned round with her blue eyes dancing with merriment.</p>
               <p>"That is it exactly, Joe. We were laughing at 'nothing.' You couldn't describe
                  yourself better if you tried a week."</p>
               <p>The deacon shook his head at the lively girl, but there was a twinkle in his eyes
                  that showed his enjoyment of the spicy little colloquy behind him. Parson Smith's
                  appearance in the pulpit silenced all, and, seemingly forgetful of earthly
                  interests and rivalries, the whole congregation stood up reverently during the
                  invocation that began the service.</p>
               <p>It would be a curious sight if we could reproduce the scene in the meeting-house
                  yard after the meeting. Very many of the audience had come from a distance of five
                  and six miles—the most of them, indeed, living too far away to think of walking.
                  Such conveniences as wheeled carriages were scarcely known—the doctor's "shay"
                  being the only vehicle that deserved the name of carriage. The stout farmers came
                  on horseback, with their rosy wives or daughters snugly tucked up behind them on a
                  pillion, unless they had horses enough to do away with the necessity of riding
                  double. A huge horse-block stood at either end of the meeting-house steps, and the
                  young men stood bashfully near to assist the fair damsels to mount, or to swell
                  with envy when some more fortunate swain, with quicker eye and step, secured the
                  sweet privilege. And when, at last, the cavalcade, with its motley show of homely
                  contrivances and fresh beauty, moved slowly down the hill, it was a living picture
                  worth seeing. It will never be seen again, and there are few now living who have
                  heard it described by those who then witnessed it.</p>
               <p>Ever since the organization of the Church in Weymouth, there had been a weekly
                  gathering of its most devout members for conference and prayer. The attendance was
                  not restricted to Church members, yet it was not attractive enough to draw in the
                  careless young people or the elderly worldling. That weekly meeting has been
                  continued down to our time, varying in its interest according to the manifestation
                  of spiritual life in the persons conducting it. In the deacon's time, the
                  exercises had a set formality and prosiness that rendered them intolerably dull to
                  "outsiders." Hetty often declared<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6508-00000158"/> that
                  she knew every word of the prayers and solemn "talks" by heart.</p>
               <p>Into one of these meetings came Deacon Bowen, fresh from his experiences of camp
                  life, and wholly unconscious that in the straits that had brought him sensibly
                  near to God, he had got out of the prim half-bushel in which he had trotted all
                  his life. When Parson Smith invited him to make a few remarks, he rose eagerly,
                  and without a single allusion to the doctrines of grace, began to relate his own
                  experience of God's love, and the wonderful exhibitions of his power to save from
                  sin that he had seen among the sick and the dying.</p>
               <p>"O brethren!" he said, "this religion is wonderful—wonderful! It just takes a man
                  out of the mire and sorrow of sin, and plants his feet upon a rock, with a new
                  song in his mouth and the promise of future glory in his heart. It's worth every
                  thing."</p>
               <p>How that staid company of elders stared! Some felt their hearts strangely warmed
                  while they listened. They recognized the genuineness of the experience set forth
                  with such direct simplicity. Others shook their wise heads doubtfully. All waited
                  expectantly to hear how the deacon would pray. As if Parson Smith shared their
                  curiosity, he called on him at once. There was no hesitancy in the deacon's manner
                  as he rose and reverently closed his eyes and folded his hands.</p>
               <p>But, instead of beginning his prayer with a formal introduction full of
                  information to the Almighty in regard to his own attributes and perfections, he
                  startled his hearers by coming directly to the expression of their need as
                  sinners.</p>
               <p>He prayed, "Father, we are weak; be thou our help. We are erring; be thou our
                  wisdom. We are sinful, going astray continually; be thou our salvation. We are
                  needy, and thy bountiful hand is full of blessings. Thou givest us food and
                  raiment, home and friends, but over and above all, O Father! we need
                     <emph>thee.</emph> And because that thou, in thy infinite pity for us, didst
                  give thine only Son to bear the just penalty of our sins in our stead, and so open
                  a way of access to thee, we come with boldness to the throne of grace, and through
                  Jesus, the Christ, offer up our thanksgivings and supplications."</p>
               <p>It was certainly a new style of prayer for the place. This coming at once to the
                  mercy-seat, and without question or doubt appropriating the freely offered grace
                  of the Gospel, was a new feature altogether. It sent a warm glow into the hearts
                  that were half-unconsciously hungering after a closer walk with God.</p>
               <p>But old Deacon Holbrook felt that he had a duty to do. As soon as the meeting was
                     dismissed<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6508-00000159"/> missed he offered to walk
                  home with his brother deacon, and they had hardly left the school-house, where the
                  meetings were held, before he proceeded to open his mind.</p>
               <p>"I am a good deal older than you are, and I have seen a good deal of religious
                  folks, but I must say I never before heard a Christian talk with so much
                  confidence unless he were dying and had dying grace. Why, you prayed," said Deacon
                  Holbrook, shaking his head solemnly, "as if you were talking to the Almighty face
                  to face."</p>
               <p>"And is not prayer a communing with the Most High?" asked Deacon Bowen, quite
                  astonished to hear his humble petition thus criticised.</p>
               <p>"Why, yes. But we should come into his presence with reverence."</p>
               <p>"And with thanksgiving, too, my Bible says. There is surely no irreverence in
                  coming to him in the way that he has himself ordained. Why shouldn't we come with
                  confidence?"</p>
               <p>"With humble hope, brother, not with a vain-glorious presumption."</p>
               <p>"It is not presumption to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. God offers us mercy,
                  but he don't mean that we are to hang back and hesitate, and doubt whether or no
                  he is in earnest and really means it, before we bring ourselves to believe in his
                  sincerity and accept it. According to my way of thinking, there is no irreverence
                  in taking God at his word."</p>
               <p>"And do you pretend to <emph>know</emph> that you are a child of grace?"</p>
               <p>"I know that I most thankfully seek and accept the offered salvation. I just rest
                  on the promises, and I feel an abiding peace. The everlasting arms are around me,
                  and nothing can separate me from the love of Christ."</p>
               <p>"Wal, I must say I never heard a Christian go on like this in all my life. I am
                  astonished, Deacon Bowen. You are on dangerous ground. Next thing, you will
                  believe that a Christian can fall from grace."</p>
               <p>"Deacon Holbrook, if Paul, whose miraculous conversion couldn't be doubted, begged
                  the prayers of his brethren, lest, having preached the Gospel to others, he
                  himself should be a castaway, I think it possible that believers of our stamp may
                  be in danger. Anyhow, the Bible is full of warning on that p'int, which wouldn't
                  be the case if backsliding weren't possible. 'Let him that thinketh he standeth
                  take heed lest he fall.'"</p>
               <p>"Ah! wal, wal! I dunno. My path turns off here. Good-night."</p>
               <p>"It is a cur'ous affair," said Deacon Bowen to himself as he walked on alone, "if
                     Deacon<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6508-00000160"/> Holbrook has belonged to the
                  Church forty years and never found these things in the Bible. Why, they are as
                  plain as A B C."</p>
               <p>It was more curious still, if he had thought of it, how he himself contrived to
                  harmonize these lively truths with the opposite doctrine of predestination.</p>

               <head type="sub">A NEW COMER.</head>
               <p>AFTER all, it was very pleasant to be at home. If the good deacon could only have
                  shown one scar in proof of the valorous patriotism that had caused his temporary
                  absence he would have settled down contented.</p>
               <p>It was pleasant to see the loved home-faces about him, and to sit in the evening,
                  the center of an interested group of old neighbors, and recount the incidents of
                  the camp. Then it seemed to him that he must have been blind all his life never to
                  have found out before that no corner of the world could begin to compete in
                  natural charms with the sunny hills and dells of his native town. He had always
                  known that the low studded farm-house where he was born was the pleasantest
                  dwelling on the face of the earth. And where could any thing be found in the
                  heavens above or the earth beneath like the wall-paper on the keeping-room? It was
                  of all colors, most of them profusely laid on, picturing a long and gay cavalcade,
                  with the riders in all varieties of costume, and the blue and orange horses

                  When he was a little shaver he used to lie on the floor, and study that impossible
                  equestrian performance with unspeakable admiration, and his boyhood came back
                  whenever his eye rested on it now. Ah! it was the delicious
                     <emph>home-feeling</emph> that threw its soft glamour over the most common
                  objects, and tinted and glorified every corner of the farm.</p>
               <p>The very gooseberry-bushes, straggling in unkempt luxuriance at the head of the
                  garden, had a companionable look. The spring daffodils under the south window were
                  planted by his mother, but had they ever before put on such rare bloom? Did the
                  swelling buds in the maple woods ever before seem such a grove of delicate
                  flowers? Strange that he had never felt the subtle charm of the violets on the
                  bank by the spring, or the hepaticas and anemones along the wood paths.</p>
               <p>It was plain that the deacon's spiritual nature had been expanding. In more senses
                  than one he had got out of his half bushel. Out of his religious growth sprang
                  this new sense of the beautiful in God's creation, for in reality nothing was
                  changed. Nature always sets her palette in the same way; her artistic taste never
                  alters.</p>
               <p>It is marvelous that those who till the soil, and spend their lives in the
                  unspoiled sanctuaries of God, are so often insensible to the wonderful changes
                  around them.</p>
               <p>A young girl whose laborious life had been nearly all spent in the stifling
                  atmosphere of a cotton-mill, spent a week in autumn on a farm. So much loveliness
                  met her unaccustomed eyes that she could scarcely eat or sleep. The kind-hearted
                  people watched her curiously, quite unable to understand her transports.</p>
               <p>One morning she came in from an early ramble with her hands full of late flowers.
                  There were blue lobelias, and fringed gentians, and delicate touch-me-nots, in
                  beautiful contrast with the rose-scarlet leaves of the hacmatack. "Look!" she
                  said. "Was there ever any thing more lovely?"</p>
               <p>The farmer's wife smiled kindly at the eager face that had caught a little healthy
                  bloom from her out-door walk.</p>
               <p>"That," she said, pointing to the hacmatack, "that is a master-cure for summer
                  complaint."</p>
               <p>Just before sunset the young girl's enthusiasm burst forth again. Across the way
                  stood a magnificent ash with its green leaves partly turned to gold, and gleaming
                  in the western light like an illuminated temple of sunbeams.</p>
               <p>"Do you see it?" she said. "That wonderful tree? It is beautiful enough for
                  paradise. It might shade the homes of the angels."</p>
               <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6508-00000162"/>
               <p>"Is it that old ash that you are looking at? Why, it's been there for ages. The
                  leaves and bark are good for dye-stuff. Stephen talks of cutting it down, it
                  shades the corn so."</p>
               <p>In the deacon's time, poetry kept itself well in the background. Very likely there
                  was more of it than showed upon the surface. No one troubled themselves to give a
                  name to the delicious feeling that stirred the inner man with the first signs of
                  life in spring, or to the pleasing sadness that the brilliant but decaying
                  coloring of autumn must have inspired.</p>
               <p>A practical question began to disturb the deacon. He had been used to the ready
                  and intelligent assistance of Mark about the farm-work, and, in addition, had
                  hired from two to three extra hands during the planting and haying seasons. Both
                  the hired men and Mark were in the army, and the deacon could not think of a
                  single person that he could be likely to engage. The neighbors were profuse in
                  their offers of help, but they had enough to do for themselves. Hetty and her
                  mother could give him an hour now and then, but, generally, their hands were full
                  in the house. So the question kept coming up, "Where on earth can I hire a man to
                  work during the summer?"</p>
               <p>The answer to the question was nearer than he thought. He was sitting moodily by
                  the fire one chilly evening, when a loud rapping at the front door startled them
                  all, for the neighbors walked familiarly into each other's houses without the
                  ceremony of knocking.</p>
               <p>"The massy!" said Mistress Bowen, dropping half a dozen stitches in her knitting
                  as she started up, "who's come now?"</p>
               <p>As the easiest way to answer her inquiry, she hurried to open the door. It was a
                  dark night, and at first she could see nothing, but a voice somewhere out of the
                  depths asked:—</p>
               <p>"Does William Bowen live here?"</p>
               <p>Mistress Bowen always called her husband "father," and every body else said "the
                  deacon," so for a minute the good dame hesitated while she recalled his name.</p>
               <p>"That's my name," called her husband from the kitchen. "Tell him to walk in."</p>
               <p>In response to this invitation, the visitor came forward into the light and
                  followed Mistress Bowen into the house. She had left the door of the kitchen open,
                  and the cheery glow of the fire shone out into the entry.</p>
               <p>"Tell ye what!" said the new comer, going straight up to the deacon and shaking
                  hands with him vigorously, "It seems the most like living here of any place I've
                  seen this side of Newport."</p>
               <p>"Are you from Newport?"</p>
               <pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6508-00000163"/>
               <p>"Aint from nowhere else. I've brought a letter for you from my mother."</p>
               <p>"Your mother?" The deacon looked puzzled.</p>
               <p>"There! It's just as I told her. I knew you'd forgotten her ages ago. She said I
                  had only to say I was the son of Huldah—"</p>
               <p>"Huldah Vining," interrupted the deacon. "You don't say so. Sit down, my boy, sit
                  down. Hetty, this is your cousin. Come and shake hands with him."</p>
               <p>Hetty readily came forward to join in welcoming him, her bright eyes shining with
                  interested girlish curiosity.</p>
               <p>"I did not know I had any cousins in Rhode Island," she said simply, "but I am
                  glad to see you."</p>
               <p>"His mother is my first cousin," said her father. "It is thirty years since she
                  went out to Rhode Island with Aunt Polly Graves, who came here on a visit. Came
                  all the way from Providence alone, on horseback. There's grit for ye. Let me see.
                  Huldah soon married a Quaker, didn't she? and went to live at Newport? I can't
                  justly remember his name now."</p>
               <p>"It is Curtis, Joseph Curtis. And my name is Robert."</p>
               <p>"A Quaker, too, I suppose. Eh?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I belong to the meeting; that is, I was born into the connection somehow,
                  but I aint much of any thing, myself. Never was. So mother says. Very likely she
                  has written it in that letter. Here it is."</p>
               <p>Robert had been fumbling in his pockets while giving this comprehensive
                  description of his religious state, and now produced a thick, square letter, large
                  enough for a Government document.</p>
               <p>"I see you don't 'thee and thou' it in talking," said the deacon, smiling.</p>
               <p>"At home I use the plain language, and I like it. But what would be the use of it
                  here?"</p>
               <p>"Now, mother, you just get him a bite of something to eat, and I'll run over this
                  letter. Thirty years ago. Why, Huldah was about the age of our Hetty here. She
                  used to be here half the time, for her parents were both dead. We used to sit on
                  this very settle and parch corn and roast apples in the fire. She was a leetle
                  high-strung," looking attentively into the boyish face before him to judge if he
                  had inherited this quality, "and we used to quarrel like blazes."</p>
               <p>While the deacon reads his letter and Robert eats his supper, we will look at him
                  too. He was apparently about eighteen or nineteen years old, though he proved to
                  be a couple of years older. His figure was slim and tall; the loosely-hanging arms
                  giving no idea of their real<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6508-00000164"/> strength.
                  He had a freckled, good-natured face, crowned with a great shock of coarse red
                  hair, that looked as if it had not been combed out for a year. It was difficult to
                  determine the color of his eyes until one was well acquainted with their owner.
                  They seemed capable of any variety of color or expression.</p>
               <p>In his Quaker home at Newport, Robert had been from his earliest days the cause of
                  great anxiety. He was an odd one in a flock of ten children. The rest were born
                  Friends in every sense. They were grave, quiet children, falling naturally into
                  the prim, staid ways of the household, and growing to maturity as steady as a set
                  of sheep. Each one was content to abide securely in the shadow of home, and to
                  keep steadfastly to the "meeting," eschewing the simple vanities of dress, and the
                  gay diversions of the worldly-minded. They grew rich, of course, for it is as
                  natural for Quakers to make money as it is to breathe.</p>
               <p>Robert had scarcely a feeling in common with his brothers and sisters. All the
                  roguery and mischief of the family seemed to be embodied in him. The father sighed
                  drearily over the outbreakings of the carnal mind in his son; the mother,
                  remembering her own early freaks, said nothing.</p>
               <p>From the day that he could trot about on the floor in his short frocks, the boy
                  had shown a peculiarly restless, roving temper. Even in his sleep, the unsettled
                  spirit exhibited itself in kicks and sudden thrusts of the hands most unseemly for
                  the occupant of a Quaker cradle.</p>
               <p>Before he was eight years old he had twice been brought home from the hold of
                  ships where he had bestowed himself among the cargo with the delusive hope of
                  voyaging to distant lands. At sixteen he had explored every part of the beautiful
                  little island of which Newport was the capital, even to the high crannies in the
                  cliffs along the shore. It was a delightful region, he did not pretend to deny
                  that, but there was too little of it. "Nothing but the same old story," he
                  remarked, discontentedly.</p>
               <p>When the war began he had a strong desire to enlist as a soldier, not from
                  patriotic feeling, for he had not troubled himself with political questions, but
                  it would be a good chance to see the world.</p>
               <p>"It would be a change, at least," he said to his mother. "Any thing is better than
                  a dead calm."</p>
               <p>To prevent so horrible a catastrophe as a born Quaker taking up arms to slay his
                  fellow-man, Robert's parents set their wits to work to devise some change for him.
                  As a compromise between his inclination and theirs, they consented<pb n="330-331"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000165"/> sented to his leaving home for a visit to his
                  mother's native town, with this condition, that he should find some steady work
                  and stay there till the close of the war, which, of course, would come to an end
                  by the next autumn.</p>
               <p>All this the deacon learned from the letter, which he read with deliberate
                  attention, pausing over the descriptions of character, and regarding his guest
                  over the top of his spectacles as if he were fitting him with a suit of mental
                  attire.</p>
               <p>"Wal, really now," he said at last, "there seems to be a partick'ler providence in
                  this. Here am I, over head and ears in work that must be done now or never, and no
                  living soul in all the town to be hired for love or money. Now, right in the
                  middle of the muss, you come to hire out, you needing me and I needing you.
                  Needn't tell me that things aint ordered for us up above. All we need is patience
                  to wait for them to work round. S'pose you had as lief hire out to me as any body.
                  Eh?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. It will seem more like home here, because mother has told me so much about
                  the place. I feel as if I knew every corner of it now."</p>
               <p>"What can you do? Been used to farm work to home?"</p>
               <p>"O! I can do most any thing. Drop corn, hoe potatoes, mow, build fence, catch
                  wood-chucks—any thing you want," Robert answered soberly, with an evident faith in
                  his own ability.</p>
               <p>"Wal, I guess we sha'n't disagree. I'll try you a week or two and then we'll make
                  a bargain. This is Thursday. We wont begin with a broken week. You'll want to look
                  about a little and take the bearings of the place. Besides, you will need rest
                  after your journey. By the way," asked the deacon, with sudden curiosity, "how did
                  you get here?"</p>
               <p>"Walked all the way from Providence. Didn't hurry myself. Started a week ago. Took
                  time to look about a little on the way. It's a lonesome road, to make the best
                  on't."</p>
               <p>"Wal, I'm glad you came, and hope you'll like us now you are here."</p>
               <p>"There is no doubt about that," said Robert, looking up earnestly, not into the
                  deacon's face, but into the fair face of his young cousin, who stood smiling
                  brightly over the happy termination of her father's difficulties. Mistress Bowen
                  shook her head doubtfully as she noted the undisguised admiration of his gaze. But
                  there was something in his honest, homely features that won her good-will and
                  kindly interest, and she was not in the least inclined to resent his involuntary
                  tribute to Hetty's beauty.</p>
               <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6508-00000166"/>
               <p>"I guess I'll hunt up my bundle," said Robert, presently. "I left it out by the
                  gate, for I wasn't sure of this being the right place. Not much in it, only my
                  shirts and stockings, and my Sunday rig."</p>
               <p>Hetty's eyes had curiously marked the quaint cut of his clothes, and wondered
                  where the Quakers found such strange patterns. She said nothing; but when the
                  bundle was brought in, and Robert proceeded to open it, she pushed herself close
                  to the table to inspect its contents. Not a very polite action, but Robert did not
                  mind it.</p>
               <p>"I know what you are after," he said, laughing, "and I don't blame you a mite. But
                  you needn't be scared. I had these clothes made on purpose to wear here. Father
                  didn't like the notion at all; he said the Friends had no reason to be ashamed of
                  their plain dress, and it was meeting the old adversary mor'n half way to follow
                  the fashions of the world. But I was determined not to have all Weymouth a-gaping
                  at me every time I sat in your pew. Not that I cared much about it for myself, but
                  I thought you would."</p>
               <p>"I dunno," the deacon began.</p>
               <p>"Well, I do," responded Hetty. "I'm real glad your clothes are not odd. They're
                  nice, too," holding up the coat for her mother to see.</p>
               <p>"Well, they're not so bad as to the stuff. The Friends go in strong for good
                  material. I had them made by Betsey Lovel, as good a tailoress as any in Newport.
                  Glad you like them. And I'm glad the old bundle is here at last. Don't want to lug
                  it another inch."</p>
               <p>Robert was domesticated in the family at once, and a very desirable addition he
                  made to it. He was so full of life and so original withal, that it was impossible
                  to think of dullness or monotony in his presence.</p>
               <p>To Hetty he was invaluable, entering into all her plans and interests with as much
                  zeal as if they were his own. Every corner of the farm, and a good deal of the
                  surrounding region, was familiar to him in less than twenty-four hours, and Friday
                  evening found him sitting by Hetty in the wide window-seat listening with rapt
                  attention to her account of the incidents that had occurred before his coming.
                  Especially did he enjoy her description of Joe Humphreys, and the history of his
                  unsuccessful attempts to annoy them. He laughed till the tears rolled down his
                  cheeks as his lively imagination set off the picture of Joe's scalding and his
                  comical imprisonment in the barn. He understood his spite toward Mark without. a
                  word of explanation.</p>
               <p>"How I wish I had been here!" he exclaimed. "I am sure I could have helped you
                  some how.<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6508-00000167"/> Is this—this Mark Woodward,"
                  he hesitated a little, "is he any relation?"</p>
               <p>"No. He was brought up here, and was the same as a brother to me till lately."</p>
               <p>"And now?"</p>
               <p>"Well," said Hetty, frankly, though the roses on her cheek grew brighter in the
                  candle-light, "I don't mind telling you that I shall be his wife when the war is
                  over if he lives to come home. I shall have to take you for my brother now."</p>
               <p>"Agreed." There was just a shade of disappointment in his tone. "I'll tell you
                  what I am going to do. I'm going to get back Mark's clock. You say that scamp has
                  it."</p>
               <p>"O, Robert! do you think it can possibly be done?" Hetty's eyes had a sparkle in
                  them now that was perfectly dazzling.</p>
               <p>"It can be tried. And I am going to do it. It must be before he sees me or knows
                  that I am here. Don't say a word to the old folks, Hetty. Is the clock heavy?"</p>
               <p>"No. It has no case to speak of."</p>
               <p>"Not very valuable?"</p>
               <p>"I suppose not. Aunt Hannah thought it was something wonderful. She used to tell
                  Mark and me long stories about the folks who had owned it in England. Mark used to
                  take it to pieces and clean it for her, and please her by praising the brass works
                  inside. He would value it for her sake if it were not worth a pin. Joe only values
                  it as a means of spiting us."</p>
               <p>"You say he likes money?"</p>
               <p>"He's the stingiest mortal that ever lived," answered Hetty, promptly.</p>
               <p>"We'll 'tend to his case to-morrow. See if we don't."</p>
               <p>"What are you laughing at, children?" said the deacon, laying down his newspaper,
                  and turning round to look at them.</p>
               <p>"Nothing in particular."</p>
               <p>"Nothing? Ah! wal, wal! Young folks must giggle, or they wouldn't be young
                  folks."</p>

               <head type="sub">A BARGAIN.</head>
               <p>"NOW," said Robert, coming into the dairy where Hetty was busy with the butter, "I
                  want you to tell me first of all how Joe Humphreys looks. Your mother is feeding
                  the hens. I can see her if she comes toward the house."</p>
               <p>"He is a little white-livered chap with yellow hair. Has a wart on the side of his
                  nose."</p>
               <p>"Which side? East or west?"</p>
               <p>"Don't make me laugh, Robert. He wears light-brown trowsers about home, and a blue
                  frock. You can't help knowing him. He has a sneaking look, as if he had just
                  cheated somebody."</p>
               <p>"Now about the way."</p>
               <p>"Yes. You know that red house down below the hill where you went with father,
                  yesterday?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Well, he don't live there."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!"</p>
               <p>"Farther up the road you will come to a long, low house, all length and no height.
                  That is the place. Close to the road is a small building painted green. It used to
                  be a store for West India goods. You will see 'Rum, Sugar, Gin, Allspice, and
                  Ginger' printed on the black window-shutters. It is a sort of cooper's shop now,
                  and Joe pretends to work there. He may be there this morning, though all the work
                  he does wouldn't tire a flea."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'm off. Don't look for me till you see me. Here comes Aunt Bowen.
                  Goodbye."</p>
               <p>"I wonder where Robert is posting to now," said Mistress Bowen as she came in. "I
                  think he must have ransacked the whole place yesterday. I never saw such a
                  restless fellow. He can't keep still a minute."</p>
               <p>"O mother dear! what a lot of eggs you have brought in! The hens are laying in
                  good earnest."</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed. Bring a basket for these in my apron and I will count them,"
                  answered her mother, quite unsuspicious that Hetty was seeking to divert her
                  thoughts from any farther speculations about Robert.</p>
               <p>The young girl grew decidedly nervous as the morning wore away. She moved about
                  her work fitfully and excitedly, neglecting so many of the important details that
                  her mother's attention was soon attracted.</p>
               <pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6508-00000169"/>
               <p>"Hetty, child, do you know that you have not skimmed all the milk? There are three
                  pans left on the shelf behind the door."</p>
               <p>"Are there? I will skim them now."</p>
               <p>"Hetty," a little later, "why have you left the blankets off in making Robert's
                  bed?"</p>
               <p>"Did I? I must have forgotten them. I will go and put them on."</p>
               <p>"Hetty," still later, "I have seen you salt that Indian pudding two or three
                  times. Let me taste it before you put in the molasses. Why, child, it is as salt
                  as Lot's wife!"</p>
               <p>"Is it?" said Hetty, absently.</p>
               <p>"Taste it yourself. It is just spoiled. You will have to throw it into the
                  swill-pail and begin again. Dear me! The work is all behindhand. And Saturday
                  never seems more than half a day."</p>
               <p>Hetty stood still, as if she did not half understand. "If you've lost your senses,
                  child," said her mother, impatiently, "you may as well sit down in the corner and
                  fold your hands. You hinder more than you help me."</p>
               <p>It was such a rare thing for her mother to scold that Hetty's attention was
                  thoroughly aroused.</p>
               <p>"Why, mother," she asked, in astonishment, "what have I done?"</p>
               <p>"It's what you haven't done that is the main trouble. You act as if you were in a
                  dream. What are you thinking of?"</p>
               <p>"O, Robert," Hetty answered truthfully, her face flushing under her mother's keen
                  look.</p>
               <p>"Wal, I never! I shall wish he'd stayed in Rhode Island if you are going to lose
                  your senses whenever he is out of sight. He is not so handsome that he need
                  bewitch you. And he's only been on the premises about four and twenty hours. A
                  mere boy," said Mistress Bowen, comparing him in her thoughts with Mark, who
                  seemed in a fair way to be forgotten.</p>
               <p>Hetty tried to look offended, but it was of no use. The irrepressible smiles would
                  sparkle in her eyes, and dimple around her mouth. Her mother watched her with
                  mingled vexation and perplexity.</p>
               <p>"Take care!" she said suddenly, catching a pitcher out of the girl's hand. "That
                  is cider. You can't sweeten the pudding with that. Where did you get these
                  beans?"</p>
               <p>"In the box by the garret door."</p>
               <p>"The very beans that your father took so much pains to save for seed. Well,
                  they're boiling now, and it can't be helped; but I do wish, Hetty—"</p>
               <p>What the good woman wished will never be known, for just here Hetty caught a
                  glimpse through the window of a figure coming up the<pb n="340-341"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000170"/> road, and, throwing down the wooden spoon that she
                  was using, she darted out of the door, screaming, "It is Robert! He's coming!"</p>
               <p>"O dear suz!" exclaimed Mistress Bowen, in despair. "The child has clean lost her
                  wits. Where can the deacon be?"</p>
               <p>She followed Hetty to the door, intending to send Robert directly after her
                  husband; but a single glance gave her the key to the child's strange behavior. For
                  there, in the yard, stood Robert with Aunt Hannah's old clock in his arms, and
                  Hetty dancing around him, laughing hysterically, and vainly trying to talk at the
                  same time.</p>
               <p>"Robert Curtis! What on earth have you been up to?"</p>
               <p>The lad composedly drew a big red-cheeked apple from his pocket and began to eat
                  it. "It's a Humphreys sweeting," he said, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Come into the house and tell us all about it, Robert. O mother dear! I have felt
                  so fidgety all the morning."</p>
               <p>"No need of telling that," replied her mother, now smiling good-naturedly, and
                  patting Hetty's cheek. "Bring in the clock, Robert, and tell us how you got it.
                  Aint you tired?"</p>
               <p>"Not much. It is a pesky, heavy thing, though, light as it looks."</p>
               <p>"But I don't understand how you got it."</p>
               <p>"No. But you will as soon as I get my breath to tell you. I've been down in that
                  medder a-laughing till I'm as weak as water. Sit down, aunt. Let us take it
                  moderate."</p>
               <p>"Wait till I get these things into the oven and off my mind. Come, Hetty."</p>
               <p>Robert made no objection, but sat in silence, eating his apple and watching the
                  quick, handy motions of the two women as they cleared the red coals from the oven
                  and deposited therein the round loaves and pudding-pans, and the inevitable pot of
                  pork and beans for Sunday use.</p>
               <p>"Now, every thing will go on nicely while we listen, Robert. Begin at the
                  beginning."</p>
               <p>"Well, after I left here I wasn't long in getting over to Humphreys. What a
                  rundown, forsaken look that farm has! I slacked up in the hollow below the house
                  and put an extra touch on to my looks. In this way. Look!"</p>
               <p>Hetty and her mother both started, for Robert had crossed his eyes into a fearful
                  squint that baffled all attempts to tell which way he was looking. There was not a
                  trace of expression in his face. The vacant stare was perfectly idiotic.</p>
               <p>"You see," said Robert, calmly resuming his usual looks, "I wanted him to think I
                  was a natural."</p>
               <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6508-00000171"/>
               <p>"He couldn't think any thing else," remarked Hetty.</p>
               <p>"Thank you. He was out in that green shop where you thought I might find him, and
                  there were two other chaps there. One of them was called Jim, and he is, I
                  suppose, the fellow that kept Joe company in your barn. The other chap looked more
                  respectable. I went in, shambling along sideways, as if I was half blind, and I
                  sat down on a bench without saying a word. About the first thing I saw was that
                  old clock stowed away on a shelf with no end of rubbish. I know by that he didn't
                  set much store by it. They all stared at me, and I looked just as I showed
                  you."</p>
               <p>"'A regular fool,' I heard Joe say to Jim; 'wonder where he rained down from. I
                  say,' to me, 's'pose you can talk, can't ye?'</p>
               <p>"'Guess I can.'</p>
               <p>"'Where did you come from?'</p>
               <p>"'From home. Where d'ye think?'</p>
               <p>"'Where is your home?'</p>
               <p>"'In Rhode Island.'</p>
               <p>"'How did you come?'</p>
               <p>"'Afoot. How d'ye s'pose? Guess you aint over and above bright. That's what dad
                  says when I ask questions.'</p>
               <p>"'Your dad is a sensible man,' says Joe. They all laughed at this, but I never
                  smiled. All I did was to look, and I did stare with a vengeance.</p>
               <p>"'Where are you going to?' asked Jim Bates, when they had had their laugh out.
                  'Got any relations about here?'</p>
               <p>"'Some in Boston,' says I. 'Boston is a tarnal big town, aint it? Allers wanted to
                  see it. Mean to now. Is it very far from here?'</p>
               <p>"'O! no. Just over the hills there,' says Joe. 'Only a pleasant walk.'</p>
               <p>"'What time o' day is it?' says I. I p'inted up to the clock. He laughed and
                  winked at the others. 'It's airly in the morning by that clock,' says he.</p>
               <p>"'Is it? And does it keep airly all day?'</p>
               <p>"'Sartain.'</p>
               <p>"'Wal, I should like a clock like that. Could have it morning all the time.' O
                  Hetty! if you had only seen how innocent I looked!"</p>
               <p>"I can imagine it. Go on."</p>
               <p>"'Perhaps, now, you'd like to buy it,' says Joe, falling into the trap as easily
                  as a blind kitten.</p>
               <p>"'Would you sell it if I did?'</p>
               <p>"'That depends on what you'll pay.'</p>
               <p>"'I've got four shillings and sixpence. Dad counted it for me. It's here in a
                  paper tied up.'</p>
               <p>"Joe took down the clock and set it on a box.</p>
               <p>"'It's a wonderful clock,' says he. 'Hate to<pb n="344-345"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000172"/> part with it awfully. Don't see how you could carry
                  it far.'</p>
               <p>"'I could borry a weelbarrer if I got tired. I want it any way. Have it morning
                  all the time.' Here I chuckled so much like a fool that I almost deceived
                  myself.</p>
               <p>"'Wal,' says Joe, 'you can have it. It's nothing to me how you carry it. Guess
                  you'll hold out to get it out of this neighborhood. Promise that you wont sell it
                  about here.'</p>
               <p>"'I never'll sell it at all, to any body,' says I.</p>
               <p>"'Just so. You're the best chap to trade with that I ever saw. Wish there was more
                  like you. Hand over the money. Shillings are scarce here and clocks aint.'</p>
               <p>"I gave him the money in the paper. He untied it and counted it.</p>
               <p>"'It's all right,' says he.</p>
               <p>"Then I took up the clock, and Jim Bates took off the weights and put them in my
                  two pockets. 'You'll carry it better,' says he, 'and the clock will go just as
                  well.'</p>
               <p>"'Thank you, kindly,' says I. 'I guess I'll be getting on a piece afore noon.'</p>
               <p>"I gave a tighter screw to my features, for I was afraid I should show how tickled
                  I felt, and walked out as sober as a judge. How they did laugh! I stopped at the
                  corner of the shop to help myself to these apples—they're the meanest est
                  sweetings I ever saw, not fit for the hogs—and I heard Joe say, 'Takes me to
                  trade, boys. I've got rid of the old lumbering thing, made a handsome profit on
                  it, and sent it where the Bowens never'll find it, or Cap'n Mark either. Killed
                  three birds with one stone this time.'</p>
               <p>"'Yes,' answered the fellow who had not spoken while I was in the shop. 'but after
                  all. Joe, there's no wit in fooling a fool.'</p>
               <p>"I didn't wait to hear any more. I got out into the road, where I could untwist my
                  countenance, for really, Aunt Bowen, I began to be afraid it would stay so."</p>
               <p>Robert was a hero for the rest of the day. The deacon came in to dinner, and the
                  whole story had to be repeated for his benefit. If Joe Humphreys could have heard
                  it, with the accompanying chorus of hearty laughter, he would have nearly expired
                  with rage. As it was, his triumph was to be of short duration.</p>
               <p>On Sunday morning Hetty set herself perseveringly to coax Robert's wiry red locks
                  into a smooth cue.</p>
               <p>"Every body will be looking at you to-day," she said, "and I want you to look
                  well. What a tall fellow you are!"</p>
               <p>"Am I? I haven't stopped growing, I hope. I want to keep on till I'm
                  handsomer."</p>
               <p>"I like you just as you are," was the candid<pb n="346-347"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000173"/> response. "I like to see your nose turn up. You
                  have beautiful eyes, Robert."</p>
               <p>That was true. Unless when purposely distorted, they were large, dark, and
                  expressive.</p>
               <p>"Ow! Suppose you leave the roots of my hair in my head."</p>
               <p>"Did I pull? It's braiding in beautifully. I have a black ribbon to tie it
                  with."</p>
               <p>"It has a color of its own," said Robert, laughing. "Do you think Joe Humphreys
                  will admire it?"</p>
               <p>"Joe admires nothing but himself."</p>
               <p>"And his money."</p>
               <p>"He adores money. It is his God. Not that he has much. He can't get rich. He is so
                  stingy that he overreaches himself. Three years ago, when things were cheaper, he
                  used to 'tend the store, for he was too lazy to work. He likes rum and gin well
                  enough to be drunk all the time, but he never could afford to drink a drop unless
                  some one came in to treat. Then he would get dead drunk, and have to be put in bed
                  to sleep it off."</p>
               <p>"I guess he don't drink much now."</p>
               <p>"No. Every body has to go without. Even the poor soldiers. Father will have to
                  make cider do till the war is over. There, your hair is done. Is it too
                  tight?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I feel as if my nose and eyes were being drawn back into my brains, but I
                  shall get used to it in a few minutes."</p>
               <p>Hetty had scarcely taken her usual seat in the singing-gallery, after watching her
                  mother and Robert in their progress along the aisle to the deacon's pew, when she
                  was startled by an exclamation from the seat behind her.</p>
               <p>"Thunderation! It can't be. It is. Wal, I <emph>shall</emph> die now."</p>
               <p>It was Joe's voice, and it well expressed his mental perplexity. There was
                  something about the well-dressed youth in Deacon Bowen's pew that was strangely
                  familiar. The puzzle was not solved until the congregation stood up to face the
                  singers during the first psalm-tune, when, meeting Joe's inquiring look, Robert,
                  for a brief second, crossed his eyes. It was enough. Hetty's bright eyes
                  intercepted the glance, and she had hard work to preserve an appearance of
                  gravity. Joe understood the whole process of the trick played on him so well that
                  his opening notes resembled howls, or, rather, <emph>squeaks</emph> of
                  despair.</p>
               <p>During the day Robert had several opportunities to treat him to a "look." Joe went
                  home from meeting in a frame of mind altogether unsuited to the day. He hurried
                  out of the meeting-house as soon as the "Amen" of Parson Smith's benediction was
                  uttered, put<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6508-00000174"/> ting on his great-coat on
                  his way down the stairs. But, hurried as he was, he was not more spry than Jim
                  Bates, who overtook him before he reached the road. Joe was not a favorite with
                  Jim Bates, though a kindred rascality often brought them together.</p>
               <p>"Hullo!" shouted Jim, as he came up alongside of his friend. "Are you running a
                  race? 'Tain't respectful to cut out of the meeting-house like that. What are ye
                  afeard of?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing. You mind your own business."</p>
               <p>"Yes, in a minute. How about that trade, Joe? Takes you to trade, you know."</p>
               <p>"Hold yer jaw, can't ye?"</p>
               <p>"Lemme see. How many birds did ye kill with one stone?"</p>
               <p>"Stop your noise, or I'll—"Joe looked up at Jim, who was about twice his size, and
                  the half-uttered threat died before it was spoken.</p>
               <p>Perhaps Robert's state of mind was not more in accordance with the spirit of the
                  Sabbath. He was jubilant over his ability to taunt Joe in any place, under any
                  circumstances. Nature, in making his face plain, had compensated him by bestowing
                  a wonderful mobility of feature. Such variety of facial expression is seldom or
                  never an accompaniment of beauty.</p>
               <p>He was a natural actor, though he did not know it. All his life he had been an
                  accurate mimic of the people about him, much to the scandal of the sober Quakers,
                  who deplored, while forced to smile at his personation of characters that they
                  held in reverence. Added to this was a keen sense of the ludicrous, and a power to
                  inspire laughter in others while his own face wore a sepulchral gravity. It must
                  be confessed that Joe's peace of mind was somewhat in danger of being
                  disturbed.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
               <head type="sub">A BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT.</head>
               <p>AFTER the publication, in 1776, of that immortal State document, "The Declaration
                  of Independence," even the most sanguine among the American people gave up all
                  hope of a speedy peace.</p>
               <p>The years that followed were full of darkness and trouble. A heavy gloom hung over
                  the entire country, only lightened occasionally by the partial successes of the
                  patriot troops.</p>
               <p>It is not our purpose to follow the history of the war. Its blood-stained records
                  have been written by able pens, and every schoolboy knows, or ought to know, them
                  by heart.</p>
               <p>One thing will always stand for the credit of the army. The men who made the
                  battles did not ask the women to help fight them. Although fighting is
                  indisputably one of the "rights" belonging to women, yet the majority of the sex
                  find plenty to do in that line without crossing their own thresholds.</p>
               <p>During the first three years of Mark's absence it was seldom in his power to send
                  letters to his friends. Occasionally a cheering word came, showing the writer to
                  be as full of zeal and courage as ever, but long, weary months intervened between
                  these scanty epistles. Once, a year passed without any direct news.</p>
               <p>Although so many of the best and bravest men were in the Continental ranks, old
                  Weymouth was by no means a prosy, humdrum place to live in. The most was made of
                  the material that remained, and notwithstanding the scarcity of beaux, courtships
                  were prosecuted and weddings celebrated.</p>
               <p>On Christmas eve, 1779, Parson Smith was called to join two couples in the holy
                  bonds of matrimony. This he did so effectually that no lingering hope of divorce
                  ever after entered the heads of the victims. In the first place, Robert Curtis was
                  married to Nanny White, the miller's pretty daughter. This match occasioned no
                  surprise, having grown gradually out of a pleasant acquaintance, and being a
                  suitable one in every respect.</p>
               <p>But people did talk when Joe Humphreys was married to the "Widder Bicknel." The
                  "widder" was a stout, rosy woman, a head taller than Joe, weighing one hundred and
                  eighty pounds, avoirdupois measure, and the happy mother of three girls and a boy.
                  Joe married her because she was rich. Since the marriage of the most energetic
                  among his sisters, his father's farm had<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6508-00000176"
                  /> run down so that it afforded a scanty living for the family. It was so heavily
                  mortgaged that much of the produce was sold to raise interest money, and Joe had
                  the prospect before him of being obliged to work for his daily bread. And just
                  then, like a genial providence, the "widder" began to smile upon him.</p>
               <p>Joe listened with the greatest contempt to the warnings of his mother. "She's a
                  regular driver, Joe, as to business. You know how she used to torment her husband
                  because he was slow. She'll give you no rest for the sole of your foot. I know all
                  about her."</p>
               <p>Joe laughed complacently. "Pooh! Guess I haven't grown up with a house full of
                  women without l'arnin' to manage the pesky critters. Reckon <emph>she'</emph>ll
                  have to toe the mark instead of me. Don't you fret yourself. I s'pose that medder
                  and woodland in old Spain is wuth four hundred pounds clear. Mean to have the wood
                  cut down and sold right off. Calculate it'll seem good to feel some money in my
                  pockets once more."</p>
               <p>The "widder" married Joe for a different reason, which she made no secret of among
                  her intimate friends.</p>
               <p>"I know," she said, "that he is the smallest pattern of a man in the whole town.
                  But, you see, I must have somebody to do chores, and since the war has taken off
                  so many, I can't hire a man at any price. I want him to chore round generally; to
                  cut wood, and bring water, and milk the cows. There is no end of things that he
                  can do as well as a brighter man. I guess I can keep him busy."</p>
               <p>"Do you know," asked a friend, "that he never did a day's work in his life?"</p>
               <p>"Then it's high time he did. I aint a grain afraid to undertake his case. If I
                  marry Joe Humphreys, <emph>he'</emph>ll do the chores."</p>
               <p>There was only one struggle for marital supremacy after the wedding. It lasted
                  several days, for both parties saw clearly the interests at stake; but, alas for
                  Joe! it was a battle from which the "widder" came off with flying colors, and
                  after which <emph>he</emph> "did the chores."</p>
               <p>In one respect the public benefited by the result, for the "widder" insisted upon
                  having the company of her spouse in her pew on Sundays.</p>
               <p>"It aint likely," she protested, "that I'm going to have anybody that belongs to
                  me making a fool of himself that way. You'd orter see yourself once just as you
                  look to other folks. Up there a-squealing like a pig! Not if I know it. Let them
                  sing as can sing, I say."</p>
               <p>Joe threatened to stay at home from meeting. He wouldn't go if he couldn't
                  sing.</p>
               <pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6508-00000177"/>
               <p>"Why, you <emph>can't</emph> sing, you silly gander. What's the use of talking? As
                  for staying to home," she went on energetically, "it wouldn't be wholesome for you
                  to try that game. I've allus had my family to meetin' regular, rain or shine. I'm
                  getting along in life, and I ain't a-going to give up my religion, I tell
                     <emph>you.</emph> I'm ten years older than you are, though nobody would believe
                  it, for you look older than Methusalem hisself. One thing is sartain true, if
                  you're a heathen on Sunday, you will be the rest of the week, and I've enough to
                  do 'thout 'tendin' to Church work."</p>
               <p>After this, Joe's regular attendance upon divine worship was most exemplary. We
                  might drop him from our story now that we are sure he is in safe-keeping, were it
                  not for one spiteful act that he managed to perform.</p>
               <p>He was in Boston with a load of farm-produce to sell, and, as evil fortune would
                  have it, he came across a young soldier named Charles Harding, who had been at
                  home for a brief furlough, and was about returning to the army.</p>
               <p>The unsettled state of the country and the number of Tory spies made it
                  exceedingly difficult for the soldiers and their friends to communicate with each
                  other, and every opportunity was embraced for the transmission of news.</p>
               <p>Joe pretended to be immensely patriotic, and anxious to send news from home to the
                  Weymouth boys.</p>
               <p>"S'pose you know Cap'n Mark Woodward?"</p>
               <p>"I should think I might," answered young Harding, his face brightening at the
                  name. "He is a colonel now. Been promoted. He is one of the best officers in the
                  army. General Washington thinks the world of him. But he deserves it. His men half
                  worship him."</p>
               <p>"Ya'as. Just so." Joe's face would scowl over this news, though he tried hard to
                  look pleased. Harding did not notice his looks, being busy in examining some
                  apples that Joe had for sale. "S'pose you wouldn't object to carrying the—the
                  colonel a bit of news from home. He will be obleeged to you if you can."</p>
               <p>"I should be glad to do so."</p>
               <p>"Wall, you tell him that Hetty Bowen is married to Robert Curtis. You see, he was
                  brought up by Hetty's parents, and she's allus been just like a sister to
                  him."</p>
               <p>"I'll be sure to tell him. I'll write down the names to make sure. When were they
                  married?"</p>
               <p>"On Christmas eve."</p>
               <p>"Does the colonel know the bridegroom?"</p>
               <p>"I expect not. He came to live to the deacon's arter the army moved south. He is a
                  far-off kind of cousin to Hetty. Cap'n Mark has<pb n="356-357"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000178"/> no doubt heered of him if he has heered from home
                  at all. Tell him he is a plaguey smart chap. Suits the old folks exactly."</p>
               <p>"Thank you. I'll try and remember."</p>
               <p>And this was the news from home that reached Mark in his dreary winter-quarters.
                  The portion of the army to which he belonged was at Morristown, N. J., the other
                  part at West Point.</p>
               <p>The prospects of the country were never more gloomy. The sufferings of the troops
                  from cold and hunger and the want of clothing were appalling. Many were obliged to
                  go barefooted, with their feet bleeding from the effects of the frost, and some of
                  the bravest men in the army were thus crippled for life. None, even among the
                  officers, were comfortably clad.</p>
               <p>Often, less than half the usual allowance of food was distributed to the troops,
                  and several times the provisions were wholly exhausted. At the same time, the
                  British army was sumptuously supplied by plundering the people.</p>
               <p>The paper money had steadily depreciated, until thirty dollars were of no more
                  value than one in specie. From the first, the farmers were unwilling to take this
                  money in exchange for provisions, and they soon utterly refused it, for the credit
                  of Congress was exhausted as well as its funds.</p>
               <p>Our modern wars, terrible as they have been, have no record of like privations,
                  and we can scarcely conceive the enthusiastic patriotism that kept the armies of
                  the Revolution in the field in such circumstances. It took, indeed, all the
                  influence of Washington, who was nearly worshiped by his men, to retain in the
                  service the brave heroes who felt themselves so cruelly neglected by the country
                  whose cause they were maintaining at such a cost.</p>
               <p>In this situation, we do not wonder that Mark did not feel the news from home to
                  be particularly inspiring. In the darkest hours, his imagination had drawn a
                  bright picture of the future. It was just the dear old pleasant home, with Hetty's
                  love to illuminate it, but he had carried it so closely in his heart that it
                  seemed a part of his being. For a few days his resolute courage quite forsook him,
                  and death seemed far preferable to life. Then he took up his duties as before, and
                  no one suspected the bitter struggle of spirit in which the Christian had
                  triumphed over the man.</p>
               <p>"I am glad that I left her free," he said. "She will be my dear sister always, and
                  by the time the war is ended I may be able to witness her happiness without
                  regret. Or I may be one of the honored ones who will die for their country. God
                  bless her and help me!"</p>
               <pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6508-00000179"/>
               <p>During the next three years that the war lasted, Mark might have found out the
                  cruel mistake under which he suffered if he had inquired about the home affairs
                  more particularly. There were men in his own regiment who could have enlightened
                  him, but he could not trust himself to converse with any one on the subject, and
                  he had no suspicion that the report was a false one. Twice he was slightly
                  wounded, and once dangerously, before the great victory was gained. But he lived
                  to see the country free.</p>
               <p>When we consider the scanty troops, and scantier supplies furnished by the people,
                  and contrast them with the powerful armies and immense resources brought to subdue
                  them, we cannot help seeing that it was the overruling power of God that wrought
                  out the miracle of American freedom.</p>
               <p>In November, 1783, the patriot army was disbanded, and again mingled with their
                  friends in their native towns and by the home firesides. The whole country,
                  forgetting the niggardly withholding of the necessaries of life which had so often
                  imperiled the cause, and had so retarded the glorious result, was now in a state
                  of exultation that knew no bounds.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
               <head type="sub">HOME AND HAPPINESS.</head>
               <p>YES, the long war was over, and Mark was coming home. Some of the Weymouth boys
                  had already arrived, and they reported the colonel as being well, and likely to
                  appear at any time. There had been some vexatious delay about paying off his men,
                  and the prospect was that many who had given all they had to the cause would lose
                  even the scanty amount due them.</p>
               <p>Hetty scarcely heard these details, though her father fretted over them, and
                  wildly talked of selling his farm and distributing the proceeds among the most
                  needy of the returned soldiers. It was enough for her to know that Mark was coming
                  home. All day she watched the road for a glimpse of him, and went to bed every
                  night with the happy thought that he would surely come to-morrow.</p>
               <p>It was a clear, moonlight evening when Mark came slowly up the road, and turned in
                  at the familiar gate. A bright light filled the kitchen, and shone out through the
                  uncurtained windows. Mark paused outside, and looked eagerly at the<pb n="360-361"
                     xml:id="VAC6508-00000180"/> picture within. It was the same dear group that he
                  had left so long ago, with one addition. Hetty held on her lap a rosy child, with
                  great blue staring eyes, and the brightest of auburn hair.</p>
               <p>This child belonged to Robert and Nancy, but Nancy's mother was ill, and Hetty had
                  brought home the child to relieve its mother. The boy was always contented with
                  Aunty Hetty, and he was now enjoying the unusual treat of sitting up at night, and
                  showing his joy by all sorts of merry infantile pranks.</p>
               <p>The deacon and his wife were looking on well pleased, as all elderly people are
                  apt to do when the little ones are around. The boy had been but two days at the
                  farm, and he was already half-spoiled by the unlimited petting that he had
                  received.</p>
               <p>Mark's eyes grew dim as he watched them. How beautiful Hetty was, with the
                  childish loveliness and pretty ways that he remembered matured into womanly grace
                  and thoughtfulness!</p>
               <p>Her eyes were sparkling, and the changeful smiles came and went as if her heart
                  were a fountain of perennial joy. Little did he think that it was the prospect of
                  his home-coming that so brightened the sweet face, and inspired the musical
                  laughter that it was so trying to hear.</p>
               <p>"Perfectly happy, missing nothing from her life," was his bitter comment as his
                  thoughts involuntarily went back to the time when he was so closely associated
                  with her.</p>
               <p>Mark had been no coward on the field of battle; he had faced the death-speaking
                  cannon without shrinking, yet now he was very strongly tempted to run away. But
                  one look into the motherly face of Mistress Bowen kept him from so foolish an
                  action.</p>
               <p>"No. I will see them all again, and afterward there will be time to settle plans
                  for the future."</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the years of his absence, Hetty knew his step as soon as he opened
                  the outside door.</p>
               <p>"It is Mark, mother. Father, don't you hear his step?" she said hurriedly as she
                  let the little boy slide down to the floor and left him to look out for himself.
                  The deacon sprang from his chair; but Hetty had the door open into the porch
                  before any one could stir.</p>
               <p>Such a cordial, whole-souled greeting! Mark could not help feeling its sincerity,
                  or being moved by the affectionate remembrance in which he had been held. It
                  seemed as if they could never make him welcome enough.</p>
               <p>Yet, after the first excitement of his coming, Hetty drew herself back with a shy
                     tremor<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6508-00000181"/> that she did not herself
                  understand. Something in his manner was new to her. It was not coldness, for he
                  showed his delight in seeing her again without hesitation, still it was very
                  different from the happy return that she had pictured to herself hundreds of
                  times.</p>
               <p>He was changed very little in looks; older, of course, and worn somewhat with
                  hardships, but she had expected that. Home and rest would soon make that right. He
                  had always been thoughtful, but the saddened gravity that showed, even when he was
                  smiling, was surely a new expression. She was glad that he said so little to her,
                  and that her father and mother so absorbed his attention that he scarcely looked
                  at her, for it gave her a chance to watch him. The baby climbed back to his place
                  on her lap, and she began to rock him gently in her arms, humming, as she did so,
                  a low cradle lullaby that she hoped would soothe the little restless fellow to
                  sleep.</p>
               <p>Mark started up suddenly with the first notes, and left the room.</p>
               <p>"What is it?" Mistress Bowen called after him. "What do you want? Let me fetch a
                  light."</p>
               <p>"Only a drink of water, Aunty Bowen. I know where the pail stands. I have been a
                  soldier long enough to know how to wait on myself," he said, coming back and
                  sitting down as abruptly as he had left. The baby sat up straight and gazed at him
                  defiantly, not at all disposed to favorably regard any one who diverted the
                  attention of people from himself. His great blue eyes showed no signs of
                  sleepiness.</p>
               <p>"A fine boy," said Mark falteringly, with the spirit of a martyr, feeling that he
                  ought to congratulate. Hetty, and that his neglect to do so would be
                  noticeable.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Hetty; "but," shaking her head at the child, "he is a naughty boy
                  to-night. He will not go to sleep."</p>
               <p>"No. Me not go s'eep," asserted the boy resolutely.</p>
               <p>"Does he resemble his father?" asked Mark. The question almost choked him, but he
                  was determined to set Hetty at ease in regard to the past.</p>
               <p>"Not much, excepting his hair. Robert has just such a fiery head. He looks more
                  like his mother, I think. He has her blue eyes."</p>
               <p>"Why, Hetty, your eyes are brown."</p>
               <p>"I know that. But I am telling you about his mother's eyes, not mine," said Hetty,
                  laughing. "Don't you remember Nanny White?"</p>
               <p>Mark turned to Mistress Bowen with a bewildered look, and rubbed his forehead as
                  if he<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6508-00000182"/> were trying to awaken himself. "I
                  thought it was Hetty's baby," he said.</p>
               <p>The good mother's face flushed angrily. "Hetty's baby!" she repeated indignantly.
                  "Are you crazy, Mark? It will be time enough to talk about Hetty's babies when she
                  has a husband."</p>
               <p>Her anger was all lost upon Mark, for the whole world, just now so dark, seemed to
                  be putting on all the colors of the rainbow. "Tell me the truth at once, Hetty
                  dear, I cannot bear this suspense. Are you not married to Robert Curtis?"</p>
               <p>"Married!" The mournful reproach of those wonderful, lustrous eyes went to his
                  heart. "Why, Mark, didn't I promise to wait for you?" and Hetty burst into
                  tears.</p>
               <p>It was well for all parties that little Johnnie, seeing her emotion, began to cry
                  as loud as he could scream on his own account. Of course, Mistress Bowen had to
                  take him out of the room, and, of course, the deacon discreetly followed her.</p>
               <p>A few words of explanation made all right, and there were not two more radiant
                  faces in Weymouth than the old folks found beaming by the fireside when they
                  returned to it.</p>
               <p>"I shall write to Charley Harding to-morrow," said Mark. "He is in Boston, and I
                  want to know who gave him that precious bit of home news for me."</p>
               <p>It was a week before Harding's reply came. It was full of earnest affection, and
                  of indignation also that he had been made the instrument of so much unhappiness.
                  "I do not know the fellow's name," he wrote, "but I should know <emph>him</emph>
                  in a minute. He was selling farm produce in the street, and I went out to buy some
                  apples for my mother. Got cheated, of course. He was a little, puckered-up,
                  weazen-faced chap, with yellow hair, and a snarling drawl to his voice. And he
                  looked as mean as Satan. If I ever see him again I'll give him a thrashing, if it
                  is the middle of sermon-time on Sunday."</p>
               <p>"It is Joe Humphreys," said Hetty, after listening to this description. "We might
                  have guessed that, without inquiring. But no one need trouble himself to punish
                  him," she added, laughing, "for he is married to the Widow Bicknel, Mark, and she
                  sees to him. We can afford to forgive him. Don't you think so?"</p>
               <p>Looking into the bright, blushing face before him, Mark thought he could.</p>
               <p>There was a grand wedding-party at the deacon's on Thanksgiving evening. The house
                  was full of guests, and of good victuals, also, which had been provided for this
                  occasion without<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6508-00000183"/> out any regard to the
                  poverty-stricken condition of the country.</p>
               <p>"One is not married every day," said Mistress Bowen.</p>
               <p>"There never was any body like little missy married before," responded Ruby, who
                  came over to help a week before the time appointed.</p>
               <p>Hetty's bridal-dress cost five hundred dollars—in Continental money. It was made
                  of calico, or "chintz," as it was then called. Mark had a brand new suit, made by
                  Miss Tempe, who would not take a cent for the work, because, as she declared, it
                  was only a labor of love.</p>
               <p>There has been no account preserved of the other toilets that graced the wedding,
                  but we have many a time heard about the evening festivities, the candy-pulling and
                  nut-cracking, the dancing, and the playing of blindman's-buff, forfeits, hunt the
                  slipper, etc., etc., in which the old people joined as heartily as the young.</p>
               <p>As temperance people, we shake our heads over the sad fact that, in spite of its
                  costliness, a generous tumbler of hot rum and water was served to each guest. It
                  was the custom of the times, and the good parson sipped his portion with evident
                  relish.</p>
               <p>Cider was dealt out in sparkling profusion to all who desired it, and hot tea and
                  coffee were supplied unceasingly by Ruby in the kitchen, and carried hospitably to
                  every corner of the house by Fuss, who was radiant in a scarlet and yellow
                  waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Charley Harding was there from Boston, and so were all the Weymouth boys who had
                  lived to come home from the war. And Aunt Hannah's old clock newly set up, and
                  ticking in the kitchen, so entered into the spirit of the evening that the
                  fairy-winged hands fairly flew around the ancient dial-plate, and made it time for
                  honest people to go home long before there was any disposition to leave.</p>
               <p>It has been said that a story should not continue beyond the wedding, unless it
                  commences afterward. But we must add a few words.</p>
               <p>Mark took at once his old place in the household and on the farm, leaving Robert
                  at liberty to follow his own inclinations, and seek a change of employment.
                  Nothing but the deacon's urgent need of his help had kept him so long in one
                  place, especially after his marriage. He now took up the business of his
                  father-in-law, who was getting too old to attend to it, and in a few weeks he ran
                  the mill as expertly as if he had been brought up to nothing else.</p>
               <p>In a little time there began to be a change in the home-life at the farm.
                  Baby-faces smiled around the hearth, changing anon into sturdy boys and girls as
                  new-comers crowded them out<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6508-00000184"/> of the
                  cradle. Bright, noisy children they were, full of mischief and play, keeping the
                  good deacon and his wife in a state of admiring wonder from morning till
                  night.</p>
               <p>"I used to think that Hetty was pretty keen," the deacon would say, "and so was
                  her mother before her, but these young rogues do beat all natur'."</p>
               <p>It was a pleasant sight to see the unspeakable pride with which he would marshal
                  them along the meeting-house aisle into his pew, feeling it a solemn duty to sit
                  below and see to them. As he always slept through the main part of the sermon, his
                  oversight was not close enough to be oppressive.</p>
               <p>Joe Humphreys sat directly behind them, where he could not help seeing the row of
                  dark curly heads, or noting the silent feats of roguery accomplished by them
                  during the long-winded prayers.</p>
               <p>It was not an exhilarating view, neither was it especially delightful, to see
                  Robert in the midst of his growing family that already nearly filled the pew on
                  the right. Joe carefully avoided glancing in that direction, for the passing years
                  did not take away Robert's delight in treating him to a "look." But when he stood
                  up with the congregation in singing time, and saw Mark in the deacon's old place
                  leading the choir, and Hetty, beautiful as ever, singing like a lark at his side,
                  the measure of his affliction was full. For Hetty's voice lost nothing of its
                  wonderful sweetness and power for a score of years, and Mark's mellow tenor
                  blended with it perfectly.</p>
               <p>Joe's abject condition at home afforded him no consolation. The "widder's" rule
                  was an absolute one. She had no idea of "men's rights," or, it may be, that she
                  thought Joe too insignificant to be accounted a man.</p>
               <p>"He's completely under her thumb," his mother would say pityingly. "The poor boy
                  don't dare to call his soul his own."</p>
               <p>"Didn't know he had a soul," said Miss Temperance Lincoln, who had been listening
                  to a neighbor's report of the mother's compassionate words. Miss Tempe's gossip
                  was still as welcome as her goose and shears in the families of the farmers. "I
                  don't pity him one mite," she went on. "What did the simpleton expect? He knew all
                  about the Widder Bicknel—how she worried Ezra into his grave, and let him go
                  without a grave-stone when she got him there. He might have known that if there
                  was a will left it had been drawn up under the widder's eye, and tied up the
                  property so's a second husband couldn't tech it. Why didn't he marry some young
                  gal, provided there was one in the<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6508-00000185"/>
                  world fool enough to have him? The widder had had one husband, and that was as
                  much as her share, especially when the war was making men so terrible skeerse. No.
                  I don't pity him, or any body else that takes up with second-hand goods. When
                  Bijah French came over to see me, afore his wife had time to get cold in her
                  grave, I told him that a fust offer would have been bad enough, but I considered
                     <emph>that</emph> a reg'lar imposition. Says I, 'Bijah, it's a real shame that
                  men can't lose their wives without losing their common sense, too.' Wal, he went
                  right straight down and married Dorothy Blanchard, and they fight like cats."</p>
               <p>Hetty's children were all born singers. The babies in the cradle would catch the
                  tunes they heard, and trill out sweet snatches of melody before they could speak a
                  word. The house was full of music.</p>
               <p>"If you want to know what music is," the deacon would say, "you just come to my
                  house some Sunday, arter the afternoon meeting, and hear them go over the tunes
                  they've heard. Bobby and Thomas sing counter as nateral as life, and those girls
                  do make the treble ring out as clear as a flute. Miriam's voice is as sweet as a
                  robin's. She always leads off, and she hits the right key without stopping to
                  think. Never heard any thing like it in all my born days. Why, little Neddy will
                  sit up in his cradle and the tune will ripple out of his mouth as if it was poured
                  out of a kag. Take 'em out of doors in the summer-time, and set 'em all a-going,
                  and it does seem as if the angels had come down from above."</p>
               <p>It will be seen that the sacred service of praise was not likely to soon fail in
                  Weymouth for the want of singers. The quaint old music that they sung has long
                  since given place to other styles of melody, only being occasionally revived in
                  what is called an "Old Folks' Concert."</p>
               <p>The older customs, too, have many of them passed away forever. More comfortable
                  ways have superseded them, making up in convenience what is lost of simple, rugged
                  beauty; yet we are inclined to think that the home virtues grew best in the
                  crowded ring about the old-fashioned hearthstone where the great cheery wood-fires
                  made the center of home.</p>
               <p>Those times will never come back, but the people who then lived are immortal. We
                  shall find them on the other side of the river when we, having in our turn become
                  old-fashioned, shall leave the scenes of our present life to the active
                  generations pressing on behind us.</p>
               <p>Shall we leave for them as pleasant memories as these that we have been
                     recounting?<pb n="372" xml:id="VAC6508-00000186"/> Will people, a century
                  hence, look back to us with the loving regret that fills our hearts as we recall
                  the old Bowen farm which has made the center of our simple story of the
                  Revolution?</p>
