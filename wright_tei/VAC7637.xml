CHAPTER I. Economy Illustrated in a Pair of Shoes--Mrs. Doolitteis . Disgusted. OH, dear me, Mrs. Lovewell, I am heartily tired of visiting that Mrs. Savery. What do you suppose I found her doing yesterday after- noon, when you know it was -so pleasant that everybody was in the. street? Oh, you need not guess; I am sure you never would think of the right thing."  "Indeed, I don't know that I could, but I have no doubt it was something useful.

I should be mortified to death, if I was caught at- such a- piece of busi- ness." "Why, Mrs. Doolittle, you alarm  me.  Pray, what was she about?"  "About, indeed! Why, she was making a pair of shoes." "Slippers, you mean, I suppose; I often do that for my husband."- "Oh, yes, worsted work; that is a very dif- ferent thing. No, it Was a pair of shoes for herself. Slhe had taken a pair of old shoe- soles, from which the tops had been worn out, and had cut new uppers from an old pair of her husband's black lasting pantaloons. Did you- ever hear the like! I was really dis- gusted to hear her talk about it." "Why, wliat' did she say." "Why, she said, 'there now, Mrs. Doo- little, I sat -down after dinner, and commenced the job, with Susan to help me rip off the old soles and bind one of the new shoes, and now you see I have got just as good a pair of shoes, and foalaiught I see, just as good looking as the old -pair that I paid a dollar and a half for. :.t   A NEAT KITCHEN-.     " And that is what I call economy. Now I will go and show Susan how to make a new corn cake for tea. Don't you want to learn?' "I told her no indeed; when I got so poor, and I put a real meaning emphasis upon the word--when I got so poor that I could not keep a cook that knew how to do" her own work, I would come and learn the trade." "Was she offended? -Indeed Mrs. Doolittle, you were rather rude.  You might have learned how to make a very nice cake." "Well I must- acknowledge that I did; no, she was, not the least offended, but insisted that I should go down with her to t kitchen and see how it was done. I had agod mind to refuse, for I expected that I .should get a grease spot on my new silk, just as like as not. I am sure I should in my kitchen; but would you:believe it, hers is as clean as a new pin. Why the very floor looks as white and cleanm as a table. I do think she must keep that Susan of hers scrubbing all the time. For my part I don't see how she ever gets through-all the work and do the washing. too.. I wish I could get such help."   &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7637-00000008"/> 31 2  BECONOMYix 1LL STrTIA'IED. "Mrs. Savery says it is by economy. Econo- my of time, as well as everyvthing else. But about the nice corn cake '" 'Oh yes. Well I never; -why it was just nothing to make. I could have made it just as well as she did." "If you had known how." "Why yes, to be sure; but it is nothing to learn; and then to hear her count the cost. Why she would feed a whole family for six- pence. In the first place she took a cup of Indian corn meal, not over three: cents worth, she said, and white at that-I always use yellow neal--it has more taste than the white -and put it in a clean wooden bowl, and what do you think she mixed with it, to make her cake? Water; nothing but water. Yes a little pinch of salt; but that she said she could. not count the cost of, it was so small; and then she mixed, and stirred, and beat the meal and water together as though she was beating eggs, until she got it into a smooth batter, that would just pour into a shallow tin pan, about an inch deep:- The cake when done was about as thick as my thumb. She first put the pan   NEAT CILDE-R1XEN.    13 into a very hot oven and let it cook until the batter got stiff, and then she opened the stove doors and set the cake up edgeways right before the glowing coals until it got a nice delicate brown crust, and fthen drew it back' and let; it bake slow a long time-half an hour or more I should think." "And was it good V." "Good! why I declare I never tasted any- thing so delicious in all my life. I wouldn't have believed it, that just meal and water could be made so good. But that is not all. Just as she had got her cake turned up before the fire, in can-e her two children-such pic- tures of health-did you ever see the like!" "She says that is' the economy of health.' It is cheaper to keep them healthy than sick, as -well as more comfortable. You found them- very neat, too." "Neat! I never saw the like. But it's no wonder; look at the pains she takes with them. Why, it must keep Susan busy all the time." "Then who does the work?" "Well, Ia don't know. I can't understand it. I wish I could get along so. - But then  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7637-00000009"/> "    ECONOMY ILLUSTRATED. my. children are always-sick. A Hers are always well and that makes the difference." "No, the difference is in always keeping them well. But you. were going to tell us something more about the cake." "Oh, yes. When the children came in) Lilhe said," "Oh imother, will you let me bake a sweet cake for brother Frank and me?" "Yes, if you will run up to your room and put away your things, and get on your aprons." "Directly down theycame, and as I live, both of them with check aprons on. I should not like to see my children dressed in check aprons. It looks so common, and sort of countryfied.  Then Lillie took the bowl of batter, and got a part of a teacupful of mo- lasses, and a spoonful of ginger, and stirred it in, and then she got a cup of sour milk; and ' what do you think that was for?" "I suppose to put in the cake." "Yes, but first she mixed with it a little s8uer carbonate of soda, until she set it all foaming, and then-stirred it into the batter, with a little. mnore meal to. thicken it again, ;   THE CORN CAKE.      15 and poured it into an iron pan about twice as deep as the other, and clapped right into the hot oven, where it baked unt: i we had almost done tea, and then Susan brougtin  smoking hot, and Mrs. Savery cut it up into squares, opening each piece and laying on a \ little lump of sweet butter, and so serving it round to each one; and pulid you believe it, in a respectable family, that that was the only cake on the table. I declare I had no great opinion of corn meal sweet cake,% it seemed to look so mean; and, then I had already eaten hearty of the plain cake, and did not think I would touch this one, but Lillie, with her insinuating little coaxing way-I don't know -' who could, resist her-said I must taste her cake, and with that she asked me to take my knife and lay it open, and- then she took a spoonful of juice out of the quince preserves, and spread over it, and I began tasting and tasting, and would you believe it, the first I thought about what I was doing, I had cleared my plate, and Lilhe was helping me to another piece; she was so delighted to see me eat it with such a relish, when 'I Boy.  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7637-00000010"/> -        L 16     EC6ONOMY ILLUSTRATED. intended to 'give it a taste, just oult of comn pliment.'" "Then it was good P"      . "Good!  I never tasted an thing more delicious. I have often had a cake upon my table that I paid a dollar for that did not give half as much satisfaction; the bakers are getting to chleat so dreadfully. I could have forgiven her about her meanness-don't you think it is meanness'?-in making shoes, or01 putting check aprons on her children, if she had not preached me one of her sermons -upon economy, and actly proved to ime that the  supper, delious as it was, had literally cost nothing -that is, next to nothing. There was the meal three cents--the molasses and salt and soda, three cents-the tea, two cents-the sugar and   milk, two cents-the butter-butter is high now, but that was not over four cents--and let me see, was that all?" "You mentioned some quince preserves." "Oh, yes, but she said they' actually cost less than nothing.  About eleven years ago- it was to commemorate tie first birthday of Frank--she planted a  quince bush, and then   VLA'N TW A. T'I'E.    17 she told how she made it grow, and bear fruit. She .said she always kept the ground loose and covered in the ummer with straw, which she wets with soap\s ds and dishwater, and last year her quince 'ee bore more than she wanted; and so a friend of hers came and brought her own sugar, and did all the work, antd puit up the quinces at the halves, while Mrs. Savery was away on a visit in- the. country. So she. proved, you see, that they really did cost nothing. I wish I . cu(d live so     .       g "I don't see why you could not, you have got a nice place for a garden.": "Yes, full of bushes and flowers, but I have got no quince tree."- "But you must do as Mrs. Savery did; plant one." '"Yes, and I might not live till ithore fiuit. And besides, I nev4r -could do:-aa she does. We hire all our work, and I often tell Mr. Doolittle it costs more to raise a few roses and flowers than it would to buy them., . But then our girls must have'a garden."      ^  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7637-00000011"/> 18    ECONOMY ILLUST-RATED. "Don't you know how Mrs. Savery works hers!" "Oh, yes: her husband is a mechlanic, and knows how to work, and don't mind it, and he spades up the ground before breakfast, and then Mrs. Savery and the children, and Susan all work at it, and that is the way they make their things cost nothing. We live different, you know."  "Perhaps they make it a pleasure, instead of toil. I recollect going in there one day last summer--the door was open, and it was just at sundown, so I walked in and through the house-the tea-table was standing, just, as they left it, and all hands were out in the gar- den as busy as bees.  I recollect Lillie was saving safron, which,1 rs. Savery said would sell for enough to pay for all the medicine they used in a year. Frank was cutting-his third crop of grass from the borders, which he sold to old Capt. Peabody, for I don't know how many quarts of milk. The old lady, you know, makes a living from her two cows. I declare there .  .,   THE OARDEN.      19 was not a spot in that garden that hadn't some- thing useful growing in it. But that was not all; I do believe that garden is the great secret of health of those children. As soon as Lillie saw me, she ran up and shook hands, and said, " she was so glad I had come, for father was just wishing that some of our friends would come in, and then he would cut the big melon." "Melons! why, do they raise melons upon that little patch of ground?" "Why no, I cannot say they do exactly, for the seed was planted in .a barrel of earth-set on the flagging, and the vines were trained up on top of a little flat roof building in the yard, and there they grew six or eight feet from the ground, some sweet delicious water-melons. That was what Mr. Savery said was the econo- my of space. It was ' economy of space' in- deed; for underneath the barrel of earth, was one full of ashes, saved' from their chamber stove, where- they burn wood, and that barrel used to run off a little lye to soften the hard water of their well." -- "Oh, I always buy potash." .  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7637-00000012"/> 20    ECONOMrY ILLULiSTiATD. "And she always saves it. A gallon of lye will soften a large kettle full of hard-water, and as you see, said Mr. Savery, takes up no room, and the leached ashes make excellent manure. That is what makes Frank's grass grow so rank, and our fruit trees look so thrifty." "Well, did you eat the nelon?" "Oh yes, as soon as Lillie mentioned it, her father got up and brought it down, and Susan drew a pail of cold water and put it in; and Frank said then hie would run over and ask Aunt Mary and the girls, to come and join the water-melon party; and upon my word, I do think it was the sweetest melon, and sweetest family circle I ever got into in all my life." . "And was it big enough for all of you?" "Oh yes. I have often paid three or four shillings for one nothing like as good. And while we were eating-or rather while we were talking, after satisfying all of our appe- tites, Susan and all, Mr. Savery told Lillie -to get her-little account book, and show me, not only how she was learning to keep accounts, but how mtuch they were indebted to the gar-   CHECK APRONS AND THCK SHOES.   21 den. Really I never could have believed it. But the best of all, said he, it teaches my chil- dren habits of industry and economy." t' Oh yes, that word economy always comes in."  "Well, I am sure it is a very good word, aad'at this time particularly- necessary for all to learn, and practice too. It would save much suffering among the poor." "Yes, it may be necessary for mechanics, and such sort of folks, to be always saving, but thank fortune, my family are able to live without working like common laborers in the i garden every day. Besides, my children ain't able to do it; they are very'delicate." Perhaps, Mrs. Doolittle, it is the garden, and check aprons, and thick shoes, and corn bread, and all that, that makes Mr. Savery's children so healthy.  And certainly, when they are dressed for church, there are none that look prettier, or attract more attention by- their pretty behavior; if they do work in the garden and get ruddy faces, and dirty fingers." "Well, well, if you ain't getting to be a convert to the Saverys' economy.  I shall  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7637-00000013"/> 22  \  ECONOMY ILLUSTRATED. expect to see you soon, making your own shoes." "I don't know as to that, but I will tell you what you may see me doing-and I intend to begin to-morrow-and that is taking lessons in the art of house-keeping.

"Charlie, said Mr. Lovewell, I have givee my consent freely to this match, but I am afraid that neither you nor Salinda, know'any- thing about the economy of house-keeping, and if you marry a girl ignorant of :that, one wlho has been a reputed rich merchant's daughter, I am afraid that with your salary of a thousand dollars a year, you will run under.

"Spoken like a sensible girl, and worthy of the honest man you have chosen for a husband. I am sure he will be willing to wait for this finishing touch of your education. When will you go?" "If you are all willing, and Mrs. Savery will take me as her pupil, I will go to-morrow morning." "Agreed. Do you all say agreed. Very well. I will answer for Mrs. Savery. And Susan, what a proud day for Susan, for it was her that your mother took, a poor friendless orphan, and learned how to work, and become ti useful woman she is. Come wife, let us go- and see Mrs. Savery, while the young couple have a chat together upon future pros- pects." It was a nine days wonder with Salinda's acquaintance, and boarding-school compan- ions, when they heard that such a rich man's daughter, had not only agreed to marry a plin         d   TLARNING HOUSTEKRPIN(G.  27 mechanic, but had gone to serve a year's ap- prenticeship to learn house-keeping, and some of the most foolish ones, including the Doo- littles, resolved to "cut her acquaintance  as they had no idea of associating with a "kitchen girl," or a "mechanic's wife." This did not disturb Salinda, as she was anxious to commence life just as her mother had done, and see if she could not help her husband as her mother did hers, to build up a fortune, by industry and frugality. Mrs. Savery received, her with open arms, and promised her, "that before a year was over, she would be just as able to take charge of her house, as her teacher; and not only learn the art of living well, but saving all, and actually growing rich upon what in most houses is wasted." "In the first place, we will go up and see where you are to sleep. You know our house. is small, and we have ta economize room, but I am very much opposed to small bed-rooms, because they cannot be well ventilated, and that is of the utmost importance on account of health.

"No trouble is too much when health, com- fort, neatness and respectability are concerned.

I Look here." Mrs. Savery stepped to the toilette table under the glass, and drew aside the snow white cur- tain, and there was a neat little painted wash- stand, with its white bowl and pitcher and soap dish, and drawer, and all the little conve- niences. Beneath that was a square tin tub, made to fit so as to economize all the space,; the whole only taking  up the room of tl: ' toilette table. The stand was set on casters, , and could be rolled out wherever convenient.

On the table was a plain square oak wood box, very neatly made, with a lock, in which all the toilet arti- cles could be kept.    ,  ! Salinda was looking at everythinginsilence, and Mrs. Savery began to wonder if she:was contrasting it with the rosewood work of her room at the hotel. She was. And her opinion burst involuntarily from her lips. "How much more sensible-how neat-how convenient-how good-and yet" Mrs. Savery furnished her the word-" eco- nomical." "Yes, and yet how much more economical. I suppose this did not cost half the money?" "I cannot answer that. It only cost us a little time--odd time-wasted hours with most mechanics. Mr. Savery is a carpenter, and almost everything in the house is the work of his ow hands. or some of his workmen, when ness'was slack, or between jobs, or in some spare hour. That box is the work of a poor lame boy, whom Mr. Savery used to allow to come into the shop and make little articles   THE OAKWN BOX.

In the mean time Salinda was examining the box, finding it was really a very excellent piece of worknanship, and "much like one of her mother's." "Until one day my husband was passing through another street, he met, a lady just coming out of a little wood-worker's shop, with that box in her-hand. She knew Mr. Savery very well, and exclaimed as he saw , him: Oh dear, I am caught in the very act. I was just going to carry this box to you as a present-a little token of remembrance from a poor boy, who through your kindness is making a good living for himself and his old mother." "Mr. Savery was surprised; he did not. know what it meant; but she took him by the arm, and led him into the shop, and theie was the poor lame boy, with just as much as he could do: and he had employed two other lame boys to help him. Overhead, in com-  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7637-00000018"/> 32   i ECONOMY ILLUSTRATID. fortable apartments, lived the old lady, not only well provided for now, but her son was in a much fairer way than some whole young men of gaining wealth, and a respectable posi- tion in society. "I am indebted to you, first, and this good lady second, for all this;" said he, as he hopped forward on his crutches to meet my husband. "You gave me the chance to learn to work, and she gave me the means." "Oh, what a dear, good woman-how I should like to know her." "You do-it was your mother." "Oh, Heaven bless her. How much cause I have to love my mother. That box will be almost an idol in my eyes. It will be a prompter every morning and evening, to teach  me to pray for that mother, and the spread of such a spirit as animates her heart, throughout ,the world."

Mr. Savery was made quite happy in the evening, when his wife related what a pleasing influence the rerminiscence had had upon the  mind of their young friend. About the time Mrs. Savery haigot through showing Salinda all the rooms in the house, and that everything had its place, the porter from the hotel arrived with her trunks and bandboxes, and all the trappings that a modern lady contrives to carry with her on-a journey, in defiance of all'the rules of economy of dress, money, or time.  "Oh dear, where shall I put them all," she thought as she looked out upon the great bar- row load; 'I am sure I wish half of them were back again, and back I will send them, that is positive. I told mother I should not want them."  Unconsciousl, she thought aloud, and Mrs. Savery replied. "Oh no, do not send them back, it would only serve to make your mother think you do not intend to remain long.

Besides, it will serve to teach you your first lesson in economy-econo- my of space-the art of making a small house and contracted rooms serve the purpose of larger ones. We are all too extravagant in house room, when it is so expensive as it is in cities." "I thought; people generally in large towns lived in too contracted space." "Perhaps the poor do, but the fault is more in want of ventilation, than in the narrowness of the apartments. The worst economy in thie world, is the neglect to provide ourselves with fresh air. In a small room, filled with human beings, the whole atmosphere becomes actually poisonous, and destructive of health, and even life, for lack of ventilatiori. The amount of suffering in the Black Hole of Calcutta, is a - lasting memento of this fact. A great many city houses are built with bedrooms in the centre, without any means of ventilation, except through- an open door- into a close room, where all the cooling, eating, and breathing of a large family are in constant   ECONOMY OF VlBi'JTLATION.. - 35 operation. In such rooms, human beings are expected to sleep and live. There is a great want of economy of life and health, in such buildings; but we have no ' Board of Health,' to look after such 'seeds of contagion.'? - "But Frank, you say, sleeps in that room." "True. But look here. There is a Vene- tian blind window opening upon the passage, and here comes a pipe that brings fresh air from the outside of the house. In winter, it passes through the chimney, and gets warm. That opening in the ceiling is another pipe, -that leads also into the chimney, high up, which gives it a draft, so -that the air in this room is always pure. Now this ventilation costs but a trifle, but it saves many dollars, cost of medicine, and, perhaps, precious lives. It is true economy." "And the other rooms, are thqy ventilated ." "Every one of them in the same way."  a "I have not seen any sign- of the openings in any other room. How is it done 2" "You observed --that work stand in your room, and spoke- of the convenience of the foot-board.

Now notice the paper border of the room. Look -up and all around, and see if you can tell which of those little black stripes are openings into the ventilator?" "By looking close, I see there are some in each corner of the room. They are admirably contrived, and I should think the air could never get very bad." "No, not if there were twenty persons sleeping here." "But your house is not fully warmed by hot air, is it?" "No; because we have no furnace. We only economize the heat of the kitchen fire. When Mr. Savery built the house, he inserted a hollow cast-irou chest in the back of, the chimney, where it would always take up the waste heat that usually escapes -up the flue, till it is often hot fifty feet from- the fire. Into the bottom of this chest, a pipe opens from out doors, and another from the top, leads the heated air to every room in the house. In the summer time the hot air is shut off, and ano-   WARMNG THE HOUTSE.     37 ther opening brings the air fresh, and sweet -- from the flower garden." "I notice anew form of stove in the sitting room." "No, the stove is the old form of, air-tight wood stoves--great economizers of fuel-and that is a new attachment, called Tillman's Radiator. You see it is a hollow drum set up. endwise, just behind the stove, through which the smoke pipe passes several times upaid down. At that end next the floor, the cold 'air, which always falls by its specific gravity to the bottom of the warm room, comes in among the hot pipes, and there absorbs nearly all the heat, which thus escapes from the top into the room, and thus by preventing the heat from escaping up the chimney, saves nearly one half the cost of producing it. I am told that where these radiat lizave been- attached to a large and expensve caal stove-in a public' room, that it 'enabled the- occupants to sit quite back, with more comfort than they used to find in close- proximity with the stove."

"Your mother is right. I don't believe pure religion can dwell with squalid poverty and discomfort. The poor, miserable irreli- gious portion of mankind must be clothed, and fed, and better housed and cared for, before they can enjoy the holy influence of religion. It is a sad waste of time and money, to endeavor to civilize and Christianize such people by ar occasional sermon. Dirt and wretchedness work no good influences upon the human mind. But de&amp;r me, how we ;:have run off from the subject. I was going to show you how to dispose of the contents of your trunks, even in your small room." "That trunk is full of books. I need not unpack them." "Of all things else, your books should be in sight; where at any moment you can lay your hand upon the one 6f your choice.

But where can put them" " "I have thought of that. Your mother told me that you had a good many, and asked  us if you should bring them all. We said all. Mr. Savery said he would provide for them. Now see here." She went out and brought .d-a set of hanging book shelves., The lower one was about three feet long, and the upper one half that length, so that when the cord was hung up on the strong iron hook in the wall and the shelves filled, it formed a pyramidal pile ,of books, literally "four stories" high and very neat and pretty. Salinda was delighted. It was plenty large enough for all her, books, and as she remarked when it was finishd, as it hung over the work table, it took up no room.

Would you like to have such a one here for her to sit upon, if she likes it, when she calls to visit you?" "Certainly; but not so expensive. I sup- pose that cost thirty or forty dollars." "And you can have just as good a one for one-tenth of that sum, and find a place for your trunk, where it won't be in your way." "Oh, do tell me how. You are so full of contriving, and money and labor saving, that it does seem as though you could not take a step without learning me something.

There was a little click like turning a key in a lock, and presto, change, the pretty lounge was transformed into an open trunk. Salinda uttered an expression of astonishment, and declared she should not be surprised to see the table turn into a big arm-chair. "You need not; but I thought you already understood that secret. Come with me into our room." . There was a neat little round table standing in the centre of the room.

This' is an excellent contrivance for small rooms like ours. Mr. Savery saw one of these exhibited at some fair, and the patentee gave him permission to build one for himself. But let me show you about the trunk. You will want about four yards of this sort of furniture covering; it will cost 378 cents a yard; and you will want as many yards of stout muslin, to make the cushions. One is made fast to the trunk and covered, and the other in shape of a large pillow to sit up against the wall, or lay down to rest upon thus. The lower part of the trunk is just covered with the cloth slightly stuffed to prevent the heads of the trunk nails from being seen, or felt. If at any time the trunk is wanted, for travelling, the whole can be taken off in five minutes. You shall cover yours with stuff to match Tillie's, and then if you should wish you can set the two together, and form a very comfortable place to lodge, or in case of slight indisposition to lounge near the window and work, or read, or sleep.

"No, I did not; but you are deceived, it is not hair; although it looks and feels so much like it. It is moss-generally called Spanish moss.

There is another cheap article for cushions and mat- -tresses lately introduced called German grass. It is a product of the sea." "Pray tell me if your nice mattresses are all made of moss?" "All but one, and that is the poorest in the house. We bought that as it is." "Bought that as it is? Did you not buy them all as they are?" "Oh no, we made them ourselves.

No young mind can properly digest a whole volume upon any subject, at one hasty perusal. No one should read more than an hour or two at a time. You might as well try to eat enough at once to last a'week, or do a month sleeping all in one nap.

'He did more than that to Salinda.

It is no wonder that his children love him so-who could help it?" It is certain that Salinda, with her warm nature, could not, if she had tried, which was the furthest thing from her mind. Strange feelings too, this embrace gave her. It was the first fond parental one she had ever received since she was a child.

And Salinda would as soon have thought of putting her arms around a marble statue and kissing its cold lips, as offering such an act of affection to her father.

"I felt," she wrote years afterwards, "as though a chain that had hitherto held me in a cold atmosphere had-suddenly broke, and I bounded forward into a life of love.

The latter saw what was pas- sing in her mind and said: "I am learning Lillie, while I; am well, to do what her father would require if I was sick, or away.

For a minute all were' silent, and then Lillie took up the tea-pot, and offered her mother a cup of tea. Mrs. Savery replied, "To-night, at least, Salinda is a stranger--you will serve her first. That is a simple act of good breeding." Now each member offered to another such dishes as were convenient to the offerer, until all were served. Slinda was struck with admiration of the table furniture. Mr. Savery was a man in humble circumstances, yet the service was rich, though very plain.

Salinda thought them delicious; she had never seen anything like them before. "How are they made? I am so ignorant of everything, that I shall appear to you a perfect know-nothing." Susan was called in for an explanation. "I mix the meal and water, with a little salt, into a well-kneaded, stiff' dough, and then I take a lump in my hands and flat it down nearly as thin as this. So I go on Oll I get all I want laid upon my pie board "-- Mrs. Savery interrupted her with a remark  that, ' Susan never put dough on the table, no matter how smlall the batch." "Sometimes I add a little flour as I finish kneading. Then I pass the rolling-pin over them till all are of an even thickness.

Frank held up his saucer to Lillie, and sim- ply said, "If you please, sister." She under- stood him, and poured it full of sweet milk. Turning to Salinda she said, "Do follow Frank's example-you don't know how nice these wafers--that is what we call them-are in milk." She did follow suit, and thought she had never tasted a sweeter morsel of wholesome food in her life. "I have eaten mush--or as Barlow calls it in his poem, hasty pudding-and milk, but I am not fond of it, for it always seems to me that it has a raw taste." "That is because it is hasty pudding," said Susan. "Mush cannot be cooked in less than one hour, and it is bette'r to be cooked four hours.

If we are to have mush for supper, I generally make it while the range is hot with the dinner cooking, as well to save fire, as that it is so much better."' "And still better, Susan," said Mr. Savery, "when you fry it for breakfast. But after all, the great secret in having anything good, is to have it properly cooked." ' Not altogether sir, for the best cook in the world cannot make good bread or mush of corn meal if it is badly ground. I recollect reading when I was quite a child, in Judge Buel's paper, called the Cultivator, 'that no grain but corn could be absolutely spoiled for human food, by being ground too fine,'-I believe that can; for example, it increases in goodness from corn flour, up to coarse hominy, or grains of corn hulled." -  There is another thing you believe about corn, Susan."

"Yes, sir, I do; because it contains more starch and less oil, and always keeps sweeter. The yellow variety is best to make pigs grow fat fast. It is not so easily digested by human stomachs." "Susan, will you tell this young lady how you keep a barrel of meal sweet through hot weather?" "I think sir, you might tell that, for you showed me. It is very easy, though. Mr. Savery just nailed three strips of board, about two inches wide, into a triangular tube, and bored it full of small holes, and I set that up in the centre of my meal barrel, which allows  the air to reach the middle of the meal, and it never gets musty.'  "Somebody," said Mr. Savery, "has pa- tented a process for keeping flour in the same way, by inserting a tin tube." "I don't see, father," said Lillie, " how flour can spoil, when it is so perfectly dry." ry-  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7637-00000038"/> 72    ECONOMY ILLUSTRATED. "There"is your error.

All seemed astonished at this, but none doubted it, because Mr. Savery never made such a statement before his children, without good authority. 'Salinda took up the silver sugar bowl to look at the mark. It was perfectly plain, but solid and strong. She wondered to herself whether their table had been set with a few extras, be- cause she-was present. Mrs. Savery was pos- sessed with large intuitive faculties. She perceived what was in Salinda's thoughts, and replied to them just as though they were spoken. "No, we never make any change in our table-it is the same in food and furnishing, whether strangers are present or not. -We use silver, simply because it is economical; so we use it every day.

"One of the first duties of every woman, whether a mother or not, who is placed at the head of a family, should be to inform herself of the quality of provisions, and how they should be cooked, best to promote economy and health. "An article that is very suitable for winter food, may be quite improper for summer. For instance, fat meat, or strong animal food of any kind, gives out heat to the body, while fruits on the other hand are cooling. Buck- wheat cakes, which we are so fond of in cold  weather, would not be at all suitable in mid- summer. Again, food should be suited to the different stages of life. What would nourish an adult, would kill a babe. A hard laborer can eat fat meat and crude vegetables; but : such a diet would never suit a literary person, or any one that lives much within doors. The more oxygen is taken into the lungs, the more food can the stomach digest.

Sugar is one of the cheap- est articles of human food, because it has a great deal of the oxygen-feeding property con- centrated in its substance; but because of that concentration it cannot be used alone. It must be mixed with farinaceous food, or with fruits, and eaten in small, quantities at a time, and then it may, in fact should be made a part of our daily diet. Crude vegetables have but very little of the life-sustaining principles in their composition, yet they are extremely valuable to distend the stomach, and mix with the meat during the progress of digestion. A- man could not live upon sugar, starch, and  glue, notwithstanding they contain the very substances that the chemical laboratory of the stomach extracts from the coarser articles h- consumes. The stomach can create nothing. It only digests, separates, appropriates or dis-  solves the different portions of food received.

No lady ever felt happy and comfortable in her own house, while she knew that her kitchen girl knew more than her mistress.

"Our old cook at the school used to-put her meat in a pot of cold water in the morning and let it soak, to grow tender, she said, till towards noon, and then put it on a brisk fire and keep it boiling as hard as possible till done." " And then throw away the pot liquor 2.' " Not at once. She always set it away to get cold and then took off the fat. Of course she would throw away the remainder-what else could she do with it 8. ''It is just as I expected. She threw away nearly all the gelatine of the meat, and saved the fibre for food, which contained but littkle- more sustenance than so much straw.

"Yes sir, often; but I did not know but that was always boiled out of the meat." "It cannot be boiled out; but it is almost always soaked out by just such a foolish pro- cess as you describe. Cold water dissolves the albumen of the flesh, and hot water hardens it, or rather cooks it in the substance of the meat. "To satisfy yourself, break an egg in cold water, and let it soak as long as the cook did her meat, and then boil it and see what has become of the white. It will be' dissipated through the water. Now drop an egg into boiling water, -and see how quick the-white coagulates, and forms a compact mass around. the yolk. It is just so with a piece of beef. It contains a somewhat similar substance, that dissolves, or soaks out, in cold water, and is lost, unless for soup, and then the meat always should be put into cold water an hour or more before it is put to boil. But meat that is to be eaten, should never be soaked a minute in cold water, but should be plunged at once all over in water boiling hot.

It is idle to try to force the pot to boil harder as many do, because the heat of boiling water cannot be increased, and meat will cook in a temperature of 165 degrees. It only needs the full heat of boiling water until the blood and albumen is set, and then it cannot be dis- solved and made to escape:in the water. "A piece of meat put down to roast, should- be brought as near a hot fire as possible at first, and(ot suffered to heat and stew slowly.

Potatoes should never be put in cold water. If dropped one by one into boiling water, they will never be- come sodden.   You heard what Susan said of those little corn cakes-she put them between two hot irons until the outside was crusted over--that should be the rule with all bread and meat, roasting, baking, or boiling, unless you want to extract the juice of the meat for soup.

PRECISELY at six o'clock the next morning, Susan's bell rung for breakfast, and in pre- cisely five minutes afterwards, all were seated around a snow-white cloth, and a breakfast fit for an epicure. It was now the month of May, and Mr. and Mrs. Savery, and Frank, had all been out in the garden at work for an hour; Lillie would have been with them, but for Salinda and her books. It was delightful when Lillie met her parents, to see how pleasantly she said good morning mother- how do you do father-are you well brother; and to hear their kind expressions towards her and Salinda, made the latter feel as though she would not exchange her present- situation for hotel life, or boarding school, upon any consideration whatever. "Mother," said Lillie, "I shall serve you first this morning, since Salinda begs that she may  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7637-00000044"/> 84    ECONOMY ILLUSTRATED. not be treated as a stranger. Will you have chocolate or tea? We have discarded the use of coffee," said she, addressing herself to Salinda; " but if you are wedded to it, I pre- sume you can have it." "Thank you, I never take anything but black tea, not very strong, and only one cup at a meal." "Father will have chocolate, for that is about half his breakfast." As this meal was so much like our own ideas of proper eating, we are inclined to give some of the particulars. The remainder of yesterday's dinner of baked beans, was "warmed over," and the pork cut in small slices, white and  cold on a plate. The little pieces of corned beef lhad all been chopped into a fine hash, with some potatoes. A1-the dry bread had been madG into a  delicious dish' of milk toast. Frank  had a few radishes from his early planting, of which he was not a little proud. But what took the eye of Salinda most, was a smoking dish of grains of whole corn, as white as snow. She had never seen anything like   OMNY AND ECONOMY. -    85 it before. She had frequently seen what is called hominy, or samp, or hulled corn, but those dishes were unlike this, both in taste and looks. She asked, of course, for informa- tion. "This is a regular breakfast dish with uss" said- Mrs. Savery. "It is both nutritious and wholesome."  "And economical," added Mr. Savery. "Yes, and to very many, that is the most important part of the consideration. For the last year it has not cost much more per- bushel than the average price of potatoes; and it cer- tainly contains more than double the nutri-    : ; ment, and not in too concentrated ca form to   ' be healthy. This is corn hulled by machinery, leaving the grain nearly whole. We' often make use. of another kind of hominy, made by cracking the grain more or less fine, the coarser the better, in a common mill, and then sifting and winnowing out the meal and hulls. We rather prefer this sort, and on account of a dollar going so much further in . a family when expended for hominy, instead - of potatoes at one or two dollars a bushel, this ? *' s ,  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7637-00000045"/> excellent dish ought to be more generally known." "How is it prepared? I like the: taste, and your reasons for its use so well, that I am anxious to learn the art of cooking it properly. I am sure that which I have seen heretofore, has not been prepared like this." "Put it in soak over night in tepid water. Boil it gently in a porcelain or tinned kettle, at least two hours in the same water, adding more if necessary, and taking care not to let it scorch, and that all the water is absorbed when taken off. Keep it in the same vessel, warming it over from'time to time, until con- sumed." "Do you add salt or butter?" "Lever while cooking.  Boil it in soft, clear water only. At the table, you may eat it with salt -and butter, or sugar, or in milk, or mix it with your- meat gravy. It is a  good substitute for rice in a pudding. It is excellent fried in a little bacon fat, like mush, to a   nice brown.  We will try that some morning."            . "I am sure this is a  secret worth knowing. I   I have often thought how much is wasted in some houses, and how little is known in all," of the economy of purchasing and preparing food. I have read somewhere, that one half * of the American people wasted enough to feed the other half; and that the greatest kitchen  I curse, was a frying pan; but I never under- stood why."              --- "It is because that meat cooked in--th:a.   -. is about the worst cooked of any way it can be' both for health and economy. I don't know ,- of but one thing worse than the smell of burnt . grease in the frying pan, and that is that it  should be taken into the stomach for digestion. The usual practice in frying meat or anything else, is to put- only enough fat in the pan to  burn and blacken, and scorch the meat, or fish, ' often giving it -a bitter taste. If any article is  to be fried, fat enough to float it should be  used, and that heated as hot as possible withouti] scorching, and then. plunge the meat, fish, chicken, dough, potatoes, apples, &amp;c., all over in the hot fat at once.

Meat and chicken can always be better cooked in some   i    - *  ', X: i' ' -. - "-:2  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7637-00000046"/> 88    ECONOMY ILLUSTRATED. other way, besides frying. Fried potatoes and fried apples, if properly done, are very good food. Fried cakes, or dough-nuts, are a great Yankee dish, but are often badly cooked. They are fried in too little lard, and soaked with burnt grease, forming a most unhealthy com- pound. I shall endeavor to tell you by and by several methods of cooking meats, both economical and healthy. For instance, a stew that we often have and which is eaten with a good relish, is made of a pound of beef, that fried or broiled, would have looked like a very diminutive breakfast for half a dozen persons. Now, with the addition of two or three pota- toes, and the gravy of our last roast, thickened with crumbs of stale bread, it makes an ample breakfast for us all." "Yes mother," said Frank, ' and the gravy on the hominy is most delicious. Besides, the meat is a great deal more tender than it would be fried." "You are taking lessons all round," said Mr. Savery to Salinda, laughing heartily. "And for which I am truly thankful. I shall endeavor to profit by all I hear and see.   WORK FOR THE DAY.     89 Are you going now sir? I hope I have not detained you."  "Not long. We generally take our time to eat all our meals. I consider it about the worst waste of time to eat in a hurry. Susan, will you give me my dinner- pail. I shall see you again at six. Good bye." Lilhe was not to be cheated of what she had always been accustomed to, because a stranger was present, and she ran after him into the  entry, and a slight sound followed, such as has often betrayed a kiss in the dark. "Now Salinda," said Mrs. Savery, "how have you apportioned your time for the day  for there is as much in economy of expendi- ture of time, as in the expenditure of money. Frank, what are you going to do?" "I shall work an hour in the garden, before school, and then I shall 'wash my face and comb my hair,' and-you know the rest ;" and away he ran to his work, whistling a merry catch to the mocking-bird that hung from his mother's window, which the bird at once'took up and repeated, and so they echoed each other.

Salinda replied to the question addressed to her, that she had taken the matter into consid- eration, and asked Mrs. Savery for Lillie's company half an hour to go out and buy the stuff for the gauze curtain for the books; the calico curtain for the dresses, and the stuff for , the lounge. "And while you are out, you may buy some stuff for a mosquito net, which you will want by and by, and may as well have on hand. , I offered to get it, but your mother would not listen to it. She said, I I want Salinda to begin' 'to provide everything for herself.' It is all very well. You may get your hat on at once, Lillie, as:instead of half an hour, it will take a full One, and by that time you will have to get ready for school."  "And when I return," said Salinda, "I shall work till about eleven o'clock, and then I have it- an engagement with Susan in the kitchen." "I wonder what is on hand?" said Lillie. "Nothing unusual; I am only going to take my first lesson in bread-making, and learn how to do that very difficult piece of cooking, boil a potatoe."   MOSQUITO NETS.     91 "In :^ying your miosquito net," said Mrs. Savery, as they were goffig out, ', recollect that of all colors, green- is 'the best for the eye to rest upon as it wakes in the morning, and red or pink the worst. A light blue is very good, and a rather more durable color. White soils  too easily. For the curtain, a drab ground, with a small sprig or vine would be pretty. I always select calicoes or carpets, with figures that have some meaning-something that re- presents something in nature. Everything of that kind ought to be made useful rather than fanciful. For instance, a carpet might be - made a complete study of tropical plants, in natural colours, the names and uses, of which could readily be learned by children." Thank you, for these useful hints, particu- larly as to colors. not only now but for the future." Lillie," said Salinda as they were going down the street, " what color is your mosquito bar?"

And then, in case of a little indisposition, they are so good to keep off the flies. Miy father says it would be good economy for any farmer to pay for mosquito nets to enable his hired men to sleep well; they would do so much more work." Salinda had obtained the information she wanted. She merely wanted to know that Lillie's bed was unprovided, so that she might buy two nets just alike, as well as two cur- tains to shield the dresses; for she already felt that she could not do enough to pay for all the useful information she was daily obtain- ing from every member of this family. She said nothing of her intentions, but* managed to give them all a pleasant little s prise one day, to find a net up at each beb exactly alike. She chose for the curtain, a piece of calico, with a drab ground-like ground color, she said-with a delicate sprig of the hop in full bearing. "The very sight," said she, I may have a sort of magnetic influence, and induce ?:) sleep, as well as a hop pillow." .0,6   FIRST LESSON -IN THE KITCHEN. 93 It was a sensible idea, for the mind certainly has a powerful influence upon the body. It would have been no hard matter to read what was passing in the mind of Susan, when Salinda came down to the kitchen; for it was printed upon her face. "Now," she thought, "I shall have an opportunity to pay a part of the debt of grati- tude I owe this sweet girl's mother. But for f her, I might have been a beggar, thief, or at best a rag picker in the street; for I was a helpless orphan, without a hand to guide, or tongue to give me a kind word. She took me from the street to a school room, and taught, and fed, and clothed me; and when :she saw that I was not all viciousness, she took me home. Oh! how many poor children might be saved in the same way. But it always  - appeared to me that such children in the  -  streets of a city, only held an equal rank and value with the rats. Both are looked upon as vermin that are eating into the big cheese of  society, and still those whose substance they : devour, only seek to punish them for having an appetite, instead of training that appetite  i ,W  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7637-00000049"/> "    ECONOMY ILLUSTRATED. to relish other than stolen food. Talk of eco- nomy! The worst economy on earth is this waste of human beings. Worae than waste, for these poor children are not only permitted ' but compelled to grow up as worthless as rats, to prey upon all that come within their reach when their teeth are grown. "Is human labor so worthless that it should thus be wasted? What if every woman who has the means should do as Mrs. Lovewell did by me, where should we find any vagabond children in the next generation?" It is curious to observe what magnetic power there is in a smile-one that comes from the heart. Salinda was won by the kind look and words of Susan, to feel that she was not looked upon as an intruder in the kitchen, and that she might ask questions that would tire the patience of one less willing than her present instructor, and still receive pleasant an- swers. "I have come," said Salinda, " to see you make bread, and I suppose I shall ask what will seem to you a great many foolish ques- tions."   "EARNING TO MATAEi BREAD.  95 "Which I shall answer strictly according to Scripture." "What? answer a fool according to his folly." "Yes, but God never intended that those answers should be such as would make him more foolish. No; if you, compared to me,   are not wise in bread-making, it will give me as great pleasure to teach you as ever it did your mother to teach me. "This is what we call a sponge. I set it this morning, and you see it is now ready to knead into loaves. This is by far the most important part of breadmaking." "Please tell me about setting the sponge, as you call it." "Oh, yes! Well, I use about ten quarts of flour, which I put into this large wooden tray, and make a hole in the centre and pour in about half a pint of brewer's yeast, mixed with a pint of water, milk warm. As I pour it in gradually, I stir some of the flour in with it, till it forms a batter. Then I take a hand- ful of dry flour and sprinkle over the top.

Now I set my sponge by the fire, or in the sun, and go about my work till it is ready to knead." "How do you know when it is ready?" I frequently looksat it, and when it seems to be- working, that is, sponging up, so as to crack the covering of flour, it is then ready to form into dough." "That is what you are going to do now." , Yes; and therein lies the secret of good bread.' Not one in ten ever kneads the dough enough.- It is hard work, and requires strong hands, and- can only be done by hand. I begin thus; by pouring in warm- water with one hand and mixing it with the other. It will take about two quarts, so that altogether I shall use of yeast and water, about half as many pounds as I have flour. Clear soft water is the best. I use cistern water, filtered. Milk-warm or blood-warm is' about right. I add a table-spoonful of fine salt. . This I scat- ter o er the sponge before I begin to knead.

"There, now, you see how it adheres together, so that I could draw it out in strands and braid a rope. Now I form it into a compact ball, and cover it up, and set it here in this warm spot of sunshine that is pouring through the window upon the kitchen table. I shall let it stand there about an hour, and then take a knife and cut it evenly into four parts, each of which I shall take separately upon my pie board, and form it into a loaf to suit one of these pans. By timing my work in this way, I cook my dinner, and bake my bread by one heat in the stove." "What is that for?" said Salinda, as she saw her cut off a lump of dough as large as her fist and lay it aside. "That is to leaven another baking. Do you see those pieces of stale bread which I am soaking in milk. I never waste a morsel of bread. Either in pudding, gravy, or in rusk, I use up 'll.

"I used to when potatoes were cheap. At a dollar or more a bushel, it is not good eco- nomy. I often add a little corn meal, but I always cook it partly first, in a thin mush.

"Speaking of honey, I am quite surprised to find that- Mr. Savery keeps bees, here in town. I thought they must always be kept in the country.' "That is quite a mistake. Here is our gar- den and half a- dozen others right around here, and a good many trees, and then it is only-' half a mile ovt into the orchards and fields.

The economy of space, too, as exhibited in the   formation of their cells, and the discipline of the family to the government of one head, are all worth studying.

Oh! a nice piece of fresh beef, not exactly like the French bouilli, but after a way of our own. It is a piece of the rump, from T7 to i10 pounds, which was boiled in soup yesterday, of which we made our dinner without cutting the meat. It was slightly flavored with onion, parsley and thyme.

In the season of them, we always add tomatoes. Now we substitute tomato catsup. This asparagus you will find fresh and tender. It is a healthy vegetable at this season. How will you eat your lettuce. With sugar, as Frank is fixing his?" 'I never tasted it that way. When I have been at school, the old housekeeper w qs always scolding about our using so much sugar, and I don't know what she would have said, if any one had used it upon lettuce." "She knew nothing of eonomy. I should have allowed you to sweeten your water, bread, milk, vegetables and meat if you liked it; so you did not eat raw sugar, you might have all you wished, that is, in place of the same cost of other food." "I declare the lettuce is much better this   GREENS.       103 way than as it is usually fixed at the hotel, with mustard, oil, vinegar, pepper, salt, cat-  sup, etc., and I dare say,- more hiihy.'"

"It is a compound, I think. Frank knows best, he gathered them. How is it, Fr'nk?"

I wonder how much she will credit my two dandelions." "I don't know, Frank; how much do you think they were worth?" "Well, they were good big ones, but I guess on the whole, you may set down the whole mess of greens at two cents." 'Thij0s a very fair estimate, my son; and I am glato see you inclined to be just, even in your dealings with the garden. You will find it saves a great many cents in the course of the year."

What a remark- able boy," said Salinda, to his mother, "for one of his years. I do not understand why one child should be so manly, or womanly, and another so childish." "It is because they are kept- so childishy by their parents. The mind, the natural facul- ties have no chance to develop their power. Infants have the organs of voice, but do not use them because the reasoning faculties have not yet taught them the meaning of words. As soon as that faculty is developed, children become great talkers, mere chatterers, many of them. Those who hear correct language, acquire and use it. Without giving a child ideas, how is it to express them? Without giv- ing a child to understand what its ears, eyes, and hands are for, how is that child to exercise anything but the natural faculties of a child. "To improve a child's organ of language, you must converse with that "child, not in namby pamby baby talk, but as though you were con- versing with a man or woman. If my children talk manly, it is because they never hear any  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7637-00000056"/> 1038 -  nECONOMY ILLUSTRATED. other language from their parents. Frank may seem a little forward, sometimes, but it is because he has a natural vein of humor, and vivacity of disposition. My children are not petulant, because they never see anything of the kind at home, and the little they see abroad, only serves to make them love hoqne quiet all the better." "But you do not think that all children are bomr alike?" "'Oh, no, by no means. Some of the per- ceptive faculties are much stronger than others in different individuals. I have heard of a person so deficient in the organ of color, that he could not tell green from blue, or yellow ifrom white. You seem surprised, yet reflect a moment. By candle light, you cannot do it yourself. To such a person, in daylight, the same inability to distinguish the difference in shades continues. Now it is hardly possible, if those having charge of that person in child- hood, had taken constant pains to develop this organ, that it would not have been improved., Many children have the organ of Causality constantly blunted, and the intellect made dull, by that universal -check-' doi' ask so 2 k    *    TALKING' WITH CHLDREN.   10-9 many foolish - 4 t8ons, many foolish questions,' -put upon their in- quiring minds. Is it foolish for a child to inquire the cause of, what is to him, a pheno- menon? I remember when a child, I went with my father, who was one of those men who never could bear to hear a child ask ques- tions, to see a fountain play. The beautiful jets of water spouted into the air, sixty feet, and fell in silver and diamond sparkling drops, all around. My first inquiry was, who makes it play?' I was answered quite short, 'nobody, you silly child.' 'Then,' said I, earnestly, . 'what makes it play?' I was not kindly answered with a short description of the laws that govern water, but told not to ask so many foolish questions. Do you know what I thought then? If I ever grow to be a woman, I never will tell a child not to ask so many foolish questions. Acting upon that impres- sion, so graven upon my heart,as it was burn- ing with desire to know the cause of that water spoiuting into the- air, I have ever en- couraged my children to ask questions.' I have told them there is acause for everything.  Study to find out that cause.

I ask questions for them to answer. For instance: one day I saw Frank bringing some old lime into the hen yard, and I asked him what that was for. 'Because' said he, 'the shells of eggs are principally composed of lime.' 'Who told you so? .' No one; I read it in a book, and I said to myself, then hens-must eat lime; how else could the shells be formed. I did just what you have always told me, mother. I argued from effect to cause.' This was but a trifle in itself, but it taught me what was the effect of early train- ing upon a young mind. We have always tried to impress upon him the good effect of manly actions. We have developed his natu- ral faculties, without crowding his education in school. I have been encouraged in this course by an elder brother, the uncle Ephraim you hear Tillie talk about. He was here some years ago, and before he started home, he wrote for his son Charles to meet him in Chi- cago, on a certain day, with his carriage and horses. Why, Ephraim,' said I, 'how old is'   EARLY TRAINING.     1" Charley?' 'Well, let me see,' said he, 'this is September, and he was eight in March.' ' And do you expect him to drive forty miles alone, and then, what if he should not meet you. Something might detain you.'  He replied, ' The -road is plain, he knows the way, and he will go to the hotel. Mr. Brown knows him, for he has been there with me. And if he didn't, the boy has a tongue, and can tell him who he is, and what he is after. He wi t do well enough, depend upon it, sister. That is the way I train my boys.' The result proved his theory correct. Charley went in, and drove to the hotel, ordered his horses put up, and saw that they were well taken care of, too, and he took good care of himself. My brother did not arrive for three days; the boat he went around the lakes on, having got aground, and met with several detentions."

I was not at all sorry, after I had learned the result, that I was detained. In fact, I did not fret any, at the time; I knew it was all for the best, as every such thing always is, though we are not always able to see it.' "This also taught me a lesson. .It taught me that children have a natural desire to learn, and that they cannot learn unless they have a teacher. It taught me that the faculties of a child may be developed much younger than is generally supposed. We have infant schools, and all sorts of 'institutions,' to force the facul- ties applicable to the ordinary branches of   MND-CULTURE,      113 school studies, which are pushed like plants in a hot-bed, or forcing-house, to the neglect of all' the qualifications  that make a man or woman of intellect. "There, now, I think I have given you a sufficiently long lecture upon the science of mind culture." "I think I could listen to just such a one, with profit and pleasure, every day, and I hope I shall." "There is no telling what the next may be about. I never premeditate upon my subject. Whatever occurs at the moment, that I think I can explain, or make use of to teach those who are dependent on me for information, I seize upon as the basis of my lecture, if that is a proper term for those little conversations. You were going to the garden-I haveda little work to do. I saw a moth-miller last night, and that is a warning for me to secure my furs and woolens.

Salinda went to fulfill her promise to Frank, to water and feed his hens. -Susan went with - her, and that she might not feel as though she was losing any time, Salinda was to help her wash the dishes.  "But," says she, "had we not better do that first?" "No, because Frank is very regular in his practice of feeding and watering his hens in the middle of the day; and habit with them is as strong as with us. They are looking for it." Salinda found the stme economy of space here as elsewhere.   A   strip five feet wide across the end of the lot was occupied by the  Of  .'.

A barrel of plaster -of Paris stood in one corner, with a little tin dipper, and it was the invariable rule of every occupant of the place, to scatter into the vault a little of the plaster, which absorbed all the ammonia, keeping the place sweet, and rendering the monthly task of emptying the contents into the compost bed, neither unpleasant nor unpro- fitable. That compost bed was a tight vat, occupying the room under the hen-house, and in summer received all the fertilizing iiqu ids from the house, as well as every other scrap of waste, which not only kept the garden rich, but afforded a surplus which was readily purchased and pumped out every week, by a market gardener in the neighborhood.  In the corner appropriated as a hen yard, stood a large plum tree, that never failed to bear a full crop, because the hens prevented the ravages of the curculio.

Over the hen-house was the aviary; and on top of the little room used to store the tools, the lime, plaster, empty beehives, &amp;c. &amp;c., grew the famous water-melons. The whole of these buildings were screened from full view of the house by a row of quince, currant, gooseberry, and rose-bushes. Then came the strawherry bed, with thevines shooting through the covering of tan bark, which not only serves as the best manure, but keeps the fruit-clean. All the vegetables and bushes seemed to be arranged so as to economize room, and make a little spot of ground produce a great deal of food. Next to the house was the grass-plat, and in the centre of that stood a half barrel tub, filled with earth, and planted with cucum- bers. Half the vines will climb a bush, and the other half fall down upon the grass, but are not allowed to run far.   MORE OF THE YAIRD AND GoADEN. 117 - Salinda could not help thinking how much land in and around all cities is wasted-left barren and worthless, that might be made to bear rich products of human food, like this little plat. She noticed that even the earth in the cucumber tub was not allowed to remain idle while waiting for the proper time to re- ceive the seed, and while they were vegetating, but it was made to produce a crop of early radishes. She did not know, but Mr. Savery did, that this productiveness was owing to his liquid manure, and other frequent waterings which he gave the whole ground, with a cheap hand force-pump and hose, with a rose nozzle, which Frank guided while his father worked the pump. "I should really like to know where your cistern is. There is but one pump, and that is at the well." "And yet it draws well or cistern water at your option. You have only to turn this cock this way, and that one this way, and now it will pump well water. Change them back again, and you draw water from the cistern, which is under the grass-plat.

Speaking of the cistern re- minds me that I have got some dishes to wash." "And.

Never put ivory knife-handles into warm water. I use this double tin can. This for the knives, that for the forks." It was like two quart measures-soldered to- gether.

" "Do you use soap in your dish water?" "Seldom. That stone pot is full of ley. If I have ar very greasy dish, that hot water will not clean, I dip it in tha iey, and thus make thegrease into soap. It is a snall natter, but it saves many a sixpence in a year. When the ley gets greasy, I empty it in a tub where  I keep ley, to eat up all the grease and bones  that would otherwise be wasted, or get mouldy or fly-blown, if kept long enough to boil up  for soap. Sometimes it makes itself into ex- cellent soap, without one bit of trouble." "Now, shall I wipe the plates as you wash them?"  "Not yet.

I am very fond of a good cup of black tea, and if not taken very warm, and only moderately strong, with sugar and milk, I think it not only plea- santlyinvigorating, but quite healthy. Liebig, I think it is, says that tea contains nutritious qualities. It is, certainly strengthening and invigorating. It possesses stimulating. and narcotic principles that do not agree with per- sons of hypochondriacal habits, or weak nerves. "H  From 30 to 40 per cent. of tea is soluble in water. And a trifle larger proportion is solu- ble in alcohol. Tea contains considerable tannin; a trace of volatile oil; and the pecu- liar flavor is contained in a resinous substance. This. is much easier dissolved in some varieties than others."   WHAT IS IT?      23 "And hencethe necessity," said Mrs Save ry, "in making black tea that the infusion should stand and boil some minutes; which I percee Susan has somehow neglected to- night."

Mr, Savery, let me change your cup. And you, Salinda, will, as readily as he does, see the difference in flavor." "And economy, too," said Mrs. Savery. "You make that quite a yearly item.

They simply say, that it is not necessary for the health of women and children, and persons of sedentary habits, to eat the same fat pork diet of a hard-working farmer. We are, as you perceive, no vegeta- rians, yet we must allow that the advocates of that system have a great deal of reason and common sense in their arguments. It is a pretty well settled fact in philosophy, that the consumers of swine's flesh, generation after generation, will at length come to partake in some degreeoof the nature of the animal whose flesh they have fed upon.

"Don't you think," said Salinda, " that salt is necessary?" "No more," said Mr. Savery, "than any of the other stimulants. If we eat less salt, we should drink less, and the world would be saved from the disgrace of drunkenness. We are so accustomed to the use of salt, that we never stop to inquire whether it is really use- ful or necessary, or beneficial or otherwise. But we won't stop to discuss this question now. It is enough for the present purpose that it shall induce you to think and inquire for your- self. We listen, Lillie."

"That is the very reason," said Mr. Savery, "why we practice sitting at the table in con- versation after we have done eating. It is not time lost." "The food of our meals should be properly apportioned to the wants of the body. At breakfast we need drinks,  and should eat fruit, and light vegetable food, with but little meat.

One table-spoonful should be a- fill allowance. "When the body is hot and exhausted, bathe the hands and feet and face in cold water, and drink something hot. A little sweetened water, gingered, is excellent. After re- storing the tone of the body to its natural condition, you may have a pleasant, healthful tonic, in a glass of ice water.

But with every indulgence, the power to produce that sensation diminishes, until at length the stomach becomes so accustomed to their use, it would take a whole Niagara of rum to produce the sensation caused by the first glass."

I extract sentiments, and add reflections. What   STIMULANTS AND   CONDIMENTS.    1S[ I read, sometimes serves as a text for a sermon I preach to myself.   Is there anything wrong in what I have iead, or in giving the ideas of others in my own words?" "Not exactly.   I thought that expression about a Niagara of rum, sounded a little ex- travagant ; and I understood you that you had been selecting passages from     Miss Beecher's work, and I did not recollect anything like it. It sounds a good deal more like one of Henry Ward Beecher's strong similes.    Read on." "Those who use stimulating drinks, argue that the taste is a natural one, and call savages and even animals for wit- nesses, and c therefore claim that it is right to indulge the taste; else, they say, why did God implant it in our nature. The murderer might just as well argue that to kill was no sin, because he has a natural propensity for blood. "Stimulants were created for medicine, to cure diseases, not create them.

If they are dry, they should be told the cause of it, and a slight punishment of thirst for eating salt to excess, will not hurt them. It may teach them to eat less. Some persons are constantly eating cloves, cinnamon, mace, orange peel, or some other spicy thing, which only serves to create thirst. No condiment with food can possi- bly do any good. If it stimulates the appetite to eat more, that is not beneficial. A person will soon get so he cannot eat without some stimulant. "In this country the bulk of our food is of a stimulating nature. We consume a vast amount of meat. It is neither economical or healthy. Dyspepsia prevails here to a greater extent than in any other civilized country. Savages, owing to their nature and modes of life, and exposure of the whole body to the atmosphere, can eat meat, even whale blubber, with impunity. We must mix crude vegetables with our meat and fine flour. Of the latter we eat too much. If two-thirds of our wheat was eaten unbolted, we should enjoy better health. At one time the army bread of Eng- land was all made of unbolted wheat, and the soldiers never were so robust and healthy before or since. Those who use wheat grits, that is cracked wheat, are never constipated in the bowels. Oat meal is equally beneficial. It makes very pleasant, healthy bread. It is mostly eaten in gruel, or oat meal porridge. "There is a great lack of economy in most families in clothing; and it is not at all uncommon that health and life are sacrificed to Moloch by fond mothers, through the folly of pride to follow the fashion of dress.

Children often throw off their night covering, because too warm, and then suffer from exposure. This may be guarded against by using night gowns, and never covering them too warm at first. "One person requires more clothes than another, yet all dress nearly alike. Women need thicker clothing than men, as a general thing, yet they almost always dress much thinner. Unless they wear rubbers over their shoes, their feet are as unprotected from damp or cold, as though en- tirely bare. They go out bare-footed, bare-headed, bare-. necked, bare-armed, carrying a dragging weight of sweat cloths suspended from the hips. "Such is woman's winter fashion. ' Men, not only in winter, but in broiling August, encase themselves in thick solid patent-leather boots, impervious to air more than water, and black coat, vest and pantaloons, with a dozen folds of cloth around the neck, the whole topped off with a black hat, as stiff as a stove-pipe, imper- vious to air, and spoiled by the first dash of rain. ' Such is the economy of fashion. "One of the most healthy practices is to wear flannel next the skin. It is a bad conductor of heat, and keeps the body warm. Black should never be worn in the sun in hot weather, because it-conducts the heat to the body. "Whatever is worn next the skin should be often changed. Cleanliness promotes health.

"One of the domestic virtues of rural life is early rising. In cities there is a certain degree of snobbishness that af- fects late hours at everything. These persons are late at church, late at meals, late to bed, and very late in getting out of it. - It is impossible for such a late family to be healthy, and if engaged in business they are rarely prosper- ous. Laying in bed till the sun is two or three hours high, is very poor economy. It is poor economy to sleep by day- -light and work or read by lamplight. No living thing flourishes healthily in darkness or artificial light, except sleeping.

No mother, or mistress of a family, should ask her children or hired help to get up hours before she does herself. Let her own example be a good one. "There is no economy in late hours in bed. "The health of many a person-women in particular--has been ruined for want of judicious exercise. Half the cases of dyspepsia, crooked spine, and nervous debility, come from want of exercise. But exercise should always have an interest for the mind. Walking merely for the exercise of walking, is fatiguingin many cases, where, if the mind was exercised also, no fatue would be felt. Take children out in the field to hunt flowers or fruit-never to hunt bird's nests-that is all wrong-and they rarely grow tired. An invalid, who is fatigued in going up and down stairs, will climb a mountain for the view of the beautiful landscape spread out before him. All females should accustom them- selves to take long walks-walks that have an object and interest for the mind. I knew one person restored to health who thought herself in a decline, just through an interest she took in a little girl, and by following her home to see her sick mother, became so interested that she walked a mile every day upon her mission of mercy and thus saved her own life.

"The fashions of society which coudenln young girls to confinement to books and a sedentary life, are destructive of beauty, grace, health and happiness. "One of the great defects in family education is the ill- breeding of children; that is, a want of proper training of their manners towards superiors, and touching their conduct in all the little proprieties of life. * Be courteous, should be a daily maxim, impressed upon every child's mind. A child that is not courteous to a parent, is not one that meets with love from all. A child never should address a parent like an equal. Every one should behave at home and abroad exactly alike. If chil- dren are allowed to be rude at home, they will be so abroad. The natural disposition of children, is to assume airs of equality with those who are their seniors, and entitled to their respect -and deference. If that disposition is not  checked, they grow pert, overbearing, unamiable, ill-man- nered. Children should be taught gratitude. ' Thank you, ma'am,' costs nothing, but it often sounds as though it was worth something. "Never make rude remarks of another; or laugh at a de- fect of speech, or person, or mock an unfortunate. Rudeness at table is never forgiven. Nothing is more disagreeable to a well bred person. Study to imitate such persons, and you may soon be like them. Their company is always appreciated and courted, while that of a rude person is dreaded and avoided. "A mild tempered, well bred child, no matter how homely the countenance, will always be loved and welcomed among adults or children, while one of rude manners will be ex- cluded--perhaps hated.

It makes of itself an atmosphere of love, that glows and shines upon all the household. "There is no purgatory more irritating to a husband than a scolding wife, or more heart-burning to a wife than a fret- ful husband. In such a house, how can children grow up with happy, cheerful dispositions. They feel a dread, a sort of shock, at the very step of such a parent approaching. I have seen men who never were satisfied with a meal- -some- thing was always wrong. I have seen women who - appa- rently never spoke a good-natured word. Their words were like oil of vitriol-burning every ear they fell upon. Under their influence the husband grows discontented and unhap- py, and avoids home. The children grow up ungovernable, petulant, un miable ; a dread to others, and misery to them- selves. At table, they eat more like pigs than well-behaved children, and if there are strangers in the house, the child- ren, and the thought how they may conduct themselves, are a source of constant anxiety and dread. They are under no control, because they are the victims of a scold.": "Ah, Lillie," said Salinda, "I see you have been getting acquainted with the family of  Royden's, in Father Bright Hopes.

Tell them mildly what will be the consequence, at the first failure; and the second, re- mind them that the offence cannot be repeated with impu- nity; and give a prompt dismissal for the third failure. "A gentleman who had been the torment of his first wife in never coming to his meals when ready, married a second one who was made up of clock-work. She found remon- strance was useless ; but she ascertained that he was a very close calculator of dollars and cents, and she adopted this plan. She opened an account, and charged him with the time of every'member of the family, every minute they were delayed by his neglect. She also charged the deterioration 9f dishes and loss of food by standing till they got cold and sodden; for she had everything put upon the table at the exact moment.  "At the end of a month she laid the bill upon his plate one morning. The man was astounded. His face flashed- fire, but his eye rested upon a smile on the face of his wife. ' Dol't you think,', said she, ' that that is a sum worth sav-. ing?' ' Wife,' said he, ' if you will allow me a credit for every day I am punctual hereafter, equal tot il charge here, I will try to balance this account.' One month from that day she gave him a receipt in full. ' In fact,' said-she, 'I think there is still a small balance in your favor. Here it is.'

'So much,' said he, 'for learning me the value of punctuality.' "It is very bad economy to neglect the opportunity of leisure moments in every household, to cultivate the intel- lect. If possible, there should be an allotment of a portion of every day, where there are children, to make them know one thing more than they knew the day before.

"How many know when they read of the okra plant, what it is, or that its pods furnish one of the richest vegetable 'ubstances that grow, for soup? "Botany; household botany; botany of food-bearing plants, if taught children, would enable many persons to live far more comfortably and healthily than they do in their ignorance. "A better knowledge of botany would promote the cul- tivation of flowers, and offer an endless source of amuse- ment and enjoyment to children; besides promoting their health. It would be a true source of economy. It would use up little waste portions of time.      - "The use and value of money should be early taught to children. One of the most effectual ways to do this is to learn them, as far as may be, to make their own purchases, and to keep an account of the cost of everything purchased for them. This should be footed up every year, and thus a young lady who never earned a dollar, might see how many she had cost. Such an account, too,would serve her as a guide to know how much many useless articles had cost, and how soon a little income could be absorbed in flimsy dresses. "It is poor economy for a woman to spend days and weeks upon a piece of ornamental needlework, and at the same time hire her plain sewing done.

"Cheap articles are not always economical ones. I knew a family who furnished a house with cheap furniture. In three years the carpets had all to be replaced. A set of parlor chairs and sofa had cost twenty-five per cent. of the original price in repairs. - A cheap piano had been sent back, and a new one bought. And so on of -all the articles in the house.. An addition of- fifty per cent. to the first cost, would have been fifty per cent. saved. "No one, whether rich or poor, whether owner or not, has a right to destroy anything that would be useful to another. "' I can do as I please with my own,' is false philosophy. Property is a loan- of Providence that we must account for strictly. If you have an old garment that you do not want, some one else of God's creatures does; and you ihave no right wantonly to destroy it because you are the acknow- ledged owner. "The gift of an old coat may sow the seed that will ripen you a valuable field. An old bed-quilt that you have cast aside, may save a poor woman from a fit of rheumatism; or that pair of old boots, if given to some poor boy instead of being thrown into the fire, might enable him to go to- school, and afterwards perhaps to Congress, or what would be still better, become a useful mechanic. "Economy in all expenditures is not parsimony. A man or woman may be saving, without being niggardly. A per- son may be generous without being lavish. Carelessness of expense is no mark of wealth or respeethHifiy.--- And cer- tainly a mean disposition to cheapen, and beat down the price of goods, or hire cheap labor, is not a mark of a gen- erous mind.   ECONOMY IS?NOT PARlSIXNYr.      1li' "Soqie persons are afraid to say, 'I cannot afford it.' They forget that is the highest recommendation of credit. It is no mark of want of money-it is an evidence of pru- dence in expenditures.  Y! Many a family have been ruined because the husband could fiot say to some extravagant demand of his young wife, who had never learned the value of money, or the ruin of following a foolish fashion, ' I can't afford it.' "To a demand of some poor suffering widow, however, for a trifling assistance, a great many of those most guilty of extravagance, are ready to say, ' I can't afford it.' "No person can afford to be sick, and therefore the art of preserving health should be constantly taught in all families and-schools. It is not generally taught in churches, for of all other places they are the worst ventilated. Many of our school-rooms too, are the hot-beds where the seeds of -disease are planted. Few nurseries are nurseries of health. Bed-rooms are places where the living are en- tombed. Neither body nor mind can enjoy health without a constant contact with pure air. "The best advice in regard to the management of ser- vants and children, is to avoid fault-finding. It never cures the fault. If pleasant words and good advice will not do it, you may as well gtve up. Don't fret whenever you find  that those you have directed to do certain work, have not the judgment of yourself, or have lacked energy, or failed to execute your orders. Inexperienced minds lack fore- thought. They do not lack sensitiveness when chided for a fault. If the chiding is oft repeated--perhaps when least deserved-the ear grows dull and   mind hardened, and instead of reform, a fixed carelessness ensues.  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7637-00000076"/> "8     ECONOMY ILLUSTRATED. "There is economy as well as humanity, in the care of the sick; for with a proper care the patient may recover, instead of lingering through a long confinement. The dis- ease of the mind is often equal to that of the body, and re- quires constant watchfulness and cheerfulness on the part of those in charge. It is well said that recovery depends more upon the nurse than the physician. A good nurse will always keep a room well ventilated, and in neat order. To some minds, it is a cause of deep distress when sick to see everything in confusion. "Never ask a sick person what he or she would like to have to eat; but provide some little delicacy that is suita- ble, and bring it on a waiter covered with a clean napkin, and only such a minute quantity as will be sufficient, and not sicken the weak stomach at the sight of so much that cannot be eaten. i"There is nothing more valuable in a sick-room than chloride of lime. It keeps the atmosphere healthy, even in such horrid diseases as the small-pox. "For a convenient cheap disinfector, coffee is the most readily used and quick in its action, and rarely offensive to any one.- Put a few grains upon any hot iron, and roast it in the room from which you wish to remove the effluvia. In a moment you will smell nothing but the coffee. Cop- peras, dissolved and sprinkled about is a good disinfector. Care must be taken not to let it fall upon white cloth, as it makes a permanent stain. Acids- are used for disinfectors, but the smell to some persons is disagreeable.

"I shall only mention two or three Specifics, and that only because but little known. "In small-pox, the pits can be entirely prevented, by cov- ering the pustules as fast as they break, with a coating of collodian, a liquid cuticle, sold at all the drug shops. In malignant erysipelas, a poultice of cranberries will effect a cure when all other remedies fail. "In all bowel complaints, the only certain remedy, that is worthy the name of -specific, is a tea made of the bark of the sweet gum tree (Liquid Jinber), that grows all over the United States, south of latitude 41. It is an invaluable medicine for children. "But the best medicine, and the best nurse in the world, is the one that prevents rather than cures sickness. "Under the head of preventives, for they are promoters of health, I would rank family amusements. These, where well conducted, prepare the body and mind for the actual duties of life. Some children need amusement as much as they need food. If every father would play cards with his son, and at the same time: teach him the evils of gambling, and the contempt of all respectable people for such an oc- cupation, the gambling trade would soon cease to exist. "But I do not by any means recommend card-playing. It is an idle game, from which nothing of practical utility is to be learned. Many other games belong to the same category Some, however, that appear childish to a man, may be- very properly indulged in by children.

"Dancing for amusement, and not for dissipation, should not be placed under the ban of the strictest moralist. "Singing for amusement should be encouraged, and ex- tensively practiced by all families. So should practice upon musical instruments. "In-door amusements for children-home plays-induce- ments to spend the evenings at home-should be constantly studied by every parent. The most feasible, and the one which should be kept the most prominent, is family read- ing, and family lectures, where all are made to feel an in- terest in the reader, or speaker, or his subject. "A great deal of useful labor may be done in every family, not as labor, but as a source of amusement, by which the mind is employed. Such is the cultivation of a garden. 'Few children, who have become accustomed to tending a garden, would be willing to dispense with it, be- cause it is their amusement. It is their happiness to see the flowers and fruit grow ; and they show them to their com- panions with as much satisfaction as the builder of a ship would show his work to a company of merchants. "In all things encourage your children to amuse them- selves with something useful; but if they strike upon a vein of mirth, or something ridiculous, do not restrain their laughter. Laugh and grow fat, is a meaning proverb. Laughter expands the lungs and promotes health. Do not tell a child that it is wicked to laugh.

Depend upon it, she will ape the lady soon enough without any hot-house cultivation of the faculty of imitation. "One of the early habits that should be taught children, is to take care of their own clothes; and boy or girl, as soon as big enough, should learn to mend, and the value of that old adage, ' a stitch in time saves nine.'" "There is another thing that children should learn," said Lillie, closing her book, and rising, "and that is the habit which I have acquired from the good example of my parents, ot to continue my reading till I tire out mydi- ence, or until it is past our usual hour of re- tirement., It is bed-time.. You must forgive me one and all if I have trespassed upon good breeding, in my anxiety to finish in one even- ing, what has occupied me a month in prepar- ing." Mr. Savery expressed his high satisfaction at her successful production, and Salinda de- clared that she had learned more than she ever did before from any lecturer of the many she had listened to.

"Now, sister Lillie, that is all verygood, so far as it goes; but only think how much bet- ter it would be if it was printed in a nice book, which might be read by thousands in all coming years." That idea embodied a thought.  "It is worth thinking about," said Mrs. Savery. It is worth thinking about, whether the readers of this book are satisfied; and, if like Salinda, they think they have learned more than from the discourse of a lecturer of much higher pretensions than this school-girl, they should also think to whom they are indebted for it. Primarily, to be sure, to the writer, but certainly to Frank Savery; for it is owing to his suggestion of "how  much better it would be," that it is here printed in this nice book, to be read by whole generations of such good children as Salinda, Lillie and Frank.

By special invitation she spent the forenoon in the kitchen. Susan was preparing food for Sunday, so as to avoid cooking as far as possi- ble. With that view she made a large, plain rice-pudding. It was a common-sized milk- pan full.

"No; that I intend to do myself, if you and she are willing." "Certainly, with all my heart; and I can tell you everything while I am at work just as well. I always put raisins in. rice-puddings, because they add a nice flavor. I generally cut them, and put them in soak over night, or a few hours before using; but you must be careful to use the water as well as fruit. I put my cinnamon in soak with the raisins, as I always use whole sticks, and if it is put in the rice dry it does not always give up all the strength. I soak my rice soft, before I mix it with the milk. It should bake slowly about two hours." "What are you soaking this meat for?" "That is the edge bone of the round-the most economical piece of meat in the whole beef. I shall boil that directly, till it is nice and tender, and in the liquor I shall put all that pan of roast meat bones, which I have been saving all the week, and add my vege- tables, and make such a nice pot of soup-and, as you see, all for nothing.

This I heat up to- morrow in a clean tin kettle. "The meat I shall take out, and while it is wet, I sprinkle it all over with pulverized cracker or rusk bread, with whatever season- ing is -agreeable to the family. Some use gar- lie or onions, and various herbs. We prefer everything plain. I use a little salt, pepper, thyme, and afterwards garnish with parsley. This meat I put in a dish in a hot oven, just long enough to brown the outside. You will say to-morrow that it- is very nice, and quite as good as though it was hot.

While these arrangements were going on in the kitchen, preparatory to Sunday, Frank was as busy as a bee in the garden, and Lillie, with her long coarse apron, and snug cap, was all over the house, sweeping and dusting, and "setting things to rights." Mrs. Savery was industriously engaged upon a summer coat for her husband, for it was his boast that he had never worn one made by any other hands since he was married, and that no man went neater dressed than himself. After dinner, Mr. Savery said to his wife, "What time shall we start? I told Henry to bring the wagon round at two o'clock. Will you all be ready?" Mrs. Savery thought he had better take the girls and Frank, and leave her, she had so much to do. "'That is the very reason why you should go. There is nothing that enables us to do so much as an occasional day of rest-a little recreation, or relaxation from labor."

This he was pleased to give her an opportunity to do, because, said he, "I look upon it as a part of the education of a girl that never should be overlooked, though it generally is, that she should learn horse- manship. Every one should be taught how, so that upon emergency, if not for pleasure, she could take charge of a horse, or a-pair." "My sister Clara, then, suits your ideas ex- actly," said Mrs. Savery.

You have the very first requisite for it." "What is that?" "A calm temper, and freedom from that nervous impatience which runs out to the very finger ends of some people, and keeps them constantly twitching at the reins, or using the whip, or speaking sharply to urge the horse forward. Such driving will spoil any horse. The temper of the driver always seems to me to affect the horse. If one is gentle, the other is.

There is another horse on the road, and he hears him coming round the bend, and is not disposed to be passed. Now you hear what he heard at first." "Oh, will he want to run to keep ahead?" said Salinda, with a slight suspicion that her "  horsemanship might be insufficient in a race. "Not unless you wish .him. He is ready for a word of command.

A man doing a business cer- tainly not worth over two thousand dollars a year-a mere mechanic-and a hard-working, honest mechanic, too-for that is Doolittle's character, if it is not his name-to buy a fifteen hundred dollar carriage and horses, just to gratify his weak-minded, vain wife, and badly- educated, proud daughters-the thought is sickening.

It is -not likely that the load of jewel-bediz- zened pride that swept by in their velvet-cush- ioned, easy carriage, as they looked out from the cloud of silks and laces, upon the occu- pants of that humble wagon, had an idea that the time would ever come to them again, when they would be obliged to travel in so Dmean a conveyance, as a plain one-horse buggy.

It is enough to make any one feel faint, who knows what good society is." Good society!! Heaven bless us! Five years ago, the Doolittle family would have been very glad to ride in as good a wagon with a borrowed horse. Now they rolled away in a very atmosphere of their own, that shut out all reminiscences of scenes of early life and old acquaintances. Doolittle himself was an honest, hard-work- ing mechanic, but lacking that stability of mind which would have enabled him to resist the outside pressure of a weak-minded, proud woman, who was bringing up her children in, idleness and frivolity, he had been forced to abandon a comfortable country home, for a fashionable city residence and an expensive mode of living, that, notwithstanding his large increase of business wojd lead him to one   TALK ON THE ROAD.  inevitable result-one that sooner or later overtakes every one who lives beyond his income.

Behind -the chimney is a great kitchen, with its enormous fire-place and oven. At one end of the kitchen is the stairway, and passage to the "end door," and a buttery; and at the other end is a bed-room.

Then a turn of the wheel and a catch tightens and holds it so. Beyond the clothes yard and on a lower level lies the garden. A drain from the house carries all the waste water to a tank in the garden, and every rain that falls washes any little fertilizing matter on or about the house, down to the garden, where it will do good. The house, as all country houses should do, when it is feasible, fronts the north.

These were all planted by- Mr. Whitlock, as he said, for the public. His children, or grand-children would see the benefit of them, and how much they would be valued. Not only his children, but himself lived to see many a panting horse reined up in the pleas- ant shade of some of those trees, to recuperate strength for a drive over a long sunny road. Many a tired traveller, no doubt, sent up his thank-offering for the refreshing luxury of that way-side fruit. Planting shade-trees and fruit-trees by the. wayside, ought to be inculcated as a Christian duty. On the east side of the house commenced the farm buildings. The first was a neat wagon-house next the road, two-stories high, the upper loft a seed-room, and place to store wool and. various other things. From the   PARK FA-BUILDINGS.   1" wagon-house extended a long shed, where dry wood was always stored. In one end was a room called the shop, contaning a carpenter's bench and tools, a portable forge, and a set of tools for mending harness, or saving a shilling by a stitch in time in a pair of shoes. At the other end was a room with a kettle set in an arch, which was used for making soap, trying out fat, and cooking food for the pigs, which occupied a pen on the other side of the :iuild- ing, communicating with the barn-yard beyond, or with the little orchard, where they were allowed to run, except when the fruit was ripe and falling from the trees. Con- nected with the pig-pen was the hen-house, and beyond that a large yard in which they could be shut whenever it was desirable to keep them out of the garden. One side of the poultry-yard was formed by the corn-crib, with an opening for them under the building, so that every grain that fell was not wasted, "4 but was picked up by some sharp-eyed biddy, ". always watching for a chance grain. :'If you keep hens," said Mr. Whitlock, "under the crib, you will not keep rats or 8*  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7637-00000091"/> 178    ECONOMY ILLUST'ATED. mice. It is only a question of which is most profitable." The barn was a pattern of convenience. The milking-yard was between the wood-shed and barn. The stable-yard on the softh side, the stables occupying a basement. A rise of ground on the north side, gave a roadway, by a slight inclined plane, -to the second story of the barn. When a load of hay was driven in, the driver without any assistance, could hitch a tackle-block to the wagon-bed, and detach his team and hitch them to the fall, and start them forward, lifting the whole load, which then swung round by a crane over the great bay, when by a simple contrivance the ropes on one side unhooked, and down dropped the whole load. In this way, 'm fifteen minutes, he could unload and' start out for another. Thus a hundred tons could be put under shel- ter without any of the hard work and heavy expense of pitching and: stowing away.

Strawherries and sugar, strawherries and cream, strawherries and such nice cool milk, for I forgot to mention the ice-house, one of the luxuries and economies of every farm.

"The enjoyment of eating is greatly owing to surrounding circumstances; I don't think I could relish my food as well, where I knew that neatness never had an abiding-place.

It was the evidence of good breeding, often found under the roughest exteriors upon American farms. Sam Whitlock the farmer, would be, always will be, Samuel Whitlock the gentleman born, gentleman bred, gentleman in all that mnakes the character. He had in his young days fixed his heart upon a girl who- as she grew up; could not understand that character, and luckily for him, concluded to break her troth, since which he had fallen into habits of indo- lence, as regards the exterior appearance of a gentleman. Salinda had unconsciously awak- ened that feeling which prompts a man to look to personal appearance, and the quick eye of his mother, as well as T illie, saw it, and felt grateful to the object. She thought and said, "You have done a sight of good." Just as they were going out to the wagon, the Doolittle carriage was comiing down the road. Sam fairly outdid his nature,- in the little courtesies of the-occasion. Was there a little natural feeling, to let Miss Triphenia see that he was not. utterly disconsolate? Was   THE DOOLITTLES AT THE FARM.  187 there on the part of Salinda, a little desire to  assist him, even -at the risk of being called, as she was called, "the shameless tlirt."  The girls would have preferred to dash by with a simple nod of recognition, but their-mother either felt guilty of such rudeness, and order- ed the driver to rein up, or else she saw the baskets of tempting strawherries, and was prompted to the act by a spirit of greediness. Let us hope it was not the latter. A stranger might have thought the new-comers were the warmest friends of the family, so enthusiastic was their greeting. They were so delighted to have the opportunity of meeting their old friends and neighbors all together. The girls complimented Salinda upon her skill in driv- ing, it was "such an accomplishment.." "If we had such a lovely little snug carry- all, and only one horse-but pa would have two--we should certainly learn to drive." How quick the wicked remarks made as they drove past, had passed into the ocean of forgetflness. Those remarks were to the backs, and these to the faces -of those they talked about.

George Alexander Waltingham in his heart felt that Triphenia:was a fool to throw away such a man, and such a prospect of being the mistress of ahouse and farm like this for a gam- bler. He almost spoke the word, so strongly he thought of it. But he covered up his thoughts with his supercilious actidns, which he thought would pass well in the present *company, as evidence of high breeding. Ex- - cept with a fraction of the company, he was very much mistaken.  The others thought him just what hie was-anadventurer, a fop, a libertine.

Of course Mrs. Savery and Lillie were includ- ed in the invitation, though Kitty said she hoped " that stuck-up school-girl would have sense enough not to come." The truthwas, that she felt herself the foil that added lustre to Lillie's diamonds of a cultivated mind, whenever they were brought into contrast.

The Visit to the Doolittles. NOT long after the above events, Mrs. Savery, Salinda, and Lillie, went to make their visit to the Doolittles. Of course they were received with demonstrations of great delight. The door was opened by the coachman, gardener, man of all work, and good at none-a useless appendage and foolish expense to such a family. He was attending to this duty, as Mrs. Doolittle apologized, because both of their chamber girls had suddenly left. "They were very impertinent, asking me for their wages, time after time, instead of waiting t for me to give it them when it was convenient; and, finally,this morning they told Doolittle about it, and he, the fool, gave them the money, and no quicker than they got it, they both packed up and cleared out. I do wish men would attend to their own business, and - /   THE DOOLITTLES AT HOME.   199 not undertake to manage our household affairs. However, I am glad they are gone, for they had got to be quite worthless. You can see that by the looks of the-house." Indeed itvas easy to see that somebody was quite worthless about the house. The parlors were elegantly furnished, so far as costly frail furniture could make elegance, and that was all. There was scarcely a chair or sofa that was not broken or scratched, or torn, and every crevice showed the worthlessness of those-whose business it had been to keep the furniture free of dust. Salinda counted five holes in the lace curtains, punched by dirty fingers. Perhaps they had been made by marble fingers, for several had been broken from the statuettes which ornamented the mantels. There were several grease spots ;upon the carpet, one of which bore unmistakable evidence of a recent fall of bread and butter. The piano was out of tune, because the " children will keep thump- - ing at it." In short, the whole house was out of tune. About an hour after the arrival of their guests, the young ladies" sailed down stairs, with a profusion of fancy gauze, silk,                     &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7637-00000102"/> 200  K .: ECONOMY ILLUSTRATED. tlace, ribbons, and jewelry, and their hair in  such afriz as might astonish, if not frighten, one of the aborigines of the American forest. There was no need, of half the lying excuses for their late appearance ; such as having so much work to do, in consequence of the departure of those ungrateful girls, and quite forgetting how late it was, and how punctual Mrs. Savery always is, and how they had to dress each other's hair. Salinda might have believed the latter, as it was impossible for either to make - such a fright of herself alone, if she ]lad not ! caught a glimpse of a well-known French hair- dresser, as he went down stairs.  - Of course the girls could not show their pro- ficiency iq, music, because thei piano was, out / of tune. ' Lilhe said slyly, that she never knew it otherwise. It was a standing excuse.- If it ever happened'to be in order, the girls always had c horrid colds.'    -- Salinda proposed to look at the garden. They could not refuse, though' it was ina  :  "shocking condition." In that they spoke the toth:' But 'the most shocking- part of it was,  that it was filled with expensive shrubs-:and    flowers, to such a degree that Shere was no i room for fruit, or anything beyond a fewroses, of any practical use. Tender plants were choked with grass and weeds, or trampled on :by careless feet, and those of larger growth bore marks of having officiated in place of a clothes-line, and the paths were whitened with "dried soap-suds. Grease, dirt, old rags, broken crockery, scraps of meat, and cooking utensils made up a slut's museum around the back basement door and windows. The full view was hidden from the -garden by an untrimmed, and of course un- productive, grape-vine, that shut out the sun from the very place where it was most needed to dry up the moisture and preventianasma, Just as the party returned to- t'e house, there was a tearing ring at the door-bell, and a thundering knock at the basement door at the same time. As-it was doubtful which to go to first, the man took a middle course and went to neither. Directly those outside grew impatient, and began kicking the doors as though they would knock them down or force them open.  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7637-00000103"/> a02    ECONOMY ILLUSTRATED. "Why don't that lazy fellow -go to the door?" said one -of the girls, "It is really provoking."  Why did she not herself open it when she was within three steps when the bell rang. It would have compromised her dignity. At length the lower door was opened, and by the noise, a mad bull came in, stamping with fury. "I'll- tear your eyes out, you old black nigger, if you don't open the door next time when I am starved. Where is Ned? If he's got in .fimt, I'll lick him." Up stairs he went to ascertain that fact. No one else being likely to let in master Neddy, Mrs. Doolittle suggested to Kitty that she might attend to it, just this once. She went off muttering about having to do ser- vant's work. Master Ned came in uproari- ous, but better-natured than his fighting brother Welt-the short name of Wellington. Perhaps his fighting character was partly owing to his name. Character is often influ- enced by a slighter circumstance. 'Oh, you're so dressed up you couldn't come to the door, eh 2 I'll pay you for it some "a   TE BOYS AT  OWm.    203, time, M[iss Kitty.

"I)o hush, Ned, you don't know who is in the parlor."  "I don't want to know. Old Whiskerandos, I s'pose; he's here all the time. I wish Phene 'would have him and done with it." Mrs. Doolittle closed her ears to this inter- esting conversation, under the impression pro- bably that by so doing she would close those of her visitors. Either of his sisters could have wrung Ned's neck, without any compunctions of conscience. Now another actor, in the person of the mad bull, came tearing up the basement stails, and "pitched in to give Ned a licking because he got in first, and to serve Kitty in the same way for letting him in. "He bet me his cap that he would get home first, and get in and up to the parlor door; and he cheated; he had no business to come in this way when I thoughlt he was going to  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7637-00000104"/> 204    EcoNOMY ILLUnSTRXTED. t'other door, and then we could have a fair race up stairs. But I' have the cap any- how." At that he went at him to get the cap, and down they both went in the hall in a regular bull-dog, rough-and-tumble fight. Mrs. Doo- little still oblivious. Kitty had returned with a face that needed no rose pink. It was -burning red, and she bit her lip to keep in the angry words that would have poured out if they had not been restrained by the company of strangers. "Oh dear, what is that?" exclaimed Mrs. Doolittle, as a crash that jarred the house, came from the field of combat in the hall. Instinctively all rushed out to see. A niche had been constructed in the wall at the foot of the stairs for a piece of statuary. Unfortu- nately it was too shallow to hold a plaster-cast of some mythological goddess that the young ladies had purchased, because "the place looked so naked without something." Somehow in the scuffle, this had been jarred so that it toppled over, and down it came upon a table, made more for ornament than use,   INTERESTING SCENE.    205 upon which stood a Chinese vase of flowers. The whole was a wreck together. At least fifty dollars had gone into the maelstrom that was swallowing up poor Doolittle's property. The boys perfectly understood that ' discre- tion was the better part of valor," and made a \ hasty retreat. The girls raged-they lost their discretion. Their mother was angry enough to have torn the boys like a tiger, but finally consoled herself for all the loss, with the thought that that nude figure had been got rid of, because "she never thought it looked decent."  Mrs. Doolittle was one -of those admirers of statuary, who think it should be dressed in calico frocks, or at least wear aprons. In the midst of the confusion, and just as Tri- phenia had accused her mother of moving the statue forward on purpose to have it fall, and she was giving some angry retort, the door- bell rung, and before orders of " not at home'. could be given, the man, who with the cook, had both come upon the scene of action, open- ed the door, and in walked Mr. George Alex- ander Waltringham.

Perhaps it was owing to the oily nature of the gentleman, that he produced the same effect upon the turbulence of the waves that were raging but a moment before in this family. The new comer was not at all disconcerted; in fact he was rather inclined to joke at the accident, which he did not look upon as very serious,-in fact he had rather expected it; as he had noticed the insecurity of the thing, which a slight jar might bring down. He forgot to add that he had purposely moved it forward with that view, looking upon it as he did, as such an abortion that it was no harm to work its destruction. It is but right to do him the justice to say, that he did not anticipate the other damage- the table had been placed; under the niche sub- sequently, by somebody, or rather "nobody," that omnipresent genius of mischief, who was constantly putting things out of place in this house. The party left the servants to clear away the debris, and retired to the parlor in such a pleasant mood of lively conversation, that   BEHND THE SCENES.    207 Salinda could only compare it to the sudden outhurst of the sun from dark clouds that a moment before had shot forth forked light- ning. In handling some of the things, Salinda dis- covered that she had soiled her hands, and whispered Kitty to go up to her room with her, where she could wash them. It was an unadvised admission behind the scenes of out- side appearances. "Such a room," she said to Lillie that night in their own neat apartment, "I never saw before-I hope never to see again. The bed looked like a pig's nest; I am sure it had not been made for a week, and the sheets and pillow-cases were fairly black. Every vessel was full of dirty slops, and the only way that I could wash my hands was by Kitty pouring water out of a broken pitcher, while I held them over a flower-pot that seemed grateful for the accidental watering. The whole room looked like the drift of an inundation of some muddy river. Shoes and shifts; books and bonnets; parasols and petticoats; stocings and staylace; tape and towels;- slippers and  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7637-00000106"/> ECONOMY ILLUSTRATED. slops; lay about in one grand mixture. The furniture had been costly, if not rich; now there was not a whole chair among half a dozen, and all were loaded with dresses, or some of the paraphernalia of a lady's dressing chamber. The rosewood dressing table stood upon three legs; the sofa seat was broken down in the springs, and the feet had lost the cas- tors, and torn the Turkey carpet. The lace window-curtains were yellow, and covered with dust and cobwebs. But that was no worse than the parlor. Did you notice the festoons the spiders had made all along the cornice over the window ?" " Yes, and the dust among the untouched books on the centre table. It would make my mother crazy." As Salinda. returned to the parlor, there was a commotion in the tea-room. Ned was ordering the cook, with a few of his young gentleman oaths, to give him something from the table to eat, before the company came in. She heard him say: "I will have some-- they'll eat it all up-I'm hungry-I won't wait-I'll steal it all, and tell my mother that   you eat it, and make her discharge you, if you don't give me some, you blasted old-"- The balance of the sentence was interrupted by a scream from the cook. It was a custard in an elegant cut-glass dish that the boys cov- eted. Bread, and butter, and cake would not satisfy them. Cook had set the dish on the top shelf of the china closet, to keep it out of their way. While Ned was trying to coax or scold the cook into gratifying his appetite, his brother, the mad bull, like his prototype in a crockery store, had got into the china closet, and climbed up the shelves, and got his hanrd on the coveted article. It is almost needless to say, that just as he sang out, "Hurrah, Ned, I've got it," he did get it.  His foot slipped, and down he came, dish and all, with the contents in his face and all over his clothes, and the dish in fragments on the floor. "I do wonder," said Mrs. Doolittle, " what that careless wench has, broken now. I shall take it out of her wages, she may rest assured of that." To prevent any one else going to see, she said, "sit still, don't mind it; you know one &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7637-00000107"/> 210   : ECONOMY ILLUSTRATED. broken dish always has another just behind it, till fate gets the three." Kitty lacked the discreetness of her mother and sister. She had turned off as she came down stairs, ", to see what the muss was ;" and now came in and told the whole story. Her mother was sure it was all the cook's fault. "She is always having a difficulty with them boys. I dare say if she had given them anything in the world to eat, they would have. gone away as quiet as lambs to their play. I declare I must get a new woman-I can't stand it." What good would it do to get a new one a She had done the same thing a dozen times, with the same results. If she could have got a new system  of family government, and brought her children under a wholesome dis- cipline, and-taught them subordination, she would have saved herself from constant scenes of vexation and loss, and then the Doolittle boys would not have been the terror of their schoolmates, and the hated pests of thI -whole neighborhood.

The table was loaded with cut-glass and china, costly and; friagile. But the sweet home-made bread and plain cakes were not there. Their place was occupied by costly knick-knackeries from the French baker's-real health-destroyers. The tea was the only home-made thing, and that was weak and smoky, and when it was too late to remedy the defect, it was found that "nobody " had drank up all the milk. Mrs. Doolittle said, "she would warrant it was John, the great hog." Tillie did not say she would warrant it was not; but from where she sat, she could see the face of a boy peeping into the window through the grape-vine, upon whose lips the stolen milk had left its mark. It was a costly, but an unsatisfactory meal. The cakes looked as though they were made for ornament and not use, and so they were generally refused. It was not the first- time they had done service in the same way. The rich sweetmeats were not half as good or as hea-lthy as Mrs. Whitlock's strawherries.

"It is certainly very bad economy; besides being extremely vexatious; but Mrs. Doo- little appears to be used to it; don't you think, Mrs. Savery, that she stands it remark- ably well?

He supposed it was the girls that she meant, for she was talking with them, and he thought; "What, has it come to this? must I tie up my daughters, for their mother to wreak her ven- geance upon, for some  trifling dispute or dis- agreement?

What did he do? i- Just what a- thousand others have before, whose home held no magnet, like that of the Saverys, to draw them within its portals, and shield them from the corrupting association of evil companions. Poor Doolittle! He had come home late and tired, because it had been hinted to him that his presence with company would not be agreeable. Such a man trembles as he lays his hand upon his own door-latch, after- a hard day's work, and shrinks back from what he hears within. He hesitated, and mentally said, "Oh, God, -is this home " then turned away and walked back around the corner, and entered one of those ever invitingly open doors, where a man whose face is one constant winning smile, stood before his customers, tempting them to buy some of his colored fluids, which they knew by experience would give them oblivion of the discomforts of their home, or eke them forgetful of their own folly, or reckless of some indiscretion commit- ted or contemplated, or careless of the want   DRINKING, A-ND ITS EFFECT.  215 of money to provide home comforts, which in such places as this are foolishy wasted. Doolittle needed no coaxing. 'He took the draught eagerly, and it was a large one, and   / then went and sat down in a-dark corner and laid his head upon a table and enjoyed yes, that is the word, enjoyed the oblivion produced by a drunken sleep. He  had long been a hard drinking man, but: this was the first time that he had ever been drunk,-drunk in a public bar-room. He slept on unnoticed, as had a hundred others before him in the same corner. It is the effect, the least injurious effect, of drink- ing, upon some mnen. Some -are loquacious; some are argumentative and religious; some are lascivious; some are excessively foolish; some are brutal, beastly, ugly, quarrelsome, wicked, combatative, murderous. Others are simply stupid. That was the effect produced upon Doolittle. He waked at length, as many persons have awaked from a state. of insensi- bility, by the sound of their ownlname. Close by where he sat, was a thin board partition. Somebody on the other side had  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7637-00000110"/> 216    ECONOMY ILLUSTRATED. forgotten that walls have ears. If they had not, Doolittle had, and when he heard his own name he opened them. His stupor had passed off, and his hearing faculties were quick. He distinguished one of the voices-as that of Wal- tringham. The other he did not know, but the person was pressing him for a debt, which in the fashionable parlance of perverted lan- guage, is cabled "a' debt of honor." If it is, it is honor among thieves, for gambling and steal- ing are both in one category, in the opinion of those who practice neither. "Now, see here," said Waltringham to his companion, "you just keep easy a little while, and I shall make a raise. See if I don't. I understand the rpes. I am just now stock- ing the cards., I shall be sure to hold a hand that will win.' "Well, old fellow, I should like to know how. Show me your hand. Is it all honors?" "Yes, trumps at that. The bullet, king, queend knave." There could be no mistake about the latter. Every inch a knave. "Well, how are you going to play them?

Doolittle ventured to look up. He had out- slept all the company. It was after eleven o'clock. The bar-keeper was dozing outside the door, waiting for twelve o'clock, when he would shut up. Doolittle drew up still closer to the partition. There was a large knot hole, covered by a piece of paper, just by his ear. He cut this away with his pocket knife and every low spoken word came through dis- tinctly. "You know old Doolittle, said Waltringham -very well, his daughter is just one of the finest animals you ever saw trotted outs. She is a real 2. 40 nag. She will win anywhere.

Besides, it will cost a pile to keep such a blooded animal."  Oh, never fear that. The old man has got, plenty of fodder, if he has not plenty of money.

Had she known all that her hus- band knew, she would have been still more wretched; for the marriage of Triphenia with a Southern planter was to be to her a crown- ing glory. The girls had gone off to their room ; that room so graphically described by Salinda; and there they were having a pretty quarrel be-  tween themselves. Triphenia was mad because Kitty had brought Salinda up thereeto see all the dirt and confusion, and waste, and discomfort of such an apartment.

The " scene" that Doolittle took a part in the next morning, was not "first exhibited in that theatre for the only time."

She declared it was all a conspiracy to prevent her marriage, but it came too late. She did not ask any favors of her father-par- ticularly of such a father." "Then you can take your 'gentleman' and leave your father and his house as soon as you please. You are no longer a daughter of mine."

He never before was a stern man, but a revolution had occurred in his character, such as we sometimes see depicted upon the stage; so sudden, so cormplete:that the actor seems to be playing another part. -Doolittle was not acting a part-his was an original character, which might be acted to advantage, for others to::udy.

Mrs. Doolittle, not  being able to find him at the shop after send- ing there repeatedly, had made up her mind that he was away somewhere drunk, and hav- ing thus determined, she was not to be con- vinced by the palpable evidence of her senses, when he returned in the evening, that he was. strictly sober. He suffered her to go on with?- her invectives, and charges of bringing ruin upon the family by his improvidence and laziness, thinking perhaps that the best way was, when the flood-gates were opened, -to allow the current to flow until the pond should run out. This may be good policy where the -:: : stream comes from a small head, but quite the contrary where it flows from such. an exhaust- less source as that which supplies the cataract of Niagara.

Kitty was absent so long that it was evident that the messenger was not one that brought news of death or any other terrible calamity, though it was one that told of ruined hopes and blasted ambition--that the wild day- dreams of a romantic girl had all been crush- ed, and herself humbled at a single blow. It was not a messenger from Triphenia, it was Triphenia   herself; humbled, broken dowFn 8subied, and weeping like a child. In '   H:, the whole of her life had been re- Fieeld, and her errors had rushed back upon her heart, and, like her father, for in many cases she was like him, she had seen what were her errors, and had determined tor begin a new course of life. She fell upon Kitty's neck as she opened the door, and then for the first time during all the agony of the twenty- four hours, since the commencement of -the quarrel, her fountains of tears were unlocked,; and poured forth their streams, greatly to the  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7637-00000122"/> 240    ECONOMY ILLUSTRATED. relief of a heart that until then seemed on fire. As soon as she could speak, she begged Kitty to hide her from her angry father-her Imother she knew would storm awhile, but for that she cared nothing; her father "if sober," she said, she could never meet him-she had injured him too deeply to hope for forgiveness. Oh I sister, since you forgive me, hide me, at least for to-night, and don't let any one know that I am here."     x To this Kitty acceded, and while Triphenia went quietly up to their room, she went back to tell- her mother that she had heard from her sister, and that she was in a friend: house safe and well, and that her mother shbold-?see her in the-' morning. She then drew her father away, as she said, to give him some supper, but in reality to pave the way for a reconcili- ation with Triphenia. -Doolittle was;!aman-of a kind  sition, and loved his children, and loved ei.:ares- ses, arid therefore said yes, without an effort, when Kitty put her arms around: hi neck and said,"father, you will forgive her?"Her heart - leapt with joy to hear that little word, " yes."   A FATHER';S FORGIVENESS   241 "Oh come then, now, for she is so miserable" -and she took him by the arm, without regarding his question " where?" and led him up to her chamber. That "; there is a time for all things," was partly proved by the fact that there is a time for penitence. Then was the time for Tri- phenia. She fell upon her father's neck, a subdued, penitent child. All the errors of her former conduct seemed to have concen- trated upon her mind, and to be brought by. the one great error of her stubborn temper to a culminating point, and from that she had resolved that change, improvement, and some- thing better should arise. In this she was greatly assisted by her father's ready forgive- ness of her fault, but still more from the fact that he had determined never to touch another drop of intoxicating liquor. "In this," said he, '" my girls, I need all my own strength, and all, that you can lend me. I have another severe trial for you, and to accomplish it in peace I shall also need your aid.

"But shall not be any more. If you have been unfortunate, and find it best to return to the old place, you never shall say again that we were stubborn and prevented it, and I hope mother will be reasonable. Have you told her?"' "Not yet; but I will, now that I have got somebody to help me. Shall I do it to-night?." "Yes, now; the sooner the better; let's have it over with. Don't you say so, sister?" "Certainly; and then- we shall be better prepared for our task to-morrow."' Poor girls, they little knew what that task was to be. Although now is generally the best time, it was not so in this case.

"It would have been better to have waited until morning, before breaking the news to her;" that is, so said they all, after the result was known. Who knows? Better say, all is for the best, however inscrutable. "I want," said Doolittle, " to have a little talk with you about moving to the country." "Well, I don't want to hear anything about it. I have told you often enough never to speak to me again on the subject. When I am dead you may carry me, not before; I tell you that, once for all, and let that be the end of it." "But it can't be the end of it; we have got to move from here; this house and furniture has got to be sold to pay my debts. I have failed."

Six Months on Time's Railroad-Talk of Marriage- Sensi- ble'Conclusion to get ready first-Preparation for House- keeping-The New House-A Pleasant Surprise. How rapidly six months went down the inclined plane of Time's railroad, carrying along the daily trains of cars freighted with hopes, anticipations, prospects of things to happen before the train reaches the final ter- mination; and how anxiously had those wait- ing at the roadside stations, watched each day for the one that would bring the culmination of the hope nearest the heart. Charley Goodman was among those watch- ing and waiting. Yet he was not impatient, for reason told him that in no six months of Salinda's life, had she travelled so fast upon the road of improvement that lifts the civil- ized, cultivated, educated woman, above one bred in savage life, or reared in health-destroy- ing indolence of families who suppose them- selves the very acme of Christian civilization.  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7637-00000126"/> 248    ECONOMY0 ILLUSTRATED. "Six months," said he to her one evening, "of my probation have passed. It is the first period that you set-' six months or a year '- those were the words; do-you intend to keep me waiting for the longest period?" "Why, Charley, the time has gone so rap- idly, that I can -hardly realize that so many months of my life have been- sped away never to return. But there is a lesson in that, well worthy of thought--careful, serious thought-- it should teach us the economy of time.- To look back, I cannot see where I have wasted mine, but to look forward it seems as though I should be able to accomplish a great deal more in the next six months than I have in the past. I do hope they will be as happy ones to me as the past have been. And one of' the most happy of all the circumstances connected with them, is, that I am so much better fitted - to'be your wife than I was before." "Then when will you be that coveted object ." "You remember the promise-' six months or a year'-I shall leave it to you to decide, after 1 state a few circumstances. Neither of   hITLGg OFy eaGmE.     49 us having previously determined upon our marriage at this time, neither are prepared; and I have not been six months- studying economy, without learning what a waste of time it would be to get married before we are prepared. Some romance reading young girls, seem to think that it would be the very per- fection of cunning mystery, to get married so -suddenly or so slyly, that none of their friends would know of the courtship, until they were introduced as Mdrs.

But that is not- the case with us--it is well known that we are affianced-we-make no mystery of our intention to get married-when we get ready-and that is. what I propose now to do; and that will be carrying out the principles of economy that I have learned in this house. It is now the beginning of winter: the year-will end in May, that sweetest of all the months of the year for a bright honey-moon ; and during the winter I will devote my leisure time to looking up, buying, making, and getting' together all the little et ceteras of house-keep- ing; in doing which I shall find the advice of Mrs. Savery and the assistance of Lillie v'y  11  a  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7637-00000127"/> 250    ECONQlr ILLUSTRATED. almost invaluable. In the meantime you shall determine where we are to live, and get our house ready, and next May-day we will move into it in the morning, and at, dinner time you shall have your first meal provided by the hands of your own dear wife. Now, is not that a lesson of economy, worth all the roman- tic marriages of Gretna Green?"- "You are a blessed angel, and you shall be my guide, I hope, through a long life of happiness." "Rather, we will go hand-in-hand, my voice cheering you, and your strength sustaining me. It is-thus a man and wife should live, and then they will be happy." v It was very true, - as Salinda said, that the advice of Mrs. Savery would prove invalua- ble in providing for house-keeping. Her father was willing to purchase almost any amount of costly furniture, but- Salinda stead- ily refused. She wanted first to see where- it was to be put, and then she would determine what she would have.  "That you shall see to-morrow morning," said Charley, It was now winter, but one of   AN OLD HOM B,     251 those clear, mild days that make an American- winter so delightful, when Salinda went to see the spot selected for her future home. She was aware that something had been going on for some time between Mr. Savery and Char- ley, which they were not disposed to let her into the secret of; but whether it was a house or some article of furniture, she was not cer- tain. However, this clear, beautiful morning was to determine the- extent of their secrets. Just on the outskirts of the town lived old Captain Peabody, whose wife kept the cow that eat the grass saved by Frank from the garden borders and grass plot. Salinda had often, admired the place, it was so neat, 'with its large garden and fruit trees, and little white stable, and old well, and green grass, and shady yard; but the old house, like its old occupants, had been, in its prime fifty years ago. Both had seen their day, and the old lady had gone to her last home, leaving her old partner the sole occupant of their late one-noW home no- more; and he had been persuaded to part with it, and go and spend the remainder of his days with a daughter in the country. * It was a sad thing to go and  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7637-00000128"/> 252     ECoNoMY I4BTSKATED. le ave a house where he had lived over fifty years, and all the choice trees jnd shrubs that bore fruit and flowers; but it was a consola- -tion to the old man to know into whose hands all his treasured things were going to fall, and that the place would be occupied by those who would not only permit, but welcome his occasional visits. "If it warm't for the poor old house looking so shabby," said Capt. Peabody to Charley Goodman, "I would offer to sell you my place, because your Salinda, would so-appreciate the garden and fruit, and all the little conve- niences that. make life comfortable; and I would sell it to you cheaper than to any other person I know of, because I know that I should always meet- with such a kind welcome and sweet smile from her, when Il came to look after my pet trees, and, perhaps, use my pru- ning knife here and there- as it was eeded. I really must stipulate for the privilege of trimming the grape vines every season, as I could not bear to see them grow worthless for. want of care\ Ah I it is not many years that I shall care for them at best."

I shall think it- good economy to make such an arrangement, .for the many things that you can teach me, not only in pruning the vines, but, in everything else, by- which you have kept the place in such order that it attracts the attention of all -passing by; and as for Salinda, you know how much she loves a garden and shrubbery." "And shall have it. I don't want the money, but I suppose it is worth a thousand dollars, perhaps it would sell for- more, but no matter; I: want that sum secured to my four grandchildren, when they come of age, and the place is yours; is it a bargain?" "It-,s; I will have the papers prepared to- morrow, and go to work at once, and you shall soon see how quick I can- cure the house of its shabby;"appearance. If you please, do not tell Salinda; I want to give her a pleasant little surprise."        -   &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7637-00000129"/> 254    sCONOMY ipLLUSTRATED. He did so upon the morning mentioned. The place was about a mile from Mr. Savery's, afid the day clear, dry and bracing. He o6ffered- to get a carriage, but she simply said, ^ " would that be good economy?"It would not, because the walk was not only pleasant, but in such air, particularly healthy. It would be- good economy for ladies to take many such walks.  The plan arranged was, that Mrs. Savery and the girls should start whenever they got ready, and Mr. Savery and Charley would meet them at the Capt. Peabody place, where, it was understood, they were, at work fixing up the house for sale, and go from there to the house: he talked of occupying, which was close by, in that pleasant neighborhood. " Dear me, Mrs. Savery," said Salinda, " do look what a pretty cottage they have made ' where the old house used to stand. I declare I wish Charley could have bought that, it would have been perfectly lovely. Who did he say was going to live there? I am afraid that I shall break the tenth commandment." "I hope not; I do not recollect that he ever X ,z   THE OLD HOUSE REBULT.   255 told me who was going to live here, but who- ever it is will have a very pleasant home; the old man has a valuable collection of fruit."

"That is a good sentiment, Salinda; let us / step in and inquire who the new owner is, and whether he will be likely to carry out your wishes." They found,! upon examination, that the old house had :not been taken away entirely; it was only remodeled. The frame was one of the old sort of solid oak, calculated to endure for ever, upon its firmin stone-wall foundation,  that extended to the bottom of a dry cellar, and there rested upon a rock. Up9o such a foundation a more modern form had been wrought out of the old fabric. The large stone chimney had been removed from the center, and two brick tops added to the-roof, which had been changed into a gothic form, and tops are only needed where stoves take the place of hearth-stones. In the place of the chimney was now a stairw-ay to four good :,r  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7637-00000130"/> J     -  "' 256    ECONOMY ILLUSTArED. bed-rooms above, and -to cellar, milk-iroom, and coal-room below.

The articles are made of the wood of the American tulip-tree, and the painter has very appropri- ately chosen the flower and leaf for 'an orna- ment; just as you see in the oak-room, the handles of the bureau are carved acorns, and oak-leaves, and on the walnut and maple, there is the representation of a leaf in gilt.

While Salinda was enjoying her raptures, to see how nice everything looked, and won- dering how all these changes would affect the good old man, to whom they owed so much for the embellishments of the ground, which no amount of industry could have given them in the short time it had taken to metamor- phose the house, she was startled with the feeling of a hand upon her shoulder-some one had approached unseen, and she turned suddenly, and met the smiling face, glowing beneath the snowy locks of the man she was just talking about in words of such heart- feeling. In another moment-it was impulse -without. premeditation-a sort of magnetic attraction-he was pressing her in his arms, while she gave him a child-like, affectionate kiss.  "I will tell you what he thinks--how he feels--thatl in giving up his old home to strangers, he never shall feel like a stranger among them. You will be to me more like a dear child of my own, than a stranger, and 12  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7637-00000135"/> 266    ECONOMY ILLUSTRATED. all this change does not grieve me half as much as it would to come back to the same old house I left, and find an old hat here,-a pillow or old rags there, filling the broken windows, and the whole house occupied with dirt and squalid wretchedness. It is the first time I have seen my old home since I left it- the change is very great, to be sure, but all for the best." : Salinda then took the old man through the house, and skowed him the new arrangements and conveniences, with all of which he ex- pressed as much delight as though he had made them himself for a favorite child.- -At last she opened the door of his old bed-room; and when he saw that amid all the altera- tions, this had been preserved without change, 'his he-tiwas too full for uttelance. He knew the object, and felt the full force of the kind act; and tears trickled down his cheeks, as he stood -offering up a mental prayer for those who showed such feeling for others, that they should never lack ministering angels to their own declining years.      i It is strange how little is required to move   GETTIiNG READY FOR THE W-VI);)ING. 2t 7J the human heart, and since such. trifling acts; of kindly feeling of, one to another piroduce so much happiness to giver as well as receiver, that we are not nmore anxious to be kind to one another.  Time now sped on rapidly with the prepara- tions for housekeeping. Few seem to under- stand the economy, however, of all these preparations before marriage? nstead of after; for- then the time of the young wife is more or less absorbed by calls of friends, many of which must be returned, or friends and ac- quaintances will feel that the laws -hich govern the courtesies of-life have been vio- lated. March, that month, of storm, cold and blus- tering winds, snows and rains, with alternate freezing and thawing, which makes Oi#ne of the most uncomfortable months of all the year, had come and gone almost unnoticed by Salinda and the Saverys, so busy were they in this work of preparation. April, too, -with its sunshine and showers, its summer hot days, and chilling cold, was rapidly going do wnl the smooth ways that launch the gliding "fi--'   &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7637-00000136"/> 68  -  - ECONOMY ILLUSTRATED. months into eternity, deep-fieighted as they are with whatever serves to make up the cargo of joys or sorrows of human life. May-day was now rapidly approaching, and May-day had been set apart by Salinda for that-to- a young woman-most important of all- days of her life-her wedding-day. During the winter there had been one sub- jeet frequently ;hlked over among those who occupied the sitting-roomj and made up that pleasant family circle at the Saverys. That subject was the Doolittle family. The change was indeed a wonderful -one. Triphenia had' kept her promise to her father to the letter; for she had done all a child could do to make his home a pleasant one, and in this she had been ably assisted by Kitty. Mrs. Savery had been out several times to visit and advise with themn, and her instructions were well fol- lowed. Tripllenia said she was determined to win her approbation as a housekeeper, to as great a degree as she had lost her respect, while absorbed in the folly of trying to ape a class that all her antecedents had unfitted her for. - Being naturally of a strong mind, full of   EFFECTS OF REFORM.   .  269 the raw material out of which proper educa- tion imakes a smart, sensible woman, she was quick to -learn, and- six months' practical education had produced almost as great a change in her, as the same period had in Cap- tain Peabody's old house. Salinda and Lillic had often visited the girls in their, humble hlome in the country, and always came away as much- delighted with' their visit, as they had been formerly disgusted. The girls had been persuaded, too, into a new course of reading, and Salinda and Lillie had both undertaken to furnish them books with their own notes and comments, and re- ferences to particular chapters, pages or sen- tences. Charley Goodman, too, had entered into the spirit of the thing, and used to come every spare evening, and while Mrs. S8avery and the girls plied their busy needles, he whiled the time away reading aloud; and Mr.. Savery, whenever the occasion offered, added some comments, and Firank acted as note-taker, which Lillie afterwards wrote out and sent to the Doolittle girls.

It should encourage all of us in the prosecu- tion of a good work, when we read what a beneficial influence was wrought upon those Wayward girli  Triphenia and Kitty, by thesef friendly epistles of good advice and en- couragenent, and the notices of good books, with extracts from their pagesj by whichl a new taste for reading was acquired, and a very vicious habit of Leading none but the most ex- citing novels got rid of, by which both mind and morals were improved. The last day of April at length arrived. The wedding dress was all ready; it was a simple, plain white muslin; no more expensive than would be appropriate for the daughter of a veryliurnmble mechanic. Salinda had steadily rejected all -the offers of her parents to provide costly apparel, or jewelry ornaments. "I already have enough," she said, "and I will not grieve a woman who has devoted so much attention to- teaching, me economy, as Xrs. Savery has, by incurring a useless expendi-         . },   THE BANK CERiTIFICATE.   271 ture." She only asked just enough besides her own simple dress, to apparel her bridesmaid, the dear Lillie, just like herself, and give a new suit to " brother Frank." Mr. Lovewell had made it A a matter of business" to pay Mrs. Savery punctuallyevery month the sum stipulated for Jlinda's " board and-tuition." He was always careful to insert these terms in every receipt -and he was just about as careful to send the money on the last day of the month, as he was to pay his notesd in bank; and it was always sent in gold. In the excitement of this bunsy evening, this wonted punctuality had been forgottenlby the recipients, but not by the payer of the money, and while they were sitting as usual after tea, in their family chit-chat, a ring -was heard upon the door-bell, and while Salinda *as     : wondering if that could be father and mother, the regular monthly messenger was ushered : into the room with his " little matter of busi- n ess."           ,      i "I wish," thought Lillie, " that Mr. Pre- cisionhad for once -forgotten that this is the last day of the month, in the evening, and  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7637-00000138"/> 272    ECONOXzY ILLUSTRATED. that to-morrow we are going to have a wed-  ding here!' for Salinda had stipulated that she might be married in a house that had been to her a home for the happiest year of her life. Mrs. Savery thought as she took the pack- age and signed the receipt, ' I wonder if this puictual man otistn ss:,ferinalIty will let the year pass without ever expressing a single ': word of approbation, excep thhis regular pay- ment for 'board and tuition '  ' there was nothing to indicate that the man felt tjbat he had any other obligation to dis- charge, and MXis. Savery bowhed her head upon. her hand- it must be  d, slightly "sad. She was not a vain woman, but she had that g-ood trait in human nature which prompts many a noble action--a love of ap- probation. She was so absorbed in thought, :1- that she did not notice that the man, before he left the: room, had crossed over and handed a -. .pagkage, to Lillie, who was just then wishing tX nman ha; not come there. He simply said: "This is for you, Miss Lillie Savery," and bowed himself out of the rbom. - I  ,P;                . ^ ,e -   I ILLITR'S SURPRISE.  . 273 '- Lillie sat in a. maze of wonder, eyeing 'the' formidable seal which hadbeen affixea by y -thee old clerk with as much scrupulous exact- ness as though he was going to send it by mail, instead of being his omzn postman.

Tears trickled down the cheeks of Mrs. -Jvei:, as Lillie read the note, which though very short, was very expressive. Her love'of approbation was fully gratified.   t was, perhaps, very well that all minds [were just now diverted from thi ubjct by another.

What could he be waiting for? Wthatwas to be said to the girls? That was soon known, o,?Jr Mr. Savery came back with an unusually serious face, and as he entered, said, "Poor Doolittle!" "Poor Doolittle!" replied Mrs. Saverry;  why, you alarm me; what has happened?" - 'iNothing has happened yet; but he is likely to lose his housekeeper-that is,- his Adest one- 'Triphenia is going to be mar- red, and like Salinda, she has chosen May- day for her wedding day.   :'ANOTHER SURPRI$IS;.
