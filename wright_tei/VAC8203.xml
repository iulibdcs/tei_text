PART I.&#xD;
" YEs, madam," she said, setting&#xD;
down the basket of snow-white linen,&#xD;
which she had poised so skillfully on her&#xD;
head, as she advanced, that she scarcely&#xD;
seemed conscious of its presence. "Yes,&#xD;
madam, I can answer you now, though I&#xD;
could not when you first spoke ; and so&#xD;
you might have thought me uncivil when&#xD;
I was only overcome by my feelings. I&#xD;
do remember the first time I ever saw&#xD;
my mistress, Madame Aglite Maturepas.&#xD;
I was between nine and ten years old,&#xD;
then, very small and delicate for my&#xD;
age, though, and I had been playing&#xD;
near the sugar-mills with the other chil-&#xD;
dren, and had dropped asleep at last,&#xD;
tired out-for I was not strong like the&#xD;
rest-under a great live-oak tree that&#xD;
grew near by, when I felt a few drops&#xD;
of ice-cold water flutter in my face, and,&#xD;
catching my breath, I awoke suddenly."&#xD;
" Lazy little thing, - get up," said a&#xD;
sweet voice above me. " You came&#xD;
very near getting snake-bitten lying here&#xD;
in the grass. See what a big copper-&#xD;
head your Master Richard has killed,&#xD;
just as it was about to strike you. Now&#xD;
you must never lie down out of doors&#xD;
again-never !"---shaking me slightly,&#xD;
for, though I understood every word she&#xD;
said, I was not more than half aroused,&#xD;
being a languid creature, naturally, ex-&#xD;
cept when the fit was on me--I mean&#xD;
the excitement that makes one forget all&#xD;
bodily trouble or ailment.. So, all this&#xD;
I heard in a half-drowsy condition, as if&#xD;
I were dreaming. A quicker repetition&#xD;
of the big drops soon brought me to my&#xD;
feet. I staggered-for a moment rubbed&#xD;
my eyes; then, suddenly bracing myself&#xD;
to stand upright, looked full in the face&#xD;
of my master's wife. I had heard my&#xD;
mother and the other women talking&#xD;
about the new mistress-how pretty she&#xD;
&#xD;
was-how young-what a pity it seem-&#xD;
ecd that she had come to that wretched,&#xD;
unquiet home-with much more that I&#xD;
could not understand or distinctly re-&#xD;
member ; but I had not seen her until&#xD;
now, and I stood dazzled and delighted&#xD;
with'her beauty. Madam, she was the&#xD;
prettiest woman my eyes ever rested on.&#xD;
I thought so then, and I think the same&#xD;
way now.   She was both fair and dark,&#xD;
like most of cur Southern ladies ; but&#xD;
every thing else was her own. With a&#xD;
complexion like cream, black - haired,&#xD;
dark-eyed, straight-featured, she had the&#xD;
sweetest, reddest lips eyes ever rested on,&#xD;
and when she smiled her teeth were&#xD;
like pearls. They had a kind of ltif-&#xD;
look I never saw in any other teeth, and&#xD;
were her greatest beauty, many.,people&#xD;
said.' Besides that, she was 1lim, and&#xD;
tall and graceful, with beautiful feet and&#xD;
hands--the latter like ivory. I noticed&#xD;
these at once, for the drops of water she&#xD;
had been flinging in my face, out of the&#xD;
glass she held, were still dripping from&#xD;
her fingers' tips ; and, as I said before,&#xD;
these drops were icy cold, for she was&#xD;
one of those persons who could neve-&#xD;
touch water, winter or summer, without&#xD;
its being iced: Ice-water was her pas-&#xD;
sion, she used to say, as wine is that of&#xD;
some people.&#xD;
Ah, madam, you see how that North-&#xD;
ern feeling was working in her veins&#xD;
from the very first, and you shall hear&#xD;
how ice and snow, indeed,chilled the very&#xD;
life-blood in her heart before all was over.&#xD;
" Open your eyes, little tipsy one," she&#xD;
said, laughing,; " you reel like a drunken&#xD;
robin.  Have you, too, been pecking&#xD;
china-berries ?" Then, with a sudden&#xD;
change of thought, she cried out, in a&#xD;
voice of agony : " Oh, Richard, what if&#xD;
she is snake-bitten I"&#xD;
The glass fell from her hand and shiv-&#xD;
ered on the ground beside me, and she,&#xD;

THE "ROMANCE OF THE GREEN SEAL."        5&#xD;
&#xD;
had seized me with her trembling hands,&#xD;
and dropped on her knees beside me&#xD;
before I could reassure her.&#xD;
"I anm so glad!" she said, "so re-&#xD;
lieved I"&#xD;
Then she kissed me!&#xD;
Oh ! madam, when the blessed angels&#xD;
take hold of me in heaven, to teach me&#xD;
my new life, I may feel as I did then&#xD;
--never before !  Even yet that kiss&#xD;
seems at times to thrill upon my cheek,&#xD;
like a sign and a covenant of joy; but,&#xD;
at the time, I stood quite still, and she&#xD;
little dreamed what glued me to the spot,&#xD;
while my head grew light with transport.&#xD;
She had risen now, and stood smiling&#xD;
down upon me, though her eyes were full&#xD;
of tears. " The child is a little fool,"&#xD;
she said, drawing me toward her with&#xD;
a playful gesture.  "I believe I have&#xD;
frightened her out of her senses nearly !&#xD;
Yet, look at her, Richard ; what a pretty&#xD;
deer-like creature she is! Tell me your&#xD;
name, little one-try and tell me," and&#xD;
she put back the thick tangled ringlets&#xD;
from my eyes, speaking most encourag-&#xD;
ingly, looking even more so.&#xD;
" Rena I" I said, timidly, almost gasp-&#xD;
ing with emotion, yet looking her full in&#xD;
the eyes.&#xD;
"Rena ?  It is a pretty name," she&#xD;
said, still pondering on my face, " and&#xD;
those are honest eyes" She mused a&#xD;
moment, then turned away, shaking her&#xD;
head. " What a pity she is so :fair,&#xD;
Richard," she said, "so nearly white.&#xD;
I am sorry for the poor-poor little&#xD;
thing !"&#xD;
" Because she is pretty and happens&#xD;
to be fair of face ?" he replied. " Truly,&#xD;
a strange cause of lamentation where&#xD;
a woman is concerned ! None but a&#xD;
woman could think so, I am sure." He&#xD;
spoke playfully.&#xD;
The young gentleman was her cousin,&#xD;
and enough like her to be her own bro-&#xD;
ther.&#xD;
" Oh, not that-not that, for its own&#xD;
sake alone," she said, hastily ; " but I&#xD;
am sure you understand me. Why&#xD;
make me explain ? It is not like you to&#xD;
tease, Richard I',&#xD;
And probably he adic understand her,&#xD;
though I did not until long afterward;&#xD;
&#xD;
and yet I remembered distinctly every&#xD;
uncomprehended word that she spoke to&#xD;
me, then and thereafter.&#xD;
Rena paused thoughtfully.&#xD;
"You express yourself singularly,&#xD;
Rena," I said, "for a woman of your&#xD;
condition. It must have been this habit-&#xD;
ual memory of words that assisted you&#xD;
to such accuracy of language, unusual.&#xD;
with your people."&#xD;
" Ah, madam, you will not be sur-&#xD;
prised at this when I have told you all,&#xD;
and how close I came to her from that&#xD;
hour. Besides, she took pains with me&#xD;
in every way, teaching me secretly what&#xD;
the law forbade her to teach me, and&#xD;
openly whatever was permitted. She&#xD;
was one of those persons that blew&#xD;
sweetness all about them, like a rose or&#xD;
a jessamine flower, and did not keep it&#xD;
shut up like odors in a casket. God&#xD;
made her to perfume His world, I think,&#xD;
like any other blossom; and she felt this,&#xD;
for she made little difference in her con-&#xD;
sideration of high or low. Wherever&#xD;
her sweet smiles and words could give&#xD;
comfort, they were given, and it is a&#xD;
great mistake to think that a poor slave&#xD;
does not feel courtesy and beautiful&#xD;
ways as much as a great lady or gen-&#xD;
tleman. When master objected to her&#xD;
open, happy manners, and said she had&#xD;
som e strangeness in her that he could&#xD;
not understand, I heard Master Richard&#xD;
telling him that God had made her dif-&#xD;
ferent from most of His creatures-that&#xD;
she was one of his' elect,' a born poet--&#xD;
that was what he called her, 'and such&#xD;
beings, Monsieur Maurepas', I heard him&#xD;
say, 'have their own ways of seeing and&#xD;
thinking and doing, that can never be&#xD;
corrected. One of these is to love&#xD;
every thing pretty much alike in this&#xD;
outward world of ours, for the sake of&#xD;
its Maker, and hold only a few things&#xD;
close and dear for their own sake; an.&#xD;
other is the stripping away of all dis-&#xD;
guises.'"&#xD;
"Disguises ? Who talks of disguises ?"&#xD;
my master interrupted, while his face&#xD;
grew black and stormy. "Distinction is&#xD;
the word you aim at, perhaps, Richard&#xD;
Zavier !" and h~e brought his hand down&#xD;
hard upon the table. "By heaven, when&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
I'     '&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
I see a woman treat her negroes with&#xD;
more civility than some of her husband's&#xD;
chosen associates, I think she wants&#xD;
sense and discrimination, sir I"&#xD;
Master Richard was silent, for he&#xD;
knew what my master alluded to. It&#xD;
was my mistress' dread of those gam-&#xD;
blers he kept so constantly,about him--&#xD;
1. Le Maitre, in particular, for reasons of&#xD;
her cwn, that she never, told any one,&#xD;
but that I suspected as I grew older.&#xD;
And true enough it was that she was&#xD;
kind, and polite, and feeling to her slaves,&#xD;
and they adored her for it; so that when&#xD;
she went into their quarters to see the&#xD;
sick, or to carry little presents to the&#xD;
women, those who touched her hand, or&#xD;
the hem of her dress even, were made&#xD;
happy. And they loved me the better&#xD;
because she set me above them all. That&#xD;
was a proof, I think, madam, of their&#xD;
devotion to her, and of the way she had&#xD;
of disarming envy and jealousy---things&#xD;
that make people so hard to each other,&#xD;
as a general rule.&#xD;
" I hope it is not the 'poets borm' who&#xD;
alone are gifted in this way, my good&#xD;
Rena," I said, being myself a prosaic&#xD;
person, and a little nettled for my class;&#xD;
" but that all good Christians love God&#xD;
and His works, and dissuade their breth-&#xD;
ren from evil."&#xD;
"Alh, there is the difference, madam,&#xD;
after all! You have shown it to me,&#xD;
in a few words," said the quadroon,&#xD;
thoughtfully.  " Christians do what is&#xD;
right from the letter of their teachings,&#xD;
and their love of duty ; but she needed&#xD;
no such lesson, and heeded no such law..&#xD;
I am sorry to tell you this, madam; but&#xD;
I have put my hand to the plow-handle,&#xD;
as the preachers say, and I will not look&#xD;
back. You shall hear this story, as you&#xD;
desire to do, in all its naked truth.&#xD;
"Beyond a certain point, duty was no&#xD;
law to her.  She could not understand&#xD;
it as pleasant or beautiful, apart from&#xD;
inclination. It chafed her, and she&#xD;
strained and fretted against her chain&#xD;
until it snapped. Then she felt free !&#xD;
For the rest, she was born pitying and&#xD;
true, and those that made her otherwise&#xD;
should bear the blame. .&#xD;
"People have a right to be happy if&#xD;
&#xD;
[ !i&#xD;
&#xD;
they can. I remember a copy she set&#xD;
me once, madam.    She called it her&#xD;
"golden rule"&#xD;
" Give love n limits; hate no holiday."&#xD;
"What an extreme sentiment, Rena.&#xD;
I fear your sweet mistress was a little&#xD;
implacable after all-revengeful even."&#xD;
"Yes, madam, she was; but it was&#xD;
long before she came to that condition&#xD;
of mind. She bore so much first, she&#xD;
forgave so often and so freely, that any&#xD;
one not wholly blind and reckless could&#xD;
have prevented it and made her happy.&#xD;
For she was kind, pitying, tender to the&#xD;
last degree; then, all at once, stone.&#xD;
could not be harder or more insensible.&#xD;
That was her nature, madam; God made&#xD;
her so when He poured Spanish blood&#xD;
into her veins. You see, very few knew&#xD;
her as I did, whose youth was spent in&#xD;
her service-hers! now a blessed angel, I&#xD;
must believe, in glory with her Savior."&#xD;
The woman wiped her still brilliant&#xD;
eyes, and turned away.&#xD;
After a pause I spoke:&#xD;
"You loved her very fondly, it seems,&#xD;
Rena ?"&#xD;
" Yes, madam, more than I have done&#xD;
my nearest of kin."&#xD;
"Strange-strange ! Yet, you were&#xD;
her slave I Iow can this be accounted&#xD;
for? You are now a free woman, and&#xD;
know the vast difference of situations.&#xD;
What made the hand so dear to you that&#xD;
held you in bondage ?"&#xD;
I spoke warmbly-indignantly almost,&#xD;
for I resented as an injury to human-na-&#xD;
ture this spaniel-like affection in one of&#xD;
my kind ; but I forgot at the time, or did&#xD;
not fairly recognize, as I since'..have&#xD;
done, the difference of race.&#xD;
" You Northern ladies can never&#xD;
know," said Rena, solemnly, " the strong&#xD;
bond of affection that draws. together&#xD;
good slave, good master. The evil of&#xD;
both classes hate each other, as do- all&#xD;
evil persons, wherever found ; but this&#xD;
tie, that can not be broken in most cases&#xD;
except by death, is like marriage-some-&#xD;
times most dear, at others hard to bear."&#xD;
I did not recognize the force of the&#xD;
comparison, yet suffered it to pass un-&#xD;
challenged, hoping that she might there-&#xD;
after proceed with less digression. I&#xD;
&#xD;

THE "RO1JANCE OF THE GREEN SEAL."         7'&#xD;
&#xD;
6           THE1 )     CE.- OF THE GREEN SEAL." .&#xD;
&#xD;
was disappointed. It was now her&#xD;
turn to interrogate.&#xD;
"And now, let me ask- you, madam,&#xD;
before I go farther in this story-which&#xD;
I have never before told except in&#xD;
broken snatches-why it is you show so&#xD;
deep an interest in the fate of my poor&#xD;
mistress, and whether it was to hear of&#xD;
her that you sought me out, through thin&#xD;
wide city, to be your laundress, when&#xD;
you could have procured others, near at&#xD;
home, quite as skillful ?"&#xD;
" Your first question I will answer,&#xD;
Rena, before we part ; your second at&#xD;
once. It was for this I sought you;&#xD;
and now that I have obtained the pro-&#xD;
mise of this history, let me question you&#xD;
in turn: Why is it that you-a woman&#xD;
so superior to your class in attainments&#xD;
-still follow one of their humblest oc-&#xD;
cupations?  You who might obtain con-&#xD;
fidential employment, or instruct others&#xD;
of your blood, for a livelihood ?"&#xD;
" There are laws and limits, lady, in&#xD;
the South for all people of color," she&#xD;
said, timidly. "I should not dare to&#xD;
teach; but I have a pleasant house,&#xD;
and young clerks for boarders who pay&#xD;
well, and women to help me about my&#xD;
cookery and laundry work-the work&#xD;
I love the best, because I was taught&#xD;
early by my mother to wash fine linen,&#xD;
and my mistress would wear no gar-,&#xD;
ment touched by any other hands than&#xD;
hers or mine. Fine spider-web linen&#xD;
she wore, to be sure, with not half' the&#xD;
weight in it of yours and others I have&#xD;
washed for-linen-cambric tunics -and&#xD;
such like."&#xD;
I smiled at the curious word so deli-&#xD;
cately applied : "Your mistress was a&#xD;
Sybarite," I said, smiling.&#xD;
" Yes, I heard Master Richard call&#xD;
her so. No ! it was a Sibyl he called&#xD;
her ! What is a Sybarite, madam ?" she&#xD;
asked, with a sudden shadow of suspi-&#xD;
cion stealing over her fine countenance.&#xD;
" Only a person, Rena, who wants&#xD;
every thing about him or her perfectly&#xD;
luxuriant. There was one of old times&#xD;
who could not sleep on a bed of roses&#xD;
because one leaf was crumpled. Your&#xD;
mistress was particular in the extreme&#xD;
it seems." -&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, in some matters-not' in. all&#xD;
She always slept hard, madam; ate&#xD;
simply, touched no wines, cared little&#xD;
for jewels; her bath,- her flowers, her&#xD;
fine fragrant linen, her books, her time,&#xD;
were what she wanted and would have.&#xD;
Then she burned a great many wax&#xD;
candles, it is true-yes, she was wasteful&#xD;
in this respect-this only," and she&#xD;
shook her head in a deprecating way.&#xD;
"I heard Master Richard tell her she&#xD;
reminded him of the cobbler of Brusa,&#xD;
when he saw her with so many lights&#xD;
in' her chamber. Did you ever hear of&#xD;
him, madam?   The cobbler of Brusa, I&#xD;
mean."&#xD;
Remembering the odd tale of Eastern&#xD;
origin, I laughed- and nodded. " When&#xD;
will she get into the heart of the mys-&#xD;
tery ?" I thought.&#xD;
" A strange spiritual creature, was this&#xD;
same fair mistress of yours, Rena," I&#xD;
suggested. "Go on. All that you tell&#xD;
me of her interests me more and more.&#xD;
What was her story, Rena ?"&#xD;
SAi, madam, you will have to let&#xD;
me tell it in my own way, if you care to,&#xD;
hear it to the end. I see that you are&#xD;
impatient, but I can not help that. Jus-&#xD;
tice must be done to all, and before you&#xD;
know what my mistress did and how she&#xD;
suffered, you must know what she was,&#xD;
and what others around her were -&#xD;
then you will be prepared to judge cor-&#xD;
rectly."&#xD;
" This is what painters call putting in&#xD;
a background, Rena, to relieve the&#xD;
figures against. You are right; spare&#xD;
no details. I would know every thing.&#xD;
Take your own time, too," and I leaned&#xD;
back, expectantly, in my chair, resting&#xD;
my cheek on my hand, and fixing my&#xD;
eyes earnestly on the quadroon, who&#xD;
calmly proceeded :&#xD;
I have told you that Master Rich-&#xD;
ard, said she was a " born poet," and&#xD;
not responsible, like other people. This&#xD;
made-her, very independent, I suppose;&#xD;
for, in spite of continual unkindness on&#xD;
my master's part, and the many crosses&#xD;
he threw in her path, she had her oivan.&#xD;
way of being happy and making others&#xD;
so. She used to tell me that she had&#xD;
an outward world, and an inward&#xD;
&#xD;
 '&#xD;
&#xD;
world, apart from the rest. Not even&#xD;
Master Richard could enter these. She&#xD;
sa# only one ever crossed its boundar-&#xD;
ie she told me afterwards, and he came&#xD;
to destroy and to desolate. She called&#xD;
it the " world of fancy !"&#xD;
The woman gazed at me so seriously&#xD;
that I felt she had lent a material mean-&#xD;
ing to the metaphor, or, at least, a re-&#xD;
spect bordering on fanaticism. I was&#xD;
touched by the simplicity of her faith&#xD;
and her wrapt fidelity.&#xD;
" A beautiful, but dangerous king-&#xD;
dom," I was tempted to reply.&#xD;
" And there she was a crowned&#xD;
queen, madam ! I have heard her say&#xD;
so to Master Richard ; but that was only&#xD;
her pretty way of talking, I know, for&#xD;
I never saw her wear any thing of the&#xD;
kind on her head, nor any scepter either,&#xD;
in her hand-a scepter which she pro-&#xD;
mised him to put forth some clay, and&#xD;
so touch men's hearts to do deeds of&#xD;
good and glory. But she never did,"&#xD;
shaking her head sadly.&#xD;
"Did she write, Rena--I mean com:&#xD;
pose poems, or stories, or publish them ?&#xD;
I think I have heard so."&#xD;
"Oh'! yes, madam; she wrote a great&#xD;
deal, and took great comfort in her pen.&#xD;
These writings she published in different&#xD;
papers, with Master Richard's assist-&#xD;
ance, and signed her name 'Valence' to&#xD;
all of them. This was her middle name,&#xD;
and everybody in 'Belle-Garde' parish&#xD;
took pride in these beautiful pieces,&#xD;
which were praised far and near. For&#xD;
all that, her real name, as the writer,&#xD;
never got out to the world, nor beyond&#xD;
the immediate neighbors.   She .was&#xD;
called Aglac by her family and friends,&#xD;
and by strangers, of course, Madame&#xD;
Aglde Maur pas."&#xD;
I saw at once what scepter she had1&#xD;
alluded to in her girlish gayety of vani-&#xD;
ty, but thought it useless to enlighten&#xD;
Rena; so I only replied, amused by her&#xD;
little pomposity.&#xD;
" Quite a grand name, Rena !"&#xD;
"Ah ! madam? I never thought so,"&#xD;
she rejomned ; " that .3arpas had&#xD;
always an evil sound to me. Mas-&#xD;
ter Richard said it meant a 'cruel&#xD;
feast,' in the beginning; but. perhaps he&#xD;
&#xD;
was jesting. Still, it sounded ill to me.&#xD;
And cruel feasting enough there was,&#xD;
indeed, in that house of Maurepas ! One&#xD;
would have thought Satan and all his&#xD;
imps had been let loose in that great&#xD;
basement - hall - when Monsieur Le&#xD;
Maitre and his cronies came up to do a&#xD;
night's gambling with my master."&#xD;
" And it was from wretches like these,&#xD;
your mistress- shrunk ! No wonder,&#xD;
poor child," I said, musingly ; " but, tell&#xD;
me, Rena, had your profligate master no&#xD;
love for his young and tender wife?"&#xD;
" More than she ever knew, madam;&#xD;
more than he knew himself, for people&#xD;
don't always understand rightly, it seems&#xD;
to me, what is in their own hearts. She&#xD;
was his pride; yet there never passed a&#xD;
day when he was at home that he did&#xD;
not try to cross or sting her, in some&#xD;
way, or throw her off her guard so as&#xD;
to gain a mean advantage over her ;&#xD;
and when he was gone, he set his spies&#xD;
to watch every motion.  But this she&#xD;
never knew; and it is something to say,&#xD;
that even they could find nothing against&#xD;
her, watch as they might. Old Pierre,&#xD;
the gardener, and his wife and daughters,&#xD;
were the only people on the plantation&#xD;
base enough for this office, and they had&#xD;
Indian blood in them, we all knew."&#xD;
'What made you fancy that your&#xD;
master had any affection for one he&#xD;
mistreated so, Rena? What were the&#xD;
signs and tokens ?"&#xD;
"His eyes followed her, madam,&#xD;
wherever she moved. He would lie&#xD;
snioking on the portico, and watch her&#xD;
with a more softened look on his face&#xD;
than I-ever saw come to it at any other&#xD;
time, as she trained the vines on the&#xD;
lattice work, or chirped to her caged&#xD;
birds, or played with her fawn, over the&#xD;
balustrades, holding cake and bread so&#xD;
as to make it rear up and eat from her&#xD;
hand ; then laughing as merrily as a&#xD;
child. You see it was in her to enjoy&#xD;
every thing. It is not many persons&#xD;
that little things please so greatly, as&#xD;
they did her. -Besides, she was always&#xD;
well-and scarcely knew what pain&#xD;
was. Master Richard said she put him&#xD;
in mind of a cup running over with&#xD;
sparkling wine, there was so much life&#xD;

in her. And my master admired all&#xD;
this, though he never said so. She was&#xD;
called, too, the prettiest woman in. the&#xD;
parish, and he was proud of her sitting&#xD;
at the head of his table when his diners&#xD;
came, so gay, so gracious, yet so care-&#xD;
less of every one, for there was not a&#xD;
man among them that could ever touch&#xD;
her fancy, try as they might ; and she&#xD;
loved to get away from them into the&#xD;
quiet of her own chamber, just as soon as&#xD;
possible after the stately meal was over."&#xD;
" Rena," she said to me, one night (I&#xD;
remember it well-it was after a grand&#xD;
dinner party, and the noise of the&#xD;
gentlemen came now and then in bursts&#xD;
through the open window), " Rena, draw&#xD;
down the blinds, close the curtains,&#xD;
light the bougies-that was what she&#xD;
called her wax candles-take away all&#xD;
tis-her fine clothes, she meant-and&#xD;
bring' mei a linen wrapper.  There,&#xD;
little one, sit at my feet, and pass&#xD;
your soft hands across them; they are&#xD;
weary I Now for Hyperion I" and she&#xD;
took up the book she had left, half read,&#xD;
on her table, and pored over it silently&#xD;
for some time. Then she laid it quietly&#xD;
down again, and folded her hands, with&#xD;
a soft,pleased expression.&#xD;
" I am so happy to-night, Rena-so&#xD;
blessed !  Do you know, I care for&#xD;
nothing earthly -outside of this room?&#xD;
Is not this selfish?  And yet, there is&#xD;
enough here to fill my soul with joy and&#xD;
thankfulness to God."&#xD;
"Nothing besides ?" I thought pro-&#xD;
per to say. " Oh, mistress, think of&#xD;
your own dear mother !"&#xD;
Her head drooped a little, and she&#xD;
mum inured: " She is well off with her&#xD;
s n and her good daughter-in-law, and&#xD;
in her comfortable home-for which she&#xD;
bartered me. Was not J    ph happy&#xD;
in Egypt without his brethren, Rena-&#xD;
his brethren, who sold him ? Yet, he&#xD;
never ceased to regard them kindly.&#xD;
I feel like Joseph-alone !"&#xD;
" And Master Richard," I whispered,&#xD;
" dear mistress ? Don't you love master&#xD;
Richard ?"&#xD;
" Oh, certainly, Rena. Why, what&#xD;
possesses you to ask such questions ? Of&#xD;
course I love Richard ; but I am very&#xD;
&#xD;
well without him. I have these spells&#xD;
of unutterable blessedness. I can't help&#xD;
it ! I hope it is not wrong. It is con-&#xD;
stitutional, I suppose, with ne, and I&#xD;
believe I could be contented on a desert&#xD;
island, if .I were suffered to be free and&#xD;
at peace."&#xD;
" Without me, mistress ?" I asked,&#xD;
while tears of vexation stood in my&#xD;
childish eyes, and I clasped her feet&#xD;
spasmodically.'&#xD;
" Little goose, what jealous affection&#xD;
you manifest i What a passionate nature&#xD;
it is," she went on to say, as she heard&#xD;
me sobbing, and felt me clinging closely&#xD;
to her knees, while she patted my head&#xD;
tenderly ; then, in a changed voice, she&#xD;
added: "But, I do love you, Rena, better&#xD;
than aught else in the world, I am afraid&#xD;
-quite well enough for my happiness&#xD;
and yours. It is very dreadful to love&#xD;
any frail, perishable creature as you&#xD;
love me.   Don't indulge such fond-&#xD;
ness, child-don't, if you hope for peace."&#xD;
Than she murmured: "I thank thee,&#xD;
oh, God ! that my heart is suffered to&#xD;
be at rest-if, indeed, I possess one at&#xD;
all.  Of this I doubt sometimes."&#xD;
Just then we heard a tap at the door,&#xD;
and Master Richard came in, glad to&#xD;
escape from the " orgies" below, as lie&#xD;
called them ; and they were soon deep&#xD;
in " Hyperion," and in Tennyson-" a&#xD;
great English poet," they called him.&#xD;
"Locksley Hall," was the poem he&#xD;
read that night, I remember, and it kept&#xD;
ringing in my ears, like a grand organ I&#xD;
once heard in New Orleans, for days&#xD;
and nights afterward.&#xD;
Let me tell you here, madam, that&#xD;
I slept in a little bed in my mistress'&#xD;
dressing-room, that she heard my prayers&#xD;
night and morning, and some lessons&#xD;
through the day; taught me to sew, to&#xD;
embroider, exacted from me implicit&#xD;
obedience, yet never struck me nor&#xD;
scolded me in her life. Yet I feared&#xD;
her. I feared something that was in her,&#xD;
stronger than the power to whip and&#xD;
scold-a spirit that looked out, some-&#xD;
times, from her great .growing eyes,&#xD;
terrible, incomprehensible to me - a&#xD;
silent fiery soul, it seemed, striving to&#xD;
p)ut aside its bonds of flesh-just about to&#xD;

healthy. Besides, this teaches me how&#xD;
to feel for others and to suffer with them.&#xD;
It is good for me, and our Savior him-&#xD;
self was scourged."&#xD;
She said this, I knew, to strengthen&#xD;
herself to bear the pain ; but I could only&#xD;
reply with sobs and tears, while she&#xD;
shivered with agony.&#xD;
" Hush, hush, unreasonable child," she&#xD;
said ; "you have not a particle of courage,&#xD;
I fear, and you quite unnerve me by&#xD;
your conduct. Be still, Rena, and never&#xD;
allude to what you see to-day, nor to the&#xD;
wound-that is, if you love your mis-&#xD;
tress."&#xD;
The injunction was obeyed ; I stifled&#xD;
my 4s, and never before breathed a&#xD;
word of this dreadful stripe to human&#xD;
ears; yet, when my hands straightened&#xD;
her for the coffin, it was still there, pur-&#xD;
ple, and sore, perhaps, through all her&#xD;
life - at least I often suspected this,&#xD;
when I felt her wince from my fingers&#xD;
as I fastened her dresses and stays. But,&#xD;
she never complained, and I knew her&#xD;
too well to ask her any questions about&#xD;
it. She was one of those persons who&#xD;
put aside a wrong once and forever&#xD;
when she forgave it. There were slighter&#xD;
blows than this that she resented more.&#xD;
But, you shall hear.&#xD;
" Was your master really improved&#xD;
by this beautiful forbearance on her-&#xD;
part ?" I asked. "I trust he was, for the&#xD;
honor of human nature. Was he more&#xD;
kind to her thereafter ?"&#xD;
" No, madam, I can not say he was.&#xD;
He was one of those people that needed&#xD;
a victim and enjoyed one, as a cat does&#xD;
torturing a mouse. It was his nature-&#xD;
a fierce appetite. He could not help it,&#xD;
I suppose. Yet, in the bottom of his&#xD;
heart he loved her-if such a feeling&#xD;
came between them at all, a thousand&#xD;
times better than she loved him."&#xD;
"Ay, that was the worst part of the&#xD;
story, Rena. Had she but loved him,&#xD;
all might have been well," I exclaimed,&#xD;
with an irrepressible groan. She started&#xD;
as she saw me leaning back in my chair,&#xD;
quite faint and pale. '&#xD;
" You have some great interest in this&#xD;
tale, lady," she said. " You can not con-&#xD;
ceal it. What can you know of that&#xD;
&#xD;
part of the story, which I have not told&#xD;
you yet ?"&#xD;
"I know nothing perfectly, and that&#xD;
is the reason I seek to know the whole.&#xD;
My reasons you shall have hereafter.&#xD;
My happiness, perhaps, or that of others&#xD;
near to me is staked on the truth of your&#xD;
narration. Tell me nothing else, as you&#xD;
hope for life in heaven."&#xD;
She raised her hand with great sol-&#xD;
emnity. " I swear to tell you the truth,&#xD;
if I tell you any thing," she said, " but&#xD;
this rests with you alone. Would it not&#xD;
be better, for your peace of mind, to&#xD;
hear no .more ? Consider, lady, before&#xD;
you lift the vail: you may find a corpse&#xD;
beneath it, where you hope for life."&#xD;
I saw what she suspected, from my&#xD;
momentary vehemence, and I resolved&#xD;
to disarm her, if possible, by my man-&#xD;
ner thenceforth, of suspicions that might&#xD;
only frustrate my earnest desire to hear the&#xD;
story she alone could give me faithfully,&#xD;
in all its delicate and mysterious details.&#xD;
" I will hear it," I said, calmly. " As&#xD;
a connection by marriage with one of&#xD;
the parties interested, I naturally feel a&#xD;
desire to know the truth- with regard to&#xD;
his complicity in the affair.&#xD;
" Are you sure no blood of yours&#xD;
flowed in his veins, lady ?"&#xD;
"Not a drop, I assure you, Rena."&#xD;
My careless manner and the openness&#xD;
of my gate partly reassured her.&#xD;
" Is that your husband's picture ?" she&#xD;
asked, abruptly, pointing to the cabinet-&#xD;
sizesl portrait 6f a dark, handsome man&#xD;
upon the wall. " As often as I have&#xD;
been here I have never seen him."&#xD;
. " Yes, that is his picture, Rena. My&#xD;
husband is absent just now, in Cuba.&#xD;
When he comes again you shall judge&#xD;
for yourself if this likeness be correct."&#xD;
She mused awhile, looked at me ear-&#xD;
nestly from time to time, finally seemed&#xD;
quite satisfied that she had been mistaken&#xD;
in her first-conjecture, then resumed the&#xD;
thread of her desultory narrative--it might&#xD;
be called - her very strange, analytic,&#xD;
and didactic discourse, which, so far,&#xD;
revealed nothing of all I most desired to&#xD;
know, yet which deeply interested me&#xD;
from its earnestness.&#xD;
"We were speaking of my master,"&#xD;
&#xD;
she said. " He was a French creole,&#xD;
madam, as you might know    from his&#xD;
narie, and there is a great deal of the&#xD;
tiger in 'that llood, at the best, they say;&#xD;
but his, I have heard tell, was a straight&#xD;
stream from the veins of the Frehch&#xD;
revolutionists. He had a long light lock&#xD;
of hair, of a kind of faded gold-color,&#xD;
that he used to bring out sometimes, and&#xD;
that he said his father had torn from the&#xD;
head of the Princess Lamballe, and left&#xD;
to him as a priceless treasure ! Did you&#xD;
-         ever hear of her, madam, or was there,&#xD;
truly, such a person ?"&#xD;
I shuddered as I recalled the frightful&#xD;
incident of her death at the hands of an&#xD;
infuriated mob, and confirmed her ex-&#xD;
istence by a few faltering words, then&#xD;
asked&#xD;
" How did your mistress bear the ex-&#xD;
hibition of this trophy ?"  From trifles&#xD;
like these I thought to derive gradually&#xD;
a true knowledge of her character, apart&#xD;
from prejudice.&#xD;
" Bear it ? She would hide her face&#xD;
and shriek and quiver with agony, as&#xD;
though a poisonous.snake had been in&#xD;
the room. He never did any thing to&#xD;
her at first that affected her more deeply&#xD;
than this, and he took care not to-repeat&#xD;
this torture too often, for fear of losing&#xD;
its effect, I suppose," she said, bitterly.&#xD;
"I could give him credit for no nobler&#xD;
motive."&#xD;
"He was a bad man, Rena, a very&#xD;
fiend. Was it the habit of your mis-&#xD;
tress to retaliate on him, with words, or&#xD;
how did she defend herself from his ill&#xD;
usage ?&#xD;
" With looks, chiefly."&#xD;
"Looks, Rena ?  I did not think any&#xD;
woman's eyes could cope with such a&#xD;
monster."&#xD;
"She had such strange light-in hers-&#xD;
like sheet-lightning in a thunder-cloud.&#xD;
Madam, if you had ever met a panther-&#xD;
cat at twilight, with its great glowing,&#xD;
steady, dilating eyes, shining like balls&#xD;
of fire, you might know how hers looked,&#xD;
sometimes, when my master would tread&#xD;
too sorely on her feelings.  And he&#xD;
shrunic from those looks - he quailed&#xD;
under them, as almost any man would&#xD;
have done. There was great power in&#xD;
&#xD;
her, somehow-gay and delicate, and&#xD;
careless as she seemed to be-Master&#xD;
Richard called it 'magnetic power.' I&#xD;
never understood him exactly."&#xD;
"Did she ever give di one of her&#xD;
terrible looks ?" I asked.&#xD;
" Not more than once or twice in her&#xD;
life, that I know of, and they well-nigh&#xD;
killed him.&#xD;
"Thereseems to have been a strong&#xD;
attachment between these two young&#xD;
people, Rena. Was your master never&#xD;
jealous of Dichard Zavier ?"&#xD;
" Jealousy oh no, madam, not in the&#xD;
true sense of the word... His jealousy&#xD;
of Master Richard was only to vent his&#xD;
rage . They had been bred up like&#xD;
brother and sister, and were own cousins,&#xD;
and, outside of her chamber, Master&#xD;
Richard was the only true comfort my&#xD;
mistress ever had. My master had great&#xD;
respect for him at the bottom of his&#xD;
heart-for his character, so spotless and&#xD;
Christian-like was it; and for his fine in-&#xD;
telligence and manners, and for his&#xD;
blood, which lie well knew was better&#xD;
than his own, though Master Richard-&#xD;
was then, as far as people knew, a poor&#xD;
struggling physician, living in the little&#xD;
town of Claireforte, near by, and just&#xD;
managing to make both ends meet, by&#xD;
editing a small newspaper, and~ keeping&#xD;
the post-office, and selling drugs, as well&#xD;
as practising his profession. Any thing&#xD;
for a decent livelihood, he would say.&#xD;
But he always kept up appearances, as a&#xD;
true gentlemen will ever. strive to do.&#xD;
He had his horse, and his own servant&#xD;
(my husband afterward, madam, an ex-&#xD;
cellent Christian- colored man, like, and&#xD;
yet now unlike, his master), and Master&#xD;
Richard was always well dressed-care-&#xD;
fully so when lie came to Maurepas,&#xD;
which was regularly once a week, {for a&#xD;
night and day, and this was the happiest&#xD;
time of her life to my poor mistress."&#xD;
You should have seen them, madam,&#xD;
sketching and writing and strolling to-&#xD;
gether ; you should have heard his sweet&#xD;
voice i'eading the Scriptures to the slaves&#xD;
on Sunday, and explaining it as he went.&#xD;
Even my master could see no harm in&#xD;
such an intercourse.&#xD;
Yet he often treated Master Richard&#xD;

very coldly, as, indeed, he did all visitors,&#xD;
except those who came to carouse with&#xD;
him, or those who, like himself, had&#xD;
lands, gold, and negroes to boast about ;&#xD;
and, I think, if he had dared to do it, he&#xD;
would have cut his wife off even from&#xD;
this pure and sweet society, as he had&#xD;
done from all others. . For, madam, my&#xD;
mistress was a prisoner on her own plan-&#xD;
tation, never allowed to visit anywhere;&#xD;
and this was whispered around, and in&#xD;
spite of her wealth and beauty, people&#xD;
pitied her as much as they disliked&#xD;
Maurepas.&#xD;
Yet, I mu telling you about the&#xD;
happy time of her life, just now-happy,&#xD;
in spite of her mean, tantalizing husband,&#xD;
her solitude -greater even in cities&#xD;
than elsewhere, when he took her to&#xD;
New Orleans or Mobile, and guarded her&#xD;
all the time, scarcely leaving her alone,&#xD;
even with me, for more than a few&#xD;
moments each day; happy, in spite of&#xD;
my master's quarrels with her mother,&#xD;
which banished Madame Zavier from his&#xD;
house. forever; in spite of the absence&#xD;
9f all religion, except what she built up&#xD;
for herself, on the foundation of Master&#xD;
Richard's teaching, for no expounder of&#xD;
God's word was ever permitted to set&#xD;
foot at Maurepas.&#xD;
In spite of all these drawbacks, she&#xD;
was happy, madam, at the time of which&#xD;
I am telling you ; happy in herself;&#xD;
happy, it seemed to me, like a bee or a&#xD;
butterflyI&#xD;
" A selfish sort of happiness, at best,&#xD;
Rena."&#xD;
" God might have thought so, madam,&#xD;
and so given her the trials I have yet to&#xD;
tell. But, her wrestle in the tent ended&#xD;
not at dawn. Well, it is all over now ;&#xD;
but I can not blame her, study as I&#xD;
may I I am one of those who believe&#xD;
that people have a right to try to be&#xD;
happy in their own way, so that they&#xD;
hurt no one but themselves in the&#xD;
failure."&#xD;
She spoke almost defiantly.&#xD;
Rena," I replied, " duty and princi-&#xD;
pe are above all else, and it is not pos-&#xD;
sible for harm to stop with one alone,&#xD;
any more than for a ripple made by the&#xD;
smallest pebble to cease before it reaches&#xD;
&#xD;
the shore. Such is the philosophy of&#xD;
life-such its stern reality."&#xD;
Rena made no reply, but stooped&#xD;
gloomily to take up the basket she had&#xD;
emptied, and placing - and poising it&#xD;
again on her head, moved toward the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
"You are going Rena ?"&#xD;
"Yes, madam ; but I will return. I&#xD;
have no heart to tell you the story of the&#xD;
'Green Seal' to-day. But, before you&#xD;
go to your own North country again,&#xD;
you shall hear all, if you have a mind to&#xD;
listen patiently, for I have but a slow&#xD;
way of getting along when I talk of&#xD;
her-of my mistress, I mean."&#xD;
Stay, Rena I I have a proposition&#xD;
to make you. Why will you not go&#xD;
North with us, where this stigma of&#xD;
color exists not--where you would be&#xD;
estimated as you deserve to be=-where&#xD;
you could shake off, forever, the old&#xD;
brand of slavery, and live a truer life&#xD;
than you can ever do here ?"&#xD;
She smiled half disdainfully, hesita-&#xD;
ted, colored, but her natural courtesy&#xD;
held in check, I think, the reply she was&#xD;
about to make. Then she said, in soft&#xD;
accents:&#xD;
" Lady, you mean well, I know; but&#xD;
I should die in one year in your coun-&#xD;
try. What would I be away from sun-&#xD;
shine and flowers, and my own fruits,&#xD;
and my own people?   The snow, and&#xD;
the cold, quiet' ways folks have there,&#xD;
would never suit me; nor the food they&#xD;
eat, nor the manner of their living.&#xD;
Then, to have to be thrown with low&#xD;
Dutch and Irish, and such white trash,&#xD;
would be dreadful to me, dear lady.&#xD;
Here, the planters protect us from being&#xD;
troubled by such rabble, and the. free&#xD;
quadroons are very happy together-&#xD;
a race apart. No, I must live and die in&#xD;
the South ; it is my country, and Loui-&#xD;
siana is the garden-spot of the world I"&#xD;
She had said much of this as she&#xD;
walked slowly away from  me. Now&#xD;
turning at the door, she made me a low&#xD;
salaam, ave me a pleasant smile, and&#xD;
vanished into the corridor. A few&#xD;
moments later 1 sawv her stately form&#xD;
passing in the street below my win-&#xD;
dow, erect, graceful, self-poised, with&#xD;
&#xD;
her basket on her head, as an empre&#xD;
crowned I&#xD;
But I knew she would return.&#xD;
was with her now a necessity to te&#xD;
that tale, as great as the "Aiiciei&#xD;
Mariner's "-a necessity even greate&#xD;
perhaps, than was mine to hear it.&#xD;
PART II-&#xD;
AGAmI Rena caine. It was a mornin&#xD;
in June, redolent with balm and fro&#xD;
grance, such a day as we feel nowhere&#xD;
I believe, beyond the northern limits o&#xD;
Louisiana. But, the time had cone fo&#xD;
me to leave behind me that delicious&#xD;
yet dangerous clime, and the last washing&#xD;
of snowy linen had been brought hom&#xD;
preparatory to my departure. Tht&#xD;
quadroon had volunteered to assist mi&#xD;
to pack my trunks, and I had obtained&#xD;
the promise of her long-delayed story&#xD;
before we should commence the busi&#xD;
 ness of the day, or days, as it might be&#xD;
" Sit down, Rena, in that low chair,"&#xD;
I said. " Rest, for you seem weary,&#xD;
Take this for refreshment," and I poured&#xD;
her a glass of iced lemonade from the&#xD;
crystal pitcher on the slab. "And now,&#xD;
Rena, time presses. Having prepared&#xD;
your background, hasten to paint in&#xD;
your figures."&#xD;
. She understood me, evidently, for,&#xD;
setting down her empty glass, she began&#xD;
suddenly, and with more directness than&#xD;
I could have expected, to relate her&#xD;
"Romance of the Green Seal."&#xD;
Let me apologize here for many de-&#xD;
viations as to mere expressions from&#xD;
Rena's mode of narrative-the thread&#xD;
of which, however, is strictly observed,&#xD;
and the manner, also, as far as memory&#xD;
serves me, and a different mold of mind&#xD;
would admit, after the lapse of months,&#xD;
for it was not until long After I returned&#xD;
to my northern home, that I committed&#xD;
to writing the second portion of this&#xD;
story of real life, so deeply, painfully&#xD;
engrossing to my feelings.&#xD;
You know already, dear lady, that&#xD;
my mistress was Madam Aglate Maure-&#xD;
pas--Mle. Zavier before her marriage.&#xD;
&#xD;
Lk&#xD;
&#xD;
ss My master was nearly twenty years&#xD;
older than she, but was still considered&#xD;
It  a very handsome man, tall, commanding-&#xD;
ll looking, with black eyes, hair, and beard,&#xD;
nt an aquiline nose, fine teeth, smooth,&#xD;
r, though sallow skin, and a dressy, fash-&#xD;
ionable air. My mistress was seventeen&#xD;
when he first saw her at the opera, and&#xD;
vowed that she should be his wife. The&#xD;
thing seemed preposterous then. He&#xD;
had been a cruel husband to his first&#xD;
wife-a plain, but excellent woman,&#xD;
g whom he had married for her money.&#xD;
a- This was well known to her friends, and&#xD;
e, many persons believed his bad treatment&#xD;
f to have been the principal cause of her&#xD;
r death It is true, lie was rich and child-&#xD;
s  less; but, on the other hand, Mr. Francis&#xD;
g  Zavier was a famous merchant in those&#xD;
e days, having his principal house in Ha-&#xD;
e vana, though lie made New Orleans his&#xD;
e home, as it was his favorite place of busi-&#xD;
I  ness. His daughter was there a reigning&#xD;
belle, besides being very beautiful and gift-&#xD;
- ed, " a genius" was what they called her.&#xD;
. Providence placed my poor mistress&#xD;
in his hands at last. In the'great crisis&#xD;
of that year of thirty-seven, Mr. Francis&#xD;
Zavier was involved, and, after strug-&#xD;
gling a few months against his troubles,&#xD;
died of a broken heart, a bankrupt, leav-&#xD;
ing a widow and four children, the eldest&#xD;
of whom was Mademoiselle Aglite, the&#xD;
others, boys from eight to sixteen years&#xD;
old, unable, at that time, to make their&#xD;
own support.&#xD;
It chanced that my master held a&#xD;
claim  against Mr. Zavier's estate, in-&#xD;
dorsed by his wife, whose small private&#xD;
property, a plantation, was thus placed&#xD;
wholly at his mercy.&#xD;
He acted with great seeming gene-&#xD;
rosity on this occasion, and the end was&#xD;
an  understanding  between  him  and&#xD;
Madame Zavier, that inreturn for her&#xD;
daughter's hand, she was to have his -&#xD;
relinquishment. It was a perfect bar-&#xD;
gain and sale; yet I believe the mother&#xD;
thought she was doing the best thing&#xD;
possible for her child as well as herself,&#xD;
in encouraging, if not compelling, this&#xD;
marriage. Miss Aglae had no other at-&#xD;
tachment. She was averse, at first, but&#xD;
at last persuaded herself that she would&#xD;

learn to love Monsieur Maurepas when&#xD;
she got used to his ways and looks. And&#xD;
so. when eighteen years old, she mar-&#xD;
ried him-a man of upward of seven-&#xD;
and-thirty at the time, and wholly un-&#xD;
congenial to her in every way.&#xD;
"Ah, madam, that is 'the secret of&#xD;
married happiness after all-suitability,"&#xD;
said Rena, solemnly, " and nothing can&#xD;
make up for this want. They did not&#xD;
suit each other," she continued, in the&#xD;
same philosophic vein,." but, surely, this&#xD;
was no fhult of hers, for, who was there&#xD;
my master would have suited with his&#xD;
cruel, morose temper, his hardness, his&#xD;
profligacy, his cowardice ?"&#xD;
She ground the last word between her&#xD;
short, white teeth, as if it had been some&#xD;
obnoxious matter which she was trying&#xD;
to reduce to powder, and her eyes fairly&#xD;
flashed fire.&#xD;
" You hated your master, Rena ?"&#xD;
No madam, no ; I never hated him,&#xD;
except for her sake. Whatever he did&#xD;
to me and mine has been freely forgiven,&#xD;
long ago, as you shall hear when the&#xD;
end comes. I am not given by nature&#xD;
to hating any one."&#xD;
1 "&amp;amp;t persons of your blood are said&#xD;
to be revengeful. What was your own&#xD;
history, Rena?  How caine you in his&#xD;
hands?  Was he-"-&#xD;
I hesitated, but she understood me&#xD;
instantly.&#xD;
"No, madam, lie was no kin of mine.&#xD;
Hy father was a ship captain, a Swede,&#xD;
a brave, bold man, handsome, (I have&#xD;
his picture that shows for itself), good-&#xD;
tempered, affectionate. He was lost at&#xD;
sea when I was three years old, so that&#xD;
my mother and myself had to be sold&#xD;
for the benefit of his creditors. He had&#xD;
left us free in his will, but this, owing to&#xD;
his involvements, could not be carried&#xD;
into effect, and Monsieur Maurepas bought&#xD;
us together on the block. He made my&#xD;
mother his housekeeper at first, but grew&#xD;
dissatisfied with her, for his own reasons,&#xD;
and turned her out of his house, after&#xD;
beating her severely, with orders to set&#xD;
foot there no more. Then lie took in&#xD;
Phobe Reviere, who suited him better.&#xD;
After this,.my mother did the plantation&#xD;
se wing, being too delicate to work out.&#xD;
&#xD;
She had never done any thing harder than&#xD;
cleaning a house, or getting up fine linen,&#xD;
or a meal, in her life, and that for her own&#xD;
benefit, and had enjoyed every comfort.&#xD;
"At first she was very miserable, but&#xD;
afterward married Frederick Tanque,&#xD;
the foreman of the place, and was com-&#xD;
paratively happy again. He was hind&#xD;
to her, and their cabin was the best&#xD;
kept, and most spacious on the planta-&#xD;
tion. They had fig-trees, peaches, and&#xD;
plantains in plenty, in their inclosure,&#xD;
and fowls, and pigs, so that they were well&#xD;
supplied with food ; and, as they had no&#xD;
children, lived without much exertion."&#xD;
My mother worshiped the new mis-&#xD;
tress. She had never known the first&#xD;
Madani Maurepas, whose plain, white&#xD;
tombstone was placed in the grove near&#xD;
the sugar-mill--a sort of play-place for&#xD;
the children-and whose ghost was&#xD;
said to haunt the long lemon-tree walk&#xD;
that led to the mansion. My mother&#xD;
saw it herself, and though she had never&#xD;
seenthe first mistress, she described her&#xD;
to a hair afterward, even to a little halt&#xD;
in her walk, and the way she had of&#xD;
waving her hands as she went, and her&#xD;
strange, blue eyes, so dim and cold, and&#xD;
pale golden hair, faded and straight. It&#xD;
makes my blood creep but to think of it.&#xD;
She shuddered visibly.&#xD;
" You believed this, Rena ?" She look-&#xD;
ed at me with grave surprise ; then, drop-&#xD;
ping her eyes, said, with some asperity,&#xD;
"Certainly, madam. My mother was&#xD;
a truthful person, and a religous woman&#xD;
-a pattern for the whole plantation."&#xD;
I felt rebuked, more by her manner&#xD;
than her words. "But, it was not my&#xD;
mother's story I came here to tell you,"&#xD;
she continued, with a sad smile; "that&#xD;
would interest you, and such as you, but&#xD;
little: the story of a slave-what does&#xD;
it amount to ?" Again she mused.&#xD;
I thought of Keats' epitaph as an apt&#xD;
illustration, but made no further re-&#xD;
mark. I wished to throw no possible&#xD;
hinderances in her way, and yet she was&#xD;
mistaken in her assertion. " The story&#xD;
of a slave,", accurate, unbiased, natural,&#xD;
and the workings of a slave's own mind,&#xD;
under all circumstances, would be ene of&#xD;
the most interesting narratives the world&#xD;

find in it the keystone. of compensation,&#xD;
and receive thereby lessons yet un-&#xD;
dreamed "in our philosphy."&#xD;
I remember the day as well as&#xD;
though it was yesterday, when Master&#xD;
Richard knocked at my mistress' cham-&#xD;
.ber-door, and handed her a letter fastened&#xD;
with a green seal, continued Rena.&#xD;
It was a Saturday afternoon in Sep-&#xD;
tember, just four years to the very day&#xD;
after her marriage. Already she was&#xD;
alone in her bed-room, as she ever after&#xD;
remained, for master preferred his sepa-&#xD;
rate apartments in the wing-where he&#xD;
could go and come just as hie chose to&#xD;
do, and drink deep at night if it suited&#xD;
him.   The arrangement pleased   her&#xD;
more than lie liked to see. She felt so&#xD;
secure, so happy in the sole possession&#xD;
of her room, or rooms, rather, for she&#xD;
had a spacious dressing-room, and her&#xD;
bed stood in a windowed alcove, so that&#xD;
when the curtains were dropped, her&#xD;
chamber looked like a beautiful parlor.&#xD;
She kept her books, her secretary, and&#xD;
her harp there. On the last she played&#xD;
very finely, having been well taught&#xD;
this accomplishment at her convent. I&#xD;
mention all this to show you that it was&#xD;
not a breach of propriety for Master&#xD;
Richard to come to her sleeping apart-&#xD;
ments, as lie always did-a fashion&#xD;
more prevalent in the South, I suppose,&#xD;
than with you Northern people, who&#xD;
build so many stories to your houses, as&#xD;
I hear. The mansion of "Maurepas"&#xD;
was all on one floor, and every room&#xD;
opened by long windows on galleries, so&#xD;
none were very private.- The drawing-&#xD;
room was never used except for com-&#xD;
pany, nor the state dining-room. Two&#xD;
of the chambers were reserved for&#xD;
guests. The breakfast-room was only&#xD;
opened at meals, and in the two oppo-&#xD;
site wings hived my master and mistress.&#xD;
So you may see, dear lady, what sort of&#xD;
married felicity was theirs&#xD;
But, let me go back to that first&#xD;
letter, with the seal of her fate upon it-&#xD;
thme seal that seemed, from the very be-&#xD;
ginig, .to work with her like witch-&#xD;
craft. Madam, do you believe there is&#xD;
such a thing ?&#xD;
&#xD;
14        THE "'ROMANCE ' OF THE GREEN SEAL.??&#xD;
&#xD;
She asked the question so solemnly,&#xD;
so abruptly, that it startled me.&#xD;
" Magnetism is very like it, Rena, in&#xD;
its effects," I answered, gravely, " and I&#xD;
certainly believe in that; but the sources&#xD;
are widely different."&#xD;
"Madam, believe me or not, as you&#xD;
will, I am quite sure in my own mind&#xD;
that the 'green seal,' even more than the&#xD;
words written, was what bewitched my&#xD;
mistress, with the evil thing figured upon&#xD;
it that tempted Eve, and the magic writing&#xD;
beneath; but you must judge for your-&#xD;
self of this, from what I shall tell you."&#xD;
My mistress turned the letter over&#xD;
very carefully in her hand after she re-&#xD;
ceived it, and finally, before she broke&#xD;
the seal, read the superscription aloud :&#xD;
" To 'Valerie,' care of the post-mas-&#xD;
ter- at Claireforte, Belle-garde Parish,"&#xD;
and postmarked"Boston."&#xD;
" What can it possibly be ?" she asked.&#xD;
"Some Yankee scheme to get up a&#xD;
book of poems for nothing by contribu-&#xD;
tions, for a , benevolent purpose, of&#xD;
course," said Master Richard, smiling,&#xD;
with a sort of scorn.&#xD;
" I feel it is not -this, Richard," she&#xD;
said, as she broke it open, then grew&#xD;
silent in the perusal.&#xD;
Her face flushed all over, dimpled,&#xD;
sparkled, as she read, to the very end,&#xD;
then turning, she handed it to her cousin.&#xD;
" Read it yourself, Richard ; read it&#xD;
aloud ! It is the most beautiful letter I&#xD;
ever received in my life, even at the&#xD;
time when I received many such--the&#xD;
most poetic; and see what a noble hand-&#xD;
writing .forms the medium of all these&#xD;
lovely thoughts. Oh, who could have&#xD;
written it to me, to me, Richard," clasping&#xD;
her hands, and speaking as though she&#xD;
were one of the despised of the earth.&#xD;
Master Richard took the letter, a{little&#xD;
coldly, I thought ; then read it aloud, as&#xD;
she had desired him to do. The music&#xD;
of his voice suited the words so well&#xD;
that my ear was filled with delight, al-&#xD;
though I caught little of their meaning.&#xD;
I dropped my sewing, and, putting back&#xD;
my hair, listened with eager attention.&#xD;
My mistress clasped her hands and laugh-&#xD;
ed outright-her merry, bird-like laugh I&#xD;
" See, Richard, how Rena is transfixed.&#xD;

There must be strange magic in these&#xD;
mere 'words-words '-as Hamlet call-&#xD;
ed such-to charm even the child that&#xD;
can not understand them !"&#xD;
"Convincing proof, dear coz, on'this&#xD;
occasion, that the sound is better than&#xD;
the sense. The4 language is all very&#xD;
fine, but"--&#xD;
" But me no buts, Master Richard 1"&#xD;
she interrupted gayly, " and give me&#xD;
back my much-abused letter," (extending&#xD;
her hand at the same moment to receive&#xD;
it, then placing it in her waistband, next&#xD;
her heart). " There it shall lie, you&#xD;
envious, sneering philosopher, until it is&#xD;
worn to shreds; and for your punish-&#xD;
ment, I shall not call you into consulta-&#xD;
tion, fair sir, when I receive another."&#xD;
" Another, Agle ? Why, with all&#xD;
your womanly vanity-gratified by this&#xD;
fulsome piece of flattery, no doubt-you&#xD;
surely do not mean to answer this letter !&#xD;
Nay, fortunately, you can not," he adled,&#xD;
with a look of satisfaction at the sudden&#xD;
reflection-" for it is anonymous. I&#xD;
am glad of that, for your own sake."&#xD;
She made him a profound courtesy.&#xD;
" Wise oracle," she said; "you need new&#xD;
spectacles! There was just one little&#xD;
scrap, perhaps, at the bottom of that&#xD;
letter, you did not observe, not having&#xD;
eyes like mine, that promised me an-&#xD;
other intellectual treat before the moon&#xD;
should wane, and after that, perhaps&#xD;
other revelations may come to facilitate&#xD;
correspondence. What say you to this&#xD;
programme of mine, Great Solomon ?"&#xD;
" I appeal from Valerie tipsy (with&#xD;
praise) to Valerie sobered by reflection,&#xD;
that is all," said Master Richard, archly,&#xD;
yet not without a change of color, and&#xD;
an uncertain expression of the eye that&#xD;
always came to him when he was&#xD;
troubled in any way.    "And now,&#xD;
cousin, I must see about my horse."&#xD;
" My society is not stable enough for&#xD;
you, Cousin Zavier, it appears," she said,&#xD;
trying to appear unconcerned, yet really&#xD;
much annoyed. " See what a 'pundit'&#xD;

time, looking upon the floor. When she&#xD;
raised her eyes, I was standing before her.&#xD;
" What have I done to him, petite,&#xD;
to enrage him so ? And what in the&#xD;
world do you stand there for, making&#xD;
great eyes at me, as if I had committed&#xD;
some heinous crime ? Go directly, Rena,&#xD;
and put fresh rose-leaves in my drawers.&#xD;
Why have you neglected this?    Yet,&#xD;
stay ; it is too te now ; to-morrow will&#xD;
do as well. Don't leave me just now."&#xD;
A pause.&#xD;
"After all, is it not worse than a sin to&#xD;
be so pragmatical ?" she asked, turning&#xD;
away.&#xD;
" I don't know, mistress," I said, "what&#xD;
it is to be pragmatical."&#xD;
She laughed heartily.at my difficulty in&#xD;
pronouncing the word, which I repeated&#xD;
again and again after her. "Little goose.&#xD;
As if I were talking to you. What a&#xD;
literalist you are, to be sure! Can not&#xD;
one think aloud, sometimes, in one's own&#xD;
chamber,.without an eternal echo ?"&#xD;
I hung my head rebuked. "Come&#xD;
now," she continued, as if to revive me,&#xD;
"can you tell me what it is to be prag-&#xD;
matical---what the long, ugly, conse-&#xD;
quential word means, Rena ?"&#xD;
" I will look in the dictionary, mistress,&#xD;
if you'll tell me how it is spelled,'I said.&#xD;
She had taught me to do this readily,&#xD;
and it gave me great delight. "Never&#xD;
mind the dictionary this time, child&#xD;
You will not find all the meanings there,&#xD;
perhaps-all my meanings. To be prag-&#xD;
matical is to be dry and cross and hate-&#xD;

" Oh, mistress," I said, clasping my&#xD;
hands in a sort of pious horror of her&#xD;
behavior that I could not conceal; "how&#xD;
can you speak so of your own dear cou&#xD;

cherished secrecy will have to be compro-&#xD;
mised. Your proceedings against the&#xD;
postmaster of Claireforte, must be pub-&#xD;
lic, and in open court. In the mean&#xD;
time, he has matters pretty much in his&#xD;
own hands. So, take your farewell to-day&#xD;
of the unknown knight of the' Green&#xD;
Seal.' He comes to you no more 1"&#xD;
She trembled ; she turned pale.&#xD;
" What do you mean to do, Richard ?"&#xD;
she asked, in a piteous tone.&#xD;
"1To turn back the letters," lie replied,&#xD;
sternly," to him who sent them, through&#xD;
the postmaster of Boston, with the as-&#xD;
surance that 'Valerie' will in the future&#xD;
receive no such communications; or, to&#xD;
let them drift to the dead-letter office-&#xD;
which would you prefer ?"&#xD;
I never thought my Master Richard&#xD;
cruel until that moment. He must have&#xD;
known how he was harrassing her- Yet&#xD;
he looked wholly unconcerned.&#xD;
She laid her trembling hand upon his&#xD;
arm, and looked full into his face.&#xD;
" If you were to do either, I should hate&#xD;
you, Richard Zavier," she said, through&#xD;
her clenched teeth, still looking at him.&#xD;
I saw him shrink and shiver in turn.&#xD;
"Would this be possible for you,&#xD;
Aglae ?" he asked, " would it be possi-&#xD;
ble ?"  He spoke like one in a dream.&#xD;
Her only reply was a short, bitter laugh,&#xD;
and, leaving him abruptly, she advanced&#xD;
to meet her. husband, now returning to&#xD;
the steps with a gloomy look. She saw&#xD;
in a moment what was vexing him.&#xD;
"1They will hardly come to-night, Mr.&#xD;
Maurepas, I think," she observed ; " it&#xD;
looks so stormy, and the lake seems in&#xD;
such commotion already." One could&#xD;
see it very plainly from the portico--a&#xD;
wide, clear sheet of water, usually calm,&#xD;
but broken into white caps now-sur-&#xD;
rounded by plantations, many of them&#xD;
quite out of sight, however-i)deed, miles&#xD;
away. " I trust they will not come, if that&#xD;
cloud keeps its promise," she continued,&#xD;
" for their own sakes," and she pointed&#xD;
to one in the far west, small, black, rag-&#xD;
ged, yet dense, and defined as though a&#xD;
piece of broken slate had been suspended&#xD;
from the heavens.&#xD;
" Your chief hope,'after all, is, that I&#xD;
may be disappointed, no doubt. As to&#xD;
&#xD;
your anxiety for their safety, it does not&#xD;
amount to much, I take it," said Mr.&#xD;
Maur pas, sullenly ; "but, I tell you,&#xD;
madam, they will come, unless hell hides&#xD;
them to-night ; so make ready-and hark&#xD;
ye, Aglae, ice the wines this time ; don't&#xD;
forget it as you did last week, as if no&#xD;
one needed ice but yourself. Ice enough&#xD;
you have at heart, I should think, to&#xD;
keep you from thirsting for it," he mutter-&#xD;
ed; "but go, have the tables set out at&#xD;
once. We shall play late and commence&#xD;
early. Will you join us, Richard Zavier?''&#xD;
Elevating his voice in these last words,&#xD;
with a sneer that Master Richard took&#xD;
no notice of, for still he stood like a stone&#xD;
where my mistress had left him, with his&#xD;
arms folded on the balustrade, looking&#xD;
out on space,-as if he saw something no&#xD;
one else could see, coming from afar.&#xD;
Madam, I have thought, sometimes,&#xD;
since then, in looking back over all&#xD;
things that happened between then and&#xD;
now, that perhaps Master Richard had&#xD;
a sorrowful glimpse, at that moment, of&#xD;
what lay before my mistress-" second&#xD;
sight" some people call it. Any how,&#xD;
he never seemed exactly the same happy&#xD;
man afterward-to me, at least, who&#xD;
observed him so closely.&#xD;
My mistress did not go down to the&#xD;
great dining-hal-seldol used except&#xD;
for such occasions-to superintend mat-&#xD;
ters, as she usually did, on that evening ;&#xD;
but, giving her directions clearly and&#xD;
decidedly to the principal waiter, Julius&#xD;
Strong, she shut herself up in her room&#xD;
at once, taking me with her.&#xD;
" I have something here, Rena," she&#xD;
said, as she pressed her hand to her&#xD;
bosom, " to make amends for all. A rose&#xD;
has sprung up in my wilderness. Let&#xD;
me enjoy it. Now light the myrtle wax-&#xD;
taper, petite" (the closed shutters made&#xD;
it too dark to read, though still early),&#xD;
" and hold it close-close to me, while I&#xD;
read my precious letter. See, Rena,&#xD;
there is the envelop, child ! you may&#xD;
look at the seal, if you choose, and see&#xD;
what you can make of it," and she flung&#xD;
it to me, over the table by which she sat.&#xD;
" Oh, mistress," I said, setting down&#xD;
the taper (in my excitement, " it is a&#xD;
dreadful green snake, with its tail in its&#xD;
&#xD;
THE "ROMANCE OF THE GREEN SEAL."&#xD;
&#xD;
mouth-a snake, just like that master&#xD;
Richard killed last week, I believe. It&#xD;
makes my blood creep to look at it."&#xD;
" Foolish little creature ! It is the&#xD;
emblem of eternity, nothing more. But,&#xD;
how do you suppose I can read, with&#xD;
the taper a yard off, and with your silly&#xD;
interruptions ? Be silent, stand close to&#xD;
me ; shade the light with your hand, so&#xD;
as to throw every ray upon the paper, and&#xD;
to keep them from seeing the light outside,&#xD;
and look steadily at me, if you will look ;&#xD;
for, Rena," with her sudden smile, "I&#xD;
am entering my precious kingdom now.&#xD;
Behold ! I am putting on my crown."&#xD;
I felt quite awed at these words, and&#xD;
was as still as a mouse, thereafter, watch-&#xD;
ing her beautiful face, as she had bidden&#xD;
me do (though, glancing up, I could see&#xD;
no crown on her head), now covered&#xD;
with smiles, now quivering with emo-&#xD;
tion; and hearing, with amazement, her&#xD;
broken exclamations of delight and sur-&#xD;
prise, as she read sheet after sheet of&#xD;
the long, closely-written, sweet-smelling&#xD;
letter, quite to the end.&#xD;
Then she pressed it repeatedly to her&#xD;
lips, her breast, with her eyes uplifted as&#xD;
though she were mutely thanking heaven&#xD;
for the possession of such a treasure.&#xD;
"More beautiful, if possible, than the&#xD;
other "-she said, at last; "but, not for&#xD;
you, this time, oh ! cruel Richard, is its&#xD;
perusal. Never again shall mortal eyes&#xD;
come between me and my happiness !&#xD;
' 'Egeria!' he calls me his ' Egeria !'-&#xD;
implores an answering sign. Who am I,&#xD;
to dare to withhold it from my souls&#xD;
sovereign ?"  Then she mused. " Yes,&#xD;
yes, I will be happy, and in my own&#xD;
way. My body is in bonds and must&#xD;
remain so; but, thank. God, my soul is&#xD;
free ! And what a spirit from afar has&#xD;
taken shelter under its spreading wings&#xD;
at last! What a great, noble intellect--&#xD;
what a soul of fire has vailed itself in&#xD;
these pages ! What must the reality be&#xD;
-what, indeed ! But, of that, let me&#xD;
never dare to dream !" So she spoke, so&#xD;
~, she wrote; and, day after day, she would&#xD;
read aloud to me-or rather, to herself--&#xD;
the diary she kept, in which the progress&#xD;
of this " spiritual passion," as she called it,&#xD;
was set down, in words of flame.&#xD;
&#xD;
19&#xD;
&#xD;
But now she called to me to fetch&#xD;
her little sandalwood note box; and,&#xD;
taking from it her mother's letters, she&#xD;
placed them elsewhere for safety, and&#xD;
droped into its satin-lined depths two&#xD;
fresh ones-each  in its green-sealed&#xD;
envelope; then locking it, she slipped&#xD;
the key on her watch-chain, and smiled&#xD;
again as she gave me the box. " That is&#xD;
my treasure chest, Rena," she said, gayly.&#xD;
" There, place it in the armoire, and tell&#xD;
no one what it contains, as you value&#xD;
my life, child. And now, while I have&#xD;
a moment of time, speak your poem&#xD;
once again. I did not listen to it this&#xD;
morning, as I should have done; and&#xD;
you must have it perfectly when master&#xD;
Richard comes to-night."-&#xD;
The task she had set me was a little&#xD;
hymn, called " There is nothing true&#xD;
but Heaven," and I declaimed it to her&#xD;
entire satisfaction. Once a week a les-&#xD;
son of this sort was exacted from me by&#xD;
my young teacher; and often, as I lie&#xD;
awake at night, those childish lessons&#xD;
come back quite clearly to my mind, as&#xD;
if written on the wall ; and ever with&#xD;
them returns the light of those dear eyes,&#xD;
now faded forever.&#xD;
But I am rambling again from my&#xD;
story. Let me tell you what happened&#xD;
that night, as it had something to do&#xD;
with what came afterwards, and roused&#xD;
my mistress greatly, at the time, from&#xD;
all selfish dreams and considerations.&#xD;
Just as I had finished my recitation, a&#xD;
peal of thunder 'shook the house ; the&#xD;
lightning glared through the closed jalou-&#xD;
sies ; the.taper fluttered and died out in&#xD;
the blast, and the storm begun in all its&#xD;
equinoxial violence.&#xD;
My mistress went out presently, either&#xD;
to seek the protection of her husband&#xD;
anil master Richard, or to persuade them&#xD;
to come in and close the house against&#xD;
the approaching hurricane, I know not&#xD;
which. She found them together, sit-&#xD;
ting silently on the portico, Watching&#xD;
the foaming lake and gathering black-&#xD;
ness with an anxious and gloomy ex-&#xD;
pression on either face. Later they all&#xD;
came in to the breakfast-rotom, whither&#xD;
she had sent me 'with orders to Julius&#xD;
the waiter, and the tea-table had been&#xD;

&#xD;
laid, when they entered, with the beauti-&#xD;
ful decorated china.,&#xD;
" Could you not have waited a while,&#xD;
Aglite," asked my master, snappishly,&#xD;
" when you knew there were guests ex-&#xD;
pected ?" '&#xD;
" I thought they might be delayed,"&#xD;
she answered-" or-or "-hesitating-&#xD;
"not coming at all, in view  of the&#xD;
threatening tempest, and I hoped a cup&#xD;
of coffee, or tea, or chocolate might cheer&#xD;
you both. I am sure you seem to need&#xD;
cheering," she spoke affectionately, look-&#xD;
ing from one to the other; but neither&#xD;
face relaxed ; no one spoke further.&#xD;
No one ate a mouthful.   A cup of&#xD;
coffee was hastily drained by my master ;&#xD;
but master Richard and my mistress just&#xD;
tasted theirs. Both were ashen pale, as&#xD;
wilder and wilder rose the tempest with-&#xD;
out, and the house trembled and groaned&#xD;
-under the great pressure of the driving&#xD;
north wind.&#xD;
" Did you ice the wines, Julius ?"&#xD;
growled my master. " I suppose that&#xD;
has never been thought of, and they will&#xD;
be as hot as the devil, until midnight."&#xD;
"Yes, sah ; mistress sent me to do&#xD;
dat an hour ago."&#xD;
"Indeed ! wonderful to relate ! There&#xD;
are times, it seems, when it suits you to&#xD;
remember, madam !"&#xD;
" There are times and thim gs I am&#xD;
not permitted to forget, Leon' replied&#xD;
my mistress, mournfully.&#xD;
"You put out the, tables, of course,&#xD;
Julius; but have you lit the candles&#xD;
yet ?" he questioned.&#xD;
"No master; I thought I would wait."&#xD;
Thought 1 who told you to think,&#xD;
sirrah ?" thundered my master, stamp-&#xD;
ing his foot imperiously. " You know&#xD;
that, wet as they are, or will be,&#xD;
they will plunge right down there for&#xD;
dry garments. Are guests of mine to&#xD;
grope in the darkness, like bats ? Go&#xD;
instantly "-and he used an .oath, again&#xD;
stamping his foot and shaking his fist&#xD;
angrily, "and light every candle in the&#xD;
saloon. Do you hear me, you villain ?"&#xD;
No one dared to oppose him, and the&#xD;
order was carried out, useless as it seemed.&#xD;
There, in the great arched dining-&#xD;
room, with its pavement of white and&#xD;
&#xD;
black marble, the gaming tables were set&#xD;
out, with all the counter-boxes on them;&#xD;
the wines in the beaufet were in ice ;&#xD;
the cigars piled on silver salvers, with&#xD;
matches at hand; the candles lit-all was&#xD;
complete, except the expected guests,&#xD;
who came not ; until the ice had melted&#xD;
from the \vines that no lips of theirs&#xD;
might ever drain, and the candles had&#xD;
flared out almost to the socket, that no&#xD;
eyes of theirs might ever see; for never&#xD;
again in life did they enter the house of&#xD;
" Maurepas ;" and a cruel feast, indeed,&#xD;
was spread that night on the great dining-&#xD;
tables, hastily set together for the oc-,&#xD;
casion-a feast for death-the bodies of&#xD;
the three drowned gentlemen !  The&#xD;
storm was quite over by three o'clock in&#xD;
the morning, but the driving rain con-&#xD;
tinued, with the chill wind from  the&#xD;
north. The cold was intense, it seemed&#xD;
to us, so suddenly had it come after the&#xD;
heat of that sultry day; and all but my&#xD;
master and myself were still sitting up&#xD;
when Frederick Tanque, my step-father,&#xD;
came to the hall door.  He knocked&#xD;
very gently, calling at the same time, in&#xD;
a sad voice, to master Richard ; but I was&#xD;
aroused, and went out with my mistress&#xD;
to the portico to hear what his news was.&#xD;
My master still seemed to sleep heavily&#xD;
on the sofa, on which he had thrown&#xD;
himself, half buried in pillows.&#xD;
"Go back, Aglae, I implore you," said&#xD;
Master Richard, in an agitated voice,&#xD;
" this is no place for you." She obeyed&#xD;
him mutely; but I remained unnoticed.&#xD;
" Now, speak you, Frederick ; what&#xD;
have you to tell us ? Did the boat go&#xD;
down ?" he asked, hoarsely.&#xD;
"I fear so, master Richard."&#xD;
Are they all lost, Frederick, think&#xD;
you? have you seen any signs of this,&#xD;
and can it be ?", Frederick hesitated a&#xD;
moment, then spoke, in a clear whisper ;&#xD;
I shall never forget its strange distinct-&#xD;
ness, and how it thrilled me :&#xD;
" The bodies have drifted to shore,&#xD;
master Richard."&#xD;
" Oh, God!   All three, Frederick ?"&#xD;
he gasped.&#xD;
" All four, master Richard."&#xD;
The next moment a hand was on his&#xD;
throat.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was my master, whom we supposed&#xD;
still asleep in the breakfast-room.&#xD;
" Don't dare to tell me, you accursed&#xD;
villain," he muttered, " that the boy was&#xD;
one of them ! Unsay those words, Fred-&#xD;
erick Tanque ! or, choke until you die !"&#xD;
"For shame, Mr. Maurepas," said&#xD;
master Richard, interposing firmly, and&#xD;
removing his hand, which fell motion-&#xD;
less by his side. " Hear the truth like&#xD;
a man, and conceal it like a gentleman."&#xD;
" Speak, Frederick," said my master,&#xD;
hoarsely.&#xD;
"He is with them, sir," said my step-&#xD;
father ; " I am grieved to have to say so,&#xD;
for I loved him like my own; but bear&#xD;
it, master, like a Christian ; and see, my&#xD;
mistress is behind you," he added,&#xD;
hastily.&#xD;
She came forward, weeping bitterly,&#xD;
and wringing her hands. I tried to&#xD;
draw her back, but could not.   My&#xD;
master was walking the portico in the&#xD;
darkness now, like one distracted.&#xD;
We could only trace Frederick Tan-&#xD;
que by his lantern, as he strode away,&#xD;
followed by master Richard, who struck&#xD;
after him into the pitch darkness, guided&#xD;
by his light.&#xD;
"God save their sinful souls," I heard&#xD;
him mutter, as he rushed clown the steps,&#xD;
and then was lost to, sight. And still,&#xD;
the cold north wind was blowing, and&#xD;
the bitter north rain driving in my&#xD;
face. At last we went into the house,-&#xD;
as master harshly bade us do, and crept&#xD;
together close in the breakfast-room, on&#xD;
the broad., sofa, covered with the same&#xD;
shawl, and weeping, more from sympa-&#xD;
thy than sorrow ; for, after all, what were&#xD;
any of the victims to my mistress-M.&#xD;
Le Maitre, at the head of them ? Noth-&#xD;
ing, less than nothing ; yet, out of our1&#xD;
common humanity we mourned for them,E&#xD;
and my trouble had cause to be deeper&#xD;
.than hers, though I scarcely realized this&#xD;
yet, matters had passed so hurriedly.]&#xD;
.About an nour later my master came&#xD;
,in banging the front-door fiercely after ^&#xD;
him, and walking straight to the side-&#xD;
board, on which a decanter of brandy  i&#xD;
was sitting, he poured out a gobletful&#xD;
and drunk it off, then turned to my&#xD;
mistress, with a dreadful smile.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Are you satisfied, at last, madam?&#xD;
Are your prayers 'to the Virgin fully&#xD;
answered ?" he asked, in a cold, unnatu-&#xD;
ral voice. " They are all dead ; you&#xD;
hear ?. your enemies are all dead ! Le&#xD;
Maitre, and Gargaroux, and Eugene Mal-&#xD;
let-all three ' drowned-drowned,' as&#xD;
the bard of Avon has it," laughing bit-&#xD;
terly. "Ah, madam, you see I, too, can&#xD;
quote upon occasions."&#xD;
"Leon, these taunts are too dreadful&#xD;
at such a time. Forbear, I entreat you,"&#xD;
cried my mistress, sobbing bitterly.&#xD;
"I begin to believe, myself, in the effi-&#xD;
cacy of prayer," lie went on in a sneering&#xD;
way, "especially, when directed against&#xD;
those we hate. And you hated them.&#xD;
Why ?   Simply because they were my&#xD;
friends."  He laughed long. and loud&#xD;
at this sally, with a terribly hysterical&#xD;
violence.&#xD;
I was dreadfully frightened ; but my&#xD;
mistress, greatly shocked, wept on pite-&#xD;
ously, without offering further remon-&#xD;
strance against such unjustifiable treat-&#xD;
ment, yet, without seeming afraid~at - all.&#xD;
Indeed, when was she ever afraid ? -&#xD;
" So, now, you have me all to your-&#xD;
self, madam," lie continued, "as you&#xD;
have wished so long to have me, to hate&#xD;
and torture to the top -of your bent ; for -&#xD;
the comrades of my life are all gone,&#xD;
and you have given me no children to&#xD;
supply their places ; and what love was&#xD;
in me is dead from this henceforth;&#xD;
mark me, dead, with the poor frail crea-&#xD;
ture, whose life grew out of mine, and&#xD;
who clung to me beyond all else."&#xD;
She did not understand him alto-&#xD;
gether ; but, rising, she extended her&#xD;
arms to him with true emotion.&#xD;
" Oh, Leon," she said, "Oh, my hus-&#xD;
band, forgive me if I have wronged you,&#xD;
even in thought, and suffer me, still suf-&#xD;
fer me, to comfort, to love you."&#xD;
That moment was a pivot, madam,&#xD;
I have since thought, on which their fate&#xD;
was turning. It was an occasion lost.&#xD;
He pushed her rudely away, struck his .&#xD;
hend with his clenched fist, then shook&#xD;
.t fiercely in her face, without touching&#xD;
her, however. She shrieked faintly, stag-&#xD;
gering back.&#xD;

thundered forth, " if you don't want to&#xD;
madden me, and dry those cursed croco-&#xD;
dile tears before I come again, you and&#xD;
your yellow imp, or, by heavens, madam,&#xD;
it shall fare the worse with both of you."&#xD;
Then, cramming on his hat and throw-&#xD;
ing the shawl about him, which he tore&#xD;
from us,, lie burst from the apartment,&#xD;
and plunged into the cold rainy dawn,&#xD;
down in the direction of the lake shore.&#xD;
He met the men near there, assisted by&#xD;
Master Richard, bearing the bodies to&#xD;
the basement banqueting-room, and so&#xD;
turned back. My mistress had locked-&#xD;
herself in her own chamber, partly in-&#xD;
dignant, partly in pity for my condition,&#xD;
for I was terrified exceedingly, and great-&#xD;
ly grieved as well, and we heard nothing&#xD;
more until morning.'&#xD;
The day broke clear and cold, with&#xD;
the norther still blowing fiercely. My&#xD;
mistress went out at sunrise, leaving me&#xD;
asleep, and found Master Richard stand.&#xD;
ing out on.the portico, with a telescope&#xD;
in his hand. My master had been quiet-&#xD;
ed, by this time, and was slumbering in&#xD;
his own room after great excitement,&#xD;
caused partly, it was thought, by the fiery&#xD;
liquor of which he had drunk so deeply&#xD;
during the night.&#xD;
" Look through this glass, Aglite," he&#xD;
said to her, "and tell me what you see.&#xD;
My short-sighted eyes may have deceived&#xD;
me." She told my mother all this after-&#xD;
ward in my presence, for, as I said, she&#xD;
had left me sleeping.&#xD;
" I see a floating log, Richard, with a&#xD;
man lying on it, either asleep or dead,&#xD;
or is it the keel of a boat that he is&#xD;
clinging to-an overturned boat ?  No !&#xD;
he is not dead, only exhausted. He&#xD;
moves his hand ; lie tries to wave a&#xD;
handkerchief that he holds, but he has&#xD;
not strength, Richard, lie  has  not&#xD;
strength," she cried, "and he will perish&#xD;
miserably."&#xD;
He took the glass from her nerveless&#xD;
hand, and gazed long and earnestly.&#xD;
"I see every thing now," he said, " as&#xD;
plainly as you do, Agla; but the man&#xD;
shall not perish if we have time to get&#xD;
a boat manned to reach him before lie&#xD;
loses his hold. I will go to him myself."&#xD;
Then Master Richard went right to the&#xD;
&#xD;
boat-house, sent for Frederick Tanque to&#xD;
steer, and for two rowers, and when I&#xD;
got down to the'shore, where my mistress,&#xD;
was waiting, they were all ready to go&#xD;
out after the exhausted man.&#xD;
" God bless you, Richard," she said,&#xD;
as he turned to grasp her hand before&#xD;
he stepped into the boat; "you are al-&#xD;
ways first in good works." Then she&#xD;
threw her -arms about him and kissed&#xD;
him fondly, as I had never seen her do&#xD;
before. I knew she was thinking of her&#xD;
ill-humor to him the night previous, and&#xD;
sorry for it, as she ought to have been;&#xD;
and he felt this, too, I am sure, for the&#xD;
tears stood in his eyes, as lie pushed off&#xD;
from  shore. I could not help crying,&#xD;
too, from sympathy with him and her,&#xD;
and saying, as she had done, with up-&#xD;
lifted hands,&#xD;
" God bless you, my dear Master Rich-&#xD;
ard."&#xD;
The lake was still rough, and the&#xD;
progress of the boat was slow; but we&#xD;
watched anxiously for the deliverance of&#xD;
the sufferer, and had the satisfaction, at&#xD;
last, to see him lifted into 'the boat, and&#xD;
to hail its safe return to shore, with the&#xD;
poor haltdead form they had lifted from&#xD;
the wreck, now helpless as an infant, and&#xD;
only half-conscious.&#xD;
" Great heavens ! It is Claude Ro-&#xD;
quette," said my mistress, as she looked&#xD;
into his wan face, then poured reviving&#xD;
drops into his blackened lips.&#xD;
" Lose no time here, Aglite. Let us&#xD;
bear him to the house. Give me the&#xD;
flask. Have blankets warned, a bed&#xD;
prepared, women ready to rub him by&#xD;
the time we reach you. Go before us,-&#xD;
cousin; we may save him yet."&#xD;
All this was done in a wonderfully&#xD;
short space of time, and poor M. Ro-&#xD;
quette was laid in a warm bed and sur-&#xD;
rounded by attendants, before most per-&#xD;
sons could have given the mere necessary&#xD;
orders.  For my mistress thought of&#xD;
every thing at once, when the hour of&#xD;
need came, though she took her own&#xD;
time usually, and was even careless and&#xD;
forgetful sometimes.&#xD;
About breakfast-time my master rous-&#xD;
ed up from his stupor and came into the&#xD;
sitting-room, where. a cheerful pine-wood&#xD;
&#xD;
fire was crackling and throwing out a&#xD;
pleasant, balmy smell. The coffee was&#xD;
hot-every thing he liked best on the&#xD;
table ; but anger and gloom were fixed&#xD;
upon his features.&#xD;
My mistress was sitting at the head of&#xD;
the table, with her hand upon the silver&#xD;
coffee-pot, when he entered, (I can see her&#xD;
yet), as calm and unconcerned as if noth-&#xD;
ing had happened. I was at my usual&#xD;
post behind her chair. Master Richard&#xD;
was leaning against the mantel-piece,&#xD;
glancing over the "Delta." I don't know&#xD;
why I think of all these little things to-&#xD;
day, or why I trouble you with such&#xD;
small details ; but the picture rises be-&#xD;
fore me just as I saw it then, as clearly&#xD;
as if it were painted ; and I remember&#xD;
that it seemed to me' so hard-hearted&#xD;
that some should be eating and drinking,&#xD;
while others lay dead and cold in the&#xD;
basement below, and poor M. Roquette&#xD;
was wrestling sore with death in the ad-&#xD;
joining chamber.  But such contrasts&#xD;
must occur, or life would not be life;&#xD;
and it was all right, I suppose.&#xD;
When all were seated, and the coffee&#xD;
had been served, my master begun.&#xD;
I understand, madam,"   he said,&#xD;
" that you have a stranger within your&#xD;
gates this morning, and have been play-&#xD;
ing Good Samaritan, and al that sort of&#xD;
thing! Ye gods, how I hate hypocrisy !&#xD;
Richard Zavier, you might have caught&#xD;
better fish this morning, than Roquettes,&#xD;
I am thinking."&#xD;
Master Richard murmured something&#xD;
about " Christian duty," I forget what ;&#xD;
but my mistress, fixing her great eyes&#xD;
upon her husband's face, merely said,&#xD;
"Let us be thankful, Leon, that any&#xD;
one was saved from that doomed boat."&#xD;
My master sprung to his feet, and&#xD;
"i    brought down his fist with a great oath,&#xD;
upon the table.&#xD;
Do you mean to say," he roared,&#xD;
"that he, too, was in the Petrel?  Do&#xD;
you mean to say that the God you wor-&#xD;
ship, or pretend to, suffered those "-and&#xD;
lie pointed downward, toward the room&#xD;
in which they were lying dead--" to go&#xD;
down to death, and saved this worm--one&#xD;
wretch, that can not even swim ?"&#xD;
"Such was his will, M. Maurepas,"&#xD;
&#xD;
2 2       THE "ROMANCE OF THE GREEN SEAL."&#xD;
&#xD;
said Richard Zavier, sternly. " It is not&#xD;
for such as you or I to question it."&#xD;
" How came this creature in the so-&#xD;
ciety of gentlemen ?" he went on, wildly.&#xD;
" What - had he to do with the Petrel?&#xD;
Why did they not heave out their Jonas&#xD;
upon the waters, when the tempest came?&#xD;
The base-born hound ! his presence sunk&#xD;
the boat, I' doubt not. Curse him, curse&#xD;
him, now and eternally I"&#xD;
Madam, these things shock you; but,&#xD;
how can I give'you a just idea of M.&#xD;
Maurepas, otherwise than by giving you&#xD;
such details?  There is not much more&#xD;
of this to tell. My master rose from&#xD;
the table,,and commenced walking the&#xD;
room, wildly raving about poor Mr. Ro-&#xD;
quette and his low origin.&#xD;
" A vile overseer's son, to lie in the&#xD;
best chambers at Maurepas ! This is&#xD;
what I get for bringing beggars to pre-&#xD;
side over my household ! Misery loves&#xD;
company, they say. Le Maitre dead in&#xD;
the cellar-Roquette alive in the rose-&#xD;
wood chamber ! God, can it be borne"&#xD;
Then he laughed bitterly.&#xD;
"Ah, madam, he was not thinking of&#xD;
Le Maitre or-the other two when he raved&#xD;
thus, as you shall hear presently. I wqs&#xD;
astonished to see how Master Richard&#xD;
bore with him ; but he knew every thing.&#xD;
as we did not, and pitied him, even while&#xD;
he condemned.&#xD;
" Why was not Roquette taken to the&#xD;
overseer's 'house, madam ?" he asked&#xD;
abruptly of my mistress. ".The house his&#xD;
father used to occupy, and was kicked&#xD;
out of by me, was surely good enough&#xD;
for him. And why have you been med-&#xD;
dling in his recovery, as though it were&#xD;
any interest or business of yours? I de-&#xD;
mand an answer, madam, and a satisfac-&#xD;
tory one."&#xD;
"Mr. Maurepas I I have done no more&#xD;
than my duty in trying to restore Claude&#xD;
Roquette., All ranks are alike, at a time.&#xD;
like this and in sight of God ; nor have&#xD;
I ever, at any time, heard or known&#xD;
aught of this young man that was un-&#xD;
worthy of the first gentleman in the land.&#xD;
Be satisfied with this answer, I beg; I&#xD;
have no other to give ; and let the un.-&#xD;
pleasant subject drop."&#xD;
" You are an insolent fool, mattarii&#xD;

24        THE "ROMANCE OF THE GREEN SEAL."&#xD;
&#xD;
he muttered ; "and you, Richard Zavier,&#xD;
are a fanatical one ! There, take my&#xD;
parting opinion of you both, and make&#xD;
the best of it. And, mark ye, let this&#xD;
Claude Roquette be removed from here as&#xD;
soon as may be, alive or dead, or-"&#xD;
He went out, grumbling threats, and&#xD;
strode down again toward the lake-shore.&#xD;
Taking advantage of his absence, and&#xD;
that of my mistress and Master Richard,&#xD;
who went again to Mr. Roquette's room,&#xD;
whither they forbade me to follow them,&#xD;
I glided down the corridor and descended&#xD;
the broad flight of stairs that led to the&#xD;
basement halls below.&#xD;
It was with a trembling hand that I&#xD;
opened the door of that deathchamber.&#xD;
There they lay, all three, wrapped in&#xD;
their shrouding sheets, as my mother and&#xD;
the other women had placed them, with&#xD;
their hair still moist from the deadly lake-&#xD;
waters.&#xD;
M. Le Maitre wore a smile on his&#xD;
grim, handsome face, and his jet-black&#xD;
curls lay close and heavily on his mar-&#xD;
ble-white forehead. He was called the&#xD;
handsomest man in the parish. M. Gar-&#xD;
garoux was fearfully changed ; his own&#xD;
wife would never have known him. M.&#xD;
Eugene Mallet, the youngest, and the&#xD;
best of the three-where all were bad-&#xD;
seemed to be sleeping tranquilly. Poor&#xD;
fellow ! he was to have been married in&#xD;
the coming week, and the shock of his&#xD;
death nearly killed Miss Amelie Landry.&#xD;
But, apart from these, on a, low sofa&#xD;
(one of those on which the tired game-&#xD;
sters were in the habit of sleeping off&#xD;
their excesses, after morning broke, and&#xD;
the night's play was over), lay the young&#xD;
Pedro, the quadroon boy--him I had&#xD;
stolen down to take leave of-him to&#xD;
whom my master had referred so fiercely.&#xD;
He was a gentle and beautiful crea-&#xD;
ture, a year or two older than myself,&#xD;
and had been my play-mate since I could&#xD;
first remember. He belonged to M. Le&#xD;
Maitre, who had once lived with my&#xD;
master, in their bachelor days, and this&#xD;
boy's mother-the slave of the first-&#xD;
had been their joint housekeeper. She&#xD;
had been dead a long time, and my&#xD;
master and M. Le Maitre had been hag-&#xD;
gling for years over the price of the boy,&#xD;
&#xD;
whom my master was determined to&#xD;
have some day, I heard him say, if it&#xD;
cost him half his fortune. He was fond&#xD;
of Pedro, and kept him half his time at&#xD;
Maurepas, with Le Maitre's consent.&#xD;
But, as I have said, the last never could&#xD;
or would agree to receive any reasonable&#xD;
sum for him, and, partly from obstinacy&#xD;
my master hung back from the purchase,&#xD;
which he was still resolved to consummate&#xD;
before Pedro should be grown. Had he&#xD;
been my own brother, I could not have&#xD;
loved him better ; and I was kneeling by&#xD;
-and crying over the insensible body, with&#xD;
my head on my hands, and parting back&#xD;
sometimes the damp tangled hair, when I&#xD;
saw master come hastily in, and shut the&#xD;
door and lock it after him.&#xD;
Fortunately, the room was dim, and lie&#xD;
did not perceive me as he entered ; but&#xD;
my heart was in my throat, and I crept&#xD;
under the sofa as quickly and quietly as&#xD;
possible, and lay trembling there while&#xD;
his feet were almost touching me, for,&#xD;
passing the rest without notice, he came&#xD;
straight to the body of Pedro.&#xD;
The sounds that reached me from&#xD;
above were strange and appalling-more&#xD;
like the low howls of a wild beast in&#xD;
pain than a human creature in trouble.&#xD;
My master had thrown himself on the&#xD;
corpse, and was kissing it with frantic&#xD;
eagerness. I could hear this; and when&#xD;
I looked at it again, the cold waxen-like&#xD;
face was wet with his tears.&#xD;
" Oh ! Pedrq," he murmured ; " my&#xD;
boy, my poor, sacrificed boy ! the only&#xD;
thing that ever loved me except your&#xD;
dead mother.   There you lie, like a&#xD;
stone.  Make one sign, my son-but one&#xD;
-then I will believe every thing the&#xD;
priests tell me. Say, can you hear your&#xD;
father ? Can you forgive him, that he&#xD;
suffered you so long in other hands ?&#xD;
Or, is it all over with you my boy-all&#xD;
over with you, now and eternally."&#xD;
There was much more, but I remem-&#xD;
ber this only distinctly. After that his&#xD;
voice was choked again with sobs and&#xD;
curses. This was the first time I ever&#xD;
saw my master exhibit human feeling;-&#xD;
but all ended in a gloomy silence, and&#xD;
presently he went out, banging the door&#xD;
after him, and I heard his step grow&#xD;
&#xD;
fainter as it traversed the corridor and&#xD;
then passed out into the garden.&#xD;
He was going down to the lake-shore,&#xD;
as I found later, to meet the boats that&#xD;
were coming with the friends of the poor&#xD;
dead gentleien, to take them and Pedro&#xD;
away for burial.&#xD;
As soon as I could get out with safety,&#xD;
I ran to my mistress, by this time in her&#xD;
own room, to communic te to her all I had-&#xD;
seen and heard. She w s greatly moved.&#xD;
How   strange I never suspected this&#xD;
. "       before," she said; "and yet there was&#xD;
certainly a resemblance, now that I think&#xD;
of it-and such an attachment. Unrea-&#xD;
sonable it might have seemed to me, but&#xD;
for my own fondness for you, Rena."&#xD;
Then she mused, shaking her head&#xD;
piteously, and shedding silent tears.&#xD;
Rena," she said, suddenly, " you can&#xD;
keep your master's secret, I hope, as you&#xD;
have kept some of mine. Nay, you must&#xD;
keep it, or I will never love -or trust&#xD;
you again. Remember that you have&#xD;
stolen it, Rena, so to speak, and you must&#xD;
bury it deep, deep as Pedro in a grave."&#xD;
I understood her perfectly, and bent&#xD;
my head before her, and kissed her hand&#xD;
for all reply, and she was satisfied.&#xD;
"Poor Leon, lie suffers," she said after&#xD;
a time. " Oh ! would to God I dared to&#xD;
comfort him. I would give any thing in&#xD;
the world for such a privilege. My duty,&#xD;
certainly, if nothing more."&#xD;
" Would you give up your letters with&#xD;
the green seal, mistress ?" I asked, grave-&#xD;
ly, impelled by childish curiosity-not&#xD;
impertinence. It was very daring I felt&#xD;
V      the next moment.&#xD;
She bent her great, glowing eyes on&#xD;
me, as if to fathom my motive, before&#xD;
she answered,&#xD;
" Yes, in a moment, child. But, what&#xD;
business is that of yours ?  You must&#xD;
never dare again to question me on any&#xD;
subject, Rena."&#xD;
She was greatly agitated, I saw.&#xD;
" I will go" she said at last, " and&#xD;
see what I can do for him. They have&#xD;
borne the bodies away by this time, I&#xD;
suppose, and lie must be very wretched.&#xD;
Come with me, Rena; or, stay-it is still&#xD;
very chilly, I believe ; follow me with&#xD;
my shawl. &amp;amp; I shall need it."&#xD;
&#xD;
I was at her heels by the time she&#xD;
reached the portico, with  her great&#xD;
crimson cashmere on my arm. Master&#xD;
Richard was still with Claude Roquette,&#xD;
who now needed constant medical atten-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
The bodies were being placed in the&#xD;
boats by Frederick Tanque, Julius and&#xD;
the other men, aided by sorrowing&#xD;
friends. One small boat remained, how-&#xD;
ever, moored lower down than the rest,&#xD;
in which a little, old, odd-looking man&#xD;
was seated, gray, and yellow, and snuffy,&#xD;
with his hat off, and with eyes almost&#xD;
bleared with weeping, which he wiped&#xD;
constantly on his red bandana hand-&#xD;
kerchief. I can see him yet, just as he&#xD;
sat there-our gentle old overseer, whom&#xD;
all the slaves had loved, but who had&#xD;
been dismissed with great harshness, for&#xD;
this very cause every one of them&#xD;
thought. It was old .M. Roquette, who&#xD;
had come to learn the fate of his dear&#xD;
and only son, but who had been forbid-&#xD;
den t9 land by my master, and denied all&#xD;
satisfaction as to the condition of Master&#xD;
Claude.&#xD;
When he saw my mistress standing on&#xD;
the steps of the portico, he extended his&#xD;
hands in a mute, appealing way that was&#xD;
very affecting ; but if he said any thing,&#xD;
we could not hear it, with that dreadful&#xD;
wind still blowing.&#xD;
My mistress did not hesitate one&#xD;
moment-that was her way, madam.&#xD;
When she moved, she was quick as&#xD;
thought to act, and fearless as flame.&#xD;
Snatching her shawl from me, and throw-&#xD;
ing it around her shoulders, she flew&#xD;
down, bare-headed as she was, to the lake&#xD;
shore. I followed her as fast, trying to&#xD;
pluck her gown and draw her back, for I&#xD;
knew nothing would exasperate my mas-&#xD;
ter more than such interference.&#xD;
The boats had pushed off when we&#xD;
gained the shore-all but old M. Ro-&#xD;
quette's, which lay rocking and bounding&#xD;
on the unquiet water. My master was&#xD;
cursing and abusing the old man vio-&#xD;
lently.&#xD;
." You old gray-headed scoundrel," he&#xD;
cried, " be off, before I thrash your feeble&#xD;
life out of your miserable, shriveled body.&#xD;
No man shall transgress my orders, nor&#xD;

carcass shall be sent to you. Now, tak&#xD;
to your oars in a minute, or- Ha&#xD;
madam, you here ? You seem omniprec&#xD;
ent to-day, really."&#xD;
She did not regard him any more tha&#xD;
if lie had not spoken, but stepped riglh&#xD;
on to the boat, and stood so near the gun&#xD;
wale that the water lapped her feet.&#xD;
She was perfectly splendid that day&#xD;
still dressed in her white robe and scar&#xD;
let shawl, with her black hair flying in&#xD;
the wind, her crimson cheeks, her flash&#xD;
ing eyes, that gave out such red light&#xD;
sometimes, and her haughty, outstretched&#xD;
hand, waving back all interference.&#xD;
Old Mr. Roquette crept feebly toward&#xD;
her, wailing like a woman. She leaned&#xD;
forward and clasped his hand, with such&#xD;
a noble, affectionate grace, such a beam-&#xD;
ing smile, that it did my heart good.&#xD;
" Don't cry, Mr. Roquette," she said.&#xD;
" Mr. Claude is doing well ; he willlive--&#xD;
Dr. Richard Zavier says so-and I will&#xD;
be his nurse by day and night, if needful,&#xD;
until he is restored to you. Don't you&#xD;
believe me, Mr. Roquette ?" seeing that&#xD;
the old man shook his head doubtfully.&#xD;
Ah t madam," he said in his broken&#xD;
way, "you are one angelle!  You mean&#xD;
to comfort me, I know ; but don't mock&#xD;
my hopes, for God's sake !"&#xD;
And again he raised his withered&#xD;
hands, and tried to clasp them together-&#xD;
but they trembled so he could not.&#xD;
"Mr. Roquette, do you see this ?"&#xD;
She had drawn her crucifix from her&#xD;
bosom--the emblem of her faith and his.&#xD;
" By this holy cross I swear to you that&#xD;
what I have said is truth."&#xD;
My master had stood like one rooted&#xD;
to the spot until this moment. Now he&#xD;
sprung forward, and, seizing her arm,&#xD;
dragged her away, darting a terrible look&#xD;
over his shoulder, with the word "be-&#xD;
gone " flung toward old Mr. Roquette,&#xD;
coupled with a curse.&#xD;
I trembled for her safety ; but when&#xD;
they reached the portico, his brutal mood&#xD;
seemed relaxed, for, loosing his hold on her&#xD;
shoulder, lie pushed'her away--anid turn-&#xD;
ing into the breakfast-room, lay there all&#xD;
day, his face buried among the sofa pillows. I&#xD;
&#xD;
I I&#xD;
&#xD;
a, Toward evening my mistress went to&#xD;
is him with kind and loving intentions,&#xD;
:e carrying a cup of coffee in her hand, by&#xD;
t  way of excuse for her intrusion.&#xD;
s- He raised himself up fiercely, as she&#xD;
entered, gazed at her long and fixedly,&#xD;
n then striking the cup from her hand, lay&#xD;
t down again with a muttered curse.&#xD;
- I dared not gather up the fragments&#xD;
then ; but, withdrawing from the room&#xD;
with my mistress, we went at once to&#xD;
the chamber of Monsieur Roquette, where&#xD;
she commenced that arduous watch that&#xD;
- lasted many days, for a nervous fever&#xD;
t  had set in, and with that poor delicate&#xD;
young man it was almost as fierce a strug-&#xD;
gle now between life and death as had&#xD;
been waged in the overturned boat.&#xD;
I    My master never mentioned Mr. Ro-&#xD;
quette's name again, but maintained a&#xD;
moody silence, while he remained at Mau-&#xD;
repas, ashamed of his conduct, perhaps,&#xD;
or absorbed in his own grief and disap-&#xD;
pointment. The behavior of my mis-&#xD;
tress toward him at this time was more&#xD;
than commonly kind and respectful, but&#xD;
it seemed to make no impression upon&#xD;
him. He rarely noticed her at all, not&#xD;
even to sneer, and gave himself up to&#xD;
gloomy abstraction.&#xD;
As soon as it was possible to remove&#xD;
him, Master Richard conveyed M. Ro-&#xD;
quette to his own room, at Claireforte, and&#xD;
there attended him, with the assistance of&#xD;
his father, until he was quite strong and&#xD;
hale again. The poor young man tried&#xD;
to express his thanks to my mistress for&#xD;
all her kindness, the night before he left&#xD;
us, but failed to do more than kiss her&#xD;
hand devoutly, and bathe it with his tears.&#xD;
All he could stammer out was a&#xD;
prayer that God might permit him to do&#xD;
something to serve her in return--" some-&#xD;
thing, any thing 1"'&#xD;
" That time may come sooner than we&#xD;
think, M. Roquette," she said, gravely ;&#xD;
" but in the interval, rest assured that&#xD;
your recovery, and the thought of your&#xD;
father's joy have already more than re-&#xD;
paid any efforts of mine." In parting&#xD;
lie hung a gay rosary around my neck,'&#xD;
and promised me a string of gold beads&#xD;
for New Year's. They came ; I have&#xD;
them yet. Each one outweighs a half&#xD;

THE "ROMANCE OF THE GREEN SEAL."      31&#xD;
&#xD;
Poor, foolish wretch that I was. I had&#xD;
no heart to give.&#xD;
Rena sighed, crimsoned, turned away.&#xD;
There was a tear in her eye when she&#xD;
bent it on me once more, that never fell,&#xD;
but seemed swallowed back again into&#xD;
the depth of the black, lustrous orb&#xD;
from whence it sprung.&#xD;
I thought I penetrated the secret of&#xD;
that reluctant drop ! It is sacred with&#xD;
me.&#xD;
It was at New Year, I remember,&#xD;
that Master,.Richard paid us one of his&#xD;
monthly visits. He brought my mistress&#xD;
a beautiful rosewood writing-desk, rich-&#xD;
ly inlaid and filled with exquisite paper,&#xD;
sealing-wax and pens - all she could&#xD;
want for correspondence. There was a&#xD;
seal, too, one of her own devising, which&#xD;
he had caused to be engraved on an&#xD;
onyxtstone, set in gold, for her.It rep-&#xD;
resented a falcon hooded, perched on a&#xD;
hand, to the wrist of which it was fast-&#xD;
ened by a chain. Above were inscribed&#xD;
the words in French, " Je verrais."&#xD;
How well I recognized Rena's de-&#xD;
scription.&#xD;
Ah, Richard, this is too much," she&#xD;
.      said, smiling through her tears, "that&#xD;
z     you should have recollected this whim&#xD;
of mine, mentioned and forgotten by&#xD;
me so long ago; it is, indeed, most kind&#xD;
and unexpected. The seal is beautiful.&#xD;
I shall always use it hereafter, in my&#xD;
choicest correspondence." Stooping, she&#xD;
kissed his forhead lightly, suddenly.&#xD;
I saw that lie was agitated. " You&#xD;
remind me at once, dear coz, in your&#xD;
sa     playful, ironical way, what a dead letter&#xD;
after all this seal must be to you, and how&#xD;
useless a present I have brought, since&#xD;
you  have no correspondents !   That&#xD;
'Ariel' affair is over, of course. Besides,&#xD;
it was altogether one-sided, while it last-&#xD;
ed; you never replied, Aglae ?"&#xD;
He spoke interrogatively, hesitating&#xD;
between each of these last words, most&#xD;
painfully, I thought.&#xD;
"What an idea, Richard. After all,&#xD;
what made you think of that so sud-&#xD;
denly ? I thought the matter was drop-&#xD;
ped by tacit consent between us long&#xD;
ago." She spoke playfully, with spark-&#xD;
ling eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
"11hope so, at least, Aglie," le an-&#xD;
swered gravely, "for the good of all;&#xD;
and now, dear coz, I want you to make&#xD;
me a promise." He took her hand and&#xD;
looked her, steadily in the face as hie&#xD;
spoke. "Promise me that your name&#xD;
and picture shall be ever sacredly with-&#xD;
held from all anonymous or unknown&#xD;
correspondents, however earnestly so-&#xD;
licited. Promise, me this, Agliae, if you&#xD;
love me-if you respect yourself and&#xD;
me !"&#xD;
"I do, -Richard," she answered with&#xD;
downcast eyes and real feeling I could&#xD;
see. " I do most sacredly promise you&#xD;
to observe this reasonable request."&#xD;
"More, Aglite, more ! Promise me-"&#xD;
She laid her ivory fingers across his lips,&#xD;
while a shadow of severity crossed her&#xD;
countenance, interrupting thus what he&#xD;
would fain have added.&#xD;
"No more, Richard ! I will promise&#xD;
nothing more; nor must you ask it.&#xD;
Neither will I reply to any questions on&#xD;
this subject. My soul is absolutely my&#xD;
own, until God calls for it."&#xD;
He put her hand aside; lie groaned&#xD;
and bent his head down upon his hands.&#xD;
When he looked up she was gone. I&#xD;
was alone with him, engaged in binding&#xD;
the velvet slippers my mistress had em-&#xD;
broidered for his New-Year's gift, and&#xD;
seated in my low chair in the chimney-&#xD;
corner.&#xD;
"4What do you know of all this,&#xD;
Rena ?" he asked. I stared at him&#xD;
vaguely ; the cold dew came to my fore-&#xD;
head. What could I refuse to tell Mas-&#xD;
ter Richard should lie persist in asking&#xD;
me? " Say," he said, rising impulsive-&#xD;
ly ; and, coming toward me, he stood&#xD;
before me, placing his hand on my head&#xD;
so as to raise my face and force me to&#xD;
look upward. " Does she still receive&#xD;
those letters with the green seal? .Does&#xD;
she write in return? You know--ob-&#xD;

know all that she does. For her sake&#xD;
answer me. Rena ! these questions are&#xD;
not vain! Tou can help nme to pluck&#xD;

she is drifting, and your duty is plain&#xD;

32        THE "ROMANCE OF THE GREEN SEAL."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Master Richard," I said, firmly, "you&#xD;
told me once that it was as bad as&#xD;
eavesdropping for any one to try and&#xD;
find out what was not intended for him&#xD;
to know ; I have always tried to keep&#xD;
this rule ever since."&#xD;
He lifted his hand from my brow,&#xD;
and raised it to his own. "My God !"&#xD;
he said, " my God, I see how it is! I&#xD;
saw it from the first ; yet I am fallen low&#xD;
indeed, to deserve such a rebuke as that,&#xD;
and from such lips !"&#xD;
"Master Richard," I said ; " dear Mas-&#xD;
ter Richard," dropping my work and&#xD;
falling on my knees before him ; " I did&#xD;
not mean to be impertinent, indeed I&#xD;
did not. If you wanted my heart's&#xD;
blood, you should have it. Nay, forgive,&#xD;
me; don't be angry with me, dear Mas-&#xD;

" Child, foolish child, get up ! There!&#xD;

quiet ; you unman me ; and heaven&#xD;
knows the burthen I have to bear is al-&#xD;

hesitated. "Be faithful, be pure of heart,&#xD;
and withal be silent. All may yet go&#xD;
well. Noble natures are self-purifying.&#xD;
Good wine works, through its fermenta-&#xD;
tion,' to keep for ages."  He was speak-&#xD;
ing to himself now, I well knew. " Thus&#xD;
will her heart, I trust ! Poor sacrificed&#xD;
child."&#xD;
He mused long, standing there by the&#xD;
hearth, never even looking at me again,&#xD;
gazing into the embers as though he&#xD;
could read the future in the wavering&#xD;
coals. At last he wheeled off suddenly&#xD;
-and left the room. A moment later&#xD;
I heard my mistress talking to him on&#xD;
the portico. Through the open window&#xD;
I heard her urging him to marry Miss&#xD;
Sophie Landry, the sister of the young&#xD;
lady who was engaged to M. Eugene&#xD;
Mallet, and a lovely girl as the sun ever&#xD;
shone upon.&#xD;
lie was warding off the matter as well&#xD;
as he could, without being too positive,&#xD;
when, all at once, I heard her say:&#xD;
" Richard, I do begin to believe you&#xD;
have a previous attachment that makes&#xD;
you adhere so.obstinately to your bache-&#xD;
&#xD;
lor's estate. Answer me truly, cousin;&#xD;
is it so ?"&#xD;
His voice was husky and broken, as&#xD;
he said: " I, too, may be permitted, I&#xD;
trust, to have my reservation, Aglae.&#xD;
This is a subject on which you must&#xD;
not touch again-must not, mark me,&#xD;
cousin.&#xD;
" Oh Richard, Richard, how hard you&#xD;
are !  I thought, you told me every&#xD;
thing." She was sobbing bitterly now,&#xD;
I could hear, but he Was implacably&#xD;
silent. He came to the window at last,&#xD;
and looked in. Madam, his face was&#xD;
like a piece of stone !&#xD;
" Bring some cologne for your mis-&#xD;
tress, Rena, quickly ; and a vail. The&#xD;
air is too chilly out here; her eyes&#xD;
suffer." There needed no such explana-&#xD;
tion for me. I flew for the articles,&#xD;
carried them to her myself. As I had&#xD;
supposed, her eyes were red with weep-&#xD;
ing; but he did not offer to assist her in&#xD;
any way, or to soothe her, but sat by per-&#xD;
fectly passive. And so they separated,&#xD;
coldly at last.&#xD;
"This seems very inconsistent with&#xD;
what you have told me of Richard&#xD;
Zavier, Rena-a piece of petty, spiteful&#xD;
malice only. How did you account for&#xD;
it ?"&#xD;
" Oh,.madam, it was not in her na-&#xD;
ture to suffer dumbly as he did. He&#xD;
was always locked up and cold when in&#xD;
deep trouble ; that was his way. And&#xD;
her words had stirred the deep waters !&#xD;
They were thoughtless, to say no more."&#xD;
" You do not think -"&#xD;
" Oh ! madam, do not ask me what I&#xD;
think," she interrupted hastily, " only&#xD;
what I know. You, too, may have your&#xD;
thoughts, perhaps, before I end my story&#xD;
--of me, as well as others. If so, I be-&#xD;
seech you not to utter them or to ques-&#xD;
tion me, of what must even seem uncer-&#xD;
tain, because never expressed or ex-&#xD;
plained."&#xD;
The rest of that visit of Master Rich-&#xD;
ard's was a very sad one. He was talk-&#xD;
ing most of the time thereafter of his&#xD;
lost mother, of his dear young sisters,&#xD;
and the good governess he had obtained&#xD;
for them-an English lady, middle-aged&#xD;
and highly educated, and what comfort&#xD;
&#xD;
he promised himself from their progress&#xD;
and prosperity. He spoke, too, much&#xD;
of his anxiety for the eternal welfare of&#xD;
my mistress, and begged her to read&#xD;
some books that he would send her,&#xD;
carefully and constantly. But she would&#xD;
not promise to do so, and this grieved&#xD;
him, I could see.&#xD;
On New Year's day my master had&#xD;
his usual grand dinner party. My mis-&#xD;
tress was beautiful in her ruby-colored&#xD;
velvet, and diamonds, and Mechlin laces.&#xD;
Poor Master Richard !   That day&#xD;
how I pitied him. Every thing seemed&#xD;
to jar upon his feelings, and he rose, on&#xD;
some slight plea, and went out to wan-&#xD;
der, before the dessert was laid. But&#xD;
my mistress was gayer than I ever had&#xD;
seen her. I saw her start once, though ;&#xD;
it was when -my master called to Julius&#xD;
to bring in the new champagne with&#xD;
the green seat I, too, felt chilled for a&#xD;
moment ; but he meant no more than he&#xD;
said. It seems it was some rare wine&#xD;
just from Europe, that his commission&#xD;
merchant had sent him with many other&#xD;
brands.&#xD;
But, as I have told you, matters went&#xD;
on securely, with regard to the letters,&#xD;
for a year or more, and in this time my&#xD;
mistress lived her full life of happiness.&#xD;
About this time a shadow of suspicion&#xD;
seemed to fall over ,my master's mind.&#xD;
How it first gathered there, I never knew,&#xD;
except from his own observation. Old&#xD;
Pierre  Riviere  and his family could&#xD;
have had no clue to my business at&#xD;
Claireforte.  I had always done small&#xD;
errands in the shopping line for my&#xD;
mistress, and went no oftener now than&#xD;
before. Young Roquette, we knew,&#xD;
would have died. at the stake before&#xD;
making the slightest revelation to any&#xD;
one, even to his own father, on the sub-&#xD;
ect of my mistress' concerns, and Mas-&#xD;
ter Richard was not to be thought of in&#xD;
such a connection, even if he had known&#xD;
what he only conjectured.&#xD;
I was the first to suspect my master's&#xD;
suspicions, from his own manner to my&#xD;
mistress, which she never observed at&#xD;
all. He would watch her often, at that&#xD;
time, through his half-closed eyes, with&#xD;
a sort of sneering smile upon his features&#xD;
&#xD;
that I knew of old, muttering to himself,&#xD;
sometimes, after she had passed him-&#xD;
muttering and cursing low, and laughing&#xD;
bitterly, as if his very soul was steeped&#xD;
in gall and wormwood.&#xD;
When I told my mother and step-&#xD;
father of this strange habit of his, add-&#xD;
ing that it made me fear for her safety, but&#xD;
never mentioning a syllable of my own&#xD;
suspicions as to its cause, they seemed to&#xD;
think it was his own embarrassments-&#xD;
debts and loss s at play, that were press-&#xD;
ing on him an   oading him almost to&#xD;
madness.&#xD;
One of our men was hired as head&#xD;
steward on a New Orleans packet, and&#xD;
had heard his master's affairs freely dis-&#xD;
cussed by various parties, more than&#xD;
once at the table, and gathered that he&#xD;
was on the brink of ruin.&#xD;
" We shall all be sold at public ven-&#xD;
due, and that will be the end of it," said&#xD;
Frederick Tanque, gloomily. "Fami-&#xD;
lies will be scattered, homes broken up,&#xD;
comforts destroyed, and, worst of all, the&#xD;
poor young mistress-what is to become&#xD;
of her ?"&#xD;
"What, indeed.!" echoed my trem-&#xD;
bling mother, who had never forgotten&#xD;
that day on which the horsewhip fell,&#xD;
for her sake, on those snow-white shoul-&#xD;
ders.  " Blessed angel !  Poor, sweet,&#xD;
beautiful bird ! The thought of her&#xD;
trouble is harder to bear than all. You,&#xD;
too, my poor Rena; raised like a lady,&#xD;
unfit for hardship-what will become of&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
" Oh, I am to be free, you know,&#xD;
mother," I said, cheerfully. "Don't fret&#xD;
about me. Don't you remember how&#xD;
master gave a deed for me to my mis-&#xD;
tress, when she first took me to wait on&#xD;
her? He offered to buy her a diamond&#xD;
cross to match those her father gave her,&#xD;
she told me; but rhe said she would pre-&#xD;
fer a deed for me, and that was{ because&#xD;
she meant to set me free whenever I got&#xD;
married."&#xD;
Frederick Tanque shook his head.&#xD;
" What did that scrap of writing amount&#xD;
to, Rena ? Just done to please her, and&#xD;
to save the diamonds--that was all I&#xD;
You belong to master as much as you&#xD;
ever did, and will go where the rest go,&#xD;

34        THE " ROMANCE OF THE GREEN SEAL."&#xD;
&#xD;
I understand it all; the more the pity,&#xD;
for that's half my trouble."&#xD;
" But, Master Richard had it all at-&#xD;
tended to I tell you, Papa Frederick.&#xD;
Ten days afterward it was recorded, he&#xD;
called it. I have often heard him say so,&#xD;
and mistress went to see about it, her-&#xD;
self, about two years ago, with Master&#xD;
Richard. He made her go and read it&#xD;
with her own eyes in a book at the court-&#xD;
house. ' For that is all the property&#xD;
you have in this world, Agllae,' I heard&#xD;
him say; ' now be sure it is secured to&#xD;
you. I may be dead when this question&#xD;
arises, and you must know your own af-&#xD;
fairs. Besides, in justice to the poor&#xD;
spoiled child, you ought to be able to&#xD;
carry out your good intentions.' I am&#xD;
quite sure of all this," I added. This&#xD;
soothed them greatly; still they con-&#xD;
jectured all sorts of suffering for my&#xD;
mistress, should the plantation be sacrifi-&#xD;
ced, and were much amazed to hear me&#xD;
boldly assert that she could support her-&#xD;
&amp;amp;sef by writing books, as ladies in the&#xD;
North did, while I washed her clothes&#xD;
and prepared her meals and saved her&#xD;
all petty vexations.&#xD;
As for my master, I took no concern&#xD;
for his welfare. ie was out of the ques-&#xD;
tion. The very mildest fate I craved for&#xD;
him was the eternal calaboose ! Not so&#xD;
Frederick Tanque. He yearned over&#xD;
him with a strange, almost fraternal af-&#xD;
fection, for they had been boys together,&#xD;
play-fellows, and, so far, he had been&#xD;
seldom mistreated by his master-that&#xD;
is to say, not in any very violent way,&#xD;
beyond curses and rough words, which&#xD;
all about him had to hear. Later his&#xD;
feelings altered, for the sake of one he&#xD;
loved as his own child, and reared, for&#xD;
her white blood, as he could not have&#xD;
done for offspring of his-the daughter'&#xD;
of his wife.&#xD;
That wife, that mother, lived not to&#xD;
see the day he prophesied, though near&#xD;
at hand, and I thank God for it ! But&#xD;
Frederick Tanque-a proud man, if a&#xD;
slave-survived to pass under the yoke&#xD;
of another, harsher rule ; and finally&#xD;
die fghtngdesperately in the swamps.&#xD;
MaaIwill not pierce your tender&#xD;
heat wththat history, nor rouse my&#xD;
&#xD;
own; but, this much I believe-the&#xD;
master of slaves has a very different ac-&#xD;
count to render for the trifling away of&#xD;
property, from him who lets houses, or&#xD;
ships, or stock slip from him, or lands&#xD;
even. He has human souls to reckon&#xD;
about with his God !&#xD;
Rena bent forward on her hands, as&#xD;
she frequently did, in one of those paus-&#xD;
es which, with her, usually succeeded&#xD;
every passionate outburst ; and again I&#xD;
waited many minutes, -silently, if not&#xD;
impatiently, for her to resume her tedi-&#xD;
ous and digressive, yet ever earnest and&#xD;
deeply impressive narrative.&#xD;
" Your master grew suspicious, Rena ?"&#xD;
I said, at last. " Did he betray . this&#xD;
openly, and how ?   I hope poor M.&#xD;
Roquette did not suffer ?" The question&#xD;
roused her.&#xD;
" No, no indeed. He was beyond his&#xD;
reach. It was on Master Richard that&#xD;
the storm burst forth at last. It was a&#xD;
strange freak in my master, that, after&#xD;
their long cousinly friendship and inti-&#xD;
mate weekly achs7tion, lasting through&#xD;
years, now that Master Richard came&#xD;
but once a month, at most, and was far&#xD;
more reserved than formerly in his man-&#xD;
ner-and that my mistress thought less&#xD;
about him than she had ever done be-&#xD;
fore, 9ven if she cared as much-this&#xD;
sudden, make-believe jealousy should&#xD;
arise.like a tempest, and sweep all scru-&#xD;
ples before it."&#xD;
It was all in connection with this cor-&#xD;
respondence which my master had some-&#xD;
how scented out-blindly,though, at bes.,&#xD;
and not to his own satisfaction, knowing&#xD;
merely of its existence. How, I never&#xD;
could tell. There was nothing else that&#xD;
lie objected to; he never even pretended&#xD;
that there was.&#xD;
I never knew how he opened the sub-&#xD;
ject to a man he respected as he did&#xD;
respect Richard Zavier, in spite of all his&#xD;
bad treatment and scornful ways toward&#xD;
him. I was passing by the library door&#xD;
where they both were, when I saw Master&#xD;
Richard, pale as a corpse, standing be-&#xD;
fore my master, defending himself earn-&#xD;
estly, with uplifted hand, from some&#xD;
charge that had been brought against&#xD;
lum. I could not forbear lingering a&#xD;

&#xD;
moment in the corridor to hear what he&#xD;
was saying.&#xD;
L" But I swear to you, by all that is&#xD;
sacred to man, that you are deceived," I&#xD;
heard Richard Zavier say. "I must not&#xD;
be so wronged. Produce your evidence&#xD;
-you say you have it, and make your&#xD;
charge more distinct than the mere in-&#xD;
sinuation you haveiurged, of unjust and&#xD;
clandestine effort to divide man and&#xD;
wife. I am 'incapable of any thing of&#xD;
the kind, M. Maurepas. After all, what&#xD;
arc you driving at ?  Speak out, or&#xD;
swallow your own words 1"&#xD;
" I have made some rules in my house&#xD;
on the subject of letter-writing," my&#xD;
master replied,coolly, " with which you&#xD;
have been interfering of late, I suspect,&#xD;
by a clandestine and underhand manner.&#xD;
Letters arrive almost weekly for Madame&#xD;
Maurepas, not one of which she suffers&#xD;
me to see or hear of, when she can help&#xD;
it. This savors of conspiracy, Richard&#xD;
Zavier ! and you are undoubtedly the&#xD;
author of these secret and closely-sealed&#xD;
epistles."&#xD;
"Is it thus you approach me with&#xD;
your proofs, M. Maurepas," said Master&#xD;
Richard, scornfully. " I demand these&#xD;
The time is past for questions and replies&#xD;
to which courtesy, justice even, might&#xD;
have given precedence over positive as-&#xD;
sertion, unsupported as this is by one&#xD;
bare fact."&#xD;
" You deny this, then, Dr. Zavier ? Do&#xD;
I so understand you ?" My master rose.&#xD;
"I have already denied all intent to&#xD;
injure you," said Master Richard, with a&#xD;
suddenly faltering tongue and downcast&#xD;
head. New thoughts had come to cow&#xD;
him. You would have, thought him the&#xD;
criminal then, madam, had you seen&#xD;
him. I knew that some mighty struggle&#xD;
was waged in his noble heart, beyond&#xD;
any eye of man to penetrate. The iron&#xD;
had entered his soul; he cared only to&#xD;
save her now.&#xD;
In another moment, in obedience to&#xD;
my own summons, my mistress had en-&#xD;
tered the room, and stood calmly before&#xD;
them. " What is the matter, Richard ?"&#xD;
she said. " M. Maurepas, what is this ?&#xD;
Are you not quarreling, and about me?&#xD;
Oh, I hope not, I hope not !" -&#xD;
&#xD;
My master faced her with a bitter&#xD;
smile. Master Richard still stood, silent&#xD;
and downcast. She continued to look&#xD;
eagerly for tome time from one to the&#xD;
other, with outstretched hands.&#xD;
"Have 1 any thing to do with this&#xD;
affair ?" she asked, at last. "I have a&#xD;
right to know."&#xD;
"Every thing, madam, every thing,"&#xD;
replied her husband, fiercely. " I was&#xD;
just interrogating Richard Zavier on the&#xD;
subject of that interesting correspond-&#xD;
ence you and he have been conducting&#xD;
so successfully, ever since (I suppose so,&#xD;
at least), the rosewood desk and its con-&#xD;
tents came to Maurbpas. I ask to be&#xD;
enlightened. Will you," grinding his&#xD;
words between his clinched teeth, "fita-&#xD;
vor me with an explanation ?"&#xD;
" Of what, M. Maurepas ?"&#xD;
I was amazed at her calmness, though&#xD;
she,too, had grown white as death.&#xD;
" Of the contents of these letters, and&#xD;
their intent and purpose, if you please,&#xD;
madam," lie pursued, more coolly, "the&#xD;
letters of Madame Maurepas, and Dr.&#xD;
Richard Zavier, I mean. You under-&#xD;
stand me perfectly," he sneered,&#xD;
" None such have ever been written&#xD;
that I know of, M. Maurepas."&#xD;
" Aglae !" The word of warning,&#xD;
probably against the greater danger to-&#xD;
ward which she was drifting, broke from&#xD;
the lips of Richard Zavier in tones of&#xD;
agony indescribably pathetic. A whole&#xD;
world of self-sacrifice and heart-broken&#xD;
disappointment and regret seemed in&#xD;
that one familiar word-of reproach,&#xD;
perhaps.&#xD;
" You stand convicted, madam, by&#xD;
that reproving tone," said my master,&#xD;
severely, but without so far losing the&#xD;
dignity lie had assumed on this occa-&#xD;
sion. " Your accomplice is too consci-&#xD;
entious, it seems, to sustain your shallow&#xD;
falsehood. Henceforth, it is best that&#xD;
you see each other's faces no more. Go,&#xD;
Richard Zaviel, and be thankful that&#xD;
you take your life with you. As for&#xD;
you, madam," and hie advanced as if to&#xD;
seize her arm, but .she sprung aside and&#xD;
avoided him.&#xD;
"I must be heard," she said, lifting&#xD;
high her hand, in which was clinched&#xD;
&#xD;
"I           .   . .               - ---- -                        - -   - --i -  kv - 9-&#xD;

36        THE "ROMANCE OF THE GREEN SEAL."&#xD;
&#xD;
that small, sharp dagger she often wore.&#xD;
" I, who have never uttered a lie. Now,&#xD;
I swear, sacredly swear, in the sight of&#xD;
God, that Richard Zavier is innocent of&#xD;
this correspondence, if such there be;&#xD;
and that to him the pain of such reve-&#xD;
lation, were it true, would exceed any&#xD;
thing a tyrant and a despot like you,&#xD;
Leon Maurbpas, could feel or suffer from&#xD;
such a cause."&#xD;
" Beware, madam; beware how you&#xD;
enrage me beyond appeal," cried my&#xD;
master, his eyes growing bloodshot as&#xD;
he spoke. " You have more reason than&#xD;
you know of to tremble-even if what&#xD;
you assert be true."&#xD;
" To tremble," she. repeated, with a&#xD;
curl of scorn on her lip, while her cheeks&#xD;
grew crimson, and that look came to her&#xD;
eyes, so terrible to all who saw it. " It&#xD;
is you who should tremble, dastard that&#xD;
you are. Do you know what it is for&#xD;
matter to contend with spirit ? I will&#xD;
teach you, Leon Maurepas. There is&#xD;
lightning -enough in my veins to blast&#xD;
you as you stand. Approach me one&#xD;
step nearer if you dare-if you dare "&#xD;
And again she lifted the clinched&#xD;
poignard, with a wild and bitter laugh&#xD;
that froze my blood. " Tyrant, I defy&#xD;
you 1" she cried.&#xD;
Madam, this was the first time she had&#xD;
ever spoken a disrespectful word to him in&#xD;
her life, or evidenced temper beyond mere&#xD;
looks. It sobered him strangely for a&#xD;
few moments. He seemed surprised, con-&#xD;
founded even, and looked appealingly to&#xD;
Richard Zavier.&#xD;
" After all," he said, " Cousin Richard,&#xD;
you may be as much in the dark about&#xD;
this matter as I am. Help me- to get&#xD;
things straight again, if you can, and&#xD;
lead that mad woman away."&#xD;
" Touch me at your peril, Richard&#xD;
Zavier," she cried, as he approached her ;&#xD;
she was excited now-almost beyond&#xD;
the power of discriminating between&#xD;
friend and foe-her eyes were filled with&#xD;
that terrible red light. Master Richard&#xD;
returned to the position he had left, aind&#xD;
stood again, with downcast eyes and&#xD;
folded arms, in the window, cut to the&#xD;
very heart of hearts, I saw.&#xD;
I burst into the room now with wild&#xD;
&#xD;
and frantic weeping, and falling down,&#xD;
seized my mistress round her knees, beg-&#xD;
ging her for the love of God to come&#xD;
away. She followed me mutely. Then&#xD;
they were left together, those miserable&#xD;
men. What occurred we knew not fur-&#xD;
ther than this-that Master Richard left&#xD;
Maurepas that evening, to return no&#xD;
more, and that my master, a few days&#xD;
later, went off, none knew whither, and&#xD;
was absent a month, at the expiration&#xD;
of which time he returned and was re-&#xD;
ceived by my mistress as urbanely as if&#xD;
nothing had ever occurred to disturb&#xD;
their peace.&#xD;
My master was more respectful and at-&#xD;
tentive to her than he had been for&#xD;
months, and brought her various pres-&#xD;
ents, books even, which he had seldom&#xD;
given her before. She never read one&#xD;
of these, I remarked, but laid them&#xD;
away, untouched, in their splendid bind,&#xD;
ings, in the library. I saw, however,&#xD;
what she did not appear to notice, that&#xD;
his watchfulness was unabated, and that&#xD;
he scarcely left the house now, or suffered&#xD;
her to do so unattended. I had been&#xD;
closely watched, I knew, by Pierre&#xD;
Riviere and his family during my&#xD;
master's absence; but nothing had been&#xD;
discovered, although I had gone twice to&#xD;
Claireforte for letters, and had brought&#xD;
back, on one of these occasions, a minia-&#xD;
ture to my mistress of her unseen cor-&#xD;
respondent.&#xD;
" Did you see it, Rena," I asked, not&#xD;
without emotion.&#xD;
" Yes, madam, once. My mistress&#xD;
never showed it to me again, because I&#xD;
said Master Richard was the handsomer.&#xD;
I liked his clear, dark, pale face better&#xD;
than that fair, florid countenance, with its&#xD;
great blue eyes, waving golden hair and&#xD;
pointed beard."&#xD;
" )o you remember the style of fea-&#xD;
ttres, Rena ?" The question was im-&#xD;
pulsive and irresistible.&#xD;
" Napoleonesque," my mistress called&#xD;
it, I remember, madam.   The name&#xD;
struck me as strange, and I retained it;&#xD;
the features were fine, I think, the face&#xD;
rather short and broad, the under lip&#xD;
full, the upper long, pointed and smiling,&#xD;
both very red-a brilliant face, like&#xD;
&#xD;
sunshine, but not sweet and steady lik(&#xD;
Master Richard's. The shoulders wer&#xD;
broad, I remember, and .Isaw at a glance&#xD;
that they belonged to a powerfully made&#xD;
npan. The picture was painted on ivory&#xD;
and set in gold, to be fastened to a chain.&#xD;
" Did she wear it always, Rena ?"&#xD;
"No, madam, not then ; she was afraid&#xD;
to do this. She concealed it with her&#xD;
letters, in the sandal-wood box. While&#xD;
my master was gone, she caused a small&#xD;
square opening to be made in the floor&#xD;
under her bedstead, and nicely joined&#xD;
again, with a movable lid. They were&#xD;
hidden there, the letters and the picture.&#xD;
Frederick Tanque did the work for her,&#xD;
with his own hands, and she enjoined&#xD;
him to silence."&#xD;
"How determined she must have been&#xD;
on her course-how reckless even," I&#xD;
murmured.&#xD;
" Madam, her life was in these letters.&#xD;
She could not give them up. . She used&#xD;
to tell me that matters had changed&#xD;
places with her strangely since this cor-&#xD;
respondence entered into her very soul.&#xD;
Realities had grown to seem but shadows&#xD;
now, and these shadows had come to be&#xD;
her sole realities. Life was nothing to&#xD;
her without this love !"&#xD;
"Ah, Rena, would that she had died&#xD;
then !"&#xD;
The quadroon gazed sadly at me for&#xD;
a moment.&#xD;
}Y       "Ay, madam, I can say amen to&#xD;
this with a pure conscience. Would she&#xD;
had died then; but the vision that struck&#xD;
me to the floor insensible was not given&#xD;
for nothing, and she was appointed to live&#xD;
and see the dark tissue completed-steel&#xD;
and blood had still their work to do!"&#xD;
I gasped back a reply, unnoticed by&#xD;
her as she sat, with her head-bent down&#xD;
upon her bosom, her hands clasped, her&#xD;
feet thrust forward, her whole attitude&#xD;
one of self-absorbed melancholy. I de-&#xD;
termined tointerrupt her no more--that is,&#xD;
if I found it possible to restrain myself.&#xD;
It was so long before she roused again&#xD;
from these moods of silent abstraction,&#xD;
that interest itself could scarcely sustain&#xD;
my patience, I feared, to the end of her&#xD;
digressive narrative. It was some time&#xD;
before she again proceeded.&#xD;
&#xD;
e     ' It was nearly a fortnight after my&#xD;
e master's sudden return, when I set forth&#xD;
one evening to go to Clairefourte for a let-&#xD;
ter, carrying another carefully concealed&#xD;
in my bosom to be posted by young M.&#xD;
Roquette. There were two roads to the&#xD;
village ; one led through the swamp,&#xD;
longer and less pleasant than the 'river&#xD;
road, but far more private. I took this&#xD;
one on this occasion, and saw nothing&#xD;
more startling than a gopher, a squirrel,&#xD;
a parroquet, or a moccasin-snake on the&#xD;
road, until I reached the post-office. I&#xD;
hitched my pony, and went in through&#xD;
the back door of the building-a long,&#xD;
dark, narrow store, with the post-office in'&#xD;
the rear, when I saw my master come up&#xD;
the front steps, immediately facing me,&#xD;
but nearly a hundred feet off. I was&#xD;
sure he did no observe me, but I shrank&#xD;
into the shadow, prepared to remain&#xD;
silently there until M. Roquette sliould&#xD;
come down in my direction. The store&#xD;
was quite full of customers, and I knew&#xD;
I might have to wait a long time where&#xD;
-there were so n i ny to serve, unless&#xD;
some one came for a letter.&#xD;
It was not many minutes, however,&#xD;
before I saw my master and M. Roquette&#xD;
walking down the store together to-&#xD;
ward, the post-office. I shrank behind&#xD;
the side counter, and they passed with-&#xD;
out observing me.&#xD;
They went into the office, which was&#xD;
so near that I could hear every word&#xD;
they spoke from the low seat I occupied,&#xD;
through the latticed partition.&#xD;
"You have acted in defiance of-the&#xD;
law, M. Maurbpas," I heard M. Roquette&#xD;
say, after a moment, "in turning over all&#xD;
those letters and reading their superscrip-&#xD;
tions ; but I hope at last you are satisfied.&#xD;
There is none, you see, for your wife."&#xD;
"And do you pretend to say, you&#xD;
infernal little puppy,' my master said,&#xD;
" that none such ever pass through your&#xD;
hands? No palavering now ; answer&#xD;
me directly, sir, directly."&#xD;
"Put your questions plainly ; I hard;&#xD;
ly understand -you," stammered M. Ro-&#xD;
quette.&#xD;
" Listen, then, imnblaile, and compre-&#xD;
hend. Do letters, directed to Madame&#xD;
Aglite Maurepas, come to your post-office,&#xD;

38        THE "ROMANCE OF THE GREEN SEAL."&#xD;
&#xD;
or do they not?  Be careful how you&#xD;
evade this straightforward question. I&#xD;
have a right to know, and I ,shall con-&#xD;
sult the registers if I have reason to&#xD;
think you are lying to me, cowardly&#xD;
little hound !" with a terrible oath that I&#xD;
will spare you, madam. " Prick up your&#xD;
ears and answer, then, on peril of-"&#xD;
"1I am willing to take my oath in a&#xD;
court of justice," interrupted M. Ro-&#xD;
quette, not frightened now, but deter-&#xD;
mined, I knew  from  the sound of his&#xD;
voice, " that no such letters come to this&#xD;
post-office, or pass through my hands.&#xD;
Madame Maurepas has no correspon-&#xD;
dents that I know of.  Now, sir, spare&#xD;
me your insults, and your presence on&#xD;
these premises in the future, Ientreat !"&#xD;
This last word was spoken more like&#xD;
an order than a prayer, I thought. I&#xD;
-       was astonished at Mr. Claude's spirit,&#xD;
and so would you have been, madam,&#xD;
could you have seen him-a little man,&#xD;
with a small, sleek, black head, carried&#xD;
chiefly on one side ; a short, smiling,&#xD;
sallow face, and a step like the hop of&#xD;
a canary bird. But he had a fearless&#xD;
eye, I remember that, and was as quick&#xD;
with a pistol as any one, though it was&#xD;
against his conscience to go armed.&#xD;
" What did you give for these goods,&#xD;
Roquette, and what price did your fath-&#xD;
er pay for his house ? tell me that be-&#xD;
fore I leave your presence," my master&#xD;
asked in his most insulting tone.&#xD;
Not knowing his suspicions, M. Ro-&#xD;
quette could not imagine of course that&#xD;
he was accusing him of trickery.&#xD;
"'My gratitude, Monsieur Maurepas,&#xD;
that was the price I paid," replied Mr.&#xD;
Claude, warmly.           0&#xD;
"Are you sure your honor was not&#xD;
included, Roquette ? A small matter is&#xD;
thrown in, sometimes, when a good bar-&#xD;
gain is concluded between friends, and&#xD;
that would have scarcely been an dddi-&#xD;
tional feather's weight, I take it."&#xD;
The intention was apparent now !&#xD;
M. Roquette's vice was altered with&#xD;
rage when he replied: "Do not esti-&#xD;
mate mine by your own, M. Maurepas,&#xD;
or you may do some one injustice." lie&#xD;
stammered when excited. " And now,&#xD;
M. Maurepas, if your search is over, we&#xD;
&#xD;
will part on the terms I at first suggest-&#xD;
ed, if you please-eternally, sir, and&#xD;
immediately."&#xD;
" With all my heart, M. Roquette, un-&#xD;
til it suits my convenience to come&#xD;
again. Is that the packet I hear blow-&#xD;
ing off steam ?  I must be off right&#xD;
speedily. I have business to settle at&#xD;
the landing," and to my great relief my&#xD;
master rushed forth and galloped off.&#xD;
" That will detain him half an hour&#xD;
at least," I thought. " Let me hurry and&#xD;
be gone." In. another moment the letter&#xD;
I held was exchanged for one sealed&#xD;
with the green seal, and directed to Va-&#xD;
lerie, and I was again galloping home-&#xD;
ward, by the river road this time. I&#xD;
was afraid of the swamp, so late-afraid&#xD;
of getting. lost when the dusk should&#xD;
close, which would be the case before I&#xD;
reached Maurepas. Besides that, I felt&#xD;
sure my pony would carry me half way&#xD;
home before master thought of leaving&#xD;
the steamboat.&#xD;
I was mistaken. Just as I got oppo-&#xD;
site that island which my mistress called,&#xD;
from some whim, "King Arthur's Barge"&#xD;
-the same I described before, with its&#xD;
dim outlines and gigantic trees, like&#xD;
masts-I heard the quick thud and hab-&#xD;
itual blow of master's great bay horse,&#xD;
"Cortez," and glancing behind, I saw&#xD;
him coming after me in a hard hand&#xD;
gallop. But he did not call to me&#xD;
to stop, as I feared he would, nor pass&#xD;
me and wait for me, as I dreaded he&#xD;
might -do; but, as soon as he got quite&#xD;
close to me, he slackened rein and kept&#xD;
behind me in a leisurely way for more&#xD;
than a mile, so that my suspicions were&#xD;
almost disarmed when we reached the&#xD;
alder grove.  I had no opportunity-&#xD;
not the slightest-all this time to make&#xD;
any provision for the safety of the let-&#xD;
ter, in case he should suspect and seize&#xD;
me fpr examination. It lay concealed&#xD;
in my bosom, it is true ; but this would&#xD;
have been no safeguard had he deter-&#xD;
mined to possess it, I well knew. My&#xD;
worst fears were realized at last, though&#xD;
unexpectedly, too, for I had begun to&#xD;
hope I might reach home undisturbed.&#xD;
When we entered The alder grove, my .&#xD;
master stopped and called to me to halt,&#xD;
&#xD;
which I did instantly, trembling in every&#xD;
limb. He never kept his cruel eye off&#xD;
of me, I knew and felt all this time,&#xD;
except for one instant, when he dis-&#xD;
mounted to hitch his horse to a low hang-&#xD;
ing limb, and turned his back on me for&#xD;
a moment.    That instant was worth&#xD;
every thing to me. Quick as light Iliad&#xD;
transferred the precious letter from my bo-&#xD;
som to a hole I remembered to have seen&#xD;
that day under the flap of the old saddle&#xD;
I was riding on, and had thrust it in far&#xD;
among the' stuffing when   he turned&#xD;
again. I had matured. this plan as I&#xD;
rode along before him, and, come what&#xD;
might, I felt now that she was saved,&#xD;
and drew a long breath of relief, even&#xD;
though I saw him cutting switch after&#xD;
switch  from  the alder  bushes, and&#xD;
watching me closely all the time with&#xD;
his cat-like, cruel eyes, that spoke as plain-&#xD;
ly as words what his intentions were.&#xD;
At last he spoke to me: "Rena, where&#xD;
is that letter M. Roquette gave you this&#xD;
evening for your mistress ?"&#xD;
"What letter, master ?" I asked, tremb-&#xD;
ling like a poplar leaf.&#xD;
"You know well enough what letter&#xD;
I mean, deceitful mink," he answered.&#xD;
"Dismount. I shall whip you until&#xD;
you tell me the truth or hand me the&#xD;
letter."&#xD;
&#xD;
It was vain to think of resistance. I&#xD;
got offmy pony and hitched him where&#xD;
he motioned to me to fhsten him,&#xD;
which was done carelessly enough, it&#xD;
seemed later, for he broke loose and gal-&#xD;
loped home like mad, and that brought&#xD;
Frederick Tanque to see about me, as&#xD;
you shall hear, but not until life was&#xD;
nearly gone, and vengeance itself satisfied.&#xD;
Madam, I spare you -the dreadful de-&#xD;
tails. This was the first time I had&#xD;
ever been whipped ; it was the last.&#xD;
Suffice it to say, I was resolute through-&#xD;
out, to die rather then betray my mis-&#xD;
tress. It is not so hard as people think&#xD;
to keep such a resolution when the mind&#xD;
is once excited. It is in the beginning&#xD;
of punishment that one's spirit quails.&#xD;
It seems to rise, the more the body suf-&#xD;
feis-the more the blood flows, so that&#xD;
I can understand how those old martyrs&#xD;
sung amid curling flames, and died in&#xD;

ecstasy that rose above their fleshly&#xD;
' destruction, though terrified at the dread-&#xD;
ful preparations, and finally got in such&#xD;
a state of mind they could not yield.&#xD;
The last I remember of my suffering&#xD;
was the thought that I was dying, and&#xD;
for her ! Then I felt Frederick Tanque&#xD;
untying the cravat with which my mas-&#xD;
ter had fastened my hands behind me,&#xD;
and bathing my face with brandy, and&#xD;
pouring some down my lips, perhaps-&#xD;
I do not know ; then all was dark.&#xD;
Afterward, I heard that he had threat-&#xD;
ened his master's life on this occasion; but&#xD;
whether this was true or not, I know not.&#xD;
If so, M. Maurepas had the prudence or&#xD;
generosity to pass it by unpunished ; but,&#xD;
from that hour, Frederick Tanque hated&#xD;
his master far more than he had ever&#xD;
loved him, and relaxed all his previous&#xD;
efforts to take care of his affairs, about&#xD;
which he had been so faithful and un-&#xD;
tiring.  As for my mother, I shall&#xD;
always think the shock of my condition&#xD;
killed her, weak and sickly as she was,&#xD;
and wholly unprepared for such treat-&#xD;
ment in my case, petted and defended&#xD;
by ihy mistress as I had been. She&#xD;
broke a blood vessel then, and died&#xD;
within the year. But, as I have said, it&#xD;
was all the better for her (seeing how&#xD;
matters. were bound to go), that she&#xD;
should be cold in her grave.&#xD;
" But your mistress, Rena ?"&#xD;
" Ah, madam, my first thought on&#xD;
coming to myself was of her, and I&#xD;
whispered, they said: 'Don't tell her&#xD;
how he whipped me,' to those around,&#xD;
then relapsed again into partial uncon-&#xD;
sciousness, from time to time muttering&#xD;
her name."&#xD;
"She came to you, of course ?"&#xD;
"He would not let her I He kept her&#xD;
locked in her own chamber for a week,&#xD;
forbidding any one to approach her ex-&#xD;
cept the daughter of old Pierre Riviere-&#xD;
Phoebe, a bad and deceitful girl, his princi-&#xD;
pal spy, and we all thought too near to the&#xD;
master by half. During this time, the&#xD;
servants heard my mistress moianin&#xD;
piteously, and calling sfor me and her&#xD;
cousin Richard.   At last, Julius, u&#xD;
waiter, forced his way in with a cup our&#xD;
tea--when my master had gone down&#xD;

THE "ROMANCE OF THE GREEN SEAL."       41&#xD;
&#xD;
to the lake, and begged her on his knees&#xD;
to drink it, for she would take nothing&#xD;
but iced water. He took this occasion&#xD;
to tell her all he knew of me-that he&#xD;
had seen me sitting up that day-the&#xD;
fifth from that fearful ride, and that&#xD;
the doctor said I would soon be out&#xD;
again, and able to attend her as usual.&#xD;
" Do, dear mistress," he said, "bear&#xD;
up better. Master Richard will soon be&#xD;
here; he has been sent for to come to&#xD;
you, I believe."&#xD;
This was a story of his, madam, just,&#xD;
to get her to eat and drink, and to rouse&#xD;
her up. So she took the tea and toast&#xD;
that he had carried her, and rallied from&#xD;
that hour, but looked vainly for her&#xD;
cousin Richard. As for Phoebe, the pow-&#xD;
er Julius had, kept her silent, for he&#xD;
knew of some thefts she had committed,&#xD;
and held a rod over her through this&#xD;
knowledge. A day or two after, urgent&#xD;
letters came from New Orleans and my&#xD;
master left hurriedly, leaving old Pierre&#xD;
in charge of watch and ward.&#xD;
But my mistress was herself again&#xD;
by this time, for I had crept up to her&#xD;
chamber-door, feebly, it is true. She&#xD;
sent through me for Julius and Fred-&#xD;
erick Tanque, and ordered them to ex-&#xD;
pel Pierre and Phoebe from her house,&#xD;
and to bring back to her service her&#xD;
favorite woman, Rhoda; and when my&#xD;
master returned, a week later, things&#xD;
were going on pretty much in the old&#xD;
order of management. He never said&#xD;
a word-to show that he disapproved--&#xD;
if, indeed, he was not really relieved by&#xD;
the stand my mistress had taken.&#xD;
Before I forget, let me tell you she&#xD;
never got that letter which I had stuffed&#xD;
into the saddle.  When I got well&#xD;
enough to search for it, I could not find&#xD;
it, and soon after my mother gave the&#xD;
saddle away to her old fellow-servant,&#xD;
Deemah's mother, madam. The saddle&#xD;
belonged to my mother ; but she knew&#xD;
she should never be able to ride again.&#xD;
It came to me at last. Years after-&#xD;
ward I ripped up the saddle, and found&#xD;
the letter where I had never been able&#xD;
to reach it before. I knew it at once-&#xD;
by the green seal, and here it is, madam.&#xD;
I have brought it to show you that this&#xD;
&#xD;
is not all a dream I have been telling,&#xD;
but true as death. Read it some day,&#xD;
for her sake, and take care of it, for it is&#xD;
the only link left now of that long chain&#xD;
of correspondence. Perhaps you will&#xD;
recognize your relative's handwriting !"&#xD;
She looked at me sharply.&#xD;
I did, indeed, recognize the noble and&#xD;
peculiar character of one who once had&#xD;
been fatally dear to me; but I could not&#xD;
trust myself then to read that impassion-&#xD;
ed letter, confirming in every line the truth&#xD;
of Rena's past and subsequent asser-&#xD;
tions. Placing the letter%'in my pocket&#xD;
with as much coolness as I could com-&#xD;
mand, I begged her to continue her&#xD;
narrative; promising to read it at some&#xD;
future day, and make a just disposition&#xD;
of its contents. She seemed satisfied of&#xD;
my good intentions, and, after enjoining&#xD;
me to entire secresy, she proceeded, in&#xD;
her rambling and desultory mode, with&#xD;
her story of the "Green Seal," still far,&#xD;
it seemed, from its culmination.&#xD;
A month or more passed by in a&#xD;
kind of peaceable gloom, after my mas-&#xD;
ter's return.  My  mistress  and  he&#xD;
seldom met, except at meals. She could&#xD;
not bear to be thrown with him an in-&#xD;
stant alone, and shuddered if he even&#xD;
accidentally touched her-so darkly had&#xD;
her hatred for him gathered force-since&#xD;
his outrage to me and his insults to Mas-&#xD;
ter Richard.  That panther-look I have&#xD;
tried to describe to;you, was seldom oat&#xD;
of her eyes:now, when they fell on him,&#xD;
even when she saw him at a distance,&#xD;
and those burning spots rose to her&#xD;
cheek, whenever lie addressed me, that&#xD;
always showed anger or excitement, in&#xD;
her case. They came and went, like&#xD;
flame.&#xD;
" Did you bring her any more letters,&#xD;
Rena ?" I asked, nervously.&#xD;
"No, madam; Frederick Tanque went&#xD;
to M. Roquette by night for her letters,&#xD;
thenceforth. She wrote an order to this&#xD;
effect, and I think Mr. Claude pretty&#xD;
well understood, after my master's be-&#xD;
havior in his store, the necessity of con-&#xD;
cealment, believing always, as he did,&#xD;
that this was a mere literary corres-&#xD;
(pondence-to which every lady of taste&#xD;
|and education was entitled. It didl&#xD;
&#xD;
40        THE 11 ROMANCE OF THE GREEN SEAL."&#xD;
&#xD;
Frederick Tanque good to baffle his&#xD;
master, and to help my mistress in any&#xD;
way. He never stopped to ask ques-&#xD;
tions. Of course he thought she knew&#xD;
her own affairs best, and would do noth-&#xD;
ing to hurt herself.&#xD;
Those letters were her whole comfort&#xD;
now, and she would write sheet after&#xD;
sheet in reply, sometimes shedding tears&#xD;
above them, always pressing her lips&#xD;
upon them before she folded and sent&#xD;
them away. I noticed she always sealed&#xD;
them now-with the seal Master Rich-&#xD;
ard had given her, and once I heard her&#xD;
say:&#xD;
"Je verrais /-yes-I shall see, in-&#xD;
deed, when this wretched chain is broken&#xD;
and the 'hand' lifted from my eyes;&#xD;
but not as Richard meant-in heaven !&#xD;
Je verrais on earth, which is a still more&#xD;
agreeable prospect, I fancy."&#xD;
My master was truly very wretched&#xD;
about this time, and, perhaps, had my&#xD;
mistress known the whole truth, she&#xD;
might have softened toward him, as she&#xD;
had done before when he was in trouble.&#xD;
His losses were pressing heavily upon&#xD;
him; his creditors were losing patience,&#xD;
and hounding him at the law ; his com-&#xD;
mission merchants refused him further&#xD;
advances, and he knew not where to&#xD;
turn. He had quarreled with Master&#xD;
Richard, the only true friend he had,&#xD;
and was at dagger's points with Madame&#xD;
Zavier, his wife's mother; so that he had&#xD;
no one to advise with. Several times I&#xD;
thought he was on the point of making&#xD;
some communication to my mistress ;&#xD;
but she always waived him off with a&#xD;
sort of horror that had newly come to&#xD;
her eye and manner toward him. He felt&#xD;
this change, I am sure. He had never&#xD;
realized before how bitterly she could&#xD;
hate, or how insensible she could become.&#xD;
It was a desperate time to both.&#xD;
He sent for her, one day, by Julius, to&#xD;
meet him in the library for an hour's&#xD;
conversation, and she agreed to go if she&#xD;
might take me with her. No objection&#xD;
was made to this, and I sat at the door-&#xD;
S   step while they conversed, listening pain-&#xD;
fuly to every word they spoke, and filled&#xD;
with vague apprehensions of what might&#xD;
cometo  - pas&#xD;
&#xD;
He meant to be very calm, I think;&#xD;
but her manner irritated him from the&#xD;
first. There was such evident loathing,&#xD;
in every look ,and gesture, though she&#xD;
said but little, if any thing, to offend him&#xD;
until he had thrown off all disguise, and&#xD;
had shown his hideous nature without a&#xD;
mask.&#xD;
" I want you to write to Richard Za-&#xD;
vier, Aglae, and ask him to lend you five&#xD;
thousand dollars for three months. I&#xD;
will go your security for the repayment&#xD;
punctually, and when the money comes,&#xD;
you shall go to New Orleans with me,&#xD;
if you like."&#xD;
"I can not do this, M. Maurepas,"&#xD;
she answered, without hesitation. " I&#xD;
have no claims on that money or that&#xD;
gentleman after what has passed. I can&#xD;
not comprehend your conduct, I confess.&#xD;
It is inscrutable to me."&#xD;
"Are you quite sure, Agilae, that you&#xD;
have no right to this money'?" he hissed&#xD;
in her ear. " When a woman makes&#xD;
such sacrifices for a man as you have&#xD;
made for your Cousin Richard, she  has&#xD;
certain claims-acknowledged in morals&#xD;
if not in law."&#xD;
" There is one thing I am quite sure&#xD;
of," she said, as cold as ice, drawing&#xD;
away from him as' she spoke. "TThat&#xD;
you have none, whatever mine may be.&#xD;
More, M. Maur pas, I know that you do&#xD;
not believe one syllable of your own base&#xD;
insinuations. You mean to torture me&#xD;
because you can, that is all. But, thank&#xD;
God, you have lost all power to move&#xD;
me by any words of, yours. I, that was&#xD;
wax once, in your cmiuel hands, am hard-&#xD;
ened into stone."&#xD;
He looked at her with a cold, incred-&#xD;
ulous sneer; then, sitting down to the&#xD;
table, wrote a few lines which he handed&#xD;
to her, with a pen filled with ink.&#xD;
"Sign that paper, Aglae," h'e said,&#xD;
calmly. " Here, lay it on this book," hand-&#xD;
ing her one, " a name is soon writteu."&#xD;
" Not so soon expunged," she replied,&#xD;
after glancing over the paper. Then&#xD;
pushing ~it away, she added: " I am at&#xD;
a loss to understand, M. Maurepas,.hos'&#xD;
you can expect me to codperate with you&#xD;
in asking this or any other favor of&#xD;
Richard Zavier."&#xD;

&#xD;
" My magnanimity is surprising, even&#xD;
to myself," he said, shrugging his shoul-&#xD;
ders, and standing before her ; " but,&#xD;
the truth is, I am inclined to make al-&#xD;
lowances for circumstances, and my ne-&#xD;
cessities are urgent-temporary embar-&#xD;
rassments only, however. Come, make&#xD;
no further objections. Sign this like a&#xD;
good girl, and let us be friends again."&#xD;
She dashed down the pen. " Never,"&#xD;
she cried. "I will never sign such a re-&#xD;
quest, promptly as I know it would be&#xD;
complied with; nor should you ask me&#xD;
such a thing, after the-contumely you have&#xD;
heaped on my noble, unoffending kinsman.&#xD;
Where is your pride, M. Mtturepas ?"&#xD;
" In the dust, where you have laid it,&#xD;
madam," he sneered, bowing low.&#xD;
" You speak falsely, sir, and you know&#xD;
it. As far as you can know, I have&#xD;
never humiliated you or myself. What I&#xD;
may do remains to be seen, M. Maurepas."&#xD;
" Do you threaten me, madam?   Do&#xD;
you dare to gnaw your chain ? Girl,&#xD;
you overstep your limits. Thank heaven,&#xD;
your opportunities are small, and they&#xD;
shall be still less in future. But, what&#xD;
is the use of trying to reason? There,&#xD;
take your seat at the table ; write a let-&#xD;
ter to Richard Zavier with my approval.&#xD;
Ask him to come back to Maurepas, if&#xD;
you like; have it your own way ; work&#xD;
it as you will. Pave the way for recon-&#xD;
ciliation, and, when I get him here, I&#xD;
can obtain the. loan without your im-&#xD;
portant cooperation."&#xD;
" I will not write him for such a pur-&#xD;
pose," she replied sternly ; "nor, on con-&#xD;
sideration, have I any reason to suppose&#xD;
that, after your unjust treatment, he&#xD;
would receive a letter directed to him in&#xD;
my handwriting; or, if received, on my&#xD;
own account, reply to it at all. I shall&#xD;
never ask him to return, M. Maur pas."&#xD;
Then, with a wail I can never forget,&#xD;
she cried out: "I have lost my Cousin&#xD;
Richard 1"                       ,&#xD;
She clasped her hands in a mute, ag-&#xD;
onized way, and bowed her face over&#xD;
them. She had never fully realized this&#xD;
loss before (she told me this afterward),&#xD;
nor what a blank it would leave in her&#xD;
existence. ,&#xD;
" And is he so dear to you," my mas-&#xD;
&#xD;
ter muttered, between his clinched teeth,&#xD;
"that the want 9f Iim should make&#xD;
you as bitter as gallto every one else?&#xD;
What is this man to you-speak, Aglae&#xD;
Maurepas-that you dare to lament him&#xD;
thus in your husband's very presence ?"&#xD;
She raised her head ; she looked him&#xD;
clear in the face ; the panther look was&#xD;
gone, and her words were grave and low.&#xD;
"My moral sunshine," she made an-&#xD;
swer.  I recollect how beautiful her&#xD;
words, her face, seemed to me at that&#xD;
moment; but my master was a savage.&#xD;
Some gust of sudden rage seemed t(&#xD;
sweep him from his feet. He forgot&#xD;
every thing but the fury that possessed&#xD;
him-forgot that he was a husband, a&#xD;
gentleman, a man !&#xD;
Raising his hand, and grinding his&#xD;
teeth with a fierce oath, he struck her&#xD;
twice ; once on the cheek, once on the&#xD;
neck, just above her left breast, and his&#xD;
hand was raised for a third blow when&#xD;
I rushed shrieking between them.&#xD;
He stood, then, dumb, confounded,&#xD;
with his arms hanging down, his head&#xD;
bent low on his bosom, his face distort-&#xD;
ed, his eyes upturned, fixed upon her&#xD;
face, that, pale, and still, and cold, smil-&#xD;
ed bitterly straight before him. Madam,&#xD;
it was awful to see her then-so still had&#xD;
the shock made her, so strangely had it&#xD;
affected her. Smiling, she put me away&#xD;
and passed from the apartment-smiling,&#xD;
with her great growing eyes fixed upon&#xD;
space, and waving her hands slowly as&#xD;
she walked through the porches and&#xD;
corridor, as a blind person might, who&#xD;
walks in strange places, to put away&#xD;
all obstacles.  And so, still smiling,&#xD;
she came to her own chamber again,&#xD;
while I clung in agony to her gar-&#xD;
ments. But, again she put me away,&#xD;
and I thought the storm was coming ;&#xD;
but not so. No tears, no weakness&#xD;
then, only a long, fixed stare in the glass&#xD;
at the red marks on her cheek and&#xD;
bosom, so soon to become purple bruises.&#xD;
Another long look at the little dagger&#xD;
she took from the drawer of the toilet&#xD;
table-it was well she had not worn it&#xD;
that day-and a lingering touch of the&#xD;
small, white fingers, as though to test its&#xD;
metal well and thoroughly. Then again,&#xD;
&#xD;
that slow, fixed, terrible smile, as she&#xD;
turned-the weapon over and over admir-&#xD;
ingly, passing it now close to her eyes,&#xD;
as a child does a prism, then holding it&#xD;
away at arm's-length again, as one does a&#xD;
beautiful jewel, to admire. Oh ! God,&#xD;
was she going mad, or, did she meditate&#xD;
murder    These thoughts swept through&#xD;
me and nerved me ,to break the spell.&#xD;
I gave way to a passion of grief, and,&#xD;
falling at her feet, I cried out piteously:&#xD;
"Oh, mistress, mistress ! for sweet&#xD;
Jesus' sake, don't kill my poor, wicked&#xD;
master !"&#xD;
She spoke with strange clearness, in&#xD;
a voice whose sound was exultant, even&#xD;
to my ear, and not husky and broken as&#xD;
I had expected to hear it.&#xD;
"-Child, child, I would not hurt one&#xD;
hair of his head," she said, "to be queen&#xD;
of all this world !"&#xD;
"It is yourself, then, dear mistress, you&#xD;
mean to harm. I know it is your own&#xD;
sweet life that you are going to destroy ;&#xD;
and, oh ! my mistress, think of dear&#xD;
Master Richard and all his teachings,&#xD;
and his great grief, and mine and Madame&#xD;
Zavier's, when we feel that heaven is&#xD;
closed forever against you, a suicide. Tell&#xD;
me, dear mistress, are you going to die ?"&#xD;
I looked up in her face with streaming&#xD;
eyes, and she bent tenderly above me.&#xD;
The dreadful smile was gone now, ,nd a&#xD;
sweet seriousness had replaced it. Tears,&#xD;
too, were on her cheek-tears of relief.&#xD;
"No, Rena, no !" she replied, "I am&#xD;
not going to die. I am only going to be-&#xD;
gin to live ! My chains are broken now,&#xD;
and I am free, as you, too, shall be, dear&#xD;
child, after a season.  Your Master&#xD;
Richard shall not be troubled by any&#xD;
rash act of mine, if I can help it, for we&#xD;
must be secret as the grave ; you and I,&#xD;
Rena," whispering clearly, " we will fly&#xD;
together. The way is plain before us, and&#xD;
I shall live my new life." Adding, with&#xD;
her finger on her lip, " I am going to him!"&#xD;
P A RT IV.&#xD;
MY Scheherezade was interrupted, on&#xD;
this occasion, by the unexpected entrance&#xD;
&#xD;
of my husband, who had returned earlier&#xD;
in the evening than usual from his place&#xD;
of business. He had already been back&#xD;
some days from  Cuba, but had never&#xD;
chanced to confront my quadroon laun-&#xD;
dress. She eyed .him vigilantly, I saw,&#xD;
drawing comparisons evidently between&#xD;
his face and its "counterfeit present-&#xD;
ment" on the walls, as her dark eyes flash-&#xD;
ed from one to the other, and apparently&#xD;
well satisfied with the result of this scru-&#xD;
tiny, rested at last, dreamily, on the floor.&#xD;
When he had gone out again she took&#xD;
up the thread of her story-which had&#xD;
probably made the theme of her musings&#xD;
-without an intervening remark, and&#xD;
with a sort of careless abruptness that&#xD;
might have beseemed royalty:&#xD;
Of course you know, madam, who&#xD;
she meant by 'him.' Young as I was,&#xD;
and simple, I understood at once, and a&#xD;
sort of terror took possession of me,&#xD;
when I thought of that smiling, cruel,&#xD;
face (no blood relation of yours, I am&#xD;
glad to hear, lady), and what would be&#xD;
our fate if=we fell into such hands ? But&#xD;
I said nothing, and weeks passed before&#xD;
my mistress made mention of her purpose&#xD;
again. By this time she had received&#xD;
another letter, sealed with the " Green&#xD;
Seal," and I heard her talking to it and over&#xD;
it, as she always did when those morsels of&#xD;
witchcraft came; and in this way I knew&#xD;
what her plan was, and that she was going&#xD;
to meet Mr. Adrian, who had been long,&#xD;
as I knew before, entreating her to come&#xD;
to him as soon as she had an opportunity.&#xD;
"We are to go to Boston, Rena," she said,&#xD;
" where I can make my livelihood with&#xD;
my pen and be independent of every body,&#xD;
and Mr. Adrian insures me employment,&#xD;
for he has great influence with the jour-&#xD;
nals, some of which have already publish-&#xD;
ed my pieces, though without paying me,&#xD;
so far; and we are to live with hi's sister&#xD;
-you and I-until the time comes to&#xD;
break my chains, not a hard thing to do in&#xD;
that free country where there are no slaves&#xD;
-no weary women, as I am told, bound in&#xD;
relentless marriage yokes, as in this lovely&#xD;
land where nature rebukes humanity."&#xD;
Then she sat awhile with her small white&#xD;
hands clasped, and her eyes cast up in that&#xD;
pretty way she had, which always made&#xD;

&#xD;
me feel as if she were praying, though I&#xD;
do not know that she was ; and present-&#xD;
ly she broke out again, very suddenly:&#xD;
"I shall burn my bridges as I go,&#xD;
Rena, like a great General of old times,&#xD;
and leave no vestige behind by which I&#xD;
can be traced, even by your Master&#xD;
Richard. They can imagine me dead,&#xD;
if the worst cones-mother and, all the.&#xD;
rest-and you know how easily people&#xD;
forget their dead I What is inevitable is&#xD;
always borne with courage. It is, indeed,&#xD;
a beautiful order that it should be so !&#xD;
M. Maurepas will get him another wife,&#xD;
who will bear him the children he craves,&#xD;
and when two years have come and gone&#xD;
I shall be happy with a noble husband.&#xD;
Yes, Adrian," she murmured, "1I will re-&#xD;
pose evermore on your honor and fidelity."&#xD;
"May I tell my mother, mistress," I&#xD;
ventured to ask, "of this plan of yours ?&#xD;
She would never betray you, I am sure,&#xD;
nor would Frederick Tanque."&#xD;
"No, child, not for worlds," adding,&#xD;
carelessly, "but you need not go with me&#xD;
unless you choose, Rena."&#xD;
I answered only by humbly kissing her&#xD;
hand ; but, even then, I was meditating&#xD;
perfidy!i Oh, madam, from love, not&#xD;
hate, I was about to play the part of Judas&#xD;
Iscariot, and give her up into the hands&#xD;
of her friends, not her enemies-yet all&#xD;
the same I was to step in between her&#xD;
and happiness forever."&#xD;
The quadroon sat with her hands&#xD;
locked and her head bowed over them,&#xD;
in a penitential attitude, evidently lost in&#xD;
thought, when I roused her with a ques-&#xD;
tion:&#xD;
"And where was M. Maurepas all&#xD;
this time, Rena ? Was there no effort&#xD;
on his part at-reconciliation with his&#xD;
justly offended wife ?"&#xD;
"At home, madam--at home, walking&#xD;
the house like a caged panther day and&#xD;
night, sorry enough, no doubt, for what&#xD;
he had done, but never daring to come&#xD;
near my mistress, who commonly kept&#xD;
bolt and bar between them. Some-&#xD;
times she would throw open her windows&#xD;
and sit by them, however, and at ,such&#xD;
times he was always 'sure to pass5 on the&#xD;
galleries, but there was a look in her&#xD;
eyes like frozen fire that was hard to&#xD;
&#xD;
meet and that frightened even him, and&#xD;
lie left her to herself. That look cowed&#xD;
him and made him quiet, so that even I&#xD;
began to pity him in my heart, fbr the gift&#xD;
is not given to every one to hate any&#xD;
more than to love as my mistress could.&#xD;
But she only laughed coldly whei I&#xD;
spoke of his trouble, and turned away,,&#xD;
saying, very bitterly, I thought, in clear,&#xD;
calm tones:&#xD;
" May his trouble never be less, Rena,&#xD;
but I will not wish it more for my own&#xD;
sake."&#xD;
"Mistress," I could not help exclaim-&#xD;
ing, "does not Jesus Christ tell us to&#xD;
forgive ?"&#xD;
"How can we forgive when we are&#xD;
not angry ?" she asked in turn. " M.&#xD;
Maurepas is simply dead to me, and I&#xD;
should be as divine as our Savior himself&#xD;
could I bid the dead live again. Did you&#xD;
ever try to kindle a fire with ashes,&#xD;
Rena ?"&#xD;
I hung my head ; I understood her&#xD;
then. All was over between them, and&#xD;
forever; yet he was her husband, and I&#xD;
had heard Master Richard say what a&#xD;
solemn bond marriage was-one never&#xD;
to be broken in our holy church-" a tie&#xD;
as long as life and as strong as death," lie&#xD;
called it.&#xD;
It was to Master Richard I betrayed&#xD;
her.&#xD;
I had been taught to write legibly&#xD;
by my mistress, though with great diffi-&#xD;
culty. Somehow ITnever took to writing&#xD;
as I did to other things, and my hand&#xD;
would cramp terribly in copying out long&#xD;
words, and though I could spell very well&#xD;
off the book, when I tried to write down&#xD;
my thoughts all the letters would get&#xD;
jumbled together ih my mind and the&#xD;
words would look strange to me on paper.&#xD;
The hardest work- I have ever under-&#xD;
taken in my life was writing that long&#xD;
letter to Master Richard. I was a week&#xD;
about it, for I had to choose my time&#xD;
when my mistress was busy with her&#xD;
papers, or sitting like one in a dream,&#xD;
forgetful of all about her. Bdt I did not&#xD;
fold up or seal my letter until I had&#xD;
heard her say when she was going to&#xD;
leave Maurepas, and where Mr. Adrian&#xD;
was to meet her. He was to be at&#xD;

Memphis, on the first of December,&#xD;
she said, (after getting another letter from&#xD;
him) and would wait for her there until&#xD;
she found an opportunity to leave home&#xD;
during my master's absence.&#xD;
We knew he would be obliged to go&#xD;
to New Orleans, early in that month, but&#xD;
he never told any one what day he meant&#xD;
to go or to return. So we were all&#xD;
packed, waiting many days. And now,&#xD;
let me tell you, madam, my mistress put&#xD;
aside all books and jewels and fine dresses&#xD;
he had given her, and locked them in&#xD;
the Armorie, leaving the key with my&#xD;
mother and placing in her trunks only a&#xD;
few plain clothes and the remains of her&#xD;
marriage trousseau, her diamonds, her&#xD;
Cashmere shawl-gifts from her dead&#xD;
father ; also the bag of gold pieces Ma-&#xD;
dame Zavier had given her for private ex-&#xD;
penses on her wedding morning, not one&#xD;
of which she had ever touched, for my&#xD;
master was liberal enough as far as&#xD;
money went, and liked to see her dress&#xD;
fine and spend freely when they went to&#xD;
the cities together. It pleased him well&#xD;
to see all the lorgnettes pointed at her at&#xD;
the opera house at New Orleans, though&#xD;
he would tantalize her about it afterward.&#xD;
He never loved her better, I believe,&#xD;
than when she treated him with such&#xD;
cold scorn. After his late bad behavior&#xD;
I am sure he could have crawled to her&#xD;
feet during those last weeks at Maurepas,&#xD;
but for the fear he had of her fiery, flash-&#xD;
ing eyes, and that look of frozen flame&#xD;
(madam, I can give it no better name),&#xD;
she turned upon him, whenever he cross-&#xD;
ed her presence.&#xD;
" He is no more to me," I heard her&#xD;
murmur one day as he went by her win-&#xD;
dow like a shadow, "than the scorpion&#xD;
that crawls on the wall; but I will not let&#xD;
him sting me if I can help it ! Yet, I&#xD;
would harm no creature willingly."&#xD;
Mr. Grimshaw, his commission mer-&#xD;
chant from New Orleans, arrived about&#xD;
this time and stayed a week at Maure-&#xD;
pas, walking about every where with my&#xD;
master, examining the sugar-houses and&#xD;
the engine carefully, and jotting down&#xD;
notes of every thing in his memoran-&#xD;
dum-book, and getting a list of the ne-&#xD;
groes, with every name written out in&#xD;
&#xD;
full, from the oldest down to the young-&#xD;
est. But this my mistress never knew,&#xD;
and Frederick Tanque bade me keep it&#xD;
from her.&#xD;
On the eighth or tenth of December&#xD;
my master went to New Orleans with&#xD;
Mr. Grimshaw, and from that moment&#xD;
my mistress was on the watch for, a&#xD;
steamboat to take her away in an oppo-,&#xD;
site direction, for, as I have said, she&#xD;
had been ready to go for many days&#xD;
past. Once in every four or five hours&#xD;
she sent to Mr. Roquette to know when&#xD;
the next packet would touch at Claire-&#xD;
forte, and the morning after my master&#xD;
left home the young man wrote to me&#xD;
that the propeller Palestine was expect-&#xD;
ed between sundown and dark, that eve-&#xD;
ning.   Then our arrangements were&#xD;
made at once to go in the Palestine.&#xD;
The barouche was ordered and Julius&#xD;
drove us over, while Frederick Tanque&#xD;
followed in the spring-wagon with our&#xD;
light baggage. The servants thought we&#xD;
were going to visit Madame Zavier, at her&#xD;
place, Les Boccages, between Natchez&#xD;
and Vicksburg, for a few days, and, as it&#xD;
turned out, they were not far from right,&#xD;
but of our real intention they had no idea.&#xD;
Once only my mistress came near be-&#xD;
traying herself, and that was in parting&#xD;
with Mr. Roquette, who was all atten-&#xD;
tion, and insisted upon putting on board&#xD;
a basket of his famous sweet oranges&#xD;
from trees Master Richard had grafted&#xD;
in his little garden, and gave my mis-&#xD;
tress his arm to lead her safely to the&#xD;
cabin, for it was quite dark when the&#xD;
steamer Palestine came sparkling along.&#xD;
" Good-by, Mr. Roquette," I heard her&#xD;
say. "May all prosperity be yours, and if&#xD;
ever you see my cousin Richard again, tell&#xD;
him-but no ! I will send no messages I"&#xD;
and she checked herself suddenly..&#xD;
"I see how it is, Madame Maur pas,"&#xD;
said Mr. Roquette, in a low, tearful&#xD;
voice ; " you are never coming back&#xD;
again," adding, after a pause: ".May God&#xD;
bless you, madam, wherever you are."&#xD;
She laughed with a real ring in her&#xD;
voice that surprised me, for I was ready&#xD;
to burst out crying all the time, and&#xD;
trembling like a leaf.&#xD;
" How tragical we all are to-night,&#xD;

&#xD;
Mr. Roquette ! But, I suppose it is be-&#xD;
cause I go so seldom from home that&#xD;
such solemn partings occur!  I can't tell&#xD;
what has become of my cheerfulness.&#xD;
Farewell," giving hin her hand; "and le&#xD;
sure to be the first to welcome me when&#xD;
I come home;" and she turned joyfully&#xD;
from  Mr. Roquette, who left us, no&#xD;
doubt, perfectly convinced of her sin-&#xD;
cerity.&#xD;
That was the first time I had ever&#xD;
accused my mistress secretly of being&#xD;
deceitful.&#xD;
But, just as if this gayety had been a&#xD;
mantle she had worn for a time and un-&#xD;
clasped at the throat and let fall to the&#xD;
floor when she was tired of it, did her&#xD;
behavior change when she found herself&#xD;
alone with me in her state-room.  A&#xD;
countenance of deeper woe I never saw&#xD;
than was hers, as she sat leaning back&#xD;
against the wall, with her eyes closed&#xD;
and her face half turned aside, and her&#xD;
locked hands lying loosely on her lap.&#xD;
She refused to go out to the supper-&#xD;
table, but I went to the steward and&#xD;
brought her a cup of tea and a cracker,&#xD;
and she ate'it mechanically, just as a&#xD;
child takes its food from a nurse's hand,&#xD;
but seemed little better afterward-ly-&#xD;
ing in her berth and meaning low all&#xD;
night, in a piteous way that kept sleep&#xD;
from may eyes.&#xD;
At five o'clock in the morning we blew&#xD;
off steam at Natchez where we were to&#xD;
lie-to an hour-and, on hearing this, I&#xD;
got off and went to the, guard to see&#xD;
the city as well as I could below the hill,&#xD;
and watch the drays come down the&#xD;
bluffs piled with cotton, and the deck&#xD;
hands going and coming by the light of&#xD;
blazing torches-for the fog hung heavy&#xD;
over every thing, and it was a dark and&#xD;
dreary dawn, cheerless as midnight.&#xD;
A'carriage drove up, almost below the&#xD;
guard over which I was hanging, and&#xD;
unable to go further on account of the&#xD;
cotton-bales, stopped at some distance(&#xD;
from the plank. I saw a gentleman ge&#xD;
out slowly, wearing his arm in a sling&#xD;
Just at that moment a passing torec&#xD;
flashed on his face, and I knew my ma~&#xD;
ter Richard. He looked very white i&#xD;
that strong yellow light, and walke&#xD;

I&#xD;

--&#xD;
&#xD;
feebly, I thought, leaning as was not his&#xD;
habit on a cane. My heart beat wildly&#xD;
as I saw him come on board, to make&#xD;
inquiries of us I knew, but I said nothing&#xD;
about his presence to my mistress when&#xD;
I went back to her state-room. She was&#xD;
already awake, however, if indeed she&#xD;
had slept at all during that uneasy night,&#xD;
and spoke to me as I entered.&#xD;
"I must get up and dress myself&#xD;
soon," she said. " I want to see ' Les&#xD;
Boccages' once more as we pass by, and&#xD;
I am not certain how many hours' run&#xD;
it is from Natchez. I took 'no note of&#xD;
time' when I went there three years&#xD;
ago. Every thing was so different then."&#xD;
" Yes, my dear mistress," I thought to&#xD;
myself, " that dreadful serpent-seal had&#xD;
not then twisted itself about your heart.&#xD;
You were as free then, for all your home-&#xD;
troubles, as a bird on a bush."  But I&#xD;
said nothing, and went to work at once&#xD;
to assist her to dress, taking down her&#xD;
long, black hair, which reached to her&#xD;
knees, and combing it carefully, though&#xD;
with trembling hands, then arranging it&#xD;
in the French twist and coils she always&#xD;
wore, and which so well became her&#xD;
small and graceful head. Then she&#xD;
threw on her black silk gown and&#xD;
crimson shawl, and with a lace vail over&#xD;
her head, went out on the guard to watch&#xD;
for "Les Boccages."  I had taken her a&#xD;
cup of coffee, all she would taste. I&#xD;
never saw her cheeks .so pale, nor her&#xD;
eye so bright, as on that gray, dreary&#xD;
morning, nor her mouth of such a burn-&#xD;
ing red. She looked just like a beauti-&#xD;
ful vision, madam, I once saw painted&#xD;
- of a transfigured saint.&#xD;
About an hour later I heard her utter&#xD;
a faint cry, and, looking out from the&#xD;
state-room door, I saw Master Richard&#xD;
standing beside her.&#xD;
e " We are bound to the same point, I&#xD;
, suppose, Aglie," I heard him say. "I&#xD;
e am afraid you, too, have had bad news&#xD;
e from ' Les Boccages.'"&#xD;
t    She did not answer, but looked at him&#xD;
.in strange, confused silence, liftig her&#xD;
[h hand to her head, gasping as if over-&#xD;

&#xD;
with his head on my pillow that I did&#xD;
not love? Why should men and women&#xD;
be tied together like leashed hounds,&#xD;
making each other wicked and woeful,&#xD;
when each one could be happy, free and&#xD;
independent with a mate of his or her&#xD;
own choosing?' I asked myself these&#xD;
questions many and many a miserable&#xD;
day, when it was too late to ask them,&#xD;
and I came to think that thesin against&#xD;
the' Holy Ghost is to divide true love-&#xD;
the unpardonable sin, madam."&#xD;
I saw how unprofitable, and even un-&#xD;
dignified on my part, a discussion on&#xD;
this subject would be between Rena and&#xD;
myself-one on which she was evidently&#xD;
warped against her finer instincts; and&#xD;
I sought to bring her back to her clue&#xD;
of story by hazarding one remark-a&#xD;
personal one, very painful to me.&#xD;
" But, Rena, you have already said Mr.&#xD;
Adrian had a cruel face! How could you&#xD;
think he could, in any way, have contrib-&#xD;
uted to the happiness of your mistressfl"&#xD;
" Oh, madam, perhaps it was the false&#xD;
life he led with the wife he never loved&#xD;
that gave him this look and shook his&#xD;
principles. With my sweet mistress,&#xD;
who seemed to be his fate as ie was&#xD;
surely hers, all might have been entirely&#xD;
different."&#xD;
" Yes, yes," I rejoined, hastily.  I&#xD;
see what you mean ; but I fancy you&#xD;
are mistaken."  I would have said:aI,&#xD;
too, knew this man - cold, brilliant&#xD;
fsacinating; and understand what h&#xD;
might have been to such a woman al&#xD;
Aglale Maur pas," but I was silent with&#xD;
a stab in my heart, that, in ts very&#xD;
poignancy of, pain, taught me to yearn&#xD;
over one I had so long condemned an&#xD;
censured, too stringently by half.&#xD;
Already was the self-appointed court&#xD;
melting before the pleadings of this hum&#xD;
ble Portia, and the dread demandthef&#xD;
had once been urged by the plaintiff fo&#xD;
" a pound of flesh," cut from the quiver&#xD;
ing heart of a rival, was repudiated no&#xD;
Pity, mercy, forgiveness, were all a&#xD;
work in the breast of one lng nenu&#xD;
ble to either, as far as fiit ntr&#xD;
could feel or offer them. The words 0&#xD;
the quadroon had found their way&#xD;
conviction; and the truth of her asse&#xD;
&#xD;
tion-" the wife he never loved, and&#xD;
who never suited him "-conjured up a&#xD;
vision of what might have been had the&#xD;
wife of " Adrian " been "Valerie," the&#xD;
being of fire and air with her Cleopatra-&#xD;
like variety, her resilient nature.&#xD;
" Yes, this was the woman," I thought,&#xD;
"who alone- could have chained his&#xD;
fickle fancy and captivated his fastidious&#xD;
eye and taste-perhaps even reached a&#xD;
heart, undiscovered by another ! She&#xD;
might have supplied the wants of his&#xD;
whole nature, and developed the God&#xD;
that was in him-the slumbering deity."&#xD;
But, it was no time for reflections&#xD;
like these. I sought to untangle a skein&#xD;
and seize a clue to a story too long a&#xD;
matter of mystery to me,. whose right to&#xD;
such knowledge was unimpeachable.&#xD;
Digression and reverie were alike out of,&#xD;
place under such circumstances.&#xD;
" My mistress never uncovered her face&#xD;
again," continued Rena, until master&#xD;
Richard touched her arm to point out&#xD;
" Les Boccages," her mother's place,&#xD;
that we were now approaching in the&#xD;
bend of the river. The white cottage-&#xD;
house, covered with multiflora vines,&#xD;
was not more than a hundred yards&#xD;
distant from the wood-landing, and like&#xD;
a person walking in sleep, my mistress&#xD;
suffered herself to be led oi shore.&#xD;
We saw no one on the portico, and&#xD;
when we had entered the house, all was&#xD;
silent.  Then  Aunt Polly, Madame&#xD;
Zavier's housekeeper, came out to re-&#xD;
ceive us, and we were shown into the&#xD;
library, while, at some signal from&#xD;
r master Richard, she disappeared before&#xD;
my mistress had time to question her,&#xD;
and we were left alone, thinking she had&#xD;
gone to apprise Madame Zavier.&#xD;
t    "Now, cousin Richard," said my mis.&#xD;
- tress, firmly, " you must tell me, before&#xD;
t  I go to 'my mother's room, which of my&#xD;
r, brothers is injured, and bow so, that I&#xD;
may be prepared for the worst."&#xD;
" Your mother is not at home, cousin&#xD;
it Aglie," said my master Richard, calm-&#xD;
.  ly. ",She went yesterday to Natchez,&#xD;
where Francis is confined to his bed,&#xD;
f (his wife had written to your mother&#xD;
0to this effect,) with a fractured limb.&#xD;
r- Not ill, however, by any means, for I&#xD;
&#xD;
have just seen him. Bernard an&#xD;
Jacques are with her, and Eugene, yo&#xD;
know, is at Oakland Uuniversity, so tht&#xD;
we find ourselves here alone, and I at&#xD;
glad of it, for I have a strange reveal&#xD;
tion to make to you."&#xD;
She glanced at his wounded arm, an&#xD;
the blood forsook her cheek. She had no&#xD;
before perceived it in her bewilderment&#xD;
'You have had a difficulty with mi&#xD;
husband-you have killed M. Maurepas,&#xD;
she cried, clasping her hands wildly&#xD;
Oh, Richard, was it for me ?  I trus&#xD;
'+     not-I trust not1"&#xD;
"I have not seen M. Maurepas since&#xD;
we parted in your presence," he mad(&#xD;
answer. " My difficulty has been a very&#xD;
S}ty  diffierent one," hesitating long before h&#xD;
added : " I have just been to Memphis.'&#xD;
As he spoke he eyed her sternly.&#xD;
She uttered a long, low shriek, and&#xD;
covered her face with her hands, then&#xD;
looked up again suddenly, pale, tearless,&#xD;
and with flashing eyes.&#xD;
"What business had you there ?" she&#xD;
asked, confronting him proudly with a&#xD;
_ r    bitter smile. "May I take the liberty&#xD;
of inquiring, Richard Zavier ?"&#xD;
" I went there to anticipate your meet-&#xD;
ing with. Mr. Adrian," he answered. "As&#xD;
the oldest male representative of your&#xD;
blood I went thither to prevent a stain&#xD;
on your hitherto spotless honor." '&#xD;
" And you kiled him!"   "&#xD;
Her head dropped on her bosom, her&#xD;
hands on her knees as she spoke, like&#xD;
one utterly hopeless.&#xD;
No, Aglae," said my Master Richard,&#xD;
calmly. "I only tried to kill him. The&#xD;
villain escaped with his accursed-life."&#xD;
" This from you, Richard Zavier ?"&#xD;
'fThis from me, Aglfie Maurepas."&#xD;
You have brought me here on a&#xD;
fool's errand," she exclaimed, passion-&#xD;
ately, "but you shall not mar nay in-&#xD;
tention. I will yet join Mr. Adrian !"&#xD;
"Never, my cousin, never 1" shaking&#xD;
his head.&#xD;
Prevent me at your peril, sir !" and&#xD;
she rose before him, and flashed upon him&#xD;
a lo that seemed to wither him as he&#xD;
stood. He staggered feebly to a chair,&#xD;
fell back in it, and closed his eyes like one&#xD;
about to faint. His wound was bleed-&#xD;
&#xD;
d  ing afresh, but we did'-not know it then.&#xD;
u " I shall proceed to Memphis on the&#xD;
at first packet that woods at Les Boccages,"&#xD;
m   said my mistress, firmly. "In the mean&#xD;
a- time acquaint me, if you please, what&#xD;
you mean by interfering in my literary&#xD;
d engagements, and how you received in-&#xD;
)t formation of my movements?   I insist&#xD;
t. upon an answer to these questions. I&#xD;
y hold you to account, Richard Zavier I"&#xD;
"    Standing behind my mistress, I uttered&#xD;
. an exclamation that made Master Richard&#xD;
t look up. He caught my eye, and the&#xD;
expression I read in his, prevented my&#xD;
e revelation. It froze me into silence again.&#xD;
e    " A letter, addressed to me, in a clerkly&#xD;
y superscription" (the truth was, I had&#xD;
e requested one of M. Roquette's clerks to&#xD;
direct it for me, the day I mailed it my-&#xD;
self,) " reached me in time to permit me&#xD;
to reach Memphis before the fatal first&#xD;
of December," said my Master Richard,&#xD;
faintly, " and in accordance with what&#xD;
I deemed my duty, I waited there the&#xD;
arrival of Mr. Adrian--for such was&#xD;
his assumed name. His real one you&#xD;
shall never know from me, Aglae. Suf-&#xD;
fice it to say, we settled our affairs&#xD;
with pistols on the third, and were both&#xD;
slightly wounded. He has gone home&#xD;
to his wife and family, a wiser and&#xD;
better man, I trust-having learned that&#xD;
Southern -women are held too sacred&#xD;
with their kindred to be tampered with,&#xD;
by prying Yankee scoundrels. He has&#xD;
gone home, Aglte, cured . of his folly,&#xD;
believe me ; but not until he had signed&#xD;
this paper."&#xD;
He rose with a great effort and drew&#xD;
from his pocket a folded document, and,&#xD;
staggering feebly to the door, threw it&#xD;
at her feet as he passed her. A. moment&#xD;
later, just after I had picked up the&#xD;
paper and handed it to my mistress who&#xD;
clutched it eagerly, I heard a fall in the&#xD;
corridor,~and Aunt Polly and I reached&#xD;
Master Richard at the same nioment.&#xD;
He was lying covered with blood and&#xD;
quite insensible on - the floor. For-&#xD;
tunately the neighboring physician lived&#xD;
hard by, and he came very promptly&#xD;
and bound Master Richard's arm, And&#xD;
administered reviving remedies, and he&#xD;
was soon made comfortable, though so&#xD;

50        THE " ROMANCE OF THE GREEN SEAL."&#xD;
&#xD;
weak that he did not leave his bed for&#xD;
many days.             -&#xD;
During all this time my mistress&#xD;
never went near him, nor, indeed, when&#xD;
I returned to ,tell her of Master Rich-&#xD;
ard's condition, did she pay any attention&#xD;
to what I said, sitting as she was like a&#xD;
stone and, wholly taken up with that&#xD;
fatal paper which contained Mr. Adrian's1&#xD;
sworn renunciation, and which she read"&#xD;
over and over with moving lips and&#xD;
straining eyes until I feared it would&#xD;
madden her. So, after every thing was&#xD;
done for Master Richard that we could&#xD;
do, Aunt Polly and I led my mistressI&#xD;
to her own chamber, the beautiful blue&#xD;
room which Madame Zavier kept for&#xD;
guests, and placed her on the sofa drawn&#xD;
up before the fire, with shawls and pil-&#xD;
lows around her, while, all the time, she&#xD;
looked like a-frozen creature, and felt like&#xD;
one, chilly as ice as she was, lying like&#xD;
a person in a dreadful dream, which is&#xD;
only half believed to be real. Oh, mad-&#xD;
am, that was a trying time indeed !&#xD;
Aunt Polly would have brought in&#xD;
the doctor who came to see Master&#xD;
Richard, but I would not let her, know-&#xD;
ing my mistress as I did, and feeling&#xD;
sure that she would revive best if left to&#xD;
herself and me. The other servants&#xD;
- were all carefully excluded. The paper&#xD;
Master Richard had given her she had&#xD;
hidden by this time in her bosom, and&#xD;
while she lived no human eye except&#xD;
her own ever rested on it again.&#xD;
What did it contain, Rena ?"&#xD;
" I have it here madam, if you would&#xD;
like to see it. I brought it purpo ly ;"&#xD;
and she drew from her worn pocket-&#xD;
book a paper yellowed by time, with a&#xD;
signature affixed in a well-known hand.&#xD;
" It was a solemn oath, as you will see,"&#xD;
she pursued, " on the part of the signer,&#xD;
Master Richard said, never again to see&#xD;
or to hold correspondence with "Valerie,"&#xD;
or the person he knew as such ; an oath&#xD;
that had been compelled from him by&#xD;
my Master Richard, who never told him&#xD;
the name of my mistress. .,&#xD;
Years afterward Deemah told me this,&#xD;
but I suspected it at the time, and so did&#xD;
she, my mistress I mean; and madam,&#xD;
was it not strange ? She forgave him&#xD;
&#xD;
on the strength of his cowardice, as she&#xD;
never could have done for his aban-&#xD;
donment. She pitied rather than scorn-&#xD;
ed him for his weakness, as you might&#xD;
suppose a fiery nature like hers would&#xD;
not have done-she who feared nothing&#xD;
on earth or in heaven, herself! That&#xD;
proved to me, more than every thing&#xD;
besides, the power - of her love for Mr.&#xD;
Adrian.&#xD;
And did she never hear from him&#xD;
again, Rena? Did she never write to&#xD;
him ?"&#xD;
" No, madam, she never did, either&#xD;
the one or the other. She believed in&#xD;
keeping promises, and would not for&#xD;
worlds have tempted him to break the&#xD;
oath he swore to Master Richard."&#xD;
" Yet, he had persuaded her to ignore&#xD;
her marriage vow, Rena, as he had done&#xD;
his own. This seems inconsistent."&#xD;
"I heard my mistress say one day that&#xD;
the Roman people struck their slaves&#xD;
when they set them free, and that, in this&#xD;
way she had received her freedom from&#xD;
my master's own hand. She never felt&#xD;
that she owed him any duty from that&#xD;
moment, madam. She ceased to feel&#xD;
ever after, that she belonged to him or&#xD;
was his wife. As to Mr. Adrian, my&#xD;
mistress had never suspected that le&#xD;
was not a single man until she heard&#xD;
what Master Richard said, and read&#xD;
that written "renunciation ;" that was&#xD;
what they called it I remember ; but, it&#xD;
contained a confession besides, a con-&#xD;
fession that Adrian was not his real&#xD;
name, and though he mentioned no&#xD;
other, that he was a married man.&#xD;
After this, of course, my mistress had&#xD;
nothing more to do with him in any&#xD;
way ; but the whole thing was kept&#xD;
secret by Master Richard's advice.&#xD;
He wrote her a long letteraas soon as&#xD;
ie could grasp a pen, that was the day&#xD;
before Madame Zavier came home, and&#xD;
strange to say it governed her behavior-&#xD;
He did not urge her to go home to&#xD;
Maurepas, though he advised it ; but be&#xD;
ej joined her whatever she did to let no&#xD;
one know what motive she had in&#xD;
mang thtjuny or what Mr. Adri-&#xD;
a thaento ur; and so she was&#xD;
pared to meet Madame Z-avier with&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
the explanation which was surely tru&#xD;
in one sense if not in another, that he&#xD;
husband's ill-treatment had driven he&#xD;
from a home to which she would retur&#xD;
no more under aiy circumstances, eve&#xD;
if compelled to make her living by th&#xD;
work of her own hands. Madame Zavie&#xD;
received her tenderly and tearfully, wit]&#xD;
true motherhood. She who had sol(&#xD;
her daughter for a price could not bea&#xD;
now to have it paid, nor to take crue&#xD;
blows that bruised that tender flesh, a.&#xD;
part of the contract. Yet, from the firs&#xD;
she might have known what must have&#xD;
occurred between them, in the very na&#xD;
ture of things, unsuited as they were."&#xD;
"You are a philosopher, Rena."&#xD;
"I don't know, madam, that I under-&#xD;
stand the word, but, if it means that I&#xD;
see every thing just as it is, perhaps I&#xD;
am. I sometimes wish that God had&#xD;
not made me'so clear-sighted," and she&#xD;
shook her head, smiling wistfully.&#xD;
" After my mistress came to herself,"&#xD;
she resumed, "she spent much time in&#xD;
considering who could have informed&#xD;
Master Richard of her design of joining&#xD;
Mr. Adrian at Memphis.&#xD;
But for that warning glance I should&#xD;
have fallen on my knees before her and&#xD;
confessed the whole, but that cold, com-&#xD;
manding eye rose ever before me when&#xD;
I thought to speak, and the words were&#xD;
stayed on my lips as if I had still been&#xD;
Master Richard's presence.&#xD;
"It must have been Mr. Roquette,"&#xD;
she said at last, " and he obtained his&#xD;
information from Frederick Tanque, no&#xD;
doubt; and  your mother, I suppose,&#xD;
plucked out your secret, poor Rena,&#xD;
against your will, and even against your&#xD;
knowledge. I was wrong to confide in&#xD;
one so young, wrong to have confided&#xD;
in any one, and yet, I am safe in their&#xD;
hands, I feel."&#xD;
"0, mistress, it was all for the best,"&#xD;
I ventured to say meekly, " since you&#xD;
hear now that Mr.Ady&#xD;
hearla ta Mr. Adrian was a married&#xD;
gentlemant"&#xD;
g"In heaven there is no marriage, nor&#xD;
iving in marinage, we are told, and had -&#xD;
tot oer tothe worst we could have died&#xD;
together," she said, casting her eyes up&#xD;
adcaping her hands on her bosom.&#xD;

&#xD;
e, "Besides, there was divorce for him as&#xD;
er well as for me in that land of liberty.&#xD;
er We could have waited patiently."&#xD;
A " But our dear church, mistress, for-&#xD;
a bids divorce, Master Richard says.&#xD;
e Would you leave the Holy Catholic&#xD;
r church for any man ?"&#xD;
[i " Have I not told you never to ques-&#xD;
d  tion me, Rena ?  Little fool, do you sup-&#xD;
,r pose I need give up my church because&#xD;
1 it chooses to cast me forth from its bosom&#xD;
s  for a mere difference of opinion?  My&#xD;
t creed is my own, and no displeasure of&#xD;
e church or priest could change that.&#xD;
What difference whether I went to mass&#xD;
or prayed alone in my chamber before&#xD;
my crucifix, as I did for years at Maur-&#xD;
pas ?"&#xD;
She was talking to herself, I knew,&#xD;
and not-to me, so I forbore to answer.&#xD;
"As for Richard Zavier," she con-&#xD;
tinued, "he has crushed me as ihe would&#xD;
not have done the worm in his path-as&#xD;
no other living being could have doe-&#xD;
can ever do again-not Adrian himself.&#xD;
But, oh, my love ! it was not just in you&#xD;
to forsake me thus, even though the&#xD;
cruel Spanish  steel threatened your&#xD;
heart's blood. Not just! Yet I thank&#xD;
heaven your precious life is spared, even&#xD;
if for eternal desolation."&#xD;
And she shook her head sorrowfully&#xD;
while tears rained down her cheeks.&#xD;
Her voice was so tender when she spoke&#xD;
the words, that it sounded like the&#xD;
cooing of a dove; but it fired every&#xD;
drop of my blood to see her weep.&#xD;
"Oh, mistress," I cried passionately,&#xD;
"I want you to hate Mr. Adrian, for his&#xD;
mean behavior. I wish Master Richard&#xD;
had killed him, before he signed that&#xD;
paper."&#xD;
" He has done nothing to me to make&#xD;
me hate him," she said calmly. o khe&#xD;
loved his life better than his troth to&#xD;
me, I have no word to say. It is not&#xD;
given to all men to be strong and brave,&#xD;
like cruel Richard Zavier ; nor to be&#xD;
constant, like wicked Maurepas." She&#xD;
smiled bitterly as she spoke these words.&#xD;
" Besides that, he had a wife and chil-&#xD;
dren to live for.; he had no right to die&#xD;
for one he had nevei' seen except in&#xD;
dreams--except in dreams!", shaking&#xD;

her head again, drearily. Then she&#xD;
went on : " Had he spoken lightly of me,&#xD;
matters would have been different-or&#xD;
even carelessly ; but he did not, or oh,&#xD;
how gladly my cruel kinsman would&#xD;
have told me every word. For one&#xD;
such I would have slain him with my&#xD;
own hand, even had I been obliged to&#xD;
reach him across the mountains. But&#xD;
as it is, we part in peace and love, and I&#xD;
can live upon the past through all the&#xD;
future."&#xD;
I knewshe still kept his letters in her&#xD;
sandalwood box, and that she referred&#xD;
to these.&#xD;
t I wonder you did not burn them,&#xD;
Rena, in your practical humanity," I ob-&#xD;
served.&#xD;
"No, madam, no ; I knew what com-&#xD;
fort they would prove to her in her&#xD;
long, lonely years ; but it was an office&#xD;
she performed herself one day, very sud-&#xD;
denly, as you shall hear."&#xD;
"Were hers never applied for, Rena ?"&#xD;
" Yes, madam, I believe so, without&#xD;
her knowledge though, by Master Rich-&#xD;
ard; but the answer came that they had&#xD;
all been honorably destroyed-each as it&#xD;
was received."&#xD;
I groaned aloud. Here was -another&#xD;
link yet wanting in the chain of iniquity.&#xD;
Those letters, with their fairy seal, and&#xD;
the motto, "Ic verrois," had met the eyes&#xD;
of his wife, I knew, lying 'carelessly in&#xD;
his secretary, and had aided in their&#xD;
mutual estrangement. That he preserv-&#xD;
ed them, them efore, was a certainty, and,&#xD;
perhaps, "Valerie" would have prefer-&#xD;
red that he should have done so, since it&#xD;
seemed she never made the slightest ef-&#xD;
fort to regain them. They might have&#xD;
prevented oblivion, if no more.&#xD;
" What occurred after all this, Rena'"&#xD;
"I will tell you, madam, if you will&#xD;
take patience to follow me in my own&#xD;
way, for I get all in confusion if you&#xD;
want to hurry me. As my eyes saw-&#xD;
and my ears heard, I speak. I can not&#xD;
put it all together quick as scholars can.&#xD;
I am obliged to walk step by step, up&#xD;
my ladder-even crawl sometime forit&#xD;
befits yo taolnownabout my mistress&#xD;
you shall learn presently."&#xD;
&#xD;
The effort Master Richard made to&#xD;
write that long letter to my mistress&#xD;
threw him back, I suppose, for, after&#xD;
that, he was quite ill again, and the doc-&#xD;
tor came and forbade him to read or&#xD;
write, or to have much light in his&#xD;
chamber, and made him take quinine&#xD;
and port wine, and such like, and sago&#xD;
jelly by the pint, fbr his appetite bad&#xD;
failed, and he seemed to be fading away&#xD;
for want of heart to eat, or smile, or care&#xD;
for any thing.&#xD;
But a great shock roused him. It was&#xD;
always so with that family-the Zaviers,&#xD;
I mean--they came to their feet when&#xD;
the need was, sick or well, living or&#xD;
dying, "equal to the emergency," as&#xD;
Madame Zavier said, whatever that might&#xD;
be. So that the very day after Doctor&#xD;
Duroc had pronounced my Master Rich-&#xD;
ard an ill man he was up and dressed and&#xD;
ready to take the boat for New Orleans,&#xD;
having notified Deemah to meet him with&#xD;
fresh linen at his plantation landing, so&#xD;
that he might accompany him below.&#xD;
I was sitting at the foot of Master&#xD;
Richard's bed, in the shadow, when&#xD;
Aunt Folly   came  in, followed  by&#xD;
Mr. Jules La Coste, one of our near&#xD;
neighbors at Maurepas, who went up to&#xD;
him cordially and then sat down by his&#xD;
pillow, near the half-open window, be-&#xD;
fore which was placed a table for his&#xD;
iced-water and medicines. A crack of&#xD;
light came through the parted shutters,&#xD;
for Master Richard could not submit to&#xD;
total darkness, and it fell on the two&#xD;
faces, leaning close together as they talk-&#xD;
ed, and thus I saw them.&#xD;
"I have a letter for you from M.&#xD;
Maurepas, Dr. Zavier," said Mr. La Coste,&#xD;
suddenly, laying it on the counterpane as&#xD;
he spoke-" one that requires an answer,&#xD;
which I hope you will be able to make&#xD;
satisfactory."&#xD;
"sI am neither able to write nor read&#xD;
to-day," said my Master Richard ; "but I&#xD;
can hear and think as well as ever I&#xD;
could; so perhaps you will do me the&#xD;
avor to read this letter aloud to me, Mr.&#xD;
La Coste-that is, if you already know&#xD;
the contents," he added, placing his hand&#xD;
upon it to wait for a reply, then remov-&#xD;
ing it as Mr. La Coste said briefly :&#xD;
&#xD;
"I do know them, I regret to say."&#xD;
"Then read," said Richard Zavier&#xD;
savagely.&#xD;
It was a letter from my master, accus&#xD;
ing my Master Richard of having per&#xD;
suaded away his wife from his roof and&#xD;
protection, and of having met herby ap&#xD;
pointment at Natchez and gone with&#xD;
her to " Les Boccages" during the ab-&#xD;
sence of her mother, for wrong pur&#xD;
poses, and it ended by challenging him&#xD;
to fight with him a "duello," when and&#xD;
where he chose, and with what arms he&#xD;
might select, or to be branded as a cow-&#xD;
ard forever, as well as a destroyer of&#xD;
female honor ; adding that Mr. Jules La&#xD;
Coste would act as his friend on the oc-&#xD;
casion, and was empowered to arrange&#xD;
every thing with the second of Dr. Zavier.&#xD;
There was a silence in the room after&#xD;
the letter had been read that lasted a&#xD;
few minutes, during which you could&#xD;
have heard a pin fall. Madam, I thought&#xD;
the beatings of my.heart must have be-&#xD;
trayed my presence, so still was the cham-&#xD;
ber., and so loud: did they sound in my&#xD;
own ears. But, I sat spell-bound, and&#xD;
soon my Master Richard spoke in clear,&#xD;
calm tones:&#xD;
"I can not accept this challenge con-&#xD;
scientiously, Mr. La Coste," he made re-&#xD;
ply. "I have done nothing to deserve&#xD;
it. I am innocent of all offense, such as&#xD;
he at least would deem offense, against&#xD;
the wife of M. Maurepas." '&#xD;
"An explanation will, no doubt, be&#xD;
thankfully received," said Mr. Jules La&#xD;
Cost, eagerly. "It was in this hope,&#xD;
and as the friend of both, that I under-&#xD;
took this office. What shall I say to&#xD;
M. Maurepas, since you are too ill to&#xD;
write?  Madame Zavier tells me that&#xD;
you had been with her son Francis at&#xD;
his father-in-law's near Natchez, where.&#xD;
his accident occurred, and advised with&#xD;
his physicians on the day before you&#xD;
came to Les Boccages, and that you&#xD;
met Madame Maurepas on the boat by&#xD;
accident--coming to visit her mother in&#xD;
consequence of having received informa-&#xD;
tion of her brother's injury. That state-&#xD;
inent would surely suffice, in connection&#xD;
with th e illness that prostrated you im-&#xD;
edaey on your arrival here, during&#xD;
&#xD;
which Madame Maurepas was of course&#xD;
obliged to remain, as Doctor Duroc can&#xD;
testify that you might not be neglected&#xD;
- under her mother's roof. Am I empow-&#xD;
- ered by you to make these assertions ?"&#xD;
"I have not seen my cousin since we&#xD;
- parted, an hour after our arrival, and in&#xD;
the presence of witnesses, in the drawing-&#xD;
room of Madame Zavier. I owe noth-&#xD;
ing to her attentions," said my Master&#xD;
Richard dryly, " that I am aware of, un-&#xD;
l less the occasional ministry of her ser-&#xD;
vant, in the absence of my own, may be&#xD;
considered a proof of care on her part&#xD;
(the little girl Rena, whom you may re-&#xD;
member at Maurepas). Nor had I aught&#xD;
to do with her voluntary exile from a&#xD;
home which had, however, been any thing&#xD;
but a happy one to her for years, though&#xD;
I have ventured so far as to suggest her&#xD;
return to it, and perhaps so offended her;&#xD;
I can not tell. She has surely acted&#xD;
very naturally and with perfect propriety&#xD;
in taking refuge with her mother under&#xD;
these adverse cicumstances. Where else&#xD;
could she have gone, Mr La Coste, with&#xD;
the same sense of security ?"&#xD;
" She (lid not know, then, of her&#xD;
brother's injury when she left home'?&#xD;
She meant to abandon Maurepas ?" ask-&#xD;
ed Mr. La Coste, earnestly.&#xD;
"I made her acquainted on the boat&#xD;
-having joined her for this purpose--&#xD;
with the occurrence, and knowing her&#xD;
nervous frame of mind, delayed details&#xD;
until we arrived at Les Boccages, after&#xD;
which I was too ill to return to Natchez,&#xD;
as Iliad meant to do almost immediately,&#xD;
and she had been also too much prostrat-&#xD;
ed, I hear, to leave her own chamber.&#xD;
This is all I have to say to M. Maurtpas.&#xD;
I owe him no further explanation."&#xD;
" I am afraid it will not suffice," said&#xD;
M. La Coste. " I never saw a man so&#xD;
indignant, and he believes you to be all-&#xD;
powerful with your cousin, whether for&#xD;
good or for evil."&#xD;
" Then I must take the consequences,"&#xD;
said my Master Richard. "Fight M. Mau-&#xD;
repas I will not., Nor will any word of~&#xD;
his mouth, nor of any man's, brand me&#xD;
as a coward so long as I am not 6ue."&#xD;
" It will be a street fight, then, Dr.&#xD;
Zavier, and he will have the advantage~&#xD;

&#xD;
of you. You know what a practiced shot&#xD;
M. Maurepas is."&#xD;
" I shall defend myself under such&#xD;
circumstances to the best of my ability."&#xD;
said my Master Richard, calmly; " and if&#xD;
I perish or if I slay I shall not 'be to-&#xD;
blame. In either case my conscience&#xD;
will acquit me. But it is a pity to drag&#xD;
a wife's good name through the gutters&#xD;
in that way. Let him think of that."&#xD;
" Have you shown yourself so care-&#xD;
ful of that lady's good name, Richard&#xD;
Zavier, that you should utter such re-&#xD;
proach ?" asked M. La Coste sternly and&#xD;
with flashing eyes.&#xD;
" It is not to you that I have to an-&#xD;
swer that question," said Master Richard&#xD;
between his set teeth. " If my right arm&#xD;
were not disabled you should not ask it&#xD;
with impunity, Jules La Coste. As it is,&#xD;
I must bear it, I suppose-at least for a&#xD;
time-but do not presume too far on my&#xD;
reply to M. Maurepas in your encroach-&#xD;
ments, or you may find yourself deceived,&#xD;
peaceable as you have so 'far found me."&#xD;
" I regret to have offended where I&#xD;
only meant to counsel," said M. La&#xD;
Cost, mildly. " I did not know until'&#xD;
now that you had met with an injury,&#xD;
]r. Zavier. How did you receive it ?&#xD;
Of what does it consist ?"&#xD;
Without noticing either his apology&#xD;
or inquiry my Master Richard went on,&#xD;
raising himself on his left arm as lie&#xD;
spoke, as lie had not done for days.&#xD;
" Have you come here to frighten these&#xD;
women to death with your tragic face&#xD;
and errand ?" he asked, almost fiercely.&#xD;
" In the, name of manhood I hope you&#xD;
did not betray your mission to Madame&#xD;
Zavier, nor-" lie hesitated.&#xD;
" Nothing of the sort, Dr. Zavier.&#xD;
What that lady communicated to me&#xD;
was voluntary. I only sought to take&#xD;
advantage of it to mend this unhappy&#xD;
difference, founded on error and mis-&#xD;
conception, I doubt not."&#xD;
Master Richard surveyed him severely.'&#xD;
Just then, watching my opportunity as&#xD;
Aunt Polly entered to invite M. La Coste&#xD;
to dinner, I stole away, unobserved by&#xD;
all but her, and hastened to the chamber&#xD;
of my mistress, to whom I rendered a&#xD;
tearful and truthful account of all that I&#xD;
&#xD;
had overheard. She, too, was roused to&#xD;
action by the same shock that had&#xD;
brought my Master Richard back to life.&#xD;
" Get me my gray silk dress, Rena,"&#xD;
she said. " I will go out to dinner to-day,&#xD;
or to dessert rather, since they are already&#xD;
commencing. I have a word to say to&#xD;
M. La Coste before he goes. Quick,&#xD;
child! No, never mind my hair. My white&#xD;
lace point will cover all deficiencies. I&#xD;
look like myself to-day, for the first time&#xD;
since I came to Les Boccages. Rena, I&#xD;
have put on my life-harness again, and&#xD;
I will wear it from this hour."&#xD;
" Then we shall go back to Maure-&#xD;
pas," I murmured, as I scented her&#xD;
handkerchief with mille fleurs, " and&#xD;
we shall all be happy again."&#xD;
" When the sun and the moon change&#xD;
places, not before, Rena, as far as I am&#xD;
concerned ; but you can go if you will.&#xD;
There is M. La Coste, going to pass right&#xD;
by Claireforte, where he can drop you,&#xD;
if you choose, with Mr. Roquette. Say,&#xD;
shall Isend you back to your mother ?"&#xD;
" Oh, no I no !" I groaned, shivering&#xD;
at the thought. " Maurepas would be&#xD;
a dungeon to me without you. Mis-&#xD;
tress, wherever you stay I will stay too,&#xD;
and be happy."&#xD;
"You are a good child, Rena," she&#xD;
said, swallowing hard ; then suddenly&#xD;
she threw her arms about me, and again&#xD;
she kissed me as she had done when&#xD;
we first met.&#xD;
Oh, madam, that kiss sealed our com-&#xD;
pact for life. It thrilled me like living&#xD;
fire. I could have died happily at that&#xD;
moment, so that I had died for her ;&#xD;
but it was ordered differently-my ser-&#xD;
vice was not that.:&#xD;
" Give me my fan, Rena," she said, turn-&#xD;
ing ,back at the threshold. " Cool as it&#xD;
is, I am strangely faint to-day, but I must&#xD;
see La Coste, and lie shall not have the&#xD;
satisfaction to know that I am miserable,&#xD;
and to gossip about me all through the&#xD;
lake neighborhood. I will let him see&#xD;
how scornfully I have turned my back on&#xD;
Maurpas and all connected with it-&#xD;
how entirely I have cut the Gordian knot."&#xD;
Then she went forth-with the step&#xD;
of a queen, and the stave of a song on&#xD;
her lip, to seek the dining-room.&#xD;
&#xD;
r   r&#xD;
it&#xD;
t&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
Very soon I followed her, and tool;&#xD;
my place, as at home, behind her chair.&#xD;
Dr. Duroc and Master Bernard Za-&#xD;
vier, a boy of ten years old, were at&#xD;
the table, besides my mistress and her&#xD;
mother and M. La Coste, when I went&#xD;
in. Every eye was turned on that beau-&#xD;
tiful, joyous lady, who sat peeling her&#xD;
bananas and sipping her wine as though&#xD;
she had never known a care, and talk-&#xD;
ing merrily fi rt to one and then the&#xD;
other.&#xD;
"I hope you are going to make some&#xD;
stay this time at Les Boccages," said&#xD;
Dr. Duroc. " When you were last here,&#xD;
none of the neighbors had the glimpse&#xD;
they coveted of Madame Maurepas."&#xD;
"And I," said M. La Coste, gravely,&#xD;
" trust, on the contrary, we shall soon&#xD;
again have the pleasure of seeing Ma-&#xD;
dame Maurbpas at Claireforte, where&#xD;
she is missed by high and low, old and&#xD;
young," and he looked at her suspi-&#xD;
ciously.&#xD;
I shall remain some time with&#xD;
mamma, M. La Coste," said my mistress,&#xD;
carelessly ; " she needs me more than&#xD;
ever now that Francis has married a&#xD;
wife and gone to live at Natchez, though&#xD;
I can never hope to replace wholly her&#xD;
dear, painstaking boy. You know lie&#xD;
has met with a very sad accident lately."&#xD;
" Yes, so I have heard. Iwave you&#xD;
seen your brother since he received his&#xD;
injury, Madame Maurepas ?"&#xD;
" No ; I was too much shocked at&#xD;
first to go to him, and afterward too&#xD;
much indisposed. I learned quite- ac-&#xD;
cidentally what had befallen him on my&#xD;
way hither, through Dr. Richard Zavier."&#xD;
"lHe spoke of that to-day. By the&#xD;
by, lie is very sick himself, it seems.&#xD;
He alluded to some injury to his arm-&#xD;
of what nature is it, Dr. Duroc? .You&#xD;
are in attendance, I presume ?"&#xD;
" Yes; it is a sword-thrust-a flesh&#xD;
wound, no more," said Dr. Duroc,&#xD;
shortly, shrugging his shoulders. He&#xD;
was one of those men who never liked&#xD;
to be questioned about his patients, and&#xD;
put aside the shop as much as possible.&#xD;
" A sword-thrust," repeated Madame&#xD;
Zavier, lifting her eyebrows and locking&#xD;
her hands. " Why, I never heard of&#xD;
&#xD;
that before. I had an idea it was a&#xD;
shoulder-strain merely. How on earth&#xD;
came Richard Zavier with a sword-&#xD;
thrust ? I did not know he had an&#xD;
enemy in the world."&#xD;
"And neither had he, mamma," re-&#xD;
joined my mistress. " It was a stab&#xD;
by mistake, no doubt-not intended for&#xD;
the saintly Richard Zavier."&#xD;
She spoke with ill-suppressed. deri-&#xD;
sion, and M. La Coate looked at her&#xD;
with amazement.&#xD;
" Aglite," said the mother reproving-&#xD;
ly, " our kinsman is no hypocrite. We&#xD;
have proved him long. "&#xD;
" I am sure I have insinuated nothing&#xD;
of the kind, mamma," she answered,&#xD;
lightly. " Richard is all very well in&#xD;
his place-out . of it, detestable. Now,&#xD;
it does not suit his style at all to play&#xD;
knight-errant."&#xD;
" I should think not, indeed," said M.&#xD;
La Coste, laughing low. (He was ac-&#xD;
counted a man of honor, but, like niost&#xD;
old bachelors, spiteful at times.) " I&#xD;
have never thought of Dr. Zavier in the&#xD;
light of a hero ; he would make a bet-&#xD;
ter preacher, or priest, than any thing&#xD;
else, I imagine."&#xD;
" Yes, his vocation is evident,"* re-&#xD;
joined my mistress, smiling. "It is a&#xD;
great pity he missed it. He would&#xD;
scarcely make much figure in romance,&#xD;
though there is no telling I , Those med-&#xD;
dlesome men try every thing in turn,&#xD;
and are sometimes surprisingly success-&#xD;
ful."&#xD;
" Cousin Richard ought to be a sol-&#xD;
dier," blurted out Bernard. " He ain't&#xD;
afraid of nothing, not even ghosts 1"&#xD;
He had a vague idea that his cousin&#xD;
Richard needed defending at this crisis.&#xD;
" That is right, Bernard-stand up&#xD;
for your friends," said his mother, look-&#xD;
ing reproachfully at my mistress, who&#xD;
only laughed and shook her head mer-&#xD;
rily in return.&#xD;
" Yes, that is my motto too, mamma,"&#xD;
she said, after a while ; "but we do&#xD;
not always know our friends. Evda&#xD;
the best of them betray us occasionally."&#xD;

THE "ROMANCE OF THE GREEN SEAL."&#xD;
&#xD;
" It is all very incomprehensible to&#xD;
me," remarked Madame Zavier, gravely,&#xD;
looking down.&#xD;
But, M. La Coste and Dr. Duroc be-&#xD;
ing well-bred men, feigned not to per-&#xD;
ceive her cause of discontent, and were&#xD;
soon discussing the new opera of Nor-&#xD;
ma with my mistress, which she ad-&#xD;
mired extravagantly.&#xD;
All this time .a cold and deadly&#xD;
sorrow was gnawing at her heart-&#xD;
strings.&#xD;
After dinner Dr. Duroc went to visit&#xD;
my master Richard, and 19. La Coste&#xD;
drew out his watch to see how long a&#xD;
time must elapse before the " Seneca "&#xD;
would come down from the next land-&#xD;
ing, where we could then hear her&#xD;
blowing off Ateam.&#xD;
" She has freight to take on there, I&#xD;
heard," said Madame Zavier, " and may&#xD;
be detained some hours, but it is a&#xD;
chance. However, we are so near the&#xD;
river that she can not fail to observe&#xD;
the signal flying at the woodpile, even&#xD;
if she does not stop to wood with us.&#xD;
So, be at ease, M. La Coste ; you shall&#xD;
certainly get off."&#xD;
"It has been accounted well-bred,"&#xD;
said my mistress, " to welcome the com-&#xD;
ing, -speed the parting, guest. But,&#xD;
come into the drawing-room. I have&#xD;
a word to say to you in private before&#xD;
we part, M. La Coste. Mamma, excuse&#xD;
us. I wish to send a message to Mau-&#xD;
repas. Come with us, Rena ; you, too,&#xD;
have some word, no doubt, to send to&#xD;
your mother and to Frederick Tanque."&#xD;
I entered, trembling. I knew what&#xD;
was coming then. I was to stand up&#xD;
to my testimony.&#xD;
"You must have thought me very&#xD;
hard on my cousin Richard, M. La Coste,&#xD;
at the dinner table," my mistress began,&#xD;
" but the fact is, I feel provoked with&#xD;
him for bringing himself and me into&#xD;
such a very absurd attitude with regard&#xD;
to M. Maurtpas. My little servant over-&#xD;
heard your conversation with Dr. Za-&#xD;
vier at his bedside. She was sitting in&#xD;
his room unperceived at the time, not&#xD;
by any direction of mine, but because&#xD;
she preferred to spend her leisure mo-&#xD;
ients in such dutiful attendance. She&#xD;
&#xD;
remembered with gratitude his long-&#xD;
continued kindness to her at Maurepas.&#xD;
In this way I have learned the history&#xD;
of that challenge, and the reply of Dr.&#xD;
Zavier. You must see how both must&#xD;
have annoyed me. Had my cousin in-&#xD;
terfered less in my affairs, (though for&#xD;
my own good, he fancies,) this dragon&#xD;
of jealousy would never have found a&#xD;
place in the breast of M. Iaurepas.&#xD;
As it is, my resolution remains unshaken&#xD;
-to return to Claireforte no more.&#xD;
Belle Garde Parish has seen the last of&#xD;
me and I of it. I have been manu-&#xD;
mitted according to the old established&#xD;
Roman fashion-by a blow ; and I dis-&#xD;
claim all allegiance toward him who in-&#xD;
flicted it-ever a cruel master  Nay,&#xD;
more-I shall seek diligently, from this&#xD;
time, to wipe his very existence out of&#xD;
my memory."&#xD;
" A blow, Madame Maurepas -did&#xD;
you"'say a blow? Did any one witness&#xD;
the outrage ?"&#xD;
" Two equally insignificant person-&#xD;
ages, no doubt, in the opinion of M.&#xD;
Maurepas-this child and the all-seeing&#xD;
Father," she said, with bitter derision,&#xD;
" neither of whom could or would ap-&#xD;
pear against him, as lie knew, in a court&#xD;
of earthly justice. But, in heaven, Mr.&#xD;
La Coste, this little slave,"-laying her&#xD;
hand firily on my shoulder-" will be&#xD;
permitted to testify in my behalf before&#xD;
the King of Kings, himself my chiefest&#xD;
witness!" &#xD;
Her uplifted, beautiful face, her flash-&#xD;
ing, tearful eyes, her hand pointed on&#xD;
high, her proud and modest dignity,&#xD;
might have melted toward her a sterner&#xD;
heart than that of M. La Coste. He&#xD;
gazed upon her for a time, lost in amaze-&#xD;
ment and admiration, scarce knowing&#xD;
what words to speak.&#xD;
" Madame," he said, at last, " I came&#xD;
here not alone to serve my boyhood's&#xD;
friend, Leon Maurepas, but to endeavor&#xD;
to heal a family breach, most painful in&#xD;
itself, and distressing to many hearts.&#xD;
I have ill succeeded, I fear, but what I&#xD;
can do shall be done-to reconcile hus-&#xD;
band and wife, friends and relatives, so&#xD;
grievously divided now. In our church,&#xD;
you know, no divorce is possible, and&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
l&#xD;
'-.&#xD;
9..'~f&#xD;
&#xD;
it behooves married people to forget and&#xD;
forgive."&#xD;
"I ask, simply, a ' sep ration des biens,'&#xD;
M. La Coste, which means nothing, as&#xD;
far as I am concerned, but the right to&#xD;
live apart in peace from my husband.&#xD;
To M. Maurepas I took no dower, and&#xD;
in all these years he has accumulated&#xD;
nothing; I shall take little away except&#xD;
this child-this slave-that he gave to&#xD;
me long since by a deed that has been&#xD;
recorded. I shall never return to M.&#xD;
Maurepas, never look upon' his face&#xD;
again if I can help it ; but of this as-&#xD;
sure him, that if there is one person on&#xD;
this earth I like less than he who was&#xD;
my husband, that man is Richard Za-&#xD;
vier. To M. Maurepas I am indifferent,&#xD;
but my cousin I detest /" and the last&#xD;
word came through her set teeth like&#xD;
the hiss of a serpent.&#xD;
I shrank from  the hand that still&#xD;
lingered on my shoulder with a sudden&#xD;
shiver that did not pass unnoticed by&#xD;
my mistress. She grew strangely pale,&#xD;
and motioned me to leave the parlor,&#xD;
but she dill not remain long behind me,&#xD;
and Madame Zavier had M. La Coste&#xD;
all to herself on the portico for the hour&#xD;
that intervened before the steamboat&#xD;
came to her landing.&#xD;
On the very next day my Master&#xD;
Richard left "Les Boccages " without&#xD;
seeking to say adieu to my mistress,&#xD;
and we heard through Mr. La Coste,&#xD;
that the matter had been made up&#xD;
through his intervention between M.&#xD;
Maurepas and Dr. Zavier without further&#xD;
exposure. We seldom, saw my Master&#xD;
Richard thereafter. He came only at&#xD;
intervals to pay Madame Zavier some&#xD;
small dividend of an interest he managed&#xD;
for leer, and the interviews between the&#xD;
cousins was always reserved and cold,&#xD;
and conducted before witnesses. Ma-&#xD;
dame Zavier attributed this estrangement&#xD;
to the injudicious effort she supposed to&#xD;
have been made by Richard Zavier to&#xD;
reunite man and wife, and accused her1&#xD;
daughter of being more implacable than&#xD;
bame a Christian toward her cousin&#xD;
T0o such reproaches my mistress made&#xD;
noereply, and afforded no explanatiorij&#xD;
Sh  ecame indeed, strangely cold and  t&#xD;
&#xD;
. _&#xD;
&#xD;
apathetic after the first excitement caused&#xD;
by my Master Richard's difficulty with&#xD;
M. Maurepas died away ; and heard of&#xD;
her husband's ruin, and the approaching&#xD;
sale of his effects, with a stolid indif-&#xD;
ference that shocked   and  surprised&#xD;
Madame Zavier, who was herself a very&#xD;
sensitive woman.&#xD;
For months together I never saw her&#xD;
take her pen, or unclose a book, excer t&#xD;
her breviary (yet she never went to con-&#xD;
fessional), nor stick a needle in a bit of&#xD;
embroidery, nor do any of those things&#xD;
that had once so pleasantly filled her&#xD;
time at Maurepas. Joy comes some-&#xD;
times from small sources to the darkest&#xD;
heart, however.             _&#xD;
One day a man and woman came&#xD;
from an upward-bound steamboat, and&#xD;
opened the gate of Madame Zavier's&#xD;
front yard. The man was leading a&#xD;
small gray mare, beautifully caparisoned ;&#xD;
the woman bore a harp in her arms&#xD;
which she carried with difficulty, even&#xD;
with the assistance of her companion.&#xD;
' These were Frederick Tanque and&#xD;
my mother, who had been purchased by&#xD;
M. Landry, and were sent now,.with his&#xD;
compliments, they told us, with some&#xD;
articles for my mistress, presented by&#xD;
the creditors, because, as was asserted,&#xD;
she had in no way opposed their claims,&#xD;
by setting up a right of dower as she&#xD;
could have done. The first tears my&#xD;
mistress had shed .for months were&#xD;
poured on Calypso's neck ! There were&#xD;
other articles, beside, on the steamboat&#xD;
for my. mistress-her secretary, her&#xD;
book-case and books, some pictures she&#xD;
had loved, especially her large folding&#xD;
Chinese-screen and flower-stand, her&#xD;
marble bath-tub, and toilet-stand, the&#xD;
chairs she had covered with her own&#xD;
embroidery, her music and music-easel,&#xD;
all of which she had left behind" and&#xD;
beside these a case of silver.&#xD;
She received these things with un-&#xD;
affected delight, and I shall ever believe&#xD;
her life was saved by such means, for a&#xD;
gallop on Calypso, and a few hours at~&#xD;
her harp, never failed to revive her when&#xD;
all other means had failed.&#xD;
Madam, my mistress was ignorant&#xD;
*hen as I was, of the true reading of&#xD;

the law. In Louisiana, marriage is a&#xD;

to be bought in at sale for my mistress,&#xD;
as if at her own request and expense,&#xD;
and had obtained leave from M. Landry&#xD;
to send them up by her old slaves, as a&#xD;
solace to her feelings.&#xD;
They remained with us a fortnight&#xD;
by permission. After that I never saw&#xD;
my mother. She died very soon after&#xD;
her return to Maurepas, which M.&#xD;
Landry had bought for his eldest 'son ;&#xD;
and Frederick Tanque perished in re-&#xD;
bellion against his master-the sternest&#xD;
slaveholder in all the Belle Garde Parish&#xD;
-fighting in the swamps as I have told&#xD;
you. But in truth, my step-father had&#xD;
been noted always for his overbearing&#xD;
temper, and M. Maurepas was the only&#xD;
man who could ever have governed&#xD;
him, for he was his foster-brother and&#xD;
his master in the true sense of the word&#xD;
-the man he loved with all his faults,&#xD;
even more than he feared him, until&#xD;
estrangement cane, for a time, after that&#xD;
cruel punishment of mine.&#xD;
" What became    of your master,&#xD;
Rena ?"&#xD;
" Madam, he led a wicked life in New&#xD;
Orleans, among the gamblers, and man-&#xD;
aged to get along in some poor way. I&#xD;
never saw him again until his high&#xD;
spirit was broken and his health was&#xD;
gone. Then I befriended him to the&#xD;
best of my poor ability. I was free,&#xD;
then-married to Deemab, who had his&#xD;
own time from Dr. Richard Zavier, with&#xD;
permission to buy himself whenever he&#xD;
made enough money, which he did be-&#xD;
fore many years. So we were happy&#xD;
together, with our children growing&#xD;
around us, and were glad to serve my&#xD;
master in his misfortunes, as was our&#xD;
duty, seeing that he had no friend nor&#xD;
money left."&#xD;
"A truly Christian return, Rena, for&#xD;
all the ill-usage you had received at his&#xD;
hands ; but, was your mistress content&#xD;
to be wholly dependent on her mother ?&#xD;
Did she never regain her energies ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
Yes, madam, in the course of time;&#xD;
and she obtained an engagement wilh&#xD;
one of the New   Orleans papers-the&#xD;
Delta, I think-and wrote an article&#xD;
every week, and drew her money for it,&#xD;
but she no longer signed herself 'Valerie'&#xD;
as she used to do, but simply 'Aglae,'&#xD;
which, indeed, was the name she was&#xD;
best known by, and which seemed most&#xD;
natural to niy ears and eyes."&#xD;
" And did she ever forgive Richard&#xD;
Zavier ?"&#xD;
" Never, madam, as long as she had&#xD;
her will about her. I never heard her&#xD;
speak his name except when she spoke&#xD;
to himself, which she always did politely&#xD;
when he came to see her mother. He&#xD;
took it hard, I think, but he never com-&#xD;
plained, and was firm as a rock, frozen&#xD;
up though as it seemed, even to his&#xD;
smile."&#xD;
" And Mr. Adrian-what of him ?"&#xD;
"" Oh, she never named his name&#xD;
neither, but I know she thought of him&#xD;
all the same. She wore his picture next&#xD;
her heart, and kept his letters carefully&#xD;
in her little sandal-wood box,4and some-&#xD;
times she looked over them, but on&#xD;
those days, she shut herself up in her&#xD;
room and no one saw her face-not&#xD;
even Bernard the little brother that she&#xD;
loved the most. When we had been&#xD;
about two years with Madame Zavier,&#xD;
Master Jacques was drowp.ed while fish-&#xD;
ing in Bayou River, and there was great&#xD;
distress in the. house, for he was the&#xD;
favorite son of his mother-a bright,&#xD;
noble-looking boy of about fifteen; and&#xD;
with more brains in his head than all&#xD;
the rest of the sons put together-so&#xD;
Master Richard thought ; but my mis-&#xD;
tress loved Bernard best, with his sweet&#xD;
girlish face and tender ways, blue eyes&#xD;
and waving brown hair, so like his&#xD;
mother, while all the rest were Zaviers,&#xD;
my mistress as well-Spanish from the&#xD;
eyes to the heels. I believe it was her&#xD;
nature to love every one of that light&#xD;
complexion, so unlike herself. It was&#xD;
that taste, perhaps, that drew her so&#xD;
strongly to M. Adrian after she saw hie&#xD;
likeness, but, as far as I have seen, folks&#xD;
of that sort are cold and cruel-minded."&#xD;
" Not always, Rena. You have been&#xD;

THE "ROMANCE OF THE GREEN SEAL."&#xD;
&#xD;
unfortunate in your observations, that is&#xD;
all. But tell me, did your mistress re-&#xD;
ceive much society in the house of her&#xD;
mother, or lead the life of a recluse ?"&#xD;
" Neither, madam. She never refus-&#xD;
ed to come into the drawing room to&#xD;
welcome her mother's friends; but if a&#xD;
gentleman called on her alone she re-&#xD;
fused to see him.  Judge Eustis was_&#xD;
madly in love with my mistress and she&#xD;
knew it, and he would have moved&#xD;
heaven and earth to get a decree of di-&#xD;
vorce for her if she would have consent-&#xD;
ed. Even Madame Zavier implored her&#xD;
to let him proceed-Catholic as she was&#xD;
-but my mistress gave always a cold&#xD;
denial, and from the time that lie sug-&#xD;
gested the subject, never spoke to Judge&#xD;
Eustis again. Yet he was a very hand-&#xD;
some man, not more than thirty-three, a&#xD;
young widower with one child, and pos-&#xD;
sessed of the finest estate in that parish."&#xD;
" I suppose lie wanted the right color-&#xD;
ing, Rena ?"&#xD;
" Yes, madam," she rejoined, gravely,&#xD;
"lhe was was a true Southerner, dark and&#xD;
pale, but with chestnut hair, and steel-&#xD;
gray eyes, very noble-looking we all&#xD;
thought- a man who could put one&#xD;
hand on his saddle and vault on his&#xD;
horse, and guide him like a lamb after-&#xD;
ward. His slaves were devoted to him;&#xD;
one word from his mouth was all any of&#xD;
them needed, and he always acted for&#xD;
their good."&#xD;
"It is truly a pity your mistress&#xD;
could not have fancied him, Rena."&#xD;
." I loved her the better for it, madam&#xD;
-I did, indeed, this faithfulness of hers."&#xD;
" But Adrian, at that time, was a mere&#xD;
shadow, Rena, a phantom of her im-&#xD;
agination. There could have been no&#xD;
reality about the feeling."&#xD;
" Oh, madam, she was not like other&#xD;
people ; she only needed something to&#xD;
dream about. I doubt sometimes whether&#xD;
she would have been happy as the wife&#xD;
of any man after she found out faults&#xD;
and follies such as all men have ; but still,&#xD;
I may be mistaken, and if ever man and&#xD;
woman were made to love each other, it&#xD;
surely was my mistress and Mr. Adrian."&#xD;
Rena's inconsistency warned me to&#xD;
desist from all further attempt at argu-&#xD;
&#xD;
ment, so I suffered her to proceed in her&#xD;
own way.&#xD;
There was an interval of trunk-pack-&#xD;
ing, I remember, during which she&#xD;
sighed frequently, as if oppressed by&#xD;
thought, and shook    her head from&#xD;
time to time in a sorrowful and, absent-&#xD;
minded fashion, that ill comported with&#xD;
her careful folding and placing of my&#xD;
garments. When all was over she set-&#xD;
tied herself again on a low seat, to con-&#xD;
tinue her narrative, now evidently fast&#xD;
drawing to a close. I knew more of the&#xD;
catastrophe than she supposed, and was&#xD;
more closely interested than she could&#xD;
imagine in tracing, step by step, the&#xD;
events that led to so disastrous a con-&#xD;
clusion.&#xD;
To hear these related by truthful and&#xD;
unsophisticated lips was my chief ob-&#xD;
ject in seeking her acquaintance, for her&#xD;
character for uprightness and singleness&#xD;
of purpose had preceded her advent to&#xD;
my lodgings.&#xD;
Rena was, at the time I write of, a&#xD;
woman of thirty-five years of age, and&#xD;
the mother of grown-up daughters-&#xD;
though she seemed ydunger for her years&#xD;
than white women usually do, owing to&#xD;
the thick and velvety texture of the&#xD;
quadroon skin, which resists, with its&#xD;
clay-colored opaqueness, the action of&#xD;
sun and storm. She had, too, fine teeth,&#xD;
clear dark eyes, an agreeable smile, small&#xD;
features, and an oval face, entirely sad in&#xD;
repose.&#xD;
There was about her something of re-&#xD;
finement which was rare in one of her&#xD;
class and grade, and her movements&#xD;
were, like those of many of her race,&#xD;
marked with a certain undulating, supple&#xD;
grace that enchained the eye.&#xD;
She wore the bright-colored head-ker-&#xD;
chief and large gold ear-rings common to&#xD;
the mulatto of the south, and" though&#xD;
well chosen as to color and effect, her&#xD;
garb was homely as became her condi-&#xD;
tion. The only mark of luxury I ob-&#xD;
served about her was in the constant use&#xD;
of a fine and, speckless linen cambric&#xD;
handkerchief, sometimes slightly lace-&#xD;
trimmed, which she handled as ladies&#xD;
alone usually manage these articles-&#xD;
mere necessities to the well-bred and&#xD;

&#xD;
luxuries to the vulgar. It was plain to&#xD;
see that Rena had been early accustomed&#xD;
to the accessories of refinement. On her&#xD;
bosom reposed a crucifix of gold, the&#xD;
symbol of her faith, into which, despite&#xD;
her nearly white complexion, a little of&#xD;
the Fetish spirit entered. Her mother,&#xD;
she had informed me, was of Obi origin,&#xD;
or rather ancestry, and the strain of&#xD;
blood was still evidenced in this remote&#xD;
descendant of magicians.&#xD;
PART      V.C.&#xD;
"I HAD meant to tell you, madam,"&#xD;
said Rena, lifting her eyes to mine, after&#xD;
a long interval of silence, " what a con-&#xD;
solation my mistress was to her mother&#xD;
after Master Jacques' death. She seemed&#xD;
to forget her own troubles in the sorrow&#xD;
of Madame Zavier, and their hearts came,&#xD;
very near together for the first time since&#xD;
the marriage of my mistress. Before that&#xD;
evil period she had loved her mother very&#xD;
devotedly, far more than her splendid&#xD;
father, whose picture she. so closely re-&#xD;
sembled herself ; but cold shadow had&#xD;
crept between them after she was " bar-&#xD;
tered away," as she always felt it, " sold&#xD;
for Les Boccages," she would say some-&#xD;
times, as if trees and flowers could repay&#xD;
her for the sacrifice of a human soul&#xD;
and the blood and body of the child !&#xD;
It was not often my mistress spoke so&#xD;
bitterly-only when she was pressed to&#xD;
the wall by M. Maurepas--for, as I have&#xD;
said, she was happy in her own gifts,&#xD;
before the serpent of the " Green Seal "&#xD;
dragged himself across her pathway.&#xD;
But I had learned from such words how&#xD;
her heart was weaned from her mother,&#xD;
and how she had resented her exile&#xD;
from home and friends.&#xD;
All this was over now, and she for-&#xD;
gave Madame Zavier entirely, and went&#xD;
back to the old confidences and affec-&#xD;
tions she bore her when a little child.&#xD;
They had lived at " Les Boccages" only&#xD;
in the summer time, during the life of&#xD;
M. Frangois Zavier, but she had always&#xD;
loved it, partly, I used to think, because&#xD;
Master Richard was her playmate there.&#xD;
&#xD;
The death of Master Jacques, so sud-&#xD;
den and sorrowful, had softened all her&#xD;
nature, as it seemed to me---unsealed&#xD;
some spring that had been stopped up&#xD;
before ; and that inward happiness came&#xD;
back to her, that I told you about, which&#xD;
made her so satisfied at Maurepas, and&#xD;
she enjoyed every thing with a fresh&#xD;
delight.&#xD;
She ordered the laying out of a par-&#xD;
terre, and selected the flowers, and helped&#xD;
to plant them herself, for Madame Zavier&#xD;
suffered no idle hands about her house,&#xD;
where all was frugality and care, but&#xD;
kept her people, with very few excep-&#xD;
tions, employed in her cotton-fields, from&#xD;
whence came all her livelihood. Hers was&#xD;
a small place at best, and it was as much&#xD;
as she could do from its proceeds to sus-&#xD;
tain her household and educate her sons.&#xD;
But, she was a famous manager, quiet&#xD;
as she seemed, and provided well for all.&#xD;
No more " Cobbler of Brusa " illumina-&#xD;
tions now!    A pair of wax candles&#xD;
nightly, were all my mistress afforded&#xD;
herself, and these she bought with her&#xD;
own money. The old mistress used&#xD;
myrtle candles of her own making,&#xD;
which were almost as clear as Bougies,&#xD;
and smelt delightfully, but my mistress&#xD;
complained that the odor sickened her&#xD;
and made her faint, and she had her&#xD;
own way.&#xD;
I remember well, however, how at&#xD;
Maurepas, she had always burned a&#xD;
myrtle wax night's taper, out of respect&#xD;
for old usages, and she had a notion then&#xD;
that the smell was healthy, and kept off&#xD;
headache, the only sickness she suffered&#xD;
from in those happy days."*&#xD;
" Happy days, Rena"?  How can you&#xD;
call those days happy that you have&#xD;
described to me as so bitter and intole-&#xD;
rable ? I should think you would have&#xD;
been far happier at Madame Zavier's,&#xD;
away from cruel Maurepas."&#xD;
* The myrtle wax candle is made from the se-&#xD;
rum of the myrtle-berry, a substance closely re-&#xD;

"No, madam, no; my happiest days&#xD;
and hers were spent at Maurepas, in spite&#xD;
of the ill-usage we now and then received.&#xD;
There we had hope, at least, and security&#xD;
from strangers, and we enjoyed our times&#xD;
of peace all the more for the little&#xD;
storms we encountered sometimes. Be-&#xD;
sides, it was the rightful home of my&#xD;
mistress, and mine ; and there is much&#xD;
in that. She was always first at Man-&#xD;
repas, as she could not and did not wish&#xD;
to be in any other house, even her moth-&#xD;
er's."&#xD;
"'True, true, Rena; those are consid-&#xD;
erations ; but violence and insult are&#xD;
insufferable."&#xD;
"She found them so, and gave up all&#xD;
the rest on that account ; but I shall&#xD;
ever think my master's money-troubles&#xD;
were maddening him when he struck&#xD;
her, and she did not love him enough to&#xD;
make allowance for them."&#xD;
"Yet, you say she seemed happy&#xD;
again, Rena, after your Master Jacques'&#xD;
death had softened her nature ?"&#xD;
"Yes, happy, but in a different way-&#xD;
more calm, more quiet, more patient,&#xD;
then at Maurbpas, but not half so bird-&#xD;
like and joyous. She gave more atten-&#xD;
tion to her religious duties than she had&#xD;
done before, and when we were in New&#xD;
Orleans stayed with her old teachers and&#xD;
went to the confessional for the first time&#xD;
in years. It did her good, I think."&#xD;
" Did she accompany Madame Zavier&#xD;
to the city ?"  ,&#xD;
"No, she went alone, and about her&#xD;
own affairs, and made her home with&#xD;
her aunt, the Abbess Magdalene. When&#xD;
I say alone, I mean without friend or&#xD;
escort. She took me with her, of course.&#xD;
My mistress went down to the city to&#xD;
sell her diamonds (the last gift her father&#xD;
had made her), for her mother's benefit.&#xD;
The year that master Jacques was&#xD;
drowned, the cotton-crop failed at Ma-&#xD;
dame Zavier's place, owing to overflow ;&#xD;
and two of her best hands died of fever,&#xD;
and she, the proudest woman you ever&#xD;
saw, scarcely knew where to turn for&#xD;
assistance. So without saying a word&#xD;
to any one about her situation, my mis-&#xD;
tress took her casket of jewels and went&#xD;
dowvn to see the jewelers in New Or-&#xD;
&#xD;
leans and sell her diamonds. She car-&#xD;
ried them all the way in her own sachel,&#xD;
for fear of an accident to the boat, when&#xD;
baggage would be abandoned even if life&#xD;
was saved, and slept with them under&#xD;
her pillow. But we reached our des-&#xD;
tination safely, and before night . my&#xD;
mistress had deposited in bank forty-five'&#xD;
hundred dollars to the credit of Madame'&#xD;
Maria Zavier, having retained three hun-&#xD;
dred for her own expenses. The dia-&#xD;
monds had cost over five thousand.&#xD;
"Now. Eugene will not be obliged to&#xD;
leave Oakland College," she said, with&#xD;
joy sparkling in her eyes, when we were&#xD;
alone, that evening, in one chamber;&#xD;
"and my mother will not be compelled&#xD;
to ask advances from commission mer-&#xD;
chants-those cormorants of the earth-&#xD;
or go in debt for supplies for her negroes&#xD;
and household. I never knew what an&#xD;
immense sum forty-five hundred dollars&#xD;
was, before, Rena-the price of a single&#xD;
cashmere shawl I saw to-day I But, my&#xD;
dear mother has taught me how much&#xD;
comfort may be had for little money&#xD;
when judiciously disposed. I used to&#xD;
be as extravagant as my poor father,&#xD;
and fearfully inconsiderate about expend-&#xD;
iture."&#xD;
" Oh, mistress," I ventured to rejoin,&#xD;
"I am sure you never asked for much,&#xD;
and what my master chose to buy for&#xD;
you with his own money' you had a&#xD;
right to take and keep. You stayed&#xD;
mostly at home, and never wore such&#xD;
fine clothes or drove so fine a carriage&#xD;
as the rest of the lake ladies."&#xD;
" That is true," she said, clasping her&#xD;
hands in that solemn, childish way she&#xD;
had ; " but, remember those illumina-&#xD;
tions ! Many a poor mother would be&#xD;
thankful for an inch of candle to see her&#xD;
child's dying face by, and I flared out&#xD;
dozens every night at Maurbpas, with&#xD;
open windows and the wind blowing&#xD;
across the room. It is a matter of seri-&#xD;
ous self-reproach to me."&#xD;
I could scarcely keep from smiling-as&#xD;
she said these words, but I managed to&#xD;
be grave, for, just.then, the holy bishop&#xD;
knocked at the door, coming to talk&#xD;
with her an hour before administering&#xD;
the sacrament which she was to take&#xD;

&#xD;
the next day at the cathedral. I sat&#xD;
very quietly in one corner while he re-&#xD;
mained, and felt greatly consoled my-&#xD;
self by his pious advice and conversa-&#xD;
tion. Not once was the name of M.&#xD;
Maurepas mentioned by either one. -&#xD;
On our way to the cathedral, the&#xD;
next morning, we met M. Maurepas,&#xD;
face to face. I never knew before what&#xD;
metal my mistress was made of. She&#xD;
passed him with her vail up, without&#xD;
moving a muscle of her face, or chang-&#xD;
ing color in the least ; but he reeled&#xD;
from one side of the pavement to the&#xD;
otlker, and staggered like a- drunken&#xD;
man, turning red and pale in quick suc-&#xD;
cession, and at last leaning against the&#xD;
wall of the cathedral for support. I&#xD;
saw him there as we went up the steps,&#xD;
but my mistress never seemed to have&#xD;
noticed him at all ; and but for a re-&#xD;
mark of mine later, I might have be-&#xD;
lieved that she had not, seen him as she&#xD;
passed.&#xD;
" My master had a very distressed&#xD;
look," I said, when I was undressing.&#xD;
her that evening ; " did you not think&#xD;
so, mistress ?"&#xD;
" Have you a master any longer, Re-&#xD;
na ?  I thought you had only a mistress&#xD;
now."&#xD;
" M. Maurepas, I mean-your hus-&#xD;
band, my own dear mistress, that we&#xD;
met on Jackson square to-day, as we&#xD;
went up to the cathedral." I, could not&#xD;
forbear bursting into tears, for, with all&#xD;
his faults, I pitied him from the bottom&#xD;
of my heart. Not so my mistress.&#xD;
" He has cause to be thankful to God,"&#xD;
she said, in a hard, cold voice, " that lie&#xD;
is permitted to expiate his ill-conduct in&#xD;
this world rather than the next ; else,&#xD;
everlasting hell-fire might be his portion.&#xD;
That man is nothing to me, Rena; never&#xD;
mention him again in my presence ;"&#xD;
and she went on reading the book the&#xD;
bishop had sent her, as calmly as though&#xD;
we had not spoken of M. Maur pas.&#xD;
Then I knew that what she had said&#xD;
was the bare truth, and no boastful fancy,&#xD;
madam. I knew that my niaster was&#xD;
dead to her for ever, and that she had&#xD;
-indeed " wiped him out of the tablets of&#xD;
her brain." Those were her words, I&#xD;
&#xD;
remember.   She always said things dif-&#xD;
ferent from other people. One thing I&#xD;
learned, however : that, from that day,&#xD;
my mistress always wore that small,&#xD;
sharp poniard she had carried so much&#xD;
at Maurepas, but laid aside of late.&#xD;
"I will be prepared for him," she mur-&#xD;
mured, "if ever he lays his hand on me&#xD;
again, either in wrath or kindness. One&#xD;
would fare as ill with him as the other"&#xD;
-and that old look flashed in her eyes&#xD;
once more.&#xD;
When we went back to Les Boccages,&#xD;
my mistress told her mother what her&#xD;
errand had been in New Orleans, and&#xD;
Madame Zavier was greatly touched and&#xD;
comforted at this proof of pious con-&#xD;
sideration.&#xD;
They were very happy together, mad-&#xD;
am, for a season; and every one in and&#xD;
about the house was devoted to my mis-&#xD;
tress, and, through her, to me ; but&#xD;
somehow my heart was mostly sad at&#xD;
Les Boccages. I felt from the first as&#xD;
my mistress said she always did before&#xD;
a thunderstorm-as if something was&#xD;
coming to crush me-and every new&#xD;
sound, or sudden   arrival, made me&#xD;
tremble.&#xD;
My greatest joy was on those rare oc-&#xD;
casions when my master Richard and&#xD;
Deemah would come for a few days.&#xD;
It was like the sunshine breaking through&#xD;
cold, gray clouds to nie, to see those&#xD;
friendly faces-one so noble and beau-&#xD;
tiful, the other so honest and affectionate.&#xD;
It was in this way I got accustomed to&#xD;
and finally attached to Deemah, though&#xD;
I never knew what it was to love him,&#xD;
or any one-"   She hesitated, then add-&#xD;
ed, in low tones, as if of soliloquy: "who&#xD;
could or would stoop to love me again 1"&#xD;
For a moment her face was clouded&#xD;
and downcast; then, rousing herself as&#xD;
from reverie, she proceeded with re-&#xD;
newed energy.&#xD;
I think I have brought you pretty&#xD;
well up to the time, madam, when the&#xD;
steamer Geraldine exploded opposite to&#xD;
the plantation of Madame Zavier. It&#xD;
was a perfect wreck ; half of the pas-&#xD;
sengers were killed, and the rest more&#xD;
or less fearfully injured. There were&#xD;
boats employed for many hours in&#xD;

&#xD;
rescuing sufferers from the water. Some&#xD;
of these were brought to our landing,&#xD;
and, as the house of Madame Zavier&#xD;
was not large, she had her cotton-gim&#xD;
hastily fitted up as a hospital. It was&#xD;
April, and most of the cotton had been&#xD;
baled and sent off, so there was ample&#xD;
accommodation for all. She herself,&#xD;
her women and Dr. Duroc, moved&#xD;
among them constantly, dressing their&#xD;
wounds and ministering to their wants&#xD;
for several days.&#xD;
My mistress would have gone also to&#xD;
help care for them, had not an object&#xD;
that required all her attention detained&#xD;
her at home. Just as she had opened&#xD;
the gate to go down to the cotton-gin, a&#xD;
man staggered in, with singed hair and&#xD;
a blackened face, holding up two terri-&#xD;
bly scalded hands before her, and im-&#xD;
ploring her to suffer him to go to her&#xD;
house and receive immediate attention.&#xD;
She did not hesitate, but taking him by&#xD;
one arm, motioned to me to support&#xD;
him by the other, and thus we led him,&#xD;
groaning at every step, back through&#xD;
the garden walks we had just traversed,&#xD;
and so up the long steps of the portico&#xD;
and into the ell room, in wichl gentle-&#xD;
men were always lodged. Aunt Polly&#xD;
was called, and his wounds were dressed&#xD;
with linseed oil and flour, and he was&#xD;
placed in bed, which trembled under&#xD;
him  as the pain shook his frame. I&#xD;
never saw any one suffer as he did ; but&#xD;
he was soon asleep under a strong opi.&#xD;
ate, anid awoke refreshed. From  that&#xD;
time he began steadily to improve.&#xD;
His face was quite uninjured, as we&#xD;
found after washing away the soot that&#xD;
almost covered .it, but his hair was&#xD;
burnt off quite close to his head. His&#xD;
very eyebrows had been scorched. His&#xD;
hands healed rapidly under our simple&#xD;
treatment, and a fortnight from the time&#xD;
of his arrival, Mr. Marstyn was able to&#xD;
show his white teeth, and laugh and&#xD;
talk with my mistress and Madame Za-&#xD;
vier. His golden-brown curls were com.-&#xD;
mencing to twist themselves again, and&#xD;
his eyebrows looked quite natural. We&#xD;
saw that he was a very handsome gen-&#xD;
tleman, young and gallant-mannered,&#xD;
aid lull of life.'&#xD;
&#xD;
But, for all, I used to wonder what it&#xD;
was my mistress saw in him to make&#xD;
her cling so to his pillow, and study his&#xD;
face so earnestly, even when he lay fast&#xD;
asleep, or why she hung on every word&#xD;
he spoke, talking but little herself, yet&#xD;
full all the while of a sort of fluttering&#xD;
anxiety that made her color go and come&#xD;
like a flame, and her eyes as bright asstars,&#xD;
But, one day, I saw her when he had&#xD;
dropped to sleep (for he was still weak,&#xD;
and would doze off suddenly, even while&#xD;
others were speaking or reading to him),&#xD;
draw from her bosom the miniature of&#xD;
Mr. Adrian, and, glancing rapidly for a&#xD;
time from one to the other, put it up at&#xD;
last very suddenly, when lie roused from&#xD;
slumber, yet with a satisfied smile.&#xD;
Madam, I knew from that hour, as&#xD;
well as she did, what thought had en-&#xD;
tered her mind, but I never breathed it.&#xD;
to a soul. I had determined, long be-&#xD;
fore, never again to come between my&#xD;
mistress and, her happiness, whatever&#xD;
that might be, and, even if master Rich-&#xD;
ard had questioned me himself, I am&#xD;
sure I should have kept my resolution.&#xD;
But he did not come, just then, and I&#xD;
had no temptation to speak to any one&#xD;
but her.&#xD;
" Mistress," I said one night, not long&#xD;
after this observation, "I wonder when&#xD;
Mr. Marstyn   is  going  away?    It&#xD;
seems to me he stays a long time for&#xD;
such a stranger. I thought he was go-&#xD;
ing to Mexico to join the army ?"&#xD;
Wonder on," she said, without rais-&#xD;
ing her eyes from her breviary, "but&#xD;
take heed how you talk. Above all,&#xD;
ask me no questions, Rena. I will not&#xD;
suffer it." Then she smiled, well pleas-&#xD;
ed I saw, although her words were stern.&#xD;
" I wish he would go," I continued,&#xD;
nothing daunted," before master Richrard&#xD;
comes. I am so afraid that my vision&#xD;
will come true then-my vision of&#xD;
blood and steel."&#xD;
"Little witch ! you are a clairvoy-&#xD;
ant I believe," she said, glancing up,&#xD;
quickly, with a suppressed smile upon&#xD;
her lips. " Now, Rena, tell me true,&#xD;
what is it you suspect ?" shutting her&#xD;
book, suddenly.&#xD;
"Oh, mistress," I said, dropping the&#xD;

&#xD;
comb I held, and clasping my hands as&#xD;
I fell on my knees before her. " Re-&#xD;
member what dear master Richard said&#xD;
about your 'evil genius'-I mind his&#xD;
very words-and be done with the&#xD;
'Green Seal' serpent for ever ! Don't let&#xD;
Mr. Marstyn know that you are'Valerie."'&#xD;
"What a demure duenna I have in you,&#xD;
Rena," she said, laughing merrily ; "and&#xD;
what makes you suppose Mr. Marstyn&#xD;
would care to know? Strangely enough,&#xD;
however, I had come to the same reso-&#xD;
lution myself;. so now, get up from your&#xD;
sacrificial position-or is it penitential?&#xD;
and resume your comb, and don't tangle&#xD;
my hair in your bewilderment, nor pull&#xD;
it from sheer spite, as you sometimes&#xD;
do; and, mark me, Rena, let your own&#xD;
lips be sealed as closely as those letters&#xD;
were that used to come to me at Maure-&#xD;
pas, with their serpent signets-those&#xD;
precious letters, every word of which is&#xD;
written here, and here."&#xD;
And she laid her hand upon her heart&#xD;
and head.&#xD;
"Will you be divorced now, mistress ?"&#xD;
I asked, peeping round into her face, af-&#xD;
ter the silence of a few moments. "You&#xD;
can, if you like, Mr. Eustis said, you&#xD;
know," and I simpered outright.&#xD;
"Are you crazy, Rena? or, do you&#xD;
wish to make me so?   Little pest ! if&#xD;
you hazard another remark, either to&#xD;
me or others, I'll send you to live with&#xD;
Mrs. Francis Zavier, at Natchez, and&#xD;
make you nurse her little cross, teething&#xD;
baby. There ! I hope you will learn&#xD;
discretion from that threat. One more&#xD;
dire could hardly be conceived."&#xD;
"And what would you do without&#xD;
me, mistress ?" I questioned, saucily.&#xD;
You see how she had spoiled me, mad-&#xD;
am! She answered me with a clear,&#xD;
ringing peal of laughter, such as I had&#xD;
not heard burst from her lips since we&#xD;
had left Maurepas.&#xD;
" What, indeed ?" she asked, sadly, the&#xD;
next minute ; and she wiped tears from&#xD;
her eyes that might have flown from&#xD;
mirth. Then there was silence for a while.&#xD;
" Rena," she said, suddenly turning&#xD;
upon me gravely, " it is just possible that&#xD;
God has yet great stores of happiness&#xD;
reserved for me. I have discovered that&#xD;
&#xD;
Marstyn loves me and I love him. He&#xD;
is a widower; I know from what he&#xD;
told my mother. When she asked him&#xD;
whether she should write to his friends&#xD;
concerning his condition, he replied&#xD;
that he had none near enough to care&#xD;
for him, except two or three little chil-&#xD;
dren too young to understand matters--&#xD;
so I know that his wife is dead. It is&#xD;
probable that before many months I,&#xD;
too, shall stand free in the sight of man&#xD;
as I now am in the sight of God ; and&#xD;
then-we shall see, Rena, we shall see.&#xD;
' Oui, je verrois.' In the meantime, he&#xD;
is unacquainted with my real name.&#xD;
They call me Madame Aglae, you know,&#xD;
at my own request, and I know that my&#xD;
mother has waived his inquiries. He&#xD;
would not stoop, of course, to question&#xD;
servants, even if he had an opportunity.&#xD;
My black dress has satisfied'him of my&#xD;
widowhood, and I told him that I was&#xD;
poor. Under these circumstances, it re-&#xD;
mains to be seen what he will do. He&#xD;
has not yet asked me to be his wife,&#xD;
but I think-i think-he will before&#xD;
many days are over. Then  lhe will&#xD;
leave ' Les Boccages' for a season, Rena,&#xD;
but not to go to Mexico. Oh, no! I&#xD;
have convinced him what an iniquitous&#xD;
war it is-of aggression and intrusion,&#xD;
and he has promised me to resign his&#xD;
commission in the army. But all this&#xD;
is a profound secret, so far, Rena, and&#xD;
you arg not to tell even Aunt Molly."&#xD;
Then I promised her, kneeling down&#xD;
before her crucifix, to be silent as the&#xD;
grave, and I tried to rejoice with my&#xD;
mistress. But my heart misgave me.&#xD;
I know not how or why, but I trembled&#xD;
from the first.&#xD;
"As to Richard Zavier," she , said,&#xD;
when her toilet was completed, and&#xD;
beeutiful she looked that day in her&#xD;
white India dress and lace scarf, and&#xD;
the oleander blooms in her hair, with&#xD;
the deep flush on her cheek that made&#xD;
her splendid always when it came. " As'&#xD;
to Richard Zavier, should he dare to in-&#xD;
terfere again with my arrangements,&#xD;
whatever they may be, I will slay him&#xD;
with my own hand." .&#xD;
-And she clenched the jeweled handle&#xD;
jof that poniard, speaking through her&#xD;
&#xD;
clenched teeth, while her eyes blazed, and&#xD;
grew like stars about to shoot.&#xD;
" Oh, don't, mistress !" I cried, clasp-&#xD;
ing my hands before my eyes, and&#xD;
shrieking feebly ; " don't make such&#xD;
threats against dear master Richard 1"&#xD;
"Then let him   beware 1" she said,&#xD;
grimly; and so, she passed from her&#xD;
chamber to enter that of the man who&#xD;
was her fate.&#xD;
"Fate, Rena?   How can you sup-&#xD;
pose there was anything in an accidental&#xD;
meeting like theirs?  They had already&#xD;
proved their fate as far as that went-&#xD;
and should have been content to let&#xD;
chance alone."&#xD;
" No, madam, it was fate from first&#xD;
to last; and now that all was quiet and&#xD;
likely to remain so, the river throws him&#xD;
from its breast, you see, down at the&#xD;
feet of the- woman he had sworn to re-&#xD;
nounce. How could he help himself if&#xD;
lie loved her, not even knowing that she&#xD;
was his 'Valerie ?' and who can blame&#xD;
her if she loved him, knowing full well&#xD;
that lie was her own 'K. Adrian?' I,&#xD;
for one, madam, believe their fate was&#xD;
fixed, and there is nothing left but to&#xD;
pity them."&#xD;
And she sat for a while like some&#xD;
prophetess  carved  in  yellow  sand-&#xD;
stone.&#xD;
" She loved him," she began, shaking&#xD;
her solemn head, "as she could never&#xD;
have loved any one else-as God meant&#xD;
she should love him alone, and he wor-&#xD;
shiped her. Yet, he never asked her&#xD;
to be his wife until the very day before&#xD;
that he had fixed upon his departure.&#xD;
He was quite restored now; he had the&#xD;
perfect use of his hands, and was vigor-&#xD;
ous and joyous as a child just let loose&#xD;
for a holiday. His face was a very&#xD;
beautiful one, I thought, with clear-cut&#xD;
features and a broad white forehead,&#xD;
over which short, thick curls clustered,&#xD;
of golden brown ; and large, brilliant&#xD;
blue eyes, like a frosty sky in winter ;&#xD;
and a smile as sudden and bright as a&#xD;
burst oi sunshine at first, but cruel when&#xD;
it lingered. You recollect that smile,&#xD;
madam, for, of course you knew from&#xD;
the beginning when I mentioned his&#xD;
true name, who Mr. ffartesn was."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, yes, Rena, that was the only&#xD;
name I ever knew him by."&#xD;
My carelessness disarmed her and she&#xD;
went on. "She loved him," she re-&#xD;
peated, " and he worshiped the ground&#xD;
she walked on. I know the true signs&#xD;
of true love, even if it never came to&#xD;
me; and I knew that, in his way, Mr.&#xD;
Marstyn loved my mistress as well as&#xD;
ever Master Richard did in his; but&#xD;
their natures were different. His ways&#xD;
were far more winning, and he made&#xD;
more outward sign of feeling than my&#xD;
master Richard ever could have done,&#xD;
even if he had been a lover instead of a&#xD;
dear brother."&#xD;
It was beautiful to see how jealously&#xD;
the' quadroon guarded her master Rich-&#xD;
ard's secret-with -what reverence she&#xD;
regarded him and his honor.&#xD;
" So it went on, as I have said, until&#xD;
the last day of his tarrying at Les Boc-&#xD;
cages.&#xD;
Then he spoke out, free and full, and&#xD;
asked the consent of Madame Zavier to&#xD;
his courtship.&#xD;
" Has Aglae consented to marry you,&#xD;
Mr. Marstyn ?" asked her mother, with&#xD;
amazement, " that you appeal to me?&#xD;
She is her own mistress, you know-in&#xD;
one way being a wife separated from&#xD;
her husband by act ofrlaw ; but there&#xD;
has been no divorce-and Monsieur-"&#xD;
" Never name that name, mother, if&#xD;
you love me," said my itshtress, clasping&#xD;
her hands wildly above the lips of&#xD;
Madame Zavier. " It is sufficiently ex&#xD;
plained. You have promised me never&#xD;
to call that fatal name again in any&#xD;
connection with me. Oh, mother dear"&#xD;
-falling upon her neck-" you shall&#xD;
have all my reasons later. I shall tell&#xD;
Mr. Marstyn every thing, too, when the&#xD;
right time comes. Help me to preserve&#xD;
my little mystery now."&#xD;
"And do I understand," he asked&#xD;
gently, " that you are not a widow by&#xD;
death, but only by inclination? Ah I&#xD;
so much the better I'There will be no&#xD;
regrets to struggle against. But, yon&#xD;
say, Madame Zavier, this divorce can be&#xD;
readily obtained. Why then has it been&#xD;
deferred so long ?"&#xD;
She then explained to him the op&#xD;

position of the church, and her daugh-&#xD;
ter's determination hitherto to submit&#xD;
to its decrees.&#xD;
"But that is all over, dear mother,"&#xD;
said my mistress, eagerly. " The church&#xD;
-all else fades into nothingness com-&#xD;
pared to him," and she extended her&#xD;
hand to Mr. Marstyn, who, seizing it,&#xD;
covered it with kisses.&#xD;
" All demonstration like this must be&#xD;
deferred for a time," said my mistress,&#xD;
withdrawing her hand and blushing&#xD;
vividly. " I forgot that I am not yet&#xD;
free. Go, and-when you return I will&#xD;
receive you as my heart dictates."&#xD;
"But, Aghe, my child," Madame&#xD;
Zavier remonstrated, " this gentleman is&#xD;
but a stranger to us.  What can you&#xD;
know of him ? How is it possible this&#xD;
love can have sprung up so speedily&#xD;
between you ?"&#xD;
" Mother, mother, how long did it&#xD;
take you to learn to love my father,"&#xD;
asked my mistress, archly. She well&#xD;
knew the history of the brief courtship&#xD;
and devoted affection of her parents.&#xD;
Still, Madame Zavier seemed sad and&#xD;
uncertain. As she turned to leave the&#xD;
parlor, Mr. Marstyn said to her:&#xD;
" Madame Zavier, it is only natural&#xD;
you should feel as you do about this&#xD;
matter. You have, I know, your house&#xD;
engagements now, but come when you&#xD;
are at leisure. I will defer until then a&#xD;
confession I was about to make to your&#xD;
daughter alone. It is one due to you&#xD;
both, and involves the only mystery of&#xD;
my life, but it places us on equal ground&#xD;
at least. When that is cleared up all will&#xD;
be serene and open between us three. For&#xD;
the rest, believe me, I have not wooed&#xD;
your daughter without the ability to&#xD;
sustain and support her as becomes her&#xD;
gentle breeding. My fortune is no con-&#xD;
temptible one, Madame Zavier, let me&#xD;
assure you."&#xD;
"There are many things beyond for-&#xD;
tune, I have learned to think," she said,&#xD;
turning at the door. " Nevertheless, I&#xD;
confess I am pleased to hear that your&#xD;
means are sufficient. I will return this&#xD;
afternoon, as you propose, to penetrate&#xD;
your mystery. We shall dine in the&#xD;
interval, and Dr. Duroc is expected to&#xD;
&#xD;
join us with his wife; so it may be best&#xD;
to defer our family conference until after&#xD;
their departure."&#xD;
So saying, she departed, cold and&#xD;
mournful. She had never liked Mr.&#xD;
Marstyn, I saw from the beginning ; but&#xD;
this you know is 'often the case between&#xD;
two people of that color. It had not&#xD;
surprised me.&#xD;
"What a physiologist you would&#xD;
make, Rena !"&#xD;
" I don't know, madam, what that&#xD;
long word means-nothing evil I hope.&#xD;
I only know what my eyes and ears tell&#xD;
me. They never deceive, you know,&#xD;
when you are only a looker-on and a&#xD;
hearer. It is different, of course, when&#xD;
you come to feel."&#xD;
" To be an actor, in short, Rena."&#xD;
" I thought actors only spoke the&#xD;
words they read out of the play-books,"&#xD;
she said with a literal simplicity that&#xD;
broke out singularly ever and anon, be-&#xD;
yond all the usages of her outer life.&#xD;
It was the wisdom of her inner life.&#xD;
Explanation or\ discussion were alike&#xD;
useless if not impossible here; so I suf-&#xD;
fered her to pursue the thread of her&#xD;
story, without further interruptions.&#xD;
My mistress passed the morning, in&#xD;
the drawing-room with Mr. Marstyn and&#xD;
other company, and when Dr. Duroc&#xD;
and his wife had returned home, after&#xD;
the three o'clock dinner, that Madame&#xD;
Zavier always gave her family, the&#xD;
long April afternoon was drawing to a&#xD;
close.&#xD;
It was then that my mistress went&#xD;
with her mother to the morning parlor,&#xD;
where they sat usually when alone-a&#xD;
small room opening to the veranda,&#xD;
lined with books, though they never&#xD;
called it a library-to join Mr. Marstyn,&#xD;
and hear from him the confession he had&#xD;
promised them to make in the morning.&#xD;
I was called to bring iced water, and re-&#xD;
mained, sitting on a low stool in the cor-&#xD;
ner, without attracting observation. It&#xD;
was my habit to do this with the appro-&#xD;
val of my mistress whenever I so de-&#xD;
sired. On a sofa, so placed that one&#xD;
end was in shadow, sat Mr. Marstyn and&#xD;
MadamO Aghle; Madame Zavier occupied&#xD;
a fauteuil at a little distance, somewhat&#xD;
&#xD;
behind Mr. Marstyn, I remember, so that&#xD;
my mistress could see her face across her&#xD;
shoulder and his also, though her own&#xD;
was only to them a dark outline. They&#xD;
,faced the windows, through which the&#xD;
setting sun was streaming; but her back&#xD;
was turned to these, so as to screen her&#xD;
effectually from scrutiny.*&#xD;
Thus every change on Madame Za-&#xD;
vier's countenance was observed by my&#xD;
mistress, and these, oh, madam ! never&#xD;
have I seen grief, scorn, terror so vivid-&#xD;
ly portrayed as on that lady's face while&#xD;
Mr. Marstyn made his confession, or&#xD;
rather narrated his experience; but he&#xD;
could see nothing of this, of course,&#xD;
either on one countenance or the other,&#xD;
from the way in which he was sitting.&#xD;
And so he went on, nothing dream-&#xD;
ing, nothing suspecting, to the awful end&#xD;
-the end of all to him; but you know&#xD;
all that, perhaps, better than I can tell&#xD;
you.&#xD;
"No, ho, Rena, proceed, I know only&#xD;
the catastrophe. I ask for more. I&#xD;
would be just, even if I can not be gen-&#xD;
erous."&#xD;
The carelessness of my tone and man-&#xD;
ner had their effect. Indeed, the time&#xD;
was over when passion could have&#xD;
been awakened by this recital; but I&#xD;
earnestly desired to know facts which as&#xD;
yet I had not been able, beyond. a few&#xD;
very apparent ones, to clearly ascer-&#xD;
tain.&#xD;
I desired to learn what steps had led&#xD;
to a tragedy that had, at one time, ex-&#xD;
erted a very disastrous influence on me,&#xD;
but which I had learned to believe had&#xD;
in the end infinitely improved the pur-&#xD;
pose of my destiny.&#xD;
"Go on, Rena," I said, "let me hear&#xD;
what Mr. Marstyn had to say for himself&#xD;
on this occasion ; lie must have been&#xD;
very ingenious to be able to set up any&#xD;
defense against his past ill- conduct-&#xD;
that is, if le frankly acknowledged every&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
"rMadam, you shall hear all of what&#xD;
Mr. Marstyn told my mistress ; I can&#xD;
* Again in this place I must -apoo'ze for de-&#xD;
parin so widely from Rena's styleof narrative,&#xD;
whca can not always confine myself to, or even&#xD;
recall, though occasionally it returns vividly to&#xD;
mny mind.&#xD;
&#xD;
never forget one word of that recital.&#xD;
You see it was printed on my brain&#xD;
with fire, as people make likenesses&#xD;
now, with only the sun to help them--&#xD;
stamped in a moment,but like to last a&#xD;
life-time."&#xD;
"Photographed, Rena. I understand&#xD;
you; the simile is good. I have receiv-&#xD;
ed electric impressions, myself, in the&#xD;
same way sometimes, yet with every de-&#xD;
tail perfect."&#xD;
" My mystery is simply this," said Mr.&#xD;
Marstyn. " Yet it is strangely coinci-&#xD;
dental with that of. Madame Aglhle&#xD;
whose second name I shall demand pre-&#xD;
sently, in return for my own confidence.&#xD;
I, too, am a widower with a living wife.&#xD;
I, too, am entitled to a divorce, I am&#xD;
assured by my attorneys, which the courts&#xD;
are ready to grant me at any moment&#xD;
on the plea of cruel desertion. Three&#xD;
years ago my wife left my bed and board&#xD;
without sufficient reason, and withdrew&#xD;
her children from my roof. I returned&#xD;
fr6m a journey to find my home deso-&#xD;
late, my family flown!l Remonstrance,&#xD;
explanation, were of no avail. My wife&#xD;
obstinately refused to hear me or to re-&#xD;
turn to me, having found shelter in&#xD;
her father's house in a neighboring State.&#xD;
Yet she claims. no divorce herself, and&#xD;
is content to wear her marriage yoke to&#xD;
the grave, and let me go free."&#xD;
" That is because she still loves you,&#xD;
Mr. Marstyn," said my mistress, eagerly.&#xD;
" Your wife is a true woman, no doubt;&#xD;
but what was your offending ?"     s&#xD;
" No, it is herself she loves, not me,"&#xD;
said Mr. Marstyn. "She worships ex-&#xD;
pediency and propriety, and ignores her&#xD;
husband's claims ; but I can not aver,&#xD;
truthfully, that I have ever loved her, or&#xD;
craved greatly heir affection. So that&#xD;
there is even less excuse for this behavior&#xD;
on her part from the causes she alleges,&#xD;
than if warmer relations had existed.&#xD;
A few letters, a few half-founded reports,&#xD;
were enough to shake the foundations of&#xD;
her conjugal fidelity-matters which a&#xD;
true wife would have sifted thoroughly&#xD;
before believing, and even if substantiat-&#xD;
ed would have, after a season, forgiven&#xD;
-"Will you be good enough to relate&#xD;

to us the circumstances ?" asked Madame&#xD;
Zavier, in her cold and quiet way. "You&#xD;
will not forget, I hope, Mr. Marstyn,&#xD;
that it is my daughter's welfare that is at&#xD;
stake, and which inspires this curiosity&#xD;
of interest, so to speak. It is little my&#xD;
habit to ask questions."&#xD;
" Oh, surely not," he answered, smil-&#xD;
ing.  " It was, indeed, in consideration&#xD;
of such right on your, part, Madame&#xD;
Zavier, that I resolved to include you as&#xD;
part of my audience this evening ; oth-&#xD;
erwise I should have confided my con-&#xD;
fession to the ear of Madame Aglite&#xD;
alone."&#xD;
" Perhaps this would still be best," I&#xD;
heard my mistress murmur ; but, if lie&#xD;
heard her lie took no heed, but still pur-&#xD;
sued his story. I, who sat near her,&#xD;
could hear her small foot beating upon&#xD;
the mat, and her breath coming and go-&#xD;
ing fast-her usual symptoms of impa-&#xD;
tience or dissatisfaction.&#xD;
" I shall not seek to justify my con-&#xD;
duct wholly," said Mr. Marstyn; "to&#xD;
do this would be disingenuous; but I&#xD;
deny that in the matter which gave my&#xD;
wife umbrage, there ever entered one&#xD;
thought or one feeling that could have&#xD;
offended the sternest moralist. I was&#xD;
merely what the French call 'inconse-&#xD;
quent' in my conduct of this affair ;&#xD;
you comprehend, of course, the mean-&#xD;
ing of that harmless word."&#xD;
" Oh, perfectly," said my mistress,&#xD;
sharply. " It is a very expressive one.&#xD;
But, do not linger on your way, I beg,&#xD;
or perhaps we had better forego the con-&#xD;
fessions utterly, and take every thing&#xD;
for granted. I,- for one, am entirely&#xD;
willing to do this."&#xD;
"But I am not so minded, Aglite,"&#xD;
said her mother. " Proceed, Mr. Mars-&#xD;
tyn, I beg, and constitute me your judge&#xD;
on this occasion, since my daughter re-&#xD;
fuses that office."&#xD;
" Both judge and jury, madam, if you&#xD;
please ; and I am sure you will acquit&#xD;
me," said Mr. Marstyn, frankly, "of any&#xD;
criminality of act or intention either&#xD;
against my wife or another. Still, I deem&#xD;
it right to unburden my mind before&#xD;
you both, under present circumstances.'&#xD;
I desire that the woman I love-the&#xD;
&#xD;
only woman I have ever loved, so help&#xD;
me God-should read me truly before'&#xD;
she plights me her hand. As I have&#xD;
said, I plead guilty to levity and gal-&#xD;
lantry, on the surface-.-nothing deeper.&#xD;
I call this little episode in my life the&#xD;
'Romance of the Green Seal.'   As 1&#xD;
proceed in my narrative, you will under-&#xD;
stand the source of this title, and per-&#xD;
haps smile at its absurdity. No matter,&#xD;
it will answer for a magazine article&#xD;
some day."&#xD;
I could hear my mistress breathing&#xD;
hard between her set teeth as he made&#xD;
this remark.'&#xD;
" It was in the spring of 184-," pur-&#xD;
sued Mr. Marstyn, " that I was attracted&#xD;
by some lines in a Boston paper, to&#xD;
which sheet I was a frequent contrib-&#xD;
utor, called 'My Ideal,' and signed ' Va-&#xD;
lerie.' On inquiry of the editor, I found&#xD;
that this very flimsy and fanciful pro-&#xD;
duction proceeded from a Southern cor-&#xD;
respondent, a lady who dated her letters&#xD;
'Bellegarde parish,'* Louisiana, and who&#xD;
was addressed in return by her 'nom&#xD;
de plume' simply, to the care of the&#xD;
'postmaster at Claireforte.'&#xD;
"Following an impulse that I can&#xD;
scarcely account for or justify, the whim&#xD;
of an idler, seeking to amuse himself,&#xD;
I wrote a high-flown and fantastic letter&#xD;
to Valerie, and found the oracle mute,&#xD;
as might have been expected."&#xD;
" Valerie ?" murmured Madame Za-&#xD;
vier, softly ; " are you sure that was the&#xD;
name, Mr. Marstyn ?"&#xD;
" Quite sure," replied Mr. Marstyn.&#xD;
" I then repeated the dose, and strength-&#xD;
ened it somewhat with a tincture of per-&#xD;
sonality, having laid a wager with my&#xD;
chum, young Fontaine that I would&#xD;
procure an answer ; and sure enough, it&#xD;
came this time, and I assure you that&#xD;
we had good fun out of it ! It was the&#xD;
most verdant thing! Yet, there was&#xD;
something so fresh and piquant in the&#xD;
style-so Robinson-Crusoe-ish,in short,&#xD;
if you can manage to feminize the idea-&#xD;
that I was fain to drink once more of&#xD;
this fount of livig waters, and so wrote&#xD;
again, and again, witli the same result-.&#xD;
* It need not be said that the name here 55&#xD;
signed to this parish is fictitious.&#xD;

"1A good likeness, no doubt," said my&#xD;
mistress, more calmly than I speak to&#xD;
you now, with her eyes fixed on her&#xD;
mother's face. I,,seated by her side in&#xD;
the shadow, could see her features as&#xD;
the others could not, and they were lock-.&#xD;
ed and small-a fatal sign ever with her.&#xD;
" Oh, capitalI" responded Mr. Mars-&#xD;
tyn, gaily ; " a little flattered, perhaps,&#xD;
as miniatures are apt to be, because of&#xD;
the delicacy of the handling; but I shall&#xD;
never get through at this rate, and I&#xD;
think by signs and tokens Madame Za-&#xD;
vier is growing impatient. Do I bore&#xD;
you, madam ?",-&#xD;
"Not at all, nqtsat all," said Madame&#xD;
Zavier, in a husky voice. " Let me hear&#xD;
every thing."&#xD;
" Well, every thing shall you hear ;&#xD;
for, unless I assign the reasons of my&#xD;
wife's behavior, you may think matters&#xD;
worse than they were ; and it seems&#xD;
necessary, in order to establish the truth&#xD;
of my position, that I should go into a&#xD;
few wearying details-wearying to me,&#xD;
as well as yourselves, for, sooth to say,&#xD;
&#xD;
"I began about this time to entreat&#xD;
for a real name, and for a meeting-,&#xD;
both of which were refused, with a de-&#xD;
termination that surprised me, emanating&#xD;
from such a source, for the woman was&#xD;
both weak and credulous it was evident,&#xD;
or the correspondence would never have&#xD;
existed at all. I then wrote to the post-&#xD;
master at Claireforte, making inquiries&#xD;
as to the real name and station of ' Va-&#xD;
lerie,' and received from him a most in-&#xD;
sulting letter, signed 'Richard Maurice,'&#xD;
(you have more to hear of the man pre-&#xD;
sently,) which, of course, I never noticed,&#xD;
but which gave me none of the demand-&#xD;
ed information. I contented myself,&#xD;
thereafter, with the idea that I should re-&#xD;
ceive voluntarily, some day, what seemed&#xD;
so difficult to obtain at that period, and&#xD;
you will see that I was not far wrong&#xD;
in this conjecture. By the by, in the&#xD;
ardor of my anxiety, I was foolish&#xD;
enough to send my own picture about&#xD;
this time, which I should be glad to&#xD;
have back again just now,'to place in&#xD;
another's hands. It was an exquisite&#xD;
miniature-the work of the painter In-&#xD;
man."&#xD;
&#xD;
it is a subject I dislike to revert to.&#xD;
One almost learns to hate a woman,&#xD;
even if not designing, who manages to&#xD;
throw one into such a mortifying predic-&#xD;
ament as this in which ' Valerie' placed&#xD;
me. It is almost incredible that any&#xD;
sane woman, even if a recluse, on a&#xD;
Southern plantation, as she assured me&#xD;
she was, living with i husband she could&#xD;
not love, and with no society beyond&#xD;
her slaves, should play the fool so very&#xD;
decidedly as did this poor Valerie, (or&#xD;
Mrs. Mowbray, as I have had some rea-&#xD;
son to believe she was called.) I told&#xD;
you that I bided my time to find out her&#xD;
little reservations; but, instead of these&#xD;
alone, the matter promised much more.&#xD;
A grand dinouement, conducted on the&#xD;
principles known to the melodrama and&#xD;
French romancers alone, awaited me.&#xD;
The mysteries were still preserved for a&#xD;
more momentous revelation.&#xD;
" After two years of close correspond-&#xD;
ence, I received the pleasing intelligence&#xD;
that 'Valerie' herself proposed to pay&#xD;
me a visit, and to devote the remainder&#xD;
of her life to literature, and to your un-&#xD;
worthy servant-that is, after her divorce&#xD;
should be obtained. She seemed to take&#xD;
it for granted that I was as free as that&#xD;
chartered libertine, the air, and ignored,&#xD;
altogether, the possibility of ties similar&#xD;
to her own, in my'case."&#xD;
A deep groan escaped the lips of Ma-&#xD;
dame Zavier, and she held up her hands&#xD;
appealingly to my mistress, (who never&#xD;
stirred,) and her lips moved without a&#xD;
sound, almost convulsively.&#xD;
" Go on, Mr. Marstyn," said my mis-&#xD;
tress, in a hard, dry voice. "You are&#xD;
losing time."&#xD;
" Ah, I see how it is, ladies," he re-&#xD;
marked, meekly casting his eyes down&#xD;
upon the floor ; " you both condemn&#xD;
my course, forgetting that, in faulty man,&#xD;
frivolity is not the crime it is in perfect&#xD;
woman. Frankly speaking, Madame&#xD;
Aglae, as far as I have gone, which of&#xD;
us two do you condemn most? Now&#xD;
tell me truly."&#xD;
" Oh, Valerie, of course," replied my&#xD;
mistress, with wonderful firmness. " I&#xD;
think she was the most deplorable fool&#xD;
I ever heard of in my life."&#xD;

THE " ROMANCE OF THE GREEN SEAL."'71&#xD;
&#xD;
" I knew that you would think so,&#xD;
with your lofty views of female reticence&#xD;
and virtue; but, it is charitable to sup-&#xD;
pose that folly alone was at the bottom&#xD;
of this escapade of hers. The truth is,&#xD;
she had heard that I was a man of for-&#xD;
tune ; her husband was ruined ; self-&#xD;
interest impelled her to her course, I&#xD;
can not doubt."&#xD;
" She was doubtless very mercenary,"&#xD;
said my mistress. " Not a word, moth-&#xD;
er," holding up her hands. " Let Mr.&#xD;
.Narstyn go on to the end. I want you&#xD;
to hear every thing as it occurred. If'&#xD;
you interrupt him now, he will never&#xD;
resume his relation, I am  confident.&#xD;
Remember, I, too, have some curiosity&#xD;
to hear the whole proceeding; What&#xD;
more of Valerie, then, Mr. Marstyn ?"&#xD;
" Did you know this Mrs. Mowbray ?"&#xD;
asked Mr. Marstyn, suddenly, of my&#xD;
mistress. " She was probably obscure,&#xD;
and lived, I know, at a distance from&#xD;
this region ; yet it strikes me you may&#xD;
have heard of her, from the way you&#xD;
speak."&#xD;
" Never in my life, or any one bearing&#xD;
that name," said my mistress, pointedly;&#xD;
" nor has my mother.    She has old-&#xD;
fashioned prejudices, however, to over-&#xD;
come, you will find, but in me you have&#xD;
a most disinterested and dispassionate&#xD;
hearer."&#xD;
So I perceive," said the man, stu-&#xD;
pidly. -Oh, madam, had he known my&#xD;
mistress as I knew her, he would have&#xD;
fled from her presence for ever, the mo-&#xD;
ment her voice assumed that dry and&#xD;
grating sound. Had I dared, had I&#xD;
dared, I would have warned him to pro-&#xD;
ceed no further; but it would have been&#xD;
like passing a tiger's cage when the door&#xD;
was open, to do such a thing just then&#xD;
and this 1 knew. So I sat quietly, but&#xD;
with a quaking heart and trembling&#xD;
knees. I felt like a wretch who is be-&#xD;
ing pushed to the edge of a precipice.&#xD;
" It seems very strange that Valerie&#xD;
should have determined on such a step&#xD;
without any encouragement from you,"&#xD;
said my mistress, dryly. " Did you&#xD;
never invite her to join you in Bos-&#xD;
ton ?"&#xD;
M~ yes, in a certain way-one that&#xD;
&#xD;
she should have perfectly understood, as&#xD;
'signifying nothing.' As to any idea that&#xD;
such a thing could ever come to pass,&#xD;
I entertained it no more than the belief&#xD;
that I am now standing on the brink of&#xD;
my grave. Had a bomb-shell exploded&#xD;
on my roof, it could not have shocked&#xD;
me more than the letter which reached&#xD;
me, with its peculiar seal of gold-spot-&#xD;
ted wax, (my seals were always green, I&#xD;
forgot to say, which originated the title&#xD;
of my little romance,) one fine morning&#xD;
in October. I lost no time, when I had&#xD;
regained my composure, in answering&#xD;
this very practical epistle, and, as the&#xD;
French say, going 'en avant' of the&#xD;
approaching guest. I could imagine my&#xD;
wife's consternation when Valerie-----d&#xD;
withered and passe, I have no doubt,&#xD;
(for beautiful women never need do such&#xD;
hair-brained things,) should come driving&#xD;
up, bag and baggage, to our house in&#xD;
Portland place, entreating for shelter,&#xD;
and making a grand scene when .the&#xD;
truth should be discovered. I determ-&#xD;
ined to forestall all this, as it was my&#xD;
duty to do, as well as inclination, for I&#xD;
have an English horror of scenes. So'&#xD;
I wrote to Valerie that I would join her&#xD;
at Memphis, seeing that reason was out&#xD;
of the question at such a distance, with&#xD;
a woman in her frame of mind."&#xD;
" And she joined you there ?" groaned&#xD;
Madame Zavier, covering her face with&#xD;
her hands.&#xD;
" Not so fast, my dear madam; and&#xD;
here comes in our gallant postmaster&#xD;
again, who, it seems, as luck would have&#xD;
it, was either her brother or lover, I&#xD;
never knew which. Instead of my Va-&#xD;
lerie, came Mr. Richard Maurice, with&#xD;
pistols for two, which I, having the&#xD;
choice of arms, converted to swords, and&#xD;
the end of it was, we fought, and were&#xD;
both wounded, neither of us mortally,&#xD;
however "-laughing and shrugging his&#xD;
shoulders ; " and I was saved the pain,&#xD;
ful necessity of sending Valerie home&#xD;
with a flea in her ear, to use a vulgar&#xD;
saying, most appropriate to this occasion,&#xD;
however, by this meddlesome Southerner,&#xD;
who, it seems, had intercepted her letters&#xD;
at his post-ofmce, and placed her secure-&#xD;
ly in the .custody of a jealous husband,&#xD;
&#xD;
before hastening to receive me in this&#xD;
hospitable fashion."&#xD;
"I understand it all now," groaned&#xD;
Maclame Zavier. "No need for another&#xD;
word, Aglae-"&#xD;
"Go on, Mr. Marstyn," said my mis-&#xD;
tress, sternly. " What more of Vale-&#xD;
rie's I told you my mother would&#xD;
scarcely know how to allow for aught&#xD;
that exceeds her own experiences. She&#xD;
is very old-fashioned, truly; but, she&#xD;
must contain herself to the close. It&#xD;
will soon be here."&#xD;
I heard my mistress draw   in her&#xD;
breath hard through her shut teeth,&#xD;
which she ground audibly. I put out&#xD;
my hand and touched hers, which lay&#xD;
clenched upon her knee. It was cold&#xD;
as ice ; but she did not seem to feel or&#xD;
regard my touch, so I withdrew my&#xD;
fingers, and waited for the end.&#xD;
" I have told you clearly, truly, frank-&#xD;
ly, all that I know of Valerie, dear Ma-&#xD;
dame Aglite. I never saw her, never&#xD;
heard of her more-have seldom since&#xD;
wasted a thought on her, save in con-&#xD;
nection with my domestic misfortunes.&#xD;
Some letters of hers lying loosely in my.&#xD;
desk-the last I had received among&#xD;
them, (Fontaine and I had been looking.&#xD;
them over together the day I took my&#xD;
departure for Memphis, and being hur-&#xD;
ried myself, I relied on him to bundle&#xD;
them up again-which the careless fel-&#xD;
low neglected to do,) these met my wife's&#xD;
eye, and filled her with jealous rage, a&#xD;
jealousy that had not the excuse of&#xD;
love. Fortunately I had kept no copies&#xD;
of my own letters, nor were these very&#xD;
clearly alluded to by Valerie, who, truth&#xD;
to tell, poor creature, seemed mostly in&#xD;
the clouds. My wife followed me as&#xD;
far as Louisville, I understood, heard all&#xD;
she cared to know, never prosecuting&#xD;
her inquiries far enough to be certain.&#xD;
of either my guilt or my innocence, then,&#xD;
turning on her heel, though she knew&#xD;
that I was lying wounded at Memphis,&#xD;
went back to Boston to gather up her&#xD;
children and effects and take refuge in&#xD;
her father's house in Rhode Island, be-&#xD;
fore I should return.&#xD;
"After sundry ineffectual efforts to gain&#xD;
a hearing, and induce her to return to&#xD;
&#xD;
my house, I abandoned the whole mat-&#xD;
ter as a bad job, and- reconciled myself&#xD;
to the idea of a single life. . In the&#xD;
mean time, after the lapse of two years,&#xD;
and in accordance with the laws of our&#xD;
State, which make this period of aban-&#xD;
donment a cause for divorce, I put in a&#xD;
bill of this description, which only wants&#xD;
the signature of a judge tobe effectual.&#xD;
It has been already granted in other&#xD;
quarters, and approved upon every&#xD;
known principle, no objection having&#xD;
been offered by my wife.&#xD;
" I have laid before you, my dear la-&#xD;
dies, the only error of my married life,&#xD;
and wait your verdict of honorable ac-&#xD;
quittal," said Mr. Marstyn, in conclusion.&#xD;
" The letters of Valerie, did you, ever&#xD;
return them ?" asked Madame Zavier,&#xD;
suddenly, raising her face from the&#xD;
handkerchief in which she had buried&#xD;
it, then dropping it again, unseen by&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"No, madam, I never did-my wife&#xD;
having taken possession thereof, 'vi et&#xD;
armis,' but, Ido assure you, 'Valerie'&#xD;
was not a person to care what became&#xD;
of them-a woman so lost to propriety&#xD;
as to entertain such a correspondence at&#xD;
all would scarcely be annoyed at con-&#xD;
sequences."&#xD;
"Were those letters wanting in wo-&#xD;
manhood, in modesty, that you denounce&#xD;
her thus ?" demanded my mistress, cold-&#xD;
ly. " I really have some curiosity to&#xD;
know "-hesitating, and breathing hard&#xD;
-" what you thought of those produc-&#xD;
tions."&#xD;
" Thought of them ? I can scarcely&#xD;
tell you. They were flimsy and' fanci-&#xD;
ful rather than passionate or impure&#xD;
effusions. I can not recall any very&#xD;
censurable expressions or sentiment, yet,&#xD;
the whole impression was unfavorable&#xD;
to the writer. She must have been&#xD;
either the most verdant or the most&#xD;
designing  of  women.     But, why&#xD;
dwell farther on  this  matter, dear&#xD;
Madame Aglae ?" and he strove to take&#xD;
her hand, which effort she resisted. " I&#xD;
had hoped to be exonerated, in yogir&#xD;
eyes, at least, from~ all very censurable&#xD;
conduct, as far as my wife was concern-&#xD;
ed. The rest can be but of little moment,&#xD;

as far as you 'are to be considered.&#xD;
I would not have you think, however,&#xD;
that I had been a hard or reckless hus-&#xD;
band, and for this reason alone I have&#xD;
unbosomed myself."&#xD;
He spoke in a grieved tone.&#xD;
" You have done well," said my mis-&#xD;
tress, rising, " and taught me in turn a&#xD;
lesson of sincerity."&#xD;
Oh, Aglite, is it all true, then ?"&#xD;
groaned Madame Zavier, advancing to-&#xD;
ward her daughter. " I had hoped you&#xD;
were about to deny it-every word,&#xD;
every word ! This, then, was why your&#xD;
cousin Richard went to Memphis and&#xD;
received a sword-thrust, and you have&#xD;
deceived, every one of us but him ! Oh,&#xD;
harder than all that has gone before-&#xD;
harder than widowhood, poverty, the loss&#xD;
of children, your own misfortunes, is this&#xD;
disgrace to bear. Daughter, you have&#xD;
broken my heart !"&#xD;
"My God, madam, what have I&#xD;
done ?" said Mr Marstyn, springing to&#xD;
his feet, and stretching his hands, first to&#xD;
one then the other. " Can it be possible,&#xD;
that, after all-' Valerie,' or Mrs. Mow-&#xD;
bray, is, indeed--"&#xD;
" Madame Maur(pas," interrupted my&#xD;
mistress, sternly, adding after a long and&#xD;
to me dreadful pause, in low tones:&#xD;
" Cousin Richard, you are avenged !&#xD;
Husband, I go to join you in the lowest&#xD;
depths. This man has slain my soul !&#xD;
Mother, strengthen me now, and do not&#xD;
abandon me,". and she extended her&#xD;
hands, like a child groping in the dark-&#xD;
ness, to Madame Zavier, who, cold and&#xD;
impassive, stood apart, the image of&#xD;
grief, and anger, and mortification.&#xD;
" Then, Lucifer, have it your own&#xD;
way, since God forsakes me," cried my&#xD;
mistress, and she turned with a- fierce,&#xD;
impetuous gesture toward Mr. Marstyn,&#xD;
who stood like one confounded.&#xD;
" Man, evil genius, Adrian 'Marstyn,&#xD;
fate, whatever you may be, or call your-&#xD;
self, we must part, and that eternally ;&#xD;
but first," whispering horribly, " draw&#xD;
near, that I may give you -this parting&#xD;
message from ' Valerie.' You will find&#xD;
it sweet 1"&#xD;
He came to her--the fond, infatuated&#xD;
mortal-as you may see a dizzy moth&#xD;
&#xD;
headlong approach a candle. Obeying&#xD;
an impulse of terror, I threw myself be-&#xD;
tween them, but too late to ward or&#xD;
save. The glittering steel, plunged with&#xD;
a rapid hand from its sheath, had flash-&#xD;
ed in the last gleam of sunset, and gone&#xD;
home to the heart of Mr. Adrian before&#xD;
I could interpose, and, in another mo.&#xD;
ment he had fallen dead at her feet. My&#xD;
shrieks filled the room. Madame Zavier&#xD;
too late, had recovered from her stony&#xD;
stupor. My mistress stood like a statue,&#xD;
smiling down upon her victim as lie lay.&#xD;
You see, madam, my vision had come&#xD;
to pass!&#xD;
It was a merciful interposition of&#xD;
Providence that, ten minutes later, my&#xD;
master Richard entered the parlor, hav-&#xD;
ing just left the steamer "Montrose " at&#xD;
the wood-landing. I heard it puffing&#xD;
up steam again just .before our dire&#xD;
tragedy, so there was no one to follow&#xD;
or interfere. But for his timely presence&#xD;
we might all have been niad before&#xD;
morning. As it-was, there was only one&#xD;
(but that you know already, perhaps,)&#xD;
breath after that hour, until the day she&#xD;
died, nearly two years later.&#xD;
" God mercifully shielded her, Rena.&#xD;
Truly, her provocation was great."&#xD;
" Yes, madam, in-all her madness she&#xD;
never named Mr. Adrian or M. Maurb-&#xD;
pas. She was a little child again, at&#xD;
'Les Boccages,' playing with master&#xD;
Richard, and calling him Mr. Maurice&#xD;
as she did, aunt Polly told, me, when&#xD;
they were small, and making believe to&#xD;
visit one another, like grown-up people.&#xD;
That was his middle name, madam-&#xD;
his mother's name. She was of purs&#xD;
American birth, like the mother of my&#xD;
mistress. All the Spanish blood they&#xD;
had came from the Zaviers. But, you&#xD;
see, that took the lead !"&#xD;
" Aye, Rena, I see that it asserted, it-&#xD;
self. Did your mistress recognize and&#xD;
learn to forgive her cousin ?"&#xD;
" No, madam, only in dreams of mad-&#xD;
ness. She never knew him   at all In&#xD;
presence, until the day she died-al-&#xD;
ways calling him Dr. Zavier, as though&#xD;
he were a stranger, anid, truth to tell, I&#xD;
can scarcely wonder at this-s-uch a&#xD;
&#xD;
grievous change came over him.&#xD;
had not a white hair in his head the&#xD;
she killed Mr. Adrian, (this seem&#xD;
true name to me, madam, thou&#xD;
know it was not), and he had n&#xD;
black one left when he closed her&#xD;
and laid her in her grave. But, on&#xD;
last day, as at the awful day of j&#xD;
ment, we are told, every things&#xD;
back to her, clear and true. Her&#xD;
act, after telling every one farewell,&#xD;
just before taking extreme unction,&#xD;
to burn her sandalwood box, wit]&#xD;
its contents, or rather cause it t&#xD;
burned on the hearth of her chan&#xD;
before her own eyes. Her own mo&#xD;
had never read those letters, for I&#xD;
them away from every one, and w&#xD;
she asked for them, at last, they&#xD;
ready for her hand. For this she ble&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Is your master Richard living, R&#xD;
and did lie ever marry ?" I asked, d&#xD;
ing away a tear.&#xD;
" No, madam; he, too, is dead.&#xD;
lived as long as he could for his sis&#xD;
sake, but the struggle could not&#xD;
His proud heart was broken with&#xD;
idol, for you see he had set great s&#xD;
by my mistress in every way. She&#xD;
the pride of his life."&#xD;
"I see, I see, Rena. Truly, lie&#xD;
ited a better fate-a noble man, as&#xD;
night have been the man she slew.'&#xD;
&#xD;
He   groaned at the bitterness of my retro-&#xD;
day  spections, then inquired again,&#xD;
s his    " And Madame Zavier, Rena-how&#xD;
gh I   did she bear this blow? and what be-&#xD;
ot a  came of her ?"&#xD;
eyes    " She lives where she lived  then,&#xD;
that  madam-at Les Boccages-surrounded&#xD;
udg.  by her sons and their children, and hap-&#xD;
came   py again, I believe, as she deserves to&#xD;
r last be. She was one who could rise up&#xD;
and  from  any affliction, after the time of&#xD;
was   trouble was over. But she did her duty&#xD;
i all by my mistress right motherly, and help-&#xD;
o be   ed me nurse her night and day, until she&#xD;

)ther    The woman wept for a time, silently,&#xD;
hid  yet almost convulsively; then, looking&#xD;
when  up again, asked the question which I&#xD;
were  had long before promised her to answer&#xD;
3ssed  before we parted:&#xD;
" And now tell me, madam, as you&#xD;
ena?  agreed to do when I began-what in-&#xD;

should so desire to hear his story?&#xD;
He   Might you have been his wife, sister, or&#xD;
ters' any of his kin-in-law, since you have a&#xD;
last. husband of your own, and have assured&#xD;
his  me that no drop of your blood flowed&#xD;

was     I answered very quietly, (for my hus-&#xD;
band's step was on the stairs-the hus-&#xD;

also  the wild passion of that earlier dream),&#xD;
I     "I was his wife, Rena."&#xD;
