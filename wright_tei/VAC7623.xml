CHAPTER I.'&#xD;
TH, PZDDLER AND HIS BOUND PACK.&#xD;
Down in the regionHbf .the Forked Deer ;&#xD;
sown among the swatips and bottom-lands;&#xD;
down among the rivers and bayous ; down&#xD;
among the squatters, at the commencement of&#xD;
the American difficulties, stood a. comfortable&#xD;
frame-house, owned and occupied by a, worthy&#xD;
family of the name of Crosby. It is not essen-&#xD;
tal to the 'interest of our story to he very def-&#xD;
inite respecting the locality' It is 'enough to&#xD;
state, that it was a country of bad- roads and&#xD;
"werse'eociety, where there were more squatters&#xD;
than schools, more soil than was cultivated,&#xD;
'more freedom than refinement, and where per-&#xD;
sonal differences were too often settled by the&#xD;
ever-convenient steel-&#xD;
Mr. Crosby, although past the age of military&#xD;
service, was impressed into, the- confederate,&#xD;
Aimy during the first months' of conscription,&#xD;
anddragged from home and 'its peaceful pur-&#xD;
suits. A promising son of twenty soon after&#xD;
shated'the same hard fortune. Mrs. Crosby and&#xD;
her daughter, Rachel, Were left, solitary 'and sad,,&#xD;
by the desolated hearti-stone. The -fact that&#xD;
they had nosympathy with the insurrectionary'&#xD;
mbvemeit,greatly aggravated the circumstances&#xD;
of the case.&#xD;
The Crosbys were Federalists in feeling, and&#xD;
prayed daily for the sucdes of the Union arms;&#xD;
but were forced to many shifts for' the mere&#xD;
matter of safety. Notwithstanding-the blame-&#xD;
lessness-and circumspection of their lives, their&#xD;
names were' placed on the black list, among&#xD;
those suspected of 'constitutional loyalty. -In&#xD;
the district of the Forked Deer, it was a crime&#xD;
to be true tothe unity of the Republic.&#xD;
In -process of time, the elder Crosby, wound-&#xD;
ed in limb and bankrupt in health, was discharg-,&#xD;
ed from his 'hated bondage, and returned home,&#xD;
another victory of Southern tyranny.  The&#xD;
wound that was deepest, however, was within ;&#xD;
and during the weary hours of confinement,&#xD;
&#xD;
Crosby could think only of the injustice that be&#xD;
'had suffered. It costs something to take up&#xD;
arms, even for a cause that we love ; but to be.&#xD;
made a soldier by force,oan the wrong side of&#xD;
the question, in a quarrel which we 'heartily de-&#xD;
test, is an outrage on the first principles of, hu-'&#xD;
mnan rights.&#xD;
The Crosbys were subjected to many indig-&#xD;
nitiee. The virtues of silence and patience did&#xD;
not shield them from insult and menace Being&#xD;
in better worldly-condition than ' most of their&#xD;
neighbors, and laboring under the imputations&#xD;
mentioned, they became the subjects of peculiar&#xD;
jealousy and continual watching. 'Their outgo-&#xD;
ings and incomings were strictly noted. It pres-&#xD;
ently came to be'understood by the Crosbys&#xD;
that a' surveillance' had been set upon their&#xD;
actions. In fact, the disloyal citizens of Bayou&#xD;
Bottom and Oak, Creek :had iorwed a terrible&#xD;
'cabal' against Unionists ; and at a midnight&#xD;
meeting, to which those who had the shibboleth&#xD;
repaired with the greatest privacy, a committee&#xD;
of safety thad-been appointed to fe'rret out and&#xD;
bring to grief all those'who  resurned to differ&#xD;
with them  in sentiment.' This inquisitorial&#xD;
junta became, as' might have been expected, a&#xD;
scourge to the loyal portion of the community.&#xD;
Although these spies 'were known to infest the&#xD;
place, whom they were could only be guessed&#xD;
at, Isave : by those who' had appointed them to&#xD;
this in*idious work.'&#xD;
The Crosbys suspected some of their nearest&#xD;
neighbors of belonging to this band of perseen-&#xD;
tors, 'and their lives were rendered miserable by&#xD;
constant -'apprehension.- This misnamed eum-&#xD;
woittee of safety was really a committee of dag-&#xD;
ger,.,and in various- artful disguises they had&#xD;
taken peaceful .citizens from their beds and&#xD;
hanged them.&#xD;
On the, edge of a forest, on what was called&#xD;
the River Road, the b'es of two Unionists,&#xD;
suspended from a h eko  tree, swung long in&#xD;
the wind. So callous was the Confederate mind,&#xD;

4 THE RQU&#xD;
that even women passed these mournful objects&#xD;
without a shiver of horror,.or a pulse of pity.&#xD;
the rei n of terror was in the country of th6e&#xD;
Forlie eer. Tennessee Was given up to the&#xD;
butqj'instincts of nien.&#xD;
"Mrs. Crosby talked much of her conscript&#xD;
son. She was miserably downcast, and worried&#xD;
with forebodings. She feared that Philip would&#xD;
not be patient ; that his. proud- and fearless&#xD;
spirit would rebel against usurped authority ;&#xD;
that some fiery word would escape him; or&#xD;
that he would desert from the Rebel ranks. - It&#xD;
may be imagined inwhat anxietyshexpassed her&#xD;
days.v&#xD;
On a dark night; in the early par't'of the&#xD;
summer of 1861, a gentle rapping at the door&#xD;
drew the attention of the Crosby family. The&#xD;
household consisted of Mr. Crosby, his wife, and'&#xD;
their daughter, Rachel. On that evening there&#xD;
happened to be with them a girl by the name&#xD;
of Margaret Shore ; whose first name had been&#xD;
university, and by common consent, abblrvii&#xD;
ted'to deg.&#xD;
Meg Shore was not an ordinary person, and&#xD;
we shelf havemuch to say of her at the proper&#xD;
ime and place. She was just sixteen, and 4s&#xD;
wild ant unmanageable as an unbroken filly.&#xD;
She was akin to the Crosbys; and notwithstand.&#xD;
ing her hoydenish habits and.elfish, ways, ihich&#xD;
rendered her the talk of the town, Rachel liked&#xD;
tier, and in those lonely days was glad of her&#xD;
company.     a&#xD;
On hearing the knocking,- Mr. Crosby laid&#xD;
iown his newspaper, while mother and daughter&#xD;
Zlanced at each other neryonaly. A sudden&#xD;
fear fell upon all but Meg Shore;i to her :tha&#xD;
emotion was almost unknown, She could face&#xD;
any danger without shrinking or trembling, and&#xD;
peril but served to call out the dauntless quall-&#xD;
ies of her mind. While the Crosbys were,,&#xD;
looking at each other apprehensively,Meg arose&#xD;
too enthe door.    -   .     -h&#xD;
Stop !" said Mrs. Crosby. "Draw no bolt-&#xD;
kill we know who comes."&#xD;
Rap ! rap! rap! The knocker was persistent,,&#xD;
ant'theblows grew  more imperative ,The:&#xD;
matter evidently could not be put. off a  ly&#xD;
logger. Meg went boldly  to the d~oo , egsrd-&#xD;
less  Mrs. rosby's injunction. Pus figbsek&#xD;
the blt, she opened the door a little, and plac-&#xD;
ing her small, lithe person, in the space, de-&#xD;
znanded sharply:&#xD;
Who is there.;"&#xD;
For an answer, a heavy hand was laid on her'&#xD;
shoulder, she was lifted front the door and&#xD;
pushed gentlybackward,; and a uarn entered,&#xD;
with a large bundle upon his shoulders..&#xD;
"Is that the way you come into folks&#xD;
houses ?"cried Meg, not it. the least intirhidated.&#xD;
"That's the way I come in when I'm kspt!&#xD;
waiting," he answer  , grotuy. With this re-&#xD;
oider he stalked ,n the room, bending her&#xD;
eath tke weight of his burden.&#xD;

"It's one o' them cheatin' peddlers !" gnut-&#xD;
tered Meg.&#xD;
The man rolled his eyes, at her; there was&#xD;
something. dating and stttling abonti them,&#xD;
scarcely to be defined. It  as bft unlike that&#xD;
which a surly and proud mastiff might give a&#xD;
teasing cur.&#xD;
" Well, Sir?" said Crosby, rather curtly ; for&#xD;
he did not' like the-way the man come in.&#xD;
The unceremonious visitor unslung the heavy&#xD;
package of goods,' beneath which his stalwart&#xD;
person, was bent,, andcarefully played it on the&#xD;
eor.&#xD;
" Car'y'e gibe -n. better gEfting ?" he asked,&#xD;
bluntly, and with another fla-1i of his unconcili-&#xD;
ating eyes.&#xD;
" You have entered unasked, and what wel-&#xD;
come do you expect? We keep no wayside&#xD;
inn," replied Crosby, his temper considerably&#xD;
ruffled.&#xD;
" Men have a right to demand shelter wher-&#xD;
ever it- can be f und," said the hawkcr,.moving&#xD;
lia pack into'a.corne    ,.&#xD;
" these are times," ,uswered Crosby, "when&#xD;
we have also a right to be suspicious of stian-&#xD;
gers. 'Should you enter some cabins at Bayou&#xD;
Bottom as you caine into this, you wouldret.&#xD;
ceive far more dangerous greeting than I hadoe&#xD;
given."&#xD;
" There is no cabin in Tennessee that. I to&#xD;
afraid to enter. I am not a lamb, stranger11"&#xD;
lie straightened up, and exhibited six feft of al-&#xD;
titude, with broad, shoulders, fall and rounded&#xD;
ehest.&#xD;
" Certainly,. not a lamb I" returned Crosby,&#xD;
dryly.&#xD;
" An ox I" said Meg Shore, in an under-tone.&#xD;
The stranger heard her, and favored her with&#xD;
Another surly looh.&#xD;
 "A  family  f excellent manners!".he mut.&#xD;
tered. "There must be- school-houses in the&#xD;
neighborhoolJhik.    o&#xD;
" Since you are in,.sit donn," sai4 Crosby.&#xD;
"' Don't break the hpok of;your hospitalty i"&#xD;
said the rmorpse atranger.&#xD;
Rachel arose and placedl a chair for him.&#xD;
'ihng yegird!. I%,eineuber you when I&#xD;
open my pack."&#xD;
Instinctively,-every eye was turned upon the&#xD;
ack. Itpresep4d the appearance ,f a large&#xD;
undle of. tufts .tied up in a  strong piece of&#xD;
enuass, Temngting. bits of ffenale frippery&#xD;
could be seen peeping fro the.top of the pack&#xD;
under the heavy knot pf tOe four corners.&#xD;
Rachel could hardly have been a descendant&#xD;
of our venerated grandmother, who lived a short&#xD;
time in a noted garde, .had she not secretly de.&#xD;
tired to sep stha$ corpnlent; bundle utied.&#xD;
ge Shore shared the same feeling, though in a&#xD;
lesser degree, for phie reason that she hbed less to&#xD;
buy with. Truth obliges, us to say, that en&#xD;
Mrs. Crosby ha~d an; inward ,longing. efer the&#xD;
atuffas of the ungracious paddler. While she&#xD;
&#xD;
cntemplated the round pack, it naturally oc-:&#xD;
surred to her that it had been carried far, and,&#xD;
perchance had been recently borne from the:&#xD;
scenes of the Southern war. There were many,&#xD;
battle-grounds in Tennessee, and this gruff&#xD;
hawker might bring tidings from them. There&#xD;
was a hope in the heart of the mother that she&#xD;
might hear from her son Philip. It was not a&#xD;
very promising expectation, but sufficient for a&#xD;
mother to. seize upon. Preliminary to asking&#xD;
the questions that came spontaneously to her&#xD;
tongue, she took a silent survey of the stranger.&#xD;
He was a man to be noticed. He could not'&#xD;
be passed over without observation,-in any com-&#xD;
pany. He wa full of strength and muscular&#xD;
power, witho seeming to be conscious of it,&#xD;
or hearing fo it. 'With the conquering assur-&#xD;
anee of the elephant was mingled something of&#xD;
the surliness of the polar bear. He had .a re-'&#xD;
liable-reserve of physical force. He stretched&#xD;
'out one limb and then the other, much as the&#xD;
lion does when he yawns and tries his joints.&#xD;
His face- was weather-beaten, -and- remarkable&#xD;
for its expression, much of which was borrowed&#xD;
from the eyes, which, when he looked at one,&#xD;
showed the whites in a startling manner.&#xD;
When those' optics met Mrs. Crosby's, she was&#xD;
glad to withdraw her gaze. His teeth were&#xD;
white and rather pointed, like those of earniv-&#xD;
erous animals ; while ' his beard was of' a gray-&#xD;
ish brown ; the mustache nearly-concealing his&#xD;
i*ooth. His nose was' long and straight. He&#xD;
hnid a chronic contraction of the brows. He&#xD;
k oked as if all men were .his enemies, and he&#xD;
.Atpected injury from  them. A physiognomist&#xD;
would not say tha lie was naturally evil, but he&#xD;
would suspect that he had been- soured against&#xD;
mankind. Be was not a man of coarse and&#xD;
brutal instincts by nature, for' his mouth was&#xD;
well cut, his ears small, his head delicately set&#xD;
upon a small -neck, with 'other indications of&#xD;
native refinement. -Men, like streams, do not&#xD;
always flow in the channels made for them, but&#xD;
wear new ones, and meander strangely.&#xD;
Mrs. Crosby grew afraid of him. She-knew&#xD;
that there were terrible energies' within liiin ;&#xD;
that brooding thought lived in his brain' that&#xD;
the seeial virtues -were wanting, or had died out&#xD;
by some sudden shook.&#xD;
He was in no hurry to renew the-conversa-&#xD;
tion. He '-took a leisurely survey of the room&#xD;
and its occupants. Crosby,,who was pale from&#xD;
illness, and wore his left arm in .a sling, he&#xD;
passed over with little attention ; but Rachel&#xD;
and-Meg Shore received more notice.&#xD;
" Rachel," said Mirs. Crosby, telll Dinah to-&#xD;
set food before-the stronger.'*&#xD;
"Don't let me trouble you, Madam !" an-&#xD;
swered the peddler, bending his brows a little.&#xD;
"I have fastedastnce morning, but: I sometimes&#xD;
fast days together."-&#xD;
'lie glanced - t Rachel, who 'in 'ontataily&#xD;
mt  edIaway'roin'him.&#xD;
&#xD;
"If you fasted, it wasn't from your own good&#xD;
will, I'll be sworn !" interposed Meg Shore.&#xD;
" Folks don't go hungry when they can eat."&#xD;
The hawker bowed. her the' whites of his&#xD;
eyes in the fashion which appeared characteris-&#xD;
tic of him.&#xD;
".A tawny face and a wild eye ; the witch's&#xD;
daughter !" he retorted, quietly.&#xD;
Meg's brown features flushed in-an instant.&#xD;
The hawker evidently knew where to strike.&#xD;
"If my mother is a witch, yours must be a&#xD;
dragon!' she said, as calmly as before, atltongh&#xD;
hot with resentment.&#xD;
"'I heard of you, my lady," sneered the ped-&#xD;
dler, " as soon as l touched the region of the&#xD;
Forked Deer. 'Many times has your naime been&#xD;
spoken in. my travel ; and T have yet to hear&#xD;
the first good thing concerning you. To romp&#xD;
in the woods; to climb trees ; to creep through&#xD;
hedges ; to spin street-yarns'; to mount un-,&#xD;
broken colts in the pasture, and to help teigh-&#xD;
bors and strangers plen/ifully to Impudence,&#xD;
seem to be the chief excellences of your char-&#xD;
acter. Take that for your sauciness,"&#xD;
"How 'much better that is than your good'&#xD;
opinion !" returned Meg. "If a mag with a&#xD;
face like yours should speak well of me, I&#xD;
shoold think Satan was- setting a trap for mny&#xD;
soul."&#xD;
"Hush, 'Meg, hush !" remonstrated Mrs.&#xD;
Crosby, alarmed at the girl's boldness.&#xD;
" Don't be afraid, Aunty,'till I an,"'she. an-&#xD;
swered. "Never yet have I seen .shape that I&#xD;
was seared of."&#xD;
"You have never seen your good dam on a&#xD;
broom-pole, then," said the hawker, with a&#xD;
glance at the round pack.&#xD;
"You are a slanderous cur!"' muttered.Meg.&#xD;
Good-manners should teach you better than&#xD;
'to'fling one's mother in one's face because fools&#xD;
call. her a witch."&#xD;
Meg',had placed herself directly before the&#xD;
stranger.  She drew  herself up straight and&#xD;
firm. 'Her small person was animated with&#xD;
strong feeling,*while her-expression, itensified&#xD;
with anger, had a wild and fierce beauty. She&#xD;
seemed to glow all over with emotion ; but&#xD;
when she spoke, her voice was as steadyas his.&#xD;
" It needs no wit," she added," to tell your&#xD;
fortune.  "That sun-burned neck will.soune-&#xD;
time come to the'halter. If there isn't wicked-&#xD;
ness in your looks, there was never wickeies.&#xD;
in the looks of a man. Say what you will of&#xD;
me; but don't fling a witch in my teeth."&#xD;
The owner of the ,round pack looked her over&#xD;
With soveeign calmness, and muttered:&#xD;
" A game chicken t"&#xD;
By this time Dinah had placed food on the&#xD;
table, and, without waiting for a bidding, t'e&#xD;
man drew his chair to the board and fell. to&#xD;
eating. 'Thee  hs a dert'in savageness aboit&#xD;

s.                   THE ROUND PACK.&#xD;
&#xD;
stabbed the cold joint savagely ; he slashed it&#xD;
savagely with his knife ; 'he rent the loaf sav-&#xD;
agely ; he ate and drank savagely.&#xD;
CHAPTER 1I.&#xD;
THE InOUL D PACK UNTIED.&#xD;
The persons in the room could not help&#xD;
watching him while he devoured the food.&#xD;
Two or three times during his repast, he laid&#xD;
down knife and fork, and becoming fixed in-at-&#xD;
titude, appeared to listen for some apprehended&#xD;
sound without. When lhe had finished eating,&#xD;
and wiped his beard, he arose, went to the door,&#xD;
and looked out into the darkness ; he then&#xD;
closed and bolted the door carefully. Return-&#xD;
ing to his seat, he observed to Mrs.'Crosby ,&#xD;
"You have a son in the army, Madam ?"&#xD;
The good woman dropped her work. The&#xD;
stranger had now fully aroused her interest.&#xD;
"Our son Philip ; our only sin !" she an-&#xD;
*swered, quickly. " Have you seen him.?"&#xD;
" Yes," he replied.&#xD;
"You have brought me news of him ?" said&#xD;
the woman, anxiously.&#xD;
" He's among the Confederates I" he remarked.&#xD;
"And sorely against his will," said Mrs.&#xD;
Crosby&#xD;
H's coming home soon," added the peddler.&#xD;
1     " Why did you, not tell me at first, Sir, that&#xD;
you had seen my son, and that my son is corning&#xD;
home !"exclaimed Mrs. Crosby. "Nothing in&#xD;
the house is too good for one who brings us&#xD;
tidings of Philip."&#xD;
" Peopleentertain angels unawares, Madam!"&#xD;
He shrugged his shoulders, and the sneer on-&#xD;
his lips was more marked and distrustful than&#xD;
usual.&#xD;
"He who comes from Philip is welcome,&#xD;
though he be bur a man," Mrs. Crosby replied.&#xD;
The features of the stranger looked less sinister,&#xD;
to her. She said to herself: "I thought he was&#xD;
stern ; but he is only sad." This was a flight&#xD;
of charity, for her tluff visitor was moody.&#xD;
"Make yourself comfortable, Sir, and remain,&#xD;
with us the night," she added, in a friendly tone.&#xD;
1" You are very kind, woman ; but before you&#xD;
repeat your invitation, let me inform you that&#xD;
I have no money, and that you must receive&#xD;
payment for your hospitality from my pack.&#xD;
I have various articles that women like,-and if&#xD;
you are not very particular, I can satisfy you."&#xD;
"Mrs. Crosby," interposed Meg, "does not&#xD;
keen an inn ; and if she wants any of your rags,&#xD;
sel buy 'em, and pay the money, as she can&#xD;
well afford."&#xD;
"Be quiet, you panther! or, I should more&#xD;
properly say, you wild-cat. You can no more&#xD;
keep still than Granny Shore herself on nights&#xD;
when there are witch-dances," was the ready&#xD;
answer to Meg's interference.&#xD;
" One always knows where you will bring up,"&#xD;
murmured the girl, turning her back on the&#xD;
peddler, and approaching the round pack.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ROUND PACK.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Don't be hanging round that !" said the&#xD;
man. " I shall miss something soon.'.   .&#xD;
"There's notoing one would take in this heap&#xD;
of rubbish," answered Meg.   "You'd better&#xD;
put it out of the room, and out of doors ; for&#xD;
it is much in the way. One of two things must&#xD;
be doge : you or it must move."&#xD;
" Be quiet, girl !" admonished Mrs. Crosby,&#xD;
sharply. Then, to the peddler: "We take no&#xD;
compensation for a night's entertainment; and&#xD;
if you have goods that suit me, I will purchase&#xD;
of you at a fair price. What did my son say ?"&#xD;
" That he was dissatisfied with the service,&#xD;
and would not much longer submit to tyranny."&#xD;
"Poor boy !" sighed the mother.&#xD;
" All boys are that I" sneered the stranger.&#xD;
" Permit me to ask, Sir, whom you are ?"&#xD;
said Mr. Crosby, wheeling his chair so as to get&#xD;
a better, view of his guest.&#xD;
" A man !" answered he of the round pack.&#xD;
"A man generally has a name," observed tis&#xD;
other.&#xD;
"Granted. A name is a mere matter of -con,&#xD;
venience. Names are useful in stories, in hin.&#xD;
tories, and in conversations. But does a mouth-&#xD;
ful of food and an hour of shelter entitle you to&#xD;
know what I am called, and those other itexeg&#xD;
which you intend to ask? However, to e t&#xD;
short ,curiosity, to save conjecture, to spni&#xD;
doubt, I will inform you that I answer to the&#xD;
name of Giles, when softly spoken."&#xD;
He smiled, but the expression of his eyes&#xD;
gave the lie to the lips. Rachel thought ha&#xD;
looked more savage for the smile,&#xD;
" Are you a friend of my son ?" asked Crosby,&#xD;
" So far as friendship goes, I may be called&#xD;
thus ; although the word friend is something&#xD;
that I have no faith in."&#xD;
" Are you free to go and some within the lines&#xD;
of the.Confederate Army ?"&#xD;
" I go and come within the lines of the Coon-&#xD;
federate Army," answered Giles, evasively.&#xD;
"You were speaking of my son, P~iilip,"&#xD;
said Crosby, nervously.&#xD;
" He said he should desert," replied Giles,&#xD;
" Heaven forbid !" cried Mrs. Crosby, " unless&#xD;
the chance of escape should be unquestionable !"&#xD;
" The chances are very small indeed. Should&#xD;
he try it, you will in due time hear of the exe-&#xD;
cution of a deserter. His anti-confederate feel.&#xD;
ings are well known in his regiment.'!&#xD;
There was not a particle of sympathy in his&#xD;
voice, and he eyed the good woman while he&#xD;
was speaking.&#xD;
wa My on, Sir, is prudent as well as brave,"&#xD;
remarked the father, uneasily.&#xD;
Mrs. Crosby, whose eyes had been growing&#xD;
watery for the last few minutes, now averted her&#xD;
head. She could not repress her fears and emo-&#xD;
tions' She knew the impetuous character of.&#xD;
Philip Crosby. True, he was but a youth; iut&#xD;
a youth of spirit and loyalty, not. likely to&#xD;
endure long the restraints of an ungenial serv-,&#xD;
&#xD;
"(&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
lee. She felt herself an unhappy mother. She,&#xD;
wept silently, as many mothers wept in the&#xD;
fatal years of sixty-one and two.,&#xD;
"I perceive," said Giles, "that these girls are&#xD;
looking, greedily at. my pack, and I suppose I&#xD;
must gratify their curiosity."&#xD;
Both Rachel and Meg Shore were regarding&#xD;
the great bundle, with observable eagerness,&#xD;
Meg had just' approached her lips to Rachel's&#xD;
ear, and whispered:&#xD;
"aI wonder what is in it ?"&#xD;
" The uspal assortment of peddlers' wares, I&#xD;
suppose," answered Rachel, in a low tone.&#xD;
" I am doubtful about that," said Meg. "I&#xD;
rather think ,it's full of ammunition and such&#xD;
like." Meg stopped suddenly, andwas staring at&#xD;
the pack with dilated eyes when Giles made allu-&#xD;
Ision to their inquisitiveness.&#xD;
Meg whispered again to her friend. She said:&#xD;
A " I'll vow and swear that 1 saw it move t"&#xD;
Rachel laughed and started a little. Girls&#xD;
have the happy faculty of being amused and&#xD;
terrified at the same time. It is common for a&#xD;
girl to scream with affright, and then imme-&#xD;
diately laugh with delight. This is probably&#xD;
because the girl-adjustment is so complicated.&#xD;
Rachel, having retreated one step, took two&#xD;
steps forward, to be nearer the pack.&#xD;
S"If I had my pockets crammed with money,"&#xD;
muttered Meg, "I would buy nothing of that&#xD;
evil-looking person."&#xD;
Rachel gave a little scream and caught Meg&#xD;
by the arms. The latter looked at her warningly.&#xD;
"What's the matter with those girls ?" mat-&#xD;
tered Crosby.&#xD;
By this time, Giles had approached the round&#xD;
pack for the purpose of opening it. , He paused&#xD;
and fixed his attention on the girls. A singular&#xD;
expression came over his face ; it seemed a con-&#xD;
temptuous sneer mingled with a sterner emo-&#xD;
tion. It might have been interpreted to mean :&#xD;
"I expect all manner of meanness of human&#xD;
creatures. If I had left the room a moment, no&#xD;
doubt you would have untied my pack."&#xD;
"A 'fit burden for a beast I" said Meg Shore,&#xD;
as if speaking for her own benefit.  " One&#xD;
might as well be a donkey, and done with it l"&#xD;
" A- charitable opinion, truly, Miss Wildfire.&#xD;
I once killed a doubtful animal in the woods,&#xD;
that measured fourteen feet from tip to tip, that&#xD;
had eyes like yours, with 'white carniverous&#xD;
teeth and terrible claws," answered Giles, cool-'&#xD;
ly.&#xD;
"I thank you for the figure," responded Meg,&#xD;
" for I expected a broomstiek instead of a beast.&#xD;
I didn't think it possible that you. could get&#xD;
over my mother I That creature which you&#xD;
slew was a royal brute, and not a beast of bur-&#xD;
den. If I were you, Mr. Peddler, I would carry&#xD;
a mountain on my back l Most' men would&#xD;
rather go into the Army than 'tqte a parcel big-&#xD;
ger than a cotton bale. Why n'ot be a negro&#xD;
and say no more about it?"&#xD;
&#xD;
The girl still affected to be talking to herself,&#xD;
but she was all the time scanning the pack.&#xD;
The antagonism of these two persons was re-&#xD;
markable., The contrast between them, in per-&#xD;
son, was no less notable than their difference in&#xD;
sentiment.  They were naturally opposed to&#xD;
each other. He was large and strong,, and full&#xD;
of fierce 'and bitter passions; while she was&#xD;
small in figure, girlish in shape, and without&#xD;
his brooding and sinister aspect of mind and&#xD;
feature.She was wild, and perfectly untamed;&#xD;
but she was not moody nor a hater of mankind.&#xD;
Her waywardness never took the form of real&#xD;
malice or intentional injury, but manifested it-&#xD;
self in strangefreaks and unheard-of mischief,&#xD;
which, although they won her the appellation&#xD;
of Meg Wildfire, Meg Lawless, and Meg 'be-&#xD;
witched, her eccentricities really never harmed&#xD;
anybody but herself.   There were but few&#xD;
pots of similarity between the stalwart Giles&#xD;
and the sun-browned little Meg. They were not&#xD;
unlike in the sharpness of their wit; and blaff&#xD;
as he was in repartee, he suspected he bed&#xD;
found his match in this tawny but good-looding&#xD;
hoyden.&#xD;
Meg was not all sweetness;.she had beeu&#xD;
soured by the sarcasms and unfriendly flings of&#xD;
the uncharitable of the town. She did ofwn,&#xD;
feel herself a solitary being in the world, and&#xD;
one who would never be understood. She eel-&#xD;
dom went out without coming in vexed, and&#xD;
ready to cry. In truth, she cried often, sad&#xD;
shed hot and bitter tears. But there was a nst-&#xD;
ural spring and power of resistance in Meg that&#xD;
produced reaction, spirit, and defiant laughftr.&#xD;
Of her whims and fancies she could not, of&#xD;
course, be cured. Had she been a boy, she&#xD;
would have fought her persecutors bravely; npd&#xD;
as it was, she had not been altogether. a lamb.&#xD;
Meg had but one friend beside Rachel; and&#xD;
that was Rachel's brother Philip, who, on an&#xD;
occasion when she had been insulted by the&#xD;
taunts and rudeness of a young fellow of his&#xD;
own age, threw up his cap, came forth her cham-&#xD;
pion, and fought a battle for her ; a manly serv-&#xD;
ice which she did not forget.&#xD;
"I know what the trouble is," said the ped-&#xD;
dler. "I have kept my goods too long from&#xD;
sight. I am going to undo this rare parcel of&#xD;
goods. But there ars important reasons why&#xD;
we should not be interrupted by pryig neigh-&#xD;
bors. Close that shutter, girl, -and draw that&#xD;
curtain close."'i&#xD;
Meg shook her head, but Rachel did the, bid-&#xD;
ding of Giles in a strange flutter of expectation ;&#xD;
and something more, she knew not what.&#xD;
" There is, I suppose, a rear entrance to this&#xD;
house," he continued. " See that the door is&#xD;
secured, and keep your negroes in the kitchen."&#xD;
Mrs. Crosby began to tremble with fear.&#xD;
What was this man going to do ? Why Ahis&#xD;
secrecy ? Perhaps he was going to commit a&#xD;
crime. Even her husband moved uneasily in&#xD;
&#xD;

THE ROUND PACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
s&#xD;
0&#xD;
&#xD;
The man who had brought this burden upon&#xD;
nis shoulders turned his back upon the scene,&#xD;
and gazed moodily at the embers on the hearth.&#xD;
The joy of the reunion did not seem to impart a&#xD;
ray of warmth to his cold heart.&#xD;
"Be brief," he said, by-and-by, " for there is&#xD;
danger in this."&#xD;
These words, though full of prudence, and.die-&#xD;
tated by the common sense of the man, fell&#xD;
upon the ears of all in a most unwelcome man-&#xD;
ner. The parents had had time for reflection.&#xD;
After the pleasure of meeting, came sober sec-&#xD;
ond thought. Before them stood their son,&#xD;
whom they esteemed a youthful David, in Con-&#xD;
federate uniform. Had he a right to be there,&#xD;
according to the rules of military service? This&#xD;
query chilled them.&#xD;
"If you are afraid of this boy," added Giles,&#xD;
glancing at Meg, " go out and walk down the&#xD;
road a little way toward the town, and see if&#xD;
there be any lurkers about."&#xD;
"I will !" said Meg, and was off in a moment.&#xD;
She had received little notice from Philip, but&#xD;
she remembered that he had been her champi-&#xD;
on, and ran as fast as she could. She was gone&#xD;
scarcely five minutes, when she returned breath-&#xD;
less, exclaiming:&#xD;
" Some one is coming ! Hide him ! hide&#xD;
him !"&#xD;
She bolted the street-door and placed herself&#xD;
beside it to listen. It was then that the cool&#xD;
and cynical stranger displayed his qualities. He&#xD;
at once became energetic and imperious.&#xD;
" Back to the pack 1" he cried. " Don't cling&#xD;
to him, girl!"-to Rachel. " Release him wom-&#xD;
an !" to his mother.&#xD;
He literally tore Philip away from his friends,&#xD;
and pushed him down among the stuffs.&#xD;
"fQuick ! quick I" admonished Meg Shore.'&#xD;
" He is near, and I'll swear to tihe step. If it&#xD;
isn't Benedict Watson's, its nobody."&#xD;
" The villain !" muttered Crosby, arising and&#xD;
taking his gun from the brackets. "I'll shoot&#xD;
him I"&#xD;
He cast the sling from his neck, and his&#xD;
wounded arm began to bleed ; but he gave it&#xD;
no attention. The man was becoming furious.&#xD;
Goaded by the remnmbrance of what he had suf-&#xD;
fered from first to last, since the breaking out,&#xD;
and during the progress of the Rebellion, he&#xD;
lost the mastery of himself. His gun was load-&#xD;
ed, and .he cooked it. Giles took him by the&#xD;
shoulder and shook him.&#xD;
" Be quiet, man, if you would not kill your&#xD;
son i" he said. " Put your musket in the cor-&#xD;
ner, and go back to your chair and newspa-&#xD;
per!"&#xD;
Then to Meg: 'Come here, girl, and help&#xD;
me put these stuffs around the boy. You seem&#xD;
the only-one that has any sense left,"&#xD;
Meg sprang to his aid. Her hand was steady,.&#xD;
and her motions quicker than .a juggler's.&#xD;
Crosby stood scowling, clasping his gun.&#xD;
&#xD;
lIip&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. Crosby ran forward, and embarrassed the&#xD;
labor of Giles and Meg by her flurried efforts to&#xD;
render assistance.&#xD;
" Rachel, make your mother sit down !" said&#xD;
Meg. . "We never shall do anything if we are&#xD;
not let alone. Come ; don't be useless I"&#xD;
Rachel, with some difficulty, got her mother&#xD;
away, and succeeded in calming her father.&#xD;
Meg's fingers flew nimbly. She heaped the,&#xD;
stuffs upon Philip deftly.&#xD;
There was a knocking at the door ; an inso-&#xD;
lent, overbearing knocking; which persecuted4&#xD;
people do not like to hear; which gives them&#xD;
cold chills ; which makes them shudder.&#xD;
' Philip stirred a little ; there was an avalanche-&#xD;
of stuffs ; the dry goodswere in a heap again, and&#xD;
there was nothing for it but to replace them.&#xD;
Rap I rap ! rap ! It was continuous. Crosby&#xD;
set his teeth together hard, and looked wishful-&#xD;
ly at his gun, which he had leaned against the-&#xD;
wall in a corner. He inwardly asked, "lHow&#xD;
long shall these things be ?"&#xD;
Meg's hands flew like the shuttle of a loom.&#xD;
It was wonderful bow soon the pack because&#xD;
round again. The corners of the canvass were&#xD;
drawn, they were knotted.   Giles lifted the-&#xD;
heavy parcel and placed it near the wall, in the&#xD;
obscurest part of the room. ;Ie sat down be-&#xD;
tween it and the hearth, and said :&#xD;
- " Good people, on your sense and prudemw&#xD;
depends the life of your son."&#xD;
Then to Meg : "Ask who is at the door, anal&#xD;
then admit him."&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
TM noUNriPACK, A SEEN BY BENEDICT WATRO7SN&#xD;
" Who is there 1" screamed Meg, with her&#xD;
mouth near the latch. Some one answered:&#xD;
" Open and see."&#xD;
" Go away I" said Meg.&#xD;
" I won't I" replied the voice. "6Let mue in."&#xD;
The girl pushed bank the bolt, and a man en-&#xD;
tered.&#xD;
In person he was large,.clumsy, and awkward.&#xD;
He had feet like small gunboats. He had abund-&#xD;
ance of muscle, but it was not rightly a por-&#xD;
tioned. His limbs were long between -the joints&#xD;
and without symmetry. His shoulders were&#xD;
-square, his chest flat, his neck long, and his&#xD;
head hung. out of balance, always tipping one&#xD;
way or another. His hair was light-colored and&#xD;
straight,. his eyebrows sparsely grown. His&#xD;
nose, to all appearance, had a broken back; or,&#xD;
in other words, it was bulged and crooked: in&#xD;
the middle. It seemed a fitting vessel to go&#xD;
with his feet ; but, large as this feature was, it&#xD;
was more than matched by his ears, which&#xD;
flanked his face on the right and left, like over-&#xD;
grown oyster-shells. These useful appendages&#xD;
were not only exaggerated in size, but set out&#xD;
from the head in a; remarkable manner. In&#xD;
looking at them, one got the impression that&#xD;
the man was made for th6 ears, and not the eara&#xD;

me. That's what the matter is. Then, agin, I  " You can see," answered Meg. "He won't&#xD;

pack ; he stabbed it with his eyes. The lad&#xD;
must some out. Give him birth, girl!"&#xD;
Meg's small supple fingers struggled some&#xD;
time with the great knot. She conquered it by&#xD;
and by.   Up rose a young nman; up rose a&#xD;
young man in Confederate uniform ; in thread-&#xD;
bare Confederate gray ; in false colors ; in exe-&#xD;
erable guise.. He stood before them all,'a living&#xD;
falsehood.  They had labeled him "Rebel";&#xD;
but that he was not. He was a fine youth of&#xD;
twenty, and loyal to the core. He was no walk-&#xD;
ing gentleman, but a real person, subject to all&#xD;
the common human emotions. He was plain of&#xD;
speech, and said what he "meant. He was so&#xD;
much like every-day people, that he sometimes&#xD;
slapped grammatical rules in the face, an4 even&#xD;
dropped his g's on occasions. But he was a&#xD;
good-looking dog.&#xD;
As he burst from the round pack and stood in&#xD;
the midst of the fragments, in spite of the dan-&#xD;
ger, he laughed in Meg's face,  Handsome.&#xD;
good-natured,, reckless fellows have it pretty&#xD;
much their own way with the girls ; ao he&#xD;
chuckedd Meg under the chin and kissed her,&#xD;
saying:-&#xD;
"1For your nimbleness, Meg ! It is the first&#xD;
thne I ever knew you to be useful. How you&#xD;
dii flirt the things on me, to be sure ! Well,&#xD;
there wasn't much time to lose, was there? I&#xD;
won't be swathed again in a hurry."&#xD;
"Keep your distance, Phil!  I don't want&#xD;
yaur patronizing airs or back-handed oompli-&#xD;
monts, neither," said Meg, curtly. She thought&#xD;
ha under-rated her. She was piqued by his free-&#xD;
and-easy ways, and thought, " He is conceited.&#xD;
Row I hate conceit!"&#xD;
"Mother," said Philip, '" don't be cast down.&#xD;
I'l get out of this, in ohe way or another.&#xD;
Y' h'e made up my mind to run the risk, and I&#xD;

Philip patted his mother on the arm.&#xD;
"S pose that they do shoot me-; won't that&#xD;
be better than dying in battle' under those&#xD;
abominable seven stars'? If there's anything I&#xD;
hate, it's that infernal rag ! Think of my tramp-&#xD;

My captain was 'a corn-cracker, andspeltpig&#xD;

"You must think of something else beside&#xD;
spelling pig with two g's," said his 'father.&#xD;
"We don't know what to do with you."&#xD;
" The Uonfederates '11 know, if they get hold&#xD;
of me,'t uns4ered Philip,'with a shrug.&#xD;
&#xD;
"My poor boy !" exclaimed Mrs. Crosby.&#xD;
" Light of my eyes 1"&#xD;
" A  dim light, mother," responded Philip,&#xD;
pleasantly.&#xD;
" A Northern lightI" said Meg.&#xD;
" Miss Wildfire has had a joke," returned&#xD;
Philip. " Pm afraid, however, that I never shall&#xD;
gleam on the northern hills, or paint silver pie-&#xD;
tures on the northern snows. I wish I were&#xD;
within the Federal lines."&#xD;
The young man sighed.&#xD;
" Why did you not escape to the Federal&#xD;
pickets, instead of coining here ?" moaned his&#xD;
mother, rocking her body to, and fro. "You&#xD;
havelost precious time. My eon Philip ! My&#xD;
only son!"&#xD;
" I wanted to see how father was, and to look&#xD;
upon you and Rachel again. In great battles&#xD;
I've noticed that a great many young fellows&#xD;
have been killed; and if a young fellow be&#xD;
killed, he cannot very well come back to see&#xD;
his friends ; so I thought I would forestall such&#xD;
an accident.'&#xD;
r" Come !" interposed Giles, scowling. "Hew&#xD;
much more of your time are you going to dawdle&#xD;
away ?"&#xD;
"You savage giant I" cried Philip. "I owe&#xD;
you my life ;- pro-mote me, if I don't !"&#xD;
" I shan't owe you mine, if we stay here much&#xD;
longer, because I, suppose I'm vulnerable to&#xD;
musket-balls!" grumbled Giles.&#xD;
" Tell me what to do, Giles, and I'll do it."&#xD;
"Button up your coat, and let's start; or,&#xD;
what is better, change your clothes, if you've&#xD;
got a citizen's suit. There's nothing'for it but&#xD;
to lead a miserable life in the woods, huntedby&#xD;
all the traitors of Davy Crockett's district, till&#xD;
we can find our way to the Federal lines."&#xD;
" I'm afraid of that plan," said Crosby, shak-&#xD;
ing his head. "Some. :f our good neighbors&#xD;
are watching the house, before thistime. If you&#xD;
could get to the river without being seen, there&#xD;
would' be a tolerable chance."&#xD;
"The fords are guarded," replied Giles, mu-&#xD;
singly. ',Youhaveia Committee of Safety here,&#xD;
haven't you ?"&#xD;
" An organization thus called ; a secret band&#xD;
of murderers, in reality. It is this vigilanee&#xD;
clan that makes the town more dangerous than&#xD;
Paiis was in the Reign of Terror. There are&#xD;
but few of these secret. agents at Bayou Bot-&#xD;
tom, but they pre full of guile and mischief."&#xD;
"There'll be no need of doing anything, if&#xD;
you stand talking in this fashion," said Dreg, de.&#xD;
cisively. ' en Wetrons won't..let the grass&#xD;
grow under his feet. lHe has but a mile to run&#xD;
to get saompsoldiers; and, if the soldiers are not&#xD;
in barracks, he twill have JJerry Pickett, Jones&#xD;
Thorne, and Aaron Furness, out of their beds,&#xD;
and armed to the teeth."&#xD;
"In my opinion,' observed Criosby, "those&#xD;

" God forbid I" said Giles, dryly.&#xD;
Philip would have smiled, even had he seen&#xD;
a Confederate bayonet coming through the win-&#xD;
dow.&#xD;
"Giles is a womawhater," he said.&#xD;
Infinitely' relieved, Rachel delivered herself&#xD;
Into the hands of Meg Shore. She was flexed ;&#xD;
she was swathed ; she was compressed ; she was&#xD;
plated with goods like an iron-clad. .Notwith-&#xD;
standing terror and nerve-trial, there was girl-&#xD;
giggle in and around the pack.&#xD;
"Tell me what is to happen to 'ne I" asked&#xD;
Rachel.&#xD;
" The One that made you only knows !" an-&#xD;
swered Meg. " You will be carried off for your&#xD;
brother,'and perhaps killed. You won't mind&#xD;
that, you know, for Philip."&#xD;
"If yow are discovered," said Giles, "You&#xD;
must'personate your brother, and go *ith those&#xD;
who arrestyou. Gain all the time you can, and&#xD;
out with the truth when it cones to extremity.&#xD;
I will prevent them from injuring you while in&#xD;
the pack. Should it be passed over without&#xD;
search.-".&#xD;
" It won't be," interrupted Meg.&#xD;
"In case it should, all will be well," added&#xD;
Giles.&#xD;
" If it should not?" queried Philip, looking&#xD;
at his tried with anxiety.&#xD;
" It will fare the worse with the peddler who&#xD;
brought the pack," answered Giles, tranquilly.&#xD;
The pack was completed in silence. A knot&#xD;
was knotted over Rachel's head. It was a quiet&#xD;
and orderly pack. It was plunip and round.&#xD;
From appearances it protnised imeh; there was&#xD;
mu ch in it. There were young men at Bayou&#xD;
Bo om who would gladly have eatried that&#xD;
pack for it. Purchasers might have been found&#xD;
in numbers, for Rueel Crosby was a belle.&#xD;
"Does yopr heart misgive you,'sister Ra-&#xD;
chel ?" asked Philip. when he had played he had&#xD;
placed the pack carefully in a corner.&#xD;
" I'm in a flutter, but I'm not much afraid."&#xD;
"If you are suffering, if' yo  tremble, if you&#xD;
are disturbed with f'rebodirgs, give it tip. I do&#xD;
not wish you to etucify your feelings for ine.&#xD;
There is reason is all things."&#xD;
Philip spoke very kindly and tenderly, and&#xD;
with his mouth as neir Radbeas he could get it.&#xD;
" Do not think of me, Philip. I' am more&#xD;
resolute than ever. I-ani not ueonifortable. I&#xD;
shall not be smothered, for they have left A nice&#xD;
breathing-place. Have faith, andsee' hoW cour&#xD;

"I kiss the top of your head," said'Philip,&#xD;
pressing his lips to the knot. "-uat i repel the&#xD;

" No matter ; you Area good b'y'.God les&#xD;

&#xD;
"Now be quiet, dear. Good-bye, Rachel."&#xD;
Then to Meg:&#xD;
" What an I to do now, Miss Shore ?"&#xD;
He flirted the skirts of his gown, and walked&#xD;
around Meg with a swinging gait.&#xD;
"Do?    You would do what you are doing&#xD;
now, if you were a girl; for you are enough&#xD;
sight inore conceited than Rachel. But vanity&#xD;
is natural to man.  You fought for meonce&#xD;
otherwise I wouldn't turn my hand over for you.&#xD;
I would advise you to take Rachel's work, and&#xD;
sit down " replied MDiss Shore.&#xD;
n 1 am down," said Philip, seating himself in&#xD;
Rachel's chair, and taking up her needlework.&#xD;
"Keep your black fingers out of sight as&#xD;
much convenient," contindd Meg. "You han-&#xD;
lie that needle as if it was a market Let the&#xD;
needle alone! Boys have no wit. Let the work&#xD;
lie quiet in your' lap, and keep your pawsunder&#xD;
it."&#xD;
" Now, good people," said Giles, "try and&#xD;
appear natural.  Do not look too anxious.&#xD;
Take a thoughtful and abstracted air, worthy&#xD;
woman; and yu; Mi."Crosby, let your ntews-&#xD;
paper fall to theloor, and lean' your elbow on&#xD;
the table.  Your visitors will expect you to be&#xD;
Slinking of your eon, who has deserted. Philip,&#xD;
miind your character. It, was the mercy of&#xD;
Heaven that you are not a girl, for you would&#xD;
have put the sex in deeper disgrace. Putyoar&#xD;
feed closer together, and draw them under your&#xD;
skirts a-little more.  You are acting like an&#xD;
awkward hussy !"&#xD;
"And make a ,wider lap," observed Meg.&#xD;
"Women make a wide lap, but they keep their&#xD;
feet near together.  I saw a man in woman's&#xD;
clothes once, who betrayed himself by- a narrow&#xD;
l'ap."&#xD;
"Your wit, Miss Wildfire, holds out to lAme&#xD;
end. You are good for something besides string-&#xD;
ing'it through the fields and leaping fences.&#xD;
What are you going to do?9"&#xD;
I shall not flg up the chimney ! Don't fear&#xD;
for me. Philip, your feet are spread again."&#xD;
While Giles was giving farther instructions,&#xD;
people were hard approaching. Be caught a&#xD;
cushion from a chair,threw it upon the floor&#xD;
neau the pack, and lay down. the cushion was&#xD;
hidspillow.&#xD;
There *aI a niche between the chimney and&#xD;
the Wall. Meg drew a Chair into it, to the left&#xD;
of Philip, and seating herself, leaned her heady&#xD;
against the bricks, her' hands lying negligently&#xD;
in her lap.&#xD;

seen  Every'one of John Brant's' boys" did a&#xD;
man's work, with small persuasion and a good&#xD;
deal of driving. Brant's plantation was large,&#xD;
if not lucrative. It paid before the war, when&#xD;
Cotton was a private gentleman ; but when&#xD;
Cotton became king, like maty other kings, it&#xD;
lee tote very unprofitable. By a grand decree&#xD;
front the Rebel Prince, some of John Brant's&#xD;
bates became' brands for the burning; a pro-&#xD;
ceeding which took place during' a short ab.&#xD;
sence to a neighboring town. This aet of wan-&#xD;
ton destruction greatly exasperated him; and&#xD;
the remaining stored of the royal fibres, by far&#xD;
the greater portion of the year's crop, which&#xD;
had been saved from the flames by the inge-&#xD;
nuity of Black Jack, his favorite body-servant,&#xD;
were afterward carefu-lly watched.&#xD;
John Brant, though of Confederate proclivi-&#xD;
ties generally, swore a round oath that not an-&#xD;
other incendiary 'torch should light his planta-&#xD;
tion with. baleful fires. From forty able-bodied&#xD;
slaves he detailed a guard of ten to keep watch&#xD;
and *ard over his secret deposit of the precious&#xD;
substance, with orders to shoot down, without&#xD;
ceremony, the destroying angels of Jeff Davis&#xD;
the instant they should appear. Many were- the&#xD;
threats breathed forth by the squatters, whohad&#xD;
nothing to lose by fagot or confiscation. They&#xD;
wagged their worthless heads at John Brant.&#xD;
They muttered murderous menaces, which many&#xD;
mentiwould have feared ; but Brant was as proud&#xD;
and spirited as his own English thoroughbreds.&#xD;
He showed the whites of a wicked pair of eyes&#xD;
to caviler and corn-cracker. He erected his&#xD;
ears, and snorted defiance at united squatter-&#xD;
dom.' He cuffed his house-servants, lashed his'&#xD;
field-hands, and berated Mrs. Brant, as faith-&#xD;
fully as if nothing'-had happened.&#xD;
Brant was a man of impulse. le was apt to&#xD;
chafe in harness, and wanted nobody to play&#xD;
with his mane. He was ambitious, or at least&#xD;
had been. At the beginning of the war he had&#xD;
aspired to high command ;but the great head&#xD;
of the Confederacy had quenched his aspirations&#xD;
by, the -simple monosyllable, No. After that'&#xD;
denial he became very reckless, and very uneven&#xD;
iii his loyalty to the immortal seven-starred&#xD;
flag. Sometimes he swore by it, and sometimes&#xD;
he swore at it. It often happened that in the&#xD;
morning he was ready to bet s1 "boy" on the as-&#xD;
cendency of -the Southern Cross, and at night&#xD;
he was equally willing to wager the same on the&#xD;
Northern Star.&#xD;
To do him justice, this was after the smoke of&#xD;
&#xD;
;D PACK.&#xD;
burziing cotton began to hang, like a funeral&#xD;
pall, over the waters of the Mississippi. John&#xD;
Brant was a human avalanche, but not without&#xD;
those chivalrous qualities that are supposed to&#xD;
exist rather lavishly in Dixie.. Flashes of geoi-&#xD;
erosity gleamed through his hot and iiopetuouis&#xD;
character. He possessedone rare virtue; he&#xD;
would yield when fairly beaten, although too&#xD;
frequently with an unneeded expletive.&#xD;
Brant was what ladies call, a stylish man.&#xD;
All the belles of the Forked Deer arched their&#xD;
pretty necks, and declared him handsome.&#xD;
His easy, reckless manners rendered him a&#xD;
special favorite of ladies. He was a daring&#xD;
rider. He did not seem sensible that he had. a&#xD;
neck to. break, or limbs to endanger.. Hounds,&#xD;
hunting, and horses were his chief delights.&#xD;
Mrs. Brant was a beauty. She was elegant&#xD;
in form and sweet in temper. In her deport-&#xD;
ment she mingled dignity with soft melancholy.&#xD;
John.Brant was the whirlwind,. and she was the&#xD;
zephyr. She was highly educated, and presided&#xD;
over the household with grace and intelligence.&#xD;
She had a marvelous gift of song, and soothed&#xD;
the terrible -moods of her husband, even as&#xD;
David soothed the devil out of King Saul.&#xD;
Her skill saved more than one trembling back.&#xD;
Something was the matter with Mrs. Brant,&#xD;
however. If she knew what it was, she kept the&#xD;
secret to herself. It was observed by the slates&#xD;
that she was not a happy woman. Black Jack&#xD;
thought he knew what ailed her, . but with the&#xD;
gravest importance he assured his fellow-bond-&#xD;
men that he shouldn't be-in a hurry to tell what&#xD;
lie knew.' Jack was a privileged person, and he&#xD;
sometimes took on airs. He was oracular and&#xD;
humorous, and the authority of the kitchen and&#xD;
the table.&#xD;
"Jack," said Mr. Brant, one evening, " how&#xD;
are the horses ?"&#xD;
. They're in the bestest order, Mars'r Brant."&#xD;
" How is Dogberry ?"&#xD;
"He mighty fine !" said Jack, with satisfac-&#xD;
tion. "He's pawin' and axin' for a start.- You&#xD;
must give him a dash soon, Mars'r."&#xD;
"And Peppercorn."&#xD;
"Peppercorn am down in the mouf, she am.&#xD;

"Spitfire is all right, isn't he ?" queried&#xD;

most good-nature.&#xD;

impression her concluding words had made on&#xD;
the understanding of his man.&#xD;
"She didn't spole her name, but I.s'spect&#xD;
she meant to hit ye somewhar thereabouts," an-&#xD;
swered Jack, soothingly. "Now, Mars'r, you&#xD;
jes' let that ar kind o' thing drop jes' where&#xD;
'tis ; for there ain't no. woman in this lower&#xD;
worl' like missis."&#xD;
Brant let the horse go on.&#xD;
" You speak in that way, Jack, because Celia&#xD;
won't allow any of you boys to be hurt,"he&#xD;
said, comforted, in spite of himself, by the&#xD;
wnolesotme testimony of his poor dependent.&#xD;
"1 Ihut's something ," quotes-Jack ; ",but thar's&#xD;
more nor that. She am a messenger o' light on,&#xD;
the plantation. No spot nor blemish dar, Mars'r&#xD;
John. Loramity ! I'd sooner look for the spots&#xD;

she'll do worse things. She don't wan't you to&#xD;
help the peddler as pulled you out o' the quick&#xD;
quag at Black Swamp."&#xD;
" She gave me a disagreeable feeling, Jack;&#xD;
but it's over now. We will ride forward softly,&#xD;
and see what is up."-&#xD;
They were now within a quarter of a mile of&#xD;
Crosby's. A scarcely-perceptible outline of the&#xD;
house could be discerned, lying among ,the&#xD;
shadows of night. Some trees in the back-&#xD;
ground looked like clouds.&#xD;
"' Marsar," said Jack,."I kin see some one&#xD;
skulkin' out yon"&#xD;
"Well, ride out that way. 'There's .nothing&#xD;
there that we need be afraid of," replied Brant,&#xD;
reining his horse toward a line of bushes that&#xD;
grew along the bank of the Forked Deer.&#xD;
" I'll bet a dollar," said Jack, "' that it am one&#xD;
o' shem vig'lance chaps, that's doiWF sich a heap&#xD;
o' mischief in this yer town,"&#xD;
" Speak low !" answered Brant,. warningly.&#xD;
"Should it prove to be one of those pestilent&#xD;
creatures, we'll give him what he deserves."&#xD;
" Thar would be a halter,".said Jack, shaking&#xD;
his head. ",Like's not he'll let drive at us."&#xD;
" Let him fire, on his peril !" muttered Brant,&#xD;
putting his hand to, his breast-poeket to see if&#xD;
his weapons were safe.&#xD;
As they neared the bank, crack went a pistol,&#xD;
and a bullet whistled over John Brant's head,&#xD;
and a man was. seen running-away.&#xD;
" Stop, you villain !" cried Brant, springing&#xD;
after him  with great quickness. Spitfire was.&#xD;
up with the fugitive in a moment.&#xD;
" Who are you ?" demanded, John,. fiercely.&#xD;
"Why did you fire your pop-gun and run?&#xD;
Hold up, and let me-see your face."&#xD;
Brant seized -the man by the, shoulder, and&#xD;
turned hins round., He saw the facoof Aaron&#xD;
Furness. ,              ,&#xD;
&#xD;
23&#xD;
&#xD;
"Scoundrel. cried Brant. "What do you&#xD;
mean ?"&#xD;
" Let me alone !" said Aaron Furness. "I'm&#xD;
bar doing' my duty ; and it'll go hard, with any-&#xD;
body what interferes with me."&#xD;
" You vagabond of the wortl !" answered&#xD;
Brant, hot with resentment ; "cannot a gentle-&#xD;
man ride along of an evening, without being&#xD;
shot at by an ambushed ruffian ?"&#xD;
" I didn't know ye, Squire. Be hanged if I&#xD;
mistrusted who 'twas!" protested:Furness, be-&#xD;
ginning to quail at the anger of the planter.&#xD;
"So much' the worse ! Who but an outlaw&#xD;
would fire on travelers at random?'&#xD;
" I'm a 'Federate, and an officer," said Fur-&#xD;
ness, putting on airs. "1h b'long to the Commit-&#xD;
tee o' Safety, and it's my business to be scoutin'&#xD;
about and watchin' the Unioners. Them yer&#xD;
Crosbys are traitors, and we want. to git evidence&#xD;
ag'in 'em. Their son Phil has deserted from&#xD;
the Army, and we mistrust that he's to home.&#xD;
Not a soul can leave 'thout bein' seen, and some&#xD;
of , the Tenths Tennessee '11 soon have their&#xD;
hands on the runaway. You're a 'Feder-te,&#xD;
ain't ye, Squire Brant ?"&#xD;
"I'm 'just the opposite of whatever you may&#xD;
chance to be," answered John, with exceeding'&#xD;
contempt.&#xD;
" You allers kerried yer head over higl 1"&#xD;
grumbled Aaron Furness.&#xD;
" If I'd carried it a little higher, your bullet&#xD;
wouldn't have gone over it," answered John.&#xD;
" Come-on, you rascal!"  Brant took a firmer&#xD;
hold of Aaron's collar, and put Spitfire in mo-&#xD;
tion. The result was that Aaron couldn't make&#xD;
his heels keep up with his head'; and so they&#xD;
dragged along over the uneven 'ground. This&#xD;
was a very unpleasant way of locomotion. The&#xD;
squatter's old brogans rattled rapidly over&#xD;
sticks ; and, stones... Aaron's b6nes were well&#xD;
shaken. He cried out lustily ; he roared like&#xD;
the robustious bulls. of Bashan. But John&#xD;
Brant was not a man with a woman's heart. To&#xD;
be fired atf eans ceremonies, by such a person as&#xD;
Furness, put his aristocratic blood in a tumult.,&#xD;
Jack was in an ecstasy of exultation.' His&#xD;
white .eyes and his white:teeth shone like phos-&#xD;
phorus. He chuckled ;, he ;opened his mou' h,&#xD;
and he lifted up his laughter.. It was not loud&#xD;
and boisterous ; but itwas universal, and shook&#xD;
every muscle in his body.&#xD;
As it happened, Ann Shore's, cabin was 'not&#xD;
far off., Brant galloped to it with his prisoner,&#xD;
who glided over the ground faster than ever he&#xD;
went" before. , He was quite exhausted when.&#xD;
Spitfire stopped.&#xD;
";What ye goin' to do ?" he gasped.&#xD;
"Hang ye !" said John, resolutely.&#xD;
Aaron Furness tried to laugh, and to say&#xD;
what a good joke it was. Nobody could joke&#xD;
like Squire Brant. ' He liked jokes himself; he&#xD;
always liked them-when they didn't hurt.&#xD;
But bouncing his heels along "a hundred rode&#xD;

It was midnight when Crosby's door was&#xD;
pushed open. A sergeant and nine men enter-&#xD;
ed. They had the number "10" in metallic nu-&#xD;
merals on their caps. It was a corporal's guard&#xD;
from the Tenth Tennessee.&#xD;
l hihip was not at coward, but he could not&#xD;
look upon these intruders with calmness. He&#xD;
remembered thef" features very well, for they&#xD;
belonged to his company. Sergeant Holt was a&#xD;
Jilted lover of Rachel's, and had a grudge&#xD;
against the whole family. Philip and he had&#xD;
not been on the best of terms, partly from natu-&#xD;
ral differenees of disposition, and partly from&#xD;
is affair with his sister. The unsuccessful&#xD;
.itor rejoiced at this opportunity of revenging&#xD;
his imaginary slights.  e fancied that the pide&#xD;
of the family had prevented an allianee ; and&#xD;
he was quite willing to see their pretensions&#xD;
himbled. Philip had rather been hunted by&#xD;
any other man than Holt. He expected that&#xD;
his disguise would soon be penetrated by his&#xD;
inquisitive eyes. Rachel hadplaced a jaunty&#xD;
bead-dress, with floating rib ons, over his&#xD;
rather unfeminine head and short hair, and he&#xD;
trfied to make the frippery conceal as much of&#xD;
his face as possible. While this head-gear&#xD;
made him feel ridiculous, it compensated him&#xD;
by affording additional security.&#xD;
Int trooped the soldiers, the last one 'closing&#xD;
t   ddor with the breech of his musket, in no&#xD;
pfle manner .&#xD;
"An exemplary family!" said the Sergeant,&#xD;
tnasking his sword latter 4nits scabbard. "It&#xD;
it midnight, and not a soul inbed."&#xD;
"We have enough to think of to keep us&#xD;
wsadke',"added (.%osby. "I have been informed&#xD;
that my son Philip baa deserted."&#xD;
Crosby said this very well. It would have&#xD;
pleased the officer' better had he said it ill.&#xD;
"tCome, 'old -mans, no ' gnn I" u  ' retorted&#xD;
Ho'ts'.." Don't go to throwing dust!  I know&#xD;
what'nt about you'll find."&#xD;
He glanced at the false Rachel. She did not&#xD;
loek fasnating to him. He thought she was&#xD;
less pretty than formerly. He was glad to dig-&#xD;
euwersigus' of fading-.,&#xD;
" Den't be insolent" said Crosby, frowning.,&#xD;
,"What is your business here ?"&#xD;
"T pick up a deserter and' take him batk&#xD;
to his regiment," answered Holt, with all the'&#xD;
cutrtness oft brief authority.&#xD;
e  uare 'looking for Philip, I suspect.&#xD;
Well, search quickly and be gode. My wife&#xD;
and daughter are not used to these rough&#xD;
Seqnu."  ih&#xD;
"&amp;amp;The quicker  they become hardened to them&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
the better," replied the Sergeant, with a tri-&#xD;
umphant leer at the spurious.Rachel. " What's&#xD;
this on the floor ?" he exclaimed, giving Gilea a&#xD;
sh with his foot.  " Thought 'twas a dog.&#xD;
hound 'heddler, by all that's Jly' Get. up, you&#xD;
'Giles yawned, and arose slowly.eHaving&#xD;
arisen, he looked at Holt, and glanced at the&#xD;
sol iers., The former stepped back. It seemed&#xD;
an voluntary movement ; and -'some - of his&#xD;
fellows smiled.&#xD;
"Didn't some one push me?" asked Giles.&#xD;
&amp;amp;obody answered.&#xD;
"Something was said about a dog," he added.&#xD;
"Does any one present want a dog 2"&#xD;
His eyes wandered from   one to another.&#xD;
There was not a; man there bold enough to-say&#xD;
that he wanted a dog-such a dog as Giies.&#xD;
Sergeant Holt got his sword from between his&#xD;
legs; and drew it out of its sheath with a hostile&#xD;
flourish that came near snipping off the nose of&#xD;
a corporal, who instantly clapped his fingers to&#xD;
that organ, and looked at them to see if blood&#xD;
had been drawn. He then scowled at his lead-&#xD;
er, and prudently got out of the way.&#xD;
, "We've caught you at last'!" said the Ser-&#xD;
geant, grimly.&#xD;
" You mean that you have' overtaken me, I&#xD;
s'pose ?" replied Giles, quite unawed. "Il&#xD;
you'll take that pack on your shoulders, I'll&#xD;
overtake you in half the time."&#xD;
The peddler made a slight gesture toward&#xD;
the round pack:&#xD;
"You shall have the pleasure of toting' It&#xD;
back again," said Sergeant Holt, with a swag-&#xD;
gering ir&#xD;
g "Is that a threat !" asked Giles.&#xD;
"'Consider yourself under arrest," answered&#xD;
Holt.&#xD;
"rt what offence Y" continued Giles, hia&#xD;
shoulders seeming to grow broader, and his&#xD;
height more formidable.&#xD;
That'lI come out soon enough, I'll swear I&#xD;
However, having brought sundry things from&#xD;
your sack at a, fair price, I don't mind telling&#xD;
you that there is s4eat evidence to convict&#xD;
you of' being a Fedefal 'spy,- You are also&#xD;
accused of enticing and, aiding a private, named&#xD;
Philip' Crosby,, to leave his regin}fit."&#xD;
"It-would seem," said (ilea~ sl wly, "that I&#xD;
was more successful in enticing the brother&#xD;
than you were in enticing the sister."&#xD;
-This retort utterly upset the Sargeant.'s dig,&#xD;
nity. Ridiculeu as a weapon to which-he-was&#xD;
peculfarly sensitive. The Corporal, who 1a4&#xD;

quelled them. Hunmah ejes tame beasts.        He swiveled his sword-belt a little more, so as&#xD;
" You're unlike your motner," said one of to bring his scabbard nearly over his spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
When an officer's sword lies along his back-&#xD;
bone, there is n1t r iuch danger of his getting it&#xD;
between his knees. It is a good way to wear&#xD;
that drendol weapon. The appearance of the&#xD;
Sergeant, holding his naked blade before him,'&#xD;
with his scalbard thrown away behind him,&#xD;
presented a very imposing apec. There rc-&#xD;
uained on the minis of hisinferiors, the sttrt-&#xD;

geant., "Wit is better than walking. Some&#xD;
r eis are made for nothing ; mine' are nt'of&#xD;
the number."&#xD;
Giles at that instant gave hima dangerous&#xD;
look, and he raised the point of his sword to a,&#xD;
level' with his breast, as a military necessity.&#xD;
" I shall show you now, fellow-soldiers, the.&#xD;
benefits of a critical disposition. Corporal&#xD;
Drew, keep your bayonet well poised ot his&#xD;
waistband."&#xD;
The last remark had reference to the ped-&#xD;
ler, and was another contingency arisiiig from&#xD;
martial service.&#xD;
"Not too near !" said rGies, warnngly.-&#xD;
"Not'too near! you'll go back with a corpor-'&#xD;
al the less, if you don't have a care."&#xD;
Even the stout Corporal was awed by the&#xD;
strange ways of. the peddler.&#xD;
" Bring your pi ees to a charge, all of ye !"&#xD;
rced Holt. " This man of' the sack is a des-&#xD;
perado."            -          ..      .&#xD;
There was :a simultaneous rattling of mus-&#xD;
kets. The Confederates charged on the solita-&#xD;
ry man with marked alacrity. Their bayonets&#xD;
formed a semi-circle of glittering steel, Cor-&#xD;
poral Drew   advancing nearer than thie rust,&#xD;
Giles struck the bayonet with his hand turned&#xD;
it half around, and snatched it from the muz-&#xD;
zle. It' was done adroitly, and like one who"&#xD;
had handled arms.&#xD;
The -Corporal saw his own weapon pointed at&#xD;
his own eye, in a fashion that was quite bewil-'&#xD;
dering       .&#xD;
During  this brief action, Sergeant EHolt&#xD;
sprang past Giles, and Ihrust the point of his,&#xD;
sword into the round pack. '&#xD;
Mrs Crosby shrieked.&#xD;
Philip arose and sat down again, looking bot&#xD;
in the face.,'&#xD;
Crosby di'opped his hand in haplesss horror.-&#xD;
No sound came from the sack. As-the swvrd&#xD;
eame out of the stuffs, something descended on&#xD;
Doit's head. It1looked likeeighteen inches of'&#xD;
hiohting ; but it was the Corporal's bayonet,&#xD;
wield'ed' by the hand of the eddler. It cut&#xD;
through  the Confederate cap, through    the&#xD;
scalp, and left a re track across the'or anlf&#xD;

this fact that Gilesaowed his life; for' not a&#xD;
soltlier dared to stir in the fice of death. A&#xD;
1Sallidness actually crept upon every face.&#xD;
Crosby found himself grasping the tab e with&#xD;
one hand and the batk of his chair with the&#xD;
.other, grinding his teeth together with wrath.&#xD;
Had it not been for hia. worthy wife, he would&#xD;
have gone 'at them with his ' nakod hands, nor&#xD;

"Interfere with me at your peril 1" retorted&#xD;
Holt. "As for the insult you have airady of-&#xD;
fered me, I shall call you to account or it-in&#xD;
due time."&#xD;
$    *Anytime willseconvenient. I would ad-&#xD;
vise you, however, to' uieet me with shears ; as&#xD;
I have observed that people fight the best with&#xD;
those weapons to which they have been accus-&#xD;
tomed."&#xD;
Sergeant Hlt had been a tailor by calling,&#xD;
and on the breaking out of the war had ex-&#xD;
changed the goose for the sword ; hence John.&#xD;
Brant's thrust with the shears. It was a cruel&#xD;
stab. The man who had sat crosslegged on a&#xD;
board, could not have been. more roughly cross-&#xD;
ed by human speech, He was pressed to the&#xD;
wall. He grew white ,with anger. Gladly, in-&#xD;
deed, would h'e have immolated John Brant.&#xD;
He felt himself belittled and humiliated in the&#xD;
presence of his men. The twirlin and shaking&#xD;
were nothing to the clip of the shears. From&#xD;
that moment he hated the planter with-a dan-&#xD;
gerous hatred. He inwardly swore vengeance&#xD;
of the most summary kind.   His voice was&#xD;
husky with anger, when he said:&#xD;
"I'l report you, Sir, at head-quarters."&#xD;
-" Very well," said John Brant, coolly. " Men-&#xD;
tion the shears. As for the goose you will rep-&#xD;
r sent it very well yourself, wherever you go.&#xD;
I wish you had brought your needles with you ;&#xD;
for, in mounting Spitfire, I tore my breeches."&#xD;
It is a miserable fact that ridicule is always&#xD;
pleasing to the human mind, and the Sergeant's&#xD;
guard laughed to a man.&#xD;
"You'll go under arrest, my fine fellows, when&#xD;
we get back to quarters I" fumed the indignant&#xD;
officer.&#xD;
He swallowed down his rage sufficiently to go&#xD;
on with what was uppermost in his mind.&#xD;
."We're attending to business now, Sir," he&#xD;
said, addressing the planter. " Our little affair&#xD;
will keep. You observe that-sack, don't you?"&#xD;
"I see a parcel of goods," answered Brant.&#xD;
" It may be called pack, sack, or bundle."&#xD;
"=Well, Sir," added Holt, with, increasing hau-&#xD;
teur, "'in that pack I propose to find something&#xD;
more than the wares commonly dealt in by ped-&#xD;
lers."&#xD;
"Poor RichardI" thought Philip, who was&#xD;
seriously tempted to avow his identity.&#xD;
"Do not chalk so much around he edg. of&#xD;
your anbject, my friend.- Make a straiglit/',ut&#xD;
at the subject."&#xD;
" Mr. Brant," exclaimed the officer, setting his&#xD;
teeth hard together, "the time will come when&#xD;
you will regret these insults. If you step on a&#xD;
rattlesnake, don't complain if he bites you."&#xD;
" A goed figure," laughed Brant, " because&#xD;
&#xD;
your legs have been coiled up much of your&#xD;
life."&#xD;
" Corporal- Drew," said Holt, "untie that&#xD;
pack."&#xD;
"And cabbage nothing !" quoth Brant, grave-&#xD;
ly.&#xD;
Sergeant Holt gave the planter an annihilat-&#xD;
ing look, but which did not harm him.&#xD;
"Keep that yer man off t" answered the Cor-&#xD;
poral, with a proper regard to his safety.&#xD;
He laid his musket on the floor, and went at&#xD;
the knot, the peddler looking on calmly.&#xD;
It was an anxiou4 moment for the Crosbys.&#xD;
The safety of Philip depended on the nerves of&#xD;
Rachel.., Giles expected to see her come out of&#xD;
the sack in a dead swoon. That would tell&#xD;
badly on their plan. - He quietly made up his&#xD;
mind that nothing but steel and muscle would&#xD;
save Philip and himself So he began to make&#xD;
calculations, and to back toward the wall. He&#xD;
glanced, too, at Philip, and gave a significant&#xD;
nod to Meg, who carried Crosby's musket, and&#xD;
placed it where the young man could easily get&#xD;
it. Then she pushed her way resolutely back&#xD;
to the round pack to aid Rachel the moment&#xD;
she needed help.&#xD;
"Come out, Philip I" said Giles, when the&#xD;
canvas was unknotted.  " Come out, my boy;&#xD;
the game is up."&#xD;
Instantly the round pack lost its roundness,&#xD;
and fell into confusion. Out sprang Rachel,&#xD;
smart and dashing in her uniform, cap in hand;&#xD;
and not long in hand, either; for she clapped&#xD;
it on her head the first thing she did.&#xD;
The friends of this fictitious youth were agree-&#xD;
ably surprised. The girl gave no indications&#xD;
of shrinking.- There was not that pallor about&#xD;
the mouth which prognosticates fainting  Hav-&#xD;
ing glanced around at the parties, she retreated&#xD;
between Giles and Brant, and folding her arms,&#xD;
and dropping her chin, affected to look at the&#xD;
Confederates sullenly.&#xD;
The lights had been skillfully placed by Meg&#xD;
before the arrival of the military posse. The&#xD;
flames of the candles flared feebly on her face,&#xD;
increasing instead of detracting from its brown-&#xD;
ness. Sergeant Holt had no reason to believe&#xD;
that any other than Philip Crosby stood before&#xD;
him. His satisfaction was too apparent to be un-&#xD;
noticed. Color came back to his countenance.&#xD;
The angry expression of his lips settled into a&#xD;
smile. His character for sagacity, he thought,&#xD;
was established. Promotion loomed before him.&#xD;
Lieutenants would be leaped, probably, and a&#xD;
captaincy was the very least that he would be&#xD;
willing to accept.&#xD;
He did not put up his sword, but, like Peter,&#xD;
was ready to cut off somebody's ear. He turn-&#xD;
ed to piles, loftily, and said: -&#xD;
"Your artifice, Sir, was ingenious, but you&#xD;
must. know that there are those as skillful at&#xD;
findingtas you are at hiding.  Oprporal Drw,&#xD;

The coneluding words were spoken after Spit-&#xD;
fire was in 'motion. By the time-the door was,&#xD;
open, John Brant was rods away, and fences&#xD;
and trees Were flying past' him like winged&#xD;
shadows.&#xD;
The peddler mounted Clipper, 'whd, feeling his&#xD;
weight,;stood erect oh his 'hind feet, arching his&#xD;
neck and snorting.&#xD;
"Farewell, good fellows !" cried Giles; wav-&#xD;

'With these tantalizing words, he gave Clip-&#xD;

him.&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
ANN SHORE SPEAKS mER iaD TO CEmA.&#xD;
Celia sat, thinking of John Brant. He had&#xD;
been gone an hour. She had heard. Spitfire&#xD;
#rnd Clipper clattering away finely, and resolved&#xD;
not to retire till-the return of her reckless liege.&#xD;
11er feelings about his goinm down to Crosby's&#xD;
were contradictory  She wished him to assist&#xD;
Philip  but she had heard rumors concerning&#xD;
aell's'beauty, and John's admiration of her.&#xD;
There were a few gossips even on the banks of the&#xD;
Forked Deer; and -whatever was uncharitable&#xD;
to man or woman was peddled by them with as&#xD;
much zest as if they had lived in a populous&#xD;
town, where scandal makes a 'louder buzzing in&#xD;
the hutman-hive.&#xD;
Rachel was handsome, and John Brant was&#xD;
brave. This fancy troubled her. She tried to&#xD;
smother it, but thoughts flit through the brain&#xD;
like birds through the a-.&#xD;
While she' was thus borrowing trouble, in&#xD;
stalked Ann Shrore, with Grimkey at her heels.&#xD;
She paused upon the threshold in precisely the&#xD;
same manner that she had stopped in te road&#xD;
before Brant. Her'cane was thrust out 'before,&#xD;
her withered hands resting upon the top, while&#xD;
its lower end was braced on the floor.- Grinkey&#xD;
stood in the rear and greiwled, ereting his-ears&#xD;
and bristling-along his back.&#xD;
The woman's approach 'had been so silent and&#xD;
unexpected, that Celia was at first quite 'terri-&#xD;
fled.; nor did she immediately recover her calm-&#xD;
Hess. This wasanot her first ,meeting with Ann&#xD;
Shore, and her memories of her were not pleas-&#xD;
ant., She was too much surprised to bid her&#xD;
come in or .go out,-.a want-ofattention which&#xD;
Ann resented.'&#xD;
"You might bid one come or go,"'sho mut-&#xD;
tered.                          .&#xD;
C ome in I"said Celia, faintly..&#xD;
"A weak weleomhe, Celia ;a weak welcome I''&#xD;
said Ann, advancing. "Perhaps you-dod't like&#xD;
a witch inder your roof?"she added.&#xD;
Mlru Brant'shivered as i-e woman'drew near.&#xD;
Iam the du  light of the room, the solemn-faced&#xD;
ad faded woma    lked like i creature of&#xD;
evil.&#xD;
&#xD;
- " Why do y'ou call me C lia ?" faltered the&#xD;
niistre s of the house. . "We have not met&#xD;
often, and our acq'unintance is sligh .&#xD;
Ann Shore 'ddntracte'd her fIie,'as if she would&#xD;
draw every feature to her mouth.&#xD;
"I thank ye for that !" she, evelaimed. and&#xD;
theft stoodstock still. Her'looks *ere ominous.&#xD;
" Sit dowil!" 'said Celia, the words seeming&#xD;
to stick to her mouth.&#xD;
" I've trudged far," retoi'tedl Ann, " but I&#xD;
can stand-to say what little I have to say. John&#xD;
Brant'has gone down to Crosby's. I net himn&#xD;
on the way"&#xD;
There was a boding note in her voice. Grim-&#xD;
key made some eroeking growls in his throat.&#xD;
"The Crosbys are in trouble," Mrs. Brant&#xD;
answered.&#xD;
" And their trouble never will be less !" said&#xD;
Ann,: with emphasis.   "Their son deserted.&#xD;
Let the punishment for -desertion be meted out&#xD;
to him."&#xD;
" The Crosbys are akin to. you, I have&#xD;
'heard ?"&#xD;
"Not a whit !"' cried Ain 'Shore. 'They&#xD;
were once, but treason has cured them of thiat.&#xD;
No relation am I 'to Abolition traitoi-s !"&#xD;
A few moments of silence ensued.&#xD;
"Philip and the peddler are on their way to&#xD;
head-quarters before this time," she added, re-&#xD;
flectively, but without the 'appearance of re-&#xD;
morse. - "Your man and master rode to the&#xD;
rescue ; but too late rode he. But he will find&#xD;
Rachel, perchance. Sire may make him amends&#xD;
for 'disappointment."&#xD;
" You are a prompter of evil thoughtsI"&#xD;
responded  Mrs. -Brant, inwardly disturbed.&#xD;
"You had.better leave my house."&#xD;
"Your house, indeed ! You belong to the&#xD;
house, and not the house to you."&#xD;
Grirmkey made a stiff back at Mrs. Brant.&#xD;
The wrinkles on Ann Shore's face were rigidly&#xD;
fixed.&#xD;
"Good .woman,"'entreated Celia, "do not&#xD;
stay ; I beg of you to go."&#xD;
"Stay I will, and go I wil not! You asked&#xD;
me just now why 1 called you Celia ? It was&#xD;
wrong ,to call you'that. I should have given it&#xD;
a shorter sound,'and pronohnned it as they used&#xD;
to on the pIlantation where you were born; they&#xD;
called it.Cely. It was Cely here and Cely there.&#xD;
It is a favorite name amng the slaves "&#xD;
- ".I will 'not hear you'!" llcried Mrs Brant.&#xD;
"If you dbonot stop, I will ring and have the&#xD;
servants put you out."&#xD;
," I dtre you to ring 1" retorted Ann, shakitig&#xD;
her 'withered hand at the 'trembling woman&#xD;
before her. i "Ring, and I will proelaia before&#xD;
them all that you are a itve 1"&#xD;

" Bravely  said I"  sneered  the  woman.   Celia's'hands fell helplessly to her side. She&#xD;
" Bravely said, but falsely. John Brant is not settled back in her chair, bereft of the power of&#xD;
your husband, and you are no wife."        speech.&#xD;
" Did you come here to tell me this ?" asked  " You read, you write ; you talk French with&#xD;

&#xD;
What a country *e Shall- have when 'tailors&#xD;

came here, as well as if it wasn't but yester.&#xD;
day.' 'on wbre a spruce suit that you cut and&#xD;
made yourself.  Do you recollect your er-&#xD;

Margaret Shore made a comical face, and the&#xD;
men gave signs of enjoyitig her hits.&#xD;
"You came to see Rachel Crosby. What&#xD;
sent you, the powers of folly only know; for&#xD;
Rachel always gave you the go-by, athome and&#xD;

what it was, won't you? The Corporal would&#xD;

we should 'all like to h   Come, Sergeant,&#xD;
#hat did she gay?"&#xD;
It was not so much the words as the manner&#xD;
of their utterance that made them provoking.&#xD;
They were inimitably mouthed--with a pretty&#xD;
mouth.&#xD;
Holt said some words, not in Murray% large&#xD;
edition of Chesterfield,'and instantly gave the&#xD;
order to march. Every member of the house.&#xD;
hold felt relieved. Fervently Mrs. Crosby&#xD;
thanked the'Benevolent Powers for this deliver-&#xD;
ance. She embraced Philip tenderly, and it re-&#xD;
quired all the helpful energy of Margaret Shore&#xD;
to keep her from fainting. Philip began to feel&#xD;
a sentiment of gratitude toward this eccentric&#xD;
girl. He looked at her with more attention than&#xD;
evei before in his life.&#xD;
" Truly," thought he, "Meg might be a worse-&#xD;
looking girl,'and a worse-behaved girl, too. To&#xD;
be sure, one would hardly want to marry Meg,&#xD;
because her mother is such a witch, and she is&#xD;
such a hoyden."&#xD;
But there were now other matters to think&#xD;
of; but it is doubtful if they would have been&#xD;
attended to, without the promptings of this&#xD;
same Meg. ' To remain long there, would 'be to&#xD;
fall arain into the danger which he had just&#xD;
evaded. It was needful to throw off his dis-&#xD;
gnise, for garments to which he was accustomed.,&#xD;
t was thought best that he should not change&#xD;
his apparel at hone, as Rachel's gown and shawl&#xD;
might help him to get away unnoticed, or at&#xD;
least unquestioned, by any lurkers in the vi&#xD;
eiaity.&#xD;
Mrs. Crosby soon tade up a bundle of clothes,&#xD;
wheei considerable discussion followed about his&#xD;
destination. Margaret Shore listeiled with iin-&#xD;
patience.                           -&#xD;
"Every minute,".said she, breaking in upon&#xD;
the conversation, "is worth ever so much. Ben&#xD;
Watrous( or some of his clan, inay be lurking&#xD;
round to see what -has happened; and it would'&#xD;
be like him to come in and make trouble. The&#xD;
best thing you can do is, to start at once. The&#xD;
deception may be dlteo4ered between this and&#xD;
Paw-Paw Ford, and there is a strong probability&#xD;
that it will he after they'reach there. Well, if&#xD;
they find out that they've got Rachel instead&#xD;
&#xD;
of you, they'll be back again, and there'll ho&#xD;
such a'search here as never was before."&#xD;
The Crosbys readily agreed that this was rea-&#xD;
sonable, but they could not even guess at what&#xD;
appeared a safe place of retreat. Without a&#xD;
word more, Margaret put on her bonnet and&#xD;
shawl, tnd taking up the bundle, said :&#xD;
"Come, Phil l"&#xD;
9 What's' the girl going to do.?" he asked,&#xD;
while passively' submitting to be shawled and&#xD;
bonnetted.&#xD;
"Will you come along ?" demanded Meg,&#xD;
petulantly.  "Do you want to be carried to-&#xD;
head-quarte's and shot?"&#xD;
' Not I, Meg! !"But what good you can do&#xD;
me, I don't know. Girls don't usually like to&#xD;
go tramping about with young fellows at night."&#xD;
4 Go with Margaret, my son. She is a way-&#xD;
ward child, but not without discretion. Her&#xD;
foresight and ingenuity will be of great benefit to&#xD;
you in this strait."'&#xD;
' Im to have a she-guide, eh ?" replied 1l.-&#xD;
ip, dubiously.&#xD;
" If you go now," said Meg, sharply. " But&#xD;
if you stand shilly-shallying here much longer,&#xD;
not a step will I take to savd you from the Ser-&#xD;
geant.,,&#xD;
Margaret," said Mr. Crosby, much disturb-&#xD;
ed, " you are taking a terrible responsibility.&#xD;
But you are well acquainted with the country.&#xD;
If any person can conduct him to a hiding-&#xD;
place, I think you can. Be prudent, girl. Do&#xD;
not forget that the life of my son is intrusted to&#xD;
your hand. Oft my own part, I do gratefully&#xD;
accept Sout' offer to show him the way. If 1&#xD;
have, at any time, been over-hard on your way-&#xD;
wardness, I hope you'll forget it, and show your&#xD;
affection to our family by saving Philip.  I&#xD;
know that he and you never agreed over well,&#xD;
and that he has had many a fluig at your jiild-&#xD;
ness ; hut let your conduct to-night prove that&#xD;
you can overlook petty slights and sarcasms."&#xD;
" If Philip '11 come along, I'll do my best to&#xD;
get hims away from Ben Watrous and his spies,"&#xD;
answered Meg, promptly.&#xD;
" Well, Meg, give me the bundle," said Phil-&#xD;
ip. " You are not going to fetch and carry for&#xD;
m     Y like a mastiff. We'e not going like an Irish&#xD;
emigrant and his wife--the latter takingthe&#xD;
bundle."g&#xD;
"For appearance' sake," answered Meg, open-&#xD;
ing the door, "I must be our servant for this&#xD;
once. But I wouldn't lift my hand for you,&#xD;
Phil, if you weren't in danger."&#xD;
Philip shook hands with his father and moth-&#xD;
er. The boy felt tears dropping on his hand,&#xD;
and to hide his own emotions, said, with affected&#xD;
cheerfulness to Meg:&#xD;
" Go on, Miss Wildfire I I'm in marching or-&#xD;
der." Then he added, "Farewell, mother 1'&#xD;
and followed Margaret Shore.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
IN WHIOH IT IS SHOWN-THAT A PISTOL TO THE&#xD;
NOSE IS COLD COMFORT,&#xD;
Out went Meg and Phil into the night. Thick&#xD;
was the darkness, and low drifted the clouds.&#xD;
The course of the Forked Deer looked like a&#xD;
black thread winding along the flat bottoms.&#xD;
The rank shrubbery on the -banks, seen imper-&#xD;
fectly through the obscurity, took fantastic&#xD;
shapes. In the background of the river was a&#xD;
great bank of darkness, formed by forest and&#xD;
,ill.&#xD;
Philip's guide did not pause to deliberate,&#xD;
but struck off briskly ifi a narrow path which&#xD;
diverged gradually from the line of the stream.&#xD;
The young inah asked no questions, at first, but&#xD;
walked after her quietly. They passed in the&#xD;
rear of Ann Shore's catin, and their faces were&#xD;
toward the wooded highlands.&#xD;
,'They were making- excellent pi'ogress, when&#xD;
Meg espied some one approaching from the op-&#xD;
posite direction, and warned her companion to&#xD;
be discreet.&#xD;
" Discreet as a matron, Meg .' sld Phil.&#xD;
"It' 11 be a new thing, then; for your hot&#xD;
temper always did run away with your sense. I&#xD;
believe it is Watrous, Phil. There never was&#xD;
such a lurker . He wants to know what has hap-&#xD;
pened down at your house. He sleeps days&#xD;
and :prowls o' nights. Do keep your tongue&#xD;
still, and leave the matter of excuses to me."&#xD;
Margaret was right respecting the identity of&#xD;
the person who was coming toward them. Wat-&#xD;
1 cus, seeing two persons in his path, walked&#xD;
Mhewly till they were near enough for him to&#xD;
discover -that they were females. Being satis-&#xD;
fied-of this, he went on bravely. He manifest-&#xD;
ed considerable astonishment at meeting Rachel&#xD;
and Meg at such an unseasonable hour.&#xD;
" What's up?"4,asked Ben Watrous.  "What&#xD;
Means this yer ?"&#xD;
"We can't rtop to ansirer questions," an-&#xD;
swered Meg, "so don't block up the path."&#xD;
"Can't answer questions, eh ?" added Ben,&#xD;
taking up as much of the way as he could.&#xD;
"burned if you can't. This isn't a lovely hour&#xD;
for gals to be a promenardin'. Knock my wat-&#xD;
tles, if I don't believe you're running' away.'&#xD;
S4' Runnin' away or not, it's no concern of&#xD;
yours ." retorted Meg, as fearlessly as if she&#xD;
were sitting in Crosby's chimney-corner.&#xD;
" Dunno 'bout. that yer. I've got business&#xD;
with nigh on't everybody, now-adays. There&#xD;
ain't a busier man in the kentry. People won-&#xD;
der when I git my sleep. Whar's Phil  "&#xD;
" At John Braut's by this time, or even be-&#xD;
yond there," replied Meg, promptly.&#xD;
I" Did he git away ?" asked Watrous, eagerly.&#xD;
" He did,"replied Meg, " and in good salpe,&#xD;
too.  Y6u lost your labor that time, Ben.&#xD;
John Brant rode down to the house with his bov&#xD;
Jack, and the little tailor, with his 'nine men,&#xD;
stood ino chance at all. Out went ite peddler,&#xD;
&#xD;
and John, and Phil, and away they went on two&#xD;
thorough-breds."&#xD;
" Look here, Mg I I've seen and hearm&#xD;
much o' you, and I know the cut of your comb&#xD;
pretty well. You're a loud grower, and right&#xD;
down game ; but you're as deceptive as the&#xD;
devil;!"&#xD;
"I've told -you what happened," answered&#xD;
Margaret, "and- you can believe what. you&#xD;
please ; and it'll be all one to me. Rachel and&#xD;
I are in a hurry, and don't care to be hindered&#xD;
by your elegant conversation, garnished as it&#xD;
is with recollections of the cock-pit. Go home,&#xD;
Ben, to your naked children, and your game-&#xD;
some pets; for you are fitter society for fowls&#xD;
than for females. Stand side !"&#xD;
"You was alleys a saucy jade I" answered&#xD;
Ben, insolently. " If I had a cockerel as saucy&#xD;
as you be, I wouldn't take no money for him.&#xD;
You're a Tartar pullet, and no mistake ! But&#xD;
you don't go on till 1 see what you've got in&#xD;
your bundle."&#xD;
He put out a brawny hand to take the parcel&#xD;
from Margaret, who drew it away.&#xD;
" Come, Ben, be civil, or you'll get what you&#xD;
deserve !" she exclaimed. " We don't expect&#xD;
much of you, but we do expect you to be man-&#xD;
nerly to two young girls, with nobody near to&#xD;
help 'em "&#xD;
" Nobody . near to help ye, eh ?" replied&#xD;
Watrous, significantly. " Tlar's something in&#xD;
that yer, to be sure. Nice wenches, too !&#xD;
Rachel was alleys a belle in these parts, and&#xD;
you're a pretty little devil. Live up the bun-&#xD;
dile, you bantam I"&#xD;
He snatched at the bundle, but Meg pushed&#xD;
him back resolutely. The fellow was growing&#xD;
dangerous. Ills lawless nature was beginning&#xD;
to glow with evil thoughts. Margaret could see&#xD;
his cheeks flushing, she was so neir. His whisk,&#xD;
ky breath touched her face as-he struggled for&#xD;
the parcel.&#xD;
As for Philip, he never had such a conflict&#xD;
with his impetuous te per. Hle was impatient&#xD;
to get hold of the ruffian, and make him feel&#xD;
that a retributive arm was near. Meg, putting&#xD;
one hand behind her, kept admonishing him to&#xD;
silence by sundry pinches and little pushes,;&#xD;
and if it had-not been for 'those constant warn-&#xD;
ings, Philip would have rushed at him at once.&#xD;
Meg's mute manipulations had a wonderful ef-&#xD;
fect on the youth.ecr touches were magnetic,&#xD;
and thrilled him curiously.&#xD;
What was the meaning of this ? It was no-&#xD;
body but Margaret Shore. Ile had.known her&#xD;
ever since she was a child. Hhad,. never&#xD;
thought much of Meg. Meg was so wild. Meg&#xD;
was so unlike other -girls. And then Meg'.&#xD;
mother was such a witch ! There was no need&#xD;
of his feeling queer with Meg, but he (lid.&#xD;
He hadn't supposed that there was anything&#xD;
that wore ,petticoats that could keep bini uuder&#xD;
control wlen his anger began to get the better&#xD;

of him. He had always felt it an exceeding&#xD;
pleasure to. vent his just resentment on an&#xD;
offender ; and that was why he had once fought&#xD;
for Margaret.Shore.&#xD;
Benedict Watrous was yet making passes at&#xD;
the vexatious. bundle, when out came Meg's&#xD;
birthday present. In fact, Ben suddenly felt&#xD;
the cold muzzle of a pistol pressed against his&#xD;
nose.&#xD;
Never was the squatter so electrified. The&#xD;
touch of steel never agreed with him over well.&#xD;
"Stand where you are !" said Meg, firmly.&#xD;
" If you stir, I know this pistol will go off. It&#xD;
is cocked, you coward !"&#xD;
Ben's hands dropped to his sides with won-&#xD;
derful suddennmess. He stood as motionless as a&#xD;
tree. lie knew Meg's nerves were strong and&#xD;
her spirit like steel. There was a glitter in&#xD;
those eyes of hers that he could see in the dark.&#xD;
He had heard of her skill in shooting He had&#xD;
seen her and Phil Crosby practicing at a target&#xD;
no bigger than a dollar. His nose'was a better&#xD;
and a larger target. It might be bored througri&#xD;
in an instant. One of Meg's little claws was on&#xD;
the trigger. What a very slight pressure was&#xD;
needed to break the cap,'ani send a hot and&#xD;
withering blaze through his face! Ben couldn't&#xD;
help thinking of this. The cold tube, pushed,&#xD;
against gis nose, made his thoughts fly more&#xD;
rapidly than they had for a twelve-motnth. His&#xD;
knees thumped against each other. There was&#xD;
an inward quaking with Bed Watrous. He be-&#xD;
gan to plead his own case in a manner worthy&#xD;
of himself:   ,0&#xD;
"Don't, Meg, don't!  I's only jokin', I'll&#xD;
sw'arI"&#xD;
"I'm joking, too, ' answered Margaret, "but&#xD;
very seriously. You insulted me. You came&#xD;
at me, like a beast, as you are. And now per-&#xD;
haps I shall kill you! Rachel is with'me, I&#xD;
must take care of poor Hachel."&#xD;
"Didn't mean nothin', gal !" protested Ben.&#xD;
" Durned if I did ! I like your grit, I do ; but&#xD;
jest take away the shooter, that's a dear ! Pis-&#xD;
tols are careless things to handle, and mighty&#xD;
ticklish 'bout goin' off. I've knowed guns to go&#xD;
off by themselves when nobody was a mindin'&#xD;
'em. Got a pair o' Germantowns I'll give ye&#xD;
fust time I come down."&#xD;
',Kill 'em, and give 'em to your hungry chil-&#xD;
dren," retortedMargaret.&#xD;
By this time the false Rachel had stolen be-&#xD;
hiid the squatter. ' Here was an opportunity&#xD;
that the thoughtless Phil would not and could&#xD;
not forego. Meg could not touch him now.&#xD;
Her left hand was saving something to him, but&#xD;
lie would not lok at it. That mute talk was&#xD;
powerless when he was out of her reach. He&#xD;
unpinned his sister's shawl and let it slip frot&#xD;
his shoulders to the ground. lie braced his&#xD;
right foot behind him.  -lie doubled up his right-&#xD;
fist, lie threw it backward  uiod brought it or-&#xD;
ward with all the force that lie could throw into&#xD;
&#xD;
it by taxing to the utmost all the muscles eon.&#xD;
nected with it.&#xD;
There was a thud-a distinctive sound-a&#xD;
palpable hit, and the cock-fighter measured his&#xD;
length upon the earth. I suppose there never&#xD;
was such a blowv; or, at least, Phil was of that&#xD;
opinion, and the squatter remembered it long&#xD;
afterward.&#xD;
While he was recovering from the shock, Phil&#xD;
put on his shawl. Margaret pulled him by the&#xD;
sleeve  "In an instant," said he. "I want to&#xD;
see how he gets up."&#xD;
Another imperative pull from Meg brought&#xD;
him to a sense of the situation. He turned&#xD;
quickly and followed his brave guide.&#xD;
Watrous arose in three motions, each of a re-&#xD;
flective character. He stared after the lessen-&#xD;
ing skirts of the seeming Rachel and the real&#xD;
Meg.&#xD;
' Wall!" muttered Ben. " What a blow for&#xD;
a gal!"&#xD;
He swiveled his head slowly to and fro on his&#xD;
shoulders, partly to see if it was in running or-&#xD;
der, and partly to express astonishment. He&#xD;
put his hand under his ear, and while arther&#xD;
testing the vertebra by additional moverents,&#xD;
repeated :&#xD;
"What a blow for a gal! Stunner, she is!&#xD;
A female airthquake, by mighty !"&#xD;
He stood there wondering, until Meg and&#xD;
Philip were out of sight.&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
MEG AND PHIL PURSUED&#xD;
On went Meg, and on went Phil. His spirited&#xD;
guide went slowly till she could no longer see&#xD;
the dusky figure of Benedict Watrops, then&#xD;
quickened her steps. She was afraid of pur..&#xD;
suit, and scolded the young man for yielding to&#xD;
his impulive disposition.&#xD;
" You were always a hasty boy," said Brown&#xD;
Meg, " and over-fond of taking up the quarrels&#xD;
of other people. I remember your freaks very&#xD;
well. If a litle lad were assaulted by a big one,&#xD;
you were sure to get into a contest with the big&#xD;
one. You made yourself ridiculous, once, by a&#xD;
pitched battle with a great lout who called me a&#xD;
witch." '&#xD;
'I should think you'd ought to thank me for&#xD;
that," answered Phil.&#xD;
-' Probably ; but then, you know, young&#xD;
women forget boys so soon.'&#xD;
Meg said this in a lofty manner.&#xD;
It really seemed to Phil that there was con-&#xD;
descension in her tones. He was piqued, and&#xD;
thought of her words some time. Boys and&#xD;
young women ! She was the young woman and&#xD;
lie the boy, obviously. A very young woman&#xD;
she was! He looked at her aspshe gli4ed along&#xD;
the path before him. She was small, but well-&#xD;
developed. Her figure was certainly excellent&#xD;

fierce brute?",&#xD;
"I will mind !you,Phil, but do not be rash.&#xD;
As you love life and your mother, do- not, it&#xD;
the creature fasten upon you."&#xD;
Just then the hound sent its terrible voice&#xD;
into the cavern. Philip sprang to the mouth of&#xD;
the little cave, muttering:-&#xD;
" The beast ought to know a white man from&#xD;
a negro !"&#xD;
The hound stood. nearly over him, making a&#xD;
frightful noise. Grasping some of the shaub-&#xD;
-bery Philip bent it down so as to obstruct the&#xD;
entrance of the fleet-footed animal.  Its hot&#xD;
breath fumed down upon, his face.&#xD;
"I'm .dreadfully afraid, Phil 1" whispered&#xD;
Margaret, again close behind him.    "&#xD;
"Don't be terrified !" answered Philip, in a&#xD;
low tone.  " Why will you- keep, near - me ?&#xD;
Back, Meg, back !"&#xD;
"It's not for myself, Phil, that rm afraid ;.-it&#xD;
is for you. You fought for meonce, Phil. I&#xD;
never shall forget it, never ! 'I don't care What&#xD;
happens to me, but yon. must not be hurt nor&#xD;
taken. I should die, Phil, if they were to shoot&#xD;
you !"&#xD;
Philip knew she was crying. Her voice was&#xD;
very soft and submissive, and he heard little&#xD;
sobs.&#xD;
The hound made a dash at the aperture, but&#xD;
,was repulsed by the shrubbery, which increased&#xD;
its fury, and it began to rend the little trees&#xD;
with its teeth.-&#xD;
"Dear-Margaret !" answered -Philip; thrilled&#xD;
by her words. " I'l remember you, -after this,&#xD;
as long as I live. You are a faithful girl, and I&#xD;
have been a selfish fool not, to know it. You&#xD;
have humbled:-me, Meg. 'I ought to get down&#xD;
on' my knees and ask you to foreive'me."&#xD;
" No, no,'Phil! That would be a bad place'&#xD;
for you. You know I am not well born, and&#xD;
'am a great deal:talked about."'&#xD;
"You never shall be.talked about again,.if I!&#xD;
get out of this serape !" responded 'Phil with al&#xD;
heartiness that made Meg's heart jump-for joy.&#xD;
The young .man bad now all.that he could&#xD;
attend to. The hound gathered, to launch its,&#xD;
long, slim body down-upon him. He fired as it&#xD;
was in the act of. springing. Immediately he'&#xD;
was stricken down by its body. He heard-a cry'&#xD;
from Margaret, andfur-ions as 'the beast itself,.&#xD;
threw himself forward, and grappled: with it.,&#xD;

She was lying insepsible. He caught her-in,his&#xD;

had just left..&#xD;
Her face was very pale,,and her pretty lips&#xD;

spirit he had, and as nothing else could have&#xD;
done. Had Phil broken the cock-fighter's arm,&#xD;
he would have'stirred his animosity less.&#xD;
Having finished loading, he ran about like a&#xD;
madman, shouting and threatening.&#xD;
His comrade was equally active. He called&#xD;
upon the fugitives to. come out and deliver&#xD;
themselves up, on pain of being instantly shot.&#xD;
He vowed that the woods were surrounded with&#xD;
men, and that it was useless to try to escape.&#xD;
He addressed the unseen Philip both as the'&#xD;
peddler and the deserter, so as to be sure and&#xD;
get the right man.   Between the two, the&#xD;
woods resounded with menaces and imprecations.&#xD;
Around the base of the hill crept Phil.aid&#xD;
Meg, giving little heed to these clamors. Com-&#xD;
ing unexpectedly upon the horses, which Jonas&#xD;
and Ben had hitched to a young hickory, Philip&#xD;
took off, their saddles and bridles, and giving&#xD;
them some smart cuts, sent them clattering up&#xD;
the hill. This was a trick that the men had not&#xD;
counted on, and it put them -into the vilest&#xD;
temper imaginable. Off they scampered to&#xD;
catch the runaways,. thinking that Meg and&#xD;
Phil rode on their backs ; but coming in sight&#xD;
of the animals, after a sharp run, they, diseQv-&#xD;
ered their mistake.&#xD;
What now ? Should they abandon the quad-&#xD;
rupeds and follow the bipeds ? They looked at&#xD;
each other, and after some discussion, and some&#xD;
inverted prayers, turned back to find the trail.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
RACHEL PROvES A BAD BOY.&#xD;
Away sped John Brant on the legs of his&#xD;
high horse, with Rachel behind him, and the&#xD;
great fallacy in his mind "that he had Philip.&#xD;
Spitfire stretched on beautifully.  The swift&#xD;
motion was exhilarating to the planter. His&#xD;
long, dark hair streamed on the wind made by&#xD;
his'own velocity. With his face upturned, h3&#xD;
breathed in the fast-coming air,, and his blood&#xD;
flowed with excitement.'&#xD;
"Phil," said John Brant, by and by, "are&#xD;
you there ?"&#xD;
" Yes," answered the counterfeit deserter,&#xD;
fintly, for she felt herself awkwardly placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
I  " Clasp me tighter, boy," added John. "You&#xD;
take hold as gingerly as a girl."&#xD;
Rachel grasped him more closely ; but the&#xD;
difference was so trifling that it did not satisfy&#xD;
the bold rider.&#xD;
"PhilI" he exclaimed, " you used to be an&#xD;
active and dashing lad, but now you sit behind&#xD;
me like a bird on one's finger. You are either&#xD;
growing effeminate, or you're frightened out of&#xD;
your wits You'll be off, first thing I know I"&#xD;
John reached behind him and tucked up the&#xD;
false Philip.&#xD;
"People usually grow hard by soldiering,&#xD;
but you have grown soft, my lad," continued&#xD;
Brant.&#xD;
A glimpse at Rachel's face would have been&#xD;
worth something ; but there was nobody there&#xD;
to see it. Brant tried to make his young friend&#xD;
talk, but could elicit not a word save monosyl-&#xD;
lables. The tucking up 'and the warning to&#xD;
hold tighter, were often repeated on the way.&#xD;
They weie soon at Paw-Paw. Rachel slipped&#xD;
off the instant Spitfire, stopped. Some sleepy&#xD;
blacks cane, yawning, to take his horse.&#xD;
" Groom him well, you rascals !" said John&#xD;
"Rub every hair of him-dry. Don't leave hint&#xD;
till he's as clean as a lady's hand  Take at&#xD;
him, four of you, and don't let him get a chill.&#xD;
He may. he wanted presently." Then turning&#xD;
to go in, he added : " I wonder where the ped-&#xD;
dler is?  Well, he's- welcome to Clipper. I&#xD;
feel better for having settled that Black Swamp&#xD;
affair. Jack will have to foot it home, and he&#xD;
hates to walk abominably. Come, Phil I . We'll&#xD;
go in and take some refreshments, but it won't&#xD;
be safe for you to stay here long, I'm afraid.&#xD;
The little tailor will be after yo i with his&#xD;
posse ; but I shan't give you up. My house is&#xD;
my castle, any day"; and I haven't forgotten&#xD;
the cotton-buring. Let 'em toneh another&#xD;
fibre of my cotton ! Let 'em so much as look at&#xD;
it with incendiary eyes, and see what they'll&#xD;
get?"&#xD;
Into his wife's chamber strode John Brant,&#xD;
Rachel walking behind him like Puss in Boots.&#xD;
He stopped near the middle of the room. On&#xD;
a lounge lay the partner of his life, in a tran-&#xD;
quil sleep. His thudding boots lid not awake&#xD;
her. He stood still and looked at her. She&#xD;
was quiet enough, but her face was unusually&#xD;
pale, and there was a white circle around her&#xD;
mouth.&#xD;
John went nearer.&#xD;
"Poor Celia !" he murmured. "Something&#xD;
has occurred to harry her. She never has that&#xD;
spiritual expression but after a great shock.&#xD;
What can have happened ?". He took her&#xD;
hand 1 it was quite cold, and lay, heavily in his,&#xD;
as if the nerves had lost their spring. He&#xD;
spoke to her; he raised her, he shook her, and&#xD;
she awoke slowly. Seeing. John, however, she&#xD;
smiled, and her blood began to warm again.f,&#xD;

panic. Tell me about it.".&#xD;
All this tine Rachel stood by herself.e There.&#xD;
was a bright light in the room, and'her face and:&#xD;
pe son were well illuninated. Celia's eyes bad 1&#xD;
caught her. Her feminine face, her full bust,&#xD;
her swelling lips; revealed her sex 'in an in-,&#xD;
stant.t&#xD;
"Whom have you brought here ?" asked Ce-&#xD;
l'ia,'faintly.                             t&#xD;
"The young rogue, Phil,"-answered John, t&#xD;
frankly. Theni noticing Celia's expression, he j&#xD;
turned, wonderingly, toward the suppositious&#xD;
puth. One look 'satisfied him that there had &#xD;
been a mistake.~ .le wasa surprised, aind cons.7&#xD;
fused: He stared at the counterfeit with open&#xD;
month.&#xD;
"Rachel Crosby !" exclaimed Celia  " What&#xD;
deception is this, John ?'&#xD;
Rachel crimsoned.. The situation was'getting&#xD;
awkward.&#xD;
"Confound' me if;I know !" protested John.,&#xD;
growing red in the firce."-&#xD;
" 0 John, bow can you deceive me so!"! cried.4&#xD;
Celia.&#xD;
"My dear girl, I'swear-" began Jehn.&#xD;
" Don't sweur, husband ! ' Swearing don't&#xD;
make truth' any truer. You bright this young&#xD;
lady with you, John, in disguise '?&#xD;
" So it seems," answered Brant. " Certainly&#xD;
that is the person who rode behind- me from&#xD;
Crosby's. Don't be foolish, Celia. You know&#xD;
you can be foolish as easy as any woman in the&#xD;
world."&#xD;
"Ann Shore has been here, John."&#xD;
She said' these words' in a voice of solemn&#xD;
resignation.&#xD;
" The old harridan ! I got the cream of her&#xD;
venom, I guess ; and she has been setting the&#xD;
milk df her- wrath' these -six' 'months; to rise.-&#xD;
She lacerated you, didn't she?"&#xD;
Indeed she did, John! There 'is no more&#xD;
peace for me."'&#xD;
" Nonsense! You shall be the most peaceful&#xD;
vonian in existence. 'I swear' you shall do noth-&#xD;
ing bd' be happy!"&#xD;
Celia began to cry.':    "&#xD;
" I have had erioigh without Rauhel, John."&#xD;
"By Jul iter Celia, I'didn'b know I had her.!&#xD;
I  noticed' that Phil took hold of me - as if he&#xD;
wer'e handling hot chestnuts; and' that 'he-felt&#xD;
wadded'; but'as true asI live-"&#xD;
"John !" interrupted Celia, warningly.&#xD;
" As true as I live," he went ol, " wetook her&#xD;

"you have been drifil"id."&#xD;
" Not a drep l" asset-ted Brant.&#xD;

"What 'has a peddler's paclk to do with Ra-'&#xD;
ohel Crosby? John,'you cannot tell a good&#xD;
&#xD;
falsehood. But I will not trouble you loi&#xD;
with my presence. I have long been in your&#xD;
way."° Mrs. Brant turned her back on Rachel,&#xD;
and anger was getting the better of her am1a-&#xD;
bility&#xD;
. "Be patient a 'monk-ent, Mrs. .Brant," inter-&#xD;
posed Rachel. - " You'r brave husband speaks&#xD;
he truth. I was indeed .substituted for my&#xD;
brother Philip,in the round pack of the' peddler&#xD;
Gles   Mr. Brant was there when I came out of&#xD;
the pack-; but' he was not present when J was&#xD;
putin. I personated Phil ; or, at least, attempt-&#xD;
ed to; but I did take the character. very badly,&#xD;
I confess."&#xD;
Qelia listened and shook her head.&#xD;
John was going to explain, but she stopped&#xD;
him and said :.&#xD;
"'Go on, girl. I do not in the least understand&#xD;
about the pack. It seems-a trumped-up story."&#xD;
It isn't a -thumped-up story, though!" re-&#xD;
torted Raehel  with spirit.. "'My brother Philip&#xD;
was brought home-in a pack."&#xD;
" Who, carried the pack ?" asked Celia,. in-&#xD;
credulously. "It-must have been. a burden for&#xD;
a horse !"&#xD;
'f Oh, a stout man brought it !" said Rachel,&#xD;
piqued at'Mrs. Brantts unbelief, and the uneom-&#xD;
plimentary view she was -taking of the. case.&#xD;
She was beginning to think that her jealousy&#xD;
was as insulting as it was unreasonable.&#xD;
" Is that a eommorf method of desertion from&#xD;
the Confederate Army ?" asked Celia, with se-&#xD;
verity of tone and glance.&#xD;
"The peddler did- hot carry my brother all&#xD;
the way, but only through the Confederate.lines&#xD;
and Bayou bottom. But the artifice, cunning&#xD;
as it was, was suspected by that prying. Ben&#xD;
Watrous, who visited our house at an unseason-&#xD;
able hour and saw -the. pack on the floor while&#xD;
Philip was in it. Whether he was struck by its&#xD;
size, or whether my, brother moved, I do not&#xD;
know ; but away he went, and by-and-by came&#xD;
a squad of soldiers from Phil's regiment, the&#xD;
Tenth, Tennessee, but not till Margaret Shore&#xD;
had p t -him into my gown; and me into this&#xD;
uniform, and into the pack. Philip, personating&#xD;
myself, was unmolested;- but the round pack&#xD;
was made to.give up its secret. . Your 'hun'band&#xD;
gallantly caught me uap went out at the window,&#xD;
set me on his.horse, and I am here. It was a&#xD;
dashing and- generous feat. I hope, my dear&#xD;
Mhdam, that you are, now satisfied."&#xD;
Every shadow of doubt was lifted from Mrs.&#xD;
Bran 's face. She .gave Rachel. hmeit hand,,and&#xD;
gaid:&#xD;
Forgiverne, Miss Crosby ! Ihave had' mueh&#xD;
to disturb, ne to-night. You, doubtless, w.ihto&#xD;
get out-of these garments. . Come with me, and&#xD;
I will be your tirewoman, for:I dare say.you do&#xD;
not wish my maid to see you in this character."&#xD;
" Well, Celia, I stand acqnited  dou't-I ?'&#xD;
"Yes, John," she said, and sighed.&#xD;
" Don't sigh at me,; my dear," muttered&#xD;

TIE ROUND PACK.&#xD;
&#xD;
anl by, he came to a smalr stream, with cottonI&#xD;
and ,grass on its low banks.,&#xD;
le dismounted near a camp thatched with&#xD;
evergreen boughs ; but so curiously nestled&#xD;
among the bushes as not to attract one's atten-&#xD;
tion until almost within .reach of it. Securinij&#xD;
his horse to a tree, where be.could reach the&#xD;
sweet grass, in went Giles, and toek possession&#xD;
of this shelter. le was just falling asleep, when&#xD;
lie heard two persons talking, and a moment af-&#xD;
ter they entered the camp.  The twain'were&#xD;
Meg and PhWikL -&#xD;
le of the round pack, though much surprised,&#xD;
kept still and did not reveal himself 'The girl&#xD;
was panting for breath, and evidently quite&#xD;
flurried Phil was doing his best to re-assure&#xD;
her.&#xD;
" The greatest danger is over, Cousin Meg,"&#xD;
said he, " for the hound has sneaked off, with&#xD;
precious little life in it, The horses must be&#xD;
well on their way home by this time, while the&#xD;
two rogues who rode them seem to have lost our&#xD;
trail. Don't breathe so hard."&#xD;
"I can't help it. Philip," answered Meg.&#xD;
" I wish I could do something for you, Mar-&#xD;
garet. Here's a seat; -sit down, my good girl."&#xD;
Meg sank exhausted upon it seat,.which was a&#xD;
rude bench, with oak leaves upon it for a cush-&#xD;
ion. Plilin was beside her. lie sat down&#xD;
" It is horrid dark !" said Meg.&#xD;
" The darkness is good for us ; it keeps us&#xD;
but of sight."&#xD;
".Do you feel queerly at the stomach, Phil?"&#xD;
asked Meg.-&#xD;
Not a bit of it,- said Phil.&#xD;
" I am afraid that dreadful white may hurt you.&#xD;
You oughtn't to have meddled with it, Philip.&#xD;
But 'you meant well, I am sure. You meant&#xD;
well, too, when you fought the big boy."&#xD;
" It wasn't anything, Meg.  What do I care&#xD;
for poison in a girl's arm? I'd as lief take more&#xD;
out of it as not."&#xD;
"You've got poison enough, young man,"&#xD;
thought Giles.&#xD;
"Where ,is the arm ?" 'asked Phil, naively,&#xD;
groping for it, but finding Meg's waist instead.&#xD;
" Lean on me, Margaret ; you tremble so."&#xD;
"It comes of hurrying;" answered Margaret.&#xD;
Don't get too near, Phil; 'Im a very rude giul,&#xD;
you know."&#xD;
I don't know," said Phil,.thoughtfully, lean-&#xD;
ing toward her. " can't remember anything&#xD;
positively rude, of you.  You were always a&#xD;
proud And spirited creature, though h j believe&#xD;
you kept your dignity pretty well up." '&#xD;
" There's some good in me, don't you think&#xD;
there' islPhil ?" .&#xD;
Yes, yes ;'there'is, in fact, a ,good deal l"&#xD;
&#xD;
his face, the focus would ,have caught a smile&#xD;
on hIs lips,,&#xD;
, "Mind what you're about, Phil. My mother&#xD;
is adreadfulwitch," said Margaret, warningly.&#xD;
"I believe you're a, with," too," answered&#xD;
Phil, softly                            - 2&#xD;
" I am witch. e ough not to be flattered to-&#xD;
day And forgotten to-morrow,",said hargaret.&#xD;
" I have seen people put a flower in their but-&#xD;
ton-hole one minute, and throw it a£wav the&#xD;
next. , That was because the flower was power-&#xD;
less, and could not help being plucked,.worin,&#xD;
and east away. The girl, sometimes called Meg&#xD;
Wildfire, is not a passive thing, to be used. in&#xD;
that way. You'll find me neither a lily nor a&#xD;
rose, but the freest of all birds, not to'be caught&#xD;
by hand or net.  He that chases me with idle&#xD;
purpose, loses his time ,and his breath in the&#xD;
pursuit. So, my dear cousin. Phil, spare your&#xD;
compliments, and remember that I was the same&#xD;
yesterday that I am to-day: the daughter of a&#xD;
woman very ill-spoken of, and - a 'girl of rather&#xD;
bad habits, if gossips are to be believed. As I&#xD;
was not quite worth your serious notice a short&#xD;
time ago, I can't be much better now ; so hands-&#xD;
off, my kinsman !"&#xD;
Philip was never accused of too much modesty&#xD;
in his life ; but with all his faith in himself, the&#xD;
remarks of Meg Shore nearly overcame himn with&#xD;
surprise. , Hle sat silent, wondering what to say.&#xD;
She waited for himto answer.:-.          }&#xD;
" Come,eousia, don't take wing when a friend&#xD;
is approaching,' he replied, somewhat chop-&#xD;
fallen. " I never,saw such a girl as you are !',&#xD;
" Because I won't be petted now and worried&#xD;
to-morrow. I've seen the dog and eat play ;&#xD;

the dog was sure to chase puss into an apple.&#xD;
tree the first ,time he .found her off the door-&#xD;

" Don't scratch me, Puss!" said Phil, tartly.&#xD;
Margaret laughed, and answerd :  ,   1&#xD;
" You have been a good enough dog tonight,&#xD;
Phil.; and as for the apple-tree, I will look out&#xD;
for that to-morrow. Your harryings. of the&#xD;

Meg saa, thiin the sweetest way that it was&#xD;
possible fyr. a sour girl to-speak in.&#xD;
" Almost!" said Phil,,sullenly. " I think it's&#xD;

"Tivill always think of you. Don't litiger, and&#xD;
send a line to your mother th? first chance that&#xD;
offers. Now 'go 'fast."&#xD;
Phil toolk'her hantd, and seemed unwillingg to&#xD;
part' with' it. He 'gave 'it several shakes and&#xD;
eqheezes, and the peddler turning' to adjust&#xD;
C ipler's bridle at 'the 'critical'- moment, he&#xD;
kissed her. 'It was the. first tine 'his lips ever&#xD;
touched her's'; and be felt"that "he 'had not&#xD;

waved an adieuto 'Giles, and disappeared in&#xD;

"'There goes abrave and trusty lad," said the&#xD;
peddler. EIf you have fairly touched his&#xD;

there 'is no dqubting, for I 'know the' race'from&#xD;
which you sprang,"'&#xD;
He said these' words thoughtfully.&#xD;
"You say things occasionally," replied Mar-&#xD;
garet; " that I cannot understand. What you&#xD;
know of me, I cannot even guess.' At any rate,&#xD;
I'm not worth talking about. -Even a stranger,&#xD;

flygway girl by just stepping within the town&#xD;
limits. Come, mysterious cynic, avow yourself."&#xD;
"Let us attend 'to practical thatters, Miss&#xD;
'Mrgarget.",&#xD;
So saying, he' wound his fingers into Clippe'r's&#xD;
pnane, and sWung himself easily into the saddle-'&#xD;
and before Meg was aware of his' intention, he&#xD;
bent lbw, caught her by the arats, and lifted her&#xD;
1ip before him. She was cradled carefully in his&#xD;
arms in a moment, ,and Clipper was rocking&#xD;
both with an easy motion.&#xD;
CHAPTER     XXIII.&#xD;
TAmE iER AWAY.&#xD;
'The man of the round hpaek rode boldly tow-&#xD;
%rd Crosby'e. Meg remonstrated ;' 'sle entreat-&#xD;
ed ; she tried, to slip down from the pomatel,-&#xD;
but the arms'of the peddler held her in' a firm&#xD;
grasp.She did not wish him to " run into&#xD;
danger".         '',,&#xD;
" Danger," said Giles, " is what n'am used to.&#xD;
J helieve''as much In- destiny 'as Napoleon Vona-&#xD;
parte did.' No man can die till liia time Comes,&#xD;
ry'hd ever'io'hard. My star is' not old enough&#xD;
to set yet, 'nor bright enough to"'make 'muoh&#xD;

ny opinion that' the 'Sergeant wont come back&#xD;
&#xD;
again,'and' we'll clmnter by Ann -Shore's door as&#xD;
we go-albng."&#xD;
" Be careful what you say of my mother!"&#xD;
warned Meg. "&#xD;
w "Of her," answered the peddler, with em -&#xD;
Inbasis,- I'll say nothing. Bat of that no mor'&#xD;
Everything has -its appropriate season. Th--,&#xD;
course of nature muat be followed.' Fevers have&#xD;
their time to turn, and intermittents their' reg'-&#xD;

have their' time to' be told. Wine grows better&#xD;
as it grows'old'; and secrets, well kept, are like&#xD;
wine, But here we are at the cabin of the nuc-&#xD;
turnal woman. She thought to' do me a harm&#xD;
this night; but I did not wait for the ripening&#xD;
of her plot."&#xD;
He reined Clipper up to-the door, which was&#xD;
open. A hot fire was blazing on the hearth.&#xD;
and the steam'and flavor of boiling herbs flowed&#xD;
out into their faces. Margaret sighed.&#xD;
"Sigh iot," said Giles,' kindly.' "Comfort&#xD;
your little- heart. This woman is not youm&#xD;
tmother.. This much I will tell you; though -]&#xD;
meant it not five minutes ago."  The tone, the&#xD;
manner, and, more than all, supremely above&#xD;
all.' the announcement penetrated every nerve&#xD;
and 'consciousness of Margaret.' Her arms fell&#xD;
heavily upon his, and her head sank back upon&#xD;
his breast.' Meg- had fainted.  The glorious&#xD;
golden light of the early sun fell upon her now&#xD;
white face like a baptism of fire. She looked&#xD;
fair in the eyes of the manwho held her.&#xD;
" What,0'ho01 Ann'Shore !" cried Giles.&#xD;
The old woman toddled to the door.&#xD;
"Here again on your high horse, Dick ?" she&#xD;
said. " What burden is that in your arms? Is&#xD;
it Meg  'What have - you been doing to her ?&#xD;
$he looks like a corpse !"&#xD;
"Bring water,' Ann," he answered.  " The&#xD;
child -has fainted."&#xD;
"Then you've - been' blabbing in her ears,&#xD;
renegade !' screamed Ann.&#xD;
" Your'beggarly friends 'have frightened her,"&#xD;
said Giles. " Some of your squatter neighbors&#xD;
hate $iven her nerves a shock.   Since the&#xD;
breakhig out 'of the Rebellion, even young&#xD;
maidens are not- afe. Some of your halters&#xD;
might' 'db good service , were they used near&#xD;
home."&#xD;
Meg was reviving.&#xD;
"1 want no water !" she murmured. "I am&#xD;
well enough nbw."&#xD;
"'" Take her away h"'cried Ann. " She helped&#xD;
Phil, the deserter, get away."' .&#xD;
Grimakey-flew at Clippeir'a hoofs and tried to&#xD;
bite them ; but his littleteeth slipped from them&#xD;
as if they' were iron. This so provoked his&#xD;
wrath,-that 'he' made fierce bounds at the ped-&#xD;
dler'S'feet.'  "  ;'&#xD;
"No kith nor kin of mine," added' Ann, spite..&#xD;
fully, "ean side with the Norther i negro-freers,&#xD;

Jack, with the bridle-reiinn his hand, step-&#xD;

"Open your jacket, Jack."&#xD;
The peddler passed 'him the packet with a&#xD;

"We'll send round, a few fellows to cut their&#xD;

the papers with trembling hands and palpitat-&#xD;

" Do you want yquaikaibty, Jack ?"&#xD;
Jack sighed, shook his head, and looked down&#xD;
at his brogans in profound meditation.&#xD;
" I guess, Missis, to tell'the truff, we should&#xD;
all like to hey the freedom. Fact is, should&#xD;
like to hey it by me, if I didn't never want to&#xD;
use it. Now that yer is the whole story."&#xD;
"You shall have your freedom, Jack," said&#xD;
Mrs. Brant, impressively. " You are free from&#xD;
this instant. Your papers shall be made out&#xD;
this very dny."&#xD;
"Thank ye, Missis, ten thousand' times t But&#xD;
'twon't make so much dif'rence to me as it does&#xD;
to some others ; for you know I could run away&#xD;
anytime on one o' Mars'r's bosses, and the deb-&#xD;
ble couldn't ketch me. I stays kase I likes to,&#xD;
and don't take to my heels kase I s'pect liberty&#xD;
is coming' here to save us runnin' for't."&#xD;
They were interrupted at this point by the&#xD;
hurried entrance of Brant.&#xD;
" The cotton-burners are taken, Celia !" he&#xD;
exclaimed. The Federal cavalry has nabbed&#xD;
them, man and horse, and some of our squatter&#xD;
pests have got their deserts. Our black boys&#xD;
had a special grudge against them. Ben Wat-&#xD;
rous may recover, but he has lost an eye, at all&#xD;
events. His two comrades, Thorne and Furness,&#xD;
will never enter cock-pit again. The best of&#xD;
all is, that the cotton is saved."&#xD;
" Not the best of all, Mars'r John, not the&#xD;
best of all !" said Jack, pointing to the papers&#xD;
on the table. "Thar's some papers that the&#xD;
paddler-man gave me, which is better than the&#xD;
best."&#xD;
Celia gathered them  up, and placed them in&#xD;
John Brant's hands, who, at first, could look at&#xD;
nothing but her sparkling eyes.&#xD;
" From Richard Shore 1" she said, her cheeks&#xD;
pushing.&#xD;
"Richard Shore I" repeated Brant, greatly&#xD;
surprised.&#xD;
" The hero of the Round Pack," added Celia.&#xD;
"And of the Black Swamp," said Jack.&#xD;
Brant glanced from one to the other, then at&#xD;
the papers. His countenance changed.&#xD;
"Safe, safe I" he cried. "From  my heart&#xD;
and soul, dear Celia, I am glad of this. Now&#xD;
there is nothing to trouble you. You will be&#xD;
happy, I am sure."&#xD;
Brant's eyes happened to rest on the shat:-&#xD;
tered pane through which Jack had thrown the&#xD;
vial.&#xD;
" Just in time, Mars'r I" said Jack, with a sig-&#xD;
nificant motion of the head." " These yer&#xD;
papers wouldn't done no good in a little&#xD;
while."&#xD;
&#xD;
N "   mray good girl," qpoth John, seizing&#xD;
Ceiabt eaistihnd waltzing her around the&#xD;
rQon   9at distrabted 'esnh t o niore drop&#xD;
'lag 9 the 'eyes,  Ato'e gi-eeti and yellow&#xD;

Sus sn  our{ fingers at.:it and'go in for the&#xD;
," eid 'M;is. rant " I noticed i&#xD;
opening gat a1alret,  th thi risar a small&#xD;
hole through the parchment envelope and one&#xD;
or two of the papers. What caused it?"&#xD;
" A bullet," answered Brant. " It probably&#xD;
would have lodged here somewhere"-he put&#xD;
his hand to his breast-" had not this silly Jack&#xD;
sprung before me, and caught it. The pncket&#xD;
saved his life."&#xD;
"And mine, too, I think I" said Celia, gravely.&#xD;
John Brant drew her closer to him.&#xD;
"I have promised him   his freedom," she&#xD;
added.&#xD;
" And. I confirm the promise ; and I will do&#xD;
more for Jack than that. So Meg Shore turns&#xD;
out to be rich. I am really glad.- I must go&#xD;
home with Rachel, by and by, and tell Margaret&#xD;
of her good fortune. She and Phil will make a&#xD;
match some day, if he don't get killed or&#xD;
hanged. A rash fellow is Phil. You and I will&#xD;
go to the wedding, Celia--when it takes pines!&#xD;
But this Richard Shore; this Giles ; this peddle e i&#xD;
I am sorry I let him slip away. If I'd mis-&#xD;
trusted who he was, I'd had him here, if I'd&#xD;
been obliged to bring him by force. I owe&#xD;
that man no ordinary debt. I thought he was&#xD;
a sinister, misanthropic dog, at first, but he has&#xD;
the ring of the true metal."&#xD;
" Said he'd take proper good care o' Clipper,&#xD;
Mars'r John," said Jack.&#xD;
" He's welcome to all the horses in my stable,"&#xD;
replied Brant, with emphasis. "But he's got&#xD;
a devil of an aunt ! .Now, Celia, for some din-&#xD;
ner, and a friendly clinking of glasses with the&#xD;
Yankee Colonel.   Look out of the window,&#xD;
wife! There flaunts the old flag. Upon my&#xD;
soul, I like it ! I can't help liking it. I doubt&#xD;
whether there's a Secessionist in the whole coun-&#xD;
try who does not secretly respect it. Perhaps I&#xD;
shall die for it, after all.&#xD;
John Brant gazed earnestly at the Federal&#xD;
banner. His eyes grew watery. He was think-&#xD;
ing of history and of the gaping -wounds which&#xD;
Liberty had received; Celia leaned heavily on&#xD;
his breast, and he heard a low sobbing.&#xD;
"Jack, my good fellow, go -out and declare a&#xD;
holiday for the boys. Let no work be done for&#xD;
forty-eight hours. Celia, we will take gallant&#xD;
gallop, to-morrow, with Spitfire and Pepper-&#xD;
corn."&#xD;
And so they walked out on the balcony;&#xD;
hand-in-hand. The Federal cavalry seeing the&#xD;
planter and his wife, cheered them till they&#xD;
were hoarse.&#xD;
There was good fare that day for those brave&#xD;
fellows ; and those of them who survive the&#xD;
