                  <head>I SEEK AND FIND.</head>
                  <p>I AM now a man full sixty years of age; but, when I look back upon the eventful
                     past, I feel that I ought much rather to say a hundred. My experience possesses
                     little of romance or thrilling interest; and yet, because of its significance,
                     and to save others from falling into a like pitfall of delusion with myself, I
                     claim the privilege of relating it.</p>
                  <p>When a young man of eighteen, I wrote poetry for the papers; I parted my hair
                     in the middle, and let it fall in long, flowing curls upon my shoulders; I also
                     wore a "turn-over collar," which won for me from some of my unsympathizing
                     neighbors the undignified title of "goose-neck;" and I was seldom without a
                     rose-bud, or some other flower, in the button-hole of my waistcoat. My first
                     poem, published in a <emph>weekly</emph> known as "Cupid's Courier," was a
                     "Sonnet to the Moon;" my second was entitled "The Lone Lover's Lament," in<pb
                        n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6310-00000005"/> which I poured forth all my passionate
                     longings for that companionship, which, at that period, seemed the grand
                     desideratum of life. It was quickly responded to by another contributor, who
                     signed her name as "Myra Myrtle;" and soon after I received a sweetly
                     sympathizing letter, traced in fairy-like characters, with this same name
                     subscribed thereto.</p>
                  <p>Of course, I answered without delay, praying for a continuation of the
                     correspondence. This favor was granted in a sweet note, which came soon after,
                     written on pink paper scented with musk, and sealed with two hearts cruelly
                     thrust through with a murderous dart. I felt that this device was exceedingly
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">apropos;</foreign> for I was sensible that the
                     corresponding organ in my own breast was effectually pierced by the arrow of
                     the "blind god," and, if my fair unknown was in the same case, I deeply
                     sympathized with her.</p>
                  <p>We exchanged letters many weeks, and I completely exhausted my brains for
                     delicate expressions and endearing terms in which to address her. Finally I
                     could endure suspense no longer, and I besought the lady most passionately for
                     an interview; but she seemed unwilling to grant it. I became almost frantic;
                     for the ideal image of the fair face that bent above those sweetly-scented
                     missives, and the hand that traced those delicate lines, was before my vision
                     night and day. I placed my petitions in every form of speech which human
                     ingenuity could invent, and finally threatened suicide, which seemed to have
                     the desired effect; for the next note informed me that she would meet me upon
                     the following evening at a place called "The Lover's Retreat,"—a secluded spot,
                     and well calculated for such an interview.</p>
                  <p>How long that day seemed! I watched the sun, as it slowly sank in the west,
                     with feelings of unmingled impatience. Then the great, full moon rose
                     gloriously from behind the distant hill-tops, pouring a flood of silvery
                     radiance over the face of all nature, and paling the light of the evening star,
                     which had shone forth so brightly amid the crimson glories of the sunset. The
                     clock upon the village church struck eight, and the appointed hour had
                     arrived.</p>
                  <p>With a palpitating heart in my bosom and a bouquet in my hand, I started for
                     the hallowed spot. A few moments' hasty walk by a rippling stream, and through
                     winding wood-paths, brought me into the presence of my beloved. She sat with
                     her head leaned upon her hand, and her face turned from me; but the white
                     dress, the gracefully-disposed shawl, and the gypsy hat, suited my taste
                     precisely.</p>
                  <p>"Myra, dear Myra!" I murmured, as I stood beside her.</p>
                  <p>"Earnest!" she exclaimed, and, springing up, she threw her arms about me, and
                     almost suffocated me with kisses. I was surprised at such a cordial reception,
                     and it was some time before I could recover myself; for her embrace greatly
                     resembled that ascribed to a Greenland bear. When I did regain my composure,
                     however, the first thing I observed by the telltale light of the moon, was,
                     that my sweet Myra <emph>wore whiskers;</emph> and a second glance revealed to
                     my astonished gaze the well-known features of my cousin, Billy Wentworth,—a
                     very sensible fellow, but a most incorrigible wag, and the greatest practical
                     joker in the village. I felt for a moment as if my head was a windmill, and was
                     grinding my heart to powder.</p>
                  <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6310-00000006"/>
                  <p>"Billy," I gasped, as soon as I could take a long breath, "are <emph>you</emph>
                     my Myra Myrtle?"</p>
                  <p>"Yours till death do us part!" replied Billy, with a dramatic air.</p>
                  <p>"Did <emph>you</emph> write that poem for the paper, in answer to 'The Lover's
                     Lament'?"</p>
                  <p>"Ask the editor and publisher," he said; "for they both had my true name."</p>
                  <p>"And have <emph>you</emph> kept up the correspondence ever since?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, with the help of sister Kate, who did the copying, and, if you hadn't
                     been as blind as a bat, you would have recognized her hand.</p>
                  <p>"Here," he continued, drawing a large packet of letters from beneath his shawl,
                     "are the answers: they are capital!" And a glance confirmed his words: they
                     were indeed the affectionate missives which I had sent my fair unknown.</p>
                  <p>Reader, if I had been a boa-constrictor at that moment, I should certainly have
                     swallowed Billy Wentworth, hat, frock, and all; but, Nature having denied me
                     the capability, I refrained from the attempt. I made several wry mouths in the
                     way of laughing; but there was no mirth at heart, for I was cruelly
                     disappointed.</p>
                  <p>"Billy," said I at last, with a tolerable degree of composure, "it's a good
                     joke; but I think you have been rather hard upon me."</p>
                  <p>"Not at all," replied he; "for just think, what, in all probability, I have
                     saved you from. If it had been in reality a lady who had answered your letters,
                     she could have been none other than a bold, designing person; for no true lady
                     would ever have adopted such a method of urging herself upon a gentleman's
                     attention; neither would she have followed it up, even if he had made the first
                     advances, without becoming previously and personally acquainted with her
                     correspondent. You, however, were too blind to consider this, and committed
                     yourself beyond recall. Suppose, now, that when you came here to-night, instead
                     of your affectionate cousin you had met with a homely, disagreeable old maid,
                     who had victimized you for her own interest, without the least regard to your
                     happiness: what then? Why, you would have been obliged either to submit quietly
                     to your fate, or to beat a most dishonorable retreat. Now, instead of putting
                     on such a rueful countenance about it, Cousin Earnest, thank Heaven that it is
                     no worse, and learn wisdom for the future."</p>
                  <p>I had a sufficient degree of common sense left to feel the force of Billy's
                     remarks, although at the same time I was very ungrateful for the lesson he had
                     taught me. He was several years older than myself, possessed of much genius,
                     and engaged to a beautiful and accomplished lady. Upon reflection, I felt that
                     he could not sympathize with me, and I turned silently and coldly away.</p>
                  <p>"Look here, Earnest," said he, in his winning, goodnatured way, as he laid his
                     hand upon my arm. "I can't have you offended with me, for I intended no wrong.
                     It is true, I think you are somewhat of a simpleton; but at heart I know you to
                     be a good fellow: therefore I can not bear to see you make a fool of yourself.
                     This finding of one's own true counterpart is no light or trifling matter. If
                     you once get your head into the matrimonial noose, and find you don't like it,
                     the harder you pull, the closer it will draw and the more<pb n="12-13"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000007"/> painfully it will choke. Therefore be very
                     careful, in the first place, how you get into the difficulty. Take my advice.
                     Apply your mind to some definite course of study, which will bring out the
                     talents that are in you, ripen your judgment, and establish you as a man; then
                     you will be fitted to choose wisely and well, and I have no doubt, that, acting
                     under such influences, you will find the future Mrs. Maywood all you could
                     desire her."</p>
                  <p>I felt convinced of the truth of his reasoning. Somehow, a broader and deeper
                     view of life was unfolded to me at that very moment; and, notwithstanding my
                     disappointment, his words inspired nobler purposes and brighter hopes in my
                     heart.</p>
                  <p>"You are right, Billy," said I with much sincerity. "In return for your
                     compliment to me, I will say that I consider you an arrant rogue, but will give
                     you credit for much practical good sense. And now, my dear Myra," I continued,
                     as I politely offered my arm, "shall I have the pleasure of waiting upon you
                     home?"</p>
                  <p>"Not in this plight, beloved Earnest," replied Billy; and quickly divesting
                     himself of his female apparel, he rolled up the dress and shawl, and stuffing
                     them into the hat, tied the strings tightly over them. Hanging the novel
                     work-basket on his arm, he drew his own much-injured <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >chapeau</foreign> from a neighboring thorn-bush, and taking my arm, we
                     walked home in friendly converse together.</p>
                  <p>Acting from the new impulse which I had received, I soon took my departure for
                     New York, where I commenced a course of solid reading and study, which soon led
                     me to look with shame and contempt upon my former mer frivolous pursuits. About
                     this time, however, I became acquainted with a young man by the name of Jasper
                     Vassalvane, who was making no small stir in society, on account of his peculiar
                     views and his originality in thought and expression. He was what is properly
                     termed "a leading mind;" for, before his interested listener was aware, he
                     would induct him into his own train of thought, and, by a species of
                     psychological sympathy, make him see things in the same light with himself. The
                     definition which "Novalis" has given of a character, as being "a completely
                     fashioned will," found its true application in him. He was also transcendental
                     in the highest sense of the word,—delighted in abstract thought and
                     metaphysical reasoning, and devoured with intellectual eagerness the most
                     abstruse works of the German philosophers. My morbid nature craved precisely
                     such an associate, and, after a few weeks' acquaintance, I followed him as
                     closely as ever a dog followed his master.</p>
                  <p>It was from him that I first learned the doctrine of "affinities," which has
                     since become quite popular; and my mind was soon laboring under a sense of my
                     halfness,—the incompleteness of my being, without that counterpart of myself
                     which was to make up the sum total of a compound individuality, and form an
                     indissoluble union throughout the ages of eternity. Whether that consecrated
                     being, whom, according to my theory, divine Providence had destined for me, and
                     none other, was yet living upon the face of the earth, or had been removed by
                     some of the accidents which flesh is heir to, to a higher sphere, I could not
                     tell. Moreover, important as it would seem that every true seeker should find
                     his own<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6310-00000008"/> affinity; that he should not
                     "ask a <emph>miss</emph>" in his innocence and ignorance, and, when his prayer
                     was granted, find it a <emph>misstake</emph> (forgive me, reader, for this
                     accidental pun upon a serious subject),—yet Providence for once seemed to have
                     made an important oversight in not affording a sure test for deciding this
                     momentous question.</p>
                  <p>In the midst of my doubts and difficulties, I applied to my friend, and he
                     informed me, after some reflection, that he had an impression that my affinity
                     was still living, and that I should meet her accidentally in the streets of the
                     city. So great was the influence he had gained over me, that I had as much
                     faith in this impression as if it were a divine revelation; and, inspired by
                     the confidence which it gave me, I sallied forth several times a day, and after
                     walking through a number of the principal streets, I would turn into courts,
                     alleys, byways, and all sorts of out-of-the-way places. I also intruded my
                     head, like a reconnoitring thief, in at shop-doors of confectioners, milliners,
                     ice-cream saloons, and dry-goods merchants; took numberless rides in crazy
                     omnibuses and crowded street-cars; frequented various places of evening
                     amusements, and attended a different place of worship every sabbath, but all in
                     vain. If at any time I had met my affinity, she did not seem to be governed by
                     the usual law of attraction, for not one of the innumerable host of females
                     which I had encountered seemed in the least magnetically influenced toward
                     me.</p>
                  <p>It did occur to me at times, that perhaps my personal appearance might act as a
                     preventive; for I had become a "mannerist" in dress and externals, and, from
                     the consideration that human eyes were upon me, affected a thousand moods which
                     I did not really feel. Thus I became artificial and unnatural, and lost that
                     ease and dignity which so truly become an intellectual, independent man. I
                     allowed my beard and hair to grow in any way which Nature in her freakishness
                     would have them. After infinite trouble among sensible and conscientious
                     tailors, I managed to get my garments cut in the oddest of fashions, and I
                     never went into the street without giving my hat an extra poke in the side, and
                     pinch at the top, by way of finishing touches. I put myself to no small trouble
                     to dress and conduct thus, for three particular reasons: first, I wished people
                     to know that I paid not the least attention to externals; second, that an
                     extraordinary man could not be ordinary in appearance; and third, as I
                     afterwards discovered, I unconsciously desired to attract attention and
                     admiration by my eccentricities. I knew that others before me had succeeded by
                     such a course, and I asked myself, "Why should not I?" I did not reflect,
                     however, that the peculiarities of those individuals whom I strove to imitate
                     had their foundation in character and natural proclivity, while with me it was
                     a mere affectation, and lacked that charm which genius and originality ever
                     give to such things.</p>
                  <p>It happened one morning, as I was rushing up Broadway, with my cane under one
                     arm and a volume of philosophy under the other, as if in pursuit of a fugitive
                     idea, that I encountered an old friend of mine, Nicholas Fairfax, who had long
                     been a resident in the city, but whom I had not seen for something more than a
                     year. He was a middle-aged man, very philanthropic, calm,<pb n="16-17"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000009"/> and dignified. He seldom used any extravagant
                     forms of speech or excess of language, but always spoke his mind with a
                     plainness which did not admit of the slightest misunderstanding. He did not
                     appear to recognize me, and was about passing when I saluted him.</p>
                  <p>"Gracious goodness!" he exclaimed, stopping short, and contemplating me with
                     unfeigned astonishment,—"Maywood, is that you? Why, I should much sooner have
                     taken you for a German professor of music, or a returned Californian. What in
                     the name of common sense has induced you to make such an appearance? Have you
                     become a Jew, or made a solemn vow not to be shaven or shorn till you find the
                     future Mrs. Maywood?</p>
                  <p>"Look here, my dear boy," he continued, as he took me by the beard, and looked
                     me directly in the face, "there isn't a sensible woman in the whole universe
                     who would be willing to marry such a nondescript as you are at present. Why,
                     you look much more like a baboon, or a horned owl, than a sensible human being.
                     If you have any regard for yourself or friends, or desire the love and
                     companionship of any respectable woman, go and make yourself look more like a
                     rational man, directly."</p>
                  <p>After a few more words of friendly conversation we separated, but he had thrown
                     out a suggestion I could not forget; and I came to the conclusion, at last,
                     that the appearance of my outer man had really hindered my success in seeking
                     for my affinity. I acted upon the conviction immediately. Dropping into a
                     fashionable barber's, I engaged him to cut and arrange my hair in the latest
                     and most approved style; also to take off the larger portion of my beard,
                     leaving only a respectable pair of whiskers and a modest mustache. Next, I
                     arrayed myself in a new suit from top to toe, and purchased a hat perfectly
                     faultless as far as form and fashion were concerned. Thus metamorphosed, I
                     surveyed myself before the mirror, and although of a nervous temperament, small
                     in stature, and by no means plump in person, I had the vanity to think that I
                     was quite a good-looking fellow.</p>
                  <p>Toward evening, I sallied forth again upon another affinity-hunting expedition.
                     Feeling that I could pursue no definite course with such an object in view, I
                     sauntered leisurely onward till I came to the Battery. It was a most glorious
                     sunset; and the harbor seemed literally alive with the various craft which were
                     gliding over the crimson and golden waves. A stately merchantship was just
                     coming into port, and formed a prominent object in the scene. I leaned over the
                     railing, and watched her progress with interest. Not far from me stood a young
                     woman, holding a little girl in her arms, who also seemed to be observing the
                     ship. As the child was large, she relieved the lady of a part of her weight, by
                     resting her feet upon the top of the railing.</p>
                  <p>"You, aunty," said the observant little one, "whose great ship is that
                     yonder?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I don't know," replied the lady carelessly: "it belongs to some man, I
                     suppose."</p>
                  <p>The child seemed unwilling to give up the question, and, stretching out her
                     little hand toward me, called out, "You, man, is that your ship?"</p>
                  <p>"No, little one," I replied: "all the ships I own sail in the air, and get
                     wrecked against every passing cloud."</p>
                  <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6310-00000010"/>
                  <p>The child turned her large blue eyes upon me with a questioning glance, and the
                     lady smiled,—a sad, sweet smile, such as only visits the faces of those who
                     have been disciplined by sorrow and a trying experience.</p>
                  <p>"Is that one of your ships, up there?" asked the child, pointing to a light
                     cloud which was floating through the ether, all radiant with the crimson glory
                     of the sunset.</p>
                  <p>"Hush, Minnie!" said the lady in a tone of gentle reproof. "You are troublesome
                     to the gentleman with your questions."</p>
                  <p>"Not at all," I replied. "The thoughts of such little ones, however simply
                     expressed, are full of freshness and originality. Music, flowers, and little
                     children are a divinely appointed trinity, to remind man of the peace, beauty,
                     and innocence of his eternal home."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you, sir, for that sentiment," replied the lady, with modest sincerity:
                     "you have spoken my thought precisely,—a thought for which I have ever lacked
                     suitable words of expression."</p>
                  <p>Once more we turned our attention to the ship; and then, how it happened I can
                     not tell, but by an unguarded movement on the part of the little one, her feet
                     slipped, and she fell directly into the yielding flood. A simultaneous shriek
                     burst from the lips of the lady. Without a moment's reflection, I sprang
                     quickly over the railing (for which act my early exercises had well qualified
                     me), and, as the child rose to the surface, I caught hold of her. Assistance
                     from every quarter was immediately extended to me, and in a few moments I had
                     the pleasure of restoring the little one again to her relative. Beyond being
                     thoroughly drenched and frightened, the little one was in other respects
                     unharmed. I procured them a hack immediately, and after receiving an invitation
                     from the lady to call and see the mother of her little charge, together with a
                     card on which was written the street and number of her residence, I returned to
                     my own lodgings.</p>
                  <p>Here, as I reflected upon my singular adventure, I came to the decided
                     conclusion that I had at length met with the long-sought-for object. I looked
                     at the card. The name upon it was Faith Anderson. It was peculiar; but I did
                     not object to it. "Why should I?" was the question I asked myself. If she
                     proves to be a true Faith, one that will not fail me either in joy or sorrow,
                     and upon which I can found my fairest hope of happiness, her name will be
                     possessed of such significance that it will ever be harmonious in my ears.</p>
                  <p>I could not wait for the morrow. That very evening, at eight o'clock, I rang at
                     the door of the dwelling where so many hopes of my heart were already centered.
                     I gave my card to the servant, and was ushered into a pleasant,
                     neatly-furnished parlor. Faith herself rose from the piano to welcome me; and I
                     was introduced to the parents of the rescued little one. I was so cordially
                     received, that I felt myself at home directly; and as time passed on, what with
                     the animated and interesting conversation, Faith's playing and singing, and the
                     cheerful influences which seemed to pervade the very atmosphere of the room, I
                     felt that I had never passed a more delightful evening. When I parted with
                     them, it was with regret that my visit was so soon over; and they too seemed to
                     feel the same: for they urged me, most earnestly, to call again.</p>
                  <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6310-00000011"/>
                  <p>Of course, I availed myself of the invitation, hardly waiting for a proper
                     interval of time to elapse. About this time, I procured a bottle of hair-oil,
                     with which I plentifully deluged my hair and whiskers; carried a white silk
                     handkerchief, perfumed with ottar of roses; purchased a pair of light kid
                     gloves, and a gold watchkey; became very particular about the appearance of my
                     linen; wore gold studs and sleeve-buttons,—well, to tell the truth, I was in
                     imminent danger of falling quickly over from "mannerism" into the opposite
                     extreme of dandyism. At every succeeding visit, I became more interested in
                     Faith, who seemed the perfect incarnation of my hitherto ideal counterpart. Her
                     quiet grace and gentle dignity of manner were wholly unaffected; and the serene
                     expression of her countenance stilled the fitful flutterings of my heart, and
                     exerted a peaceful influence over my whole being.</p>
                  <p>Suffice it to say that I wooed her with all the passionate ardor of my nature;
                     for I had not the slightest shadow of a doubt that she was my true affinity. I
                     wooed and won her. Six months after our first interview, Faith Anderson became
                     my wife. My friend Vassalvane was present at the bridal; and, at the first
                     opportunity, I asked him what his impressions were concerning my affinity, and,
                     more particularly, if he thought our union would endure throughout eternity. He
                     said that, as far as he could see, he thought it would; and, in my infatuation,
                     I fondly believed that my friend Vassalvane's vision was without
                     limitation.</p>

                  <head type="sub">I DISCOVER MY MISTAKE.</head>
                  <p>THUS far, I have been quite minute in detail, from a desire to give the reader
                     a fair understanding of my aims and character. Allow me now to pass over a
                     period of some ten years from the time of my marriage. The small but
                     comfortable fortune which my father left me had long since been expended in my
                     endeavors to do all, and a little more, than my wife desired. At last I was
                     obliged to seek employment, and soon obtained an excellent situation as a clerk
                     in a dry-goods store. The salary was sufficient for our need, if we practiced
                     economy; but the employment was so little suited to my taste, that I became
                     disgusted with it. Nevertheless, I was obliged to persevere; for our family was
                     becoming large and expensive. Twice, heaven had blessed us with a pair of
                     twins; and, at the end of the ten years, I counted seven little ones around my
                     table. I will confess, as far as my children were concerned, that what I gained
                     in quantity I lost in quality, for they were all fretful, sickly, nervous
                     creatures. As we could not afford to hire help, my wife was all worn out with
                     domestic duties. She was low-spirited, and her health miserable: in fact, she
                     was burdened more heavily than her human nature could bear, and was sinking
                     slowly beneath it. My light employment in the store did not weary me much
                     through the day; and at night, as my wife had no leisure time to interest or
                     entertain me as she had done formerly, I went away to some literary or
                        scientific<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6310-00000012"/> lecture, to a
                     reading-room or a concert, and thus managed, not only to refresh myself, but to
                     improve my mind, and to keep up with the progressive spirit of the times.</p>
                  <p>Often when I went home at ten or eleven o'clock at night, I would find Faith
                     sewing upon some old garment which was much the worse for wear, or holding a
                     crying child in her arms. It is true, that, under the circumstances, she was
                     very patient and uncomplaining; but then she did not smile as formerly, and was
                     not as interesting in conversation. In fact, she began to betray very sensibly
                     that lack of general information which I could so easily obtain, but from which
                     she was hindered by the multiplicity of her cares. I did not consider this,
                     however, but began to grow discontented, more especially when some one of the
                     children cried all night with an ache or an ail, as often happened; or perhaps
                     two or three of them had the whooping-cough. I proposed sleeping up stairs, to
                     which Faith readily acceded; and thus I secured to myself comfortable rest,
                     nights, while she kept her wearisome vigils below.</p>
                  <p>As matters continued thus, we became still more disunited in feeling. At
                     length, Faith, in the loneliness and desolation of her heart, sought the only
                     refuge which was open to her, save the grave itself. To use a common
                     expression, she "experienced religion" and joined a church. She previously
                     asked my consent, and, as I did not wish to play the tyrant, I gave it; but my
                     friend Vassalvane did not believe in such things, therefore I did not. The
                     secret suspicion which I had long entertained now deepened into a conviction. I
                     felt certain that I had been laboring under a great mistake take, and that,
                     when I married Faith Anderson, I had not found my true affinity. It was
                     exceedingly unfortunate; for now, what could I do?</p>
                  <p>At this juncture, my friend Vassalvane returned from a lecturing-tour, and, as
                     usual, I applied to him in my difficulty. After hearing my partial and
                     one-sided statement of the case, he shook his head wisely.</p>
                  <p>"I see how it is," he said. "Although I would hardly have believed it, yet
                     circumstances have proved that you are certainly mismated; otherwise she could
                     not thus have grown apart from you."</p>
                  <p>"But what can I do?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"Do?" he replied: "I shall not advise you. You can readily see, however, that,
                     by leaving matters as they are, you are not only keeping yourself from
                        <emph>your</emph> true affinity, but Faith, also, from the one for whom
                     Providence designed her, which is an evident injustice."</p>
                  <p>"But the children?" I suggested.</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" he continued, "that is unfortunate; but then they are the offspring of
                     error, and therefore will be of but little account in the world, as harmonious
                     children only come of true affinities. You must dispose of them to the best
                     advantage, and leave it to the Allwise Father to provide as he may see fit for
                     their temporal and eternal happiness."</p>
                  <p>I went away perfectly contented with this piece of pious advice, but did not
                     find it easy to put it in practice. My conscience smote me as I looked in
                     Faith's pale, wasted countenance; and when I saw how tenderly she cared for the
                     little ones, and how they clung to her, as though she alone was the grand
                     center of their hopes and childish joys, I felt that it would break her heart
                        should<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6310-00000013"/> I dare make such a monstrous
                     proposition to her as I was then revolving in my mind. Yet what erring mortal
                     is there that can not understand me, when I say, that, with my treacherous
                     inclination at heart, I looked the error in the face so long, that finally it
                     seemed like the right itself, and I felt that it was my painful duty to carry
                     it into practice. A trifling matter at length decided me.</p>
                  <p>One day, while waiting upon the customers, as usual, two ladies entered the
                     store; and the personal appearance of one attracted my attention immediately.
                     She was not handsome; but there was a peculiar charm in the continued light and
                     shadow of feeling which played over her expressive countenance, and beamed from
                     her large, dark eyes. Never had I looked upon a face which spoke such volumes
                     in itself. Her bearing and movement betrayed at once to my searching eye a
                     decided and original character. While I was attending to other customers, the
                     two ladies seated themselves, and continued their conversation. I listened
                     attentively to every word. Her voice was firm and sweet, and her remarks clear
                     and forcible. Moreover, when she addressed me in order to make her purchases, I
                     discovered in her a most praiseworthy virtue, which all women do not
                     possess,—that of knowing precisely what she wanted, and desiring nothing else.
                     Before they left, another lady entered; and the moment she beheld the
                     countenance of my fair unknown, she exclaimed, "Why, Grace Thorndale! I am
                     delighted to see you! How long have you been in the city?"</p>
                  <p>"Only a few weeks," was the reply, "and I return to H—— to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>"Then you are still residing in H——?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes! and I see no good reason why I should not continue there the rest of
                     my days."</p>
                  <p>"Unless you should chance to get married," laughingly returned her friend.</p>
                  <p>"Of which there is not the slightest danger," was the immediate reply.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, don't be so sure of that, Grace!" said her friend. "You ought to hear what
                     Vassalvane says on that subject. He tells us that every one has his or her
                     affinity, and that sooner or later, in the course of time or eternity, they
                     will be united."</p>
                  <p>"Then I shall wait till mine comes to me," was the reply; and they all went
                     out.</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" I said within myself, "and what if <emph>I</emph> should prove to be your
                     affinity, Grace Thorndale, and a mysterious Providence had sent you hither to
                     inspire my soul to action?"</p>
                  <p>Her last words seemed to me like the speech of an oracle. "Will she indeed wait
                     till I come?" I asked; and I revolved this question in my mind night and day. I
                     became a complete monomaniac on the subject, and my Faith seemed more distant
                     from me than ever. She, poor soul, read her Bible and prayed; and to her it was
                     an infinite consolation, while I mocked at it; for, as I before said, my friend
                     Vassalvane did not believe in such things.</p>
                  <p>Finally, I became so wearied and oppressed by my contending emotions, that I
                     applied to Vassalvane for advice, and he told me "<emph>to follow my
                        impressions of right,</emph>" which was quite equal to telling me to follow
                     my nose; for my "sense of right" had become entirely subjected to my
                     inclinations. After going through with<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6310-00000014"/>
                     the farce of consulting my conscience, I determined to take advantage of my
                     approaching vacation—a generous period of six weeks—to visit H——, and look up
                     Grace Thorndale. When the time arrived, I informed my wife that I intended
                     taking a journey; and she, in the kindness of her heart, believing that my
                     health required it, assented at once, although I should leave her with scarce
                     money enough to supply her necessities till my return. She worked early and
                     late to prepare my wardrobe, and at last bade me farewell with the tears of
                     affection in her eyes.</p>
                  <p>My heart sickens as I reflect upon the insane course of conduct I pursued after
                     arriving at H——, in order to make the acquaintance of this strange lady. It is
                     enough for me to say that I did so without exciting her suspicions, and became
                     a visitor at her house. She seemed to be living in very easy circumstances,
                     with her mother and sister. Her father was absent on a tour in Europe. Grace
                     Thorndale, I found, was the star of the circle in which she moved; and, as I
                     was of an ambitious turn, I felt that to win such a prize would be no small
                     honor. I exerted every power of my nature, and soon found that I had interested
                     her. I was possessed of an oily tongue; when I chose had a pleasing address;
                     and felt a certain confidence in my own ability, which is one of the essentials
                     to success. I resolved, however, not to offer myself to her before conferring
                     with my wife; and, if Faith consented to a divorce, I would state to Grace
                     Thorndale the case precisely as it was, leaving her then to act from her own
                     judgment.</p>
                  <p>At the end of the six weeks, I took my departure from H—— with a most decided
                     conviction that I had only to offer myself in order to be accepted. I promised,
                     in answer to the entreaties of the whole family, that I would return again in
                     the course of three months, as I hoped, by that time, to have matters all
                     arranged with Faith. It was several weeks though, before I could look my wife
                     in the face, and make that selfish proposition.</p>
                  <p>One evening, however, when the little ones were all asleep, I summoned courage.
                     I first laid before her the whole doctrine of "affinities," and discoursed, at
                     some length, upon the awful consequences which resulted to parents and
                     children, and society in general, from mistaken marriages. She listened to me
                     patiently, only venturing one remark, which, at the time, I considered trivial,
                     and childish in the extreme.</p>
                  <p>"Strange!" she said, "that the Lord should not have arranged matters in the
                     first place, or given his creatures sufficient wisdom, so as to prevent the
                     world from ever getting into such a muss."</p>
                  <p>Since that time, I have concluded that there was some slight sarcasm in her
                     words, although I did not then detect it.</p>
                  <p>After having thus prefaced the main proposition, I told her I had at length
                     come to the conclusion that we were not true affinities, and that for our
                     sakes, and for the sake of the little ones, I felt it was best we should
                     separate. I turned my face from her as I said this, for I feared she might
                     weep, and I wished to spare myself; for it always made me feel unpleasantly. I
                     waited for her to reply; but she did not.</p>
                  <p>After a few moments of silence, I told her what I proposed doing with the
                     children, which was, to scatter the youngest among our relatives, and put out
                     the two eldest<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6310-00000015"/> (twin sisters) into
                     separate wealthy families, where they could take care of the smaller children
                     in return for their board.</p>
                  <p>"Earnest!" she exclaimed, with an energy I never knew was in her composition,
                     "if <emph>you</emph> want to leave me and our children, <emph>go!</emph> But as
                     for me, so long as these little ones, who are bone of our bone and flesh of our
                     flesh, are in existence, I will stand by them at all events, and never,
                        <emph>never,</emph> NEVER forsake them."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <head type="sub">"A LION IN THE WAY."</head>
                  <p>FOR some weeks after my conversation with Faith, I did not allude again to the
                     subject, for her vehemence upon that evening alarmed me; but, as the time
                     approached for my second visit to H——, I became anxious, and finally laid the
                     proposition again before my wife.</p>
                  <p>"Earnest," she answered, with a pale face, but a firm voice, "I have told you,
                     that, if you wished to go, you could. The Lord will be my helper; and, if the
                     father of my little ones will not provide for them, I will appeal to the
                     charities of the world."</p>
                  <p>I saw at once that I could not expect a calm and rational consideration of the
                     subject from her, and therefore applied to the oracular Vassal vane. After
                     considering the matter long and carefully, he told, me that "if I felt there
                     was a strong reason why I should go, to <emph>go;</emph> and if I felt there
                     was a strong reason why I should stay, to <emph>stay.</emph>" I was greatly
                     obliged to him; for I took the first part of his advice into consideration, and
                     found it so forcible, that I wholly overlooked the last, and accordingly
                     started for H—— without saying any thing further to my wife.</p>
                  <p>My reception by the Thorndale family was as cordial as I could have
                        <emph>expected,</emph> although not exactly what I <emph>wished.</emph> I
                     had resolved, at the first favorable opportunity, to throw myself entirely upon
                     the womanly sympathies of Grace, and plead my cause upon the very ground of my
                     unfortunate circumstances.</p>
                  <p>A convenient season soon offered itself; for, upon calling one evening, I found
                     her at home alone. I immediately seated myself by her side; and, telling her
                     that I wished to have a conversation with her, I took her hand. She instantly
                     withdrew it, and, like a discreet woman remarked, "that, if I had any thing to
                     say, I could do so without personal contact." As I had previously done with
                     Faith, I unfolded to Grace the doctrine of affinities, explained my unfortunate
                     situation, assured her that I was quite certain she was my true affinity, and
                     ended by making her a formal offer of my hand and heart. As for fortune, I
                     humbly informed her I had none.</p>
                  <p>Through the whole of my speech, she did not make one word of reply, but sat
                     with folded arms, listening attentively. I never shall forget the singular
                     expression of her eyes as she regarded me. They did not smile or look angry;
                     but there was something very peculiar in them. She sat motionless, with her
                     head bent forward, and her eyelids slightly drooping, leaving only a sharp,<pb
                        n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6310-00000016"/> black line of sight, from which she
                     regarded me, like an old feudal baron observing his enemy from the loop-holes
                     in a watch-tower. Even after I had been silent several moments, she did not
                     speak; and I began to feel greatly embarrassed.</p>
                  <p>"Grace," said I at length, in order to relieve myself,</p>
                  <p>"what do you say to all this?"</p>
                  <p>"Upon what grounds could you procure a divorce?" she asked, as if carefully
                     considering the subject.</p>
                  <p>"I do not know exactly," I replied; "and, in the present undeveloped state of
                     society, I may not succeed in that undertaking at all: but, if I do not, I
                     shall feel that we then have a right to throw ourselves back upon the higher
                     law of our being, and, regardless of that civil code which has so long
                     restrained the God-given liberties of the human soul, act according to the
                     dictates of Nature and our own intuitions."</p>
                  <p>"By that means," she said, "we should render ourselves liable to a legal
                     process upon an accusation which would not be very complimentary to the
                     character of either of us."</p>
                  <p>"That is true," I replied; "and therefore the best course for us to pursue
                     would be to depart immediately to some distant portion of the country, where we
                     shall be safe from such troublesome interference."</p>
                  <p>"To Salt Lake?" she briefly suggested.</p>
                  <p>I glanced at her sharply; but I saw nothing in her countenance which seemed to
                     oppose my proposition.</p>
                  <p>"No," I answered: "I should not fancy that; for, like Abraham of old, I might
                     be compelled to call you my sister, lest some of those old Mormon saints or
                     elders should slay me in order to take you at once into their harem."</p>
                  <p>"Does your wife freely consent to your present course of conduct?" she
                     inquired.</p>
                  <p>"Not entirely," I replied; "but I think she objects chiefly on account of the
                     children. She has the natural feelings of a mother, which no consideration for
                     a high philosophical principle can teach her to overcome. Her mind has not
                     partaken of the progressive spirit of the age, and therefore she will not
                     consent to a separation from them. I think, however, that if matters could be
                     so arranged that she could remain with them, and by some suitable employment be
                     able to maintain them, she would be tolerably well contented."</p>
                  <p>"Then she does not object at all that you should follow <emph>your</emph>
                     inclinations. Is it because she has found her own affinity, and therefore will
                     not feel the loss?"</p>
                  <p>"Well—no—but gradually her feelings have <emph>somehow</emph> become estranged
                     from me."</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" said Grace, with a deprecating shake of her head, "that does not speak
                     well for a woman who has a kind, affectionate husband,—one who is willing not
                     only to share the mutual burdens, but to relieve her, as far as possible, of
                     her particular weight of responsibility. If you had been neglectful and
                     inconsiderate, and sought your own interest apart from hers, one could not
                     wonder. But then I am not to suppose that of you."</p>
                  <p>My conscience intimated very strongly that she might suppose it with justice;
                     but I did not think it advisable to say so. I felt, however, that it would be
                     good policy to bring our conference to as speedy a termination as possible; for
                     I feared every moment that I should betray some inconsistency in my
                     reasoning.</p>
                  <p>"Well, my dear Grace," I said at length, somewhat<pb n="32-33"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000017"/> abruptly, "what is the conclusion of the whole
                     matter? Am I to hope? or am I not?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" she replied, without a moment's hesitation, "I have already decided, and
                     I refer you at once to my father. He has returned from Europe, but has been
                     absent for the last few days in the city. He will be at home to-morrow,
                     however; and then, if you will call at night, you can see him. You will find
                     him to be a just, upright, and high-principled man, with a clear intellect,
                     sound judgment, and an uncorrupted heart. Please state your case to him
                     precisely as you have done to me. He will give you an attentive hearing; will
                     take your well-being and mine into consideration: and I have sufficient
                     confidence in him to say, that, whatever his decision may be, I shall consider
                     it as best, and abide by it entirely.</p>
                  <p>"You will please excuse me," she continued, "for saying, moreover, that at
                     present I have an engagement, which I must fulfill, and therefore our
                     conversation must come to an end."</p>
                  <p>I felt loath to depart, especially when such a great hope was kindled within
                     me; but, with the usual ease and dignity which were so becoming to her, she
                     arose, and passed me my hat.</p>
                  <p>"Dear girl!" I exclaimed, as I pressed her hand warmly upon the threshold, "not
                     thus shall we part tomorrow night. The day shall be one of sweet anticipation;
                     but the 'dewy eve' shall bring with it a blissful certainty."</p>
                  <p>She did not respond to my rhapsody; but I considered this freedom from all
                     enthusiasm and excitement as one of her most beautiful characteristics. It is
                     true, that, while pursuing my way to my lodgings, I had some misgivings about
                     presenting my singular plea to her father; for I knew that men, and especially
                     those who were old and experienced, were not apt to look upon matters and
                     things in the same light as a woman in love would, and therefore he might be
                     more inclined to censure, than to aid my suit. I did not let this thought
                     dampen my ardor, however, but the next evening, at a proper hour, started for
                     the Thorndale mansion.</p>
                  <p>Upon being ushered into the parlor, I found Grace there alone. She received me
                     with her usual courtesy and kindness, and then, stepping into the next room,
                     returned immediately with a very tall, elderly gentleman, of the regular
                     General Jackson stamp, or "Old Hickory" order, whom she introduced as her
                     father. Being extremely sensitive, the spheres of certain people influenced me
                     greatly, and this gentleman's approach completely overwhelmed me. I felt like a
                     pygmy in the presence of a giant, or more like a puppet in a handorgan, and
                     longed that some one should pull the wires, or wind up the machinery, in order
                     to set me in motion. Grace immediately left the room.</p>
                  <p>"Be seated, sir," said Mr. Thorndale, courteously, but with great dignity.</p>
                  <p>I sat down like an obedient schoolboy, and endeavored to collect my scattered
                     senses. The father of my beloved placed his chair directly in front of me.
                     After seating himself, he leaned back, put his thumbs in either arm-hole of his
                     vest, crossed his legs, and, looking directly at me, said in a polite but
                     straightforward manner,—</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir, my daughter informs me that you desire<pb n="34-35"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000018"/> a brief conversation with me: what have you to
                     say?"</p>
                  <p>I was painfully aware just then that I had <emph>nothing</emph> to say. The
                     words came up to my lips, but rolled back again like pebble-stones, and dropped
                     heavily upon my heart. I made a mighty effort at self-control, and partially
                     recovered myself.</p>
                  <p>"I am aware, sir," I commenced, "that the proposition which I have to make is
                     somewhat extraordinary; but, if you will first allow me to explain, you may see
                     the whole subject in the same light as I do."</p>
                  <p>"Go on, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps," I continued, "your daughter has already informed you concerning this
                     matter."</p>
                  <p>"She has told me nothing, save that you desired to speak with me. Go on,
                     sir."</p>
                  <p>I commenced at once upon the subject of affinities, and defined it as clearly
                     and forcibly as possible; but, when I came to the main proposition, I
                     hesitated.</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir," he said, perceiving my embarrassment, and conjecturing the cause,
                     "am I to consider this discourse upon affinities as a preface to a proposal for
                     my daughter's hand?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir," I replied sheepishly. "I have already spoken with her, and she
                     referred me to you, resting the whole matter upon your decision."</p>
                  <p>"Please, then," he said in the most direct manner possible, "to inform me
                     concerning your family connections, your present position and circumstances,
                     and your future prospects in life."</p>
                  <p>I fairly gasped for breath, but commenced unfolding the true state of affairs
                     to him as cautiously as possible. After much circumlocution, I at length
                     concluded, and the facts of the case were before him. I glanced timidly up to
                     see what effect my words had upon him, when, lo! there were the same
                     half-closed eyes and keenly searching gaze, which I had observed in his
                     daughter the night preceding.</p>
                  <p>"You say, sir," he commenced, after a brief interval of silence, "that you have
                     a wife and seven children now residing in the city of New York?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Has this companion of yours, whom you call Faith, been indeed a faithful wife,
                     and an affectionate mother to your children?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
                  <p>"But you say that in some way she has become alienated from you in feeling.
                     Please mention in what way."</p>
                  <p>"In a moral and intellectual way."</p>
                  <p>"Will you state first, sir, what you mean by a moral way?"</p>
                  <p>I hesitated, but finally managed to say, "She has experienced religion, and
                     joined a church, which, in these days of intellectual light and religious
                     liberty, seems to be a retrogression, and a blind adherence to the forms of the
                     past."</p>
                  <p>"Has she ever attended any of the reformatory lectures, or read the
                     philosophical and metaphysical works of the times?"</p>
                  <p>"No, sir: her mind was so completely absorbed in domestic concerns, that she
                     had no time for such things, even if she had the inclination. She only attended
                     church now and then on the sabbath, and, to tell the<pb n="36-37"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000019"/> truth, sir, her mind was not capable of
                     receiving any higher influences than those of religion."</p>
                  <p>"Very well. Now for the intellectual way."</p>
                  <p>"In this, sir," I replied somewhat triumphantly, "her mental condition is truly
                     lamentable. There are none of the popular scientific works, or poems by eminent
                     writers, with which she is in the least acquainted. Moreover, she is entirely
                     ignorant concerning the current news of the day. Railroad accidents, murders, a
                     failure in crops, political movements, and national disturbances, are all
                     unknown to her; therefore she is unable to converse even upon these
                     commonplace, every-day subjects."</p>
                  <p>"Do you ever sit down evenings to read the paper to her while she is busy with
                     her needle?"</p>
                  <p>"No, sir; for it often happens that the children are troublesome, and would
                     disturb me: therefore I usually read my paper in some club-room or
                     oyster-saloon."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Thorndale sprang from his chair, and commenced walking the room with long
                     and rapid strides.</p>
                  <p>"Look here, sir," he said at length, in a stern tone, as he stopped, and
                     regarded me with a look such as a schoolmaster would fix upon an offending
                     urchin. "If I had not studied human nature in all its phases, and therefore
                     learned to be charitable toward its weaknesses, I should give you a tremendous
                     shaking, and toss you out of the window. You have come hither, a married man,
                     and the father of seven children, to ask for my daughter's hand, upon the
                     ground that you have previously made a mistake, and now claim her as your
                     affinity. Even supposing for one moment I could grant your request, how should
                     I know but what, in less than one year from this time, you would find that you
                     had made another mistake, and start once more in search of your affinity? No.
                     If you have committed an error, all I can say is, in the name of all that is
                     high and holy, go home and make the best of it. The fault was your own;
                     therefore do not attempt to shirk the responsibility by shifting the burden
                     over upon the shoulders of your much-abused wife and innocent children. I would
                     not so far forget my dignity as to injure your miserable body; but I verily
                     believe, that, if you remain much longer in my presence, I shall be tempted to
                     visit you with a chastisement which a higher power can much more profitably
                     bestow upon your cowardly soul. Therefore, in all courtesy, I pray you to
                     depart."</p>
                  <p>"But your daughter's happiness," I ventured to suggest.</p>
                  <p>"My daughter's happiness!" he exclaimed. "Grace, come here!" And in a moment
                     she stood by her father's side.</p>
                  <p>"Look me in the face, child," he said, "and tell me if your happiness depends
                     in any way upon this miserable specimen of humanity."</p>
                  <p>"Not in the least," she replied calmly. "I only referred him to you from the
                     fear that I should not be able to do him or the subject justice."</p>
                  <p>"You have deceived me," I said, with much bitterness; "for your conduct
                     certainly gave me reason to hope."</p>
                  <p>"There has indeed been deception in this matter," she replied; "but
                        <emph>I</emph> shall not plead guilty to the charge. Had you, upon our first
                     acquaintance, informed me of your existing circumstances, and your intentions
                     concerning myself, then I should have conducted accordingly.</p>
                  <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6310-00000020"/>
                  <p>But you concealed these unfavorable circumstances from me in order to first
                     gain my affections, and then influence my better judgment through them. As far
                     as my conduct toward you is concerned, I have always treated you as I would any
                     gentleman who was polite and respectful in behavior, and against whose
                     character I knew nothing. My rule has ever been to treat all people with
                     confidence till they prove themselves unworthy; and, it matters not how many
                     times I may be deceived, Christian charity still compels me to abide by
                     it."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Thorndale took several more turns in the room, and again stopped before
                     me.</p>
                  <p>"Look here," he said, after a few moments' reflection, "I have come to the
                     conclusion (and you will excuse me for expressing myself so plainly) that you
                     are less of a knave than a fool. This doctrine of affinities, which you have so
                     eloquently and ingeniously advocated, is, at its foundation, true. Men and
                     women who thus sacredly unite their destinies for time—not to speak of
                     eternity—should be harmoniously related in the most interior principles of
                     their being, or the physical evils and crimes of which that union may be
                     productive, will, in coming time, rise up in judgment against them. There is,
                     however, no high principle or pure fact of philosophy introduced to the world,
                     but what is subject to perversion; and there are never wanting individuals with
                     seared consciences and selfish hearts (such as you, sir, I mean), who will 'use
                     their liberty as an occasion to the flesh,' mistaking the wanderings of desire,
                     or the caprices of their ill-balanced minds, for an attachment to principle. If
                     you can show me, sir, that you are as zealous in your adherence to other
                     philosophies that do not suit your pleasure or convenience, I shall believe in
                     your sincerity. Men and women about to enter upon such a relation should make
                     sure of the fitness and propriety of the act in the first place, and then
                     nothing save personal abuse, or an abandonment to disgusting and ruinous vices,
                     should break the holy bond. The only safe way is to qualify one's self early,
                     by an adherence to high and virtuous principle, for the making of a choice upon
                     which so much happiness depends, and, when it is once made, to abide by it
                     honestly and faithfully. That is all I have to say on the subject."</p>
                  <p>Whether I came at once under the psychological influence of this man's
                     well-balanced mind, or whether, by the power of conscience, I became convicted
                     of sin, I can not tell; but a sense of my own unworthiness came across me like
                     an overwhelming flood. I did not speak, because I had nothing to say. Rising, I
                     took my hat, and turned to depart.</p>
                  <p>"I hope, sir," said Mr. Thorndale, as he extended his hand to me with
                     gentlemanly courtesy, "that you will learn to think aright concerning this
                     matter, and allow it to have a corresponding effect upon your future
                     conduct."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you," was my brief reply.</p>
                  <p>Grace also offered her hand.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Maywood," she said seriously, and with evident sincerity, "give my love to
                     your wife, as I feel interested in her. Tell her, also, that, any time when she
                     desires rest and enjoyment, she will be most welcome here, and that she can
                     bring as man of the little ones as she pleases; for I am very fond of
                     children."</p>
                  <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6310-00000021"/>
                  <p>No human pen could describe my feelings, when, a few moments after, I stood
                     upon the lawn in front of that house, alone with my disappointment, shame, and
                     remorse. I looked up to the cloudless heavens, and the very stars seemed to
                     accuse me with their pure eyes of light. I bowed my guilty face to the earth,
                     and the night-winds, sighing among the trees, seemed to bring to my ears the
                     wailings of a deserted wife and suffering children. In my despair and anguish,
                     I beat my breast, and wept wildly. I believe, however, that those tears of
                     penitence brought to me a compassionate messenger from the throne of grace; for
                     something whispered me, "Thou art yet able to redeem the past, and, by a
                     patient continuance in well doing, to glorify thy whole future."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE CHASTENING HAND.</head>
                  <p>EARLY next morning, as I had previously resolved, I started for New York. I
                     expected to reach home by nightfall; but an accident delayed the train several
                     hours beyond the usual time. It was nearly eleven o'clock when we arrived. I
                     left my baggage at the dépôt, and pursued my way home on foot. As I came in
                     sight of my house, I observed quite a bright light in my wife's sleeping
                     apartment, and, upon approaching nearer, distinctly discerned the shadow of a
                     man's head upon the curtain. It was unmistakably a male profile;<unclear/>
                     there were the short, curling hair, large features and whiskers, which could
                     only belong to the genus <foreign xml:lang="LAT">homo.</foreign>
                     <unclear>I can</unclear> not describe the shock which this unexpected
                     appearance gave me. Astonishment, jealousy, rage, and revenge, all mingled in
                     one tumultuous whirl in my bosom.</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" said I to myself, so that hypocritical woman has been seeking out
                        <emph>her</emph> affinity, and thinks that her guilty secret will remain
                     undiscovered! But the just God, who judgeth in the earth, has revealed her
                     wickedness. Shame on a wife, and the mother of seven children, who can thus
                     disgrace herself!"</p>
                  <p>Reflection only increased my excitement, and prepared me for desperate deeds.
                     Had my cigar-case been a revolver, and my jack-knife a dagger, I should have
                     rushed in at once and done tremendous execution. But, with these articles as
                     they were, I could not effect much; and, moreover, prudence suggested that my
                     adversary might be a strong, powerful man, while I, on the contrary, was small,
                     and possessed little muscular energy: therefore I felt it was best to proceed
                     circumspectly. With my night-key I unlocked the door, and stepped in as
                     noiselessly as possible. The light was burning very dimly in the hall, and I
                     could distinctly hear voices at the top of the winding stairway. The first
                     words I could distinguish were those spoken by a male voice.</p>
                  <p>"Well, dear, I will just take a run home, to see how things are going on there,
                     and then return immediately."</p>
                  <p>"If you do," I whispered to myself, "you will return a dead man." But his
                     companion, who was evidently a female, wholly unconscious of the murderous
                     purpose in<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6310-00000022"/> the heart of him who stood
                     below, replied in an affectionate tone,—</p>
                  <p>"So do; and then you will remain here all night, won't you?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," was the brief response. And then he began to descend the stairs. My
                     heart beat like a drum at a military muster, as I watched him; but judge of my
                     astonishment, when, upon a nearer view. I discovered him to be my old friend,
                     Nicholas Fairfax. He started with surprise when he beheld me, which I construed
                     into a certain evidence of guilt.</p>
                  <p>"Villain!" I exclaimed, with more energy than I had ever before spoken that
                     word, "how dare you thus invade my domicile at this late hour, with your
                     infamous purpose?"</p>
                  <p>At the same time, I sprang forward, and, seizing his arm, shook it violently,
                     intending thereby to shake his whole body; but he stood as immovable as
                     Bunker-hill Monument.</p>
                  <p>"For heaven's sake, Mr. Maywood!" exclaimed some one, who ran quickly down
                     stairs, "don't make such a noise, even if you <emph>are</emph> glad to see
                     him."</p>
                  <p>Turning round quickly, I was surprised to behold Mrs. Fairfax herself, looking
                     extremely indignant.</p>
                  <p>"What does this mean?" I asked, as I stepped back in the utmost confusion.</p>
                  <p>"It means, Maywood," said my friend, "that your wife is dangerously ill. The
                     nurse and physician which we have procured for her are even now in her chamber.
                     As she is somewhat deranged, my wife and I intended to have remained here also;
                     but, since you have returned, it is unnecessary. After you had so basely
                     forsaken your Faith, leaving her and the little ones entirely unprovided for,
                     the cares and responsibilities of her situation overcame her, and she sank
                     beneath them. A good Providence, however, sent my wife hither at the right
                     time; and, since then, your family has been wanting in nothing which human care
                     and kindness could supply. I say not this boastfully, but I say it to your
                     shame; for you have ruined the health and happiness of as true a woman as God's
                     sun ever shone upon: and time may perhaps prove that you are also <emph>her
                        murderer.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>His words went like poisoned arrows to my heart. Overcome by a sense of my
                     guilt and utter worthlessness, I sank down upon my knees, and exclaimed,—</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my God, my God! be merciful to me a sinner!"</p>
                  <p>"I am glad to see," said Fairfax coldly, "that you have some feeling left; but
                     I advise you to leave praying with your lips at present, and go to praying with
                     your feet and hands. You are needed in the room up above there, by the side of
                     your sick wife. It may be that your presence can restore her to reason, and
                     perhaps to health; but her lost hours of rest and happiness you can never bring
                     back."</p>
                  <p>Bowed down with penitence and grief, I went up to my wife's room, and stood by
                     her bed. As I took her hand in my own, I observed it was so wasted, that the
                     flesh upon her slender fingers had shrunk away from the wedding-ring which she
                     still wore, leaving an ominous space between her finger and the golden circlet.
                     I kissed her pale cheek, and spoke to her with all my early tenderness; but she
                     did not know me. Turning away her head with a piteous moan, she stretched out
                     her arms, calling my name again and again.</p>
                  <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6310-00000023"/>
                  <p>"Oh!" she said, "will he never, never come? I can bear to have my own heart
                     broken; but God help my little children! When dear Katie fainted beneath her
                     hunger-pain, and little Faith looked up with her pale face, and said, 'Don't
                     cry, dear mother, father will come soon to bring us bread,' then my sorrows
                     crushed me. O God, forgive him! for he knows not what he has done."</p>
                  <p>Her words were too much for me. I buried my face in her pillow, and wept like a
                     child.</p>
                  <p>All that night, I sat by her bedside, only leaving her once, when a low wail
                     from one of the little flock above, in the upper chamber, reached my ear. I
                     took a light, and went up to them. Six of my little ones were there, disposed
                     about the room in their various cribs and trundle-beds, as the space would
                     admit. The infant—a child nearly a year old—the kind-hearted Mrs. Fair-fax had
                     wrapped in a blanket, and taken away with her. Only one was awake, and that one
                     was little Faith herself. I knelt down beside her bed to kiss her. The
                     affectionate child twined her slender arms around my neck, and pressing her
                     pale cheek to mine, all wet with tears, she whispered,—</p>
                  <p>"I <emph>knew,</emph> dear father, you would come back again. God told me so in
                     my heart, all the time."</p>
                  <p>A week passed on, during which period I divided my attention between Faith and
                     my flock of little ones. I did not shrink from any labor which domestic duty
                     required; but, like "a maid-of-all-work," I set my house in order, ministered
                     to the children's wants, and prepared all the food that was eaten. Sometimes,
                     at night, after a particularly toilsome day, I would experience such an
                     overpowering feeling of weariness, that I would long to lie down and die. Then
                     I wondered how it was that Faith had borne all this labor and care for so many
                     years, in addition to the weakness, the pains, and sicknesses of maternity. It
                     seemed to me a superhuman work, and I marveled that soul and body had not
                     yielded in despair.</p>
                  <p>At the end of the week, my wife could be safely pronounced better. The fever
                     had left her; her brow was once more moist and cool, and though utterly
                     prostrated by weakness, yet her mind was calm. I never shall forget how
                     earnestly she regarded me as I sat by her side, or how the tears gushed from
                     her eyes, when, kissing her pale lips, I promised never to leave her again.
                     There seemed to be health and strength for her in my words; for she began to
                     revive from that day, as a drooping flower is refreshed by a gentle summer
                     rain.</p>
                  <p>It was a joyful day for my little ones when, their mother came again into their
                     midst; and, as we sat down to our table together, I lifted up my voice, and
                     thanked God with a full heart, that we were once more united in harmony and
                     love.</p>
                  <p>Since that time I have sought no further for my affinity. I have harmonized
                     duty and desire, and the fruit of that union has been peace. My home is the
                     center of my joys; and my Faith, strengthened and cheered by the ministrations
                     of true love, has become not only the bond of unity to us all, but also the
                     high and holy guiding star of my heart.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                  <p>MADAM BONNIFLEUR and her daughter Violetta were in the midst of the delightful
                     garden of Mildmay Hall, gathering roses.</p>
                  <p>"Violetta," said Madam Bonnifleur, "hear what I say. Never put the least
                     confidence in a man who does not love flowers. Depend upon it, he is an
                     infidel, a barbarian, if he does not!" and in saying this she expressed her
                     whole idea of human depravity. She held up a half-blown mossrose. "Look here,"
                     she continued; "the man who would carelessly tread such a beautiful creation
                     from God under his foot is bloodthirsty and should it come in his way so to do,
                     he would as lief crush you in the dust as this flower!"</p>
                  <p>The timid and confiding girl opened wide her great blue eyes as she looked in
                     her mother's face and believed every word. She thought that men were to be
                     feared at all times; therefore she devoutly prayed that she might never meet
                     with such a one.</p>
                  <p>"Violetta, your father was one of God's own sons. His heart was full of peace
                     and good-will toward all men; and it was because he learned his lessons from
                     the book of nature, and was content with such wisdom. 'Madeline,' said he, 'we
                     are poor, blessed be God! We can not adorn our humble cottage with pictures
                     from the best artists, with marble statues or costly furniture; but God has
                     made the beautiful as free as the summer air; and no artist can out-rival his
                     perfect creations. Let us make the most, then, of what we have.' He went to
                     work with a good will, and planted vines and shrubs and flowers all about us. I
                     really believe that God aided him in his pious labors in a miraculous manner;
                     for every thing prospered to which he put his hand. The honeysuckles and
                     woodbine and roses clambered up to the very roof-tree, coming in at the
                     windows, and filling the whole house with fragrance. Oh! was it not a perfect
                     paradise? Everybody said so; even the king himself, when he rode by in his
                     chariot, and your father gathered the first and only rose from 'La belle
                     Flora,' and presented it to him with his own hands. Oh, it was a heaven upon
                     earth! There you were born; and that is the reason—blessed be God!—why you love
                     every thing that is beautiful. Your father and mother did before you; and,
                     should you ever cease to do so, you would not deserve to be called their
                     child."</p>
                  <p>Violetta began to weep, as she always did, although she had heard the same
                     story a hundred times before.</p>
                  <p>"Stop!" said Madam Bonnifleur: "you will spoil<pb n="48-49"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000025"/> your eyes, and will not be able to meet the
                     professor when he comes. Violetta, your father was too good to live, and so he
                     died. 'Madeline,' said he, with his last breath, 'plant the "La belle Flora" on
                     my grave, and in that shall my body live, and return to you again.' I did so;
                     and it has grown as no rosebush ever grew before. I believe he watches and
                     tends it himself."</p>
                  <p>She took her embroidered handkerchief from her pocket; and, after applying it
                     to her eyes several times, she went on gathering roses.</p>
                  <p>"There," said she at last, "I think we have got enough. Now, Violetta, I want
                     you to get every vase there is in the house, and carry them into the chamber
                     where the professor will sleep, and arrange these flowers as prettily as you
                     know how. I am not certain, but it would be very strange if a man who is so
                     fond of rare and beautiful things should not like flowers. And there is another
                     thing, my child, which I am very anxious to have you do. I want you to go to
                     your father's grave, and get one of the most beautiful buds from 'La belle
                     Flora.' Then, when the professor comes, and I introduce you as my daughter, I
                     want you to welcome him, and present him the bud."</p>
                  <p>Violetta dropped her scissors, and turned pale with dismay. She had seldom
                     spoken to a man, or scarce any person save her mother; and now, to think of
                     standing face to face with the awful professor, and presenting one of those
                     sacred flowers, was more than she could do.</p>
                  <p>"What is the matter, child?" said her mother. "Did not your father present a
                     rose to the king? and is it impossible for you to do such a little thing as
                     that I ask?"</p>
                  <p>Violetta said not a word. Her peace of mind was gone for the day. But she would
                     obey her mother if she died in the attempt, which she felt pretty certain would
                     be the result. She gathered up the roses, and went about her duty with a heavy
                     heart. To her, the professor, of whom she had heard much told, but had never
                     seen, seemed like a giant, or an ogre, or some such fabulous character. In her
                     mind great mental endowments were closely connected with superior physical
                     developments; and when, in comparison, she considered her own weakness, she
                     felt assured that she should be annihilated by the first glance of the
                     professor's awful eyes. Allan, the coachman, had departed some time before, to
                     bring him from the city; and Madam Bonnifleur, after she had finished her
                     preparations below, came up to see that Violetta's hair was curled, and her
                     dress arranged in a becoming manner to receive so distinguished a
                     personage.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>PROFESSOR LE BARON HARMON, the absent proprietor of Mildmay Hall, had been
                     traveling for the last five years in all the principal cities of Europe,
                     leaving his possessions to the undisputed sway of the widow, Madam Bonnifleur,
                     who had been recommended to him as a most capable and trustworthy woman.
                     Holding, as he<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6310-00000026"/> did, a high position in
                     society, wedded to science, and adapting himself easily to the manners and
                     habits of all people, he possessed the most favorable opportunities for
                     acquiring knowledge. Though he was a philosopher, and a hard student, yet he
                     was a finished gentleman. He waltzed with the ladies at Paris, chatted French,
                     Italian, or German, as it suited his convenience, was passionately fond of
                     music; and wherever a "prima donna" made her appearance, he was sure to be
                     among the first to hear her. The atmosphere of old universities and public
                     libraries, of lecture-rooms, and private studios of grave German professors,
                     seemed to be his native element; and yet he sailed on the Adriatic by
                     moonlight, spent whole days among the paintings and sculpture in the halls of
                     art at Paris, Florence, Dresden, and other places, and everywhere carried a
                     quick eye and an open heart for all that was beautiful. Now he was about to
                     return to his patrimonial estate, with an immense amount of information, a
                     large collection of Grecian marbles and remnants of antiquity, quite a library
                     which he had collected in his travels, and many beautiful pictures and statues.
                     Madam Bonnifleur had been duly notified of his arrival in the city, and he was
                     expected at the Hall about sunset.</p>
                  <p>Had the king and all his court expressed their intention of making her a visit,
                     she could not have made greater preparations. She had seen the professor but a
                     few times before his departure; and as she was greatly impressed with the idea
                     of his superiority, she now proceeded accordingly. Every room was thrown open
                     and dusted; rugs were turned right-side up; pictures unveiled; coverings
                     removed from sofas, chairs, and tables; and every scrap of brass or silver or
                     any other metal about the furniture, was polished to the highest degree of
                     brilliancy. The great vase in the parlor was crowned with a mountain of roses,
                     and numerous smaller vases were filled with beautiful buds and blossoms,
                     loading the air with their fragrance, and giving the whole room the appearance
                     of a floral exhibition. Madam Bonnifleur was arrayed in her best brocade silk
                     and blonde-lace-cap, which was ornamented with elegant bows of white crape,
                     intermingled with moss-rose buds, made by the best artists of Paris. All these
                     important arrangements occupied so much time, that it was quite late before she
                     could turn her attention to violetta; and then, considering the amount of
                     crimping and curling to be done, she felt that the girl's indifference was
                     really provoking. At length, however, the work was completed to her mother's
                     satisfaction; and, in her airy robes of pure white muslin, with her golden
                     curls floating about her sweet face and fair round shoulders, she did indeed
                     look very beautiful. Madam Bonnifleur saw this plainly; and with all a mother's
                     pride, she followed her where ever she went, cautioning her continually, least
                     some unlucky shake of the head, or a sport or wrinkle, should spoil the whole
                     effect.</p>
                  <p>In a small silver vase, upon the parlor table, was the exquisite blossom from
                     "La belle Flora," intended for the professor; and, as soon as the sound of the
                     carriage was heard coming up the avenue. Madam Bonnifleur called out—</p>
                  <p>"Quick, Violetta! take the bud, and stand in the hall there, just inside the
                     door!" And in one moment<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6310-00000027"/> there stood
                     Violetta, looking very pale, and exceedingly frightened.</p>
                  <p>The professor made his appearance, and shook hands very cordially with Madam
                     Bonnifleur. He was all smiles, bows, and compliments, which were unaffected,
                     and came as naturally to him as the air he breathed. Delighted beyond measure,
                     she returned his salutation with great warmth, and turned to present Violetta
                     to him; but she was gone. No sooner was the coach-door opened than she had
                     fled, like a frightened bird, up the stairs, not stopping till she was sure she
                     was beyond observation, when she knelt, with a throbbing heart, and looked down
                     through the balustrade. She observed the courteous manner of the professor as
                     he addressed her mother; she heard his cheerful and pleasant voice, and saw
                     that he was not so very large, after all; neither did he wear spectacles or a
                     wig. This was very consoling; but when she observed her mother's troubled look
                     as she missed her, her heart failed her entirely, and she began to weep, as she
                     always did when any thing troubled her. Fearing lest she should be discovered,
                     she descended by another staircase to the garden; and concealing herself in a
                     bower of roses, she sat and cried to her heart's content.</p>
                  <p>Much to Madam Bonnifleur's disappointment, the professor seemed to take very
                     little notice of the arrangements which had cost her so much time and trouble.
                     He walked over the rich carpet as carelessly as if it had been canvas; glanced
                     around with a smiling countenance; declared himself very happy to be at home
                     again; inquired how her health had been during his absence; expressed great
                     satisfaction at the favorable ble accounts he had received of her management;
                     and ended with many thanks and compliments to her capability and faithfulness.
                     All this was so very agreeable that she could easily forgive him for
                     overlooking minor points; and, for the time, she suffered her roses to go
                     unnoticed. The professor soon retired to his library; and, after continuing
                     there a short time, he went out to look around the garden and grounds.</p>
                  <p>The last rays of the setting sun were shining upon the groves of Mildmay Hall.
                     The cool evening breeze after the sultry day, the singing of the birds as they
                     came home to their nests, and the hum of the weary insects, were all very
                     pleasing to one who was ever awake to beauty and harmony; and as he wandered
                     slowly down the green avenues, and through the winding pathways, with his hat
                     in his hand, his face expressed all the quiet happiness he felt within.</p>
                  <p>At length he came to the bower of roses, so enchantingly beautiful; and there
                     in the midst, with her head reclined upon her arm, sat Violetta, fast asleep.
                     As the evening winds played with her floating curls and light drapery, she
                     seemed so unreal and spirit-like that he could hardly believe her to be a
                     mortal; and, at the first sight, he uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>
                  <p>Startled by the sound, she sprang to her feet and stood before him tip-toe with
                     astonishment. Her lips were half apart, her great blue eyes fixed upon him, and
                     her hair seemed to be rising up like golden rays about her head. So surprised
                     and alarmed did she seem, that he could not refrain from smiling.</p>
                  <p>"Why, my dear child!" said he in a very pleasant tone, "I did not intend to
                     frighten you; for I really<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6310-00000028"/> did not
                     expect to find any one here; but since I have met you thus, shall I do wrong to
                     ask your name?"</p>
                  <p>Perhaps no stranger but the amiable professor could have asked this question
                     and received a reply. But there was always something in his tone and manner, in
                     his happiest moods, which seemed to inspire confidence; and now, as the
                     frightened girl looked earnestly in his face, she began to settle down more
                     quietly upon the earth, answering, in a very low, musical voice,
                     "Violetta."</p>
                  <p>"Well, Violetta," said the professor, "I never saw you before. Do you have a
                     home like other people? or do you always live here among the roses?"</p>
                  <p>There was a faint smile playing upon her lips, as she shook her head gently,
                     and answered,—</p>
                  <p>"No, sir: I live at the Hall."</p>
                  <p>"At the Hall? What, with Madam Bonnifleur?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir. She is my mother."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! yes,—yes," said the professor thoughtfully; "I recollect, she said she had
                     a daughter. Well, Violetta, I am very glad to find you here; and I hope, since
                     we are to be companions, that we shall also be very good friends. Come and sit
                     down beside me; for I would like to talk with you a while, and get a little
                     better acquainted."</p>
                  <p>The girl's blue eyes grew a great deal larger, and she shrank behind a rosebush
                     till he could see nothing of her save her face peeping through the green
                     foliage.</p>
                  <p>"Do you like flowers?" he asked, in order to keep up the conversation.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes!" she answered readily. "I like them better than any thing else in the
                     world: don't you?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, I like them pretty well," said the professor, "but not so much as that.
                     You know there are a great many things in the world far more beautiful than
                     flowers."</p>
                  <p>"I never saw any thing that was," said Violetta.</p>
                  <p>"Then you will have an opportunity to-morrow, when my pictures and statues
                     come. Were you never away from home?"</p>
                  <p>"No, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Not even at school?"</p>
                  <p>"No, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Then how have you ever learned any thing?"</p>
                  <p>"My mother has taught me. She says she knows all that <emph>any</emph> woman
                     need know."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed! Your mother is a wonderful woman, and I think she has a wonderful
                     daughter. How old are you, Violetta?"</p>
                  <p>"Sixteen, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Sixteen!" exclaimed the astonished professor. "Excuse me: I took you for a
                     mere child."</p>
                  <p>"So I am," she said quietly; "and I think I always shall be."</p>
                  <p>"Why so, my dear girl?"</p>
                  <p>"Because mother says that people get strange notions into their heads, and are
                     not so good when they grow older. I have never seen a great many people; but I
                     know it is true." She looked so demure, and spoke with such unaffected
                     simplicity, that the professor laughed outright.</p>
                  <p>"Alas!" he said, as he shook his head doubtingly, "you are indeed an innocent
                     maiden, and have seen but little of the world. You will find, however, that<pb
                        n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6310-00000029"/> growing old is a necessity of our
                     nature; and before three years are at an end, I doubt not you will have many
                     strange notions in your head and heart also. You will not be worth much, if you
                     are not capable of it. They who would become all that God intended must submit
                     quietly to his purposes, and experience every emotion of joy and sorrow, of
                     love, of hope, and fear and desolation, and all the hard but salutary
                     discipline of life. They who shrink back from this may walk with garments
                     unsoiled, but they always remain in a state of infant weakness."</p>
                  <p>As he spoke, she had stepped slowly from behind the bush, and stood gazing at
                     him very earnestly.</p>
                  <p>"I don't believe it," said she, as he ended.</p>
                  <p>"Why not?"</p>
                  <p>"Because, if I choose, I can live as good and true a life in an acorn-cup as if
                     I traveled the world over. Please, sir, may I go now?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said the professor, who was very much confused and puzzled at her
                     manner. He was really in doubt whether it was himself who knew the best about
                     such matters, or Violetta. He could philosophize; but it was very apparent,
                     with all her simplicity, that she had thought; and the education which nature
                     had given her had left her eyes unclouded to beauties which were not revealed
                     to him.</p>
                  <p>As she passed him, she bowed as gracefully as any lady from Paris; and then,
                     quickening her step, she flew down the green and winding pathway as lightly as
                     a fairy.</p>
                  <p>"Well," said the professor, as he looked after her with wondering eyes, "I can
                     truly say that I have seen something perfectly original. Here is a mind, as one
                     might say, in a state of nature. Its faculties have never been developed by the
                     common modes of education; but yet the outward manifestations show a depth of
                     inward beauty well worth one's time to seek and understand. I have really
                     dreaded the loneliness and seclusion of this place; but already here is one
                     object of interest. Violetta shall become my pupil, and I will analyze her mind
                     until I come at the very mainspring of its action."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <p>So vexed was Madam Bonnifleur at the sudden disappearance of Violetta, that she
                     took no pains to look after her, but went about her household duties as usual.
                     After the professor had retired for the night, she walked out upon the front
                     portico; and as she stood contemplating the quiet moonlight scene, Violetta
                     stole softly up to her, and laid her head upon her arm.</p>
                  <p>"Violetta," said Madam Bonnifleur, "I am very much offended with you for
                     leaving me as you did. You may go to your room: I do not want to talk to you
                     to-night."</p>
                  <p>"O mother!" said Violetta, as she clung closely to her, "pray don't speak so. I
                     couldn't help it; indeed, I could not, for I didn't know what I was doing! I
                     left the 'La belle Flora' in his room, and it will be just as well for him to
                     have it there."</p>
                  <p>"Fie, child! I wanted you to give it to him yourself: I wanted him to see
                     you."</p>
                  <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6310-00000030"/>
                  <p>"But he <emph>has</emph> seen me, mother."</p>
                  <p>"Where?"</p>
                  <p>"He found me among the roses, fast asleep; and I could not get away."</p>
                  <p>"Very good: I am glad of it. Well, what did he say?"</p>
                  <p>"He asked me if I liked flowers."</p>
                  <p>"Was that all?"</p>
                  <p>"No. I told him I did, and asked him if <emph>he</emph> liked them. He said,
                     'Yes, a little; but there were other things in the world a great deal more
                     beautiful.'"</p>
                  <p>"I understand what he meant by that,"said Madam Bonnifleur, looking very much
                     gratified. "Violetta, the professor is an excellent man: he reminds me more and
                     more of Eugene, your father. He has all his pleasant ways and manners, his
                     smile and the very sound of his voice are like him. You can not think how
                     attentively he listens to me, and is interested in all I say. I am certain that
                     he is extravagantly fond of flowers; but, as he says, there are some things in
                     the world far more beautiful. Could you see with his eyes, you would find it
                     so. Had you given him the 'La belle Flora,' as I intended you should, he would
                     have placed it in his bosom; and he would never have taken it thence, till it
                     dropped away, leaf by leaf."</p>
                  <p>Just then the window was opened above, and, one after another, the beautiful
                     bouquets which Violetta had so carefully arranged were tossed out upon the
                     grass. Both stood silent with astonishment for a moment; and then Madam
                     Bonnifleur, elevating her hands and eyes, exclaimed,—</p>
                  <p>"Violetta, that man is an infidel, a barbarian! Who could have thought it was
                     in him to do such a thing? Now I shall believe him capable of any thing. Had
                     these roses been so many infant children, it would have been just the same. He
                     is a dangerous and deceitful person, Violetta, and I warn you to avoid
                     him!"</p>
                  <p>Violetta wept; not so much at the depravity of the professor, however, as at
                     the abuse of the flowers. They had been her pets and playthings from her
                     childhood,—the only companions she ever had; and now, as she turned away to go
                     to her little chamber, they seemed to be calling after her most piteously to
                     come and care for them.</p>
                  <p>"They may as well lie in the grass to-night," said Madam Bonnifleur: "the dew
                     will keep them fresh, and you can gather them up in the morning; but this is
                     the last chance he shall ever have to do such a thing!"</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                  <p>No sooner had the sun risen, and the early birds begun to sing, than Violetta
                     started out, with her basket upon her arm, to gather up and comfort her
                     suffering flowers. As she was wholly absorbed in her employment, and placed
                     each one carefully in the basket, she heard a footstep; and, looking up,
                     greatly to her discomposure, she saw the professor standing close beside
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"Good-morning, Violetta," said he, with the same pleasant smile he wore the day
                     preceding. She was so startled, and trembled so, she could not answer.</p>
                  <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6310-00000031"/>
                  <p>"You see," he continued, "how very rudely I have treated your little favorites;
                     but, under the circumstances, it was the best thing I could do. Do you not know
                     that it is really injurious to sleep with flowers in the room?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, no!" said Violetta, looking up very much surprised. "I always have
                     flowers in my room."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, let me advise you not to do so again. A few, perhaps, will do no
                     harm; but you were so very generous in your decoration of my apartment, that
                     the air was really oppressive. In some cases, this cause has been known to
                     produce death. An old German physician related to me an instance of this kind
                     not long ago."</p>
                  <p>How suddenly the weight of guilt had changed! The professor was innocent of any
                     evil: but Violetta felt in a moment, that, had it not been for his wisdom, she
                     might have been the cause of his death; and, as the appalling thought came over
                     her, she actually turned pale.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, dear!" she exclaimed, as she looked up with tearful eyes to his face, "I
                     didn't mean to! I never knew any better!"</p>
                  <p>The professor smiled; and, as he laid his hand upon her head, he said
                     kindly,—</p>
                  <p>"Why, there is no harm done, my dear girl! We must all live and learn."</p>
                  <p>He helped her gather up the flowers very carefully; and then, taking the basket
                     on one arm, with the other he assisted her to spring over the high, wet grass.
                     All the unkind feelings, and most of the fear she had felt for him, vanished
                     before his kindness: she hopped through the grass as lightly as a bird, and
                     laughed when he called her "little feather-foot."</p>
                  <p>Madam Bonnifleur stood just behind the shrubbery in the portico, and saw this,
                     but did not know the reason.</p>
                  <p>"Alas!" she exclaimed: "that vile deceiver means to win my little rosebud, and
                     crush her as carelessly as he would a withered flower. Good Lord deliver
                     her!"</p>
                  <p>"Good-morning, madam," said the professor, in his usual courteous manner and
                     cheerful tone.</p>
                  <p>She only answered by a stiff bow; and, with a very expressive glance at
                     Violetta, she bade her go and look to some of the household affairs.</p>
                  <p>After breakfast, the professor mounted his horse and took his way toward the
                     city, in hopes to meet the goods which he had expected the night before.
                     Violetta went into the garden to attend to the roses; and Madam Bonnifleur
                     commenced her daily "clearing-up," which consisted in going into every room in
                     the house, sweeping and dusting, and putting every thing right which in her
                     judgment was wrong.</p>
                  <p>Violetta was very busily engaged, when she was surprised by hearing her mother
                     call out, in a hurried tone, from the professor's chamber-window,—</p>
                  <p>"O Violetta! come here, quick!"</p>
                  <p>Violetta ran as fast as possible up the stairs into the room. There stood her
                     mother, looking the very picture of distress: while upon a sheet of white paper
                     which lay upon the table was the sacred bud of "La belle Flora,"
                        <emph>murdered,</emph> separated, dissected, and divided in every part:
                     petals, calyx, stamens, pistil,<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6310-00000032"/>
                     pericarp, and even the woody stem, laid open from top to bottom.</p>
                  <p>"Violetta," said she, "did you ever see the like of that? Here is the beautiful
                     bud taken from the bush upon my dear husband's grave, which he has watched over
                     and tended himself, torn in pieces and mutilated, as though God had never
                     intended it for any thing better! If learning has such an effect upon a
                     person's morals, may you be free from it, Violetta, as long as you live! I have
                     heard of such men, who stick pins through beetles, choke humming-birds, drown
                     lizards in alcohol, and smoke butterflies, bugs, and spiders to death with
                     brimstone, all for the sake of science, as they call it; but, in my mind, it is
                     only a miserable excuse for gratifying their own evil natures, and destroying
                     every thing that is good and beautiful in God's creation. Yes, Violetta, such a
                     man, did human laws allow it, would just as readily cut off your right hand to
                     see how it was fashioned, or pluck out your eyes to find the secret of their
                     coloring. Be careful, my child; for this man will win your heart, if he can,
                     and treat it just the same as he has this flower."</p>
                  <p>She spoke figuratively; but Violetta, with the dissected flower before her
                     eyes, could only comprehend it in a literal sense. She laid her hands, with a
                     sense of pain, upon her heart; and wondered how there came to be such people in
                     the world, who could carry so fair an outside, while within was such cruelty
                     and deceit. She gathered up the fragments of the mutilated bud as a memorial;
                     and, inwardly resolving to shut her eyes and ears against his pleasant smiles
                     and words, she went back to her roses, despairing of humanity in general, and
                     the professor in particular.</p>
                  <p>It was not long before the expected goods arrived. Then commenced a great
                     hammering and opening of boxes, taking down old pictures and hanging up new
                     ones, displacing and replacing, till Madam Bonnifleur's patience was quite
                     exhausted, and she was disposed to be very unpropitious. She left the professor
                     to his own ways, and would not volunteer the least advice or assistance.</p>
                  <p>"Madam Bonnifleur," he said at last, "please come here one moment, and tell me
                     how you like my statues."</p>
                  <p>Thus called upon, she could not avoid stepping into the room. There stood a
                     most exquisite Venus de Medicis, and opposite to her an Apollo Belvidere. Madam
                     Bonnifleur had never seen such specimens of art before, and did not know how to
                     understand them. She was shocked beyond measure at the professor's taste, and
                     could not in conscience say a word in their praise.</p>
                  <p>"Are they not beautiful?" he asked, as he looked upon the fair and symmetrical
                     proportions with admiring eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Beautiful!" she replied, with an expression of the greatest contempt: "they
                     are the most heathenish-looking things I ever saw. I should just as lief have
                     an Indian idol, or the calf the children of Israel worshiped, set up here, as
                     these!"</p>
                  <p>"Why, my dear madam!" exclaimed the professor, "they were executed by one of
                     the best artists."</p>
                  <p>"He ought to have been executed himself," she replied quickly. "For my part, I
                     have no taste for such indecent things. There are some people who<pb n="64-65"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000033"/> only reckon beauty by expense, and fall into
                     raptures about any thing a man has made, when the smallest flower in God's
                     kingdom is ten times more wonderful."</p>
                  <p>The professor did not appear to be disturbed in the least by her speech or
                     manner. He bowed and smiled just the same as ever, and remarked in a very
                     affable way, "Your taste does not agree with mine, madam." She stopped a moment
                     longer; and, finding that he was not disposed to say any thing further, she
                     left the room.</p>
                  <p>It was not many moments before Violetta went tripping past the door, with a
                     little basket of roses on her arm. "Violetta," said he, "come here and tell me
                     what <emph>you</emph> think of my statues."</p>
                  <p>Her horror of the professor was still fresh in her mind; but when she turned,
                     and saw those wonderful creations of art, all else was forgotten, and she
                     stepped forward with unaffected admiration.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, how beautiful!" exclaimed the pure-hearted girl. She looked at the
                     exquisite foot of the Venus, the beautiful hand, the swelling bust, the
                     faultless curve of the neck and shoulders, and the delicately chiseled
                     features. Her quick eye detected every trace of beauty at one glance; and her
                     face spoke all, though her tongue was silent.</p>
                  <p>The professor watched her closely. He was more pleased than if she had spoken
                     in many words; and, smiling with much satisfaction, he pointed to the
                     Apollo.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, how great, how grand, and strong he looks!" she said, as she gazed up at
                     the noble figure, with its correct, manly proportions; and she seemed to shrink
                     back and grow smaller in herself, as though the majesty of genius was too
                     powerful for her.</p>
                  <p>"She has the true appreciation of the beautiful," thought the professor, with
                     great pleasure. "Violetta," said he, "can you tell me why it is you like my
                     statues?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! it is because they are so much like life; and it is wonderful they could
                     be made so!"</p>
                  <p>"But which do you think are the most beautiful, my statues or your
                     flowers?"</p>
                  <p>"My flowers," she replied, without the least hesitation; and, as she glanced
                     down at the roses, she raised the basket and kissed them. Had any one else done
                     this, he would have called it affectation and sentimentality; but he knew the
                     girl's simple heart, and would not misjudge her.</p>
                  <p>"But, Violetta," said he, "these beautiful and perfect forms were created by
                     the hand of a poor mortal man, out of great rough blocks of marble."</p>
                  <p>"And my roses," said the girl triumphantly, as she raised her basket, "were
                     made by the hand of God himself, out of nothing and less than nothing!" With
                     another kiss she placed them upon her head, and tripped out of the room.</p>
                  <p>"Puzzled again!" said the professor, as he looked after her with a perplexed
                     look. "So, then, the most beautiful works of art in the whole universe are only
                     a passing wonder to this girl; while her roses not only claim her love, her
                     admiration, and her care, but prevent her feeling the inspiration which the
                     works of genius impart. However, it is all in education: her taste only needs
                     to be cultivated."</p>
                  <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6310-00000034"/>
                  <p>"Well, I suppose it <emph>is</emph> in education," said Madam Bonnifleur, who
                     had stepped in unobserved, to have an eye on Violetta; "and if education so
                     blinds people that they must daub over miles of canvas, and hew out great idols
                     of wood and iron and stone, before they can see what is beautiful, I desire my
                     daughter should remain as she is. 'God made man upright, but he has sought out
                     many inventions;' and, while he worships images of paint and plaster, he will
                     think it mere child's play to cut up and destroy the most exquisite specimens
                     of God's handiwork,—as you did last night, sir, with that precious bud from 'La
                     belle Flora.'"</p>
                  <p>"Madam," said the professor, with the utmost suavity, "I perceive that I have
                     given offense, but I shall offer no apology. The bud of which you speak was so
                     rare and beautiful a specimen of its kind, that I could not resist the
                     temptation to analyze it, and examine it in its several parts. Two whole hours
                     did I spend over it, and felt well satisfied in so doing; otherwise I should
                     have given it a careless glance, passing it by as a beautiful thing, and
                     nothing more. Let me assure you, madam, that an inward as well as an outward
                     beauty exists in all such things. One is apparent to all: the child sees, it as
                     well as the philosopher. But the eye of the intellect looks deeper than the
                     mere externals; and the finger of science unfolds leaf and bud, until it seeks
                     out the very soul of the beautiful. The child admires, but the philosopher
                     wonders and adores."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed!" said Madam Bonnifleur, and that was all she còuld say. She was really
                     outdone; and began to feel, that, after all, she did not know
                        <emph>quite</emph> as much as any woman need to.</p>
                  <p>"Violetta," he continued, "loves her roses. I do not question her sincerity in
                     the least; but how much dearer would they be to her, could she clearly
                     comprehend the wondrous beauty, the world of wisdom, that is folded in their
                     little leaves! She herself is a sweet flower; and though her simple innocence
                     and beauty may win admiration, which in itself is but a subtle poison, yet she
                     needs cultivation, strengthening, education. Add to her natural charms the
                     beauty of the intellect, and she would be a perfect 'La belle Flora' in
                     herself. Now she is a pretty pet, a plaything for an idle hour; but is she thus
                     a fit companion for the wise and great?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no!" said Madam Bonnifleur, with a most disconsolate look. "I really wish
                     she did know more; but then I don't see how it can be done."</p>
                  <p>"There is nothing easier," said the professor. "It would give me the greatest
                     pleasure to receive Violetta as a pupil. Her quick appreciation of the
                     beautiful, her evident ability to reason, and her child-like confidence, all
                     afford abundant reasons for success. Would you but grant me the liberty, madam,
                     you should see how faithfully the work would be performed."</p>
                  <p>"Professor Harmon," said Madam Bonnifleur, "you are too good!" She grasped his
                     hand warmly; and, because her heart was so full that she did not know what to
                     say next, she left the room, and went directly to the garden to cut some
                     asparagus for the professor's dinner.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                  <p>AFTER this, Violetta's education was the chief thought in the professor's mind.
                     He understood human nature too well to undertake to call her directly from her
                     roses; but he artfully contrived, by taking advantage of her love of the
                     beautiful, to win her mind to his purposes. As she stole now and then into the
                     parlor, to look up with admiring eyes to the beautiful statues and paintings,
                     he would draw her into conversation, by asking her to point out their various
                     merits, and then criticise her taste. He discoursed, too, so very eloquently
                     upon the eminent painters and sculptors of all times,—Michael Angelo, Raphael,
                     Guido, Rubens, Phidias, Canova, Thorwaldsen, and others,—that he was really
                     surprised at himself; and she stood looking him earnestly in the face, drinking
                     in every word with the deepest interest. He spoke of their early struggles,
                     their patient perseverance, and then of the fruits of their wonderful genius,
                     and their undying fame. It was very evident, that, for the time, he held her
                     mind as by a magic spell; but, as soon as he was done, she vanished: and, when
                     he sought her, he found her sitting in the bower of roses, with her embroidery,
                     keeping time with her busy fingers to the sweet songs she sang. She looked so
                     serene and happy, it seemed almost a sin to call her away; but he felt that the
                     cultivation and improvement of her taste were of too much importance to be
                     neglected. He talked to her very seriously at last; and then she came and sat
                     by him several hours each day, reading, listening to his instructions, or
                     reciting the lessons she had learned. She made astonishing progress; and
                     sometimes, when she forgot her restraint, she would burst forth into such a
                     free and beautiful utterance of her thoughts on any subject in which she was
                     interested, that the professor thought it would be really worth his while to
                     throw down his philosophy, and take lessons of her in natural inspiration.
                     "Certainly," thought he, "she is a very interesting pupil;" and he could not
                     bear she should leave him one moment. In spite of the professor's eloquence,
                     however, and his winning smiles, no sooner had the hours allotted to his
                     instructions expired, than up sprang Violetta, and darted away to the bower of
                     roses.</p>
                  <p>"Violetta," said the professor one day, as he came with a large book of poetry
                     under his arm, to the green knoll where she was sitting, "why do you never take
                     your work and sit with me? I would read to you, and I think it would be very
                     pleasant to both of us."</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" said she, "it is because I love so much to hear the humming-birds and
                     bees among the roses, and the singing of the wind in the trees."</p>
                  <p>"Fie!" said the professor, a little impatiently: "such talk is all moonshine,
                     Violetta. Are you made any wiser or better by it?"</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps no wiser, but a great deal better. The books tire me; but this gives
                     me a warm, fresh feeling in my heart, which does not go away. And then I think
                     that it is very foolish for us to study so hard to get wisdom out of books, and
                     to see beauty in the<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6310-00000036"/> works of art,
                     when the little simple things which God has given to the poorest of his
                     children can make us so much happier and better."</p>
                  <p>He had never seen her look so calm and beautiful before, as she did when she
                     said this. A sweet smile played upon her lips, and the clear depths of her
                     large blue eyes revealed the gentle and loving spirit within. Her peaceful,
                     unambitious spirit was a complete mystery to the wise man, and he really envied
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"Violetta," said he very seriously, "why is it I do not feel these same
                     influences of which you speak?"</p>
                  <p>"I will tell you," she replied; and she laid down her work, and looked at him
                     very earnestly for a moment. "It is because you and I are so different."</p>
                  <p>The professor did not speak another word. He bit his lips very hard, put his
                     great book under his arm again, and walked off down the path, wondering if the
                     difference between their minds could ever be reconciled.</p>
                  <p>"Violetta," said Madam Bonnifleur, "you must not go to the bower of roses so
                     much. The professor is very kind to you, and does all he can for your
                     improvement. It is very evident that it really vexes him to have you appear so
                     indifferent, and slip away from him at every opportunity."</p>
                  <p>"Mother," said Violetta, "did you not tell me, that, if I lost my love for the
                     beautiful, I should be unworthy to be called the daughter of the good father
                     who sleeps under the 'La belle Flora'? And shall I not forget, if I do not go
                     often among the roses he loved so well?"</p>
                  <p>"No, child!" said Madam Bonnifleur hastily: "there are more beautiful things in
                     this world than roses. Just look at the professor's pictures and statues!"</p>
                  <p>"But my good father, you said, learned his lessons from the book of Nature; he
                     had no pictures and statues, but he loved every thing that and was beautiful,
                     and was one of God's own children. That's just what I want to be, mother, and
                     nothing more."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, dear!" sighed Madam Bonnifleur, quite disconcerted by this repetition of
                     her own words: "I almost wish, sometimes, there were no such things as roses.
                     The professor knows a great deal more than your father did, and you had best
                     try to be like him."</p>
                  <p>She shuddered, however, when she said it. For several successive nights the
                     placid countenance of her departed husband had appeared to her in her dreams;
                     and, as it faded slowly away in the silvery mist about him, he would say, "Come
                     with me, Madeline: "the roses will take care of Violetta." It made her feel
                     sick and nervous; and she longed to feel assured that Violetta would have a
                     friend and protector who would not fail her should she be taken away.</p>
                  <p>It was not long before Violetta perceived her mother's uneasiness; and she
                     followed her like a shadow, watching her countenance with the greatest anxiety,
                     anticipating her wishes, and doing all in her power to relieve her mind of its
                     secret trouble. Her studies and her roses were forsaken; and as she tripped
                     lightly about, looking to the duties of the household with womanly dignity, but
                     with the same untroubled sweetness, the professor felt that he was
                     "entertaining an angel," not "unawares," but one who was commissioned to teach
                     him the beauty of a perfect and simple life.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                  <p>ONE evening, when the professor had just returned from the city, he placed an
                     elegant and curiously-wrought box in the hand of Violetta. She opened it, and
                     found it contained a magnificent pair of ear-rings, and a diamond necklace.
                     "Will you wear them for the giver's sake?" said the professor.</p>
                  <p>"Certainly she will!" exclaimed Madam Bonnifleur, in the greatest delight. "Oh,
                     I never saw any thing so rich and splendid in all my life! Why, Violetta! you
                     will never be able to thank the professor enough for such a costly
                     present!"</p>
                  <p>Violetta looked at the jewels in the greatest dismay. She did not smile, but
                     looked up with a bewildered gaze, first at her mother, and then at the
                     professor.</p>
                  <p>"Why, what is the matter with you, child?" said Madam Bonnifleur. "You look as
                     though you were stupefied. Why don't you speak, and say something?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, dear!" said Violetta, bursting into tears: "I know you will call me wicked
                     and ungrateful, but indeed I do not want them!"</p>
                  <p>"Why not?" said the professor, in a very solemn tone.</p>
                  <p>"Because I am a poor, simple-hearted girl, and was never made to wear such
                     splendid jewels. Take them and give them to the Lady Arabella Huntley, who rode
                     down from the city with you the other day. She is so charming, oh, so
                     beautiful! that such things seem made expressly for her. I have lived among the
                     roses so long, that I must be like them, and wear no ornaments save those that
                     Nature gives me."</p>
                  <p>"Roses!" exclaimed Madam Bonnifleur. "I will have every one in the garden
                     rooted up and burned, if you say any thing more about them!"</p>
                  <p>"But you will not root up the 'La belle Flora,' will you, mother? The dust that
                     clings about that, and nourishes it, is too sacred."</p>
                  <p>Madam Bonnifleur turned very pale, and said no more. Violetta allowed the
                     professor to clasp the diamonds about her neck; but at the same time she looked
                     up in his face with such a pleading gaze, that he put the ear-rings aside, and
                     asked her to go up on the hill with him to see the sun set.</p>
                  <p>Violetta hesitated. "How do you feel to-night, mother?" she asked tenderly, and
                     kissed her pale cheek.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, nicely!" said Madam Bonnifleur: "you need fear nothing for me;" but, as
                     soon as they were gone, she laid back her head with a faint moan, and called in
                     the servant-girl to sit with her. The spirit of her departed husband seemed to
                     stand very near her that night, and she feared that she had not spoken just as
                     she should to Violetta.</p>
                  <p>Feeling very much relieved at this favorable conclusion of her trial, Violetta
                     stepped lightly down the avenue, talking in a very cheerful tone to the
                     professor; and, when they came to the steep till which they were to ascend, she
                     went scampering up as swiftly as a gazelle.</p>
                  <p>"Let me help you, Violetta," said the professor; but,<pb n="74-75"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000038"/> with a merry laugh, she waved back his hand, and
                     sprang over the broken rocks in the rude pathway, challenging him to reach the
                     summit before her. He followed her as closely as possible; but when he came out
                     from the thick grove of cedars which shaded the pathway, he saw her standing on
                     the great stone which crowned the hilltop. He was struck with astonishment at
                     her singular appearance, and stopped to gaze at her.</p>
                  <p>As she stood upon the rock, her feet scarce seemed to touch the surface; her
                     thin, white garments floated about her like an airy cloud; her mantle, light as
                     a gossamer, was streaming on the wind, and the golden rays of the sunset shed a
                     halo of brightness all about her. She seemed to be transfigured before him;
                     and, when he saw her face glowing with such celestial beauty, he would not have
                     wondered had she ascended at that moment, and vanished from his sight. There
                     was only one thing which marred the perfection of her spiritual beauty, and
                     that was the necklace of diamonds blazing like a cincture of light about her
                     neck. He saw, and in his heart he acknowledged it.</p>
                  <p>"Violetta," said he, as he stood beside her, "what has come over you? I never
                     saw you look so strangely!" But she did not seem to observe him. She spread out
                     her hands with an impassioned gesture toward the heavens, where the radiant
                     sunlight was blending with the crimson and purple glories of the evening.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, in a clear voice which was almost startling in its
                     intonation, "it is the Beautiful, the Altogether Lovely!"</p>
                  <p>So singular was the expression of her countenance, that he believed she had
                     lost her reason. He put his arms closely about her, and turned her face toward
                     him; but her look was peaceful and calm: only a mysterious light, a seraphic
                     joy was there, which he could not understand.</p>
                  <p>"What do you mean, Violetta?" he asked.</p>
                  <p>"I mean," she said, "that above, and around, and in myself, I feel the moving
                     Spirit of God. Don't you?"</p>
                  <p>"No," he said slowly. He had always reasoned by scientific rules,—had drawn
                     correct inferences from known facts, and founded his belief upon principles
                     which, to him, were perfectly clear and familiar, therefore he could not
                     understand her; but, whatever it might be, it was a mysterious cause which
                     produced such an effect.</p>
                  <p>"Violetta," he said, "you are too transcendental. All this is excitement of the
                     imagination, undisciplined by correct mental cultivation. It will all vanish
                     away in the midst of the stern realities of life, to which you will yet be
                     called, and leave you helpless and unprotected."</p>
                  <p>"I should die without it!" she said earnestly. "Were it not for this warmth,
                     this kindling glow in my heart, I should wither at the first touch of sorrow,
                     like flowers before the frost."</p>
                  <p>"But, Violetta, it is childish! It is time that you put on all the
                     thoughtfulness and dignity of a woman."</p>
                  <p>"The Lady Arabella is a woman," said Violetta, "but I never shall be. I shall
                     always be a child of God, nothing more."</p>
                  <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6310-00000039"/>
                  <p>"No," he replied: "your whole nature will change when you have once learned to
                     love."</p>
                  <p>"Love!" exclaimed Violetta, in perfect astonishment: "don't I love my mother
                     now, with all my heart, and you too?"</p>
                  <p>"Me!" said the professor.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," she replied, with the utmost composure. "I love you more than I can
                     tell."</p>
                  <p>As she stood upon the rock, her hand rested lightly on his shoulder, and the
                     golden ringlets of her wavy hair were blown against his cheek. He looked into
                     her face; but there came no deeper crimson to the soft, tinted cheek, and there
                     was the same untroubled clearness in her mild blue eyes. At that moment, with
                     the quickness of thought, he sought through the whole range of his science and
                     philosophy, to find the key which should unlock to him the mysteries of her
                     soul; but in vain.</p>
                  <p>"Violetta," said he, "do you love me well enough to become one with me in
                     life,—to share my joys and sorrows, my hopes and fears, my interests and
                     pursuits?"</p>
                  <p>"No," she replied, without hesitation; "that is impossible."</p>
                  <p>"Why so?"</p>
                  <p>"Because you and I are so different."</p>
                  <p>There was that same simple and decisive answer again; but this time it came to
                     him with power. He had asked the question with philosophical coolness, but he
                     cared more for the answer than he had supposed. His feelings were greatly
                     disturbed; but there she stood, as calm and serene as ever. He felt that there
                     was, indeed, a mighty difference between them; and a great gulf, which neither
                     love, nor hope, nor wisdom could overleap. A feeling of weariness came over
                     him, as he remembered the long years he had spend in study and toil, his deep
                     researches, his midnight vigils, and his aching brain. He had climbed up the
                     hill of science, and sat down in the golden porch of its temple; but she had
                     walked in lowly and simple ways, and won a warmth and inspiration which he
                     could not understand. Nowhere, in the wide range of human philosophy could the
                     explanation be found; for these spiritual things could only be spiritually
                     discerned.</p>
                  <p>As he glanced up to her face again, he saw her leaning forward, with lips half
                     apart, looking earnestly toward the Hall, which could be seen plainly from the
                     spot where they stood. Then she sprang from the rock, and darted down the
                     pathway. He looked, and saw a servant standing on the piazza, beckoning to
                     them. As fast as possible he followed in her footsteps; but when he reached the
                     Hall, he found her kneeling by the couch of her mother. Madam Bonnifleur had
                     been seized with a sudden illness: a physician was sent for, and when he
                     arrived he declared her to be dying.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" she murmured faintly, "how can I die and leave my poor child? What will
                     become of her?"</p>
                  <p>"I will care for her as I would for my own soul," said the professor.</p>
                  <p>Madam Bonnifleur closed her eyes: a silvery mist floated before them, and she
                     saw again the familiar face that had haunted her in her dreams.</p>
                  <p>"No," she whispered, "the roses will take care of Violetta;" and her weary
                     spirit obeyed the voice<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6310-00000040"/> which called
                     her away to the land where the flowers never fade.</p>
                  <p>As the professor turned toward Violetta, he was awe-struck at her appearance;
                     for she stood with clasped hands gazing upward, as though she saw the spirit of
                     the departed. And again, with that strange expression of countenance, she
                     repeated the words, "It is the Beautiful, the Altogether Lovely!" He shuddered
                     as he saw the necklace of diamonds flashing upon her neck and bosom. How
                     unfitting it was at such a time! and, reaching forth his hand, he gently
                     unclasped it, and laid it aside.</p>
                  <p>Poor Violetta bowed like a stricken lily, and wept till it seemed as though the
                     fountain of tears was exhausted; but when all was finished, and Madam
                     Bonnifleur slept beside her husband under the "La belle Flora," Violetta's
                     calm, untroubled sweetness returned to her, and she went about her duties as
                     usual.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                  <p>A FEW weeks after the death of Madam Bonnifleur, the professor sat alone one
                     morning in his library, deeply absorbed in reading some scientific work. A hand
                     was laid lightly on his arm; and, looking up, he beheld Violetta standing
                     beside him, with her shawl and bonnet on. She was very pale, and her voice
                     trembled as she spoke. "I have come to bid you goodby," she said.</p>
                  <p>The professor started to his feet. "What do you mean, Violetta? and where are
                     you going?"</p>
                  <p>"I am going to Paris to make flowers."</p>
                  <p>"What for?"</p>
                  <p>"Because I have staid here as long as I ought. Another will serve you just as
                     well, perhaps better."</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" said the professor, with almost a groan: "is there no persuasion, no word
                     of entreaty, which I can call up from the deep places of my heart, that can
                     induce you to stay? Have I not always treated you kindly? Have I not
                     sympathized with you in your sorrows? and did I not promise your dying mother
                     that I would care for you as I would for my own soul? Violetta, I would lay
                     down my very life for your sake; and will you go away and leave me?"</p>
                  <p>She looked up in his face, and saw all the deep emotions of his noble and
                     generous heart written there. Her resolution almost failed her; and, bursting
                     into tears, she wept like a child. "You will not go, Violetta," he said kindly:
                     "I know you will not."</p>
                  <p>"I must," she replied: "indeed I must. You have been very kind to me, and I
                     wish, for your sake, that in return I might become all you would have me; but
                     the power is not in me to do so. I shall always be a child in heart. If I stay
                     here, you will not be happy; but, if I go away, you will only miss me for a
                     little time, and then you will seek the company of those who are your equals in
                     wealth and intellect. Good-by; and may God bless you!"</p>
                  <p>She waited one moment, but he did not speak: he only bowed his face in his
                     hands, and rested them upon the table. He sat thus some time, and then he
                        lifted<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6310-00000041"/> his head suddenly, as though
                     a new thought had come to him.</p>
                  <p>"Violetta," said he; but he spoke only to the air. She was gone. He rang the
                     bell violently. "Allan," said he to the servant, "have you seen Violetta?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir: she has just gone down the avenue, and taken the coach for the
                     city." The professor sat and thought an hour longer; and the conclusion of the
                     whole matter was, that he firmly resolved to overcome his feelings, to resume
                     his studies, and win back his former dignity and composure by returning again
                     to those scenes and associations in which he had formerly found so much
                     enjoyment. The next day he dined in London, attended the Lady Arabella to the
                     opera, and received an invitation to the large and fashionable party which she
                     intended to give the following week.</p>
                  <p>Never was there a more fascinating being than the Lady Arabella. Her wealth,
                     her beauty, and her accomplishments, won for her a host of admirers; but she
                     had also good sense, a cheerful temperament, and a kind heart. She was
                     perfectly independent in her associations, and spoke her thoughts freely. The
                     professor found great pleasure in her conversation, and forgot all the
                     troublesome memories of the past when he sat and listened to her sweet voice,
                     as she played upon the piano and sang his favorite songs. She, too, was
                     flattered by his attentions. His great intellectual endowments, his courteous
                     manners, and his real goodness of heart, were worth far more to her than the
                     silly flatteries of the wealthy and titled admirers who flocked around her. In
                     the course of time, therefore, the "fashionable intelligence" contained hints
                     of an engagement; and finally the long-expected marriage appeared in full, and
                     the professor, with his beautiful bride, departed on the wedding-tour. A year
                     passed by in all the enjoyment that wealth and affection could impart, and
                     Mildmay Hall still awaited the return of its possessor.</p>
                  <p>It was an uncommonly gay winter in Paris, but the party of the Countess La
                     Valette was to be the most brilliant affair of the season. All the "<foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">bon ton</foreign>" and "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">beau
                        monde</foreign>" were to be present. The Lady Arabella stood before her
                     mirror in full dress for the important occasion; and as the professor looked
                     upon her with admiring eyes, his heart was filled with pride at her wonderful
                     beauty. She was arrayed in elegant white satin; and the magnificent diamonds
                     which she wore, the gift of the professor, gave her the air and majesty of a
                     queen. But, as he gazed at her, his eye chanced to rest upon the exquisite
                     flower which she wore among the rich braids of her hair.</p>
                  <p>"Arabella," he exclaimed, "where did you obtain that flower?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" she replied, "is it not beautiful? It is one that my maid got for me
                     somewhere in the city. You know that Clari is very much interested in making me
                     appear to the best advantage; and, as she was passing through one of the
                     streets, she saw a rosebush standing in a window, all covered with these
                     beautiful blossoms. She inquired for the owner, and found she was a poor
                     flower-artiste; but she could not induce her to part with one of her roses at
                     any price, till she chanced to mention my name, when she gave her one very
                     willingly, refusing to take any thing in return."</p>
                  <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6310-00000042"/>
                  <p>"Arabella," said the professor very decidedly, "that is a bud of the 'La belle
                     Flora;' and the owner of the bush can be no other than Violetta."</p>
                  <p>"What! the beautiful daughter of Madam Bonnifleur, who used to live at the
                     Hall? How happened she to leave you? I really loved her the first time I saw
                     her, she was so pure and gentle."</p>
                  <p>The professor sat down beside her, and told her the whole story of Violetta,
                     from the commencement. He was really glad to do so, for it had weighed heavily
                     on his heart. All the generous sympathies of the lady were awakened, and she
                     wept as she listened.</p>
                  <p>"If Violetta is in Paris," she exclaimed, as he ended, "I will find her. We
                     will take her home with us, and I will love her as a sister." Just then the
                     carriage stopped at the door which was to convey them to the
                     brilliantly-lighted rooms of the countess, and for the time Violetta was
                     forgotten.</p>
                  <p>The next day, however, the first thought that entered the Lady Arabella's mind,
                     as she saw the withered flower lying upon the table, was of Violetta. After
                     inquiring very carefully of her maid, she started, accompanied by the
                     professor, in search of the house, to which Clari could not give any very
                     satisfactory directions. They soon found it, however; and there, sure enough,
                     was the "La belle Flora," blooming in a pot which set in an open window.</p>
                  <p>"Madam," said the professor to the woman who appeared at the door in answer to
                     his knock, "is there a young lady residing here by the name of Violetta?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said the woman, who had evidently been weeping; "and if you are friends
                     of the poor girl, and wish to see her, you had best come in before it is too
                     late. The dear, good creature! It is almost over with her. She has not been
                        <emph>able</emph> to work so steady as she has for this long time; but she
                     was patient and persevering to the last."</p>
                  <p>She opened the door of the neatly-furnished room, and there, upon her couch,
                     lay Violetta. Her hands were clasped closely together, her hair was thrown back
                     on the pillow, and her breath came fast through the parted lips.</p>
                  <p>"Violetta," said the professor, in a low tone.</p>
                  <p>She turned her large blue eyes slowly toward him. A smile of angelic sweetness
                     spread over her pale features, and she faintly pressed the hand he gave
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"O you dear, sweet child!" said the Lady Arabella, as she bent over her and
                     kissed her. "Have I, indeed, come too late? How happy I should have been to
                     have taken you home to your roses again, and loved you as my own dear
                     sister!"</p>
                  <p>"Will you take me home to my roses again, dear lady?" whispered Violetta; and
                     she looked up entreatingly in her face.</p>
                  <p>"Surely I will, dear child."</p>
                  <p>Her eyes wandered about the room, as if in search of something. In an instant
                     the Lady Arabella anticipated her wishes, and placed the "La belle Flora" upon
                     the little table beside her. The professor raised her in his arms, and she
                     gazed upon it a few moments; then there came again that celestial brightness
                     which he had seen beaming upon her face in the sunset light.</p>
                  <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6310-00000043"/>
                  <p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, "it is the Beautiful, the Altogether Lovely!"</p>
                  <p>There came a quivering breath; her head sank upon his bosom, and the pure
                     spirit departed.</p>
                  <p>"Yes: we will take her back again to the roses," said the Lady Arabella, as she
                     wept like a child over the pale, still face. "She was as innocent and beautiful
                     as they; and now they shall watch over her, who tended and loved them so
                     well."</p>
                  <p>In a few weeks there was a new grave under the "La bella Flora," and near the
                     grave was a fair, white monument. Upon the top knelt the figure of a young girl
                     with uplifted countenance; and underneath was inscribed,— <q>
                        <p>"VIOLETTA.<lb/> It is the Beautiful, the Altogether Lovely!"</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The secret inspiration of her life and action still remained a profound mystery
                     to the wise professor; but the key is simple,—"Blessed are the pure in heart,
                     for they shall see God;" and the soul of the beautiful <emph>is</emph> God.</p>

               <p>PROFESSOR WILBERFORCE, the phrenological lecturer, was peculiarly and somewhat
                  unpleasantly situated. As unwittingly as a bird hops into a snare, had he come to
                  Banbury, and advertised a course of lectures. He had never before visited the
                  place, and had heard nothing concerning the reputation of its inhabitants.
                  Supposing it to stand, however, in fair comparison with other suburban towns, he
                  felt no dread of criticism or rivalry, but entered upon his work with a sense of
                  perfect security and a happy consciousness of his own ability. He did not know,
                  however, that the place contained a Lyceum, a Young Men's Literary Institute, a
                  Debating Society, a Shakspeare Club, and a Public Library; that every winter the
                  inhabitants had generously sustained a course of scientific and literary lectures,
                  for which men of the highest order of talent and intellectual attainment in the
                  land were engaged;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6310-00000044"/> that Banbury had
                  furnished to the world an unequaled number of teachers, preachers, doctors, and
                  lawyers; and that, in proportion to its size and number of inhabitants, no other
                  place subscribed so freely for scientific and literary works as this.</p>
               <p>Of all this he was profoundly ignorant. He did not know, moreover, that
                  Dr.Sweetzer, the most noted physiologist in the country, had here given a course
                  of lectures, which was "numerously attended," and by unanimous request repeated;
                  also that many lectures which had been highly extolled in other places had been
                  pronounced all "highfalutin and flummery" by the critics of Banbury; and, finally,
                  that jugglers, mountebanks, circuses, traveling theaters, Ethiopian minstrels, and
                  organ-grinders, found little encouragement among this refined and cultivated
                  people. But there was one fact of still greater importance to the professor, of
                  which he was wholly unaware, and we now intrust it as a profound secret to the
                  reader.</p>
               <p>Banbury had been, for the last four or five years, the residence of Miss Sarah
                  Fairfield, who was formerly the "lady elect" of the professor. As a young man of
                  eighteen, and a college student, he had formed this his first attachment. For a
                  time, he was deeply devoted to the object of his choice; but the incidental
                  discovery that she was not only a poetess, but a Greek and Latin student, greatly
                  disturbed the current of his love. He remonstrated; but the lady persisted.
                  Finally, after giving the subject sufficient consideration, he informed her, that,
                  unless she confined herself more strictly to the usual order of female pursuits,
                  he should be obliged to seek association elsewhere. She replied, with a quiet
                  smile, that he was perfectly at liberty to do so. Greatly incensed by her apparent
                  indifference, he so far forgot himself as, to call her "a blue," and prophesied
                  for her future lot that of an "ambitious old maid." This, however, seemed to amuse
                  rather than offend her. He therefore left her to her fate, firmly determined in
                  himself never to seek the association of a literary, educated woman again.</p>
               <p>In pursuance of his resolution, and to heal his wounded pride, he plunged at once
                  into the midst of female society, and, ere long, selected as his future companion
                  Miss Mary Lester, a girl of sixteen, with scarcely the elements of a common-school
                  education, yet possessed of a most bewitching style of beauty. He subsequently
                  married her, and removed to a location far distant from his native place. From
                  that time forth, he lost all account of his first love, save hearing incidentally,
                  that, after the prescribed course of study, she had graduated from the Female
                  Medical College, and settled, in the exercise of her profession, in some country
                  town: he never heard precisely where. More than ten years had now elapsed since he
                  had seen her face. During that time, his own willful but sorely-tried wife had
                  found a refuge from their mutual disagreements in the grace; and the professor,
                  fearing that another matrimonial attempt would produce a like result, had for
                  several years walked the thorny path of life alone. He had continued for some time
                  to lecture, quite acceptably, from place to place, until, by the great current of
                  human events and the railroad track, he at length reached Banbury, wholly
                  unconscious of what there awaited him. He had posted his bills, hired his hall,
                  arranged his busts, skulls, charts,<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6310-00000045"/>
                  &amp;c., in scientific order, and upon the appointed evening made his appearance
                  before a "highly respectable audience."</p>
               <p>At the commencement of his lecture, as was his custom, he proffered the liberty to
                  his hearers to interrupt him at any point, with questions or objections, as they
                  deemed proper; not having the least idea that they would avail themselves of the
                  privilege. He had chosen for the subject of his first lecture, "The Brain and its
                  Functions," and had proceeded without interruption till he had about completed
                  two-thirds of his discourse, when he began to enlarge, with some ability and much
                  eloquence, upon the organ of consciousness, situated in that inner sanctuary of
                  the brain, the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">sensorium,</foreign> or <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">medulla oblongata.</foreign> He felt that he was making a great
                  impression upon his hearers, when an individual rose from his seat, and asked if
                  this organ of consciousness, which held such undisputed sway over the whole body,
                  could be properly termed the seat of the human soul.</p>
               <p>The professor drew down his gold-bowed spectacles nearly to the tip of his nose,
                  and looked over them at his interrogator. He was surprised that such an inquiry
                  should have originated with such an individual; for no one would ever have
                  supposed it possible from his appearance. A pair of sleepy eyes, a large mouth, a
                  low, receding forehead, above which the hair was combed straight down and cut
                  directly across, while the hinder portion was left to grow as long as it might,
                  formed the sum total of this individual's attractions, unless his drawling tone
                  and extremely ungraceful attitude should also be taken into account. The professor
                  felt it hardly worth while to reply; but, out of respect to his audience, he did
                  so.</p>
               <p>That, he said, could not be easily determined. Scientific men, philosophers, and
                  theologians, all disagreed as to the nature and location of the human soul. As for
                  himself, he could find no better theory than that which he had advanced; and,
                  until he had more light upon the subject, he should believe that the <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">sensorium</foreign> was the seat of government for the soul.</p>
               <p>"Well, then," continued his questioner, "will you inform me whether this human
                  soul (or what do you call it?) is dependent upon a compound material organ, or is
                  in itself a single indestructible atom, which has the eternal power of
                  consciousness?"</p>
               <p>Now, this was, of all questions, the very one which the professor disliked to hear
                  asked, because it presented one of those singular dilemmas reputed to have two
                  horns, upon either of which he did not like to risk his reputation. If he said
                  that the soul depended upon a compound, material organ, then it naturally followed
                  that death would decompose it, and thus subvert at once the doctrine of
                  immortality. But if, on the other hand, he declared it to be an indestructible
                  atom, endowed with eternal consciousness, then he assumed a position which he
                  could neither prove nor maintain, as it was a question which science found it
                  impossible to decide. He did not like, either, that such a stupid-looking
                  individual should make him confess his ignorance before so large an audience. His
                  first impulse was to apply his hand to his head, after the manner of a puzzled
                  schoolboy; but a sense of decorum restrained him. He glanced up at the portraits
                  of Gall, Spurzheim, Franklin<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6310-00000046"/> lin,
                  Swedenborg, and others, which ornamented the walls; but they could not assist him.
                  He took a drink from the glass of water on his stand; but that proved equally
                  useless. Finally, he pushed his spectacles nervously up to his eyes again, seized
                  his manuscript, and, saying very abruptly that he "didn't know," resumed his
                  discourse at once.</p>
               <p>"Fifthly and lastly, gentlemen and ladies," he continued, "I will briefly present
                  to you one other important point in my subject. I have shown you the difference
                  existing in the brain, both in respect to quantity and degree of development, as
                  it is found in all classes of animals, until we come to the human race, the
                  crowning glory of creation. Here, also, we find a great difference existing in the
                  cerebral development of male and female. God evidently intended each for
                     <emph>his</emph> or <emph>her</emph> own peculiar sphere; and the part of
                  wisdom is to acknowledge this, and to live wholly in it."</p>
               <p>"That can't always be done!" exclaimed a little nervous individual, belonging to
                  the genus <foreign xml:lang="LAT">homo,</foreign> who looked decidedly
                  "henpecked:" there's the force of circumstances, and <emph>other forces,</emph>
                  which often drive a man from his sphere; and, if the Lord intended a particular
                  position for each, I devoutly wish he'd help us maintain it."</p>
               <p>The murmur of suppressed laughter which ran through the hall seemed to remind the
                  little man that he was "talking in meeting;" for he glanced round with a look of
                  surprise, and "subsided" immediately. The professor himself could hardly suppress
                  a smile, although he felt annoyed at the interruption. He proceeded, however,
                  without reply.</p>
               <p>"Woman," he resumed, "was evidently created a dependent being, and however
                  humiliating the fact may be to some, yet, nevertheless, it is true that in every
                  particular, except that of affection, she is inferior to man, who alone can be
                  properly termed 'the lord of creation.' Therefore the advice which Paul gave to
                  wives, concerning obedience, was wholly in accordance with the laws of nature.
                  Should a woman become forgetful of this, however, and for a time usurp a brief
                  authority, she at once loses that peculiar delicacy and refinement, that
                  inexpressible softness and sensibility, which render her so charming in the eyes
                  of her male companion."</p>
               <p>"That's a <emph>fact!</emph>" said the little man, with an emphasis of which he
                  seemed wholly unconscious.</p>
               <p>"Neither," continued the professor, "can woman become a philosopher. Generally
                  speaking, science, art, philosophy, open their broad fields of wisdom to man
                  alone; and, when a woman attempts to invade their domain, she is reminded of her
                  weakness and inefficiency at every step. She can not arrange her ideas in a clear,
                  logical sequence. Although by a certain <emph>quickness,</emph> not
                     <emph>strength,</emph> of perception, she may seize upon an effect, and by
                  analysis trace it back to its cause, yet she can not continue the circle, and by
                  synthesis come back again to the point of beginning. Somewhere or other in all of
                  woman's reasoning there is an are wanting: she can not complete the circle."</p>
               <p>"Do you know of any one that can?" asked a sedate old gentleman, who had thrown
                  his red silk handkerchief over his head to shield his denuded crown from the
                  current of air proceeding from a neighboring window.</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6310-00000047"/>
               <p>The professor was vexed at these frequent interruptions, and therefore he answered
                  very curtly, "Yes, I do."</p>
               <p>"Who, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I can," replied the professor, with a look and tone which were intended to settle
                  the matter at once.</p>
               <p>"Well, then," continued the determined old gentleman, "I will take you on your own
                  ground. Supposing, for instance, that a man takes a leap in the dark, directly
                  into a brier-bush; according to your philosophy, the nerves of sensation carry the
                  intelligence directly to his brain."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"Then, to complete the work, the organ of consciousness acts upon the nerves of
                  motion, and proceeds at once to liberate the man from his unhappy situation."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"Well, now, the whole train of events, from the first invasion of the bush, to the
                  man's liberation, forms a complete circle. Yet science, according to your own
                  confession, loses an important arc in that circle. It is not complete. In that
                  little inner chamber of the brain, between the nerves of sensation and motion,
                  there is a space, where, by your own hypothesis, the soul resides; but you can not
                  say whether that soul may be an inspired atom of matter, a gas, a fluid, or an
                  ethereal essence. There is where <emph>your</emph> circle is incomplete; and you
                  can only subtend that missing arc by the poor chord of a supposition, which future
                  investigations may rend asunder at any moment."</p>
               <p>"Sir," said the professor, with much solemnity, "when you and I meet in that world
                  where all such mysteries are revealed, then I will give you the missing arc, then
                  the circle shall be completed."</p>
               <p>"Very well," replied the old gentleman; "<emph>but that isn't the point.</emph>
                  You were saying that woman could not complete a logical circle. When, then, you
                  perceive your own fallibility, you should not parade your superiority. We are all
                  of us obliged to confess that our mothers were women; and that very fact should
                  lead us to speak of the whole female sex with gratitude, if not with
                  admiration."</p>
               <p>"Very true," replied the professor, as the meek countenance of his own departed
                  mother passed before his mental vision; and, without further remark, he returned
                  at once to his lecture.</p>
               <p>"There is one point, at least," he recommenced, "upon which you will certainly
                  agree with me. As far as physical strength is concerned, man is greatly superior
                  to woman; he has more decision and energy of character, and is possessed of a
                  greater power of endurance."</p>
               <p>"Sir," said a pleasant female voice; and at the same time, a lady, simply but
                  elegantly dressed, rose from her seat not far from the speaker's stand.</p>
               <p>"There," thought the professor, "is a strong-minded woman;" and he turned a sharp,
                  half-contemptuous glance upon her, for he had always had a peculiar horror of
                  such. What was his surprise, therefore, to recognize in the person of the lady who
                  stood so calmly before him his former "lady-love," Miss Sarah Fairfield! The past
                  which lay beyond those ten long years of separation rushed upon him with a
                  bewildering force, and he almost lost his self-possession.</p>
               <p>"You will please allow me," she continued, "to say<pb n="94-95"
                     xml:id="VAC6310-00000048"/> somewhat upon the point last presented. As far as
                  muscular strength is concerned, man entirely has the advantage; in decision and
                  energy of character, he is often superior, but not always: but in point of
                  endurance, both physical and mental, woman stands pre-eminent. She has long been
                  called the 'weaker sex;' but when I see her restricted from the air and
                  out-of-door employments, and confined to the wearisome toil of the needle, or the
                  endless monotony of household arrangements; when I see her go more thinly clad
                  than man, and burdened with fashions which cramp and destroy her, in body and
                  soul,—then I can not but wonder at the strength of a constitution which is
                  apparently so delicate. She also meets pain, deprivation, long-continued exertion,
                  watching, and anxiety, with a courage and constancy worthy of all admiration. The
                  woman who, under ordinary circumstances, has become the mother of three, four, or
                  five children, nurtured and reared them, attended upon them through all the
                  various ills and accidents incidental to childhood and youth, and at the same time
                  has faithfully sustained her relation as a wife and member of the great human
                  family, has passed through a course of discipline, a fiery ordeal, which a hero of
                  the Crusades could scarce equal. I say not this to exalt my own sex, but that
                  these husbands, fathers, sons, and brothers, who hear, may reflect, and arrive at
                  wise and equitable conclusions. Man, by his great muscular energy, and freedom
                  from the peculiar duties which Nature has appointed to woman, may build great
                  monuments of labor and strength; but woman, in the faithful discharge of her
                  relations, lays the foundation of a mighty superstructure, whose top reaches to
                  the Infinite nite, and whose grandeur and beauty none but those who see with the
                  clear, impartial eye of the Spirit can behold."</p>
               <p>Miss Fairfield took her seat; and Professor W——, with a very polite bow, turned
                  directly to his manuscript. He finished his discourse with nervous haste,
                  recommended to the attention of purchasers his last literary work, entitled
                  "Sciomachy, or a Battle with a Shadow," being a complete exposition and overthrow
                  of "Modern Spiritualism," and then, thanking his audience for their <emph>polite

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>THE professor did not rest well that night. His sleep was disturbed with dreams
                     of unsuccessful lectures and censorious audiences; and his waking hours were
                     filled with visions of the past, which, in the clear "moonlight of memory,"
                     seemed almost like reality. Sarah Fairfield's face was again before him, her
                     voice in his ears; and his whole soul yearned for that companionship which he
                     had so blindly rejected in the past. Experience had taught him, that it was not
                     enough to marry a mender of his garments and a sharer of his food and shelter.
                     His noble and better nature required a counterpart; not only an intimate, but a
                     pure communion: and, setting aside his horror of strong-minded women and
                     literary blues, he felt that only with a refined and cultivated female nature
                     could he find the sympathy<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6310-00000049"/> which he
                     desired. Sarah Fairfield alone seemed the impersonation of his ideal; but his
                     pride, like a threatening monster, stood between them.</p>
                  <p>"What has possessed me!" he exclaimed at length. "I feel as if under the
                     influence of enchantment." He seized a pitcher of water, and plentifully
                     deluged his head, hoping thereby to cool the fever of his brain; but it availed
                     little, for he could find no rest. Observing at length that the crimson flush
                     of morning was fast overspreading the sky, he hastily arrayed himself, and went
                     forth for an early walk. The clear, cool air was truly refreshing. The trees
                     were laden with blossoms, and the birds had already begun their cheerful
                     songs.</p>
                  <p>Not heeding whither he went, the professor strolled leisurely onward, until he
                     came to a picturesque cottage, standing apart from the main road, and embowered
                     in trees and flowering shrubs. It suited his taste exactly. He leaned over the
                     front gate in silent admiration, viewed the garden beds, with their neat
                     evergreen borders, and tasteful arrangement of flowers.</p>
                  <p>"Can you tell me who owns this place?" he asked of a rude countryman, who just
                     then went whistling by.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Fairfield, sir, our doctor woman. Tell ye what, she's got a power o'
                     money! She goes from Dan to Beersheba a taking care o' the sick; and there
                     ain't a physicianer anywhere round that can beat her. Lord bless her! When my
                     Abby Jane was sick with the croup, there was three of your common doctors that
                     couldn't do the lessest thing in the world for her: so we sent for Miss
                     Fairfield, and she had her up in less than no time. And, what do you think! she
                     never took a cent for it, not a cent! 'Cause she knew I was poor, and found it
                     hard work to live anyhow. Tell ye what! there's a woman for ye!"</p>
                  <p>With another fervently ejaculated "Lord bless her!" he commenced whistling his
                     tune again, and walked briskly away.</p>
                  <p>The professor sighed deeply; and, lost in profound meditation, he wandered
                     slowly back to his lodgings. On the whole, however, he felt much better for his
                     walk. He ate his breakfast with a good relish, and then sat down to read the
                     morning papers, which had just been handed in. The first one he took up was
                     "The Banbury Signal," a weekly paper of no small pretensions. He glanced
                     carelessly over the columns, until his eyes chanced to fall upon a poem, which
                     immediately arrested his attention. The emotion which he manifested in reading
                     it arose from no slight cause. The poem ran thus:—</p>

                  <p>"Is it possible!" exclaimed the professor, as he finished reading, and threw
                     down the paper with a flushed countenance. "She well understood that she aimed
                     a poisoned arrow at me when she wrote that. Oh! how I have allowed my
                     imagination to deceive me concerning her! But, for my own sake, I will now face
                     this unwomanly woman. I will look at her with the eyes of my judgment, and not
                     of my heart, and tell her plainly how lightly I esteem her."</p>
                  <p>He drew out his watch hastily, and looked at it; but it had stopped. "Here,
                     waiter, here!" he exclaimed, as he rung the bell with a nervous twitch. "What
                     time is it?"</p>
                  <p>"Just nine o'clock, sir."</p>
                  <p>"All right." He folded up the paper containing the offensive poem, and,
                     thrusting it into his pocket, started off immediately. Professor Wilberforce
                     entered that little front gate, and walked up the garden-path, with the air of
                     a man who wasn't afraid of anybody. His ring at the door—also very decided in
                     character—was answered by a servant-girl, who ushered him into a small, but
                     elegantly furnished parlor. While the girl went to speak to her mistress, the
                     professor improved the opportunity to make various arrangements of his hair and
                     necktie. He also drew down his shirt-sleeves, so that the gold sleeve-buttons
                     were plainly discernible; and, taking off his right hand glove, he thrust it
                     into his pocket, as there were sundry rips in it which betrayed the need of
                     female handiwork. He had scarcely done this, when Miss Fairfield entered. The
                     professor rose very stiffly; but she greeted him so cordially, and entered into
                     conversation with such apparent ease and interest, that he found it impossible
                     to commence his animadversions.</p>
                  <p>"We have not met for many years," she said; "and although time has dealt kindly
                     by me, yet I believe that you have met with at least one sad bereavement."</p>
                  <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6310-00000051"/>
                  <p>"Yes," replied the professor, looking very uncomfortable.</p>
                  <p>"I felt deeply for you when I heard of it; for, although Mary was much younger
                     than myself, I always found her a lively, interesting companion, as easily
                     molded and influenced as a child. Some three or four years after her death, I
                     visited the town of K——, and went into the graveyard to find her last
                     resting-place. I sought a long time, but all in vain, and was obliged to come
                     away disappointed. Does a stone mark the spot?"</p>
                  <p>"Well—no"—replied the professor, with much hesitation. "I—I—thought of sending
                     to Italy to have one carved expressly; but—circumstances did not admit, and
                     therefore I have deferred it."</p>
                  <p>"That is a matter of small import," said Miss Fairfield, endeavoring to relieve
                     his embarrassment. "Where the memory of the loved is deeply enshrined in the
                     heart, no monument is needed to mark the place of rest. Mary was always so
                     confiding and affectionate, that you must have felt her loss deeply."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said the professor, in a very absent manner: "if I recollect aright, I
                     think I did."</p>
                  <p>His fair hearer opened her eyes with astonishment. The truth was, the professor
                     was so earnestly engaged in considering the way whereby he might bring out the
                     obnoxious poem, that he was altogether unmindful of his words. He looked up
                     quickly, and their eyes met. Vexed with himself, and embarrassed beyond all
                     measure, he made a desperate effort at self-possession, and, drawing the paper
                     from his pocket, asked her at once if she was the author of the poem.</p>
                  <p>"I am," she replied gently, "although I can not imagine how you could have
                     supposed it."</p>
                  <p>"What!" exclaimed the professor in astonishment, "did not the little incident
                     here mentioned, that of writing upon the window, occur in our early
                     association; and can I doubt, therefore, that you wrote this intentionally,
                     knowing it would come to my eye?"</p>
                  <p>Miss Fairfield laughed. "I had not the slightest idea," she said, "that it
                     would ever meet your observation; and, even if it did, I had no misgivings upon
                     the subject. The incident to which you refer, truly did happen in our early
                     association; but, further than that, the comparison should not be carried out.
                     The poem was written for the benefit of a young cousin, who was about to
                     sacrifice herself to a man of a dazzling, highly cultivated intellect, but of a
                     cold, selfish heart. Whether I employed my pen usefully, or to a commendable
                     purpose, I leave you to decide."</p>
                  <p>"Let me assure you, also, in this connection," she added, as a light flush
                     overspread her countenance, "that my feelings toward you are of the kindest,
                     most friendly nature. I respect your character, admire your genius, and believe
                     in your moral sincerity."</p>
                  <p>The professor felt his heart almost ready to melt before her truthful glance;
                     but he resolved not to yield.</p>
                  <p>"No," he replied, as he shook his head doubtfully, and, rising from his seat,
                     looked down upon her in all his dignity. "You must not wonder if I hesitate to
                     receive the words of a woman, who, for the sake of ambitious aims or paltry
                     gain, has subverted that pure affection with which God has endowed her for the
                     holiest of purposes, in order to give place to the bewildering manifestations
                     of the intellect. In this last ten years, you may have accomplished all that
                     for which you<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6310-00000052"/> aimed; but to love—the
                     satisfaction, the exaltation, and completion of a woman's nature—you are yet a
                     stranger. Let me tell you," he added, with a sharpness of which he was scarcely
                     aware, "'God has given you the desire of your heart, but sent leanness into
                     your soul.'"</p>
                  <p>"O Marcus, Marcus Wilberforce!" she exclaimed, as she looked up with a pale
                     face and tearful eyes, "you tread roughly upon a bleeding heart. I have and do
                     now know what it is to love with all the power of my nature. You do most
                     cruelly misjudge and misunderstand me."</p>
                  <p>She ceased speaking, and covered her face with her hands to conceal her
                     emotion. The professor was surprised; but suddenly a thought flashed upon him,
                     which quickened his pulses to a feverish speed. Could it be that he was the
                     object of that affection? that through all these long, weary years, she had
                     concealed this attachment in her heart, and turned to intellectual pursuits as
                     a refuge from the sorrow within? He felt an instantaneous conviction of this;
                     and, scarce knowing what he did, he threw himself upon his knees beside her,
                     and, seizing her hands in his, he kissed them with unrestrained fervor.</p>
                  <p>"Why, Professor Wilberforce!" she exclaimed, with a look of surprise, not
                     unmingled with alarm, "what do you mean?"</p>
                  <p>"Sarah, dear Sarah!" he replied, "cast aside your pride, now and for ever! By a
                     feeling of the tenderest sympathy, I have read your secret; and though I am all
                     unworthy of your love, yet I take it to myself as eagerly as a miser would a
                     newly-discovered treasure."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no, no!" she answered quickly: "I did not intend to mislead you. It is
                     another whom I love, another;" and a crimson flush overspread her
                     countenance.</p>
                  <p>"Then," said the professor, as he rose to his feet, with some embarrassment, "I
                     have behaved foolishly; yet nevertheless I will not take back my word. I do
                     love and esteem you as a clear-minded, true-hearted woman; and, if I can not be
                     happy with you, I will at least rejoice in seeing you happy with another."</p>
                  <p>"God only knows when that will be," she replied with a gush of tears; "for my
                     hopes have been darkened of late."</p>
                  <p>"Will you not, at the least, grant me your confidence?" said the professor.</p>
                  <p>"I will. Five years since, I pledged my heart's best affections to Howard
                     Elliston. He was a man whom I could respect as well as love. His integrity of
                     character and soundness of principle won my entire confidence. But he was a
                     poor man. Too proud to claim me as his bride while thus situated, or to receive
                     any advantage from my attainments, he crossed the ocean to seek his fortune.
                     For some time, sickness and evil accidents attended him; then he wrote more
                     hopefully, and told of his prospects of speedy success. It is now nearly a
                     year, however, that I have heard nothing, and can gain no intelligence
                     concerning him. If he is yet upon the face of the earth, he will return to me;
                     but, if not, my heart shall rest in the grave with him."</p>
                  <p>For some moments the two sat in silence together.</p>
                  <p>"How is it," at length asked the professor, "that you can yet attend faithfully
                     to your duties, with this burden upon your heart?"</p>
                  <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6310-00000053"/>
                  <p>"Because I remember, that, aside from my own selfish interests and desires, I
                     am also a child of God, a member of the great human family; that I have a work
                     to do in the world, and that my true happiness does not depend so much upon any
                     earthly union or enjoyment as upon doing the work which the Lord hath appointed
                     to me. Thus do I go on, leaning, when faint and weary, upon the bosom of my
                     heavenly Father, and ever cherishing the hope, that, when I have borne this
                     inward cross sufficiently long, I shall receive the crown of rejoicing."</p>
                  <p>"O my God, my God!" said the professor earnestly and reverently, "what is the
                     wisdom of the world compared to that which thou dost bestow upon simple and
                     childlike hearts!"</p>
                  <p>There came a sharp, quick ring at the door, next a hasty step, and then a tall,
                     sun-burned stranger stood before them.</p>
                  <p>"Howard!" exclaimed Miss Fairfield as she sprang forward, and he received her
                     fainting in his arms. The strong woman who <q>

                        </lg>
                     </q> was wholly overcome by the force of her affections.</p>
                  <p>The professor, moved by a sense of propriety, after expressing his friendly
                     congratulations, withdrew, leaving the joyful traveler alone with "her whom his
                     soul loved," to tell the tale of his shipwreck while homeward bound, of his
                     weary wanderings, and his final success and safety.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <p>THE inhabitants of Banbury were much better pleased with the succeeding
                     lectures on phrenology than with the first. In fact, the professor was most
                     eminently successful, although he labored with a heavy heart.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Silas Wilkinson, the sedate old gentleman who had worn the red
                     handkerchief, and described the logical circle upon the first evening, became
                     his warm personal friend. He invited him to his house, and introduced him to
                     his niece, Miss Katie Fay, a young woman some twenty three or four years of
                     age, who was studying under the direction of Miss Fairfield. She, in her turn,
                     invited him to take tea with them, which accordingly he did, and was treated to
                     such nice muffins and custards of Miss Katie's own making, that he scarce knew
                     which to admire most, the young lady or her culinary skill. She was, moreover,
                     so agreeable in conversation, and gave such evidences of a cultivated mind,
                     that, to use his own terms, he felt himself not only "physically strengthened,
                     but psychologically attracted, and spiritually exalted, by the association." He
                     made a phrenological examination of her head, which he found to be very
                     harmoniously developed, and also furnished her with a chart, and a copy of his
                     "Sciomachy, or a Battle with a Shadow." He moreover promised her various other
                     scientific works and all the information he could possibly furnish on the
                     subject of phrenology, as she was greatly interested, and thought that possibly
                     she might want to lecture upon that and kindred sciences in the course of
                     time.</p>
                  <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6310-00000054"/>
                  <p>The professor bore this piece of information with the greatest equanimity,
                     although, in past time, he would much sooner thought of administering arsenic
                     than advice to a woman who contemplated such an undertaking. Miss Katie,
                     however; was weaving a web of enchantment before his eyes, and he gradually
                     became so much interested in her, that one morning, when he took up "The
                     Banbury Signal," and saw the marriage of Mr. Howard Elliston and Miss Sarah
                     Fairfield, it did not affect him half so deeply as he had expected.</p>
                  <p>He had not visited Bloomdale Cottage, as the place was called, since that first
                     eventful morning. But as he was now about leaving Banbury, and as, moreover,
                     shortly after reading the announcement of the marriage, the wedding-cards were
                     handed him, he felt called upon to do so. He deferred it, however, till within
                     a short time of his departure. He first strengthened his heart by an interview
                     with Miss Katie; and then, with a cheerfulness of spirit to which he had long
                     been a stranger, but for which he had ample reason, he started for the
                     cottage.</p>
                  <p>He found the bride dressed in simple calico, at work among her flowers in the
                     garden. There was a light to her eye, and a radiant expression upon her
                     countenance, which could only come from the overflowing joy of the heart. She
                     welcomed him cordially, and, immediately leaving her employment, invited him
                     into the little parlor which had been the scene of their former interview. So
                     interesting and animated was she in conversation, that the professor tarried
                     much longer than he had intended. At length, however, he rose to depart.</p>
                  <p>"Sarah," he said, as he extended his hand to her, "I can not leave you without
                     asking you to forgive me for the unkindly words which have passed my lips. As
                     far as <emph>you</emph> are concerned, my philosophy is entirely at fault. I
                     have found, that, both theoretically and practically, a woman can be a
                     philosopher, without detracting in any particular from her own proper and
                     peculiar nature."</p>
                  <p>"Let me tell you the secret of that," said Mrs. Elliston, as she laid her hand
                     upon his arm, and looked him earnestly in the face. "A <emph>merely</emph>
                     intellectual woman is one of the greatest perversions which can be found in the
                     universe; but such cases are exceedingly rare. You need have no infirmity of
                     faith as to woman's maintaining her proper sphere, <emph>for a power greater
                        than herself fulfills its purposes through her.</emph> Every true woman,
                     when left perfectly free to follow her intuitions and the highest law of her
                     nature, is guided by that unerring wisdom, which, to use the language of
                     Scripture, 'is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated,
                     full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hyprocrisy.'
                     When this divine and universal element is more clearly understood by man, and
                     is allowed to have its legitimate influence upon the intellectual and
                     affectional nature of woman, she will be prepared to do her duty in each and
                     every relation. Then her intellect will be made subservient to the high
                     purposes of her being, and a childlike humility will clothe her like a garment.
                     Professor Wilberforce, if you ever seek companionship again in this world
                     choose such a one, and such only."</p>
                  <p>"I—I think," stammered the professor; then, hesitating, he collected himself,
                     and spoke more calmly.</p>
                  <p>"Sarah," he resumed, "you gave me your confidence,<pb n="108-109"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000055"/> and now I will give you mine. I think I have
                     already made such a choice. This very morning has Miss Katie Fay pledged
                     herself to be mine, through weal and woe."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, indeed!" exclaimed Mrs. Elliston, "a better thing could scarce have
                     happened. You have my heart's best wishes, and God bless you both!"</p>
                  <p>The professor clasped her hand warmly, and turned away. A few hours after,
                     Banbury lay miles distant behind him; but the enlarged views and nobler
                     impulses which he had received there were still fresh and active in his heart;
                     and when, years after, Katie Fay had made his home for him the most blissful
                     spot upon the face of the earth, there was no man more strenuous in his
                     advocacy, both by word and deed, for the intellectual culture and advancement
                     of woman, than Professor Wilberforce.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                  <p>LAZILY, very lazily, stepped the camels of the rich merchant Hasupha, as, laden
                     with gold and gems, with silks and spices and aromatic gums, they approached
                     the great city of Mecca. A weary day had it been to them and their riders,
                     traveling over the scorching sands of the desert, under the cloudless sky. It
                     was not strange, indeed, that their steps were slow, even though the promised
                     rest was in sight, and the last rays of the scorching sun were shining only
                     upon the towers and minarets of the great city, and the drooping crests of the
                     lofty palms. Slowly they came; while in the midst, upon his superb Arabian
                     steed, rode Hasupha, with his hands folded upon the saddle-bow, and his head
                     bowed as if oppressed by some great sorrow. Selim, his faithful servant, rode
                     by his side; but he did not interrupt the silence of his master. There seemed
                     something so strange and unusual in his conduct, that he dared not intrude upon
                     his grief.</p>
                  <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6310-00000056"/>
                  <p>Just outside the gates of the city, as the caravan approached, a beggar sat
                     upon the ground, eating his evening meal. His garments were filthy and torn;
                     his turban hung in tatters about his head; and his long, tangled beard was
                     covered with dust and the crumbs of the food which he was eating. All day long
                     he had wandered from house to house with his goat-skin sack, begging for bits
                     of meat and broken bread; and now he seemed to be contentedly enjoying the
                     fruits of his labor. A rich perfume from the spices was wafted to him on the
                     passing breeze; and he looked up with curious eyes at the slow-moving
                     caravan.</p>
                  <p>"Righteous Allah!" he exclaimed: "what a mean thing it is to be a beggar, when
                     one sees such a sight as this! O Prophet of the faithful! if the Creator of all
                     is just, why has he made such a mighty difference between men, that one should
                     have more than heart could wish, while the other famishes for bread? Could I
                     but have the ordering of events one day, every beggar should be a rich man, and
                     I, Kufan, would be chief."</p>
                  <p>"Selim," said Hasupha, "dost thou see yonder beggar?"</p>
                  <p>"I do."</p>
                  <p>"See that he is brought to my house this night, to sup with me."</p>
                  <p>"Master, I will." And again they continued in silence. But Selim wondered much
                     at this strange command.</p>
                  <p>As they crossed the market-place, there stood the Chinese juggler, Wong Chong,
                     who had delighted the wondering crowds all day with his laughable performances
                     ances and tricks of magic. They had been greatly amused at the poor fellow's
                     expense; and now they had forsaken him, without a mouthful of bread, or a piece
                     of money to supply his need. No wonder that he was disposed to find fault with
                     all the world.</p>
                  <p>"Hi! hi!" said he, as the caravan passed him: "what is all this? A pretty show,
                     truly, to one who is starving!" And then, as he saw Hasupha noticed him, he
                     shook his head contemptuously, and made an ugly grimace. "Yes," he continued:
                     "gaze! gaze! Looks are cheap! I have been stared at, ay, and laughed at too,
                     ever since daylight. Now it is high time I had something more to my taste. Just
                     Heaven! why should one man be a servant, and another a master? Hi! hi!
                     merchant, shall I not sup with thee to-night?"</p>
                  <p>Hasupha gravely bowed his head to his horse's mane; and, in a low tone, he
                     commanded Selim to see that this man should also be brought to his house with
                     the other.</p>
                  <p>"As thou wilt," said Selim. But he began to fear that his master had taken too
                     much wine at their last resting-place.</p>
                  <p>Just round the corner of the street which they entered sat Obed the cobbler, in
                     his humble stall, with both feet cramped under him, and his head bent very low
                     to his work. Daylight was departing so rapidly, he could scarce see to set the
                     last stitches in the old sandal which he was patching; and, after that, he
                     would be obliged to go quite a distance with it, in order to obtain the money
                     wherewith to purchase his supper. This seemed the most difficult part of his
                     labor; for,<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6310-00000057"/> so long had he been
                     accustomed to sit in that uncomfortable position, that his body was bent almost
                     double, and his legs were crooked and distorted in the most painful manner.
                     This difficulty, aggravated by his hasty temper, was the chief misery of Obed's
                     life; and he felt a bitter hatred for all who were not as unfortunate as
                     himself.</p>
                  <p>"O Allah!" he muttered: "if I had been a rich man at my work, wouldst thou have
                     withdrawn they light so soon? No. But I am poor and ugly; so it matters not,
                     even though I should go without my supper! Now, if I must needs be crippled and
                     misshapen, why hadst thou not made me rich, that I might have ridden about on
                     mine own horse, and had servants to attend me? But it is always so. The rich
                     are favored, and the poor are left to shift for themselves. Ha! here comes one
                     now,—the mighty Hasupha. See how daintily he rides, hanging his head like a
                     lovesick maiden! Ho, Hasupha! wilt lend me thy horse to-night, while I go for
                     my supper?"</p>
                  <p>"Selim," said Hasupha, "let yonder cobbler be brought to my house also; but see
                     that it is done tenderly and carefully, as thou valuest my favor."</p>
                  <p>Again Selim bowed assent; but he could not refrain from smiling at the thought
                     of his master's strange guests. Now, however, they had reached their
                     destination; and, while the servants were unloading the camels, Selim hastened
                     to obey his master's commands, and Hasupha entered his house.</p>
                  <p>He was met at the door by his three beautiful wives, who were such great
                     favorites, and had been so much indulged, they were little better than spoiled
                     children. The first, Adra, was a sweet singer; Kaphira was a beautiful dancer;
                     and Urad was unrivaled in grace and loveliness.</p>
                  <p>"O Hasupha!" exclaimed Adra: "have you brought the little singing-bird you
                     promised me?"</p>
                  <p>"Where are my embroidered slippers?" said Kaphira.</p>
                  <p>"And where are my jewels?" cried out Urad at the same moment.</p>
                  <p>"Be quiet a short time," said Hasupha very gently, "and I will tell you about
                     them."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I know! My bird has flown!"</p>
                  <p>"And my slippers are lost!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes! And the robbers have stolen my jewels! Oh, what a sad thing!"</p>
                  <p>"Be very, very quiet but a short time," said Hasupha; "for I have a little
                     story which must be told even now."</p>
                  <p>So they all seated themselves about him on the rich carpet, while he rested
                     upon the cushions which their delicate hands had embroidered.</p>
                  <p>"In the heat of the noonday," commenced Hasupha, "we rested from our journey.
                     The men lay down with the camels, while I reclined under the palm-trees which
                     grew near the well in the midst of the oasis. Soon I began to fall into a
                     blissful trance, in which our holy Prophet appeared to me, with a very gracious
                     countenance.</p>
                  <p>"'Hasupha,' said he, 'Allah hath need of thee. He would make thee a teacher
                     among men. Art thou ready to do his will?'</p>
                  <p>"'O Prophet!' I exclaimed, while my whole soul<pb n="114-115"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000058"/> was moved within me, 'thou shalt find me
                     prepared to do his will in all things. Command, and I obey. But, alas! why do I
                     speak thus? How can I become a teacher, when, as yet, I am but a poor worm of
                     the dust, and know not even my own heart? Righteous Allah! teach thy servant
                     wisdom, that his lips may become eloquent with the truth!</p>
                  <p>"'Hasupha,' replied the Prophet mildly, 'let me teach thee now a simple truth.
                     The meekest and the lowliest in spirit become mightiest instruments in the
                     hands of Allah, to effect his purposes of wisdom; and the silent deed of love
                     hath a more eloquent speech than the words of the wise. Thou art well known
                     among men; and they say one to another, "Behold Hasupha! He is a faithful
                     worshiper and servant of Allah; but take away his riches, and he will become
                     base and sinful like ourselves. Give us his wealth, and we would be true like
                     Hasupha." Canst thou not teach them that thy "faith is greater than thy
                     possessions, and truth more precious than gold"?'</p>
                  <p>"'I am ready to do thy will, O Prophet! Say on.'</p>
                  <p>"'This night, at thy entering into the city, the first three whom thou shalt
                     meet, bid them unto thy house to sup with thee. To the first thou shalt give
                     thy camels and thy merchandise; to the second, thy house, thy gardens, thy
                     jewels, and all thy costly apparel; and to the third, thy gold, thy servants,
                     and thy horse. Upon the morrow thou shalt make it known to the cadi, and
                     proclaim it to the people in the market-place, as the will of the Prophet which
                     thou hast fulfilled. Then thou shalt go forth a wanderer, without money and
                     without food, trusting in Allah, who hath never forsaken thee.'</p>
                  <p>"The Prophet ceased speaking, and awaited my reply; but my heart was so heavy
                     within me that I could not speak. He turned sorrowfully away; and, in a tone
                     that pierced to my heart, he said,—</p>
                  <p>"'Farewell, then, Hasupha! I have sad tidings to bear with me to paradise.'</p>
                  <p>"'Stay, stay!' I cried. 'What is wealth without enjoyment, or life without
                     love? And if I lose the favor of Allah and his Prophet, what will my
                     possessions avail me? Take all I have, but still grant me the smile of thy
                     love!'</p>
                  <p>"He turned and gazed upon me with such a look of unspeakable tenderness, that
                     my heart still thrills at the remembrance; and then he vanished.</p>
                  <p>"Now I have told you all, and my purpose is strong to do his will. To-morrow I
                     shall be a beggar."</p>
                  <p>"Cruel Hasupha! What is to become of us?" cried all his wives at once.</p>
                  <p>"Ay! that I asked; and it was said that the choice should be given you to
                     follow me and share my poverty, or become wives to those who should possess my
                     wealth. What say you, Adra?"</p>
                  <p>But Adra could scarce speak for weeping; and, when she did, it was in a very
                     angry tone.</p>
                  <p>"Thou art a cruel, heartless wretch, Hasupha, or thou never couldst have served
                     us thus. Dost thou think I will become a ragged beggar for thy sake, when thou
                     hast so little love for me? No! I, for one, will stay and serve my new master,
                     whoever he may be."</p>
                  <p>"And so will I," said Kaphira. "How could these<pb n="116-117"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000059"/> tender little feet, which have trodden never so
                     lightly on the softest carpets, bear the wanderings of a beggar's life? No, no!
                     that will not do for me. It is well enough to talk of Allah and the Prophet;
                     but faith is not meat, and love will not keep soul and body together."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, this is all a trick to get rid of us!" said Urad spitefully. "Little does
                     such a man care for the judgments of Allah! He is worse than an infidel; and I
                     desire to have no part or lot in him!"</p>
                  <p>"Forsaken by all!" said Hasupha sorrowfully. His noble heart yearned for a love
                     worthy of its goodness; but he pitied and despised the weakness of these
                     selfish women.</p>
                  <p>"It is well," he added. "Now nothing earthly stands between me and the truth;
                     and thy love, O thou great Light of the universe, shalt suffice me!"</p>
                  <p>The sound of footsteps was heard; and Selim entered, accompanied by the invited
                     guests.</p>
                  <p>"Women," said Hasupha, "behold the lords whom ye have chosen!"</p>
                  <p>They turned their heads with a look of eager curiosity; but, at the first
                     sight, they sprang to their feet and ran shrieking from the room.</p>
                  <p>"All hail, friends!" said Hasupha, as he advanced to meet his astonished
                     guests, who stood still and gazed at him in stupid silence: "this is indeed a
                     strange bidding; but in the name and according to the will of the Prophet, do I
                     welcome you."</p>
                  <p>He called them into an adjoining room; and, bidding them be seated at the
                     table, which was loaded with an abundance of wholesome food, he invited them to
                     partake freely.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" sighed Kufan, the beggar, inwardly: "if I might sit in the dirt by
                     myself, and eat this nice bread and goat's flesh out of my old sack, with a
                     plenty of strong coffee to moisten it, how happy I should be! Rags and riches
                     are an ill-matched pair; but rags and hunger always go hand in hand." So, while
                     he was pretending to eat, he managed to conceal a large quantity of the food in
                     the folds of his garments.</p>
                  <p>Obed the cobbler thrust his thumb into his mouth, and looked on with greedy
                     eyes; but so awkward and uncomfortable did he feel, that he did not dare touch
                     a morsel. He thought of the rice and onions he had purchased for his supper at
                     home, and he wished himself back again with all his heart. But Wong Chong was
                     delighted. He shut his little seedy eyes, and opened his great mouth, and ate
                     as fast as possible. He talked familiarly with the merchant, encouraged Obed,
                     and helped the beggar most bountifully.</p>
                  <p>"Verily," said he, "this roasted kid is excellent! Hasupha, wilt thou pass me
                     over the sherbet? Come, man! take your hands from your mouth, and begin to eat.
                     Kufan, let me help thee to a little more rice and milk. Do the best you can
                     to-night, for fortune does not often favor us thus."</p>
                  <p>When they had finished, the merchant informed them that he wished for them to
                     continue in his house through the night, as he had something of importance to
                     communicate to them in the morning. Accordingly, each one was shown to a
                     handsomely furnished chamber, where, with the exception of Wong Chong, who
                     immediately fell asleep, they were as miserable as wild birds in gilded
                     cages.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>UPON the morrow, Hasupha, clothed in the plainest manner, went forth with his
                     strange companions, and made his appearance in the divan before the cadi. They
                     were all overwhelmed with astonishment when they heard him express his
                     intention of thus dividing his wealth among these worthless creatures, and
                     begged of him to consider it a little while longer. But he was resolute, and
                     therefore it was done in accordance with the law. The news of this strange
                     occurrence spread like wild-fire among the people; and when Hasupha made his
                     appearance in the market-place, still accompanied by the three, a vast
                     multitude had assembled. The rich and honored merchant, who was much beloved by
                     all the people, stood with the juggler, the cobbler, and the beggar, upon the
                     platform which had been raised for the dancers and public performers of the
                     city. There, with a solemn countenance, in a loud voice, he proclaimed the will
                     of Allah as it had been revealed to him, and called upon all the people to bear
                     him witness to the faithfulness of its performance; ending by exhorting the
                     people most earnestly to follow after righteousness and good works.</p>
                  <p>At first, there was a murmur of admiration among the crowd at his noble
                     conduct. But, in a moment, their attention was attracted by the beggar, who
                     threw his sack and turban into their midst. Obed, much to the amusement of all,
                     began to dance for joy; and the juggler commenced a witty speech, now and then
                     springing into the air, and performing many wonderful feats, which were truly
                     astonishing in their nature. Shouts and cheers from the multitude gave new
                     courage and zeal to the performers; and, in the midst of the excitement,
                     Hasupha quietly withdrew.</p>
                  <p>He retired into a mosque, and knelt in prayer for a long time, pouring out his
                     sorrows before his God and the Prophet, and earnestly beseeching their
                     assistance in this hour of trial. Then he went forth again into the streets of
                     the city, seeking only at that time to speak words of consolation to the
                     mourning and afflicted.</p>
                  <p>In this humble way much good was accomplished; and, by his wisdom, which seemed
                     to increase wonderfully, many errors were corrected, wickedness rebuked,
                     justice administered, sufferings alleviated, and happiness conferred. He heard
                     his own name spoken with admiration on every side; and the story of his faith
                     and sacrifice was repeated from lip to lip. Some of the wealthy prayed that
                     Allah might call upon them to follow his example; and the poor rejoiced that
                     one so good and wise did not feel it beneath him to come down and dwell in
                     their midst.</p>
                  <p>Yet, after all, so sudden had been the change, that it was a hard service. No
                     home, no wives, no food or shelter. Bread and water were cheerfully given to
                     him when he asked for it; yet, nevertheless, Hasupha was a beggar, and, when
                     the wonder at his goodness should pass away, as such he would be treated.
                     Besides, he was mortal; and, as the sun grew hot, his limbs grew weary, and his
                     heart was heavy within him.<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6310-00000061"/> But
                     still he persevered. At length, the cool and silent night came; and he went out
                     of the city, and sat down in the same place where he had seen the beggar the
                     night before. He pillowed his weary head upon a stone, and looked up to the
                     glorious company of the stars, that shone so beautifully above.</p>
                  <p>"O thou great Light of the universe!" he exclaimed: "behold thy servant! Lo, I
                     have no other will but thine. Lead me like a little child."</p>
                  <p>A beautiful Peri, from the bowers of Paradise, seemed to watch over him, and
                     fan him with her wings. She kissed his parched lips and drooping eyelids, and
                     he fell into a sweet sleep.</p>
                  <p>He slept thus some time, when he was aroused by the sound of voices; and,
                     starting up, he beheld himself surrounded by men in rich apparel, with torches
                     in their hands.</p>
                  <p>"Hasupha," said the foremost, "is it thou?"</p>
                  <p>So confused and lost was he, upon being thus suddenly awakened, that he could
                     scarce reply.</p>
                  <p>"Hasupha," continued the person who had first addressed him, "the caliph, our
                     lord, has sent us to seek thee. He hath heard of thy faithfulness, and desires
                     to reward thee. Allow us to conduct thee unto him, and he will bestow upon thee
                     riches and honor according to thy merits."</p>
                  <p>"Nay, nay," said Hasupha. "Let the work which the Prophet hath begun with me be
                     completed. Not from man, but from Allah, shall I receive my reward. Go thou,
                     and tell thy noble master that Hasupha the beggar seeks for those everlasting
                     riches which shall purchase for him a joy that princes never knew."</p>
                  <p>The whole company knelt before him, awed by his words and the majesty of his
                     countenance.</p>
                  <p>"Return," he said, "and bear my answer with you. Here will I await the bidding
                     of Him who alone is my master."</p>
                  <p>They arose and went their way; while Hasupha seated himself upon the ground,
                     and soon fell asleep.</p>
                  <p>About midnight, a hand was laid upon his shoulder, and some one called him by
                     name. He looked up; and what was his astonishment to behold Rabbi Ben Khorat,
                     the greatest scholar and astrologer in all Mecca! For more than thirty years
                     had that grayhaired old man passed sleepless nights in contemplating the starry
                     heavens, and studying their mysterious lore. All men did him reverence, and
                     trembled in his presence; for they knew he never came forth from his lonely
                     tower, save to make known some revelation of the Almighty will.</p>
                  <p>"Hasupha," said the sage, "rise up and follow me; for the stars have spoken,
                     and the command of the Prophet is laid both upon me and thee."</p>
                  <p>"Then will I obey," said Hasupha joyfully.</p>
                  <p>He rose up, and followed Ben Khorat through the lonely streets of the city,
                     till they came to his tower, where they entered, and passed to a spacious
                     chamber, richly furnished, and lighted by many perfumed lamps.</p>
                  <p>"Sit thee down, Hasupha," said the old man, "and let thy heart be at rest
                     within thee; for I bring thee good tidings."</p>
                  <p>He clapped his hands; and a woman, closely veiled, entered the apartment,
                     bearing a basin of water, with which she knelt and washed the feet of
                        Hasupha.<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6310-00000062"/> She then brought him
                     wine and delicious fruits, of which she urged him to partake.</p>
                  <p>As soon as he had refreshed himself, Ben Khorat addressed him.</p>
                  <p>"Hasupha,"said he, "as I watched the stars at midnight, I saw the gleaming of
                     wings and radiant eyes along the sky; and I heard the sound of voices
                     rejoicing, and saying, 'Blessed be Allah! for his name has been glorified in
                     the earth, and the servant whom he hath chosen is worthy of his reward!' I knew
                     not what it meant; but, in the midst of a glorious light, the Prophet appeared
                     to me, and told the story of thy faithfulness. 'Go, now,' said he, 'without the
                     gates of the city, and bring him in hither, and do as I command thee.' Then,
                     when he had instructed me, he departed; and straightway I sought thee. Now,
                     Hasupha, I will teach thee now Allah rewards the faithful; and whatever one
                     loses for his sake, shall be restored to him four-fold. Zuelma, come
                     hither."</p>
                  <p>Again the woman who had washed his feet made her appearance. Ben Khorat removed
                     her veil, and revealed to the astonished merchant the most perfect and lovely
                     countenance he had ever beheld. Every feature of this matchless being was so
                     pure and faultless, that she seemed more like some beautiful vision than a
                     living mortal; and, as she turned her large, dark eyes full upon him, there was
                     such tenderness, such pure affection, in their beamy gaze, that he could not
                     restrain his admiration.</p>
                  <p>"Praised be Allah!" he exclaimed, "that he hath made aught so beautiful!
                     Maiden, who art thou?"</p>
                  <p>"Hasupha," said Ben Khorat, "this is Zuelma, the daughter of Sheik Ali, my
                     younger brother, who was slain in battle. Since her childhood she hath been
                     under my care; and I have instructed her in all those things which are the true
                     glory and charm of womanhood. Her mind is stored with knowledge, and rich with
                     the wisdom of sages; but what is of greater worth to thee, is the deep fountain
                     of affection in her faithful heart, whose sweet waters will not fail in the
                     hours of affliction; and, above all this, reigning supremely in her nature, is
                     a steadfast faith and calm reliance upon the goodness of Him who created her.
                     She hath a head that thinks, a heart that loves, and hands that labor; cheerful
                     in poverty, patient in adversity, and humble in prosperity. Thus have I
                     carefully instructed her, and resolved in my heart to bestow her only upon him
                     for whom Allah had intended her, trusting that he would make it known in due
                     time. According to the commands of the Prophet, I now give her unto thee for
                     thy wife; and may the blessing of Him who loves and rewards the faithful rest
                     upon you both. With her, also, thou shalt inherit the wealth of her father,
                     which greatly exceeds thy former possessions. But not in that shalt thou find
                     thy joy; for the chief happiness of life is love."</p>
                  <p>"O righteous Allah!" exclaimed Hasupha; "thy servant is unworthy of so rich a
                     gift. Yet will I not avail myself of it, unless I find favor with this
                     beautiful maiden; for, if love be not a free gift, it is bitterness and sorrow
                     to the heart."</p>
                  <p>"Let the will of Allah be done!" replied Zuelma. Weeping blissful tears, she
                     fell at his feet, and kissed them; and Hasupha rejoiced, for he knew that in
                     heart and in faith they were one.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <p>ALLAH, the All-wise, never leaves his work half completed. He orders the events
                     aright, like a well-written tale; and the heart of man can not fail to
                     understand the moral.</p>
                  <p>Not long after Hasupha left the market-place that day, Kufan, accompanied by
                     many of his old associates, went to take possession of his treasures.</p>
                  <p>"Ho, now, Kufan!" said one: "thou art so rich, and I so poor, what will it harm
                     thee if thou givest me somewhat to supply my need?"</p>
                  <p>"Hear <emph>me,</emph> Kufan!" called out another. "Didst thou not say, that,
                     if thou wast rich, thou wouldst remember all beggars? and am I not one of the
                     most miserable?"</p>
                  <p>Upon this, they all began to cry out at once, pulling him this way and that;
                     and, finally, in spite of his resistance, they fell upon his merchandise.
                     Seeing that all was about to be lost, he seized one small bag of gold, and,
                     hurrying as fast as possible from the city, he hid himself in the
                     wilderness.</p>
                  <p>"Miserable man that I am!" he exclaimed, as he threw himself upon the ground,
                     and pillowed his head on his gold. "What is to become of me? Will not the
                     villains seek me out, and murder me for what I now have? Here, with a plenty of
                     money, I am starving for bread! I dare not show my face; neither can I beg any
                     more, for every one believes me to be a rich man. O merciful Allah! Take back
                     the accursed gold! Give me once more my old sack and turban, and my beggar's
                     life, and I will be content!"</p>
                  <p>But, while Kufan was thus perplexed, Obed had pursued a different course. He
                     gathered his servants about him; and after taking possession of his gold, and
                     the superb Arabian seed he had so earnestly coveted, he purchased a splendid
                     dwelling in the midst of the city. He had just comfortably established himself,
                     when a brother cobbler appeared before him, bowing very obsequiously.</p>
                  <p>"Obed, Effendi," said he, "may I not be the only one who shall have the honor
                     of making thy sandals hereafter?"</p>
                  <p>"Not he, but I!" cried another, who followed close after. "I will make them for
                     less money."</p>
                  <p>"And I," said a third, "will make them for nothing, if I may but have the
                     honor!"</p>
                  <p>"Obed," said a fourth, "can I not furnish thee with a turban? I have a most
                     elegant and costly variety."</p>
                  <p>"Here are rich silks, furs, and garments, which you greatly need," said a
                     fifth.</p>
                  <p>"Wines, fruits, and delicious ices," cried the sixth.</p>
                  <p>"Beautiful female slaves from Circassia," called out another.</p>
                  <p>And thus they went on, crowding into the apartment, each one anxious to urge
                     his claims to patronage, and shouting in the ears of the enraged cobbler, till
                     he was almost beside himself.</p>
                  <p>"Begone, every one of you!" he cried out in a violent passion. But not one
                     would make way for the other, "Then I will take a sure way to be rid of you.
                     Selim, bring my horse!"</p>
                  <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6310-00000064"/>
                  <p>The horse was brought; and, after a great deal of difficulty, the poor
                     misshapen cobbler was mounted upon his back; but so awkward and ludicrous was
                     his appearance, that the crowd shouted and laughed, and the children hooted
                     after him with all their might. Snorting and rearing, away dashed the
                     high-spirited animal, at a furious speed, through the streets of the city,
                     unrestrained by the feeble hand of the terrified cobbler. He clung to the mane
                     with the tenacity of despair, calling upon Allah and man for help. But his
                     prayers were in vain; and his last hope departed as his steed rushed through
                     the city gate, and sped far away toward the desert.</p>
                  <p>"O Allah!" exclaimed Obed: "spare me this once, and I will never murmur against
                     thy providence again! My poor old legs, miserable as they are, never served me
                     thus! Alas! that we should ever pray for gifts which prove our ruin!"</p>
                  <p>Thus saying, he relaxed his hold, and fell upon the sand; while the proud
                     beast, with a farewell snort, rearing and plunging, disappeared in a cloud of
                     dust.</p>
                  <p>While Obed is left to mourn over his misfortunes, we will return to Wong Chong,
                     who had established himself in the merchant's house. He made preparations for a
                     great feast, to which he invited all the jugglers, magicians, harlequins,
                     dancers, and public performers of the city. The three women, who had concealed
                     themselves in an upper chamber, were dragged forth to entertain the company.
                     Adra sung till she could scarce speak; Kaphira danced till she fell down with
                     weariness; and the beautiful Urad was compelled to wait upon the guests at
                     table. They all ate and drank, and grew very rude and noisy; till at last, when
                     the wine began to have its effect, they fell to beating and almost murdering
                     one another. A few made their escape, and ran for the cadi and his officers.
                     They soon made their appearance, when it was discovered that the house was in
                     flames. The alarm and confusion spread throughout the city; and, as soon as it
                     reached the ears of Hesupha, he hastened to the spot.</p>
                  <p>"Is there any one within?" he cried.</p>
                  <p>A piercing shriek was heard, and he sprang into the flames. Hurrying from room
                     to room, he soon found the three women clinging together, almost dead with
                     fear. He caught the first in his arms, and, drawing the others after him, he
                     brought them out safely to the multitude. But Wong Chong was nowhere to be
                     found; and, when the house was reduced to ashes, it was very evident that he
                     had perished in the flames. In the midst of the people the three women fell
                     down at the feet of Hasupha; and, with prayers and vows of fidelity, they
                     besought him to receive them again to his favor.</p>
                  <p>"Nay, nay," he said mildly: "they who forsake their friends in adversity can
                     not expect to share their confidence in prosperity. I, indeed, pity you, and
                     you shall never want for comforts in this life; but they who would receive
                     faith and love must first be faithful and loving themselves. There is no nobler
                     gift in this world than a true heart; and Allah hath already granted unto me so
                     rich a blessing that my soul is satisfied."</p>

                  <p>HORACE GRANBY of Turveyside walked the floor of his study in a "fine frenzy."
                     He was a poet, and an eager aspirant after literary honors. He had resolved to
                     "woo fame and win her as a bride:" therefore, he did not spare pen, ink, or
                     paper, neither his own brains, which were continually kept in a highly excited
                     and irritable state. Despising all the minor springs of Helicon, he made
                     dramatic literature his aim; and already one play from his pen had been
                     presented to the public, which was quite favorably received.</p>
                  <p>Now he was deeply engaged in a tragedy of five acts, entitled, "Lucius
                     Tarquinius." Livy, Gibbon, Goldsmith, and every Roman historian of ancient or
                     modern times, had been called to his assistance; and he had spent many weary
                     days and nights studying over their pages, to collect materials for this
                     important work.</p>
                  <p>Every one who possesses that peculiar gift, knows very well that a poet
                     exercises a sort of psychological and clairvoyant power, by which he himself
                     becomes the person of whom he writes, and for the time is surrounded by the
                     scenes which his pen describes. Accordingly, the little library at Turveyside
                     was a spacious chamber in a lordly dwelling at Rome, and Horace Granby was
                     Lucius Tarquinius, striding hither and thither like a caged lion, and pouring
                     out his indignation to a friend who was supposed to be present, and was
                     impersonated in the grave old arm-chair which sat by the table. He had already
                     given a history of his wrongs, in being deprived of the throne by the usurper
                     Sextus Tullius, to which was added the injustice of a union with a woman whose
                     timidity and general mildness of character so little accorded with his own,
                     while to his brother was given the proud and beautiful Tullia, whose charms had
                     captivated the heart of Lucius. He was now about to give a glowing recital of
                     his love and passion; but the inspiration failed him. In vain did the poet
                     thrust his fingers through his hair, and invoke all spirits of dramatists, from
                     the olden time to the present day, beginning at the ancient Greek tragedians,
                     and coming down to the immortal Shakspeare. There was a most unaccountable
                     obstruction of ideas. He put his hand to his imaginary sword, he folded his
                     arms in a majestic attitude, and gazed up to the vaulted roof. At length his
                     eye brightened, he spread out his hands toward the arm-chair, and commenced:— <q>
                        <lg type="para">

                           <l>With hand upraised, she seemed to call down fire</l>

                  <p>"Can't I come in?" and the benevolent face of Mrs. Morrill, the housekeeper at
                     Turveyside, appeared at the open door. The good lady put her gold-bowed
                     spectacles upon her forehead, and glanced round the room with a look of
                     surprise. "Why, where is he?" said she.</p>
                  <p>"Who?" said Horace, returning quickly to himself, and looking very much vexed
                     at this interruption.</p>
                  <p>"Why, that man you was talking to."</p>
                  <p>"There's no one here. Come in."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, here's a couple of letters for you, which Freddy has just brought
                     from the post-office." She put them upon the table, and departed as quietly as
                     she came.</p>
                  <p>"Poor fellow!" said she, as she went down stairs. "'Much learning will make him
                     mad.' It seems a mighty fine thing to write poetry, till you find out how it is
                     done. Freddy, put away your book, and go down to the meadow and rake the
                     hay."</p>
                  <p>With a quick and nervous movement, Horace caught up one of the letters, and,
                     tearing open the envelope, read the contents, which ran thus:—</p>

                                 There's a continual cry for <emph>something new,</emph> and we have
                                 promised it. Crowd in as much love, mystery, and murder as
                                 possible. Tempests, robbers, madmen, battles, midnight assassins,
                                 and a few ghosts, are indispensable by way of effect. If you
                                 indulge in any high-toned moral reflections, let them be short and
                                 pithy. As a general thing, such speeches don't take with the crowd,
                                 unless they come from Shakspeare. It's action we want,
                                    <emph>action!</emph> something to gratify excitable human
                                 nature: you understand. Your 'Field of Waterloo' has produced quite
                                 a sensation. The only objection is, that some of the ladies were
                                 almost suffocated by the smoke of gunpowder. This can not be urged
                                 against your next play; so work away, my dear fellow, and send it
                                 up as soon as possible. In haste,</p>

                  <p>"It must, it <emph>shall</emph> be finished!" exclaimed Horace with great
                     enthusiasm. "But, alas! my dear Herric," he continued,—and he brushed up his
                     hair from his forehead, and looked very dignified,—"how little do you<pb
                        n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6310-00000067"/> understand the nature of true genius
                     when it attempts such lofty themes as these! Moving amid the men and scenes of
                     other times, I am transformed. The Roman blood burns in my veins, and Roman
                     speech is on my lips."</p>
                  <p>He drew down his vest, adjusted his cravat, and walked to the mirror. But,
                     alas! he could not see with Roman eyes. After all, there stood Horace Granby,
                     quite an ordinary-looking little man, of a very nervous temperament, which had
                     been so overtaxed in his aspirations after fame that he had grown pale and
                     thin, and bore evident traces in his countenance of a restless and irritable
                     spirit within, which such a physical state usually induces.</p>
                  <p>"It is sad," said he; "but one of our own poets tells us that <q>
                        <lg type="para">

                     </q> Comforting himself with this idea, he returned to his half-written
                     manuscript, and was about to continue his labor, when his eye fell upon the
                     other letter. He opened it, and read as follows:—</p>

                              <p>"Look out! for I mean to make a descent upon you like a comet from
                                 the skies. I am just out of school: Madam Brisson's awful eyes are
                                 no longer upon me. I can hardly contain myself for joy, and do not
                                 expect to do any thing rational again for six weeks. I hate books,
                                 and have a perfect horror of all intellectual people, unless they
                                 have some redeeming quality in their nature to make up for it. I
                                 have pressed Effie Clarendon into my service, and we are both
                                 coming to spend two or three weeks with you. Prepare to have
                                 Turveyside turned topsy-turvy, and every thing in the shape of
                                 literature committed to the flames.</p>

                                 ever. I am not too old for it, and I hope you are not. So make up
                                 your mind for a <emph>great time.</emph> Get a new pair of boots
                                 and a broad-brimmed hat, and prepare for the reception of the

                  <p>It would be impossible to describe the look of mingled vexation and concern
                     depicted in the face of the young poet, as he read this most unwelcome
                     epistle.</p>
                  <p>"Jupiter!" he exclaimed: "what am I to do? Mabel Somers is true to her word,
                     and nothing is left right-side-up where she is. A handsome, but a rude and
                     mischievous girl. Effie Clarendon does very well; but then there is a time for
                     every thing, and <emph>now</emph> is the time to <emph>write.</emph> What!
                     shall I renounce the prize when it is just within my grasp, and forsake the
                     mighty spirits of the past, to dance attendance to two giddy females three
                     weeks in the month of July? Never! And yet what shall I do? Let's see.
                     'Thursday eve.' Heavens! where has this letter been? This very night! Mrs.
                     Morrill!"</p>
                  <p>"What say?"</p>
                  <p>"Two ladies will arrive here to-night, who will stay three weeks."</p>
                  <p>"Mercy on us, Mr. Horace! Why, I shall have to go right to cooking! I want some
                     money to buy sugar and eggs; and, besides, there isn't a stick of wood sawed.
                     Freddy has gone down to the meadow to rake<pb n="134-135"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000068"/> hay, and John isn't able to do the least thing.
                     If you <emph>can,</emph> you must come down and do it yourself, Mr.
                     Horace!"</p>
                  <p>"This is only the beginning of trouble; but I <emph>can</emph> do it, and I
                     will," said Horace, with a look of Roman firmness.</p>
                  <p>He hurried back to his study, scribbled down his last ideas, lest he should
                     lose them, and in a few minutes after was sawing wood in the old shed with all
                     his might.</p>
                  <p>"It is very true," he philosophized, as he stopped and wiped the perspiration
                     from his brow: "there is but a step from the sublime to the ridiculous. At one
                     moment I am a fiery old Roman, and the next a wood-sawyer. I wonder who I
                     should be if. I was myself?"</p>
                  <p>That half-hour's exercise was highly beneficial to Mr. Granby. He ate his
                     dinner with a better appetite, and scribbled away all the afternoon to his
                     heart's content, wholly absorbed in his great work. He was finally aroused by
                     Mrs. Morrill crying out to him,—</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Granby, make haste! the coach is coming!"</p>
                  <p>He seized his coat and hat, and ran down stairs. "Mrs. Morrill," said he, "if
                     they ask for me, tell them I am gone away, and you don't know when I shall be
                     back!"</p>
                  <p>"Bless me, Mr. Horace! do you think I'll tell a lie?"</p>
                  <p>"It is the truth. I <emph>am</emph> going, and I don't know as I shall be back
                     for three weeks."</p>
                  <p>"But what shall I do with them all that time?"</p>
                  <p>"Do the best you can. There is one thing you may be sure of, however: they will
                     not stay more than one night." Thus saying, he darted out of the back door,
                     just as the coach stopped at the front.</p>
                  <p>The great hall-door was thrown open, and a very handsome young lady, richly
                     dressed, made her appearance; and, throwing her arms round Mrs. Morrill's neck,
                     almost suffocated her with kisses.</p>
                  <p>"I declare," said she, in a lively and pleasant tone, "I am delighted to see
                     you once more! though I am so tired I can hardly speak. We have been almost
                     jounced to death in that old coach! Effie, dear, come in, and let the old
                     fellow tumble down the boxes just as he pleases. I don't care for any thing,
                     now I am here!"</p>
                  <p>She followed Mrs. Morrill into the parlor, and taking off her bonnet, which was
                     bent into every possible shape, she threw it upon the floor, and brushed back
                     her hair from her forehead.</p>
                  <p>"Why, where's Cousin Horace?" said she.</p>
                  <p>"Well," replied Mrs. Morrill, looking very much confused, "he has gone away,
                     and I don't know when he will be back."</p>
                  <p>"O the wretch!" exclaimed Mabel. "Did you ever hear the like of that, Effie? I
                     don't believe but that he went off expressly to get clear of us! I'll stay till
                     he comes back, if it's six years! Effie, don't you remember what Herric said
                     about his writing plays? Now, if I once find out he is a literary character,
                     I'll burn every book in the house, and cut his acquaintance for ever! Come,
                     follow me!"</p>
                  <p>But Effie sat by the window, fanning herself with her hat, and looked very much
                     fatigued.</p>
                  <p>"No, indeed," said she: "I can not begin the chase<pb n="136-137"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000069"/> yet. Go on with your discoveries, and I will
                     help you in the destruction."</p>
                  <p>Away went Mabel up the stairs; and, after running through several vacant rooms,
                     she came into the library. There lay the pen upon the table, with the ink yet
                     undried. She took it up and looked at it. Her cheeks crimsoned, and the tears
                     stood in her eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Cousin Horace," said she, "I have known the time when you would not have
                     treated me thus for all the world! Either you or I have changed. Yes,
                        <emph>I</emph> have, I know; and why not <emph>you?</emph> I ought to have
                     expected it. It's three years since we played together; and now I am a woman,
                     and you are a man. But, fiddlestick! who cares?"</p>
                  <p>She threw down the pen, and was about leaving the room, when her eye fell upon
                     the unfinished manuscript.</p>
                  <p>"Hey, ho! What's this? 'Lucius Tarquinius.' As I live, the very play Herric
                     spoke of! Twenty-five written pages, and not done yet! Mr. Horace Granby of
                     Turveyside, it's my opinion that you left in such haste you forgot your chief
                     treasure. Now, <emph>I</emph> am not a sufficient attraction to bring you back;
                     but <emph>here's</emph> the loadstone, the magnet which will do it; and, for
                     safe keeping, I'll just put it in my pocket!" And this she did, with a look of
                     most mischievous satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>That was quite enough for the time; and she ran down stairs in fine
                     spirits.</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Effie, "what did you find?"</p>
                  <p>"Find, Effie! I have found something worth more than Aladdin's wonderful lamp.
                     It is a magician's wand, with which I will work wonders."</p>
                  <p>"O Mab! call up a house full of witches then! This is just the place for them.
                     This house always seemed to me like an old castle. So large and roomy, with
                     such dark passage-ways and winding staircases! There never was a place that had
                     a better right to being haunted."</p>
                  <p>"I wish it was, Effie, with all my heart! What a time we should have! I would
                     sit up all night to chase ghosts. Now, while I think of it, Mrs. Morrill, I
                     want to ask a favor of you. We want to sleep up in the very top of this old
                     ark, where we can see the sun rise in the morning. That is something which I
                     have not witnessed for many a year; and it would seem almost as good as seeing
                     the face of an old friend."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I can easily accommodate you, if you wish it, and are not afraid."</p>
                  <p>"Afraid! Mrs. Morrill, I should like you would show me something I <emph>am
                        afraid of!</emph>"</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>AFTER making such a hasty retreat, Horace pursued his way directly to the
                     village, where he agreed with an excellent old lady, Mrs. Bartol, that she
                     should furnish him lodgings for an indefinite length of time. He had resolved,
                     by some artifice, to rid the house of the unwelcome guests as soon as possible.
                     But, if this could not be effected, he should finish his play in retirement,
                     and then make his appearance, as if he had just<pb n="138-139"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000070"/> returned from a journey. He found Mrs. Bartol's
                     parlor-chamber an excellent place for meditation; and was just about seating
                     himself to his labors, when, thrusting his hand into his pocket for his
                     manuscript, where he had intended to put it, he found it was missing. In a
                     moment, his cousin's mischievous and destructive propensities came to his mind,
                     and he trembled for its safety.</p>
                  <p>"Very well," said he: "she will not be likely to find it to-night, and then I
                     shall secure it myself."</p>
                  <p>Just after dusk, he stole slyly up among the vines and shrubbery, to
                     reconnoiter the premises. He heard the sound of music; and, entering the house,
                     he stood behind the parlor-door, peeping, in a very <emph>un-Roman-</emph>like
                     manner, through the crack. There sat Mabel at the piano, with her face glowing
                     with animation, singing a merry song in a clear, ringing voice, while Effie
                     accompanied her in the alto. Mrs. Morrill, and John her goodman, were listening
                     intently; and Freddy sat with open mouth and eyes, as if under a spell of
                     enchantment. Take it all in all, Horace Granby thought it was a charming
                     picture. He was all that even Shakspeare could have wished, in the way of
                     music; for he was an excellent singer, and was easily "moved by concord of
                     sweet sounds;" and now the temptation was very great to go in and join in their
                     songs. But the laurels of his fame were too fresh to be thus lightly renounced.
                     Lucius Tarquinius seemed to whisper with a chiding voice in his ear; and, with
                     stoical coolness, he turned away.</p>
                  <p>It was not long before Mabel and her friend, overcome by the fatigues of their
                     journey, begged to retire. Mabel led the way, with a little flickering light in
                     her hand, chatting merrily to Effie, who followed close behind. They had
                     ascended the second flight of stairs, and were passing on to the third, when,
                     in the long, dim corridor, stood a tall, ghostly figure, directly before
                     them.</p>
                  <p>"O heavens!" shrieked Effie: "what is that?" and she turned, and darted down
                     the stairs; but, quick as thought, Mabel set down her lamp, and sprang toward
                     the apparition. This seemed to be a movement wholly unexpected on the part of
                     the phantom; for it turned about, and ran the other way in great haste, closely
                     pursued by Mabel. The long, flowing drapery seemed greatly to impede its
                     progress; and, considering the light and evanescent nature of such beings,
                     there was a great deal of noise attendant upon its flight, and some stifled
                     laughter. A mighty effort was made to unloose the drapery from under the chin;
                     but the head of the pin was securely hidden, and Mrs. Bartol's sheets were made
                     of very firm cloth.</p>
                  <p>On they went, up stairs and down, with a tremendous racket; through empty
                     chambers and old storerooms filled with looms and spinning-wheels, and all
                     sorts of household lumber; out into the long, dark passage-ways, and down
                     winding staircases, where any careful persons would surely have broken their
                     necks. At length they reached the basement; and the ghost disappeared in a
                     little dark room, which, to Mabel, appeared to have no visible point of egress.
                     Not a ray of the moonlight which shone into the other rooms penetrated the
                     gloom of this. She listened, but heard no sound; and, pulling to the door, she
                     thrust a stick<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6310-00000071"/> through the latch,
                     which, for that purpose, was very conveniently constructed.</p>
                  <p>"Lucius Tarquinius," cried she, as she rapped upon the door, "is that you? If
                     so, then speak, for you I have offended. I pause for a reply."</p>
                  <p>But no reply was given. She began to repeat passages from the play; and, after
                     completely exhausting her whole stock of raillery without provoking an answer,
                     she turned away. But she did not go directly to her chamber. The excitement had
                     passed, and now came the revulsion. She seated herself upon a stool by the open
                     window; and, leaning her head on her hands, she burst into tears, sobbing
                     aloud.</p>
                  <p>Close among the vines under the window stood the mock ghost, who had thrown
                     aside his drapery, and escaped by a small door into the garden. Those sobs
                     smote upon his ear, and sank down into the deep places of his heart. Just then
                     he wished Lucius Tarquinius was at the bottom of the Dead Sea, and every
                     playhouse in London burned to ashes. All the better feelings of his really
                     generous nature were aroused, and he began to wonder what evil spirit had
                     possessed him. Old memories of his boyhood came thronging back upon him, when
                     he fished with little Cousin Mab in the brook, or roved with her through fields
                     and woods in search of berries. Her merry eyes and rosy cheeks were fresh and
                     beautiful as ever, and her light laugh rung in his ears. He looked up to the
                     window to speak to her; he raised his hand: but she was gone, and nothing save
                     a little embroidered handkerchief greeted his touch. He took it: it was wet
                     with her tears. By an involuntary impulse, he pressed it to his own eyes,
                     whence, unmanly though it may seem, a few truant drops had stolen, called up by
                     the blessed memories of his childhood.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <p>THE next morning, nothing could be talked of but the wonderful appearance of
                     the ghost, and Mabel's courage. Mrs. Morrill, however, was very silent on the
                     subject; which led Effie to think that she knew more about the affair than she
                     was willing to tell: which was very true.</p>
                  <p>The merry girls spent the earlier part of the day in rambling about the
                     grounds, helping the men make hay, weeding the flower-beds with John, and
                     treating Freddy to rides in the gardener's wheelbarrow. Mrs. Morrill was
                     delighted; and she could not help thinking that Horace had denied himself a
                     great pleasure in thus forsaking the society of such agreeable ladies.</p>
                  <p>After dinner, Mabel proposed a walk to the village; and without bonnets, or any
                     shelter from the sun save their open parasols, they set out. As they were about
                     crossing the bridge over the little brook, Mabel spied a juvenile fisherman
                     among the bushes which bordered the stream.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my!" she exclaimed: "I used to catch fish here once myself. Look here,
                     little boy: pray do let me try one moment."</p>
                  <p>The boy readily yielded his rod into her hands; and,<pb n="142-143"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000072"/> throwing down her parasol upon the bank, she was
                     wholly absorbed in her employment. It was not long before she threw up a fine
                     fish.</p>
                  <p>"There!" said she, looking as happy as a child: "now I am satisfied. I declare,
                     it seems just like old times. How many fish have you got, little boy?" She
                     peeped into his basket. "Six! Why, really, you have done pretty well."</p>
                  <p>She secretly dropped a piece of silver into the basket, and turned about for
                     her parasol, when she perceived it floating gayly down the brook. Away she
                     started after it; but before she reached it, a young man stepped from the
                     bushes and recovered it. As he advanced to meet her, she scrutinized him
                     closely. He was very prepossessing in his appearance. His dress, his
                     complexion, his curling mustache, his dark hair and eyes, all seemed to mark
                     him as of foreign origin. Presenting the parasol, he addressed her in poor
                     English, and still worse Italian; at the same time his eye accidentally fell
                     upon the stolen manuscript which was peeping from her pocket. A glance of
                     recognition was all that betrayed the discovery. But Mabel observed it. She
                     could not restrain a mischievous smile; and, thanking him in pure Italian, she
                     turned quickly away.</p>
                  <p>"Does he think," said she, "that I have grown so old I have lost my eyesight,
                     and my memory has failed me? No! I should know him, if he were disguised as a
                     Hottentot."</p>
                  <p>"O Mabel!" exclaimed Effie, as she came up with her: "isn't that an adventure?
                     I think I see it now, written in your journal, 'Lost my parasol in the brook,
                     which was recovered, at the imminent risk of life, by a handsome young
                     foreigner, who was doubtless a prince in disguise.' I shall expect to hear a
                     guitar under the window to-night."</p>
                  <p>"Fie, Effie! He may be in disguise; but as to his being a prince, or even a
                     foreigner, I don't believe it."</p>
                  <p>The tinkling of a little bell attracted their attention; and out from a low
                     wooden building rushed a whole troop of flaxen-headed urchins and bright-eyed
                     girls. Some began to fly their kites, some to drive hoop, and others to play
                     ball.</p>
                  <p>The stranger was instantly forgotten; and, in a moment, the happy girls were in
                     the midst of the astonished children, who had never seen such fine ladies
                     before. With unaffected good-nature they chatted away with one and another, and
                     soon made themselves acquainted. Effie helped one boy raise his kite, while
                     Mabel taught some of the little ones to guide their hoops. Finally, they
                     borrowed a ball, and began to play in good earnest themselves.</p>
                  <p>"What would Madam Brisson say, if she could see us now? Don't you feel ashamed
                     of yourself?" said Effie.</p>
                  <p>"Ashamed! no," said Mabel. "It seems delightful to be free from all restraint,
                     and act myself once more."</p>
                  <p>"Well, but you would stop in an instant, if you knew what I do."</p>
                  <p>"Pray, what is it, Effie?"</p>
                  <p>"Just this: that away on the left there, under the old apple-tree, stands the
                     very person who saved your parasol, watching us very intently."</p>
                  <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6310-00000073"/>
                  <p>"Well, I don't care," said Mabel: "let him look till he is tired!"</p>
                  <p>But in a few moments she complained that the sun burned her face; and, taking
                     up their parasols once more, they bade the children "good-by," and sauntered
                     off through the wood. They came out at last upon the main road that ran through
                     the village. Near by stood a large, old-fashioned farm-house, very inviting in
                     appearance, on one side of which was an extensive inclosure, well stocked with
                     all kinds of domestic fowls and animals. Hens, chickens, ducks, geese, and
                     turkeys, all seemed to mingle in friendly companionship. Several cows, just
                     returned from pasture, were standing on one side, waiting to be milked. An old
                     horse, that had been hard at work all day, seemed to have fallen fast asleep
                     over the pail of water that stood before him; and a number of fine-looking pigs
                     were walking lazily about, or rooting in the dirt.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, just look!" exclaimed Mabel: "isn't this equal to the zoölogical gardens?
                     Let's go in."</p>
                  <p>She pushed open the great gate; and in they both went, to the great
                     consternation of the fowls, who ran screaming and cackling one way and another,
                     making a great ado. In the midst of the confusion, out rushed a big dog from
                     his kennel, and set up a furious barking. The girls were terrified; and, as he
                     came upon them with open mouth, they ran screaming in at the door of the
                     farm-house.</p>
                  <p>"Fie, fie, Jowler!" called out a very pleasant looking old lady, who
                     immediately made her appearance: "go back into your kennel, and behave
                     yourself."</p>
                  <p>The dog went sneaking back again, looking very much ashamed.</p>
                  <p>"Come in, dear ladies," she added: "you look both hot and tired. Just sit down
                     and rest yourselves a bit, and I will bring you some nice milk."</p>
                  <p>They were very glad to avail themselves of her kind invitation. She drew out
                     some chairs in a cool place in the nice little kitchen; and, after bringing
                     them a good supply of cakes and milk, she went back to her spinning.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! did you ever see the like?" cried out Effie, at the first buzz of the
                     wheel. "Isn't that strange?"</p>
                  <p>Both girls started up, and stood beside the old woman as she spun. She seemed
                     to be very much pleased at their taking so great an interest in her labor, and
                     talked away very sociably.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" said Mabel, "Mrs.—what's your name?"</p>
                  <p>"Bartol."</p>
                  <p>"Pray, do let me try to spin!"</p>
                  <p>The good lady told her how to hold the thread and turn the wheel, and in a
                     short time she became very expert at the business. Then she taught Effie; and
                     first one would spin, and then the other. So much interested did they become in
                     this novel employment, that every thing else was forgotten, and the time passed
                     by unheeded.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, good Mrs. Bartol had busied herself in spreading her tea-table in
                     the front parlor; and, when all was ready, she begged them to sit down and take
                     tea with her.</p>
                  <p>"I am very sorry," said she, "that the gentleman above stairs will not come
                     down and join our party.<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6310-00000074"/> I told him,
                     in a joking way, that there were two very pretty ladies here; but he still
                     insisted upon having his supper brought up."</p>
                  <p>"What is the matter with him?" said Mabel. "Is he sick?"</p>
                  <p>"No. He is writing poetry, I believe."</p>
                  <p>Mabel elevated her hands and eyes in such a comical manner, that Effie burst
                     into a laugh.</p>
                  <p>"He might as well be dead," she exclaimed. "Poetry is a mighty fine thing in
                     itself; but it is as much a disease of the brain as the pearl is of the oyster.
                     Keep good warm thoughts in the heart, and let them come out at the lips. But
                     if, like weeds that grow in the shade, you let them run up rank and tall into
                     the head, and go to seed there, you may well expect to be crazy."</p>
                  <p>"What a philosopher!" said Effie. "I don't think any ideas will ever go to seed
                     in your brain!"</p>
                  <p>"No: it is not favorable for any such productions. But what is the name of this
                     unfortunate individual, Mrs. Bartol?"</p>
                  <p>"Well," she replied, after some hesitation, "I can't say."</p>
                  <p>"Why not?" said Mabel very inquisitively: "is it because you don't know, or
                     don't mean to tell?"</p>
                  <p>"I guess it's as much that as any thing. To tell the truth, however, he does
                     not wish to be known by any one; and I am sure, had you seen him yesterday, you
                     would not have believed him the same person to-day. He does not look at all
                     like himself."</p>
                  <p>"Who does he look like?"</p>
                  <p>"As much like a foreigner as you can think."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, dear!" exclaimed Effie: "after all, then, our prince in disguise is
                     nothing but a half-crazed poet."</p>
                  <p>"Never mind," said Mrs. Bartol: "there are as many real as make-believe folks
                     in the world. Come, let's take tea." And so they sat down together.</p>
                  <p>Horace Granby sat in his room above. He saw the girls when they entered the
                     farm-yard. He sat for a long time holding his pen and listening to their
                     pleasant voices. The spirit of Lucius Tarquinius failed to impart the least
                     inspiration. Most unconsciously, when they laughed he laughed; and at last,
                     finding all attempt at writing was vain, he threw down his pen, and took this
                     favorable opportunity to steal away and make a visit to Turveyside.</p>
                  <p>"O Mabel! only look!" said Effie, as they rose from the table. "The sun has
                     set, and we have yet a great way to go. Besides, I have on consumption shoes,
                     and the dew must have fallen heavily by this time. Come, let's go."</p>
                  <p>As they went out into the front yard, accompanied by Mrs. Bartol, they saw a
                     load of hay standing in the road.</p>
                  <p>"Where do you suppose that hay is going?" asked Mabel.</p>
                  <p>"Well, I <emph>know,</emph>" said Mrs. Bartol, "that it is going directly past
                     Turveyside."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! well, then," said Effie, "let's wait till the driver comes along, and ask
                     him if we may get on."</p>
                  <p>"What's the use of waiting?" said Mabel. "We can get on now; and, if we cover
                     ourselves up, he will not know he has two passengers till we call upon him to
                     stop."</p>
                  <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6310-00000075"/>
                  <p>That was a famous idea. Without delay they scrambled up to the top of the load;
                     and, with a word of affectionate farewell to Mrs. Bartol, they hid themselves
                     in the fragrant hay.</p>
                  <p>It was not long before the driver came, and away they started.</p>
                  <p>"Isn't this fine?" whispered Mabel. "I had rather ride so, than in a coach with
                     the queen. But we must keep a bright lookout for Turveyside. Lift up your head
                     now and then, Effie, and take an observation."</p>
                  <p>After quite a ride, they arrived opposite the gardengate, and both girls
                     started up.</p>
                  <p>"Stop! please stop!" called out Mabel; but the driver, hearing a strange voice,
                     and not knowing from whence it came, only started his horse the quicker.</p>
                  <p>"Stop! stop!" cried out both at once. But the louder they called, the faster he
                     drove,—away down the hill, and round the road, till he came to a little
                     cottage, where he stopped; and, springing off, rushed into the house without
                     looking behind him.</p>
                  <p>Laughing so they could scarcely speak, the girls sprang from the load, and
                     started for home.</p>
                  <p>"Only think," said Mabel, "what a great way we have to go! It will be dark
                     before we get there, unless we run directly across the meadow." And,
                     accordingly, they went that way.</p>
                  <p>The meadow-ground was very wet and treacherous; and, before they had crossed
                     it, their shoes were completely soaked with water.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my feet are dreadfully wet!" cried out Effie. "I shall catch my
                     death!"</p>
                  <p>"No you won't, either, if you run and keep them warm. Here, give me your
                     hand."</p>
                  <p>All glowing with exercise, and full of animation, at last they reached the
                     garden-gate. It had no sooner closed upon them, when Effie raised her hand,
                     and, with an exclamation of surprise, pointed toward a bush, behind which the
                     young man they had met by the brook was just retreating. He saw that he was
                     discovered, and concealment was useless. Quietly awaiting their approach, he
                     touched his hat, and stammered out a few words of broken English.</p>
                  <p>Much to Effie's surprise, Mabel burst into a merry laugh; and, laying her hand
                     upon his arm, looked him directly in the face.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Clarendon," said she, "shall I present to you Signor Horatio Granby, my
                     cousin?"</p>
                  <p>"Why," exclaimed Effie in perfect astonishment, "so it is! Who would have
                     thought it? Why, Horace Granby! What a trick you have played us! You do not
                     deserve the least mercy at our hands, and need not expect it!"</p>
                  <p>"No, Effie," said Mabel: "just go and cut me a prickly stick out of the hedge
                     yonder, and I will teach him better manners in future."</p>
                  <p>"Not now," said Effie, "while my feet are so wet. I shall run into the house
                     and make myself comfortable, while you bring along the culprit; then we will
                     settle this business at our leisure." Thus saying, she hurried away up the
                     gravel walk.</p>
                  <p>No sooner had she disappeared among the shrubbery, than Mabel turned, with
                     flushed cheeks and quivering lips.</p>
                  <p>"Cousin Horace," said she in a tone of gentle reproach, "how could you treat me
                     thus? Had you<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6310-00000076"/> not wanted us, you
                     might have staid at home, like a man, and said so. As it was, I had determined
                     to stay till you came back, it mattered not how long. Now I will return
                     to-morrow, and I will never trouble you again, though I shall almost cry my
                     eyes out; for I did love you when I was a child, with all my heart. But I
                     suppose we are both too old for that now."</p>
                  <p>Horace threw off his cloak and hat. He tore off his false mustache; and,
                     brushing back his hair from his forehead, as he usually wore it, he looked her
                     kindly in the face.</p>
                  <p>"There, now," he said, "I am myself again; and may God forgive me if I ever try
                     to be any one else! Cousin Mab, I have acted like a fool; but I am sorry for
                     it." And he put his arms about her neck, and kissed her.</p>
                  <p>"I think you have," said she; "and I can not imagine what made you do so."</p>
                  <p>"It was a foolish aspiration after greatness that took possession of my mind,
                     and bent me to its will. It has been burning and starving my soul for these
                     last three years, and wearing away my health and happiness. I have felt
                     convinced of this long enough, but never before had the moral courage to say
                     so. Now I am done; and, God helping me, I will try to be what I am myself, and
                     nothing more. Mab, you will never know me to write poetry again."</p>
                  <p>"O Horace! don't say so," she exclaimed earnestly. "I have said a great many
                     hard and foolish things; but I do admire <emph>good</emph> poetry,—that which
                     any one writes because he can't help it, and for nothing else. If a great and
                     good impulse inspire a man, he ought to let the world know it. The only fault I
                     find is, that people write what they don't feel; and so we have a great
                     quantity of thoughts of a very poor quality. Here, take this, and finish it."
                     And she drew the manuscript from her pocket. "If I am a foolish, thoughtless
                     girl, I know how to admire what is worthy in others."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I <emph>will</emph> finish it," he said, as he took the manuscript; and,
                     quick as thought, he tore it into countless fragments, scattering them to the
                     winds.</p>
                  <p>"Why, Horace Granby! what have you done?" said Mabel, in great
                     astonishment.</p>
                  <p>"I have done my duty," said he; "and now, Mab, I am at your service for three
                     weeks to come, and all my lifetime, if you choose to say so." As he spoke, he
                     fell gracefully upon one knee, and kissed the hand which he held.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, fie! Cousin Horace," stammered Mab. "You have studied theatricals so long,
                     that you act them to perfection."</p>
                  <p>"I am myself now, Mab, and this is no studied part. It is the natural impulse
                     of my heart; and I speak just as you say you would have people
                        write,—<emph>became I can't help it.</emph> Do you accept the service,
                     Mab?"</p>
                  <p>In spite of her efforts, a gush of happy tears came raining over Mab's rosy
                     cheeks. She put her hand in her pocket for her handkerchief, but it was not
                     there; and, because Horace still had it in his possession, he kindly wiped them
                     away for her.</p>
                  <p>What more was said is a profound secret, as it was only overheard by the nest
                     of robins on the wall, and they never told. Effie, however, became quite
                        anxious<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6310-00000077"/> at so long an absence,
                     and went out to seek them. She met them coming up the gravel-walk, arm in arm,
                     looking at the moon; and, as she already had some experience in such matters,
                     she considered it a very suspicious circumstance.</p>

                              <p>"MY DEAR HERRIC" It is my painful duty to inform you that Lucius
                                 Tarquinius is dead. He came to a tragical end, being torn in
                                 pieces, and scattered to the four winds of heaven. There are no
                                 mourners over his untimely fate. As for myself, I have determined
                                 to give up writing plays, and become an actor, for which purpose I
                                 am now taking lessons of Cousin Mab. My first appearance will be in
                                 a play entitled The Happy Wedding,' in which she is to act an
                                 important part. It is to take place one week from to-night. I most
                                 earnestly beseech you to come down and criticise, as it may be a
                                 useful lesson to you. My next character will be that of a 'Country
                                 Gentleman,' in the great 'Drama of Life In this I intend to employ
                                 all my powers of head, hand, and heart, to the best advantage; and,
                                 with the assistance of my teacher, I have no doubt I shall succeed
                                 to the satisfaction of all my friends.</p>

                     his hammer in his hand, and looked down upon the black, slippery rocks, and the
                     foam-covered stream that rushed through the valley below. "Truly, one might
                     take this for the entrance to Tartarus itself; but I have seen enough of the
                     world to know that the richest treasures are not found in the fairest places,
                     and this spot may be the very one that holds the great carbuncle. Come on,

                     She was perched upon a woe-begone-looking donkey, whose long ears seemed the
                     only part of him capable of remaining upright. Besides the woman,—who, from her
                     size, could not be accounted a great burden,—the poor beast bore a large basket
                     on either side, and a leather portmanteau fastened to the saddle.</p>
                  <p>He formed a strange contrast to his rider, who, just now, seemed all spirit and
                     resolution. She sat up very straight, with her lips firmly compressed, as
                     though she had determined that all the world should not move her. Her
                     face—unprotected by the small plaid handkerchief she wore about her head—was
                     burned almost to a blister. She had large, brilliant black eyes, and long, dark
                     hair, which hung in tangled tresses upon her shoulders. Her dress, was short
                     and faded, and her shoes were so worn they scarce served to cover her feet.
                     Although a small, delicate female, her whole appearance bore evidence of
                     hardship and exposure beyond what she was able to bear.</p>
                  <p>"No," she again repeated, in the same decided tone; "not another step will I
                     follow."</p>
                  <p>Norman turned round in astonishment. This was the first time, during an
                     association of several years, that she had ever gainsayed, or in any way
                     opposed him; and therefore he was wholly taken by surprise.</p>
                  <p>"Elsie," said he, in a tone of authority, "come on! I am quite convinced that
                     here I shall find the great carbuncle."</p>
                  <p>"The great carbuncle, forsooth!" she repeated impatiently. "If I were but sure
                     of finding a great potato or a thistle-top for poor Jack, I might follow; but
                     as to going down among these barren rocks, I positively <emph>will not!</emph>"
                     And she gave emphasis to what she said by a decided nod.</p>
                  <p>Here was no common difficulty: a stubborn woman and a donkey, both, to all
                     appearance, determined neither to be coaxed nor driven. Norman had little
                     experience in such matters, but common proverbs had<pb n="156-157"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000079"/> taught him that nothing could exceed the
                     perversity of two such beings.</p>
                  <p>"Elsie, my little wife," he said, in a soothing tone, as he took her small
                     brown hand in his, and patted her scorched cheek, "I pray you, if you love me,
                     come down into the valley. I am quite sure the great carbuncle must lie in some
                     of these black chasms; and it will be a great pity, if, after all my labors, I
                     should come so near and then lose it."</p>
                  <p>"I would rather go and chase butterflies in the fields of dear Lucerne," said
                     Elsie.</p>
                  <p>"And soon you shall, if now you will go with me. Only think, when we get that
                     precious stone, what a fine lady you will be, and how much will be thought of
                     us!"</p>
                  <p>"What is the use," said Elsie, "of one's suffering to death now for the sake of
                     taking comfort by and by? O Norman! all for the love of you, I have been a
                     wretched wanderer these two years, and no good has come of it! You have
                     promised me again and again that each place we visited should be the last; and
                     I believed you, till now my patience is exhausted. I have suffered with hunger,
                     with could and fatigue; and, while I have been almost dying in the mountains or
                     in the forest, you have thought of nothing, talked of nothing, save the great
                     carbuncle."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, but, my dear Elsie! when one seeks a thing, it must be with his whole
                     heart, and the treasure he finds shall be in proportion to his labor. Let the
                     thought of our rich reward, after so much suffering, encourage you; and come
                     down at once into the valley."</p>
                  <p>"No, I <emph>won't,</emph>" said Elsie. "Every night do I dream of my old
                     father and mother, and my home in dear Lucerne. My heart is continually
                     yearning for them; and now back to Lucerne I <emph>will</emph> go. Seek for the
                     great carbuncle as long as you choose; and when you find it, eat it, drink it,
                     marry it, and enjoy it all you can, since you would rather have it than all the
                     world beside."</p>
                  <p>"Jezebel!" exclaimed Norman in a passion, "go thy way! I had thought thee
                     somewhat better than the rest of thy kind; but now I find, that, from old
                     mother Eve downward, all are the same. Yes, go thy way; but remember, when I
                     find the great carbuncle, I will not return to thee.</p>
                  <p>He grasped his hammer desperately, and, raising his bag to his shoulder,
                     started off at a brisk pace down the rocks. Elsie watched him till a jutting
                     point hid him from view, and then her firmness gave way. She bowed her head
                     upon the neck of her tired beast, and wept like a child.</p>
                  <p>"Miserable woman that I am!" she exclaimed. "I can no more leave him than the
                     moon can leave the earth, or the stars the skies. And yet my poor heart is torn
                     out of me with longings for home and a quiet resting-place. Oh that such a
                     thing as geology or the great carbuncle had never been heard of!"</p>
                  <p>The poor donkey bowed his head with a deep sigh, as though he fully understood
                     her last remark. Elsie sprang from his back, and led him up the rocks. Here she
                     left him in the shadow of a tree, while she went in search of something to
                     satisfy the poor creature's appetite. It was not long before she returned
                        with<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6310-00000080"/> the skirt of her dress
                     filled with thistle-tops, and in her hand a large branch filled with ripe
                     berries for herself.</p>
                  <p>"Here, Jack," she said, "God has been very good to us. Many a bloody scratch
                     have these rough thistles given me, but I can do and bear any thing for so true
                     a friend. We are all alone now, Jack."</p>
                  <p>With a gush of tears, she threw the thistles upon the ground; and, clasping her
                     arms about his neck, she kissed him, and laid her cheek against his rough face,
                     with all the affection of a sister. The donkey gave evidence of his sympathy by
                     low sighs and gentle rubs, and then began right earnestly upon his
                     thistles.</p>
                  <p>Poor Elsie had no idea as to the direction of Lucerne, or whether it was five
                     or a thousand miles thence; but she resolved to go on her way, and inquire of
                     every one she met. She found it very difficult, however, to take the first
                     step. The day wore wearily away, and she could not summon resolution to depart.
                     Her little loving heart was drawn as by a magnetic influence after Norman; and
                     she would gladly have gone down into the crater of a volcano, could she have
                     been sure of finding him at the bottom. She was quite certain, that, if he felt
                     as unhappy as she, he would soon return to look for her; and she firmly
                     resolved, that, if he did, he should agree to her terms, and return with her to
                     Lucerne. Jack lay down under a tree to rest; and, for want of better company,
                     she sat down beside him, and laid her head upon his neck, where she soon cried
                     herself asleep.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>MEANWHILE, Norman had pursued his way, feeling wonderfully disturbed in his
                     mind.</p>
                  <p>"Am I not a man and a philosopher?" he exclaimed; "and shall I be governed by
                     the whims of a foolish woman? No, not I. The world, with all her boundless
                     treasures, lies before me. In her bosom are the secrets of ages, which I will
                     bring to light, and thereby render my name immortal. A good wife is, indeed, a
                     great convenience, but there are times when she may also prove a hinderance;
                     and, therefore, he who would be truly wise should never thus encumber himself.
                     Henceforth I leave all womankind to those uncultured minds who care only for
                     the cleanliness of their linen and the pampering of their appetites."</p>
                  <p>He walked on with a stately step, passing several rare specimens of rocks which
                     he had never seen before. At any other time he would have clipped off fragments
                     with his hammer, to add to the large collection which he already carried in his
                     bag; but now the burden on his heart, added to that on his shoulder, was as
                     much as he could bear.</p>
                  <p>"What a rough, toilsome road this is!" he said at last; "and the sun is hot
                     enough to melt one. Truly, I was never more uncomfortable in all my life."</p>
                  <p>He sat himself down upon the rocks; and, while he rested, he poured out the
                     contents of his bag, which he surveyed with the greatest satisfaction. He
                        had<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6310-00000081"/> been at great trouble and
                     expense in collecting these rare specimens of stones and minerals, and
                     therefore he regarded them as his chief treasure. Here might be seen a strange
                     commingling of precious stones with some of nature's rudest materials,—rough
                     granite and slate, with quartz and felspar, gold and silver ores, several
                     specimens of Italian marble, porphyry and alabaster, a ruby, and a diamond in
                     its unpolished state, with many other precious stones.</p>
                  <p>"All but the one I desire most," said Norman with a sigh. "Could I but find
                        <emph>that,</emph> I would make it the key-stone in the arch on which to
                     build my fame. These, alone, will introduce me to the highest scientific
                     circles; but, without that crowning glory, I can not be satisfied. Yes: the
                     great carbuncle I <emph>must</emph> have, for I am fully convinced there is
                     such a stone in the treasury of nature, and I will not rest till I find it; so,
                     fare thee well, Elsie!"</p>
                  <p>He returned his treasures to the bag, tied on the string, and placed it upon
                     the rock beside him. But, unfortunately, the heavy top curved over, the
                     equilibrium was lost, and, according to an immutable law of nature, the bag
                     fell. Norman grasped at it, but it only grazed the tips of his fingers, and
                     then, rolling over and over down the rocks, disappeared in the flood below.
                     Stupefied with amazement, he gazed after it. He might as well have undertaken
                     to gather up a handful of bubbles, as to seek to recover it from that rough,
                     dark stream.</p>
                  <p>"O righteous Heaven!" he exclaimed: "could a worse misfortune have befallen me!
                     Here, take this also, for now I am a ruined man!" And he threw his hammer after
                     it.</p>
                  <p>"Alas! alas!" he added mournfully: "had Elsie been here, this would not have
                     happened: she was always so careful. I see now that no good comes of quarreling
                     with one's wife. O Elsie! my dear little Elsie!"</p>
                  <p>Perfectly reckless as to whither he went, he pursued his way until he came
                     suddenly upon the entrance of a large cave, arched and high, but dark as
                     midnight within. It is in human nature to believe that the way to success lies
                     through deepest mysteries; therefore Norman surveyed this strange opening with
                     peculiar interest.</p>
                  <p>"Who knows," he exclaimed, "but that I may here retrieve my fallen
                     fortune?"</p>
                  <p>He entered without delay, and walked along a dark, winding passage-way. Soon
                     every ray of light from without was lost, and he was bewildered in the
                     darkness. The air was very cold, and the water dropped constantly from above.
                     His prudence got the better of his curiosity, and he turned him about.</p>
                  <p>"I think I will return," he said; "for I shall neither benefit science nor
                     myself by further investigations in this quarter."</p>
                  <p>He walked a long distance, yet did not appear to be any nearer the entrance.
                     Suddenly it occurred to him that perhaps there were several of these passages,
                     and he had taken the wrong direction. Agitated by this thought, he was
                     hastening forward, when, as he thrust out his foot in the darkness, it found no
                     resting-place. A bewildering fear that he was on the brink of some dangerous
                     precipice came over him, and he fell senseless. When he returned to
                     consciousness, an old man<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6310-00000082"/> was
                     kneeling beside him, pouring wine between his parted lips. A lantern and a
                     pickaxe were on the ground beside them.</p>
                  <p>"Where am I?" exclaimed Norman.</p>
                  <p>"In the king's quicksilver mine, in the mountain of La Manche," replied the
                     stranger. "But who are you, and why are you here?"</p>
                  <p>"I am Norman of Lucerne," he answered; "and am in search of the great
                     carbuncle."</p>
                  <p>"The great carbuncle!" groaned the old man. "Alas! and are you also a victim to
                     that delusion?"</p>
                  <p>He raised the lantern to his own face. "Do you see these dim eyes and gray
                     hairs?" he asked. "I am Paulo Benevento. From youth to age I have sought for
                     that fabulous stone, and found it not. It exists only in a diseased
                     imagination, and he who seeks it follows a shadow."</p>
                  <p>"It has nearly cost me my life," said Norman, "and has also separated me from
                     as true a woman as ever blessed the heart of man with her love."</p>
                  <p>"Accursed be all things," ejaculated the old man, "which lead us from the true
                     end and aim of existence. But come, my friend, we should not linger here."</p>
                  <p>As he rose up and took his lantern, Norman was surprised to see that it was
                     only a step he had fallen. Yet, nevertheless, he had sustained a severe injury,
                     for he found it utterly impossible to rise; and, fainting with pain, he sank
                     back again upon the ground.</p>
                  <p>"I will go for assistance," said Paulo.</p>
                  <p>In a few moments he returned with several others, who appeared to be miners
                     like himself. They raised Norman in their arms, and carried him to what was
                     apparently an outer apartment of the mine, where they lodged, and dressed their
                     food. It was a dismal place, with its high arched walls, black and rugged,
                     giving back the miners' voices in hollow echoes, and seeming more like a
                     sepulcher than the abode of human beings. A wild and fitful light from the fire
                     blazing in the corner spread itself out into the apartment; but it could not
                     penetrate the gloom of the more remote portions. Here they laid Norman on an
                     humble bed of straw; and, upon examination, it was found that his leg was
                     broken. Paulo, who was something of a surgeon, exercised his skill in his
                     behalf, and then left him to repose, while he went to assist the others in the
                     preparation of their evening meal.</p>
                  <p>Soon, many more of the miners entered; and, when all was ready, they sat down
                     in a group together. They had suspended their lanterns from a framework above
                     their heads; and, as the light shone down upon their faces, Norman raised
                     himself on his arm, and shuddered as he beheld them. Ghostly and grim, with
                     hollow cheeks and sunken eyes, they partook of their food as though it was
                     tasteless and insipid. Many of them were convicts, who had been condemned to
                     pass their lives in this unhealthy region, while others had been lured by the
                     love of gain.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" exclaimed one, "that I had but a morsel of the fine wheaten bread my good
                     wife used to set before me when I came home at night!"</p>
                  <p>"Hush!" said another: "this is no place to speak of <emph>home.</emph> Men like

                     where we are, and set our faces like flints to meet our hard fortune."</p>
                  <p>"I had a home once," said a third, "with a good old father and a mother, a
                     brother and a sister; but the devil told me to follow him, and I should be a
                     rich man. See now how he keeps his promises!" And he laughed with such a
                     hollow, heartless laugh, that it sounded like the cry of a troubled spirit.</p>
                  <p>"And I," cried a fourth, who sat apart from the others, and had not eaten a
                     morsel, "had a happy home, a wife, and four dear little children"—</p>
                  <p>He stopped, for his voice was choked with emotion; and, bowing his face upon
                     his hands, he wept like a child. Each turned away; for a tender chord was
                     touched, and they would not own their weakness.</p>
                  <p>"Friends," said Paulo as he pointed toward Norman, whom he supposed to be
                     asleep, "yonder lies a man who has sacrificed every thing, that he may search
                     for the great carbuncle. I would give all I possess, could I but turn him
                     about, and show him his error before it is too late; for in my own experience
                     have I proved it true, that a man may follow an object till he becomes a slave
                     to it, and can find no deliverance. It avails me little that I see my folly;
                     for habit has filled me with an eternal restlessness, and I must seek till I
                     find rest in the grave."</p>
                  <p>"Tell him," said the last speaker, as he wiped away his tears, "if he has a
                     patch of ground as big as his two hands, a wife to love, and a roof to cover
                     him, that he has all that is needful for earthly happiness, and no seeking will
                     obtain more."</p>
                  <p>A bell struck; and, at the sound, the miners started up, and, taking their
                     tools, went out.</p>
                  <p>"O Elsie! Elsie!" murmured Norman, "where art thou? God helping me, if I may
                     but recover from this mishap, I will seek thee the world over; and, when I find
                     thee, I will treasure thee in my heart as the most priceless of all
                     jewels."</p>
                  <p>Overcome with pain and exhaustion, he fell asleep. In his dreams, his old
                     mother came to him with tearful eyes; and, as she clasped her arms about him,
                     she whispered, "God bless you, my son!" His father took him by the hand, and
                     led him into the home of his childhood. The fragrance of the jessamines and
                     roses came in at the windows, and he heard the voices of the herdsmen and the
                     bleating of the wild goats. Then he wandered forth with Elsie along vine-clad
                     slopes, into a quiet wood, where silvery streams came leaping down the
                     mountain-side; and, as he looked up to the clear, still heights, he saw them
                     crimsoning in the sunset light. The vesper hymn came stealing up from the
                     valley; and it seemed to lift his soul, and bear it away to heaven upon its
                     wings. But it was all a dream.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <p>THE sun had set, and the moon shone full and clear above the tops of the
                     forest-trees, when Elsie awoke. She was chilled by the night air, and
                     frightened to find herself alone in this wild mountain solitude. With great
                     caution she arose, and, stealing forth into the<pb n="166-167"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000084"/> open way, looked timidly around. But she had
                     scarce taken one glance, when she hopped briskly back again, for she had seen
                     something which greatly terrified her. A most singular-looking being, mounted
                     upon a mule, was coming slowly up the road. Elsie hid herself behind a bush,
                     and looked out with anxious eyes. As the object of terror approached still
                     nearer, Elsie was delighted to find that this strange person was a woman. She
                     had on a long, dark skirt, a blue jacket fastened with bright buttons, and a
                     hat with a broad brim, the front of which was turned back, and made fast to the
                     crown. Her face was round and ruddy; and, as she jogged leisurely along, she
                     sung in a low but cheerful tone. Elsie took courage; and, emerging from the
                     bush, she hailed her.</p>
                  <p>"Lady," she said, "can you tell me how far it is to Lucerne?"</p>
                  <p>"Lucerne in Switzerland?" said the stranger, as she stopped short and looked
                     down at her: "no, indeed, I can not tell you, for it is a great way. But, my
                     dear child, how came you here alone, at this late hour?"</p>
                  <p>"I am <emph>not</emph> a child," replied Elsie with much dignity: "I am a
                     married woman."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I should scarcely have thought it. Where, then, is your home and your
                     husband?"</p>
                  <p>"My home is in Lucerne; but my husband went down the rocks yonder this morning,
                     where I refused to follow him. We parted in anger, and he said he would not
                     return."</p>
                  <p>"My dear little woman," said the stranger, "I fear you have not done the wisest
                     thing in the world, for no light cause should part those whom God has made one;
                     but, since it <emph>is</emph> so, take my advice. Go home with me to-night,
                     where you shall have a nice supper and a comfortable bed, and on the morrow we
                     will both search for your lost husband."</p>
                  <p>"But he <emph>will</emph> seek for the great carbuncle!" replied Elsie,
                     bursting into tears, "while I am dying for want of home and a
                     resting-place."</p>
                  <p>The strange lady put her arm kindly about her neck; and, stooping down, she
                     kissed her wet cheek.</p>
                  <p>"I pity him," she said; "for he will find many a sorrow in his way through
                     life, but the great carbuncle, <emph>never.</emph> Come, now, and get up behind
                     me. With our Lord's help, I will surely comfort your poor little heart."</p>
                  <p>She made room on her mule for Elsie; but, just then, Jack, who had been slowly
                     poking about in search of his mistress, thrust his head from the bushes with a
                     loud bray, as a rude token of recognition. Elsie called him forth; and,
                     mounting him, she followed after her kind friend.</p>
                  <p>Their way led directly down into the rocky valley whither Norman had gone. They
                     followed the steep, rough path for some time; and then they turned aside into a
                     narrow pass, through which they came into a level and fertile country. The
                     highly-cultivated fields and vineyards, the white cottages half hidden by
                     fragrant groves of orange-trees, and the streams gleaming like silver in the
                     moonlight, made it seem like fairy-land. The sound of a flute and tambourine
                     was heard in the distance; and Elsie's heart leaped for joy, when they came
                     suddenly upon a group of children<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6310-00000085"/>
                     dancing on the greensward. Several of them observed the approach of the
                     travelers, and ran toward them with cries of welcome.</p>
                  <p>"Here is our good Dorcas!" they exclaimed. "Here is our dear doctor!"</p>
                  <p>They gathered about Elsie's companion, shook her by the hand, and kissed her
                     with the greatest affection.</p>
                  <p>"How are your patients?" they asked; "and who is this you have brought with
                     you?"</p>
                  <p>"She is a poor woman whom I found on the other side of the mountain," replied
                     Dorcas. "She has lost her husband, and I shall keep her with me until we can
                     find him."</p>
                  <p>"Then she, too, is welcome," said the children. They came and took her by the
                     hand, and kissed her also, while the poor little woman laughed and cried at the
                     same time, not knowing what to say, for she was quite overcome by this
                     unexpected kindness. The children took the two mules by their bridles, the
                     flute and tambourine players went before, and thus they escorted the travelers
                     to the door of a fine-looking residence, where they were met by an old lady
                     with a very pleasant countenance.</p>
                  <p>"God bless you, dear mother!" said Dorcas, as she sprang from her mule. "How
                     have you been since I left you? I have brought you another daughter,—a poor,
                     lone creature, who needs our care and kindness."</p>
                  <p>The old woman welcomed Elsie; and the children left them, repeating their
                     "good-night" in cheerful tones, till it was lost to hearing in the
                     distance.</p>
                  <p>Every thing in and about the home of Dorcas was tasteful and elegant. There was
                     a rich carpet on the floor, handsome porcelain vases filled with rare flowers,
                     fine pictures and statuettes in parian, a harp in the corner, and a guitar on
                     the side-table, besides a great number of books. In the middle of the room was
                     a table with a snow-white cloth, spread with an abundance of inviting food.</p>
                  <p>Poor Elsie was astonished. She stood there with her short dress and ragged
                     shoes, her scorched face and tangled hair, looking like a gypsy beggar, and
                     feeling very much distressed. But the good Dorcas did not suffer her to remain
                     long thus. She gave her some water to wash herself; and then she brought her a
                     snug dress and a pair of her own shoes, which, although they were rather large,
                     were made to fit by thrusting a bit of paper into the toes.</p>
                  <p>After a hearty supper, Elsie was shown to a comfortable little chamber, where,
                     simple-hearted child that she was, she soon forgot all her troubles in a
                     refreshing sleep.</p>
                  <p>In the morning, after they had breakfasted, Dorcas conducted Elsie into the
                     garden, where several of the children who had welcomed them the night before
                     were making themselves very busy among the herbs and flowers. They wandered
                     along the shady pathways together, among fragrant groves of myrtle and orange,
                     for a long time. Dorcas was so sociable and friendly, that Elsie forgot her
                     reserve, and chatted away with her in her own simple, unaffected manner.</p>
                  <p>"Are those your children?" she asked, with a look of curiosity.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no!" said Dorcas, smiling: "I am not a married woman, and do not expect I
                     ever shall be."</p>
                  <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6310-00000086"/>
                  <p>"Why not?" said Elsie, before she could check herself; for women are always
                     anxious to know about such things.</p>
                  <p>"Because," replied Dorcas, "I hold that no one is under any <emph>moral
                        obligation</emph> to take that step, and that people seldom <emph>do</emph>
                     unless they think they shall thereby add in some measure to their interest or
                     happiness. Now I have all I wish or need,—health, money, and friends. I feel
                     that because of this God requires much of me, and I endeavor to do my duty. I
                     clothe and educate the poor children in the neighborhood, and have qualified
                     myself, as far as possible, to attend upon the sick and suffering. In doing
                     this I am happy, for it absorbs all my sympathies and affections; and, though I
                     do not claim to be unnatural, yet, until I can find one who will be a friend
                     and fellow-helper in my work, I shall not marry."</p>
                  <p>Elsie looked up to her in astonishment. "Oh!" she said, "I should die if I had
                     not some <emph>one</emph> to love, and who would love me in return. Even now my
                     poor heart is aching for Norman, and I would rather have him than the wealth of
                     the world beside!"</p>
                  <p>"That is right, my dear little woman! That is the true feeling," said Dorcas.
                     "Blessed be God, we do not all think alike! You are of such a loving, confiding
                     nature, that you <emph>must</emph> have something to cling to: and thereby God
                     has given you a power that is greater than wealth or wisdom; for there is
                     nothing on earth so mighty as love. Oh that all women and wives did but
                     understand their advantage, and knew how to use it wisely! I have half a mind
                     to go about and tell them; for a quiet observer can always see more than those
                     who are in the midst of the battle."</p>
                  <p>"I wish," said Elsie with a doleful countenance, "that I knew how to make
                     Norman leave his search for the great carbuncle, and go back with me to
                     Lucerne!"</p>
                  <p>"Dorcas! Dorcas!" called the old lady from the window, "you are wanted." And
                     Dorcas hastened to obey the summons.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                  <p>UPON entering the little parlor, she found an old man awaiting her, whom she
                     immediately recognized.</p>
                  <p>"How are you, good Paulo?" she said. "Are you in need of my services?"</p>
                  <p>"Not for myself, but for a poor unfortunate, who, in addition to his bodily
                     injuries, seems to have a great trouble on his mind. If you can possibly return
                     to the mines with me, you may have an opportunity of doing much good."</p>
                  <p>"Then," said Dorcas cheerfully, "you may be quite sure of my company."</p>
                  <p>She began her preparations immediately, and in a short time was mounted upon
                     her mule, pursuing her way toward the mountain-pass, while Paulo, with his
                     staff in his hand, walked briskly by her side.</p>
                  <p>"What a dismal place, good Paulo!" exclaimed Dorcas, as, leaving her mule
                     without, they entered the gloomy opening to the mine. "Here I should die of
                     grief and horror, if no worse evil befell me."</p>
                  <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6310-00000087"/>
                  <p>"To me, and to all who dwell herein," said Paulo, "it is the 'valley of the
                     shadow of death,' through which, we trust, we are traveling to a better
                     land."</p>
                  <p>Norman was indeed in a sad condition when this good Samaritan arrived. The
                     poisonous vapors of the mine, added to his suffering and anxiety, had nearly
                     thrown him into a fever. He seemed gentle and tractable; but his mind was
                     wandering, and he talked constantly of Elsie and the great carbuncle. As Dorcas
                     took his hand, and listened attentively to his words, her face brightened.</p>
                  <p>"Now may the Lord be praised," she said, "for thus bringing me to the aid of
                     this poor man! I will do him good in soul as well as body."</p>
                  <p>She soon administered to him a soothing draught, under the influence of which
                     he fell into a deep sleep.</p>
                  <p>"Paulo," said Dorcas, "if I would save my patient, he must not remain here a
                     moment longer. Call such of the miners as can be spared, and we will have him
                     carried to the dwelling of the widow who lives just on the other side of the
                     pass."</p>
                  <p>Paulo hastened to obey her orders; and, when Norman awoke, he was in the house
                     of the widow. Dorcas sat by his bed, and the dim light from the window shone
                     upon her cheerful countenance.</p>
                  <p>"Lady," said Norman as he gazed around, "can you tell me what has befallen me?
                     I have had a troubled dream, and even now I scarce seem to be awake."</p>
                  <p>"Alas!" he continued, as he sank back on his pillow, "I remember now. O Elsie!
                     Elsie! I could bear the loss of all things, if you only had been spared
                     me!"</p>
                  <p>"I am your friend," said Dorcas kindly. "Speak freely of your troubles to me,
                     and I will do all in my power to assist you."</p>
                  <p>There was something in her look and manner that inspired confidence; and
                     Norman, without much hesitation, told her of his separation from Elsie, his
                     subsequent loss, and his misfortune in the mine.</p>
                  <p>"Let your heart be at rest," said Dorcas, when he had ended. "You are in good
                     hands, where you will be well cared for. Your wife shall be found and restored
                     to you, and every thing shall be done to hasten your recovery to health and
                     happiness. But it must be under these conditions,—that you keep quiet and ask
                     no questions; for I warn you, that, even if you should, you would not be likely
                     to receive satisfactory answers."</p>
                  <p>Norman could ill bear such restrictions; but, as he turned him about, his leg
                     gave a sharp twinge, and he felt compelled to submit. Dorcas soon took leave,
                     with the promise that she would visit him often; and Norman was left alone to
                     his reflections, which, from the present point of view, tended to show his past
                     life and employment in rather an unfavorable light.</p>
                  <p>Dorcas had told him that he was in the house of a widow, lately bereaved;
                     therefore he was not at all surprised, when, after the first day, a small,
                     delicate female made her appearance in his room, clad in black, with a heavy
                     embroidered lace veil thrown over her head in such a way as to entirely conceal
                     her features. She appeared to be very attentive, moving noiselessly<pb
                        n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6310-00000088"/> about, and anticipating his wishes
                     in the smallest things. He watched her with great interest, and, at last,
                     ventured to ask her several questions; but she seemed not to hear, and did not
                     make the least reply.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding all her good care, as the time passed on, Norman grew restless
                     and uneasy. His thoughts turned constantly back to Lucerne, toward which he had
                     no doubt Elsie was still wandering; and often, when he supposed himself alone,
                     he would pray aloud that God would protect her, and at last unite them in love
                     once more in their happy home.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes he dreamed that Elsie came to him, and, throwing her arms about his
                     neck, kissed him again and again. So actual did this seem, that he would start
                     up at once from his sleep; but, when he looked around, he saw no one but the
                     veiled widow, and she spoke not a word.</p>
                  <p>Dorcas still continued her visits; and, through her skillful treatment, after
                     several weeks he was enabled to walk about his room, supported by a staff; and
                     soon he ventured out into the pleasant, well-cultivated garden in the rear of
                     the cottage. From this time his little veiled attendant disappeared; and in her
                     place he saw a woman much larger and coarser, who, after all, proved to be the
                     widow, the lady of the house. He was very much puzzled, but could get no
                     satisfactory answers to his inquiries. One morning, as he sat upon the stone
                     bench near the door of the cottage, Dorcas came riding gayly along on her mule,
                     looking uncommonly cheerful and good-natured.</p>
                  <p>"How are you, friend Norman?" she asked. "Why, you really look quite fresh and
                     bright! and I would not wonder if you should soon be able to commence your
                     search again for the great carbuncle."</p>
                  <p>Norman shook his head sorrowfully. "'Before I was afflicted, I went astray,'"
                     he said; "but now I trust I am a wiser man, and I only seek for those humble
                     enjoyments in which there is both peace and profit."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, well!" said Dorcas; "but one wishes to gain fame and a great name in this
                     world; and, if you <emph>should</emph> find the great carbuncle, think what a
                     mighty man it would make of you!"</p>
                  <p>"Give me back my Elsie," said Norman, "and my peaceful home, and I will ask for
                     nothing more."</p>
                  <p>"But," replied Dorcas, "supposing that even now I would place a rich treasure
                     in your hands: would you not take it in exchange for your little Elsie, about
                     whom you make such an ado?"</p>
                  <p>"No, nothing!" said Norman decidedly. "She is worth all the wealth of the world
                     to me!"</p>
                  <p>"How contrary and perverse you men are!" said Dorcas in an impatient manner.
                     "You almost lose your lives in seeking for a thing; and, just when it is within
                     your grasp, your interest is gone, and you cry out for something beyond your
                     reach. Come with me, and see if I can not tempt you."</p>
                  <p>"I will go with you," said Norman, smiling, "because you have been a good
                     friend to me; but I do not fear in the least that you will make me change my
                     mind."</p>
                  <p>Another mule was soon procured, and they started for the home of Dorcas. Upon
                     their arrival, she conducted him into the garden, where, as usual, a great<pb
                        n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6310-00000089"/> many children were employed in
                     various ways. As soon as they observed Norman and Dorcas, they came flocking
                     about them with eager faces; but she waved them aside, and continued on through
                     a shady path, till they came to a little arbor.</p>
                  <p>"Here," said Dorcas, "do I keep my treasure; and, if you refuse to accept it, I
                     will never forgive you."</p>
                  <p>Norman gave his head a most decided shake. They entered, and upon a low bench
                     sat the veiled lady.</p>
                  <p>"Now, Norman," said Dorcas, "be cruel if you can."</p>
                  <p>She threw back the veil, and revealed the well-known features of Elsie, her
                     eyes sparkling with tears, and her whole face glowing with mirth and
                     gladness.</p>
                  <p>One joyful cry from Norman, and she was clasped in his arms. He covered her
                     face with kisses, and called her by all those endearing names which fond
                     husbands usually apply to their beloved wives. Oh! it was a delightful scene;
                     and the good Dorcas, though she had no experience in matrimonial affairs,
                     looked on with the greatest satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Thereupon the children, who had been lingering around, came hopping in at the
                     door of the arbor, like so many summer-birds, calling out to one another, "This
                     poor woman has found her husband! Our good little Elsie is happy once
                     more."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                  <p>ON a clear summer evening in Lucerne, as the last rays of sunset light faded
                     from the sky, an old woman sat by her door and spun. On the step near her was a
                     gray-haired man, quietly smoking his pipe. The heart of the spinner did not
                     seem to be in her work; for soon the wheel ceased its busy hum, the thread hung
                     loosely in her hand, and she raised the corner of her apron to wipe the tears
                     from her eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, that our Lord would grant my prayer!" she said, "and let me see my darling
                     Elsie once more before I die!"</p>
                  <p>"Ah, me!" responded the old man: "that has been my constant thought this last
                     year; and in my dreams I have wandered all over the face of the earth in search
                     of her."</p>
                  <p>As they talked together, a crowd of people were seen coming down the road.</p>
                  <p>"What does that mean?" cried the old man, starting up. He shaded his eyes with
                     his hands, and looked earnestly forward.</p>
                  <p>"It is! it is!" he exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>Down dropped his precious German pipe, which, next to his wife, he considered
                     his chief treasure. Up sprang the old lady also; and heedless of her fine-spun
                     yarn, which tangled about her feet like a snare, she followed her husband up
                     the road. The crowd of acquaintances and friends parted, and the next moment<pb
                        n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6310-00000090"/> the old people were weeping for joy
                     on the necks of their children.</p>
                  <p>"Who would not be a wise man, and go in search of the great carbuncle, if he
                     could come back looking so fresh and fine!" cried out one of the villagers.
                     "Tell me, Norman, are you a rich man?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, truly so," he replied.</p>
                  <p>"What great discoveries have you made? and what have you learned?" said
                     another.</p>
                  <p>"That man's highest aim should be to know himself."</p>
                  <p>"Have you found the great carbuncle?" cried out a third, who elbowed his way
                     through the crowd and stood before him with open mouth and eager eyes.</p>
                  <p>"No," said Norman; "but I have found 'the jewel of contentment,' which is far
                     better."</p>

                  <p>JUST at sunset, at the close of a delightful summer day, Mr. Christopher
                     Loveland, a well-known professor of physiology, with his friend Morris Ayer,
                     walked leisurely along the principal street of the flourishing town of C——. In
                     this place, and at this time, it was customary, as it is in many New-England
                     towns, for the young people to leave their homes for an evening promenade along
                     the main street, which conducted to a spring of remarkably cold water, about a
                     mile distant from the center of the town. Of course, this was a favorite walk
                     for young lovers, and for those who, to use a common but significant
                     expression, were yet in the market. Therefore, to an interested student of
                     human nature, this street afforded a most favorable opportunity both for
                     reflection and observation.</p>
                  <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6310-00000091"/>
                  <p>This, however, did not seem to be the purpose of the gentlemen to whom we have
                     alluded. Morris Ayer, with his portfolio beneath his arm, was wholly
                     unconscious of the glances bestowed upon his handsome countenance by numberless
                     bright eyes; and the professor, who seemed to take the lead in conversation,
                     with both thumbs thrust into the armholes of his vest, and his eyes glancing
                     straight forward through his gold-bowed spectacles to the ground, appeared to
                     be wholly engrossed in the subject of conversation.</p>
                  <p>"I tell you, Morris," he said, "both from observation and experience, I have
                     found it an incontrovertible fact, that a healthy soul can not dwell in a sick
                     body. The physical is the foundation of the spiritual, and herein lies the
                     secret of power; for according to the fineness and firmness of the outer will
                     be the condition and character of the inner man. Therefore you may rest
                     assured, my friend, that to your handsome countenance, and the harmony of your
                     physical system, you owe that attractive influence which secures you so many
                     friends."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you for the compliment to my personal appearance, professor; but yet I
                     doubt the soundness of your argument. You reason in a backward course, from
                     effect to cause. The spirit alone is the center of power, and the body its
                     medium of manifestation. I have seen too clear an illustration of this to doubt
                     it. In my recent travels, while at Liverpool in England, I met with a man who
                     seemed to be one entire combination of natural incongruity and deformity. He
                     was dwarfed and misshapen in every way, and was, for the greater part of the
                     time, confined to his room by sickness; and yet he exerted a most wonderful
                     power over every one who came within his circle of influence. I have sat and
                     listened to his conversation with delight for hours; and his words have gone
                     down deeper into my heart, and kindled within me loftier purposes, than those
                     of any other man. True power lies in intellect; and he who has the largest
                     share of this does the most to sway the destinies of his fellow-men."</p>
                  <p>"Very well, Morris: you may be right in part; but then it is a fact which it is
                     not worth while for you to dispute, that your handsome face and figure does far
                     more to secure you the favor of the ladies, than all the charms of your
                     intellect."</p>
                  <p>"I have known that at times to my sorrow, professor. I have been awarded undue
                     honor for a natural advantage, which I share equally, perhaps, with many a
                     drummajor or militia captain; while that of which I might justly be proud, the
                     hard-earned treasures of my intellect, has passed almost wholly unnoticed.
                     Therefore I have sometimes frowned like a thunder-cloud upon those foolish,
                     flippant butterflies, whose bewildered eyes were so delighted with externals,
                     that the real worth of the man was left unrecognized. Without vanity, I can say
                     that I know my outward appearance is attractive, and my address prepossessing;
                     but I have counted such things as nothing, since the only woman that I ever
                     truly esteemed turned coldly from me."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Morris! how was that? That is something entirely new to me."</p>
                  <p>"It is no secret, and I am not at all sensitive, at present, on the subject.
                     About five years since, before I started on my foreign tour, I became
                     acquainted, in my native town, with the oldest daughter of a large and<pb
                        n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6310-00000092"/> poor family. What the secret
                     fascination was which attracted me toward her, I can not tell, for she was not
                     remarkably beautiful; but there was something in the glances of her clear, dark
                     eyes, in her calm demeanor, and natural strength of character, which commanded
                     my admiration and esteem. I rendered her all the devotion of a young and
                     enthusiastic nature, although I knew there were many fairer and wealthier
                     ladies, over whose affections I might obtain a more speedy victory. But it was
                     all in vain; for she turned coldly as an iceberg from me, and answered my
                     impassioned pleadings with the same indifferent tone which she used in the most
                     common conversation."</p>
                  <p>"And what did you do then!"</p>
                  <p>"Do! I found myself obliged to decide between a brain-fever and a voyage to
                     Europe, and preferred the latter."</p>
                  <p>"A wise choice, Morris. Doubtless, this lady of whom you speak was of a cold,
                     nervous, and bilious temperament, and was utterly incapable of appreciating the
                     strength of your devotion. Such people usually excel in intellectual
                     brilliancy, but are at heart selfish, jealous, ambitious, and can only be
                     contented in occupying some position where they can rule supreme. In all
                     probability, should you see her now, after your last five years of observation
                     and experience, you would wonder at your early preference. Where is the lady at
                     present?"</p>
                  <p>"I know not. Upon my return, I only asked one question concerning her, if she
                     were married; and, receiving an answer in the affirmative, I inquired no
                     further. But allow me to say, professor, you are wrong in your idea concerning
                     her. You know, that, in connection with my literary pursuits, I have made
                     character my study in all its different phases. I have entered upon this with a
                     heartfelt interest, until now it has become almost a mania with me. In the same
                     way in which you use the dissecting knife, the lance, and the scalpel, have I
                     used the keen eye of my understanding, going down deep into human hearts, and
                     causing some souls to writhe with agony, as I have brought up secrets to the
                     light which they had supposed could be known to God and themselves only. None
                     save this woman ever successfully resisted me; and to this day the power which
                     she exercised not only over myself, but others, still remains a mystery."</p>
                  <p>"I would like to see her myself, Morris; for her physical with her mental and
                     moral construction would prove an interesting study to me. Dare I ask the favor
                     of her name?"</p>
                  <p>"Freely. Gertrude Carysford formerly; but what it is now I know not."</p>
                  <p>"What!" exclaimed the professor, as he stopped short, and seized his friend by
                     the arm. This is truly astonishing! Had I asked you the question a few moments
                     later, you might have answered in the hearing of the lady herself. Do you see
                     yonder fine-looking mansion on our right, with those magnificent elms in front?
                     That is Laureldell, the residence of Gertrude Carysford, or, at present, Mrs.
                     Raynor; and there by the gate, almost hidden by the shrubbery, stands the lady
                     herself, awaiting the return of her husband from his place of business in the
                     city."</p>
                  <p>"Let us turn back," said Morris quickly. "I do not<pb n="184-185"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000093"/> wish to meet her to-night." And accordingly they
                     took another direction.</p>
                  <p>"I do not wonder now, Morris," resumed the professor, "at what you have said.
                     For the last three years I have been a frequent visitor at Laureldell; and I
                     must confess, that between the character of the calm, dignified Mrs. Raynor,
                     and the relations which she now sustains, there is a great contradiction, and
                     yet, to all appearances, the most perfect harmony. Within the four walls of
                     that house the most opposite characters have met together; but, with the
                     closest observation, I can not spy out the least element of discord. The
                     husband, who is many years her senior, is one of our most ordinary
                     business-men. His only talent seems to be that of money-making, which he has
                     exercised to great advantage. He is a good judge of wine and cigars; is always
                     well posted up in the price-current of beef, pork, flour, grain, &amp;c.; knows
                     all the latest arrivals and clearances, and is an excellent hand at whist and
                     backgammon. He was a widower when he married Gertrude Carysford, and had an
                     unmarried daughter only some five or six years younger than the present Mrs.
                     Raynor. She is a perfect beauty, and the wildest, most ungovernable elf ever
                     let loose upon society. The step-mother alone seems to have her in
                     leading-strings. To her she is respectful and deferential as need be; but I do
                     not think there is any great depth of affection between them."</p>
                  <p>As the two gentlemen continued their conversation, they turned aside into a
                     narrow lane, shaded on either hand by overhanging locusts and a thick growth of
                     shrubbery. This way continued some distance, and then turned off in a sharp
                     angle to the left, leading along in the rear of the grounds belonging to
                     Laureldell.</p>
                  <p>"Do you say, professor," asked Morris thoughtfully, "that Mrs. Raynor appears
                     to be happy in her present situation? Gertrude Carysford was a girl of
                     cultivated tastes and a fine intellect; therefore I do not see how it is
                     possible for her to find sympathy or enjoyment in such associations."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! she does just as she pleases, and makes up for all deficiencies in home
                     relations by opening her house to the educated and <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >élite</foreign> far and near. In her evening parties, you will be sure to
                     find people from the very best society. She, however, is the central star of
                     the literati. Mr. Raynor interests himself with the less refined and
                     cultivated; while Hesper the daughter flirts with all the young gentlemen, and
                     plays off a thousand wild pranks, which, in any other person, would be
                     considered inexcusable."</p>
                  <p>"Take care, take care, gentlemen!" cried out a female voice; and at the same
                     instant a lady, mounted upon a white horse, in full gallop, turned the corner
                     directly upon them. So sudden, so unexpected, was this appearance, that the
                     gentlemen scarce knew which way to turn for safety. The professor seized Morris
                     quickly by the arm to draw him aside; but as he did so he stumbled over a
                     slight hillock in the way, and they both came to the ground together. The lady
                     reined in her horse with a sudden jerk; but the movement was vain, for with one
                     bound the high-spirited animal sprang over the fallen heroes, and dashed on his
                     way, snorting and plunging like a mad creature.</p>
                  <p>"Am I whole, or am I not?" said the professor,<pb n="186-187"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000094"/> with a bewildered look, as he raised himself up,
                     and laid his hand on various parts of his body. His highly-prized brown beaver
                     had received sundry ludicrous indentations, and his most immaculate white vest
                     bore visible tokens of its contact with the soil.</p>
                  <p>"Morris Ayer," he continued gravely to his friend, who was almost dead with
                     laughter, "this is your first introduction to Miss Hesper Raynor; and if, in
                     your future acquaintance with her, you always come off as easily, you may
                     consider yourself very fortunate."</p>
                  <p>After some search, the professor's spectacles were found swinging safely upon a
                     stately mullein-stalk, while Morris Ayer recovered his portfolio from the midst
                     of a giant burdock.</p>
                  <p>"How would you like to make a call upon this interesting lady to-morrow?" asked
                     the professor. "I would be very happy to give you a more polite introduction,
                     though I could not insure you a more agreeable reception."</p>
                  <p>"With all my heart," said Morris. "Mrs. Raynor herself I do not care to see;
                     but, for the sake of the daughter, I will accompany you. I need a new character
                     to study, and a new subject for my pen. Hesper Raynor shall be my next literary
                     victim; and, if flirtation is her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">forte,</foreign> she
                     will find in me one who can easily play the same game, and, if need be, punish
                     her as she deserves."</p>

                  <p>GOOD Mrs. Willoughby, the housekeeper at Laureldell, had completed her morning
                     arrangements. Every thing was in perfect order; and now, after arraying herself
                     in her favorite dress of white dimity, and a finely-embroidered cap, with wide,
                     flowing strings, she seated herself at her chamber window, and commenced anew
                     her labor of sewing inch pieces of satin together, which in the end was
                     intended for a chair-covering. So entirely absorbed did the good lady become in
                     her employment, that she was regardless of all beside, when she was suddenly
                     startled by the entrance of sundry light missiles at her open window, in the
                     shape of cherries, gooseberries, &amp;c. Whence they came it was impossible for
                     her to imagine. At first, it would seem as though the days of witchcraft had
                     returned, and this was their chosen method of manifestation; but, upon a
                     continuation of the favors, she perceived that they came from the midst of the
                     large linden-tree which shaded her window.</p>
                  <p>"Hesper!" she called out, "Hesper, are you there?" A light laugh, and a
                     rustling of the boughs, was the only reply.</p>
                  <p>"For shame!" continued the good lady in a deprecating tone. "A young lady of
                     your age and education<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6310-00000095"/> ought to know
                     better than to make such a hoyden of herself. Go down quick, I say, before you
                     break your neck, or Mrs. Raynor finds out you are there."</p>
                  <p>"Which I think is most to be dreaded of the two, Mrs. Willoughby. Please give
                     my love to my lady step-mother, and tell her I should be happy to receive a
                     call from her up here in my green-house parlor as soon as she can make it
                     convenient. She needn't take the trouble to send up her card first; for I don't
                     like ceremonious visitors." And hereupon the reckless girl advanced still
                     farther along the bough on which she sat, and swung up and down with the most
                     daring temerity. Good Mrs. Willoughby upset her work-basket with all its
                     precious contents as she sprang from her seat, and called out in the greatest
                     alarm,—</p>
                  <p>"Hesper Raynor, if you have any pity on me, go down this instant, and not let
                     me see you dashed in pieces before my eyes."</p>
                  <p>"What will you give me, Mrs. Willoughby, if I will go down directly?" asked
                     Hesper, as her elfish countenance, surrounded by the most disorderly ringlets,
                     peered out from among the boughs.</p>
                  <p>"Any thing you have a mind to say, only go down this instant."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, give me a chance to see Harry Anderson as often as I please,
                     without letting Mrs. Raynor know. Now, remember."</p>
                  <p>A few moments after, to the good lady's great relief, she saw a fairy foot,
                     incased in a French kid slipper, appear near the trunk of the tree; but the
                     next instant it was withdrawn.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, dear! Mrs. Willoughby," called out Hesper in a suppressed tone, "there
                     comes Professor Loveland and a stranger gentleman up the avenue. I verily
                     believe he is the one I ran over last night. If this isn't a pretty fix! Do for
                     pity's sake run down and entertain them in the parlor till I can make my
                     escape."</p>
                  <p>"Well, be quick, then;" and the obliging house-keeper ran down to the
                     hall-door, which stood open.</p>
                  <p>"Good-morning, Mrs. Willoughby," said the professor very politely. "This is my
                     friend Mr. Morris Ayer, lately returned from Europe. Is Miss Hesper
                     within?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, I believe she is about the house somewhere," replied Mrs. Willoughby.
                     "Please step into the parlor, gentlemen, and I will call her."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you," said the professor, as he wiped the perspiration from his brow.
                     "As it is so very warm, we should prefer taking a seat under the linden-tree
                     here, while you look up the wild bird."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, gentlemen," said the worthy housekeeper, with evident confusion, "I
                     would advise you to do no such thing, on account of caterpillars. I never in
                     all my life knew such a year for them! They are everywhere, everywhere! It was
                     only yesterday that Harry Anderson, our gardener, killed any quantity of them
                     under that same tree: so pray come into the parlor, gentlemen, you will find it
                     nice and cool there; besides, we have some most excellent sherbet, which I have
                     no doubt will prove very refreshing."</p>
                  <p>"As you please, good Mrs. Willoughby," said the professor, with whom her
                     concluding words had great effect.</p>
                  <p>The gentlemen were accordingly ushered into the<pb n="190-191"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000096"/> parlor; and, after supplying them with sherbet,
                     Mrs. Willoughby left them to hasten Hesper in her preparations. But neither in
                     the tree, nor anywhere else, was she to be found; and, greatly vexed, the good
                     lady returned to the house, and apprised Mrs. Raynor of the presence of
                     visitors. The worthy housekeeper had no talent for conversation; but she took
                     it upon herself as a moral duty to entertain the gentlemen until the appearance
                     of the lady of the house, and therefore she exerted herself to do her best.</p>
                  <p>It was not long, however, before a light step was heard on the stairs, and a
                     great rustling of silks at the door. The next moment, Mrs. Raynor, in all her
                     queen-like dignity, stood face to face with Morris Ayer, who rose to receive
                     her. To her it was an unexpected meeting, as Mrs. Willoughby, in the confusion
                     of the moment, had forgotten his name, and therefore spoke of him only as a
                     stranger gentleman; yet any one would have judged, by the calm, undisturbed
                     expression of her countenance, and the quiet manner in which she offered her
                     hand, that they were the friends of yesterday, and that no words of deeper
                     significance had ever passed between them than those of the most common
                     acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>The pride of Morris Ayer was aroused by her indifference, and he determined to
                     make her feel his power. All his intellectual resources, all the brilliancy of
                     his wit, and his superior conversational powers, were brought into requisition;
                     and ere long he perceived, with secret gratification, that he had not only won
                     her attention, but her interest. Even the professor and Mrs. Willoughby left
                     their gossiping, and, drawing their chairs still nearer, listened with wonder
                     and admiration to the young author, who not only spoke in words, but also in
                     the eloquent glances of his eyes, and the changing expressions of feeling which
                     passed like light and shadow over his countenance. The time sped by unheeded,
                     and Hesper—Where was she?</p>
                  <p>No sooner had Mrs. Willoughby ushered the gentlemen into the parlor than Hesper
                     had slipped as lightly and stealthily as a cat from the tree; and seizing her
                     broad-brimmed hat from a currant-bush, where she had previously deposited it,
                     she started for the orchard, at some distance in the rear of house. Here,
                     beneath the overhanging trees, a tall, finely-formed young man was engaged in
                     spreading hay. At the sound of her footsteps, he turned, and greeted her with a
                     pleasant smile.</p>
                  <p>"Good-morning, Hesper," he said: "what mischief is ahead now? or, I should
                     rather ask, what have you already been about, for you look very much like a
                     fugitive from justice."</p>
                  <p>"Not from justice exactly, Harry, but from that stupid old Professor Loveland
                     and the young man I ran over last night. I tell you what, it was impossible for
                     me to stay and meet them after what I had done. I would have helped the
                     accident if I could; but Spry was too smart for me: and now, if I should
                     attempt an apology, I should laugh right out in their faces."</p>
                  <p>"O Hesper Raynor!" said the young man in a warning tone, as he leaned on his
                     pitchfork, and looked her pleasantly in the face, "you are a sad, naughty girl,
                     and I don't know what will become of you in the end."</p>
                  <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6310-00000097"/>
                  <p>"Nor I either," replied Hesper, with a look of the most arch drollery, "unless
                     some kind-hearted, sensible young man, who understands me, will take me under
                     his special guidance and protection."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Hesper!" said Harry, shaking his head. "There are few men who would dare
                     undertake such an arduous task."</p>
                  <p>In a moment, the smiles faded from Hesper's countenance. She held her hat
                     silently in her hand, while the wind played recklessly with her ringlets,
                     tossing them over her face, and veiling the eyes which had begun to moisten
                     with tears.</p>
                  <p>"Harry," she said at last in a tremulous tone, "I am the most unfortunate girl
                     in the world; for nobody understands me. I am called a mischievous elf, a
                     heartless flirt, a finished coquette, and other names equally as flattering and
                     complimentary; but no one seems to think that I have a single good feeling or
                     serious thought. I know I am not what I should be; but it is because I am not
                     rightly situated. I never was born to be a lady, or live a life that is all
                     outside show and pretension; and when a troop of silly fellows come flattering
                     and fawning around me, talking of my beauty, and thinking of my money. I treat
                     them just as I think they deserve. But, Harry, if I should ever meet with a man
                     whom I could truly love and esteem, it should be the work of my life to make
                     myself worthy of him. Be he high or low, rich or poor, in every possible way
                     would I prove my devotion. I would wash and spin, bake and brew, and, if need
                     be, split wood for him; only let him be a true man, who is not ashamed to use
                     his hands as well as his head, and not one of those conceited fops or rhyming
                     scribblers blers which my lady step-mother takes such delight in calling around
                     her. I did believe that you, at least, Harry, understood me; but I see that I
                     am mistaken." And, as she ceased speaking, the tears which had trembled in her
                     eyes rolled silently down her cheeks.</p>
                  <p>The young man bit his lips as though he would suppress some strong emotion.
                     "Hesper," he said, as he extended her his hand, "I <emph>do</emph> understand
                     you; and, were you and I in different situations, I would speak to you freely
                     from my heart: but, as it is, the less we talk together the better it will be
                     for both."</p>
                  <p>Hesper's large dark eyes were raised meekly to his. No one would have believed
                     that this quiet, serious maiden, and the reckless, ungovernable Hesper Raynor
                     were the same; but it was the instinctive deference which a true-hearted woman
                     ever pays to genuine manliness and worth. He gazed earnestly in her face, and
                     one moment later Harry Anderson's heart was no longer his own. Love belongs not
                     to circumstance, it is one of the decrees of fate.</p>
                  <p>The sound of voices, however, suddenly attracted their attention; and, glancing
                     through the trees, Hesper saw the professor and his friend coming directly
                     toward the orchard. Quick as thought, she threw her hat upon the ground, and
                     covered it with the loose hay; and the next instant she had concealed herself
                     in a rick that was left standing. Harry immediately proceeded to another part
                     of the orchard, and continued his labor.</p>
                  <p>The two gentlemen sauntered leisurely along, making many remarks upon the
                     general appearance of the trees, till they came to the place of Hesper's
                     concealment.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! what is this?" said Morris, as he stooped to<pb n="194-195"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000098"/> pick up a blue ribbon, and, greatly to his
                     surprise, found it attached to a lady's hat.</p>
                  <p>"That is Hesper's!" exclaimed the professor, "and I tell you what, Morris,
                     there is mischief in the wind. We tread upon enchanted ground; and it would not
                     be strange, if, before we left the place, we should become her victims."</p>
                  <p>"I am not at all afraid," said Morris. "From all you say of her, I am disposed
                     to think her nothing more than a spoiled beauty; and if, upon acquaintance, I
                     find her the careless flirt you have described, I will make love to her with
                     all my might, and then punish her in the name of all her disconsolate
                     admirers."</p>
                  <p>With these words, he threw the hat carelessly upon the ground, and the two
                     gentlemen continued their walk through the orchard. They had, however, gone but
                     a short distance, when a fair head appeared from the midst of the hay-rick, and
                     a white hand was raised with a threatening gesture.</p>
                  <p>"Make love to me, will you?" said Hesper in a suppressed tone, "and then punish
                     me in the name of all my disconsolate admirers, you ungracious biped! Well,
                     begin as soon as you please, and let us see which will gain the victory; but,
                     if I am not mistaken, my <emph>disconsolate admirers</emph> will not be greatly
                     benefited by <emph>your</emph> services."</p>

                  <p>UPON the confines of the estate of Laureldell was a picturesque looking
                     cottage, almost hidden from view by the luxuriant growth of roses and jasmine,
                     and the spreading larches which waved their tasseled branches in the wind, and
                     made pleasant music through the summer nights. This was the home of Harry
                     Anderson and his sister Ellen, his nearest surviving relative. Although he was
                     several years her senior, and had enjoyed much more favorable opportunities for
                     education, yet he always looked to her for counsel in all his undertakings; and
                     throughout the whole neighborhood, so useful had she become, both in the way of
                     advice and assistance, that she was considered a common treasure; and Ellen
                     Anderson's word of judgment was sufficient to settle some of the most difficult
                     disputes.</p>
                  <p>Whenever the arrival of guests at Laureldell rendered the household duties
                     somewhat arduous for Mrs. Willoughby and the servants usually employed, the
                     assistance of Ellen was sought; and then every thing seemed to work by magic.
                     Mrs. Raynor soon discovered her worth, and to no other person did she exhibit a
                     greater degree of friendly confidence and good-will. She even sought her
                     company; and often, upon some quiet summer afternoon, Mrs. Raynor turned away
                     with a look of weariness from the elegantly-furnished rooms at Laureldell<pb
                        n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6310-00000099"/> dell, and directed her course
                     through the green, shady lane, to spend a few hours with Ellen Anderson in her
                     cottage home. It really seemed a relief to the cold, proud lady, to lay aside
                     her stately dignity for a time, and talk like a quiet, sensible woman with this
                     gentle-hearted girl.</p>
                  <p>To look at Ellen's smooth, white brow, and smiling eyes, one would suppose that
                     scarce twenty summers had passed over her head; but she was already in her
                     twenty-sixth year, and the same age with Mrs. Raynor. This fact assisted
                     somewhat in attracting the stately lady toward her; and, moreover, Ellen never
                     shrank from her, nor seemed to feel the chill of her presence. She had the
                     happy faculty of saying just the right thing at the right time. Some people
                     considered this friendship rather singular; but Hesper never wondered at it one
                     moment. Everybody loved Ellen, she said; and she looked upon it as a redeeming
                     trait in her step-mother's character, that she should attach herself to one so
                     entirely worthy of love and esteem. In truth, she really envied her the
                     privilege of visiting Ellen whenever she chose. As for herself, an instinctive
                     delicacy, a maidenly modesty, prevented her from turning her steps often to the
                     home of Harry Anderson.</p>
                  <p>It so happened, that, upon the evening of the same day on which Morris Ayer
                     made his first call at Laureldell, Hesper strolled leisurely along the green
                     lane to gather hawthorn-blossoms from the hedges. She had been engaged thus but
                     a short time, when Harry Anderson, walking at a quick pace, came suddenly upon
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Hesper!" he said, "this happens exactly as it should. Ellen will be
                     entirely alone this evening, until quite late, and will be rejoiced to have
                     your company."</p>
                  <p>After a few moments' conversation, he passed on; and Hesper, glad of the
                     opportunity, turned her steps in the direction of the cottage. She was in one
                     of her happiest moods; and Ellen, who always enjoyed her company, felt that the
                     time was passing too quickly as they chatted and sewed together.</p>
                  <p>"Hesper," said Ellen at last, in the course of conversation, "how is Mrs.
                     Raynor to-day? I had quite forgotten to ask about her."</p>
                  <p>"Sick, poor woman!" replied Hesper with a serious look. "After Professor
                     Loveland and his friend called this morning, she had one of her most violent
                     nervous attacks. I had a mind to run directly for you, as you have such a
                     wonderful faculty of soothing her at such times; but she would not allow me to
                     do so. She shut herself up in her chamber, and begged to be left entirely
                     alone. She looked so wretchedly sick and pale, that I pitied her with all my
                     heart, and could not help stealing to her door several times to listen. I am
                     sure that I heard her sobbing as though her heart would break; and though I
                     don't love her any better than I should, yet, like a great simpleton, I
                     couldn't help crying too."</p>
                  <p>Ellen made no reply, but bent her head still nearer her work, and continued her
                     sewing.</p>
                  <p>"What do you suppose it means?" resumed Hesper. "I believe she is dreadfully
                     unhappy, and I'm sure I don't wonder. I couldn't be happy either, if I lived so
                     entirely in myself, with no one to love me. It's her own fault, though, for I
                     have tried often enough to show my friendly feelings toward her; but she is
                     cold as an<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6310-00000100"/> iceberg, and meets my
                     advances with such indifference, that I am quite in despair."</p>
                  <p>At this moment, a light tap was heard at the door. Ellen started up with
                     surprise. "That is her rap," she said; "but can it indeed be her?"</p>
                  <p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Hesper, "I hope not; for I wouldn't have her see me here
                     for the world."</p>
                  <p>She listened attentively as Ellen stepped to the door; and, catching the sound
                     of her step-mother's well-known voice, the next instant she had safely
                     concealed herself behind the bed-curtains. Ellen looked around in surprise upon
                     her return to the room, and then immediately concluded that Hesper had passed
                     out at the door in the rear of the cottage.</p>
                  <p>"Please take a chair, Mrs. Raynor," said Ellen. "You look pale and sick
                     to-night: will you have a glass of water?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, thank you," said the lady, as she seated herself wearily in a chair, and,
                     leaning her elbow upon the table, covered her face with her hand. "I
                        <emph>am</emph> sick in soul and body, Ellen; and, after thinking all day, I
                     felt at last that I must speak to some one who could sympathize with me, or I
                     should die from mental suffering."</p>
                  <p>For several months past, Ellen had observed how thin and pale Mrs. Raynor had
                     grown, and what a sad, careworn expression had settled upon her countenance.
                     Now it was still more apparent; and as the kind-hearted girl drew up her chair,
                     and took the delicate white hand of the lady in her own, she found it burning
                     with fever.</p>
                  <p>"Why, Mrs. Raynor!" she exclaimed, "you should not have come out to-night. You
                     have already taken cold, and this evening air will do you no good."</p>
                  <p>"It matters little," she replied with a careless smile: "my spirit is wearing
                     out my body as fast as possible, and I will thank Nature to assist me. O Ellen!
                     I am the most unhappy woman in the world, and I have no one to blame but
                     myself."</p>
                  <p>"Speak out," said Ellen in a soothing tone, "and tell me what troubles you.
                     There is nothing so trying to a human soul as to be shut up in itself, and
                     struggle with its grief alone: therefore speak out, for I think that you can
                     trust me."</p>
                  <p>"I know I can, Ellen; and that is the reason why I now tell you a secret which
                     I had resolved no power on earth should wring from me. For the sake of position
                     and influence, I have married a man whom in my heart I despise; and now, when
                     the novelty of my situation is gone, and I begin to feel the worthlessness of
                     such things, my whole soul seeks in vain for that love and sympathy which I so
                     blindly sacrificed to my ambition. O Ellen, Ellen! it is a terrible thing to
                     live without love. One had better be in the depths of perdition with those
                     dearest to the heart than in the midst of paradise alone. A woman who dares
                     marry for aught else than the purest affection calls down the just judgment of
                     heaven upon her head."</p>
                  <p>"There is only one help for her in such a case," said Ellen meekly. "Let her
                     love those who should be next dearest; and surely, Mrs. Raynor, you can find
                     many to love, and who would gladly love you in return."</p>
                  <p>"True, Ellen, such a course might be a slight alleviation to my misery; but I
                     have so outraged my nature, that now the warmth of my affections can not find
                     expression either in looks or smiles, and I am obliged to<pb n="200-201"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000101"/> present a cold, repulsive exterior to those whom
                     I am most desirous to love. How often have I looked in Hesper's cheerful
                     countenance, and longed to clasp her to my heart! but I was afraid, lest she
                     should shrink from me, and that would have been one drop too much in my cup of
                     bitterness. Ellen, I know she loves your brother,—loves him with all the
                     sincere affection of a true-hearted woman. There is a wide difference between
                     their circumstances in life, but he is entirely worthy of her; and I would
                     sooner cut off my right hand than place the slightest hinderance in the way of
                     their happiness. If it is in my power, she, at least, shall know the enjoyment
                     of true love."</p>
                  <p>In an instant, wide open flew the bed-curtains; and Hesper, with extended arms,
                     sprang forward, clasping her astonished step-mother to her heart, and almost
                     smothering her with kisses. Mrs. Raynor burst into tears, and covered her face
                     with her hands.</p>
                  <p>"O Hesper!" she sobbed, "from you, more than from any other, have I endeavored
                     to keep my unhappiness a secret. But it is too late now. I can not take back my
                     words, and you know all Forgive me for my injustice to your father."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, you can not help it," said Hesper, kissing her again and again. "I
                     knew it long ago; but you more than make up for it by your good-will to his
                     daughter: so let us bury the hatchet from this time forth and for ever, and
                     then the only strife between us shall be which shall love the other most. We
                     will drop at once the idea of mother and daughter, and be to each other as true
                     friends."</p>
                  <p>Hesper took a seat, and the ladies talked with open hearts together, till the
                     old clock in the corner struck nine.</p>
                  <p>"We must go," said Mrs. Raynor. "Harry will return soon, and I would not like
                     he should find me here with such a sad face and swollen eyes."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no!" said Ellen: "he told me that he thought his business would detain him
                     until quite late; so pray do not be in haste."</p>
                  <p>She had scarcely spoken, however, when the sound of footsteps was heard. The
                     next moment, the door opened, and Harry made his appearance.</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" he said, "I am glad to find such a nice little party;" and then, stepping
                     aside to allow the gentleman behind him to enter, he continued, "Ellen, allow
                     me to introduce to you my old friend and schoolmate, Morris Ayer. I met him
                     quite unexpectedly; and, for the sake of talking over old times together, I
                     have persuaded him to pass the night with me. Miss Hesper Raynor, Mr. Ayer; and
                     the other lady I believe you had the pleasure of meeting this morning."</p>
                  <p>More searching and significant glances never passed from human eyes than from
                     those of Morris Ayer and Hesper Raynor, as they saluted each other for the
                     first, time. Both had their secret thoughts, and both made up their minds in
                     that moment as to their future course of conduct toward each other.</p>
                  <p>"We were just speaking about going," said Mrs. Raynor in a quiet tone, as she
                     drew her veil more closely over her face, and rose from her seat; "and, as it
                     is so late, I think they will be alarmed about us if we do not return soon:
                     therefore you will excuse us."</p>
                  <p>"Then allow us to accompany you," said Harry;<pb n="202-203"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000102"/> and, notwithstanding Mrs. Raynor's most earnest
                     protestations to the contrary, the gentlemen insisted upon performing the duty
                     of cavaliers.</p>
                  <p>As the little company stepped out from the shade of the larches into the clear
                     moonlight, Morris Ayer very politely offered his arm to Hesper, which she
                     readily accepted, and commenced a lively conversation, wherein she continued to
                     mingle so much wit, brilliancy, and good sense, that the young author was quite
                     taken by surprise. He exerted himself to the utmost; but Hesper continually
                     gained the advantage. Their friends before them were quite forgotten, nor was
                     it observed that Harry and Mrs. Raynor had taken the most direct way to
                     Laureldell, and were now quite out of sight.</p>
                  <p>"As it is such a delightful evening, my dear Miss Raynor," said Morris, "let me
                     beseech you to prolong the pleasure of this walk, by taking the path over the
                     hill yonder. In my wanderings, a few days since, I found a most delightful spot
                     in that direction. It was a large rock, near which was a rustic arbor of wild
                     locusts and grape-vines, formed in a semicircle, with a seat of raised turf. It
                     overlooked the pond; and from that point of view was afforded one of the most
                     delightful prospects that my eyes ever beheld."</p>
                  <p>"Let us go there by all means," said Hesper; "it is one of my favorite haunts:
                     and, moreover, there is a story connected with it which makes it still more
                     interesting."</p>
                  <p>"A story, indeed! Perhaps it would furnish a fine subject for the pen of an
                     author or poet."</p>
                  <p>"An author or poet should never hear it from my lips," replied Hesper. "I can't
                     bear literary people! I have a perfect horror of them, and avoid their company
                     as much as possible; for I am continually in the fear that I shall be put into
                     a story, or made the subject of a poem, which I should consider an unpardonable
                     insult, and neglect no opportunity to avenge it to the extent of my
                     ability."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, Miss Raynor, then I would not for all the world number myself among
                     that class of unfortunate people; for I should consider myself most unhappy to
                     incur the displeasure of a beautiful and accomplished lady like yourself."</p>
                  <p>"Just hear the Katy-did in the woods yonder!" said Hesper. "I wonder if the
                     foolish thing knows what it says. Perhaps it is like some people, who use words
                     without a thought of their meaning. Thank you for your compliment, Mr. Ayer.
                        <emph>Flattery</emph> is never pleasing to me; but <emph>such</emph> words,
                     from the lips of a gentleman of experience and judgment, <emph>like
                        yourself,</emph> should always be understood as they were intended."</p>
                  <p>Morris Ayer bit his lips in silence, and resolved to try another mode of
                     proceeding.</p>
                  <p>As they seated themselves upon the smooth grassy mound, Hesper removed her hat;
                     and the light of the full moon, falling upon her beautiful countenance, added a
                     new charm to its bewitching loveliness. Morris Ayer was not insensible to such
                     influences, and he gazed at her with an unaffected admiration. There was
                     perfect magic in the smile which parted her lips, revealing teeth of such snowy
                     whiteness; and there was such a beamy light in her large dark eyes as she
                     turned toward him, that he could only look at her in silence, and wonder that
                     God had made aught so surpassingly fair. Mentally<pb n="204-205"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000103"/> tally, he decided, that, if she had borne the
                     reputation of a flirt, it was because she had not as yet met with any one who
                     could fully understand and appreciate her; and he began seriously to consider
                     how he might commend himself to her, as being the only young man worthy of her
                     most sincere regard.</p>
                  <p>"Shall I tell you the story now?" said Hesper, with a sweet simplicity.</p>
                  <p>"If you please."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then," she commenced, "I suppose you have heard people talk of spiritual
                     attraction,—the power that draws two kindred souls together from the greatest
                     distances, and unites them by its mysterious influences for ever. Well, it was
                     said that thus two young people met one evening, who had never seen each other
                     before. In the course of a walk, they strolled away from their companions, and
                     came to this place, seating themselves upon this very mound where we sit now.
                     The young man had been a wanderer among many nations, and had trifled so long,
                     that he had almost lost his faith in human goodness; but here again it was
                     revived, and he found at last the living image of the beautiful ideal in his
                     soul. So, as they sat together in the clear moonlight, in this very place where
                     we sit now, and gazed into each other's eyes, they fell deeply in love with one
                     another, though they never met before, and had spoken very little
                     together."</p>
                  <p>How it happened that Morris Ayer held Hesper's delicate white hand clasped in
                     his own, he could not tell, neither did he care to rectify the mistake even
                     when he perceived it.</p>
                  <p>"Well," continued Hesper, "as they sat in this very place where we sit now,
                     with their hands clasped together, they talked of the past as though it were
                     all a dream, and of the future as if life were just commencing with them; and
                     here they promised that through all time their souls should be united, and they
                     would ever remain true to each other, though they had never met before, and had
                     spoken very little together. To some this might seem strange; but do you
                     believe in love at first sight, Mr. Ayer?"</p>
                  <p>"Never before to-night," replied Morris in a low tone; for he was becoming very
                     much absorbed. "I confess that I have had many theories upon the subject; but
                     all that I can say now, is, that we are dust."</p>
                  <p>"It is no use theorizing about love, Mr. Ayer."</p>
                  <p>"No, my dear Miss Raynor: when we least expect it, we are its victims. Your
                     story touches an answering chord in my heart; and although <emph>we</emph> meet
                     to-night for the first time, yet I feel that perhaps our experience may be the
                     same as those of whom you speak."</p>
                  <p>Hesper drooped her head till her ringlets rested upon his shoulder.</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" she whispered, "men of genius have such a ready command of language, that
                     they often say more than they mean, and deceive others as well as
                     themselves."</p>
                  <p>"Hesper," said Morris with much earnestness, "I am neither deceiving, nor am I
                     deceived. I have been much in the company of ladies; but never has the
                     beautiful ideal of my soul stood before me till now."</p>
                  <p>"Do you believe," said Hesper, half raising her head, and glancing timidly into
                     his eyes, "that you can sincerely love me upon so short an acquaintance?"</p>
                  <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6310-00000104"/>
                  <p>"I do," replied Morris, laying his hand upon his heart to add effect to his
                     words; "and, if that affection can only be returned, I shall be the happiest of
                     mortals."</p>
                  <p>With a merry laugh, Hesper threw back her ringlets, and looked him full in the
                     face.</p>
                  <p>"Then my story is done," said she. "Mr. Ayer, you must now class yourself among
                     my '<hi rend="i"/>disconsolate admirers,' in whose name you so gallantly
                     volunteered to punish me this morning. There's a nice place to drown yourself
                     off the rock yonder. Good-night!" and, before the astonished author could
                     recover himself, she had vanished from the arbor, and was already far on her
                     way down the hillside.</p>
                  <p>"Sold!" said Morris thoughtfully, as he thrust his hands into his pockets, and
                     stepped forward to the edge of the rock. "As for drowning myself, that is
                     altogether out of the question; but I really have half a mind to hang myself
                     for a fool. I wouldn't have believed it possible, though: no, I wouldn't." And,
                     indulging in a great variety of reflections, he pursued his way homeward.</p>
                  <p>The next morning, Hesper received the following note:—</p>

                              <p>"MY DEAR MISS RAYNOR,—After our interview of last evening, justice
                                 both to you and myself demands a slight explanation. Our mutual
                                 friend Harry has spoken to me freely concerning you, and I have now
                                 a fair understanding of your true position and character. Not being
                                 mindful of the fact that even hayricks may sometimes have ears, I
                                 spoke those unfortunate words in your hearing, for which such a
                                 weight of judgment has fallen upon me. I acknowledge the justice of
                                 my punishment; and if by such concessions, and resolutions of good
                                 for the future, I may secure to myself the friendship of a lady
                                 whom I both respect and esteem, I will promise never again to
                                 condemn a woman as a flirt until I am fully convinced of the

                  <p>THE elegantly furnished parlor of Laureldell shone with a perfect blaze of
                     light, and was crowded with all the representatives of wealth, beauty, fashion,
                     and genius which the town of C—and its neighborhood could afford. It was
                     evident that this was no ordinary entertainment. Mrs. Raynor's parties were
                     usually termed "elegant" by the young ladies; but doubtless this, in their
                     estimation, was "perfectly splendid," for a finer opportunity to display their
                     charms to so large a company of admirers was seldom afforded.</p>
                  <p>But Mrs. Raynor herself shone unrivaled as the star of the evening. Her face
                     was dazzlingly pale, and in her eyes there was a brilliancy almost bewildering
                     to those who beheld her. Her dress of white satin, heavily ornamented with rich
                     lace, and the jewels in her hair and upon her bosom, gave her an air of queenly
                     dignity; and she moved among her guests as though amid such scenes alone she
                     found her native element. Morris Ayer gazed<pb n="208-209"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000105"/> at her in silent astonishment, and asked himself
                     again and again if this could indeed be his once humble friend Gertrude
                     Carysford. He talked with her for a while, glided through the mazes of the
                     dance with her, and then retired to a quiet corner, where Hesper and Ellen
                     Anderson were conversing with a few choice friends.</p>
                  <p>In a little side-room sat Mr. Raynor, in his dressing-gown and slippers, at the
                     whist-table, with several fat old gentlemen, wearing most imposing ruffles to
                     their shirts, and the brightest of brass buttons upon their blue broadcloth
                     coats. Here they could sip their wine and puff their cigars, having a jolly
                     good time all to themselves, without particularly disturbing the rest of the
                     company. Nothing but a smoking hot supper could tempt them from their cozy
                     retreat, and here they returned again so soon as that most important part of
                     the evening's entertainment was concluded, and resumed once more their favorite
                     amusement; while the rest of the company, at the suggestion of Mrs. Raynor,
                     took a walk about the spacious grounds, which were brilliantly illuminated for
                     the occasion.</p>
                  <p>Morris Ayer very politely offered his arm to Mrs. Raynor herself. They wandered
                     on, not caring whither they turned their footsteps, until they came at last to
                     the top of a small eminence at some distance from the house. Here they paused
                     beneath a spreading oak, whose branches were hung with a great variety of
                     colored lights. Beneath them was the mansion, resembling some royal palace,
                     with its brilliantly illuminated windows: sounds of music, and the merry voices
                     of the guests, came to them from the extensive groves and gardens, while from a
                     neighboring hill a fine display of rockets and other fireworks was
                     exhibited.</p>
                  <p>"This seems to me like a scene in fairyland," said Morris. "I can hardly
                     believe but what I am dreaming, more especially when I think of my old friend
                     Gertrude Carysford, as the enchantress whose magical wand has called up such
                     wonders before my eyes."</p>
                  <p>"Times have greatly changed since we first became friends together," said Mrs.
                     Raynor.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," replied Morris; "and I rejoice that for you time has brought such happy
                     changes. Under the influence of such a lively, affectionate nature as Hesper's,
                     with a kind, indulgent husband, with all the pleasures and advantages that
                     wealth can afford, your life can not be otherwise than happy. I can see now, if
                     you will allow me to speak of the past, how utterly unable I should have been,
                     with my limited means, to place you in a situation which you adorn with so much
                     honor to yourself and satisfaction to others."</p>
                  <p>"Let us return," said Mrs. Raynor; and, as she placed her hand in the arm of
                     her companion once more, he felt that she trembled violently.</p>
                  <p>"Are you ill?" he asked, with some concern.</p>
                  <p>"No," she replied. "The night air is chill, and I am extremely sensitive to
                     cold."</p>
                  <p>As the guests were assembled in the parlor once more, Hesper hastened with a
                     glowing countenance to Mrs. Raynor; and, as she drew her aside, she
                     whispered,—</p>
                  <p>"Oh! I have a delightful piece of news to tell you. Morris Ayer and Ellen
                     Anderson are engaged. Harry has just told me. They made the agreement last
                     night, and are to be married in the course of a few months."</p>
                  <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6310-00000106"/>
                  <p>Mrs. Raynor only smiled and bowed; and Hesper found it impossible to understand
                     the singular expression of her countenance as she turned away. A few moments
                     after, the guests were startled by a wild hysterical laugh. Each one turned in
                     the direction from whence it proceeded, and perceived Mrs. Raynor leaning upon
                     a chair, and intently regarding the group at the whist-table, in the adjoining
                     room.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Raynor," she called out in a loud, excited tone, "what's trumps now?
                     hearts ought to be; but diamonds were when you took me, though I don't think
                     you won much by the game. Ha, ha, ha!"</p>
                  <p>"What the deuse is the matter with the woman?" said the astonished husband, as
                     he threw down his cards, and rose from his chair.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! you needn't stop for me," she continued. "Play away: you'll need another
                     wife before long; for I intend to quit this scene of action as soon as
                     possible. There's a plenty of women who can be bought for money."</p>
                  <p>"I'll bet she's crazy," said one of the fat gentlemen with broad ruffles and
                     brass buttons: and the same impression seemed to have spread throughout the
                     entire company; for the word was repeated in an undertone from lip to lip.</p>
                  <p>"Well, this is a pretty fix for a man to be in," said Mr. Raynor, as he thrust
                     his hands beneath his dressing-gown, and looked round with a bewildered
                     air,—"house full of company, and wife crazy. I say, Professor Love-land, what
                     the deuse is to be done?"</p>
                  <p>"I consider it only a slight nervous attack," said the professor gravely. "The
                     insanity is only temporary; and, if she retires at once to her room, doubtless
                     she will soon be better. I will ascertain first, though, if the attack be
                     accompanied by fever."</p>
                  <p>"You touch me at your peril," said Mrs. Raynor, as he advanced toward her: "I
                     am not yet ready for the dissecting knife, you greedy-eyed philosopher! Wait
                     till I am dead, which will not be long first; and then, if you lay the weight
                     of your finger upon me, I will haunt you like an evil spirit night and
                     day."</p>
                  <p>"Ellen, Ellen!" called out Hesper, as she sprang from her seat where she had
                     been sitting for the last few moments, dumb with astonishment. But no one
                     answered to her call. She rushed out upon the piazza, and the first person she
                     met was Morris Ayer. "Oh!" she exclaimed, "for heaven's sake come and see what
                     you can do with my step-mother! She is raving crazy, and I don't know what she
                     will say next. If it is a possible thing, make her go to her room."</p>
                  <p>With a firm step, Morris Ayer immediately crossed the room, and laid his hand
                     on Mrs. Raynor's arm. "Gertrude," he said, in a low tone, "will you go with
                     me?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," she whispered, as she fixed her eyes on his, "to the end of the world;"
                     and he immediately conducted her from the room.</p>

                  <p>THE next morning, the village gossips had as much as they could do to talk over
                     the singular occurrence at Laureldell of the night previous. Any thing further
                     than the actual circumstances as they happened could not be ascertained; for
                     although several of the most eager had been out to reconnoiter the premises,
                     yet the blinds were all closed, and no one was to be seen of whom inquiries
                     could be made. Some, even, had visited the cottage of Ellen Anderson; but the
                     door was locked, and no one at home.</p>
                  <p>Ellen was now the nurse of Mrs. Raynor; and, could some of those curious
                     inquirers have looked into that darkened upper chamber, they would have beheld
                     a scene never to be forgotten. Mrs. Raynor was in the wildest delirium of
                     fever, and only by the constant efforts of Ellen and Morris Ayer (the only two
                     whom she would allow to approach her (could she be restrained in her room.</p>
                  <p>Days and weeks passed by, and her recovery seemed doubtful; but at length the
                     fever yielded, and left her in a state of childlike weakness. It was a long
                     time, however, before she could leave her room and join the family-circle. One
                     who had formerly known her would scarce have recognized her now. In that
                     comparatively short period of sickness she seemed to have passed over many
                     years. Her eye had lost its brilliancy, and her step its lightness; and the
                     beautiful, long, dark hair, in which she had once taken so much pride, had
                     gradually fallen away, until now it could no longer be considered the crowning
                     ornament of her beauty. The truth was, that the days of Mrs. Raynor's glory had
                     departed; and, looking in her mirror, she smiled sadly as she said,—</p>
                  <p>"Hesper, I must now yield the palm to you. I shall no longer be your rival, but
                     henceforth I will shine in your light alone."</p>
                  <p>One evening, after Mr. Raynor had returned from the city, and was seated at the
                     back-parlor window, reading the paper, she stole quietly into the room, and,
                     clasping her arms about his neck, laid her cheek gently to his, as she
                     said,—</p>
                  <p>"Edward, I want to speak to you."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Raynor very dutifully laid down his paper, and waited to hear what she had
                     to say.</p>
                  <p>"Do you know," she commenced, "that Hesper would like to marry?"</p>
                  <p>"The deuse!" he exclaimed with interest and surprise: "you don't say so! Well,
                     why don't she?"</p>
                  <p>"Because she first desires your consent."</p>
                  <p>"Why, the foolish girl! she knows I won't object. But who is the fellow?"</p>
                  <p>"Harry Anderson."</p>
                  <p>"The dense!" exclaimed Mr. Raynor again, as he thrust both hands into his
                     pockets, and put on his most business-like expression. "I wasn't thinking of
                     that, though. It will never do in the world."</p>
                  <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6310-00000108"/>
                  <p>"He is an active, intelligent man," interposed Mrs. Raynor.</p>
                  <p>"Don't dispute that in the least; but, then, to think of my daughter marrying
                     my gardener, when she might have almost anybody she chose! Fie! don't speak of
                     it."</p>
                  <p>"Shall Hesper marry for love, or for money?" asked Mrs. Raynor.</p>
                  <p>"For both," he replied. "It is not an impossibility that she should find a rich
                     man who is worthy of her love."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Raynor laid her hand on her husband's arm, and looked him mildly in the
                     face.</p>
                  <p>"Edward," she said, "do you remember the confession that I made you with
                     weeping, the other day, when I opened my whole heart, and prayed you to help me
                     that I might become the true and faithful wife to you that I should have been
                     from the first? Say, now, will you condemn Hesper to live over my experience,
                     or will you do all that lies in the power of a true-hearted father to make her
                     happy?" and, as she finished speaking, once more she laid her pale cheek to
                     his, and gently kissed his lips.</p>
                  <p>"There, Gertrude," said Mr. Raynor, as he brushed his hand across his eyes,
                     "you have such a way of coming into my heart since you were sick, that I find
                     it impossible to deny you any thing. If the girl wanted to marry a Hottentot, I
                     should say yes, were you to ask me after that fashion. On the whole, Harry
                     Anderson really is a fine fellow, and, if marrying will make them both happy,
                     why I shall be the last person to say no: so run and tell the girl as soon as
                     possible. Stop, I'll go with you."</p>
                  <p>A few weeks after this there was a grand bridal party at Laureldell,—a double
                     wedding; for Morris Ayer had gladly accepted the invitation which Mrs. Raynor
                     had extended him, to make his chosen one his own beneath her roof.</p>
                  <p>As the last words were spoken which made Ellen Anderson the wife of Morris
                     Ayer, Mrs. Raynor clasped her pale hands together, and turned away. She leaned
                     her head against the window, and the tears streamed silently down her cheeks.
                     It was but for a few moments, however. She wiped away her tears; and, stepping
                     forward once more, she clasped the hands of the happy couple in her own, and
                     wished them all the happiness which love and the true union of hearts could
                     afford.</p>
                  <p>Her victory was complete. She had married Edward Raynor for the sake of
                     position and influence; but Morris Ayer had always held possession of her heart
                     from her girlhood. She had, however, paid the penalty with unwavering firmness,
                     and only God and her own heart knew the secret.</p>

                  <p>WE alone are changeless and eternal," said the Stars, as they looked down from
                     the celestial heights upon the warring winds and waves, and the changing scenes
                     of earth. "Ages on ages have passed, and here we burn in undimmed glory. Ages
                     on ages shall pass, and man, who vainly strives to read our mysteries, must lie
                     down in the silent grave; but we shall live for ever, for we alone are
                     eternal."</p>
                  <p>"You eternal!" shouted the Winds in derision, as the echo of the starry voices
                     came down from above: "You are but shining atoms upon the floor of heaven. The
                     angels shall tread you into dust beneath their footsteps, and we will scatter
                     you to the farthest ends of the universe. Go to, now, you boastful things! What
                     would you be without us? The shining garments which clothe you in beauty, the
                     blue fields of other, the fluent strata of pure airs in the interstellar
                     spaces, and the great whirlwinds which shroud you in clouds and darkness—are
                     all a part of us; and, should we once withdraw our viewless arms, you would
                     rush headlong down the gulf of time, and be scattered like shattered wrecks
                     upon the great ocean of eternity. Hold your peace now, or confess that we alone
                     are eternal!"</p>
                  <p>"The Stars may confess it; but <emph>I never will!</emph>" was thundered from
                     the bosom of the great deep in a tone of defiance. "You uphold the stars! It is
                     a lie, you fickle, changing thing, unworthy of a name! a viewless, formless,
                     placeless, treacherous fury! How often have you dallied with my waves, and laid
                     your head upon my bosom, beseeching me to love you! But away, you idle thing!
                     The time shall come when I will blot the stars from heaven, and crush you in
                     the very depths of darkness; for I alone am eternal."</p>
                  <p>"Ha! we will see!" shouted the Winds. "Now, out upon you!"</p>
                  <p>Then they burst forth like unchained furies, lashing the sea to foam; and wave
                     chased flying wave, till they broke, at last, upon a lonely and desolate shore.
                     There stood a gray old rock,<ref rend="super" target="#note_001"
                        xml:id="return_001">*</ref> lifting up its majestic front, crowned with oak,
                     and plumed with pine, looking down like a stately queen upon the tumult of the
                     waters.</p>

                  </note>
                  <p>"What now?" said the Rock,—"you who are always so quarrelsome! what new thing
                     has broken out between you?"</p>
                  <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6310-00000110"/>
                  <p>"Hear, hear!" cried the Winds and the Waves at once. "You shall be the judge
                     between us. We, the Stars, the Winds, and the Sea, have each claimed to be
                     eternal. Say, to which shall it fall?"</p>
                  <p>"You have all spoken falsely," said the Rock; "for I alone am eternal. Time and
                     change affect me not. The floods can not drown, fire can not burn, nor the
                     winds remove me. Here, in the lonely watches of the night, I have seen the
                     stars fall like lightning from heaven. Can such things be eternal?"</p>
                  <p>"But I"—exclaimed the impatient Winds.</p>
                  <p>"Silence! Until you take some solid form, and ground yourself in everlasting
                     strength, you can never be eternal; and not till the Ocean can break the chains
                     by which he is drawn hither and thither by the pale spirit above him can
                        <emph>he</emph> be eternal. Till then, bow down, and acknowledge me your
                     queen; for I alone am the same for ever and ever."</p>
                  <p>"Not we!" whispered the Winds. "Let us go, for the Rock is a hard mistress."
                     And away they fled, bearing with them the tempest-clouds, and letting in the
                     lovely light of the moon and stars upon the foamy waves.</p>
                  <p>"Better lost than won," said the Rock; "but what will the Ocean say for
                        <emph>himself?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"What can I say but what I have ever said?" replied the Ocean, as he knelt at
                     her feet, and clasped his long white arms around her. "Have I not always adored
                     you? When the roses of summer decked your brow, and the green vines waved
                     around, I sung my sweetest songs for you; and when Winter clasped you in his
                     cold embrace, and printed his frozen kisses on your cheeks, though I moaned
                     sadly, yet I did not forsake you. You, indeed, are eternal; but so also am I.
                     Is it not meet, then, that we should be united, and love each other through the
                     lapse of the eternal ages?"</p>
                  <p>"No, no! you are too stormy and too wild for me. The slightest thing will put
                     you in a passion; and yonder pale-faced lady in the skies can draw you
                     wheresoever she pleases."</p>
                  <p>"Very true," replied the Ocean with a sigh; "but how can you expect to find
                     perfection? I have my faults and failings, as, no doubt, have you; but still I
                     fondly dreamed that by my constant coming I might at length wear away your
                     heart of stone."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, yes!" replied the Rock. "My heart is, indeed, hard and cold; but yet I
                     have some feeling left. I have not been unmindful of your constancy. Seldom, if
                     ever, do I leave my home; and, were it not for you, I should be very lonely.
                     You have brought me shells, and necklaces of seaweed, and sprigs of coral, very
                     beautiful: bring me also the latest news each day, and I will never leave nor
                     forsake you."</p>
                  <p>"Mine, mine, through a long eternity!" exclaimed the Ocean; and once more he
                     clasped his foamy arms about her.</p>
                  <p>There was a tittering of Winds heard above and around, and all the Leaves of
                     the forest clapped their hands. "What nonsense!" they exclaimed: "the Rock is
                     the bride of the Sea! That is too good to last long!" And again they all
                     laughed together.</p>
                  <p>"What is that I hear?" said the Ocean.</p>
                  <p>"Nothing," replied the Rock, "but the silly Winds gossiping in the forest
                     above. Let them laugh while<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6310-00000111"/> they
                     may; for, ere long, the leaves will fall, and then we shall hear them howling
                     for a shelter. How vain and idle these fleeting things appear when compared
                     with our own eternity!"</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE GRAY-BEARDS.</head>
                  <p>IT was not many moons before the prophecy of the Rock was fulfilled. The Winds
                     were shrieking through leafless forests, heaping the winter snows, and roaring
                     in the tops of the pines and cedars, that looked down upon the stormy ocean, as
                     it beat with mournful wailings against the ice-bound rock.</p>
                  <p>"O God! Almighty God!" cried the Ocean, as he lifted up his voice to the gloomy
                     clouds, "is there nought eternal, save thyself? Is it because all things which
                     thou hast created must perish, that we are thus beated and driven about without
                     mercy?"</p>
                  <p>No sound was heard in answer to that cry. The winds raved on, the waters
                     roared, and the heavens grew darker; but, like a frightened sea-bird, over the
                     troubled waves came a little bark, freighted with precious human souls.</p>
                  <p>"Who are these? and why are they here?" cried the Rock to the Sea, as, borne
                     onward in their little shallop, they neared its icy sides.</p>
                  <p>"Truly," said the Ocean, "in form they resemble the children of the forest; but
                     their faces are white like the winter snows. May they not be the children of
                     the Almighty God?"</p>
                  <p>"If they are the children of God," replied the Rock, "they are eternal, and
                     will reign over us."</p>
                  <p>"We will see if they are eternal!" cried the Winds from above. "We will blow
                     our coldest blasts, and heap the snows upon them; and the children of the
                     forest shall smite them with their arrows. Now, out upon ye, Gray-beards! We
                     will not have ye among us!" Then the forest shook its leafless arms, and the
                     keen blast blew down the drifting snows upon them; but the strangers heeded it
                     not. They moored their little bark, and one by one they ascended the gray old
                     rock.</p>
                  <p>"Servants of God," said one, as he looked forward to the howling wilderness,
                     and back to the stormy ocean, "before you is God and freedom, and behind you
                     the world and slavery. Choose ye this day which ye will serve." And all with
                     one accord cried out, "God and freedom! Give us liberty or death!"</p>
                  <p>"Then, in the midst of this wilderness will we build up a kingdom to the Lord,
                     and his law shall be written on our hearts. The scepters of the world shall be
                     broken, and the nations scattered; but in his strength shall we abide for ever:
                     for liberty, like God, is eternal."</p>
                  <p>"Here, upon this rock," said a gray-haired old man, "will we build our church,
                     and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."</p>
                  <p>"And here, too," said a brave chieftain, as he drew his battle-blade, "by the
                     church founded upon this rock, will we plant the seed of liberty; and, guarded
                     as by the flaming sword of Eden, it shall grow into a great tree, and in its
                     shadow shall the oppressed of all nations find a refuge."</p>
                  <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6310-00000112"/>
                  <p>"We will have no trees here but of our own planting!" shouted the Winds; and
                     again they beat fiercely upon the exiles, driving them into the midst of the
                     wilderness. Here they kindled their fires, felled the forest-trees, and built
                     their cabins.</p>
                  <p>Keener still blew the bitter blast; the frowning heavens poured out their
                     stores of snow and hail; and the Ocean, as he leaped up by the old rock, looked
                     upon them with an angry countenance. In the midst of this darkness and
                     desolation, the light of many a lowly cabin went out. Sickness and death were
                     there; and when the warm sunshine and the gentle breezes melted the winter
                     snows, the graves of the exiles were more in number than their homes.</p>
                  <p>"Ha! what think you now?" cried the Winds to the Rock and the Sea. "Look at
                     these little heaps of earth! Are these the children of God? Are these
                     eternal?"</p>
                  <p>A few sweet Flowers, with blushing buds like the rosy tints of evening, had
                     bloomed upon a lowly grave; and, lifting up their tiny voices, they made
                     reply—</p>
                  <p>"Be still, O cruel Winds! for God, who is mindful of all things, careth also
                     for the sorrowing exiles. As I have been tenderly nursed in the bosom of the
                     earth, to bloom again upon this sacred spot, so will he raise them up from the
                     winter of their affliction, and scatter their seed all over this vast
                     wilderness."</p>
                  <p>A woman pale with suffering came near the grave to weep. She saw the flowers;
                     and, falling upon her knees, she watered them with the tears of her rapture.
                     Gathering a single cluster, she hastened back to the bereaved and sorrowing.
                     "See here!" she cried: "I went to weep over our loved ones; but I found the
                     flowers of hope blooming on the borders of the grave. Let us weep no longer,
                     but rejoice. God careth for the flowers; and are we not much better than
                     they?"</p>
                  <p>The years passed on, till men numbered them by centuries. Instead of the little
                     band of exiles in a howling wilderness was a mighty nation, spreading over hill
                     and vale, from sea to sea, and from the snow-clad mountains of the north to the
                     green savannas of the south. The fathers had laid down in the quiet earth to
                     rest; but out of their graves sprang wonderful trees, like that planted by the
                     rock of the sea; and, when their children had eaten of the fruit, they grew so
                     mighty that they burst the bonds of the oppressor, and became a nation of kings
                     and princes whose throne was in the earth, and whose scepter was over the sea.
                     The Ocean was driven back in his bed by the works of these children of
                     strength; and the Rock, weak with age, gathered her garments about her, and hid
                     her face in the dust.</p>

                  <p>FAR across the blue waves that visited this happy shore was another land, the
                     home of many nations. There might was more powerful than right; the strong
                     oppressed the weak; and from the morning till the evening sun the prayers of
                     the down-trodden and suffering went up to the Lord of Sabaoth. The brave<pb
                        n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6310-00000113"/> old fathers, the spirits of the
                     past, heard that cry, and they could not slumber in their graves.</p>
                  <p>"Father of all," they said, "what shall we do for these children of
                     sorrow?"</p>
                  <p>Then the angel of God pointed in silence to the tree that was planted by the
                     rock; and, lo! it was bending with the ripened fruit. So the fathers gathered
                     of the seed, and scattered them in every land.</p>
                  <p>There was a brave but suffering people, upon whom the hand of the oppressor was
                     heavy. The chilling winds of tyranny blew with a bitter breath upon the fertile
                     soil; but when the seed fell upon it, nurtured by the blood and tears of that
                     unhappy people, it sprung up vigorously, and seemed ready to yield an abundant
                     harvest.</p>
                  <p>When the tyrants saw it, they said one to another, "How is this? These are
                     shoots from the great tree beyond the ocean; and, if we suffer the fruit to
                     ripen, this people will become so mighty, that we can not oppress them, and our
                     gain is lost. Let us send in our reapers at once, to destroy it before the
                     harvest." So they came down, like wolves upon the fold, from their mountain
                     fastnesses and strongholds; and with their sharp sickles they cut down every
                     plant and shrub and blossoming tree, that would bear the precious fruit.</p>
                  <p>Then said the spirits of the past, "Father of all, what shall we do? The arm of
                     the oppressor is strong."</p>
                  <p>And the Lord answered, "The seed was sown early, ere the spring-time, and the
                     frosts have blighted it; but the fallen leaves shall fertilize the soil. Sow ye
                     the seed again, and wait patiently; for seed-time and harvest shall not
                     fail."</p>
                  <p>So the fathers went forth once more; and by chance, as they sowed, a precious
                     grain fell into the bosom of a brave son of this people.<ref rend="super"

                      He felt it warming and kindling into life upon his heart, like fire
                     from the altar of God. The people knew it, and were glad, and chose him for
                     their prophet; but the tyrants gnashed their teeth, and thirsted for his blood.
                     Hunted like a wild beast, and pursued by these cruel and relentless spirits, he
                     clasped his arms about the healthful plant in his bosom, as if it were a loved
                     child, and fled, he scarce knew whither. But the moon, like a pale
                        crescent,<ref rend="super" target="#note_003" xml:id="return_003">†</ref>
                      looked kindly from the sky, and called him into her enchanted realm.
                     Here she shut him in a prison, dark and strong, where the hand of the enemy
                     could not reach him.</p>

                  <p>"Let us not forsake him," said the spirits of the past. So they visited him in
                     prison, and anointed him with the oil of strength, and spake words of heavenly
                     wisdom, and gave him a tongue of fire, such as came to the apostles on the day

                  <p>But the plant in his bosom began to droop for want of the free air and light;
                     and the heart of the prophet was sad within him. Then the crescent moon looked
                     into his prison, and said, "Forget thy God, and worship me, and I will save
                     thee from thine enemies."<ref rend="super" target="#note_004"

                     prison-doors, and he went forth free. A wondrous bird, with a shining circlet
                     of stars about his head,<ref rend="super" target="#note_005"

                      waited to bear him on his snowy wings across the ocean to the land of
                     peace; and, as he gazed in wonder at this strange friend, the Stars cried to
                     him, "Follow us, and we will guide you to the place where this young child of
                     freedom lies." Before him, friendly voices were calling him to come; and behind
                     him, like ghouls and raging furies, his enemies were on his track. Away, away,
                     he fled, over the foamy waves, and looked not back, save when the sobs and
                     moans that followed him called up sad memories of his fatherland.</p>

                     rejoicings, and martial music, and pealing shouts of welcome. Yet still, above
                     them all, he heard the sobs and moans and the dear voices of his fatherland. He
                     saw this people, with their churches and their schools, their hospitals,
                     asylums, and their courts of justice, their harvest-fields, and orchards; he
                     laid his hand upon their hearts, and felt them throbbing with the happy
                     consciousness of peace and plenty; he looked into their eyes, and saw them
                     glowing with the deep enthusiasm of an earnest faith in God and man: and then
                     his heart had well-nigh failed him; for his own dear land—so worthy, yet so
                     wanting—seemed to have lost its Maker's smile before this favorite of his grace
                     and goodness. The plant within his bosom struck its roots deep in his heart. It
                     drank the lifeblood from his veins, and gathered up the fountains of his
                     strength. So at times his hands grew weary, and his heart was faint. At length
                     he sought the threshold of this mighty nation, and stood upon the rock where
                     first the pilgrim-exiles raised their prayers to God. His soul had grown
                     familiar with the story of their toil and sorrow; and now he saw the fruits of
                     all their weary labors stretching out before him, like a fertile field fast
                     ripening for the harvest.</p>
                  <p>"O God!" he cried, "is there no ray of hope for my poor bleeding
                     fatherland?"</p>
                  <p>Then the spirits of the past bowed down from the clouds, that wept tears of
                     holy consolation upon him, and their answer came like refreshing rain to his
                     drooping hopes,—"Be patient and be strong. The God of the pilgrim-exiles yet
                     liveth; and the tree of Liberty planted by this rock shall fill the earth, and
                     all the nations shall rest in peace beneath the shadow. The stars may fall from
                     heaven, the ocean vanish away, and the rocks hide themselves in the dust; but
                     the love of God is eternal, and endureth for ever."</p>
                  <p>Then, with firmer step and holier faith, he went his way. None but the angels
                     who unseal the great book of destiny can read therein the eventful future; but
                     the heart of man need not fail him, for the arm of the Lord is strong, and his
                     love is changeless as his own eternity.</p>
                  <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6310-00000115"/>
                  <p>The dust of centuries lies on the gray old Pilgrim Rock, and only careful eyes
                     and earnest hands can find the sacred spot; and the Ocean, driven back by the
                     hand of man, has lost his early love for ever. But, as the pilgrims' graves
                     grow green, so, in the hearts of their children's children, the memory of their
                     deeds grows greener; and, like a monument of strength by the sea of time, each
                     generation lays another stone upon their work, so patiently begun, building it
                     up nearer to the Infinite of God, till it shall stand like a great pillar in
                     his temple, <emph>eternal</emph> and sublime.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                  <head type="sub">MR. SILVERBURY PROPOSES TO REFORM THE WORLD.</head>
                  <p>IT was very evident that Lorenzo Woodruff, the junior partner of the firm of
                     Goldthwaite &amp; Woodruff, was in great haste; yet, nevertheless, an
                     insuperable barrier was placed in his way, in the person of a fashionable lady,
                     whose amplitude of skirts and flounces quite monopolized the narrow sidewalk,
                     and left no alternative for the followers in her rear, except of rushing
                     recklessly past her, or of stepping ankle-deep in the mud which filled the
                     gutters. Lorenzo Woodruff glanced impatiently to the right and left, and then
                     made a desperate rush; but, unfortunately for the success of his movement, a
                     button upon his coat seized fast hold on the rich fringe of her mantilla, and
                     obliged them both to perform sundry evolutions highly amusing to the old
                     apple-woman at the corner. In the utmost confusion, he turned to apologize,
                     when, to his inexpressible relief, he recognized in the person of the lady the
                     beautiful daughter of his partner, Miss Nelly Goldthwaite. The look of
                        indignation<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6310-00000116"/> which at first
                     disturbed her faultless features was changed at once to a smile, and she
                     greeted him with a pleasant "Good-morning."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, Miss Nelly," he said, slackening his pace for a moment, "you must
                     excuse my haste and rudeness, for my mind was wholly absorbed in business. I
                     see, by the morning papers, that 'The Clara Jane,' which we had about given up
                     as lost, has arrived at New York, and I expect letters by this mail."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I am so glad!" returned the fair lady, in the sweetest tone imaginable;
                     "for now I do hope that father will allow me to have that rich bracelet I have
                     been longing for, but which he declared I should not purchase until he heard
                     from 'The Clara Jane.' Well, that <emph>is</emph> good news, Mr. Woodruff, and
                     I freely forgive you for putting me out of sorts."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Woodruff smiled and nodded, and was about to quicken his pace once more,
                     when he was immediately seized in a most unceremonious manner by the skirts of
                     his coat from behind; and a loud, cheery voice called out directly in his
                     ear,—</p>
                  <p>"Thank goodness, I have you at last, Woodruff! I've been after you for these
                     last five minutes, and don't believe I should have overtaken you at all if it
                     hadn't been for this lady."</p>
                  <p>Miss Nelly turned a scrutinizing glance upon the speaker, whose threadbare coat
                     and rusty beaver did not speak much in his favor, and would have condemned him
                     at once in her opinion, had not his animated countenance, lit up by a very
                     handsome pair of eyes, been turned with an admiring gaze toward her. She bowed
                     slightly as Mr. Woodruff introduced his friend Silverbury bury, and then turned
                     immediately aside into the store of a fashionable jeweler.</p>
                  <p>"Woodruff!" exclaimed Silverbury, as he seized his friend by the arm with a
                     tragic air, "if there is any thing in the world that entirely upsets my
                     philosophy, and makes a complete simpleton of me, it is the face of a handsome
                     lady. But just now, I had a most splendid idea in my head, and came after you
                     like an express-train to astonish your ears with its utterance, when, at the
                     sight of those rosy lips and violet eyes, it vanished at once into the regions
                     of nowhere. But never mind," he continued, as he tightened his clasp upon
                     Woodruff's arm, "just come round the corner of the street here, out of the
                     crowd, and you shall have it yet."</p>
                  <p>"Not now, for goodness' sake! some other time!" remonstrated Woodruff, as
                     hevainly endeavored to free himself from that determined grasp. "I tell you I
                     am in a deuced hurry."</p>
                  <p>"Well, but it is worth your while," persisted Silver-bury. "I tell you it is
                     the most splendid idea I ever had in my life, as you yourself will confess if
                     you only allow me time to bring it out in the right shape."</p>
                  <p>"Impossible for me to stop five minutes!" said Woodruff. "Let me off now, and I
                     pledge you my word of honor I will hear you at another time."</p>
                  <p>"Another time is very indefinite," replied his persecutor; "and the homely old
                     saying is true, that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush! But what in
                     the world is all this hurry about?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, you see, 'The Clara Jane' has arrived from the West Indies with a cargo
                     of rum, molasses, and sugar. These commodities command a high price
                        now-a-days<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6310-00000117"/> a-days, and the sooner
                     they are in the market the better."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes, Woodruff: I know the price of all sweets are up in these degenerate
                     times, except the sweets of social intercourse, which are as cheap, as coarse,
                     and as common as ever; and that brings me directly back to my idea."</p>
                  <p>As he spoke, through an artful movement, accompanied by the look of hopeful
                     promise with which he usually succeeded in entrapping his listeners, Silverbury
                     drew his friend around the corner.</p>
                  <p>"Well, go on," said Woodruff, with the look of a martyr: "only be quick as
                     possible."</p>
                  <p>"Certainly! but I must begin at the beginning. You know I have been trying all
                     my lifetime to do or be something, but haven't succeeded as yet."</p>
                  <p>"That's a fact," said his friend significantly.</p>
                  <p>"Now, don't be sarcastic, Woodruff. You shouldn't have answered at all. The
                     subject didn't require it. But, as I was saying, although I have never
                     accomplished any thing heretofore, yet I am sure of something now. All the
                     knowledge which I have been so long in acquiring, all my past experience in
                     life, is now culminating to one point; and, in the end, you shall see that you
                     have no reason to be ashamed of your friend Silverbury. I shall only need a
                     little friendly assistance, just a word of recommendation, and perhaps a dollar
                     or two to help me along till I can bring my project to fulfillment."</p>
                  <p>"Well, what is it?" said Woodruff hurriedly, for his thoughts were still busy
                     with "The Clara Jane."</p>
                  <p>"Don't mention it, Woodruff; but I'm writing a lecture ture, and
                        <emph>such</emph> a lecture! I know I shall bring down all the newspapers in
                     the land upon me; but I will risk the result. I have put my armor on, and
                     intend to charge full tilt upon the great mammoth sin of the world in general
                     and Americans in particular. Yes, Lorenzo Woodruff, my lecture is entitled "A
                     Dollar or Two; or, The Extent and Evils of American Avarice;" and, if it
                     doesn't raise as great a commotion in the world as the doctrines of Martin
                     Luther himself, then I am wonderfully mistaken. Men will shudder to have their
                     cupidity, meanness, and duplicity exposed to view; yet I shall do it with a
                     steady hand, for the world needs reformation in this particular more than in
                     any other. A man will work night and day for a dollar or two; sacrifice the
                     nearest and tenderest relations; ruin his own health,—yes! and sell himself,
                     soul and body, to Satan, all for the sake of a dollar or two. Oh, this cursed
                     love of gain! how it blights and blemishes all that is beautiful and lovely in
                     the earth!"</p>
                  <p>"Stop! stop!" cried Woodruff entreatingly: "I have no doubt you will make a
                     good lecture of it, but don't give it to me now. I am somewhat sensitive on
                     that point."</p>
                  <p>"I know it, Woodruff; and you need salutary reproof as much as a rebellious
                     child needs correction: therefore I feel bound to administer it. Allow me
                     first, though, to define my position. I claim, that, as the love of money is
                     the root of all evil, so I can destroy the whole of this great moral upas which
                     now overshadows society by striking a deadly blow at its roots. The lecture
                     season is fast approaching: and there will be an innumerable host of
                     honorables, professors, reverends, and<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6310-00000118"
                     /> doctors in the field, who will thunder harmlessly <emph>over the
                        heads</emph> of the audience; but I intend to thunder directly <emph>into
                        their pockets.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"And lighten them, perhaps, of a dollar or two," remarked Woodruff dryly.</p>
                  <p>"Why, yes, Lorenzo: that's an important part of the play. And suppose a dollar
                     or two <emph>should</emph> exchange owners: what then? Why, the brisker the
                     circulation the brighter the coin; and, between you and I, a man can't do
                     without it."</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" said Woodruff significantly.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," replied his friend.</p>
                  <p>Silverbury thrust his hand into his pocket, and slowly drew forth a time-worn
                     port-monnaie. He opened it, and, with a sigh, displayed the contents, which
                     consisted of five tarnished coppers, two of which were outlawed from American
                     currency, on account of one bearing for a device a Scotch thistle, and the
                     other a very correct representation of a certain animal world-renowned for
                     stubbornness and stupidity.</p>
                  <p>"There," he said, "that is the extent of my wealth, and it is yet two months
                     more before the lecture-season commences. I am quite certain of success in my
                     undertaking, but what I shall do until then is a mystery. I might, indeed, go
                     to pegging shoes with old Fairlee; or sell yarn for Mrs. Bluethorpe; or, worst
                     of all, write miscellaneous articles for some newspaper. But no! not thus will
                     I debase my intellect for the sake of a dollar or two, or sell my birthright of
                     high and independent thought for a mess of pottage. The world has bowed down to
                     Mammon long enough, and I shall do all that lies in my power to save her from
                     further idolatry.</p>
                  <p>"Nevertheless, my good friend," continued Silverbury, with a very winning look,
                     "a man must live; and if I could only have a dollar or two, just a dollar or
                     two, until then, I should do finely. You understand, Woodruff? I know I'm over
                     head and ears in debt to you already: but, as I said, just a dollar or two more
                     will make but little difference; and I can easily pay all up so soon as I can
                     bring my lecture into the field."</p>
                  <p>"All right," replied Woodruff, as he drew his wallet from his pocket without
                     hesitation, and extracted from it a five-dollar bill. "I know you, Silverbury,
                     to be a smart fellow, though you are not generally appreciated. As I said
                     before, you haven't done any thing wonderful as yet in the world: yet I am
                     expecting every day that you will, for you certainly have the talent for it.
                     Therefore, take this for the present; and, when I am more at leisure, I will
                     see what else I can do for you."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you! thank you, my most beloved friend!" exclaimed Silverbury with great
                     earnestness, as he seized Woodruff's hand and the bill at the same time. "Oh!
                     if it hadn't been for you, I should have died of despair long ago; but you
                     shall yet be rewarded, and at the same time be proud of your friend Silverbury.
                     I believe I have said all I want to, and I need only add that I hope you will
                     dispose of 'The Clara Jane's' cargo to the best advantage."</p>
                  <p>Woodruff touched his hat, and the next moment was far on his way toward the
                     post-office, while Silverbury sauntered leisurely homeward, to prepare his
                     dinner and another paragraph in his proposed lecture.</p>
                  <p>The house where Mr. Silverbury kept bachelor's hall was owned by a very
                     singular old widow lady, known<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6310-00000119"/> as
                     Mrs. Bluethorpe, who, with her adopted daughter, Eva Leslie, occupied the first
                     floor. Mrs. Bluethorpe was an Englishwoman, and clung tenaciously to the forms
                     and fashions of the past. Despite the invasions which modern machinery had made
                     upon female labor, she still continued to card her wool, which she received
                     from the farm of her brother in the country, and convert it into yarn, which,
                     on account of its durability, and superiority to that produced by machinery,
                     always commanded a few cents more than any other in the market. Moreover, she
                     and the quiet little Eva employed themselves very busily evenings in converting
                     much of this yarn into stockings and mittens, which brought them many an honest
                     penny, and amounted to quite a handsome sum at the end of the year.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Bluethorpe abhorred an idler above all things; and though she had
                     pronounced Mr. Silverbury as such without hesitation, yet, by the same
                     unaccountable magnetic attraction which he seemed to exercise upon all who came
                     within his influence, he had won her favor also, of which she had given
                     convincing proofs in the shape of several pairs of stockings, which even a
                     grand duke might have taken comfort in wearing.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if a button or string was missing, or unseemly rips and rents
                     disfigured his garments, Mr. Silverbury appealed to the fair Eva with such a
                     winning look and smile that she could never find it in her heart to refuse him.
                     And then he would sit beside her as she sewed, gazing into the depths of her
                     clear blue eyes, scanning the smooth, peculiar swell of her fair forehead, and
                     the wavy outline of her auburn hair which rested in the most bewitching
                     ringlets upon her glowing cheeks, until he quite forgot his poverty, and became
                     the proprietor <foreign xml:lang="LAT">pro tem.</foreign> of a most magnificent
                     castle in the air, of which she was the presiding genius,—his "Angel in the
                     House." Yet Mr. Silverbury was a careful soul. He never committed himself by
                     word; for he very prudently thought, that, under different circumstances, he
                     should feel differently.</p>
                  <p>As we have already said, Mrs. Bluethorpe occupied the first floor of her
                     dwelling; Mr. Silverbury a front chamber alone on the second; while the
                     remaining rooms were let to a very peaceable, well-behaved German family. Above
                     them all, up in the third story, dwelt old Joseph Fairlee, a shoemaker, with
                     his invalid wife and his daughter Eugenia (better known as Genie), a young
                     woman about eighteen years of age, who kept house and bound shoes for her
                     father. Mr. Fairlee's parlor was his workshop; and there he sat and hammered
                     away most industriously from morning till night.</p>
                  <p>When Mr. Silverbury covenanted with Mrs. Bluethorpe for lodgings beneath her
                     roof, he inquired very particularly if among her tenants there were any amateur
                     performers on the flute or violin; and, being assured to the contrary, he took
                     up his abode there quite contentedly. But he soon found, that, between the tap
                     of old Fairlee's hammer and the buzz of Mrs. Bluethorpe's spinning-wheel, when
                     both were in operation, he could be nearly driven to distraction.</p>
                  <p>Thus was it upon this particular day, when he ran up the stairs to his room,
                     and seized his pen to take note of an idea which occurred to him just as he
                     came down the street. Buzz, buzz, tap, tap; what a confusion! As the saying
                     goes, he could "scarce hear his own ears."</p>
                  <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6310-00000120"/>
                  <p>"The American eagle," he commenced, "the glorious American eagle has been torn
                     from his transcendent height among the stars and stripes of our national flag,
                     to be ignobly stamped upon paltry coin,—snatched at by the greedy hand of
                     avarice, and associated forever with dimes and dollars in the calculations of
                     sordid souls."</p>
                  <p>"That is splendid!" said Silverbury, as he read it again. "Now, I'll just
                     attend to my dinner, and then write a little more; for by that time perhaps
                     this confounded racket will have ceased."</p>
                  <p>Two parsnips and a few slices of salt pork were the sole eatables of which Mr.
                     Silverbury's cupboard could boast. Nevertheless, he set himself to work to make
                     the most he could of these; and, after the cooking was fully under way, he
                     returned once more to his writing. It was quite impossible, however, to pursue
                     any connected train of thought with such a whizzing and clapping in his ears.
                     He thrust his fingers through his hair in vain, and tormented his brains till
                     he was almost frantic. A very pungent odor, however, saluting his nostrils,
                     recalled him to the consideration of earthly things; and upon examining the
                     stew-pan, the contents of which he had left simmering upon the stove, he found
                     the water had disappeared, and the remaining condiments were burned nearly to a
                     cinder. "Alas!" he said with a sigh, "that proves how impossible it is to live
                     both in the actual and the ideal! Well, I have lost my dinner; yet,
                     nevertheless, when my lecture is finished and the proceeds in my hands, I will
                     live like a king."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Silverbury was very hungry; yet he summoned up all his philosophy, and was
                     about to return to his writing, when there came a light tap at the door. He
                     opened it, and there stood Genie Fairlee with a bowl of smoking hot soup.</p>
                  <p>"Here," she said, in her usual straight-forward manner, "we have more than
                     enough for ourselves, and so father sent this to you: hope you'll like it, for
                     I did my best in making it."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Silverbury bowed most graciously as he received her favor with repeated
                     thanks. His esteem for Genie Fairlee was very great; although he dreaded her
                     plain, matter-of-fact way of speaking, and he thought her very homely. She was
                     uncommonly tall for a woman, with large gray eyes and dark brown hair, which,
                     although it was always arranged neatly, never received any coquettish touches.
                     In fact, she was a useful, true-hearted woman, gifted with an extraordinary
                     degree of common sense, which did not please Mr. Silverbury, as he was a poet,
                     and often said and did ridiculous things,—as poets are apt to do,—which people
                     of common sense consider very foolish. Nevertheless, he placed the greatest
                     confidence in her judgment, and seldom undertook any thing without first
                     consulting her.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Miss Genie!" he said, "you have come at exactly the right time. I have
                     written a most splendid passage, and want to read it to you: pray come in."</p>
                  <p>"Well, you must be quick," she said, as she seated herself upon the corner of a
                     chair, "for I have a <emph>heap</emph> of shoes to do before night."</p>
                  <p>"Look here," continued Silverbury, as he gathered up numberless scraps of paper
                     of all sizes, shapes, and colors, "all that written."</p>
                  <p>"Well, what is it all about?" said Genie.</p>
                  <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6310-00000121"/>
                  <p>"About!" repeated Silverbury in surprise. "Why, it's my lecture, entitled 'A
                     Dollar or Two;' being a grand <foreign xml:lang="FRA">exposé</foreign> of
                     American avarice: don't you remember? And here is what I was looking for."
                     There upon Mr. Silverbury proceeded to read the last triumphant effort of his
                     pen.</p>
                  <p>"There," he added in conclusion, as he nodded to her across the table, "what do
                     you think of that?"</p>
                  <p>"Well," she said, after some thoughtful hesitation, "at first it sounds like
                     something pretty bright; but, when you think about it, it seems gassy."</p>
                  <p>"Hum—,"said Silverbury.</p>
                  <p>"Well, don't you know," she continued with the greatest coolness, "that all
                     young lecturers talk largely about the 'American eagle and star-spangled
                     banner; just as Fourth-of-July orators do about 'our glorious Union,' and
                     visitors at Plymouth Rock about the 'Pilgrim exiles?' Now, I would leave that
                     out entirely; and, in its place, I would write something about the manner in
                     which rich and prosperous employers grind the faces of the poor; and mention
                     editors and publishers in particular, who thank contributors for articles which
                     put a dollar or two in their own pockets, while the poor souls who wrote them
                     have to satisfy themselves with empty fame."</p>
                  <p>She looked mischievous as she said this, for she knew that Mr. Silverbury had
                     been victimized several times in this very way. She had touched an answering
                     chord, however, for he seized his pen immediately.</p>
                  <p>"I will have <emph>both</emph> ideas," he said.</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, seriously," she replied, as she rose from her seat, "I wouldn't
                     have either. I wouldn't write any lecture at all; for I don't believe that it
                     will ever be good for any thing. What I mean is, that the ungrateful world will
                     not appreciate your efforts for its reformation, and will give you few thanks
                     and less money for your pains." She stood holding the door open, and looking
                     back at him as she continued, "If I were in your place, I would go into the
                     country, and help some farmer harvest his produce. It will be better for your
                     health and your pocket; and the satisfaction of <emph>earning</emph> a dollar
                     or two by honest labor is one of the sweetest things in existence. Good-day,
                     Mr. Silverbury.</p>
                  <p>"What an ordinary piece of earthenware that girl is!" he muttered to himself as
                     he listened to her step ascending the stairs. "No more imagination than an
                     owl!" and, after giving this slight expression to his indignation, he continued
                     his writing.</p>

                  <head type="sub">MR. SILVERBURY CHANGES THE SCENE, AND LABORS UNDER A
                     MISTAKE.</head>
                  <p>LONG-CONTINUED mental labor is far more exhaustive than physical; and thus Mr.
                     Silverbury found it, when, at the close of the day, he laid aside his pen, and,
                     seating himself at the window, leaned his head against the sash. He had no
                     appetite for his supper; and, moreover, was at variance with himself and all
                     the world. As he looked out into the street, and saw the people<pb n="242-243"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000122"/> returning home from their labor, he wondered if
                     there was any one in the world so lonely, so sorrowful, and unfortunate as he.
                     An old countryman, seated upon a rough board in his team, was whistling a
                     psalm-tune, as his oxen moved leisurely along the street. He had exchanged his
                     produce for groceries, and was now returning to a happy home and cheerful
                     fireside.</p>
                  <p>"There!" exclaimed Silverbury with much bitterness, "of what use are all my
                     aspirations and attainments, when this poor, unlettered man enjoys so much more
                     of health, wealth, and happiness than I? Oh, heavens! why was I born with a
                     mind so far above my condition?"</p>
                  <p>The countryman passed on; and Mr. Silverbury looked over to the apothecary's
                     shop opposite, where they were just lighting the lamps, and wondered whether
                     arsenic, opium, or strychnine would end his misery most promptly. As he sat
                     thus, indulging in these dismal reflections, a hasty step was heard on the
                     stairs, and the next moment the door was thrown open by his friend
                     Woodruff.</p>
                  <p>"Where are you, Silverbury?" he said, as he glanced around the room in the
                     darkness. "Oh, I see! got a message for you. Miss Nelly Goldthwaite sends her
                     compliments, and hopes to have the pleasure of seeing you at her <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">soirée</foreign> this evening."</p>
                  <p>"Me!" said Silverbury.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, you. Now, don't say you can't go, or that you won't, for I am determined
                     upon it. Your light has been under a bushel long enough; and now I want you to
                     display it to the world. Say yes at once, my good fellow, and I will call for
                     you a little after eight."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said Silverbury, "I will, though there is nothing I detest so much as
                     being patronized; and, if I meet with any thing of the kind from these
                     purse-proud aristocrats, I will show them directly that Solomon Silverbury
                     knows what true independence is."</p>
                  <p>"Poh!" said Woodruff: "make yourself look as well as possible, and the ladies
                     will all fall in love with you, without stopping to think whether you have ten
                     dimes or ten dollars in your pocket."</p>
                  <p>Thus saying, he closed the door and ran down stairs, leaving his friend to make
                     the necessary preparations.</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Silverbury, "this world is all a fleeting show; and as I am
                     obliged, perforce, to become an actor upon its stage, I will do the best I
                     can."</p>
                  <p>He found, upon examination, that his best black suit, although rather
                     threadbare, would do tolerably well for the evening; but his vest was worn to
                     tatters. He hesitated about purchasing a new one; but, upon the consideration
                     presenting itself to his mind that he should need it when he commenced his
                     lecturing career, he sallied forth immediately to the nearest ready-made
                     clothing establishment, and supplied himself with as good a one as his means
                     would allow. He also purchased a handkerchief and a pair of gloves, which he
                     considered indispensable. The bill which his friend loaned him in the morning
                     precisely covered the amount of these articles; and thus he found himself
                     reduced to his five coppers once more.</p>
                  <p>Yet of this most deplorable fact he became wholly forgetful, when, a few hours
                     after, he found himself standing in Horace Goldthwaite's parlor, with the
                     charming Nelly leaning on his arm, ready for a waltz.<pb n="244-245"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000123"/> He glanced at the mirror opposite, and saw, to
                     his satisfaction, that a very fine-looking couple was reflected there. Then the
                     music sounded, and away they went in a most bewildering whirl.</p>
                  <p>This was Mr. Silverbury's first appearance among the upper circles, although he
                     had been known for some time as a young man of fine talents and uncommon
                     intellectual endowments. And this was true of him; his main want being that of
                     sober common sense, which is not gained from books, but from daily experience
                     alone. This evening he felt himself to be under inspiring influences. The five
                     paltry coppers in his pocket did not weigh heavily upon his heart at all. He
                     moved as if in his native element, and therefore appeared to the best
                     advantage. Miss Nelly had a generous heart, and was willing to play his
                     patroness; while Silverbury was so bewitched by her dazzling beauty, that he
                     forgot to maintain his independence as he had resolved.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Nelly was a famous coquette, and could not possibly resist the
                     temptation of bringing every one under her influence. Mr. Silverbury was a new
                     conquest, and also served as a rod of terror to her old admirers, who looked on
                     with jealous eyes as they twirled their mustaches and shook their perfumed
                     handkerchiefs, wondering how far the fellow would carry his impudence. This did
                     not escape the observation of the fair lady, and therefore Mr. Silverbury was
                     overwhelmed with attention and favor; and he, in return, so great was the
                     transition from his little poverty-stricken room to this bewildering scene, was
                     perfectly intoxicated with delight. He danced, and laughed, and promenaded arm
                     in arm with the fair Nelly, entirely forgetful of his former self, and feeling
                     as if he were the possessor of millions.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Silverbury, how do you enjoy yourself?" said his friend Woodruff, at a
                     late hour, as he found him leaning against the wall in the refreshment-room,
                     leisurely disposing of a glass of ice-cream.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Woodruff!" he replied, "I feel as if in Paradise among the Peri, sipping
                     the nectar of the gods. Oh, I tell you, this is too much for me!" he continued,
                     as he took another spoonful of the cream.</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Woodruff, mistaking his meaning, "you aren't obliged to eat it
                     all."</p>
                  <p>Silverbury gave him a despairing look, but was saved from a reply by the
                     appearance of Miss Nelly, who begged him not to absent himself from the company
                     any longer, as they were about to take their places for a military cotillon,
                     and he should, if he pleased, lead the march with her. Down went his glass in a
                     moment; and, drawing her hand within his arm, he conducted her at once to the
                     place of honor.</p>
                  <p>One could easily have mistaken Mr. Silverbury for some foreign nobleman or
                     prince in disguise, with such a stately step did he keep time to the music. Mr.
                     Christopher Ridley, one of Nelly's most aristocratic admirers, leaned against
                     an exquisitely-chiseled Apollo, and looked on with a jealous eye. At every turn
                     in the march, when the triumphant couple passed him, Nelly would give an extra
                     flourish to her fan, and look up in her partner's face with an expression that
                     made Ridley almost crazy; and he grimly resolved, that, if any reasonable
                     excuse could be found, he would send the fellow a challenge next day. Not with
                     the expectation, however<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6310-00000124"/> ever, that
                     Silverbury would accept it; for Ridley never fired a pistol in his life, and
                     the very smell of powder made him nervous. Yet Silverbury, wholly unconscious
                     of his murderous intentions, passed on as happy as a king; although, now and
                     then, a dull click in his side pocket informed him that the five coppers lay in
                     an uncomfortable position.</p>
                  <p>At length the grand performance was ended, and people began to take leave. As a
                     parting favor, the mischievous Nelly presented Mr. Silverbury with a cluster of
                     moss-rosebuds which she had worn in her hair; and, with the pressing invitation
                     to call often now he had found the way, she allowed him to depart, at the same
                     time turning quickly aside to conceal a smile, excited by the exceedingly
                     crabbed expression of Mr. Ridley's countenance, who had overheard her.</p>
                  <p>That night—or morning, rather—Solomon Silver-bury laid his head upon his pillow
                     with the firm conviction that Nelly Goldthwaite was deeply in love with him;
                     which, in reality, was a very great mistake.</p>

                  <head type="sub">MR. SILVERBURY FALLS IN LOVE AND OUT AGAIN.</head>
                  <p>IT was late next morning when Mr. Silverbury awoke from his dreams, and
                     returned to his consciousness of outward things. As the events of the preceding
                     night slowly returned, and he took them into serious consideration, he found
                     himself obliged to make a very important decision, which was this,—that, in
                     consideration of his present limited means (five coppers and the expected
                     proceeds of his lecture), he should be wholly unable to maintain Miss Nelly
                     Goldthwaite in her present style of living, and therefore should not avail
                     himself of the preference which she had so openly manifested for him. Feeling
                     very much exalted by this heroic piece of self-denial, he arose and dressed
                     himself, made a scanty breakfast, and then prepared for a morning walk.</p>
                  <p>As he came down the stairs, he found Frank Willoughby, Mrs. Bluethorpe's nephew
                     from the country, waiting at the door, with the horse and wagon with which he
                     usually brought milk and vegetables to the city. At present, however, it was
                     cleared of its usual contents, and two nicely-cushioned seats fitted in. Eva
                     stood on the steps in her little neat white sun-bonnet, with her shaw! on her
                     arm, while Mrs. Bluethorpe was locking the door of her room.</p>
                  <p>"Good-morning, Mr. Silverbury," said she. "This is one of the Lord's own days;
                     and we intend to improve it to the utmost, for we are going to spend it in the
                     country. But mercy me! you poor, dear man! What a forlorn and lackadaisical
                     look you have this morning! Pray, what is the matter with you?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, nothing in particular!" replied Silverbury. "I was up rather late last
                     night, which, together with excitement and over-eating, has affected my whole
                     system."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then," said Mrs. Bluethorpe, "just jump into the wagon and take a ride
                     with us, and see how <emph>that</emph> will affect your system. Now, don't say
                     no, just for politeness' sake, but come right along;" and, seizing<pb
                        n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6310-00000125"/> him by-the arm with friendly force,
                     she drew him after her.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes, Silverbury!" called out Frank, as soon as he saw him: "you will make
                     a fine addition to our party. Strange I hadn't thought of you myself:
                     nevertheless, you are just as welcome."</p>
                  <p>No further words were necessary, for Mr. Silverbury was right glad of the
                     invitation; and, after helping Mrs. Bluethorpe and Eva into the wagon, he took
                     his seat with great satisfaction beside the worthy young farmer, whose cheerful
                     countenance, radiant with health and happiness, did one good to look upon.</p>
                  <p>As they rode along, Mr. Silverbury turned back to speak with the ladies, and,
                     for the first time, observed Mrs. Bluethorpe's bonnet. It was a mixed straw,
                     trimmed with a profusion of white satin bows, and was so very large and
                     old-fashioned that it formed a most amusing contrast to the mode of the present
                     day, Indeed, Mr. Silverbury's sense of the ridiculous was so keen, that he
                     found it impossible to look into that broad tunnel of straw, from which the
                     good lady's face beamed forth so radiantly, without smiling in a very ambiguous
                     manner. Therefore, to avoid seeming rudeness, he kept his eyes fixed on Eva,
                     who, with her sweet face and smiling blue eyes, peeping out from under her
                     white sun-bonnet, seemed to him the very embodiment of feminine delicacy and
                     loveliness.</p>
                  <p>Cloverdale Farm, the possession of the Willoughbys, was a most delightful
                     place. The house, with its numerous gables and cozy piazzas, just exactly
                     suited Mr. Silverbury's idea of the picturesque and beautiful; and, as they
                     drove up to the door under the great overshadowing owing elms, he thought how
                     happy he should be to spend his life in such a place with Eva for a companion.
                     His heart grew very tender toward her; and he resolved, that, so soon as he
                     held the proceeds of his lecture in his hands, he would make her a formal
                     proposition.</p>
                  <p>Every thing in and about the house was indicative of prosperity. It seemed the
                     central point of a rich and varied landscape; for all around, and stretching
                     far away in the background, were meadows and cornfields and orchards, woodlands
                     and pasture-grounds, one green swell rising beyond another, until at last a
                     broad, blue arm of the sea, stretching lovingly into the land, gave the last
                     finishing touch to the beautiful picture.</p>
                  <p>At first, Mr. Silverbury, with Eva by his side, flew to the cornfields to help
                     the men gather in the golden harvest. From thence, they turned aside into the
                     orchard, where the ripened fruit lay in crimson and golden heaps upon the
                     ground. Here, at noontime, the whole party, including all the laborers upon the
                     farm, sat down to a rustic feast under a fine old apple-tree; after which,
                     Silverbury prayed for Eva's company once more, as Frank and Mrs. Bluethorpe
                     were busy about the farm. They wandered away together over the hills and
                     through the woods until they came to the seashore, where the children were
                     gathering shells and moss upon the hard, white sand, and playing "catcher" with
                     the waves, which came rolling in as if meaning to swallow them all up at once.
                     Here, in a little sheltered nook in the rocks, they sat down together. Eva was
                     twining a wreath of oak-leaves for Mr. Silverbury's hat; and he, in return, was
                     arranging a bouquet of wild-flowers, which he had gathered on the way for
                     her.</p>
                  <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6310-00000126"/>
                  <p>He was very happy; and, as he sat there, in his mind he compared himself to the
                     old heathen deity Sylvanus, and Eva to his attendant wood-nymph. He looked down
                     at the sea, however; and the thought occurred to him that it would be better to
                     compare himself to Neptune, and Eva to a water-spirit, a Lorely or an Undine,
                     or some other such fabulous being. But then he remembered, that, from his
                     childhood, he always had an especial dread of the slippery, dripping
                     inhabitants of the watery deep, and therefore he dismissed this idea also. It
                     was a settled point, however, that he felt very much like some of the old
                     heathen deities, but which, he could not exactly tell.</p>
                  <p>As he watched Eva's fingers twining the green leaves so gracefully, and saw how
                     the changing color came and went in her cheeks as she pursued the pleasant
                     task, wholly unconscious that his eye was upon her, he felt his heart drawn
                     toward her most irresistibly; and he would have declared his passion on the
                     spot, but every time he attempted to say any thing to that effect he was seized
                     with a violent fit of coughing, until at last the rush of contending emotions
                     became so painful that he sighed heavily, and, complaining that the sea-air was
                     not good for him, proposed returning to the house.</p>
                  <p>It was near sundown when they arrived, and the chickens were all gathered about
                     the door waiting to be fed. Eva was delighted to perform this service; and, as
                     she stood scattering the corn among them, Mr. Silverbury could not help
                     thinking how much like a picture she looked, such as he had seen in books. He
                     was seized with a great desire to have some fowls of his own, to keep in Mrs.
                     Bluethorpe's back yard, so that he could see Eva feed them every night, if she
                     were willing to do so. He spoke of it very privately to Mrs. Bluethorpe, who
                     seemed to approve the plan; and therefore he decided at once upon a purchase.
                     He took out his portmonnaie with much confidence, when the click of those five
                     miserable coppers immediately disconcerted him. He thought, then, that perhaps
                     Frank would trust him till he should be able to pay; but, upon applying to him,
                     he found that the fowls belonged to a man who went shares with him on the
                     farm.</p>
                  <p>"Never mind, though," said Frank: "if you want the fowls, I am perfectly
                     willing to lend you the money."</p>
                  <p>"Just a dollar or two," said Silverbury; and without hesitation it was passed
                     over.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lyman was called, and the bargain concluded at once, leaving to Mr.
                     Silverbury the privilege of a choice. He immediately selected two speckled hens
                     and a Cochin-China rooster, who seemed to be king of the flock, and then
                     proceeded to catch them; but the frightened creatures started away over the
                     open field at the top of their speed, and Silverbury after them. The rooster,
                     in particular, spread out his wings, stretched his neck, and, with discordant
                     screams, fled like a young ostrich, using his long legs to wonderful advantage.
                     His female companions, though far in the rear, did not fail to keep beyond
                     Silverbury's reach. Over the stone fence they went, through a blackberry patch,
                     and then directly into a thicket of tangled grape-vines and ivy.</p>
                  <p>Panting with fatigue, Silverbury seated himself upon a stump, and reflected
                     seriously on the uncertainty of worldly possessions. In a few moments, Eva came
                     up, laughing merrily, with a basin of corn in her hand.</p>
                  <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6310-00000127"/>
                  <p>"O you foolish man!" said she: "don't you know that such creatures are very
                     much like the ladies,—to be caught by fair means, and not by foul? Just step
                     behind the tree there, for they will not show their heads as long as they can
                     see you, and perhaps I can get them in a few moments."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Silverbury stepped behind the tree, and Eva took her seat on the stump. She
                     shook the corn gently, clucking and calling softly at the same time. Presently
                     the rooster made his appearance, and then the hens, stepping cautiously, and
                     looking to the right and left. Mr. Silverbury did not wonder that they obeyed
                     her call; for her voice was so irresistible, that he could scarce help coming
                     himself. In one moment more, they were eating from the basin. Eva quickly threw
                     her shawl over them; and Mr. Silverbury, springing forward, took possession of
                     his property in triumph.</p>
                  <p>As there was a clear, bright moon that night, they did not set out for the city
                     until after nightfall, and then were accompanied by Mr. Lyman, instead of
                     Frank. As they arrived at their own door, Mrs. Bluethorpe concluded to go
                     farther with Mr. Lyman into the city, to make some purchases to send back to
                     the farm, leaving Eva in the care of Mr. Silverbury. He helped her out of the
                     wagon; and as he stepped upon the sidewalk, with his arm around her waist, and
                     the bunch of fowls in his other hand, he encountered Miss Nelly Goldthwaite,
                     leaning upon the arm of Mr. Ridley.</p>
                  <p>It was evident that she saw him, for the street-light shone full in his face;
                     and, moreover, she turned and glanced over her shoulder at him. Mr. Silverbury,
                     however, was indifferent; for he felt that he had an angel by his side, who was
                     far more to him: and when, a few moments after, he found himself seated near
                     Eva in Mrs. Bluethorpe's cozy parlor, he dropped upon his knee before her, and
                     gave utterance to his overflowing heart in a most eloquent and poetical manner.
                     Eva listened quietly until he had exhausted his stock of words, and paused for
                     a reply; then she said in the sweetest tone imaginable,—</p>
                  <p>"I am very sorry, Mr. Silverbury, to disappoint you; but then I am engaged to
                     Frank Willoughby, and we are to be married next week."</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" said Mr. Silverbury, as he rose from his knees and dusted his pants, "so
                     I thought. Excuse me: I meant no harm."</p>
                  <p>He didn't exactly know what he was saying, but he felt himself under the most
                     pressing necessity of saying something. After several ineffectual attempts at
                     conversation, interspersed with awkward silences, Mr. Silverbury complained of
                     fatigue, and withdrew. His room, however, seemed so lonely, so dark and
                     cheerless, that he could not stay there, and therefore went up to see the
                     Fairless. Genie was alone, stitching away upon her shoes as busily as ever.</p>
                  <p>"Genie," said Silverbury, after a short, preliminary conversation, "did you
                     know that Eva Leslie is to be married next week?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," replied Genie.</p>
                  <p>"Well then," said Silverbury somewhat testily, "why didn't you tell me?"</p>
                  <p>"Because," she replied, with a pause, as she seized her needle with her teeth
                     to draw it through a hard place in the leather, "I thought you would soon find
                     it out yourself by the way you were going on."</p>
                  <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6310-00000128"/>
                  <p>"That I have to my sorrow," returned Silverbury with a sigh.</p>
                  <p>"Why, you didn't propose, did you?" said Genie mischievously.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I did, though; and a little timely friendship on your part might have
                     saved me from my present mortification."</p>
                  <p>"Well," she replied, "I suppose I <emph>should</emph> have spoken if I had had
                     the least idea that a man without a dollar in the world, without business, and
                     with nothing in expectation, could have thought of offering himself to any
                     sensible girl."</p>
                  <p>"What!" exclaimed Silverbury, springing to his feet, and assuming an oratorical
                     attitude, "must a value in dollars and cents be set upon the holy sentiment of
                     love itself?"</p>
                  <p>"Not <emph>love,</emph>" said Genie, "for that costs nothing; but 'tis
                        <emph>matrimony</emph> I mean. People don't seem to think, when they marry,
                     that so much of their happiness depends upon a certain degree of calculation
                     and foresight. A woman's hands soon get tied with family cares, and then a man
                     has double duty to perform. Then, besides, two or three hungry mouths may be
                     calling for bread; and a man ought to consider whether he is able, by money or
                     labor, to meet such responsibilities."</p>
                  <p>"Miss Fairlee!" exclaimed Silverbury, as he looked at her in astonishment, "if
                     any other lady had spoken such words, I should have termed them unpardonable
                     familiarity."</p>
                  <p>"It is the <emph>truth,</emph> any how," returned Genie coolly.</p>
                  <p>"Very well," continued Silverbury: "since you are so ready to speak, what
                     particular employment would you suggest to me, under my present
                     circumstances?"</p>
                  <p>Once more she pulled her needle through with her teeth, and then replied, after
                     some reflection,—</p>
                  <p>"Well, what I said before. Go into the country and help some farmer, or take a
                     book-agency, or get a place as clerk in some store."</p>
                  <p>"A clerk in a store!" repeated Mr. Silverbury with a look of inexpressible
                     contempt, as he strode to the door and opened it. "When I am clerk in a store,
                     I will come and offer myself to you, Miss Fairlee."</p>
                  <p>"Well," she replied, with perfect composure, "I hope you will. Now, don't
                     forget. Good-night, Mr. Silverbury!"</p>

                  <head type="sub">MR. SILVERBURY'S LECTURE AND THE RESULTS.</head>
                  <p>MR. SILVERBURY'S lecture was at length completed. As, with a hasty pen, he
                     traced the last word, he uttered a shout of triumph, and danced about the room
                     in such an excess of joy, that the poor little German woman locked her door in
                     all possible haste, thinking he had suddenly gone crazy. The next thing was to
                     bring it before the public. Both Woodruff and Goldthwaite lent their influence,
                     but nearly every lyceum and literary association had engaged lecturers; and, as
                     Mr. Silverbury was an individual as yet unknown to fame, all hesitated about
                     accepting his services.</p>
                  <p>At length, it was decided that he had best engage one<pb n="256-257"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000129"/> of the most popular halls in the city, give out
                     public notice of his lecture, and have tickets of admission. Accordingly the
                     bills were printed at Woodruff's expense, and due notice given to the public.
                     It will be as well to mention here, that, before the completion of the lecture,
                     Eva Leslie's marriage had taken place, and Mrs. Bluethorpe had gone with her
                     into the country; upon which, the Fairless had removed from the third to the
                     first floor. Mr. Silverbury sent them all complimentary tickets, however; for
                     it was a thought over which he rejoiced greatly in secret, that now he should
                     have an opportunity of showing Mrs. Eva Willoughby what she had lost by not
                     taking him, instead of that great, roundfaced farmer-boy.</p>
                  <p>At length, the eventful night arrived; and Mr. Silverbury prepared himself with
                     the greatest care for his appearance before the public. The little German
                     woman, who knew what was about to take place, and wishing to testify her good
                     will, just before his departure, brought him a glass of her lager-beer, which
                     she always kept on hand in remembrance of her "fatherland." Mr. Silverbury was
                     not at all accustomed to this beverage; but having heard that it <emph>would
                        not intoxicate,</emph> and also that it was highly recommended by some
                     physicians for its strengthening qualities, he took it without hesitation.</p>
                  <p>It was not long, however, before he felt greatly exalted in his feelings. He
                     had half a mind to leave his written lecture at home; for he felt he could give
                     a much better one on the inspiration of the moment. Nevertheless, to be on the
                     safe side, he thrust the manuscript into his pocket, and set out. He felt so
                     strangely, that he began to fear very much indeed that the beer was having an
                     injurious effect upon him. To prove the matter, he walked along the narrow
                     curbstone of the sidewalk, to see if he could keep his balance. He found that
                     he could, without difficulty, and therefore proceeded directly to the hall.</p>
                  <p>It was a novel situation for Mr. Silverbury, when he found himself seated
                     behind the desk, looking out upon his small, but highly-respectable audience.
                     It wanted a few moments of the appointed time. Stooping down, he arranged the
                     bow of his necktie, smoothed his hair, and, as many lecturers do, put a lozenge
                     in his mouth. Unfortunately, however, he had paid no attention to the quality,
                     and it happened to be flavored with cayenne. He coughed, he swallowed, he wiped
                     his eyes and nose again and again, and drank with eager haste from the glass of
                     water upon his desk. In the end, it was a decided benefit, however, for it
                     restored him to himself. After a few moments, he arose and commenced with
                     perfect composure.</p>
                  <p>For some time he progressed finely, and was becoming quite animated with his
                     subject, when his eye chanced to fall upon a wonderful bonnet, ornamented with
                     white bows, rising very prominently above the heads of his audience; and
                     therein he beheld Mrs. Bluethorpe's round, good-natured countenance looking out
                     upon him through her spectacles, and, with open mouth, listening in breathless
                     attention.</p>
                  <p>It was too much for him. He was so constituted that he could not restrain his
                     risibilities; and, even at this critical moment, he smiled. He entirely forgot
                     what he was saying; and, on glancing back to his manuscript, he<pb n="258-259"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000130"/> had lost his place. He cleared his voice, took a
                     swallow of water, and attempted it again; but it was of no use: the place could
                     not be found. In perfect desperation, he began to extemporize; but he felt as
                     if on the brink of a precipice, down which he expected to plunge every
                     moment.</p>
                  <p>At length his eye chanced to fall on the commencement of a paragraph; and he
                     eagerly caught at it, not knowing whether the thread of the discourse was fitly
                     joined or not. With a great effort at self-control, he proceeded. Not even Miss
                     Nelly Goldthwaite's beautiful face, to which a white rigolette, mingling its
                     tassel fringe with her dark tresses, added a new charm, could disturb him now.
                     He went on without further accident or interruption to the end; and yet he sat
                     down entirely dissatisfied, for he felt that he had not done himself or his
                     subject justice.</p>
                  <p>His audience had indeed made some faint demonstrations in the way of applause
                     at the last; but it was very ambiguous, and Mr. Silverbury was inclined to
                     think it was less from appreciation of what he said than from joy at the
                     conclusion. He did not believe there was one present who felt the force of what
                     he had labored so arduously to prove,—that this constant longing and labor and
                     strife, for the sake of a paltry dollar or two, was the greatest curse that had
                     ever fallen upon mankind. In fact, when he considered how very small the
                     proceeds of his lecture would be, he could not but modify his belief to
                     himself, and say that the real curse lay not so much in the labor as in not
                     obtaining.</p>
                  <p>He turned gravely away from the congratulations of his friends, and with the
                     two dollars in his pocket, which remained to him over and above the expenses,
                     returned to his home, a deeply-disappointed man. For a full half-hour he sat
                     alone in his room, but in the deepest meditation; and then, feeling the need of
                     human sympathy, more, perhaps, than ever before in his life, he went below to
                     spend a few moments with the Fairlees. The old gentleman and his wife had
                     retired; but Genie sat there as usual, stitching away upon her shoes with all
                     her might.</p>
                  <p>"Genie," he said, after being seated a few moments, "you were at the lecture
                     to-night: tell me honestly, how did I succeed?"</p>
                  <p>"Well," she replied, "you made out much better than I expected; but"—and then
                     she hesitated.</p>
                  <p>"But what?" said Mr. Silverbury anxiously.</p>
                  <p>Genie laid down her work, and, moving her chair close beside him, laid her hand
                     in his, and looked him quietly in the face.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Silverbury," she said, "will you allow me to speak to you as a sensible
                     woman and a sister?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly," he replied.</p>
                  <p>"Well, then," she continued, "every question has two sides, and you have only
                     looked at this from one point of view. The ever-grasping, never-to-be-satisfied
                     spirit of avarice, that heaps up its thousands and still covets more, is,
                     indeed, a curse; but God has so arranged the order of human affairs, that
                     earnest, honest labor shall produce the means whereby one can enjoy the
                     comforts and blessings of life with a clear conscience. The covetous man and
                     the miser wrong the world and their own souls; but he who cheerfully earns a
                     dollar or two, and with it makes himself and those around him<pb n="260-261"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000131"/> happy, stands approved in the sight of God and
                     all good men. Therefore, Mr. Silverbury, I believe, that if, instead of going
                     up among the clouds to prove theories which none can easily practice, you had
                     come down among the sober realities of life, and pursued some humble but useful
                     employment, you would have been a much happier and wiser man than you are now.
                     Don't you think so yourself?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Silverbury still held her hand in his; and as he sat and gazed into her
                     great, earnest eyes, a deep conviction of the truth of that which she had
                     spoken entered into his soul.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," he replied, "I do; for you yourself prove it to me. All my knowledge
                     from books has failed to teach me that which you have learned so well from your
                     daily experience. I am heart-sick, and entirely disappointed; but you have
                     spoken the right words at the right time. And now, God helping me, I will
                     become a wiser and more useful man."</p>
                  <p>He arose from his seat with much emotion, and then—perhaps we should not tell;
                     but, gently stroking her soft brown hair, he pressed his lips one moment to her
                     fair forehead, and turned away with the feeling of one, who, after struggling
                     long against his adverse fate, and stumbling in the darkness, looks up and sees
                     the clear star of hope shining calmly down upon him.</p>

                  <head type="sub">MR. SILVERBURY TURNS OVER A NEW LEAF, AND ENDS WITH A
                     CONFESSION.</head>
                  <p>A FEW days after the unsuccessful issue of the lecture, Mr. Silverbury went out
                     in search of employment, resolved to do or die. He was not obliged to seek
                     long, however; for, through the influence of his friend Woodruff, he obtained
                     an excellent situation as head clerk in the extensive dry-goods establishment
                     of Messrs. Farrell &amp; Varnum. His predecessor had suddenly departed, without
                     taking leave of his employers, to parts unknown, leaving the accounts in a very
                     disorderly condition. Mr. Silverbury set himself to work with his whole soul to
                     restore things to the regularity and exactness which business so imperatively
                     demands, and succeeded to the satisfaction of himself and employers. For the
                     first few weeks his resolution sustained him; and then his occupation seemed a
                     dull, intolerable drudgery. But still, with many a sigh and hard-fought battle
                     in his own soul, he persevered, until he became accustomed to the dull routine,
                     and really began to feel at peace with himself and the world. He had no time
                     now to keep bachelor's hall: therefore he had given up his room, and gone to
                     board with the Fairless. They were a happy family, take them all together: for
                     the old lady, though an invalid, was cheerful; and Genie, with her quiet good
                     sense and never-tiring industry, made every thing move on in the most
                     harmonious order.</p>
                  <p>Thus the winter wore away, and once more the<pb n="262-263"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000132"/> spring opened. Then Mr. Silverbury observed that
                     the Fairlees often held secret consultations together, which were ended
                     abruptly so soon as he made his appearance. He knew that some plan was under
                     consideration, which was carefully concealed from him, though for what reason
                     he could not tell; and it troubled him greatly. Finally, however, he returned
                     home late from the store one night, and found Genie sitting up for him, which
                     she was not accustomed to do.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Silverbury," she said, in her usual quiet manner," "I have something to
                     tell you."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed!" he exclaimed, in a joking way, as he seized a chair and seated
                     himself quickly before her. "Pray, what is it?"</p>
                  <p>Genie smiled, and then grew quite serious.</p>
                  <p>"It is this," she continued. "In the course of two or three weeks, we shall all
                     move into the country. Father and I have saved enough from our earnings to
                     stock a small farm; and we think it will be better and more profitable for us
                     all than our present employment."</p>
                  <p>"And what is to become of me, then?" said Silverbury, growing serious in his
                     turn.</p>
                  <p>"That is what has troubled us most, and why we have not felt willing to speak
                     to you of this before. We have all known you so long, and become so much
                     attached to you, that we shall find it hard parting now."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Silverbury arose, and walked the room thoughtfully.</p>
                  <p>"I was not expecting this," he said. "I had just begun to feel that I had a
                     quiet home, and that life had much happiness in store for me; but now, all at
                     once, it changes, and I am sent forth to battle with my fate once more. Well, I
                     suppose that so it <emph>must</emph> be, and I must learn to bear it."</p>
                  <p>He stopped before Genie, and looked her earnestly in the face. She did not
                     raise her eyes; but he saw that the tears were stealing silently down her
                     cheeks.</p>
                  <p>"Genie, Genie!" he exclaimed, as he seized both her hands in his, "whatever
                     else I lose in this world, I can not part with you. Never till this moment did
                     I know how great an influence you have over me; but gently and quietly, as is
                     your very nature, have you stolen into my heart, and now I can not live without
                     you. I told you once, scornfully, that, if ever I were a clerk in a store, I
                     would come and offer myself to you; and now, all unworthy as I am, here do I
                     stand to perform my promise in serious earnest. You have been my counsellor and
                     helper, my friend and sister. O Genie! Genie! be still more to me!"</p>
                  <p>"Why, Mr. Silverbury!" she said, with seeming composure.</p>
                  <p>"For heaven's sake, Genie!" he exclaimed, "throw aside that quiet reserve for
                     one moment, and speak out like a true, warm-hearted woman."</p>
                  <p>The poor girl burst into a flood of tears.</p>
                  <p>"I will," she said, "for I can keep quiet no longer. I <emph>do</emph> love
                     you, Mr. Silverbury; but I am a poor, homely, simple-hearted girl, and
                     therefore know I can not make you happy."</p>
                  <p>"Away with beauty, wealth, and fashion!" said Silverbury indignantly. "Give me
                     honest labor and a true heart, and it is enough. Genie, your lot and mine in
                     life shall henceforth be one."</p>
                  <p>A few weeks after this, and the Fairlees, according to<pb n="264-265"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000133"/> their intention, had removed into the country;
                     but Mr. Silverbury, as the husband of Genie, accompanied them. He still
                     continued his business in the city; but so arranged it that he could return
                     early, at the close of each day, and labor some time on the farm.</p>
                  <p>It so happened, one September afternoon, as he was engaged in raking up the
                     last cuttings from the greensward before his door, that his friend Woodruff
                     came riding along on horseback, and stopped for a few moment's
                     conversation.</p>
                  <p>"By the way, Silverbury," he said at last, with a roguish look in his eye, "do
                     you intend to lecture again this winter? The one you wrote last season had a
                     short run. Suppose you try it again."</p>
                  <p>Silverbury made a threatening movement toward him with the rake.</p>
                  <p>"Lorenzo Woodruff," said he, "as you love me, do not mention that again; for
                     now I am looking at the world from an entirely different point of view. We must
                     all labor, if we would be happy; and the honest reward of industry is one of
                     the greatest blessings of Divine Providence. I have no need to counsel thee, O
                     Lorenzo!" he added with mock gravity, "to secure in time thy share of 'filthy
                     lucre;' for that thou wilt by no means fail to do. As for myself, I can truly
                     say, that, since I have had some one to love and to labor for, there is not a
                     man in the world who can more fully appreciate the true worth of 'A Dollar or
                     Two' than Solomon Silverbury."</p>

                  <p>GOOD heavens! what do I see?" exclaimed Antonio Myrtleby, the young gardener,
                     as he ceased watering his flowers, and looked up with admiring eyes to the
                     balcony of Grimwig Hall. There stood Lady Geraldine, the only child of Sir
                     Gregory Grimwig, in all the glow and sunshine of her youthful beauty, looking
                     lovely enough to break one's heart. The rich jewels on her bosom flashed in the
                     sunlight, the breeze played with her golden ringlets, and her long white veil
                     floated around her like the airy cloud which envelops blessed spirits. "As sure
                     as I live," continued Antonio to himself, "she wears those self-same lilies and
                     roses in her hair that I made bold to offer her this morning! Now, what may I
                     think of that? Ah, that I had offered myself! But what a madcap I am! Mind thy
                     business, Antonio. Thou art a poor gardener;" and he went on with renewed
                     diligence, almost drowning the lilies and roses, and leaving the poppies and
                     sweet-williams to beseech the cloudless<pb n="266-267"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000134"/> heavens for a more bountiful supply. He was very
                     industrious for a time: and his head and heart were busy also, thinking of the
                     beautiful human flower in the balcony of Grimwig Hall; calling fondly to memory
                     the many times she had walked in the garden to admire the flowers, and how she
                     had once sat on the steps of his mother's cottage, and talked lovingly with his
                     sister Mabel, while he played on his guitar under the old elmtree. Dear! dear!
                     How could he help it?</p>
                  <p>At length he ventured one more look; but she was gone, for the sun had set, and
                     the dew was falling. So, after putting his spade and hoe in their places, and
                     hanging the watering-pot by the old well, he went home to his supper.</p>
                  <p>"Bless your dear heart!" said good Mother Myrtle-by, as she regarded him with a
                     look of deep affection: "what an appetite you have to-night, Antonio, my boy!
                     You have been working hard to-day, I think."</p>
                  <p>"That I have, mother dear," replied Antonio; "and I feel right cheerful, too,
                     which you know always gives one a good relish for his supper." So the old lady
                     brought some fresh rolls and another pat of butter for the table, and sat down
                     again to her knitting.</p>
                  <p>When the moon rose, Antonio took his guitar, as was his custom, and went out
                     under the old elm-tree to play. He heard the sound of a fiddle and tamborine in
                     the distance, and he knew that the youths and maidens of the village were
                     dancing on the green; but he did not wish to join them, for his heart was
                     elsewhere. So he looked up through the green boughs, and fell desperately in
                     love with the moon. As his hand wandered carelessly over the strings of his
                     guitar, such a beautiful song came from his lips—which might have applied to
                     the moon, or any fair lady—that he himself was surprised.</p>
                  <p>"What a beautiful night it is!" he said musingly; and, taking his guitar upon
                     his shoulder, he walked forth into the moonlight. "I wonder how the lilies and
                     roses look, all sparkling with dew in this silver light." So he sauntered away
                     toward the Hall; but he forgot to look at the flowers. He walked carelessly by
                     them; and, seating himself under a little bower of lilacs and syringas, he
                     began to play upon his guitar. In a few moments he gained courage, and with a
                     loud, clear voice, he repeated his song.</p>
                  <p>"Who's there? who's there, I say?" cried a gruff voice from an upper window.
                     "If you are a love-sick young man, you had better go home before you get cold.
                     It's no use maneuvering after my daughter. I can take care of her myself. So go
                     home, shallowpate!"</p>
                  <p>"Ah! Sir Gregory, is that you?" said Antonio, as he stepped forth boldly. "I
                     hope I have not disturbed you with my little sonnet to the moon."</p>
                  <p>"Eh, Antonio! I thought you was some one else. So that was not intended for my
                     daughter?"</p>
                  <p>"Your daughter! Fie! No, sir: I should not spend my breath to so little
                     purpose."</p>
                  <p>"What's that you say, young man? Have a care! My daughter is a judge of music.
                     She has an ear for it, and no man shall speak lightly of her. Take your guitar,
                     sir, and go round to the left wing of the hall, and sing that song to her under
                     the willow branches; but mind you don't speak one word to her. Let her<pb
                        n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6310-00000135"/> think that it is a young man in love
                     if she will. Ah, ha! that's a joke!"</p>
                  <p>"As you will, Sir Gregory. It is a pleasure to obey you;" and in a few moments
                     Antonio was singing like a bird from the willow branches close by Geraldine's
                     window. The light was darkened in the room, the curtain was raised, and a fair
                     face gleamed forth in the moonlight. "Antonio!" she whispered. Still Antonio
                     sung,— <q>

                           <l>"Hist! lady, hist! I speak no word:</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>"O Antonio!" she whispered again: "I like your songs; but it is very wrong of
                     you to come here, and, if you do not wish to offend me, you will go away." <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Farewell, sweet lady, I obey,</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">Since you have said, 'Depart!'</l>
                           <l>But grant one kindly word, I pray,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>She stretched her white hand from the window. Antonio pressed it to his lips,
                     and sprang from the tree.</p>
                  <p>"Did you do as I told you?" said Sir Gregory, who still sat at his window,
                     waiting for the appearance of Antonio.</p>
                  <p>"Exactly, sir."</p>
                  <p>"And were you mindful not to speak one word?"</p>
                  <p>"Not a word, sir."</p>
                  <p>"That's right, my boy. Now go home."</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>THE next morning Antonio was busy with his flowers, as usual, when two horsemen
                     rode up the great avenue that led to the front entrance of the Hall. The
                     foremost, from his dress and manner, appeared to be a person of distinction. He
                     wore a sword with a jeweled hilt, a star glittered on his breast, and a white
                     plume nodded in his helmet. The other appeared to be his servant.</p>
                  <p>"Who in the world can that be?" said Antonio, as he leaned thoughtfully upon
                     his hoe; "and what business can he have here?" But he did not have to wait many
                     days to find out the stranger's intentions. Lord Ludore, for so he was called,
                     devoted himself entirely to Geraldine. He rode, he walked and talked with her;
                     and looked down upon Antonio when he passed him, as though he were an
                     earth-worm. But Geraldine always greeted him with a sweet smile, and received
                     the flowers he offered her as kindly and gracefully as if they had come from
                     the hand of Lord Ludore himself. It was a hard thing for Antonio, and he
                     labored more busily than ever, in order to drive away evil thoughts; but, when
                     he came to look over his work, he found roots of violets and mignonnette wrong
                     side up, and poppies and primroses tied up to trellises. Thus the week wore
                     away; and he went home from his work on Saturday night, never so tired.</p>
                  <p>Mother Myrtleby met him at the door, with a glowing<pb n="270-271"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000136"/> ing countenance. "O Antonio!" she exclaimed.
                     "Good news! To-morrow morning Lord Ludore and Lady Geraldine will be married in
                     the chapel. All the tenants and villagers are invited; and at noon we are all
                     to dine at the Hall, and Lord Ludore and Lady Geraldine will sit down with us.
                     Oh, my! She is an angel!"</p>
                  <p>Antonio did not throw up his hat, or turn a somerset, or do any thing
                     extravagant, as she expected. Without even so much as a smile, he sat down, and
                     leaned his head on the window-seat. Then he took his hat; and, telling her that
                     he did not care for any supper, he went out, and left her gazing after him in
                     speechless astonishment.</p>
                  <p>Struggling bravely with his troubled spirit, he turned toward the forest. There
                     he met with Estelle and Rosalind, two merry-hearted girls, with bright eyes and
                     waving ringlets, who were gathering flowers for the morrow. They saw him; and,
                     kissing their hands to him, they called him to come and help them; but when he
                     shook his head, and turned from them with a melancholy smile, they sent whole
                     showers of leaves and blossoms after him.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! they are very beautiful and happy girls," said he. "Why is it that I have
                     not given my heart to one of them, and not suffered myself to be so deceived by
                     the gentle smiles and winning ways of the lovely Geraldine?" Then his heart
                     gave the true answer, that, although they were indeed brilliant and bewitching,
                     yet they possessed not that quiet grace and tender sensibility which education
                     and refinement had shed like a halo of light around the fair Geraldine. This it
                     was that had taken hold of the deepest feelings of his nature, for Antonio had
                     no common mind.</p>
                  <p>It was a late hour when he turned his steps homeward. Unconsciously he sought
                     the flower-garden once more; and again he threw himself on the soft green
                     grass, under the little bower of lilacs and syringas. Suddenly he heard the
                     sound of footsteps; and, raising his head, saw two persons approaching each
                     other from opposite directions. They met on the other side of the shrubs.</p>
                  <p>"Wilson, is that you?" said one, in a low tone. "How have you succeeded?"</p>
                  <p>In an instant Antonio recognized the one addressed as Wilson to be Lord
                     Ludore.</p>
                  <p>"Admirably!" he replied. "Do you see this strong box? In this is the old man's
                     gold, the most valuable pieces of plate, and many of the daughter's jewels. Now
                     let's be off, and get the horses as soon as possible."</p>
                  <p>"But the daughter?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! she will rejoice. The old man was blinded by my supposed wealth and title,
                     and so he urged me hard upon her; but she has resisted to the last, protesting
                     that she loved another. Now let him take her. I have got all I came for. I will
                     place the box under the bushes here, while I help you get the horses; for the
                     sooner we are gone the better."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, yes! whispered Antonio, as he saw them depart; "and I will take care of it
                     for you." He seized the box, and, without delay, hastened to the Hall, and
                     knocked loudly at the door.</p>
                  <p>"Who's there?" cried Sir Gregory from the upper window.</p>
                  <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6310-00000137"/>
                  <p>"Only I,—Antonio. Make haste and let me in; for I have something of importance
                     to tell you."</p>
                  <p>The old man quickly opened the door, and conducted Antonio to the drawing-room,
                     where he placed the box on the table, and told his story in a very few words.
                     Sir Gregory was silent with astonishment. He looked first at the box and then
                     at Antonio, and paced the floor to and fro, as if completely bewildered. At
                     length he grasped the bell, and rang it violently. "Sullens," said he to the
                     half-awakened servant, "call Geraldine."</p>
                  <p>With a pale face and wondering eyes, Geraldine obeyed this midnight summons.
                     "Sit down," my child," said her father. "Now, Antonio, will you tell us what
                     you have to say once more?"</p>
                  <p>Again Antonio repeated his story. Geraldine bowed her head upon the table, and
                     burst into tears.</p>
                  <p>"Dear, dear!" exclaimed Sir Gregory. "What shall I do? I can't bear to see the
                     girl cry: I never could. I thought she would be glad. Geraldine, my darling,
                     don't take on so, for goodness' sake! I say, he's a villain, and I am an old
                     fool; but, if you love him, you shall marry him now if you want to."</p>
                  <p>"O father!" sobbed Geraldine, "I told you that I did not love him!"</p>
                  <p>"So you did, child. Now, don't cry any more, and you shall marry the one you
                     love, no matter who he is, if he is only honest,—honest as Antonio here, who
                     has saved me half my fortune. Ah, my friend! My noble friend! What can I do for
                     you?"</p>
                  <p>Geraldine raised her head, and glanced first at her father, and then at
                     Antonio. It was more than Antonio nio could bear: his heart was full already.
                     He sprang forward; and, kneeling at her feet, he clasped her hand in his. "O
                     Lady Geraldine!" he exclaimed: "dearest lady, Antonio is very poor; but he has
                     a heart rich in affection and love, that the wealth of the Indies could not
                     buy. He gives it all to you; and feels, that, could he sacrifice his very life,
                     it were but a poor offering to your loveliness and virtue." She did not speak;
                     but her head was bowed still lower, her golden ringlets swept his cheek, and
                     she sobbed upon his shoulder.</p>
                  <p>"Take her, take her, Antonio!" cried Sir Gregory, as he vainly attempted to
                     wipe away the tears which chased each other down his cheek: "you always were a
                     noble fellow; and, if you will take as good care of my little rosebud as you
                     have of the flowers in my garden, I will thank Heaven that things are so
                     ordered."</p>

                  <p>NEVER, since Adam dwelt in Eden, had a fairer morning dawned upon the earth
                     than that which was to have witnessed the union of Lord Ludore and Lady
                     Geraldine. The chapel-bell rang out its merriest peal; and the happy villagers
                     and tenants came from all quarters of the broad estate, dressed in their
                     holiday suits. There were young men with knots of ribbons in their
                     button-holes, and wreaths around their hats; and maidens dressed in white, with
                     beautiful flowers<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6310-00000138"/> for the bride.
                     There, too, were old men leaning upon their staves, and matronly ladies in
                     scarlet petticoats and black bodices, with high-crowned caps, white as the
                     drifted snow. And besides all these were troops of frolicsome children, that
                     only seemed to want wings to carry them up into the summer air among the birds
                     and butterflies.</p>
                  <p>Thus they had gathered in the chapel, and were waiting anxiously, when the
                     sound of a carriage was heard. All were tiptoe with expectation, when the doors
                     were thrown wide open, and Antonio, looking more like a lord than many a man
                     that wears a coronet, with the beautiful Lady Geraldine leaning upon his arm,
                     came straight forward to the altar. There were winks, and nods, and expressions
                     of wonder, that could by no means be suppressed.</p>
                  <p>Mother Myrtleby stood up on the very tips of her wooden shoes, and waved her
                     great palm-leaf fan wildly. She waited till the ceremony was finished, till she
                     was sure that it was ended, and then she fainted.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                  <p>THE well-known and much-respected Widow Greenleaf sat in her quiet parlor one
                     afternoon in June, knitting very industriously. Now and then, when she had
                     finished a needle, she would lay down her work, just a moment, to watch the
                     bees among the honeysuckles at the window, or the great spotted butterflies and
                     humming-birds that came flitting and buzzing about for their share of the
                     sweets. At the same time she would cast a hasty glance up the main road that
                     led from the village, but, seeing nothing satisfactory, would resume her work
                     with double diligence.</p>
                  <p>It would have been very evident to any common observer, from the good lady's
                     outward appearance, and the fact that this most choice apartment was now thrown
                     open to the light and heat of a summer sun, that this was no ordinary occasion.
                     A black silk dress of rather ancient mode, but still very precious in her eye,
                        adorned<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6310-00000139"/> her ample person. Upon
                     her shoulders was spread out in snowy whiteness a wrought muslin collar,
                     somewhat large for the fashion. It was confined at the throat by an antique
                     breastpin, containing a lock of hair, which, doubtless, was a memento of the
                     deceased Mr. Greenleaf. Her cap seemed to be the work of later years; and, with
                     its tasteful arrangement of ruche and green gauze ribbon, was really very
                     becoming to the wearer. In truth, setting aside all the advantages of external
                     adornment, Mrs. Greenleaf was well-favored and fair to look upon, although her
                     years were not few. Her exact age could not be ascertained; but it was
                     somewhere on the shady side of fifty. Time had sprinkled her locks with gray,
                     and left a few furrows on her placid brow; but the glow of health still tinged
                     her round, smooth cheeks, and a look of cheerful good nature spread its light
                     over her whole countenance.</p>
                  <p>Thus she sat in her high-backed rocking-chair on this afternoon in June,
                     knitting very busily, when, suddenly, as if she had just recollected something,
                     she laid down her work; and turning her head toward a door which stood slightly
                     ajar, she called out,—</p>
                  <p>"Lena, Lena! are you asleep?" But no reply was given. She arose and entered the
                     apartment.</p>
                  <p>Beside a low workstand, on which lay an open writing-desk, sat a delicate and
                     slightly-formed girl. Her hair, which seemed to have been carefully arranged,
                     was now pushed back from her forehead; her elbows rested upon the desk, and her
                     face was hidden in her hands. A sheet of paper, partly written over, lay before
                     her, blistered in many places by the tear-drops which had fallen from between
                     her long, slender fingers.</p>
                  <p>"Lena!" said the widow again, as she laid her hand upon the girl's shoulder;
                     but still she remained silent. She shook her gently. Lena raised her head, and
                     looked up with a bewildered gaze.</p>
                  <p>"Poor child!" said the good lady in a sympathizing tone: "have you been
                     asleep?"</p>
                  <p>"No, Aunt Patience," replied the girl slowly, seeming at the same time as if
                     only half conscious that she spoke. "I've only been
                     thinking—thinking—thinking."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, dear!" responded the aunt: "I believe so much thinking will certainly kill
                     you. Why, child! your hands are as cold as clay; and you tremble like a leaf.
                     Do, pray, come out into the sunshine and warm you. Dr. Purdie will soon be
                     here, and I mean to have a long talk with him about you."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>He</emph> can't do me any good," said Lena, in the same indifferent
                     tone.</p>
                  <p>"Well, at any rate, do come out into the sunshine." And she looked anxiously at
                     the girl's thin, white hand, in which the blood circulated so feebly that the
                     tips of the fingers were even then slightly tinged with purple.</p>
                  <p>"Just let me finish this page, aunt, and then I will come."</p>
                  <p>"Well, only that one page; and pray do it without thinking."</p>
                  <p>The good lady went back to her knitting; but her countenance had lost some of
                     its serenity, and, as she picked up a few truant stitches, a faintly-whispered
                     "Oh, dear!" showed that her kind heart was troubled. So absorbing were her
                     thoughts, that she did not perceive the sound of approaching footsteps. A loud,
                     double rap<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6310-00000140"/> announced a caller; and
                     the good lady started up in great haste, with visible confusion, to answer the
                     summons.</p>
                  <p>A short, portly gentleman, of some sixty years, with a light beaver hat and
                     gold-bowed specs, was ushered into the room. This was the same individual whose
                     name and profession were made known to the public by a certain sign in the
                     village, bearing, in large gilt capitals, the inscription, "Pelham Purdie,
                     Physician and Practical Phrenologist;" which accidental alliteration rendered
                     him an object of great interest in the eyes of the village children, as thereby
                     he was closely associated in their minds with "Peter Piper," the famous
                     gatherer of "pickled peppers."</p>
                  <p>"This is a decidedly warm day, ma'am," he remarked, as he disposed of his hat,
                     and, throwing himself into a chair by the window, seized the great palm-leaf
                     fan on the table.</p>
                  <p>"Very true," replied the widow. She wiped the perspiration from her face with
                     her handkerchief, and observed that the heat overcame her very much.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," replied the doctor: "all people in whom the sanguine and lymphatic
                     temperaments incline to predominate—take you and myself, for instance, for I
                     think we are similar in that respect—are sensibly affected by the heat. Where
                     the arterial system co-operates in harmony with the digestive functions,
                     sufficient animal heat is generated for all necessary comfort; therefore, when
                     the heats of summer prevail, such people as you and I, my dear Mrs. Greenleaf,
                     are obliged to suffer a temporary martyrdom. But, after all, there is an
                     advantage in it; for we can keep cheerful tempers and warm hearts in our bosoms
                     the year round! Yes, Mrs. Greenleaf, warm hearts the year round!" and this
                     sentiment was accompanied by a light laugh, half stifled in the depths of his
                     capacious lungs, but which added great significance to his words.</p>
                  <p>"Very true," replied the lady, and she continued her knitting without looking
                     up.</p>
                  <p>An awkward silence followed, during which Dr. Purdie unconsciously stretched
                     his hand from the window, and closed up the petals of a half-blown hollyhock.
                     Unfortunately the flower contained a bee, over head and ears in sweets, who,
                     finding himself thus suddenly made prisoner, instinctively avenged the injury
                     by thrusting his sting into the offender's finger. The doctor gave an
                     exclamation of surprise and pain, which was followed by an explanation. The
                     sympathizing lady insisted upon doing up the wound immediately. It occupied her
                     some time; but at last it was completed to the satisfaction of both
                     parties.</p>
                  <p>"And now," said the doctor, "where is my patient, that is to be,—Miss
                     Helena?"</p>
                  <p>Upon entering the room, Mrs. Greenleaf found her niece sitting as she had
                     previously, in the same position, with the unfinished page still before her,
                     and apparently insensible to all around. It required some effort to arouse her
                     to consciousness, and persuade her to come into the presence of the amiable
                     physician. When she did, however, she seated herself upon the sofa beside him,
                     as stiff and cold as a newly-frozen icicle, with her face half averted from the
                     scientific gaze which was bent keenly upon her.</p>
                  <p>The doctor took her hand. "A very feeble pulse,"<pb n="280-281"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000141"/> he said in a low tone, as if thinking aloud;
                     "languid circulation; great nervous debility and prostration of the whole
                     system; a morbid state of the liver; impaired digestion and loss of appetite; a
                     strong aversion to active pursuits; extremely sensitive, and at times irritable
                     and impatient."</p>
                  <p>Lena drew her hand from him by a quick movement. She felt that she was
                     undergoing the same scientific scrutiny and critical analysis which he would
                     have employed upon a lifeless subject in anatomy; and therefore she shrank from
                     his gaze as she would from the touch of the scalpel.</p>
                  <p>"Stop, my dear!" he said: "I am not quite done with you."</p>
                  <p>He placed his hand upon her head. "Small lungs, with a large and active brain,"
                     he continued; "a great inclination for metaphysical reasoning; ideality large,
                     which, combined with the temperament and a most overpowering sense of the
                     sublime and beautiful, would lead to the composition of poetry. That is
                     bad,—very bad! Hope small,—a tendency to look on the dark side; great love of
                     approbation; secretiveness pretty full. Bless me, what adhesiveness! Why, an
                     unfortunate attachment would prove fatal!"</p>
                  <p>A visible tremor shook the girl's whole frame, but she bit her thin lips
                     nervously, and remained silent.</p>
                  <p>"Very excitable," continued the doctor. "Here is this pulse, now, leaping like
                     a startled hare. I tell you what, my girl, you are sick,—soul and body; but no
                     one can do half as much for you as you can for yourself. The root of the evil
                     is in your mind, and medicine can't reach it. It is action you want,—healthful
                     action; exercise in the open air, with cheerful thoughts and pleasant company,
                     and then good wholesome food, such as beef and potatoes, baked apples and brown
                     bread."</p>
                  <p>There was an expression in Lena's large dark eyes, as she fixed them upon his
                     countenance, which seemed to say that she thought him a most worldly, gross,
                     and carnally-minded man. In her apprehension, the dignity of science suffered
                     greatly, when it was thus vulgarly associated with the common articles of
                     food.</p>
                  <p>"I don't want to live," she said slowly. "I had rather die than not;" and a
                     gush of tears prevented further utterance.</p>
                  <p>"Now, don't," said the doctor in a husky voice: "I never could bear to see a
                     woman cry. And yet, Lena, I tell you the plain truth. You have done altogether
                     too much dreaming. There's no use in trying to be a spirit before you get into
                     the right sphere for it. God placed us here to labor as well as think. He gave
                     us meat and drink for the support of the body; and he who neglects to supply
                     its need or bring its powers into action, must suffer the consequence, for it
                     will be accounted unto him a-sin. Lena, you have no right to die. God made you
                     to live; and if, through carelessness and indifference, you fail to do so, you
                     will neglect a solemn duty."</p>
                  <p>She regarded him for a moment with wonder and astonishment. "Haven't I a right
                     to die if I please?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>"No," said the doctor, very decidedly; "not the least. You are bound to live,
                     and do good both to yourself and others; and, if this duty is faithfully
                     performed, life will be a real pleasure to you."</p>
                  <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6310-00000142"/>
                  <p>Lena rose from the sofa, and drew herself up to her full height. Her face was
                     white as marble, and her lips quivered with emotion.</p>
                  <p>"Life a <emph>pleasure!</emph>" she repeated, in a tone of excitement. "A
                     pleasure to stand alone, without father or mother, brother or sister! to spend
                     sleepless nights and weary days! to yearn for sympathy, and find it not; and
                     smother in the depths of the soul a lava-tide of sorrow, which overflows and
                     withers up all the fair and lovely things in life! Oh! I tell you there is a
                     grief lies hidden here, deeper, darker, heavier than you can possibly
                     imagine."</p>
                  <p>"Doubtless some unhappy love-affair," said the doctor coolly, "which perhaps
                     exists more in your imagination than in reality. Lena, when you recover from
                     this, you will be perfectly ashamed of such talk."</p>
                  <p>A flush of indignation kindled upon her cheek, and she cast a withering glance
                     at the doctor.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, "how little can <emph>such</emph> people comprehend a
                     nature like mine!"</p>
                  <p>Completely overpowered by her emotions, she fell upon her knees; and, hiding
                     her face in the lap of her aunt, she wept passionately.</p>
                  <p>"O doctor!" said Mrs. Greenleaf reproachfully, "you are almost too bad. I
                     wouldn't have thought it of you. Hush, dear, hush!"</p>
                  <p>"No, no: let her cry," said the doctor, as he brushed away his own tears. "I
                     know such speech seems harsh and unkind; but it is like the sharp instrument of
                     the oculist, which removes the film from the blind eye."</p>
                  <p>Lena soon restrained her sobs, but it was some time before she rose from her
                     kneeling position. When she did, it was with a quiet and humbled expression.
                     She turned toward the doctor, and extended her hand.</p>
                  <p>"Dr. Purdie," she said, "you have told me the truth, and I thank you, though it
                     was hard to hear. I hope it will do me much good."</p>
                  <p>He seized her hand, while tears of sympathy stood in his eyes. "You are a good
                     girl," he said, "and I was quite sure you would do me justice. It was a bitter
                     medicine; but I was confident you would take it as it was intended. And now,
                     Lena, put on your bonnet, and go out for a walk. Not to the cemetery, however,
                     or into the woods; but along the borders of the brook, where it is both sunny
                     and shady, and the ripple of the water makes one feel cheerful."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Lena," added her aunt; "and, if you feel much fatigued, you had best stop
                     at Mrs. Ritchie's, and take tea: she will be so delighted! And then Mr. Ellery
                     will walk home with you if it is late."</p>
                  <p>Lena willingly accepted this advice; for, notwithstanding her reconciliation
                     with the doctor, she secretly dreaded him, and was glad to escape from his
                     presence.</p>
                  <p>"Thought without action is death, Mrs. Greenleaf," said the doctor, as the door
                     closed after Lena.</p>
                  <p>"Very true," replied the lady. "I don't know as I exactly understand you, but I
                     have no doubt it is so."</p>
                  <p>"It certainly <emph>is,</emph>" continued the doctor; "or, perhaps I should say
                     that it <emph>leads</emph> to death,—the death of the body. Just, for instance,
                     consider those children who are famed for precociousness and piety. See how the
                     little prim things seat themselves in a corner to read one of those
                     extensively-circulated tracts about some dear little Ellen or Edward, who was
                     too wise and good to<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6310-00000143"/> live, and
                     therefore died in early youth, to the inexpressible grief of surviving friends,
                     leaving an example worthy of imitation to the children of all coming
                     generations. Why, my dear Mrs. Greenleaf, such children don't live out half
                     their days; "or, if they do, the world, for them, is all east winds and April
                     showers. Now, it is my impression, that, before the death of Lena's parents,
                     she was subject to such influences."</p>
                  <p>"Very true," replied the widow. "Before she was fifteen she had read 'Young's
                     Night Thoughts' and 'Hervey's Meditations among the Tombs,' 'Dodd on Death,'
                     and"—</p>
                  <p>"Hold! hold!" interrupted the doctor. "That's quite enough. No wonder she has
                     fallen into this melancholy mood. Besides, in my opinion, it has been no slight
                     injury to her in attending Mr. Ellery's school. The man is 'tainted with
                     German;' and, between you and me, Mrs. Greenleaf, I may venture to say he
                     doesn't know as much as he might if he knew a little more."</p>
                  <p>"Very true," said the widow, drawing her chair a little nearer; "but Helena
                     seemed devoted to her study, and I can't tell you how many nights they have sat
                     here reading Schiller or Jean Paul together."</p>
                  <p>"They had much better been reading the Apostle Paul," said the doctor hastily,
                     "where he declares that he had rather speak 'five words' with his
                     'understanding' than 'ten thousand in an unknown tongue.' I don't like this
                     manner of educating the young: it's all false and superficial. Though, I must
                     confess, when I look at my own poor motherless children, I am quite at a loss
                     how to proceed." And he drew his chair closer to the widow. "I have excellent
                     theories, but find it hard to put them in practice. It needs a woman, a
                     kind-hearted woman, for such things. I believe they have a natural tact for
                     managing children: don't you, Mrs. Greenleaf?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, I don't know," said the widow modestly: "I've heard say so."</p>
                  <p>"When my wife died," continued the doctor, "Edward was just ready to enter
                     college. It is three years since then, and I expect he will be absent several
                     years longer, as he intends entering the Medical School; therefore he is no
                     present cause of anxiety to me: but my two youngest yet remain. They only need
                     care to make them good children; but I have no time to attend to them. Herbert
                     is awkward and careless, and Sarah Jane a perfect elf. This morning she took
                     her breakfast in the top of the cherry-tree; soon after, she was wading into
                     the pond in search of young turtles; and, the last I saw of her, she was riding
                     down to the village, without bonnet or shoes, on the rack of the stage-coach. I
                     must confess that such things trouble me exceedingly; and at times I feel it my
                     solemn duty to marry again, if I can find any one so kind or foolish as to have
                     me."</p>
                  <p>"Dr. Purdie," said the widow with a pleasant smile, "it is getting quite late.
                     I shall have supper ready in a short time; and I do hope you will stop and take
                     tea with me, for I should be delighted to <emph>have you.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Should you?" exclaimed the doctor, springing up and extending his hand, "then
                     I will <emph>have you</emph> with all my heart. So we will consider it a fair
                     bargain, and seal the compact."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>As Lena walked thoughtfully down the green and shady lane which communicated
                     with the main road, those words of the doctor, "Lena, you have done altogether
                     too much dreaming," returned in their full force. A flush of indignation and
                     wounded pride burned on her cheek, and her step quickened.</p>
                  <p>"I don't care for any one's opinion," she said, musingly. "Nobody understands
                     me, or ever will; but I know how I feel myself; and I can not help it while
                     there are so many causes."</p>
                  <p>A shout, and the sound of merry voices, arrested her attention; and, glancing
                     through the shrubbery that grew near the fence, she saw Mr. Ellery, the
                     schoolmaster, playing ball with some of the older boys on the village green.
                     Her path lay directly across this little common. She stopped where she was.</p>
                  <p>"I wouldn't meet him for the world," she said. "I wish I never could see him
                     again." And she pursued her walk another way.</p>
                  <p>It was now six months since Lena left school. At first, Mr. Ellery had
                     occasionally called in of an evening, and read German with her, which was her
                     favorite study; but ere long his visits grew less frequent, and at last were
                     wholly discontinued. To an imaginative and romantic girl, he was a very
                     attractive person, and Lena had become deeply interested in him; but she did
                     not understand character. He was fond of flirting with the ladies, and, being
                     fully conscious of his power, used it for his own amusement. When he became
                     tired of one, he turned to another, and, as is not uncommon with such general
                     favorites, was usually successful. When Lena was expecting him to call, she was
                     anxious and excited; and, if he failed to do so, a sleepless night and a pillow
                     wet with tears were the result. For a time, she struggled earnestly against
                     these feelings; but, at length, they gained supremacy, and she spent many hours
                     in dreams of love and happiness, which her sober senses told her could never be
                     realized. Her face grew pale and thin, and her step slow. Good Mrs. Greenleaf
                     marked the change, and was greatly troubled. Through mistaken kindness, she
                     would not suffer Lena to perform the slightest household duty. She kept her
                     from the air, tempted her appetite with various delicacies, and indulged her in
                     every whim which the diseased state of the girl's mind could suggest.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Ellery boarded with Lena's most intimate friend, Mrs. Ritchie. The time
                     was, when these ladies would not permit a day to pass without seeing each
                     other; but since the coming of the schoolmaster (through a sense of extreme
                     delicacy), Lena had almost wholly refrained from her visits. To-day, as she
                     came in sight of the house, she perceived her friend seated upon the doorstep,
                     sewing; while her little boy, a child of some six or seven years, was playing
                     near her.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ritchie was a young, active woman, very pretty and agreeable, and had a
                     peculiar faculty of making every thing go just as it should. There she sat,
                     dressed in a delicately-figured muslin, with her glossy brown hair arranged in
                     a most becoming manner, while the<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6310-00000145"/>
                     long gold pendals in her ears, and the tasteful pink bow that confined her
                     collar, seemed to give the finishing touch to her appearance.</p>
                  <p>"Why, Lena!" she exclaimed, as she looked up and recognized her friend. "Where
                     have you been all this time? I haven't seen you for a long while."</p>
                  <p>"I have been sick," said Lena mournfully; "and perhaps I should not have come
                     out to-day, if Dr. Purdie had not called, and urged me to take a walk."</p>
                  <p>"Dr. Purdie!" repeated Mrs. Ritchie, laughing. "Oh, the sly old rogue! He only
                     wanted to get clear of you, that he might make love to your aunt."</p>
                  <p>Lena looked up in astonishment. "What!" she exclaimed, "do you really think it
                     possible?"</p>
                  <p>"Possible? To be sure I do. Any one must be blind not to see that. Who do you
                     suppose it is that has walked home with your aunt from the Thursday-evening
                     conference, regularly, for these last six weeks? Ha, ha! Lena, you may be quite
                     sure of having the doctor for an uncle before long, and those two delightful
                     children for companions."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, dear! what shall I do?" said Lena, in a tone of utter despair. "That will
                     be the last drop in my bitter cup of sorrow. Herbert is intolerable, and Sarah
                     Jane the worst child I ever saw."</p>
                  <p>"So she is," interposed Master Arthur, whose attention had been arrested by the
                     name. "All the children call her 'Crazy Jane,' she acts so bad. She gets behind
                     the fences, and throws stones at us; and nobody can catch her, for she runs
                     faster than any boy in school."</p>
                  <p>He was about to enlarge still further upon the demerits of his sworn enemy, but
                     his mother restrained him.</p>
                  <p>"You must make the best of it, Lena," replied Mrs. Ritchie cheerfully. "It
                     isn't well to be too sensitive in such a world as this. You must take it
                     rough-and-tumble, just as it comes, and get all the good from it you can."</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Lena, after they had talked over the matter some time longer, "I
                     never shall be reconciled to the match; but I will try to bear it in
                     silence."</p>
                  <p>She turned with a heavy heart, and pursued her way along the quiet and shady
                     path by the brook. Ere long, she came to a large rock which jutted out from the
                     hillside. Here, wearied by her walk, she threw off her bonnet, and seated
                     herself in the shade of a great pine-tree. It was a very secluded spot, and
                     shut out from observation by the thick growth of shrubs and trees around. She
                     longed to relieve her aching heart by a gush of tears, and this seemed the very
                     place for it.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" she murmured, "was there ever such an unhappy creature in the world? I
                     know that I am desperately wicked, for sometimes I dare wonder why God made me
                     to suffer thus, or what I have done to deserve it. O father! dear father and
                     mother! can you see your poor orphan child, and take pity on her desolation? If
                     I have done wrong, show me the right, and help me to receive it."</p>
                  <p>Again those words of the doctor's, "Lena, you have done altogether too much
                     dreaming," were whispered by her troubled conscience; and then all the days and
                     hours she had wasted in idle dreaming and inactivity rose up in judgment
                     against her. She saw in the clear light of reason how foolishly she had
                     deceived herself, by craving, in the first place, an undue amount of
                        sympathy<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6310-00000146"/> pathy, and then by
                     construing every little friendly word and attention she had received from Mr.
                     Ellery into a token of far deeper feeling. She began to grow angry with
                     herself.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," she said, "Dr. Purdie told the truth, when he said the time would come
                     that I should be ashamed of all this; but he little thought how soon. I have
                     suffered these things to crush me down and make me miserable long enough; now I
                     will turn against them; and, even could the fondest desire of my heart be
                     granted, I would reject it, for I am resolved to 'conquer or die.' I will be a
                     dreamer no longer."</p>
                  <p>"Lena," said the well-known voice of Mr. Ellery, as he made his appearance
                     around a turn in the footpath, "what are you doing?—reciting Shakspeare or Don
                     Carlos?"</p>
                  <p>"Neither," she replied, with great composure, as she arose and put on her
                     bonnet.</p>
                  <p>There was an expression to her countenance which he had never before observed,
                     and just then he thought she appeared uncommonly dignified and interesting.</p>
                  <p>"Well," he continued, "I am a knight-errant, sent forth by your friend Mrs.
                     Ritchie, to secure the favor of your company at our evening meal; which request
                     I shall second with great earnestness, as to-morrow I depart for the West, and
                     know not how soon I shall enjoy such a pleasure again."</p>
                  <p>"I hardly think I shall accept the invitation," said Lena quietly. "I am in
                     rather too serious a mood to make my company agreeable to-night."</p>
                  <p>"Wayward one," said Mr. Ellery playfully, as he drew her hand into his arm,
                     "you tempt me to say that you are agreeable in any mood; and surely you will
                     not refuse almost the last request I can make of you."</p>
                  <p>Thus they walked along together, while the schoolmaster endeavored to make
                     himself uncommonly entertaining; but Lena's quiet, reserved manner was a great
                     puzzle to him: and when, in the course of conversation, she differed from him
                     in opinion, and defended her position with quite unanswerable arguments, he
                     wondered that she had never before appeared so interesting. At the urgent
                     request of Mrs. Ritchie, who met them at the door, she stopped to tea; and,
                     when she returned home, Mr. Ellery was very ready to accompany her. Lena was
                     still firm in her resolution; and the perplexed schoolmaster found it quite
                     impossible to understand the singular but pleasing change which had taken place
                     in her manner toward him. His admiration for her increased in proportion to her
                     quiet reserve. As they walked up the pleasant lane, shaded on either side by
                     locust-trees, there was a painful silence.</p>
                  <p>"Lena," said Mr. Ellery in a low tone, "we must part now, and to me it is no
                     easy task."</p>
                  <p>She took the hand which he had extended. "Good-by," she replied quietly: "may
                     God bless you!"</p>
                  <p>She had thrown back her bonnet from her head, and the moon shone full in her
                     face. He could trace no sign of deep emotion there; and he was much surprised,
                     for he had flattered himself that she loved him.</p>
                  <p>Moved by a sudden impulse, he threw his arms around her; and, pressing her to
                     his bosom with almost crushing force, he kissed her again and again. The next
                     moment he was gone.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <p>THAT great, and, to Helena, most trying event was at length consummated. Dr.
                     Pelham Purdie and Mrs. Patience Greenleaf were united in the holy bonds of
                     matrimony, and the seat of government was removed from No. 8, Main Street, to
                     the cottage in the lane. The advent of those two unruly children into the
                     hitherto quiet household was like the descent of the northern barbarians upon
                     ancient Rome. Herbert, although he invariably overturned and disarranged every
                     thing with which he came in contact, was possessed of quite a sense of
                     propriety; but his elfish sister ranged the house from top to bottom, like an
                     uncaged magpie, thrusting her head and hands into every sly nook or corner, and
                     freely inspecting all that appeared new or strange. Even Lena's chamber was not
                     free from her depredations. Closets were explored, drawers ransacked, and boxes
                     emptied of their contents; inkstands were overturned, sentimental poetry
                     twisted into lamplighters, and gaudy pictures, done in Prussian blue and
                     carmine, from a choice box of water-colors, ornamented the window-seat and
                     doors. A person of much greater patience and endurance than Lena would have
                     felt herself tried as by fire; but she had resolved to meet the ordeal bravely,
                     and was not easily discouraged. Indeed, she was glad to find a refuge from her
                     own thoughts, even in the midst of difficulties; for the parting scene with Mr.
                     Ellery haunted her like an unwelcome guest, and many a time she would have sat
                     down and dreamed it over again and again to her sorrow, had not the
                     circumstances around her called for constant and energetic action. At first,
                     she feared the doctor, for he seemed to keep his eye on her, and she felt
                     inwardly conscious that he could read her most secret thoughts; but, at last,
                     his unvarying kindness and good will won her confidence, and she talked with
                     him freely. He seemed to know precisely how to understand her; and though at
                     times she winced before the keen, sharp treatment which he bestowed upon some
                     of her mental ailments, she felt that he was a true and faithful friend. In her
                     endeavors for the right, there was a mighty struggle in her soul. Life seemed
                     dark and cold and dreary; but she had resolved to bear it without murmuring,
                     even though she could not enjoy it. Occasionally a newspaper would come from
                     Mr. Ellery, or a note claiming remembrance, which would send a thrill of joy
                     through her heart; but it was only for a moment. She put them all aside, and
                     turned her mind directly to her duties. She had undertaken the education of the
                     children, and it required her undivided attention. In spite of her endeavors,
                     Herbert would shuffle, and talk through his nose; and as for Sarah Jane, it was
                     like taming a March wind, or making friendly advances to a brier-bush. By
                     degrees, however, she secured a favorable influence, and at last became the
                     very center and mainspring of the children's enjoyment. Herbert would often sit
                     an hour at a time, gazing into her face with open mouth and earnest eyes, as if
                     vainly attempting to comprehend the secret of her goodness; while his sister
                     was almost as overwhelming and troublesome in her services of love as she had
                     been in her deeds of mischief.</p>
                  <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6310-00000148"/>
                  <p>Thus several years passed on, and the precious seed which Lena had sown with
                     weeping began to yield an abundant harvest. Her rosy cheeks and bright eyes
                     seemed to have a magical influence, and all who came within her sphere of
                     action rejoiced in the sunshine of her love.</p>
                  <p>One summer evening, just as the sun was withdrawing his last rays from the
                     earth, Lena sat with her work by Sarah's bedside. The poor child had been sick
                     with a fever, from which she had not entirely recovered. She had amused herself
                     about the house all day, but, growing very weary, had thrown herself upon the
                     bed, and begged Lena to sit beside her. Although she had become more gentle and
                     tractable, yet she was still ready for action at any moment. An unknown step
                     ascending the stairs aroused her. The next moment, little Arthur Ritchie's
                     smiling face, half hidden by flaxen curls, peeped in at the door.</p>
                  <p>"How are you, Crazy Jane?" he asked roguishly.</p>
                  <p>"Away with you!" exclaimed the weird child, as she seized a pillow, and
                     prepared to launch it at him.</p>
                  <p>He threw in a letter upon the floor, and, without a word of explanation, beat a
                     hasty retreat. Lena took it up. It was addressed to her, and she recognized the
                     handwriting of Mr. Ellery. She broke the seal, and read it with a smile. It
                     contained an offer of marriage, urged in a most eloquent manner. He said that
                     he had received such pleasing accounts of her from his friend Mrs. Ritchie,
                     that his feelings had become deeply interested; and now the dearest desire of
                     his heart was to win her to himself, as his future companion in the pilgrimage
                     of life.</p>
                  <p>"How strangely people alter!" said Lena thoughtfully, as she laid the letter on
                     the table. "Once I could not have craved a higher blessing; and now I have not
                     the slightest desire to accept it. Mr. Ellery appears very differently to me
                     from what he did when I was blinded by my own foolishness."</p>
                  <p>"Lena!" called out the doctor, who had just returned from the village, "will
                     you please come down one moment?"</p>
                  <p>She instantly obeyed the summons, and, upon entering the parlor below, was
                     somewhat abashed to find herself standing face to face with a tall, handsome
                     young man, an entire stranger.</p>
                  <p>"My son Edward," said the doctor, who evidently enjoyed her surprise; "and this
                     lady," he continued, turning to the young man, "is Miss Helena, of whom I have
                     so often written you. Though I, by election, am the head of this household, yet
                     she is the heart, and rules us all by the power of her love; therefore you,
                     also, will be expected to do her homage."</p>
                  <p>With courtly grace, Edward fell upon one knee, and kissed her hand in the most
                     deferential manner. Poor Lena received the honor very awkwardly, and was much
                     relieved when Herbert, who had just heard of his brother's arrival, came
                     shuffling into the room in great haste, while Sarah Jane, ever on the alert,
                     bounded down the stairs like a ball.</p>
                  <p>There was a joyful time in this little family-circle that night, and they did
                     not retire till a late hour. Edward had talked himself hoarse, and the children
                     were so much excited they could scarcely sleep. When all was still, Lena stood
                     by the window, with her head leaning<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6310-00000149"/>
                     against the casement, lost in thought, while the time sped on unheeded. At
                     length the sound of the clock striking twelve aroused her.</p>
                  <p>"Is it possible," she exclaimed, "that I have been dreaming all this time? And
                     so the old habit is yet strong upon me, and the enemy only waits for an
                     unguarded hour to enter his former dwelling-place. Poor orphan Helena! though
                     you have no foes without, there is a host within you must yet conquer."</p>
                  <p>She brushed away a falling tear as she kissed the cheek of the sleeping child
                     upon the bed, and then, with a prayer for strength and patience, lay down to
                     rest beside her.</p>
                  <p>Edward was to remain at home on a visit of several weeks, before he departed
                     for the town where he was to enter upon the duties of his profession. It was in
                     vain, however, during that time, that he sought the company of Helena. It was
                     evident that she avoided him. If he came into the parlor, she would slip into
                     the kitchen. When he entered the garden, she made her escape to the orchard,
                     ever vanishing before him like a spirit.</p>
                  <p>The doctor, who anxiously regarded her movements, grew very uneasy.</p>
                  <p>"Hang it!" he said to his wife, in his usual blunt way, "I am vexed with myself
                     for an old fool. The girl has learned her lesson far too well; and now she is
                     so much afraid of doing wrong, that she goes quite into the opposite extreme. I
                     wish her no ill: but I hope she will be seized with an affection of the
                        <emph>heart</emph> before another day, and will apply to me for medical
                     advice; I shall render it gratis, and will be most happy to do so."</p>
                  <p>But the good doctor was not kept in suspense much longer. One morning, as Lena
                     was alone in her chamber, the door was suddenly thrown open, and Sarah Jane
                     stood before her, with pouting lips, and tears of indignation in her eyes.</p>
                  <p>"I wish you would go down and scold at brother Edward," she exclaimed. "He is
                     unrolling all the lamplighters I made last night and placed in the parlor vase;
                     and, when I threatened to tell you if he did not stop directly, he said he
                     didn't care."</p>
                  <p>"What is he doing that for?" asked Lena carelessly.</p>
                  <p>"Why, he said he wanted to read your poetry."</p>
                  <p>"My poetry!" exclaimed Lena. "What <emph>have</emph> you done?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, I only used those old pieces of paper you threw out of your desk last
                     night, and said you should kindle the fire with in the morning."</p>
                  <p>"Dear me!" said Lena, greatly confused: "I shall go down and take them away
                     from him immediately."</p>
                  <p>"I wish you would," said the child in high glee, who anticipated quite an
                     active conflict.</p>
                  <p>Lena threw the remainder of the flowers into the child's lap, and ran down
                     stairs in great haste. As she entered the room, Edward stood by the fireplace,
                     with his attention riveted upon the piece of crumpled paper which he held in
                     his hand. Lena glanced over his shoulder, and recognized a poem in her own
                     handwriting. It was the same unfinished page over which she was bending when we
                     first-introduced her to the reader.</p>
                  <p>"Pray don't read that, Edward," she said, entreatingly, as she placed her hand
                     over the words. But, instead of minding her, he imprisoned the little hand
                        in<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6310-00000150"/> his own; and, holding the
                     paper above her head, he repeated the last stanza aloud:— <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"In those few words, my stricken heart</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">Makes all its sorrows known;</l>
                           <l>Unloved, unblest, I stand apart,—</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">Alone! all, all alone!"</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Lena," he asked, "how long is it since you wrote this most melancholy
                     poem?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! it is a great many years," she replied; "and now that I have overcome such
                     feelings, I am perfectly ashamed of it."</p>
                  <p>She bowed her head to conceal her blushes from Edward's inquiring gaze. He
                     gently lowered his arm; and, as it encircled her waist, he drew her close to
                     his side.</p>
                  <p>"Lena," he whispered, "you must stand 'alone' no longer."</p>
                  <p>"Have you conquered him?" cried out Sarah Jane, as she flew down the stairs in
                     eager haste, and rushed into the room.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, little sis," replied Edward. "She has gained a complete victory, and
                     henceforth I shall become her most willing subject; for only they know how to
                     triumph who have first learned to conquer themselves."</p>

                  <p>COME in, ye poor soul," said Janet, the fisherman's wife, as she opened the
                     door of her cottage, 'midst the driving storm, to welcome the stranger who had
                     knocked for admittance: "come in; and, though ours is but a humble roof, you'll
                     find it a safe, warm shelter."</p>
                  <p>The stranger entered; and, as he advanced to the fire which was burning
                     cheerfully upon the hearth, he drew from beneath his mantle of coarse highland
                     plaid a harp, which he had carefully shielded from the storm. Placing it beside
                     him, he seated himself upon a low, wooden stool, and covered his face with his
                     hands. Janet regarded him with a curious eye.</p>
                  <p>"It's wet and cold ye are," she said: "besides that, ye are young, and not over
                     strong, to bear the beating of these storms. Gin ye'll move a bit nearer the
                     fire, ye'll soon warm, while I wring the wet from your plaidie. Is it far ye've
                     traveled to-day?"</p>
                  <p>"Not far,—only from the next town."</p>
                  <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6310-00000151"/>
                  <p>"The next town! Ay, and did ye not meet my good man, with Jessie and our little
                     Robbie? Poor Robbie! it's blind he is. They've gone thither; and, gin the storm
                     does not rave too wild, they'll be back tonight. Did ye see aught of them?"</p>
                  <p>"I do not recollect of meeting any one. Perhaps they passed me while I lay
                     asleep in the wood."</p>
                  <p>"Asleep in the wood, poor soul! And have ye no better home or resting-place
                     than the lonely wild wood, and that in a land of praying Christians? Stay with
                     us to-night. I will bake you a nice bannock of barley meal, and you shall have
                     milk, with good butter and cheese, to your heart's content. Say, will ye?"</p>
                  <p>The stranger shook his head. "I must be at the castle on the mountain
                     to-night," said he.</p>
                  <p>Janet raised her hands and eyes in astonishment. "Gin ye would not have
                     dealings with the divil, ye'll not go to Castle Roseburn. A bad name it has:
                     ay, a <emph>worse</emph> than bad name."</p>
                  <p>"And how did it come by its evil reputation?"</p>
                  <p>"What! don't you know the story? Then I'll tell it ye. You must know, that,
                     years agone, a lord and his lady lived there. He was a grim and lowering
                     carlin; and she—ay, she was a sweet angel, who had stolen away from the
                     heavenly places to pour out the sunshine of her loving heart upon the dark spot
                     where it was most needed. And that's the way true-hearted women always ought to
                     love! But they've grown so selfish, now-a-days, that they only love where they
                     have the like again."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes; but your story. Are you sure <emph>he</emph> loved
                     <emph>her?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Sure? If I should say the ocean loved the rock round which it plays and foams
                     for ever, or the blue heaven loved the stars that glist and glimmer in its
                     bosom, it would be a little thing to tell you how much he loved her. But yet
                     there was a bitterness in his love; for he was jealous of the very light of
                     heaven that shone upon her countenance and the winds that kissed her cheeks.
                     There came lords and ladies to the castle, and gallant knights from afar: and
                     the sweet lady laughed, danced, and sung with them, while her lord looked so
                     grim, that, when she met his gaze, it seemed to wither her very soul; and all
                     felt chilled in his presence. Then the lords and ladies forgot to come, and the
                     knights staid away. The old castle was lonely and still, save when the lofty
                     walls echoed back the step of their stern lord, or the sorrowing song of the
                     sad lady. Darker still grew the brow of her lord, for he feared she was pining
                     for some of her old admirers. Harsh and unkind he was to her, for a time; and
                     then he left her, day after day, to tears and bitter loneliness."</p>
                  <p>"And was she <emph>all</emph> alone? Was there <emph>none</emph> to comfort
                     her?"</p>
                  <p>"Ay, all alone, save old Margery and her husband, who dwelt by the gate. But
                     our kind Lord took pity on her, and shortly gave into her arms a little son.
                     Oft have I held the bonnie wee thing; and when I saw the mother's smile, as she
                     whispered the hope that the child might bring back the heart of her lord to her
                     once more, I thanked Heaven for its blessed gift. And mayhap, for a time,
                     things were better. But then they grew a great deal worse; for the life and
                     soul of the<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6310-00000152"/> father seemed to be
                     bound up in the son; and, as soon as he could run alone, he took him wholly to
                     himself: for he said the boy must be brought up under his own care, lest he
                     should become as false-hearted as his mother. May God forgive him for such evil
                     speech!"</p>
                  <p>"And what did the mother do then?"</p>
                  <p>"Do! ay, her heart was nigh to breaking, and her brain was wild. Love is the
                     life of a woman's heart; but her child! ay, God, in his great wisdom, has made
                        <emph>that</emph> all the same as her heart itself. I have heard her till
                     midnight, upon her bended knees, beseeching that cruel, unfeeling man to give
                     her back the child; yet all in vain. Then her reason quite forsook her. Not
                     that she was a raving maniac, but sort o' wandering like, with strange freaks
                     and fancies; and one day, as John, my own good man, was fishing by the lake, he
                     heard a low, sweet singing; and, looking up, he saw the poor dear soul kneeling
                     upon the rock that over-looks the lake on the other side. She was dropping down
                     flowers, one by one, a-singing that sad tune; when, all at once, she stopped
                     and looked steadfastly into the water. Then she stretched out her arms with a
                     loving cry, and, calling the name of her child, she plunged into the lake. Oh!
                     could ye but have seen that lily-white face, and those bonnie locks dropping
                     with wet, as they drew her up from her cold resting-place, ye would have cursed
                     the man who had broken such a true heart."</p>
                  <p>"Will you give me a cup of water?" said the stranger, as he leaned faintly
                     against the wall.</p>
                  <p>"And what became of the father and son?" he asked, as he gave the cup back into
                     her hand.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! it was not long he could dwell in such an uncanny place: for Margery has
                     told me, that, every night, the ghost of the poor lady went weeping and wailing
                     through the castle; and when the mists were on the lake, and clouds across the
                     moon, she would often sit on the Lady Rock, and sing that same low song. The
                     lord took his son, and went away into foreign lands. There he died; and the boy
                     has been a wanderer ever since. I saw the child just before he left. He was but
                     a few months older than my Jessie. She was a lilting, laughing girl; but he had
                     a thoughtful look, as though there was sorrow in his heart. He was madly fond
                     of music; yet they were all sad songs he sung. Poor soul! It's a hard thing for
                     a child to grow up without a tender mother's love."</p>
                  <p>The young minstrel rose up, and leaned upon his harp with such a strange, wild
                     look, that Janet was frightened. "What ails ye now?" she said: "ye should not
                     take my simple story so sorely to heart."</p>
                  <p>"Janet," he replied, "I am Eric, the son of the lord of Roseburn! You have
                     truly said, it is a hard thing for a child to grow up without a tender mother's
                     love. The shadow that fell upon my childhood has never been removed. I am
                     without father or mother, brother or sister, and no home save yonder moldering
                     pile."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, dear, dear!" cried Janet, as she wrung her hands in agony: "this will kill
                     me quite. Stay with us, poor child, and I will be a mother to ye. Jessie, the
                     darling, will be a true and loving sister; and gin ye'll make music on your
                     harp, ye will be like an angel of light to little Robbie. Poor Robbie! it's
                     blind he is."</p>
                  <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6310-00000153"/>
                  <p>Eric answered her not. He only pressed her hand closely in his own; then,
                     taking his harp, he drew his mantle across his face, and hurried forth once
                     more into the storm.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>SPRING had tipped the dark fir-boughs with a brighter green, and filled the air
                     with the fragrance of buds and blossoms; silvery cascades were leaping down the
                     mountain-side, to join the waters of the lake; and from banks and braes and
                     birchen glens came up the melody of birds and the hum of busy insects. Lonely
                     and sad at heart, Eric came forth from the home of his fathers, and wandered in
                     the shadow of the pine-wood. As he carelessly strayed, he came, ere he was
                     aware, to the Lady Rock. The unclouded brightness of the azure sky was mirrored
                     in the placid bosom of the lake, undisturbed by a ripple, save where the wild
                     swan sailed gracefully from some green inlet, or the swallow skimmed across
                     with glancing wing. Beauty and silence, like the watching cherubim above the
                     mercyseat, seemed to meet here; and, as the sad wanderer caught the harp-like
                     melody of the winds among the quivering leaves, an indescribable sense of
                     loneliness, and a yearning for love and the innocent pleasures of childhood,
                     came over his soul. The hallowed name of mother was on his lips; and, as he
                     leaned upon his harp, such tears as little children weep gushed from his eyes.
                     Suddenly he heard the sound of voices; and, not wishing to be observed, he
                     withdrew into the wood.</p>
                  <p>"Now let me go alone, Jessie," said a sweet, childish voice; "for I shall not
                     fall. Here I am in the sunshine, and now in the shadow; and here I smell the
                     hawthorne blossoms. O bonnie hawthorne! What makes you stoop, and kiss me on
                     the cheek so softly? Is it because you are glad to see me this fine spring
                     morning?"</p>
                  <p>"Be careful, Robbie dear: ye are so birdie-like in your gait, that ye scarce
                     set down your foot before you take it up again. Now we have come to the Lady
                     Rock; and you may stop and gather flowers among the grass, while I pull a few
                     more fagots from the pinewood yonder."</p>
                  <p>"And will ye run away and leave me, Jessie dear?" said the child playfully:
                     "then kiss me before you go;" and, clasping his arms around her neck, he kissed
                     her again and again. There were tears in Jessie's soft, meek eyes, as she put
                     back the golden tresses of the blind boy, and returned his loving caress. She
                     unloosed the little blue kerchief that confined her own silken locks; and,
                     giving it to Robbie, she turned toward the pine-wood, to add a few more fagots
                     to the bundle which she carried in her apron. As the child crept hither and
                     thither, feeling carefully for the flowers, Eric struck a few notes upon his
                     harp. With a cry of delight the child started to his feet; and, as he again
                     heard the sound, he sprang forward to the edge of the rock. "Robbie dear!"
                     shrieked Jessie, as she saw his danger; but, before she could reach him, Eric's
                     arm had interposed and saved him.</p>
                  <pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6310-00000154"/>
                  <p>With lips white with terror, and eyes filled, with surprise, Jessie started
                     back at the sudden appearance of the stranger; and then, as if forgetful of all
                     beside, she clasped the dear child in her arms, and the tears gushed from her
                     eyes in a silvery shower. "Why, Robbie, darling! Did ye not know ye were close
                     upon the edge of the rock, and would have fallen, had it not been for this kind
                     one who came to save you?"</p>
                  <p>"But the <emph>music!</emph>" said the child, as he trembled and shook with
                     excitement: "oh, the <emph>music!</emph> I could not think of any thing
                     else."</p>
                  <p>"It's not strange, sir," said Jessie timidly, "that he is so wild about music.
                     The voice of an angel could not startle him more than the sound of a
                     harp-string. He can not see the beautiful <emph>sights</emph> around him:
                     therefore he is the more listful to the beautiful <emph>sounds.</emph> Poor
                     Robbie! it's blind he is."</p>
                  <p>"Blind!" repeated Eric thoughtfully, as he knelt beside the child and gazed
                     into his cheerful countenance; "<emph>blind!</emph> and <emph>happy</emph> too!
                     How strange! <emph>My</emph> eyes are open to behold light and beauty. I can go
                     where I please, with none to lead me; and whenever I will, I can touch my
                     harp-strings and listen to their melody: but <emph>I</emph> am not happy. It is
                     because I am alone. The light comes to my eyes, but there is darkness in my
                     heart. Yes: I am <emph>all</emph> alone, with none to love me."</p>
                  <p>"Is it the young lord of the castle?" whispered Robbie. Jessie silently pressed
                     his hand.</p>
                  <p>"No: you are <emph>not</emph> alone," said the child, as he clapsed his arms
                     around his neck, and laid his soft cheek to his; "for Robbie loves you, and so
                     does Jessie. She will be a kind sister to you, as she is to me; for she loves
                     everybody. I should die without her; for it's her that makes every thing bright
                     for me: and did she lead you by the hand as she does me, you would be happy
                     too." And, before either could think, he laid Eric's hand in Jessie's, and
                     kissed them both.</p>
                  <p>Eric's eyes were fixed with a searching gaze upon the face of the timid girl,
                     as, blushing and trembling, she withdrew her hand. He rose to his feet; and
                     pointing to the castle, whose old time-worn battlements rose frowning and gray
                     above the pine-wood, he said, "Yonder is my home. It is lone and cheerless as
                     the grave: no kind heart awaits me there, no voice of love echoes through its
                     halls. The bright star which would have guided me in my pathway—the blessed
                     light which would have gladdened and cheered my young heart—is quenched for
                     ever in these waves. The name of mother is a strange word to my lips, and my
                     childhood was desolate. I have wandered in foreign lands; I have been in the
                     palaces of emperors and the courts of kings; but that which I most coveted and
                     sought after, I found not. And I have learned, at length, that neither wealth
                     nor rank, fame nor glory, can purchase the high and holy gift of love; for,
                     with all these, there is none to call me friend or brother."</p>
                  <p>"An' it's not in the court or palace that love may be found," said Jessie
                     earnestly; "for it's a hardy plant, that flourishes in frost and storm. Sorrow
                     and suffering, and daily need, is what binds human hearts the closest. Nor yet
                     is it always in the cottage of the poor man; for, after all, the blessing is
                     more in <emph>loving</emph> than in <emph>being loved.</emph> And he who gives
                     out from his own<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6310-00000155"/> heart's fullness to
                     any thing in God's creation calls down Heaven's own sunshine upon his soul.
                     It's a woful thing, indeed, for one to stand alone in this world, without kith
                     or kin; but alas for the human heart that has never <emph>loved!</emph>" And,
                     as she spoke, her eye brightened, and the flush deepened on her cheek. She was
                     no longer the bashful, shrinking girl, but the high-souled, thoughtful woman:
                     for the truth to which, in the simplicity and earnestness of her heart, she had
                     given utterance, had shed its hallowing beauty upon her countenance; and, as
                     she stood in the changing light that glimmered through the birches, she seemed,
                     to the sad minstrel who listened to her words, like the living, beautiful image
                     of his own soul's ideal of love and goodness. She ceased speaking; and, as she
                     gathered up her fagots, she called to the child, "Come, Robbie dear, it's time
                     we were going; for the dinner will not boil without the fagots, and mother will
                     weary a waiting for us." Once more she turned her sweet, radiant eyes upon
                     Eric, as she bade him a cheerful "Good-morning;" and, clasping her arm around
                     the blind boy, together they descended the mountain-path.</p>
                  <p>"May holy angels be with you and bless you!" murmured Eric, as he watched them
                     on their way. The beautiful vision that had haunted him in his dreams had stood
                     before him a blessed reality. With her magic words she had awakened the finest
                     chords of his being, and filled his whole soul with harmony. What wonder, then,
                     that his spirit followed after her in love, and his lips blessed her? Alas for
                     the human heart that can not love thus!</p>

                  <p>CASTLE ROSEBURN, situated as it was upon the mountain-side, overlooked all the
                     surrounding country, and afforded a fine view of the neighboring islands, and
                     the sea which fretted and foamed at the eastern base of the mountain. Here
                     would Eric stand in the old moldering tower, while the wild storms, which so
                     often beat upon these bleak northern isles, lashed the sea in their fury, and
                     made the old castle tremble; and, as he watched the mad revelings of the
                     tempest, his own soul would "become a sharer in its fierce and far delight."
                     Strange melodies would ring from his harp-strings, and his own song would
                     mingle with the howling of the storm.</p>
                  <p>It was thus he stood, in his lonely retreat, upon a midsummer day, and watched
                     the gathering storm. It was one of those dark tempests that lift up their
                     shadowy fronts in silence and gloom, and, when their forces are fully gathered,
                     burst forth at once in unbounded fury. The heavy clouds, as they rolled up
                     their dark, uneven edges, along which the lightning played at intervals, were
                     mirrored in the calm surface of the seas, where a tiny sail, a lone fisher's
                     boat, was flying like a frightened bird before the storm. Eric was watching her
                     progress, when an object of still deeper interest attracted his attention. It
                     was Jessie, the fisherman's daughter. She was seated upon a rock, with her
                     long, dark hair resting loosely upon her shoulders; and, with<pb n="310-311"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000156"/> her hands raised above her eyes, she, too,
                     seemed to be watching the approach of the little boat. Eric well knew it
                     contained her father, and that she was anxiously awaiting his return. Without a
                     moment's delay, he left the tower, and began to descend the mountain, in order
                     to join her.</p>
                  <p>As he clambered up the steep rock on which she was seated, and stood by her
                     side, Jessie slightly turned her head. She recognized him; and, pointing toward
                     the boat, she said in a low tone, as if she spoke unconsciously, "See! they are
                     both there, father and little Robbie. Poor Robbie! it's blind he is. May Heaven
                     shield the dear lamb!" As she spoke, a dazzling flash of lightning broke
                     through the gloom, succeeded by a heavy peal of thunder. There was a murmuring
                     and rushing in the air; and then, like unchained furies, the winds burst forth,
                     lashing the waves into foam. "O merciful Father, spare them!" exclaimed Jessie,
                     as she sprang to her feet, and clasped her hands. Again the little boat
                     appeared on the white crest of the waves, and then vanished in the dark flood.
                     Another flash, and it revealed the fisherman clinging to the shivered mast,
                     holding the child closely to his bosom. Jessie turned her pale face with an
                     imploring look to Eric, as she pointed toward them, and sank down at his feet.
                     He raised the fainting girl in his arms, and bore her from the rock.</p>
                  <p>Janet, whose anxiety would not allow her to remain in the cottage, met them;
                     and, leaving Jessie in her care, Eric hastened to the more open shore. As he
                     gazed anxiously into the boiling flood, he thought he heard a shout; and the
                     next moment he descried the form of the brave fisherman close at hand. It was
                     in vain that he attempted to grasp him, for the receding wave carried him far
                     beyond his reach; but, as it again advanced, he watched his opportunity, and,
                     dashing fearlessly forward, he seized him and dragged him to the shore. Though
                     fainting with his exertions, and bruised by the rocks, the fisherman still
                     retained his consciousness; but the child lay motionless and still upon his
                     bosom. Eric laid his hand on his heart, but no pulsation or sign of life was
                     there. He took him gently in his arms; and, with the mother and daughter, they
                     all proceeded to the cottage. It was in vain that they kindled the fire upon
                     the hearth, and strove to restore life and animation once more. The tender
                     spirit had flown, and the lips were sealed for ever.</p>
                  <p>"It is too late!" said Eric, as he laid him on his little bed; and then, as he
                     remembered the loving words of the child, and with what confidence he had
                     clasped his arms around his neck and kissed him on the Lady Rock, it seemed as
                     though some bright and beautiful thing, which had just found a place in his
                     heart, and claimed his love, was taken from him; and he, too, wept.</p>
                  <p>"Poor child!" said the old fisherman: "I tried hard to save him; and, when I
                     was buffeting the waves so hopelessly, I would sooner have perished myself than
                     have loosed my hold on him. O Janet! it's many a hard thing we've seen since we
                     walked the way of life together, but this seems the sorest trial of all! One by
                     one, the little ones that have gathered around our table have been taken, and
                     now this is all that is left to us." He laid his trembling hand upon Jessie's
                        head:<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6310-00000157"/> but when he gazed into her
                     pale, sweet face, his words of mourning were changed into thanksgiving; and,
                     lifting up his voice, he blessed God that she was yet spared to them.</p>
                  <p>"And long may I live to love and bless you!" said Jessie, as she took their
                     hands in her own. "Oh! it was the richest gift that the Holy Father could
                     bestow, when he gave poor blind Robbie into my care; for the more I watched
                     over him, the dearer I loved him, while my heart was made wiser and better for
                     it. And now that the angels are leading the loved child up to the heavenly
                     places, I will be more faithful and true to the dear ones that are left
                     me."</p>
                  <p>Silently and reverently, in the depths of his soul, did Eric acknowledge her
                     purity and goodness, as she gave utterance to these words of earnest affection;
                     and, though standing apart, he seemed to feel the sweet influences of her
                     spirit. Oh that the sunshine of her love might fall upon his heart! He could
                     not bear the rush of contending feelings: he feared they were written on his
                     countenance; and, bowing down his head, he kissed the pale cheek of the child,
                     and silently left the cottage.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                  <p>IN a lone and quiet nook, open to the western light, and shaded only by larch
                     and silvery birch-trees, was the grave of the little blind boy. A plain white
                     cross, with the simple inscription, "Robbie," was all that marked the spot.
                     Here, morning and evening, would Jessie come, and, watering the sod with her
                     tears, would sing the sweet songs the child so loved to hear. Often, when she
                     came, she would find the cross hung with garlands, and fresh flowers scattered
                     onthe grave. She well knew whose was the kind hand that did this, and in her
                     heart she blessed him.</p>
                  <p>One mild summer evening, while the rosy rays of the setting sun yet lingered on
                     the woods of Roseburn Castle, she stole away to this quiet spot, and seated
                     herself by the grave. "Dear Robbie!" she said, as she laid her face upon the
                     sod, "I did not think you would die so soon. When we wandered by the sea and on
                     the mountain-side, with your soft hand in mine, I did not think that now you
                     would be resting, cold and still, in the grave. The robin sings all the same at
                     sunset, and Roseburn woods are full of summer flowers. Yet it's lonely and sad
                     I am, without you, Robbie; for though I've set the memory of you close in my
                     heart, yet I'm yearning sadly to see your face."</p>
                  <p>A light footstep startled her; and, raising her head, Eric stood by her side.
                     "Jessie," he said, "I do not mean to intrude upon your grief, but I, too, loved
                     little Robbie. He was the first who called me brother; and oft, as I stand by
                     this little grave, I think, that, could I have carried the simplicity and
                     innocence of childhood into my riper years, it would have been worth more to me
                     than the wisdom of sages. His gentle spirit seems to hallow this spot, and
                     therefore do I love to seek it."</p>
                  <p>"Blessings on ye!" said Jessie, "for saying that ye loved our Robbie; and
                     blessings on ye, too, for saving<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6310-00000158"/> our
                     father from the hungry waves! It was not well for us to let you pass from under
                     our roof without saying one grateful word; but, when our hearts were grieving
                     so sorely for our bonnie bird, we could not well think of aught else. Jessie
                     has nothing to give you, save her blessing; and she is content to leave you
                     with that, for well she knows that the joy of doing good is a rich reward."</p>
                  <p>"Nay," said Eric, "Jessie has yet more to give. She has a blessing that I
                     humbly crave. The sweet child that she loved so well walks with the angels in
                     Paradise, while sad and alone Jessie treads the way of life. Will she not lead
                     another by the hand, as she once led the blind boy, and guide him, from the
                     mists and shadows that now darken his soul, into the clear sunshine of
                     love?"</p>
                  <p>"An' if that's what ye would ask of me, may God forgive me if I grant it not!
                     Oh! if there is any thing that such a poor simple girl as I can do, by loving
                     and serving you, that will make you look more cheerfully upon life, and lift up
                     your soul from sorrow, I will gladly do it. I will set you side by side with
                     Robbie in my heart, and will be as true and loving a sister to you as I was to
                     him."</p>
                  <p>As she spoke, she lifted up her eyes with such a truthful, earnest look, that
                     he knew she had spoken sincerely. He answered her not, but gazed steadfastly
                     upon her face, until he saw, by her changing glance, and deepening color, that
                     his eyes had spoken the language of his heart.</p>
                  <p>"The love of a sister," he said, "is indeed holy and beautiful, and I would not
                     take it from those to whom it rightfully belongs: let Robbie still hold his
                     place in your heart. But there is a pure, deep, mysterious love, that unites
                     two human hearts as one; and, where this union is true and perfect, life always
                     seems cheerful, and sorrow and trouble and trial lose their bitterness. I know
                     you are much too timid to understand me, Jessie, or, if you did, to say so:
                     therefore, if your heart tells you that you can love me thus, just lay your
                     hand in mine, and it will be all the same as spoken."</p>
                  <p>For a moment Jessie sat gazing thoughtfully upon the ground, while the great
                     tears, she knew not why, stole down her cheeks. Then she raised her eyes with a
                     look of trust and confidence, and laid her hand in his, with a warm, earnest
                     clasp, as though she feared not to trust her weal and woe with him. Life's
                     purest fountains of truth and love, upspringing from the depths of each heart,
                     met and mingled; and in the sight of God and angels they were ONE.</p>

               <p>SOFT and clear, as it falls on Italian plains, fell the silent moonlight on the
                  rude old towers of Castle Löwenherz. Deep moats, lofty battlements, massive gates,
                  lonely towers, where the winds shrieked through the deserted chambers like
                  troubled spirits, and moldering turrets mantled with ivy, where the bats found
                  shelter by day, and the owls hooted at midnight,—thus it stood, a fitting emblem
                  of the departed glory of the ancient house of Löwenherz. Those burly old Norsemen,
                  who once smote with their spears upon their shields, and made the spacious halls
                  ring with their shouts of victory, now slumbered peacefully in the vaults of the
                  castle; and the only representatives left of the noble line were the brave old
                  Baron Rodolph, and his son Gottlieb. Around were the dark pine forests swaying to
                  and fro in the moonlight, and beyond were the snow-capped mountains, rising peak
                  above peak, till their summits were lost in the clouds.</p>
               <p>In the midst of these mountain solitudes, in a wild spot, seldom visited by the
                  foot of man, was the Elfin Spring. Its crimson waters, gushing up from the midst
                  of tangled roots and broken rocks, forced themselves over the uneven way, till
                  they fell in a miniature cascade into a deep basin, which, although without
                  seeming outlet, never overflowed the brink. Around it were the Alpine flowers
                  blooming in unseen beauty, huge stones covered with soft green moss, and stately
                  pines filling the air with solemn music. And yet, wild and beautiful and
                  enchanting as was this quiet spot, superstition had connected with it such a
                  singular tradition, that it was carefully avoided. It was related, that Baron
                  Herkules, one of the noble race of Lion-hearts, was a great hunter. In one of his
                  excursions, he chased a gazelle to this lonely spot, where as yet no fountain had
                  burst. Here he met with Elfrida, the daughter of the Elfin King. Enchanted with
                  her beauty, he sought her for his bride. To this the Elves strongly objected,
                  unless he should first, with solemn oath, renounce his faith in God, and swear
                  allegiance to Satan. The price was great, but the baron's passion was much
                  greater. He hesitated for a time, and then yielded, secretly resolving, if Satan
                  proved too hard a master, to give him battle.</p>
               <p>Upon the night of the New Year, all the spirits of earth and air had gathered to
                  the bridal; when, to the surprise of all, Schwarz, the Black Spirit of the
                  Mountains, made a descent upon them with a company of Ice-giants, and declared the
                  ceremony should not<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6310-00000160"/> proceed, as he had
                  not been properly consulted in the matter. An altercation ensued between him and
                  the bridegroom elect. Baron Herkules, drawing his dagger, rushed upon the Black
                  Spirit; but he cunningly avoided him, and the dagger was plunged deep in the heart
                  of Elfrida. She was immediately changed into a rock, and from the wound gushed
                  forth a stream of mingled blood and water. The Elves and Ice-giants vanished in a
                  whirlwind of fury; and Baron Herkules, left alone to his love and despair, threw
                  himself into the basin of the fountain, and was never heard of more. From thence
                  he became the ghostly proprietor of the fountain; and it is said that he who
                  drinks of those waters is filled with a most wonderful courage, and a wisdom that
                  understands all mysteries; but, in his heart, the name of God is a forgotten word
                  for ever.</p>
               <p>Gottlieb, the youngest of the Lion-hearts, now stood alone by the fountain. Pale,
                  and slight in form, with his hair falling in heavy ringlets upon his shoulders, he
                  bore little resemblance to the portraits of his grim old ancestors, that adorned
                  the castle walls; but the flashing of his eye and lofty bearing told that the
                  ancient blood was yet leaping like fire through his veins. He knelt beside the
                  fountain, and, plunging his hand in the waters, pressed it passionately to his
                  brow and lips. "Herkules!" he cried. "Dread Spirit, hear me! I am the last of the
                  Lion-hearts; but an evil genius cursed me in the elements of being. See here! this
                  woman's face and hand, and with them all the wild, proud blood of our ancient race
                  is bubbling up like a hot geyser in my heart. My spirit chafes like a caged lion,
                  and threatens, in the strife, to batter down these walls of clay, and rise once
                  more into that boundless element from which it came. Oh, give me freedom, give me
                  life! I watch the red light on the mountain-tops, and hear the shepherd's pipes
                  calling the flocks to pasture. Through the long, long day, I see the woods and
                  hills, the glaciers gleaming from the rifted mountain-tops, and the wide-arching
                  sky, in one eternal sameness; and at night I hear the shepherd's pipes calling the
                  flocks from pasture, the hum of children's voices, the echo of a vesper hymn, and
                  then all is still. Thus I dream, dream on, while the deep fires within me burn and
                  rage, and feed upon the very sources of my being. Oh! I had rather be an eagle
                  soaring in the glorious light of day, a meteor flashing through the midnight, or a
                  majestic pine to battle with the storms, and shout a welcome to the spirits that
                  hide among my branches. Thus have I sought this fount, and, in my madness,
                  something whispers, 'Drink! ay, <emph>drink!</emph> though with your woe and
                  weakness you forget all else beside.'"</p>
               <p>"Well said, young Lion-heart!" cried a loud voice.</p>
               <p>Gottlieb sprang to his feet; and, turning, he beheld a tall stranger, clad in dark
                  garments, standing near him; but the shadow that fell from the heavy crest of
                  plumes that adorned his hat entirely concealed his features.</p>
               <p>"Who are you? and why are you here?" asked Gottlieb, in a haughty tone.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me," replied the stranger courteously, at the same time removing his hat,
                  and revealing in the clear moonlight a broad forehead, white as polished marble,
                  beneath which glittered a pair of eyes so deep and fiery they seemed to wither at
                  a glance,—"I am Rupert Schwarz; and I came hither to get a drink from yonder
                  fountain."</p>
               <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6310-00000161"/>
               <p>"Then be you welcome," said Gottlieb, stepping aside.</p>
               <p>The stranger advanced, and taking a cup from his bosom, thrice he filled it, and
                  thrice he drained it dry. "Ha! this is better than wine of France!" he exclaimed;
                  and, filling the cup again, he offered it to Gottlieb. He caught the glance of the
                  stranger's eye, and waved the cup aside. "No!" he said: "when I wish to drink of
                  yonder fountain, I will help myself."</p>
               <p>"You are afraid," said Schwarz, smiling scornfully.</p>
               <p>"Afraid!" shouted Gottlieb furiously, as he plucked his dagger from his sheath:
                  "who dares say that Gottlieb Löwenherz is afraid?"</p>
               <p>"I do," coolly replied Schwarz.</p>
               <p>For some moments they stood like two lions at bay, with their eyes fixed intently
                  on each other's countenances.</p>
               <p>"Young man," continued Schwarz, "restrain your passion. I doubt not your valiant
                  spirit; but you are afraid of being strong and wise,—afraid of the idle
                  superstition that hangs about this fountain."</p>
               <p>"Never! I would renounce all that I now possess of hope and joy in life, if I
                  might loose my untried energies, and rise, with giant power and intellect, above
                  my fellow-men. But beyond this life is darkness; and the solemn question stands
                  before us, What is it to forget one's God?"</p>
               <p>"God! God!" repeated Schwarz, and burst into a laugh which was given back by the
                  wild echoes, like the voices of kindred spirits.</p>
               <p>"It is the hallowed name of the All-Father, Creator of men and angels."</p>
               <p>"A great delusion, rather! What said that noble spirit,—he who died amid the
                  scoffs and insults of his fellow-men, because he gave them light of which they
                  were unworthy? Called he not God the world's great Idol'? Ah! there is wisdom
                  higher far than this, which is but little known. There are kings and princes in
                  the earth, without their crowns and scepters; priests without their robes, and
                  prophets that never prophesy. Poor, blind humanity sits at the foot of Igdrasil,
                  the Tree of Life, and wonders at the darkness. Only a few brave souls have caught
                  the apples of immortal life, as Iduna let them fall. They hear the sound of the
                  golden Telyn, and walk with Baldar the beautiful, where Fraa creates eternal
                  spring. But, no! Why should I tell <emph>you</emph> this? Such words are only meet
                  for those who yearn for glory, honor, power, with an immortal love. Farewell."</p>
               <p>"Stay, stay!" said Gottlieb, as he seized him by the mantle: "I would hear you
                  further."</p>
               <p>"Listen, then. Glory is found in war no more, and lion-hearts must perish, unless
                  they find some nobler, higher sphere of action; and, urged by strong necessity, a
                  few have found it."</p>
               <p>"Where?"</p>
               <p>"Everywhere! Down in the bowels of these mountains, amid the silent shades of
                  Hela; far in the sunny realms of Gladheim, and beyond the gleaming pathway of the
                  stars, where Copernicus and Kepler and Tycho Brahe <emph>revel</emph> in the light
                  they saw so dimly from the earth. Philosophy has lent the key; and when men stand
                  in that enchanted realm, they see themselves as gods. The seven-colored bridges of
                  the skies serve<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6310-00000162"/> them as pathways to
                  their footsteps. They make the lightnings do their will. The sorceries and
                  enchantments known in ancient Egypt, and the miracles that make men tremble, to
                  them become familiar as a household tale. They talk with mighty spirits of the
                  past; and from the conquering heroes who made the hills run blood, and filled the
                  earth with mourning, they take the pent-up fire, and, like a vial of wrath, pour
                  it upon the earth. Then kingdoms are divided, and tyrants tremble on their
                  thrones; and all over the wide earth the young republics rise and struggle into
                  being. What say you to all this?"</p>
               <p>"Show me the way. I follow."</p>
               <p>"Then take this cup: drink strength and wisdom, and forget the follies of this
                  idle age."</p>
               <p>Gottlieb seized the cup, and raised it to his lips, and then as hastily withdrew
                  it.</p>
               <p>"No, not yet!" he said; "for I am not alone. There is an angel in the earth has
                  laid her gentle hand in mine, and bound me unto her with all the tenderest ties of
                  being. She sees God in the flowers, and hears him in the summer wind; and all her
                  nature gushes out in one great thought of love and goodness. I see her even now,
                  with those sweet eyes, blue as the gentian on the glacier's brink, and hear that
                  voice of music calling me back to her. Engel, my love! I will not leave thee!"</p>
               <p>"Poor, weak, faint-hearted man!" said Schwarz, in a tone of scornful pity. "Hand
                  me the cup. You are unworthy of the magic gift. A piece of painted earthenware
                  shuts out your sight of glory! Go to this flattering Delilah; lay your head upon
                  her lap, and let her rob you of your strength; but look! see where the moonlight
                  meets the shadow under yonder pine! There is a vision, fairer than the Peri that
                  haunt the Prophet's paradise. She smiles and calls to you, and waves her moonlight
                  arms with witching grace. O Gottlieb! drink, and she will come to thee."</p>
               <p>"Hand me the cup!" cried Gottlieb.</p>
               <p>"Will you renounce your earthly love?"</p>
               <p>"I will!"</p>
               <p>"And God?"</p>
               <p>"Ay, God himself!"</p>
               <p>He took the cup, and drank. With one deep groan, he fell into the arms that were
                  open to receive him. He saw the look of triumph that lit up the marble features,
                  and those fiery eyes burned to his very soul.</p>
               <p>"I knew that I could win thee!" said Schwarz exultingly. "I am always sure of
                  those who stand to parley with me. Engel of Lindenburgh! sweet dove! thy shield of
                  love has failed thee; but what is that to me? Look to thyself, for I will win thee
                  also!"</p>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>IT was midnight at Castle Löwenherz, and Engel of Lindenburgh lay on her
                     velvet-cushioned couch, asleep. The dim light from a shaded lamp fell on her
                     fair young face and the shining ringlets that rested on her neck and bosom. The
                     color came and went upon her cheek,<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6310-00000163"/>
                     and a tear stole from beneath the long-fringed lid. As she slept, the door was
                     gently opened, and a tall, matronly lady entered.</p>
                  <p>"Engel! Engel, my child!" she said, in a low tone.</p>
                  <p>"What? what?" said Engel, as she started up with a terrified look: "has any
                     thing happened, Lady Blanche?"</p>
                  <p>"No, no, my child! You need not be alarmed. Gottlieb, you know, left us before
                     sunset, and went up in the mountain. He has not returned: a storm is coming on;
                     and, being somewhat anxious, Baron Rodolph, with the servants and a number of
                     people from the neighboring village, have gone out to seek him."</p>
                  <p>"Is Norman with them?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes; and even good old Father Stilling. His absence would not trouble me
                     much,—he has been so in the habit of wandering away of late: but this storm,—I
                     do not like the look of those black clouds; and, besides, I have a strange
                     presentiment of evil,—a gloomy feeling, that I can not overcome. But why? What
                     ails my loved one? You surely have been weeping!"</p>
                  <p>Poor Engel could not speak. The tears gushed forth; and, weeping like a child,
                     she hid her face in the lady's bosom.</p>
                  <p>"I must go home to-morrow," she sobbed at last: "I am not happy here."</p>
                  <p>"To-morrow!" exclaimed Lady Blanche. "Why, dearest Engel? What do you mean? And
                     what will Gottlieb say to that?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! <emph>he</emph> will not care. He does not love me now."</p>
                  <p>"Engel, my child! he worships you."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! once he did; but now he says that I am only fit to work my turtle-doves
                     and lambkins with my German wool; and I shall never be a Löwenherz. But
                        <emph>you,</emph> my dear, dear lady-mother,—as once I hoped to call
                        you,—<emph>you</emph> will not love me less for this! Oh! if I thought you
                     would, my heart would break!"</p>
                  <p>Lady Blanche drew her still closer to her bosom; and, kissing her fondly, she
                     said, "Engel, once I was not a Löwenherz myself; and even now I am only one in
                     name. I can not think what has come over my poor child of late, he seems so
                     wild and strange; yet love him,—love him, Engel, with all your heart and soul;
                     for many a man has been redeemed by a true woman's love."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! I always shall," exclaimed Engel. "Should Gottlieb curse me to my very
                     face, and cast me from him like a worthless weed, I should love him still!"</p>
                  <p>A peal of thunder, that seemed to shake the old castle to its very foundations,
                     started them to their feet.</p>
                  <p>"Let us go below," said Lady Blanche.</p>
                  <p>They left the chamber, and hurried down a winding staircase into the great room
                     below. Scarcely had they descended, when the doors were thrown open, and Baron
                     Rodolph entered, followed by Norman and the other servants, bearing the
                     apparently lifeless form of Gottlieb.</p>
                  <p>"This way, Norman," said the baron, as he drew a couch toward the fire of
                     pine-boughs that was blazing on the hearth. "Now haste, and bring the
                     cordials."</p>
                  <pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6310-00000164"/>
                  <p>"Is he dead, Father Stilling?" asked Engel, as almost fainting, she laid her
                     hand on the arm of a venerable old man.</p>
                  <p>"No, lady, not dead; but he is chilled by exposure to the cold night-air."</p>
                  <p>"Baron Rodolph," said Norman, as he again made his appearance, "there is a
                     stranger without, who gives his name as Dr. Schwarz, and asks a shelter from
                     the storm."</p>
                  <p>"A doctor! bring him in, by all means."</p>
                  <p>All turned with a look of wonder toward the tall stranger, as he entered the
                     hall, and raised his hat, with its heavy crest of plumes, from his head.</p>
                  <p>"You are right welcome!" said Baron Rodolph, extending his hand. "Your services
                     will be very acceptable. My son, here, seems to be in a strange stupor, for
                     which I can not well account. Being somewhat alarmed at his late stay in the
                     forest, we went out to seek him, and found him near the Elfin Spring, and in
                     his hand this cup, which we have vainly attempted to take from him."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! indeed!" said Schwarz, as he stepped forward to the couch, near which
                     Engel was kneeling. With a quick glance, he scanned her features; and then,
                     unseen by all save Father Stilling, who had not turned his eyes from him, he
                     took the cup from Gottlieb's hand, and thrust it into his own bosom. "Yes," he
                     continued, after he had stood gazing at him thoughtfully for a moment; "I see
                     how it is: great mental excitement, exposure to night-air, and other causes,
                     have produced a temporary suspension of the physical energies. Nothing
                     alarming, however. I think—ah, yes! and he drew a small phial from his
                     girdle,—"I think that I can give him something that will soon restore him." He
                     raised Gottlieb's head, and poured a few drops of the dark liquid contained in
                     the phial between his parted lips. The effect seemed to be almost
                     instantaneous. He rose up on the couch, and turned his gaze from one to the
                     other, till it rested upon Engel, and Schwarz who stood beside her.</p>
                  <p>"Did I not promise you?" he said in an excited tone. "Have I not renounced
                     her,—yes, and my own soul beside?" And, groaning heavily, he sank back again
                     upon the couch.</p>
                  <p>"Let us pray," said old Father Stilling. "O God!" fervently exclaimed the old
                     man, as he knelt upon the floor and extended his hands,—"God, save us from the
                     evil spirits that have crossed this threshold!"</p>
                  <p>"Silence, old man!" shouted Schwarz, as he brought his foot heavily to the
                     floor. "Do you not see that he is dying for the want of proper care? and all
                     the prayers you can make between now and next midsummer will be of no avail
                     without it."</p>
                  <p>"Dear Father Stilling," said Engel entreatingly, as she laid her hand upon his
                     arm, "not just now. Wait yet a while."</p>
                  <p>The old man rose up and looked upon the faces of those around him; but he did
                     not find that sympathy he sought. He took his hat and staff to depart.</p>
                  <p>"Engel, my child," he said mournfully, "watch and pray, lest you enter into
                     temptation; for the spirits of evil are with you;" and, with the tears
                     streaming down his furrowed cheeks, he left the hall, and went forth into the
                     driving storm, with sad misgivings in his heart.</p>
                  <pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6310-00000165"/>
                  <p>"How inconsiderate some people are!" said Schwarz angrily, as he mingled a
                     powder in some water, and gave it to Gottlieb. In a few moments the color
                     returned to his cheeks and lips, and he lay sleeping as quietly as an infant.
                     "You need not apprehend any further danger," he continued; "but, if I am not
                     mistaken, here is one who needs attention much more than yonder sleeper;" and
                     he turned, with a pleasant smile, toward Engel.</p>
                  <p>"Why, my dear child," exclaimed Lady Blanche, "how you tremble! and how pale
                     and excited you look!"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, it is only from being frightened a little. It will soon pass off;" and she
                     smiled faintly; but she only trembled the more, and sank heavily upon a chair.
                     Schwarz took her hand gently in his, and counted the quick beating of her
                     pulse.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," he said, "a soothing draught is, indeed, necessary to quiet these
                     delicate nerves." He mingled another powder; and, yielding to the entreaties of
                     Lady Blanche, she drank it. A warmth and pleasing quiet spread through all her
                     frame. She could not turn her eyes from Schwarz, who stood regarding her
                     intently. His look and smile became enchantingly beautiful to her bewildered
                     eyes. She felt herself drawn toward him by an irresistible impulse; and,
                     fearing lest she should yield, with quick resolution she started up, and
                     hastened to her chamber.</p>
                  <p>Soon all was silent in the old castle. The pale blue lightnings gleamed, the
                     thunder roared, and the storm beat furiously without; but the tired inmates
                     slept heavily, save the faithful Norman, who watched by his master's couch, and
                     Schwarz in his lonely room.</p>

                  <p>THE morning sun was shining brightly through the old Gothic window when Engel

                              <p>Farewell! We meet no more. I go to join the mighty spirits of the
                                 past,—to dwell for ever in the sunny realms of Gladheim, where
                                 glory is a sure possession, and honor something more than name. You
                                 are too feeble and too frail to follow me,—too childlike, with your
                                 simple faith and quiet love: therefore, we part. May some kind arm
                                 support and bless you! but Gottlieb Löwenherz has entered higher
                                 service. Fare thee well, once more.</p>

                  <p>She only caught the purport of the words; then, springing to her feet, she
                     hastened to the room below. There truly stood the empty couch, and Norman
                     slumbering heavily beside it. Without thinking whither she was going, she
                     turned; and, almost flying through the dimly-lighted passage-ways, she opened a
                     small door, by which she came into the garden in the rear of the castle. As if
                     in pursuit of a spirit, away she darted along the winding pathways, till
                     suddenly, as she came out from a thick grove of larches into a more open space,
                     she stood face to face with Schwarz.</p>
                  <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6310-00000166"/>
                  <p>"Oh!" she cried, "have you seen him? He is gone, I know not whither!"</p>
                  <p>"Who is gone? Gottlieb,—your brother?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, he is not my brother!" she said hastily, while the crimson blood spread
                     over cheek and neck and brow. "Say, have you seen him?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, lady," said Schwarz slowly,—and he turned his eyes with the wily look of
                     a serpent upon her face,—"I have seen him. He is up yonder;" and he pointed to
                     the mountain-side. "Shall I lead you to him?"</p>
                  <p>She raised her eyes, and caught his earnest gaze. The strange, bewildering
                     feelings of the previous night came over her. She could not turn away her face,
                     but stood like one enchanted.</p>
                  <p>"Will you go with me?" said Schwarz. She stretched out her arms toward him. He
                     drew her closely to him: she felt his warm breath on her cheek, and she knew
                     that her feet were gliding swiftly over the green turf. "God help me!" she
                     cried, in agony of spirit. In an instant Schwarz had disappeared, and old
                     Father Stilling stood beside her.</p>
                  <p>"I knew," said the old man, with tears in his eyes,—"I knew, my dear child, you
                     were in danger, and I could not rest." She looked at him with a bewildered
                     stare.</p>
                  <p>"O Father Stilling!" she said at last, "I am not fit to live. May God forgive
                     me! Pray for me." She pointed toward the towers of Castle Lindenburgh; and,
                     before the old man could speak one word of farewell, she had vanished.</p>
                  <p>Days, weeks, passed on, and Engel was seen no more at Castle Löwenherz. Schwarz
                     became a constant visitor; but he could not find the one he sought.</p>
                  <p>One summer afternoon, as Father Stilling sat alone in his little parlor, the
                     door was gently opened, and Engel stood before him; but, oh! so pale and
                     altered that he scarce knew her.</p>
                  <p>"Father Stilling," she said, as she knelt at his feet and laid her hand on her
                     heart, "it is all still here now. Oh! I have suffered long and struggled hard;
                     but the trial has passed, and I feel in my inmost soul that God has forgiven
                     me. Now I have to seek your counsel."</p>
                  <p>"Say on, my child."</p>
                  <p>"An arrow flew into my open window this morning: see, now, what it brought me;"
                     and she handed him a paper on which were written a few lines from Gottlieb. The
                     old man took and read it.</p>

                  <p>"You must not go! you will not go, my child!" said the old man. "He will give
                     you up to Satan."</p>
                  <p>"Father Stilling," said Engel, "Gottlieb has sinned, and yet I love him as I
                     love my life. God helping me, I could go down into the very borders of the
                     fiery pit, to bring him thence. Oh! love is mighty, mightier than<pb
                        n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6310-00000167"/> death; ay, strong as God himself,
                     and evil has no power to harm it."</p>
                  <p>"Go, go!" said the old man. "I forgot my faith in God. Trust in him, and I will
                     pray for thee."</p>
                  <p>It was not long before the light foot of Engel pressed the green moss on the
                     mountain-side, and her white hands were grasping at the shrubs and tangled
                     vines to aid her up the rough ascent. The way was long and toilsome, but love
                     gave her strength; and just as the red light of the setting sun shone on the
                     tops of the gloomy old firs, she stood beside the Elfin Spring. Scarcely had
                     she reached this lonely spot, when the thick branches were thrust aside, and
                     Schwarz stood before her.</p>
                  <p>"I am happy to meet you once more, sweet lady!" he said with a pleasant
                     smile.</p>
                  <p>"Where is Gottlieb?" said Engel. "It was <emph>him</emph> I came to see."</p>
                  <p>"Not far hence; but he bids you drink these waters before you can come to
                     him."</p>
                  <p>"Never!" said Engel.</p>
                  <p>"Engel! Engel!" cried a voice from the wood. "Will you forsake me? Drink of the
                     water, and come to me."</p>
                  <p>"Gottlieb," said Engel, "have <emph>you</emph> drank of the Elfin Spring?"</p>
                  <p>"I have."</p>
                  <p>"Are you wiser, ay, and stronger?"</p>
                  <p>"As a very lion!"</p>
                  <p>"And God?"</p>
                  <p>Then came a loud, wild laugh, and all was still.</p>
                  <p>"Gottlieb! Gottlieb!" shrieked Engel, in her agony of spirit, we are parted for
                     ever!" She sprang forward to the entrance of the valley, but Schwarz stepped
                     before her.</p>
                  <p>"Stop!" he said, as his face grew marble pale, and his eyes flashed fire. "I am
                     not apt to trifle long with those that I would win. You will never see your
                     love again; but, as I live, you shall drink of yonder fountain." With one bound
                     he brought her to the brink of the little basin; and, filling the cup, he
                     raised it to her lips.</p>
                  <p>"God help me!" she cried, as she dashed it aside. The fir-boughs crashed as
                     though a young lion burst through them, and a strong arm felled Schwarz to the
                     earth. Engel sprang to her feet; and, looking up, she beheld the well-known
                     face of Father Stilling, while upon the ground the ever-faithful Norman was
                     struggling bravely with Schwarz.</p>
                  <p>"Unhand me, villain!" cried Norman, "or I shall do thee harm!" No answer was
                     returned; but, springing forward, they stood wrestling on the very brink of the
                     precipice, till both lost their footing and fell. Norman grasped at an oak
                     sapling which grew from a fissure in the rock; but Schwarz, with a wild cry,
                     bounding from point to point, disappeared in the forest below.</p>
                  <p>"May God forgive me!" said Norman, as he wiped the blood from his face; "but,
                     if I mistake not, the world could spare him far better than it could me."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                  <p>NOT far from the little village of Lindendorf was a quiet mountain glen, where,
                     once a year, usually, upon a clear, bright day in midsummer, a solemn
                     convocation was held by a certain religious order known as "The Children of the
                     Holy Spirit." It was one of those numerous associations which existed at one
                     time in the Catholic Church, springing up gradually, and continuing in active
                     operation for a while, till absorbed by a broader and more comprehensive
                     movement. The original founder had laid his life, a willing sacrifice, upon the
                     altar of duty, making even his death a noble example to those who should follow
                     after him. Although the inspiration of his personal presence was wanting, yet
                     each member of this order seemed to feel the quickening influences of his
                     spirit; and, with unwearied fidelity, they devoted themselves to the work to
                     which their lives were consecrated.</p>
                  <p>This order, in contradistinction to many of the time, was composed of both
                     males and females. A few were simply enthusiastic devotees; but by far the
                     larger number were earnest men and women, who had been disciplined by deep and
                     trying experiences in life, and who sought, by this consecration and
                     self-immolation, to exalt themselves above all that belonged to the perishing
                     and unsatisfactory things of earth. Their dress was of pure white, with the
                     emblem of the order—a star cut from glittering steel—fastened to the breast.
                     Their watchword was, "Love to God and man;" and, upon admission to the order,
                     each individual pledged himself, by a solemn vow, to "temperance, industry, and
                     never-failing charity." Their movements were controlled entirely by the silent
                     and inward teachings of the Holy Spirit, for which each one was his own
                     interpreter. Their mission extended to the lowliest of earth's children; and no
                     one was ever considered so depraved or lost, as to be beyond the saving
                     influences of their love. Many of these individuals were wayworn pilgrims,
                     traveling, in the fulfillment of their mission, to distant lands: others had
                     limited their sphere of action, and concentrated their energies upon some
                     especial undertaking. So superior had been the sanctity of some of their lives,
                     and free from indulgences of the lower nature, that they experienced a high
                     degree of spiritual illumination; and the revelations of truth which fell from
                     their lips brought to naught the wisdom of the worldly wise, and utterly
                     confounded the most prominent material philosophers.</p>
                  <p>At their yearly gatherings, those who had been previously and duly proposed
                     were received into the order. At the initiation ceremony, the men were crowned
                     with evergreens mingled with thorns, but the women with wreaths of pure white
                     lilies. A cup of cold water was placed in the hand, the vow of fidelity was
                     taken, and then the whole assemblage repeating the watchword, "Love to God and
                     man." each drank from his cup, as a symbol of the inward reception of that
                     spiritual truth which unites the soul to the invisible and eternal.</p>
                  <p>Never was there a more fitting place for the consummation<pb n="336-337"
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000169"/> mation of a solemn rite than this secluded spot.
                     Almost shut in by the surrounding mountains, and shaded by graceful larches and
                     lindens, through which the wind swept with low, thrilling murmurs, it seemed to
                     have been dedicated by Nature to the worship of the beautiful and true. The
                     broad, mossy stones served for seats; and in the center gushed up a spring of
                     purest water, scattering its silver sheen in the changing light, and filling
                     the air with music. It was at one of these yearly convocations, that Engel of
                     Lindenburgh stood in the midst of the assemblage, with the crown of lilies upon
                     her head.</p>
                  <p>The look of hope and joy had faded from her countenance, leaving naught but
                     meek submission; and, as she stood with bowed head and clasped hands, she
                     seemed like some sad angel, waiting for the voice which should call her to a
                     home of peace.</p>
                  <p>Father Stilling raised the cup containing the sacred emblem in his hand. "Drink
                     of this, my child," said he, "and forget thy woe and sorrow in the love of God,
                     that faileth never."</p>
                  <p>She took the cup; when, suddenly, from the midst of the lindens, sprang forth
                     Gottlieb, and stood before her.</p>
                  <p>"Engel, Engel!" he cried, "if you drink of that cup, you are lost to me for
                     ever! But here!" and he held out a shining goblet filled with water from the
                     spring; "drink thou of this, and happiness and joy you never dreamed of shall
                     be ours."</p>
                  <p>"No, Gottlieb, no!" said Engel mournfully: "take away your cup. This is the one
                     that I have chosen, with all its crosses and afflictions. My heart is breaking
                     for you, Gottlieb, but I must renounce you. May God have mercy on you!" and,
                     putting it to her lips, she drank.</p>
                  <p>In an instant he dashed his cup to the ground, and, springing forward, knelt at
                     her feet. "Engel!" he cried, as he clasped his arms around her, "O Engel! I
                     have been deceived and dazzled blind by that bewitching element where my
                     ambition led me. I can not see the green old earth; and even you seem but a ray
                     of silver light to my dim eyes. Oh, pity me! for I am dying with these fearful
                     fires that scorch my heart and brain. Weep! weep cool, blessed tears upon my
                     face, and tell me that you love me!"</p>
                  <p>Poor Engel! How her woman's heart gave way! "O Gottlieb!" she exclaimed, 'would
                     to God that I might save you!" With gushing tears she clasped her arms about
                     his neck, and laid her face to his. Closer, closer still he held her to his
                     bosom; and as he caught the throbbings of her heart, and heard the words that
                     trembled on her lips, as she besought God for him in an agony of prayer, he,
                     too, wept like a little child. Then the dimness fell from his eyes; and,
                     looking up, he saw the green old earth and waving trees once more, and over all
                     the summer sunshine like the smile of God. It was the sweet awakening from his
                     troubled dream; and, as the light of gladness gushed in upon his soul again,
                     Hope's fairest rainbow shone upon the gloomy clouds that lay so thick
                     around.</p>
                  <p>"Give me the cup that you have drank of, Engel," he said: "be it or strength or
                     weakness, it is all the same to me. My spirit thirsteth for the water of
                     eternal life." He took it from her hand and drank; and, lifting up his eyes
                     again, something more than summer<pb n="338-339 (Advertisement) "
                        xml:id="VAC6310-00000170"/> sunshine and the melody of birds came in upon
                     his soul.</p>
                  <p>"God! God!" he exclaimed: "I know that he hath heard me, for I feel his
                     presence in my heart! O Engel! I am, then, forgiven. But you, my blessed one!
                     Oh, how you must despise me for such weakness! How have I proved myself
                     unworthy of my name! I go to win a holier and a better. Engel, I know you pity,
                     but I will not ask you to forgive. Farewell!"</p>
                  <p>"Stay, Gottlieb, stay!" said Engel, "As God forgives you, so can I. Are we not
                     one in faith and love?"</p>
                  <p>"Be ye one also, then, in life!" said Father Stilling, as he joined their
                     hands. "It is meet the lion-heart should take an angel for his guide. May all
                     ambition perish, that walks not hand in hand with love!"</p>
                  <p>The Elfin Fount has dried up from its source; but some say, even now its
                     crimson waters gush up in the hearts of men, and fill their souls with madness.
                     God forbid that it should desolate this fair earth! but if one
                        <emph>must</emph> drink of it, let him also take the water of SPIRITUAL
                     TRUTH, of which he shall not drink in vain; for thus shall he add unto his
                     MATERIAL PHILOSOPHY the inspiration and the glory of a living faith.</p>
