PRITCHARD;   NEW YORK: WYNKOOP &amp; SHERWOOD, 18 BETMAN STREET.  1868.   &#xD;<pb n="0" xml:id="VAC7507-00000002"/> ENTERED, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1867, by WYNKOOP &amp; SHERWOOD, tn the Clerks Office of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York. W. aC ROOuES A CO., PRINTEIMB, So. 1"Fulton Street, N. T.    PREFATORY NOTE. It may not be amiss to apprise the reader that the following Story, under the name of STORM- CLIFF, has appeared as a serial in HOURS AT HOME during the current year. - In this form it has at- tracted wide attention, and called forth numerous and earnest requests that it should be given to the * public in a book. The writer of this has no pecu- niary interest in the, matter; but, knowing how favorably it has been received by the numerous readers of the above Magazine, and thoroughly convinced of its pure and healthful tone, and adapt- ability, not only to entertain, but to instruct and improve, he is glad to learn that arrangements have been made for its republication by a new and enterprising House, who will do ample justice to it in a business way. We need not say a word as to the character of the book, to those who have read it; but to those who have not, it may not be thought impertinent to remark that, while there is no sensational ele-  &#xD;<pb n="ii-iii (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC7507-00000003"/> il.      PREFATORY NOTrE. ment in it, it will he found to be anything but a dull story. There is1 just plot enough to give it dramatic interest. ' The characters, though few, are sharply defined and well sustained. The move- ment of the story is rapid, and it is crowded with incidents, many of them of a thrilling character. There is not a chapter thrown in to fill up. It grows in interest to the very end. The denouement, too, is just as one would have it. While it is not a re- -ligious story, its whole atmosphere is bracing, and the impression it makes is in the right direction. It happily and forcibly illustrates one feature of comn- mon, every-day experience-to wit, the Counter Influences which assail every path of Duty, and the insufficiency of human reason and strength to guide one aright and give the needed strength. Sure we are that no Christian family need fear the influ- ence of such kind of fiction as is here presented; and since people will read works of fiction, and the young in particular, it is desirable to introduce such only as are healthful and elevating in the moral and social qualities.

WAITING BY THE FIRE AND WATCHNG BY THE SEA. cTzEu let this be the last night we spend unded the same roof," said David Chester to Faye Ches- ter, his wife. Did Faye Chester know her power as she sat on the hearth-rug at her husband's feet? Possibly she did, for, without lookin , up from the flame of the fire that burned beforeher, the pretty coral door-keepers of her words gave way, and a low, mockin  g laugh ran out from them. "David Ches- ter, you know that can not be,  you love me t oo much.  Go, if you can." "You still refuse my wish?" "Yes, David, I do. Come, give me a kiss and forget all about it.  How the wind raves!" A x Faye spoke, she lifted both hands toward her hu s band to be helped up, just as she had done a hun- dred times before, for the hearth-rug was a chosen place in the early autumnal evenings. She liked  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7507-00000005"/> 6         FAYE MAR. to get down "even with the fire." I wonder if she knew what a pretty picture she made, sitting there, in her pure white raiment, with the flame- glow reddening over her and mingling with the clear gray tint of her eyes, making them burn like opals. "Faye! Faye, my darling! pity me; pity my great love for you, and tell me you consent. Once more, I beg you to give way in this thing." Her pretty white hands were still outstretched toward David Chester, but he took them not. "I tell you, I never will. She does not love me; she hates me, and you for loving me. I will not live under the same roof with her, lest I, too, learn to hate." The hands had fallen, and a serious look was bent into the living coals before her. "Faye Chester, my wife! You know my prom- ise. Farewell! "Ah! going, are you?" she laughed. "I would wait for daylight and pleasant weather, if I were you." And not a thrill ran through the heart of the little lady as she heard the hall-door close. The great-gale of the autumn was on its grand march over sea and land; it slid across -the rocky mountain-tops, and shook the foliage from mount- ain-sides and river courses, as if it were a demon of destruction. Out at sea, it was reveling in all its might of storm-power, and the waves beat the   FAYE MAR.          7 shore with a thunder of majesty terrible to hear; and yet, in the mountains there were chasms and secluded recesses filled with silence and calms; in the ocean, were miles on miles of motionlessness, where gale had never been; but, in David Chester's heart, nay, in his whole being, there was no place of peace. Itis only man who is stirred from   the very foundations of his nature by the storms which sweep over him. Into a great deep of darkness and tempest; into a fiery storm, scorching and blinding and deafening, was this man cast, by the simple refusal of his, wife. That which he had asked of her was a home in his house for Mrs. Chester, his mother. Long and earnestly had he reasoned and urged and besought, and at last conditioned; but reason and condition were alike cast aside by that small per- son on the hearth-rug. Light and shadow of fire-light playing over her Faye Chester sat on after his departure, and thought of the few years of her married life; how precious it had been to feel always and all-where the atmos- phere of her husband's love enveloping her beingo as entirely as the soft blue bands of air wind around the earth; and she had so lived since the chime of their marriage-bells, without a thought of ever get- ting outside of that sweet atnmosphere; and even as she sat and heard a  footstep along the hall, a  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7507-00000006"/> 8         FAYE MAR. smile played over her face at the thought of David Chester's powerlessness to leave her. A knock at the door! Mrs. Chester sprang into being at once; the little woman on the hearth dis- appeared, and in her place stood the mistress of ' Storm-Cliff," and, save for the opaline beaming in her eyes, you would scarcely have recognized Faye Chester. "Where is Mr. Chester?" asked a servant. "He is gone out, Andrew, but will return pres-. ently." "Shall I admit Mr. Monroe?" "Yes, and to this room, the night is too cold without fires." The low booming of ocean-surf always lingered about the region of Storm-Cliff. The thunders of the great deep shook the whole beach that night, as the waves lashed sand and rock, scarcely a mile distant from the pure white walls of David Ches- ter's home. Just on that mile of -the great At- lantic's rim, shone out, high and firm and white, a huge cliff, that bordered the home-land of the Chesters. The ancestral line of the Chesters had not ceased to hold Storm-Cliff in its possession since the year of the landing of Benjamin Chester on the Western Hemisphere; it had become to them the grand centre from whence all that was loyal   FAYE MAR.          9 and great and true in the Chester race should radiate. Thither, from year to year, they who bore the name, and they to whom the name had been given, went up or down or across, from their scattered dwellin%-places, to renew again and yet again ties of affection and of love. This gather- ing together was a grand incentive to worthy action in young and old. The work of the year was then and there summed up, and to him who had achieved the best or the noblest, or the truest in life, the family jewel was intrusted, until the next annual meeting of the Chesters. This jewel was a ruby of great rarity and value, set in a star of gold, and as dear to the race as aught, except its own love of noble deeds, could be. It had been given by a monarch, scores of years in the past, in -gratitude for his life saved by his faithful subject, Charles Chester. On the last annual meeting the ruby had been bestowed for the year upon David Chester. A great gleam shot out from  the jewel in the fire- light as he disappeared, and Faye Chester saw it. The wings of the storm buffeted around the man; its thunders at first deafened, then entranced, until, at the last, he was lifted up, as it were, into the presence of the storm-power, and borne by it down to the place of its throne, the coast. Up and down the white sands, tongues of  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7507-00000007"/> 10         FAYE MAR. watery fire leaping up into his foot-prints, went this man, left to the earth for resource and com- fort. The sea was phosphorescent; far and near black waves were crowned and tipped with lumin- ous fire. The long line of Storm-Cliff was laved at its base in a garment of sea-flame, the winds lifted the sea higher and higher, as if to wrap the cliff in a mantle of light, and the tide was rising. Low and black hung the clouds over earth and waters. There were pauses in the grand anthem of the equinoctial in which one's very soul stood still to listen on that night, and in which, as in drowning, the events of life were brought visibly to the mind's surface. David Chester reviewed his life; nay, his life passed in review before him. All its grandness, all its littleness, its joy, and its present bitter trial, came and went in slow procession up and down along the sands, as he trod them. Storm-Cliff gleamed out suddenly from   the blackness, as he turned his face landward after hours of wandering. New forces had been sent into the storm to break up its power. A long, low peal of thunder mingled itself in with the noise of the blast. Faye Mar and David Chester had met five years earlier than this night. Born in the far-off India, bred into camp-   F AEY MAR.         " life through childhood, and only sent home for education, when it was suddenly discovered one day that she was more deficient in learning than a private's daughter of less age than she; pretty, imperious, and loved by her father as men love an only child for whose welfare they gave their lives, Faye Mar went through the formula of an English education, very much as a comet sweeps the planetary sphere-in it, but not of it. To return to the wild freedom of life with her father, was the strong desire of her nature. Faye sprang out of rules and forms, and with a joyous "peal to freedom" she was once again on board the packet that should convey her to all that she prized most in life. When, one evening, all unexpectedly, a fair, slightly tall young lady appeared in Major Mar's bungalow, with a cry that rang into his heart-a cry that articulated, "Papa, I've come, I've come back to you, take me in," and his arms infolded Faye--then did Major Mar comprehend   that In- dian camp-life, possible for Faye Mar the child, would not be a wise life for the young lady who had come back to him. But what should be done with her? He had not a relative to whom his jewel might be con- signed for safe-keeping. '"I will never, no never, leave you," said Faye, when a   return to- E1ng-  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7507-00000008"/> 12        FAYE MA R. land was suggested; "you sent me to school that I might fit myself to be a companion for you. I remember every word you said that night, and * for that I promised to go. I went, I have come back, and if we are driven into the jungle, I will never leave you, papa. Do you wish me to go away and love any body else; are you tired of your Faye, papa?"And the lonely man who could command men, could not unwind from his neck the arms of his child and bid her go from him; he could only wrap the bit of "Dear Devo- tion," as he loved to call her, a little more fondly to his heart, and bid her stay. From that day the young lady adopted the name her father had bestowed upon her, and the signature "Faye Mar, D. D.," (Dear Devotion) was certain to work its way to suit the little lady's will. As time went on, Major Mar became more and more convinced that either Faye must leave him, or he must give up his commission. Decision came in the form of Indian fever, which reduced Faye from the fresh, bright English girl to a pale, wan, lifeless child, who seemed to be dying under the torrid heats of the land. More and more of tint and freshness came to Faye withl every degree gained to the northward, and the airs from the mountains under the sea set her heart abeat with life and vigor, so that when   FAYE MAR.         13 the home-land was gained, Major Mar returned to olden places and friends, with the illness of Faye his 'apology for appearing, although the sunny blushes of that young lady seemed to set them- selves at variance with the statement. Weary with English rule in India, and heart-  sick of military despotism, Major Mar sold his commission and turned his whole attention to the study of political economy. With Faye for his darling companion he journeyed from kingdom to kingdom, and having made European politics familiar in theory, he came to our beloved Western Republic, to learn from it, what of wisdom might be in it. As David Chester paced -the wave-driven sands he looked up at Storm-Cliff, his heart abeat with the thought of five years past. Again he fancied he could see that little figure, clad in white, perched on the cliff, looking out at sea, so far and so soulfully, that, although he stood on the sands until the sun had gone down, he might have been a grain of the sands or a wave of the ocean' so en- tirely was she unconscious of his presence below. That peculiar opaline light in the child's eyes, as the last rays of the sun passed over them, beamed far out at sea and down on David Chester, telling him that there was fear in the little one, waiting there. 1A  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7507-00000009"/> "  F. AYE MAR. Not often had he clirmbed the cliff, but in the twilight he went softly around, on that night, and, holding his breath, lest he' should alarm the mo- tionless figure, he gained the height. The soft summer day had held its hand lovingly over the surface of ocean, pressing down each shining wrinkle, and, at twilight, a low, dead calm lay on the waters, while, from below, beat upward the motion of the tidal heart that can never, while time lasts, be still. "Alone, child, on this high cliff! have you no fear?" he had said, standing beside Faye Mar. "I am not a child, and ought I to be afraid? My father went out at daybreak with the fisher- men, and I can not see him anywhere. It is grow- ing dark; tell me, is there danger for him? the boat seemed so small;" and not once did Faye Mar withdraw that earnest, patient outlook from over the great deep. "It is very calm; the fishermen at our village are careful men, do not alarm yourself. How long have you been here?" "I do not know, they went at daybreak; I was here in time to see the boat go out of sight; I came from breakfast here." "Tell me, where are you staying? not at the village? that is too far from here; besides--" and David Chester had paused. There was some-   FAYE MAR.         15 thing in the language and the air of the child, as he still thought her to be, that forbade the idea of a residence in the fishing-villagce four miles below. "No, at the large place down below, where so many are staying. We came last week; I do not remember the name of the house, you know it. You are Mr. Chester, papa told me, and that is your home over there. Papa has a letter to you friom  some friend of his-some one who knows you. There, there! I see a tiny sail! Oh! if it only is papa! I'll never let him go to sea again without Faye Mar, D. D."   And a sunny smile dimpled the dimples of the watcher. "I never heard that'name." "That is papa's name for me; no one else knows what it means. Isn't it nice to have a name that no one else knows? It makes me think of the white stone and the 'new name' to be writ- ten thereon. Do you see the sail?" "If you will tell me the name by which you are known, I will do my best to find the fishing-boat; the sail you have seen is a ship comingo in." f"yIy papa is an English gentleman, his name is Maurice Mar ; ought to be Scotch, but he is not; and I am his only child. Do you see the boat?" "It is not come to the rim of the horizon; it is growing late, and I can not leave you here alone. Will you come with me, and I will send you safely  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7507-00000010"/> 16        FAYE MAR. home? Besides, you must be nearly famished with hunger." For one moment Faye Mar's eyes could not see the darkening distance seaward for the tears that filled them. Wearied with the long walk in the morning, faint from want of food, and worn with her vigil on the cliff, the child, if she had been any other child, would have gently yielded, and gone to the home of David Chester. "No, no," she said; I feel as if I was papa's light-house, set here on this rock; as if I went down the light would go out, and he be lost. You must let me stay." And argument failed to lift the little light-house from the cliff. Beneath the pure white walls of Storm-Cliff, scarce a mile distant, David Chester knew full well that his mother impatiently awaited his return. He had promised to be with her -at sunset, and impatience of delay, he knew full well, arose with Mrs. Chester to all the power of a passion. "Miss Mar, you are not afraid to stay here alone?" "Papa told me the coast was safe for miles, and this cliff is in your own grounds, is it not?" "If you have no fear, there is not the slightest danger. You must make me one promise-not to leave the place until I return." "I promise, unless the boat comes in. I can scarcely see."   FAYE MAR.         17 The little light-house showed its faithful watch for an hour after David Chester went. Curiously, weirdly, the wind sprang up after the darkness was let down, and the moon came from the far east without a sign to tell whether it had met the little fishing-boats in their westward journey. The Storm-Cliff stood at the shore-end of the long line of light the moon shed over the ocean, like a huge pier on which it might safely rest; and on its sumnnit fluttered the little white flag that told of the true faith of Faye Mar, as David Chester returned shoreward. The maiden from the fishing-village, who served in his house, and who walked. beside him to the cliff, was scarcely larger than the keeper of the light; ,but, with re- finement of manner, born' of true sympathy, (for she had watched the coming home of a boat that never yet had come to land) she placed before Faye Mar the tempting food she had brought. "Pray eat it, miss," she said; " who knows but we shall watch all night, and you would not wish to be asleep when the boat comes in." There was magic in these words, "We shall' watch," beyond all persuasion, and she, who had fasted since early morning ate. The moon reached the zenith. Three figures, wrapped in dark folds, held their places on the cliff, while the winds grew stronger and stronger,  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7507-00000011"/> 18        FAYE MAR. and the surf down below beat its grand marches on the sands. Words had grown powerless. Faye Mar would watch there. At last her eyes wan- dered for a moment from the bridge of moon-rays over which the boat must pass in its homeward way, to the little maiden by her side. Sitting upright, the child was asleep, the moonlight shin- ing over her pretty, childish features, making them seem younger and fairer and fresher than they were. Faye said, "I think, Mr. Chester, this girl should be at home. See, she is sleeping, and the wind is cold; will you go now? it soon will be daylight. She will work to-morrow and I can sleep." a We can not leave you here, perchance the boat is already at the village." "No ; I have never looked away from the broad light yonder, and you yourself said it must cross that track. Do leave me and go home." "David, David! Whose could ba that voice, cold and stern, calling over the rocks in the depth of night? Mr. Chester stood erect, and cried, "Here, moth- er, I am, up the cliff. Stay! I will come to you!" "I am come to you!"  And a tall form ap- peared on the cliff itself, a height to which the lady of "Storm-Cliff House" had not attained,   FAYE MAR.        19 by daylight, in all the years of her life. The little maid'from the fishing village started up and be- gan to tremble, widely awake at the first sound of Mrs. Chester's voice. (' What does this mean? Why are you, David- Chester, not in your own room? Why are you here at this time of night, Olive?" Olive trembled for answer. David Chester said, "Mother, this is Miss Mar'; her father went out in the early morning with fishermen from the vil- lage, and she is watching for his return." "I should like to know where Miss Mar was brought up, that she does not see the impropriety of spending the night with you, on this cliff. A young lady would never dream of such a thing." "Pray hush, mother." David Chester almost groaned the words; but the clear, unshaken voice of Faye Mar answered: "Madam Chester, I was 'brought up,' as you term it, in an Indian bungalow. My father is all I have in the whole world. He is on the sea to- night, and I am nearer to him here, than in my room in the great hotel. Is this cliff yours, that I may not wait upon it?" "Impertinence!" ejaculated Mrs. Chester. "Madam, I am not impertinent. I love my father, and I only wait and watch for him. Your son and your maid need stay no longer. I see my  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7507-00000012"/> 20        FAYE MAR. father's boat-there, there! crossing the light. I must go." As Faye spoke the little boat turned in its course, the sea was risen into yeasty billows, and clouds of sea-foam were beating at the base of the cliff. Without another glance at Mrs. Chester, Faye almost ran down the steep side of the cliff. Even David Chester, man as he was, could not have kept pace with the white, flying figure, had he attempted it. To assist his mother down, where she seemed to have climbed with such ease, was a slow and tiresome endeavor; and when the sands were reached, he could just discern a mist of white on the beach below, in the direction the boat was making. "It was a curious place for the fishing-boat to land," Faye thought; " nothing but a white reach of sand, and the breakers were surging over it." "Mother, since you have come out here into the night, I pray you wait here ; possibly that is not the boat, and the child is alone." "Child!" echoed Mrs. Chester, and the fine tone of scorn that wrapped the word seemed to light its way, swift as lightning, into David Chester's heart. He left his mother with the little maid Olive, who trembled more than ever at the severe lecture on propriety that the stern lady of Storm-Cliff thought it her duty to bestow, while she paced the beach in the direction of the boat.   FAYE MAR,.        21 "It is the boat, I know it!" cried Faye Mar, as David Chester approached. Steadily it came onward, riding the billows like the staunch little bark it was. Sail and mast and hull, it rose into sight; then was lost in the valley of water below only to rise again and again, and draw- nearer and nearer to the beach. A group of men were gathered in the stern of the boat. Faye saw them quite distinctly, and recognized the faces as the boat rode a high wave. She had gone to the village on the previous night with her father to make the engagement for the day. Suddenly the occupants of the fishing-vessel saw the fluttering white of Faye's garments. They had thought the coast to be deserted. There was a little haven close by, where at just a turn of the tide the boat might ride in in safety. Into the haven they were guiding the boat when .they saw figures on the sands. It was too late to: turn, the wind was getting itself into a gale, and the ocean was putting on its might. Faye Mar cared noth- ing for wind or ocean, for boat or haven, so that her father had come home. Her long watching broke into a little carol of joy, which, had the child known the heart of her Father: in heaven, would have resolved itself into a thanksgiving. "The boat is getting into Cliff-Haven; come,"  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7507-00000013"/> -22    PFAYE MAft. said David Chester, " five minutes and it will be at anchor." He led Faye onward, his mother and Olive fol-.. lowing. "Why did not papa know me?" said Faye, as if to herself; and then, under the rocks, close to the surf, they went, and were in the bit of harbor, just large enough to float the boat. Were the men worn out with their fishing that they entered in that death-like silence? Still as a statue stood the small white figure, while the anchor went down, while the main-sail was sliding adown the mast, while one after another the men stepped from the boat to the rock beside her, until in the boat there was no human being. "What have you done with my father?" Moon and stars kept their appointed places in the heavens, the sea beat its heart against the rock just outside; the first faint line of day-dawn lay across the east, the fishermen stood in silence, and there was no answer for Faye Mar. "Where is my father?" she cried, and again there was no answer; the little fishing-vessel just moved to and fro, and they, who alone could have spoken, spake not. "Will no one tell me where my father is?" An instant of silence followed the third appeal, and then the oldest man among the fishermen   PAYE MAR.         23 spoke, "I will, if it drowns me. Poor child, we lost him overboard.!" and the man hurried away. Just outside the little harbor-basin, had there been one to listen, that one would have heard strong sob- bing, and seen tears stealing down the fisherman's cheeks. It was two-score years since he had seen the curling waters strike down the gold of a little head, that but a moment before had been safe be- side him in his boat. He remembered the face of his wife as she came down at evening to meet him and their child. Faye Mar seemed to slowly contract, as if with- ering under the blight. Mrs. Chester said,.putting out her hand as if to rest it on her shoulder, "Think, Miss Mar, how many have been drowned before, how many have borne bravely the drown- ing of friends."  Mrs. Chester's hand did not touch Faye Mar's shoulder, for the blighted little figure had dropped upon the rocks at her feet. "Go home, mother, and prepare a place for Miss Mar," besought David Chester, he hovering over the little mass of white, not knowing pre- cisely how to gather it up. "C If you are going to carry her, I will. I sup- pose she must be brought in by some one, but I should think it much more proper .that one of the mnen carry her." I do not think David Chester heard the words  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7507-00000014"/> 24         FAYE MAR. his mother had spoken, but he gave heed to Olive's gentle tender of assistance. Storm-Cliff lay one mile distant; and as David Chester turned his face toward it, bearing the burden that was as nothing before the strength and power that were within him, he almost smiled to hear the words, "We will follow Mr. Chester, lest his strength give out," and the fishermen kept pace with them. The little maid Olive walked, now on one side, then on the other, holding the cold hands of Faye Mar in her own, and gently tryinag to urge back the warm blood into them. Only once did she speak; it was when the light - of morning revealed fully the face he carried, that she asked: "Do you think she is dead, Mr. Chester?" "We will keep her alive, you and I, Olive," he had said; and she had whispered, "No one but God can do that, Mr. David;" and laid softly over the motionless face the bit of lace, that had served for a vail. The cliff-road ran in an unswerving line from the shore to the entrance of Storm-Cliff. Just outside the reach of sea-sprays, gnarled, twisted, wind-driven trunks of wild-cherry trees, lined the road; above them, hung tufts of green, that formed welcome shade from  summer heats.  The sun came to the ocean's rim, just as David Chester $t   PAYE IMAR.        25 reached the wild-cherry trees. He sat down on a fallen tree-trunk, more to rest the burden he car- ried, than to ease his own arms. Olive -gently held the face of Faye Mar in her hands, and she broke into a radiant smile as the sunlight struck across the fair features, for a soft sigh came through the closed lips. "She is alive, Master David," said Olive. He was standing looking down upon the two girls, so unlike in birth and education, so like in that some- thing that shines out higher than mortal birth, and stronger than any art of knowledge. "Thank you, Olive," he answered, bending to bear onward the helpless child. "I wonder for what he thanked me," thought Olive. "I don't believe he knew what he was saying." The sun was risen when the angle of shadow from the white walls -of Storm-Cliff fell first across the face of Faye Mar. Was there something in the very shadow of it that aroused her into con- sciousness? David Chester had not reached the entrance when, with a sigh that smote into his being, he heard the words, "Why did you bring me back, why didn't you let me go to my father?" He strode into the hall, up the stairway, and met his mother at the top of it, '"-What room?" 2  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7507-00000015"/> 26        FAYE MAR. "In there!" The door stood opened. It was the entrance to the pearl-room.   The last occupant of the bed upon which Daviel Chester laid Faye Mar, had been Margaret Ches- ter. From pearl to emerald had been the change, for the last daughter of the family. The summer sun was shining into the grass above her grave at that moment. ," There! leave her to me!" and Mrs. Chester bad almost thrust her son from the room. The process of recovery into which Faye Mar found herself involved, necessitated all the power that was latent in her to endure. Mrs. Chester forbade her to speak, where no words were pos ble. She moved about the room issuing orders that were obeyed, simply because there was no power of resistance. She issued orders that we'e not obeyed, because there was no power of obedi- ence. Faye Mar was told to eat of food that was pu to her lips, when the power of swallowing was suspended. She was told to "cry, that crying would relieve her," when the midday sun of sor- row was burning into her brain, and one might a, soon expect night-dews at noonday. The hours went by, until it was almost evening, and yet Faye Mar had not spoken, except the words to David Chester. She lay upon Margaret   tAVE MAAL .      7 Chester's bed, as motionless (save for the breath- ing that quickened as time went on) as she who lay beneath the emerald in the graveyard. Sitting there, in the solemn quiet, Mrs. Chester resolved that this young lady, so suddenly put into her house, should not exert any influence over her son; and, to that end, she carefully excluded every one of the household from the room, that her name, even, should not be heard in the house. As often as David Chester appeared at the door, to make inquiry, so often was the command of the doctor, that "the patient should rest undis- turbed," repeated. At last there came a sound of heavy feet on the stairs and along the hall. It was of men bring- ing in baggage from the hotel down the coast. David Chester had sent for it with a purpose; and despite the assurance of Mrs. Chester that the pearl-room was no place for trunks, he ordered one in. It was a small, foreign trunk, that he rightly judged had been known to Major Mar's daughter all her life. It was her father's, insepa- rable from him in all his travels. The opaline light sprang into her eyes the instant they rested on the trunk. "I must go and watch for my father," she said, springing up, instinct with life and energy, and then, suddenly discovering her surroundings, she  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7507-00000016"/> 28        FAYE MAt. cried out, "Oh! why did you let me go to sleep and forget it, perhaps it is too late ; do you hear? I must go now?" All the dignity of manner, all the power at Mrs. Chester's command, were as dry grass before the fire of Faye Mar's purpose. "Madam, no one has ever stood between me and my father, and you must not; I could not bear it, nor could he ; please call some one to pre- pare me and let me go." "She is quite frantic," whispered Mrs. Chester to her son, waiting at the door, " you must send some one to help hold her." "I will send Olive," he said; IIbut, mother, ask her where she wishes to go." "Ask a madman, what he raves about?" ex- claimed Mrs. Chester, shutting the door, at which, in a few seconds, Olive waited. A half hour passed, and then Olive quietly went out to Mr. Chester. "Do you think," she said, " it would kill Miss Mar to go down to the cliff again-? It certainly will kill her to treat her so," and Olive cried like a child. "To treat her so! tell me what you mean?" and David Chester shook Olive's arm, until, from very pain, she ceased sobbing and told him that Mrs. Chester had taken from the room the dress   FAYE AAR.        29 Miss Faye had worn the night before, and was holding her hands fast in her ownlest she should rise. "Do, Mr. Chester, take the poor young lady to the shore; may be the sight of the waters wh ake hercry. I will carry her myself if there is no other way." "Nonsense, child, there is no need that any one carry her from Storm-Cliff; come with me Olive." And they straightway went to the pearl- room. "Mother, I must see you one minute; leave Miss M1ar with Oive, and come to me, or I come to you." "Any thingf to keep my son from  this grl," thought the proud   woman of Storm-Cliff and she, telling Olive to hold fast the hands she re- leased, went to him.  "Well, David, what is it?" "Mother, I wish to take that poor child in there to the shore. I beliee it to be best that she go." "David Chester, do you think I am to be over- ruled in such a thin g. as this? Is it not enough that she is brhf nt0 tha t she is brugh into my house in such a man- ner, without your interfering, after I have taken all the trouble I have?"  Mothel I u   st take her to the cliff ; her life I,believe dep ends upon it..

"No, David, I will not, nor shall my carriage go forth on such an errand; but I will order it to convey her out of the house ; she shall go back to the hotel." "' Mother, do you forget whose house this is, in which we have heretofore dwelt in quiet?"David Chester could not say " peace." "Then I go out of it." "No, mother, not for such a cause, not for any cause; but, mind my words, in the thirty years of my life I have not once, where my own interests were concerned, gone contrary to your expressed will. If I were in there, you should hold my hands, you should exercise the most of your power unquestioned ; but against that child you shall not. I put all the might of my manhood between you and her; let me pass! I have de- termined to take her to the sight of that which has destroyed her father." Mrs. Chester did not move, she stood directly before the door of the pearl-room, her cold, dark eyes fixed in ineffable scorn on her son, her hand fast to the knob, as if she would there hold it against the world. A sharp conflict in the mind of David Ches- ter-a sudden spasm, as of pain too quick to be groaned out, and he knelt at his mother's feet. "Mother, I pray you let me in!" "An adventurer's daughter!  Yes, go in,   FAYE MAR.         31 David Chester," and she flung the door widely open. There stood Faye Mar, quietly robed in a soft gray dress, her eyes gleaming with a strange lustre that could not reflect back the angry scorn of Mrs. Chester. That lady no sooner discovered Faye Mar stand- ing thus, than she, with one of those subtle, quick movements peculiar to reptiles, was within the room, with the key in her hand and the lock turned. "Miss Mar!" she exclaimed, "I am glad to see that you are so far recovered as to return to your hotel. I will send you in my carriage, and your baggage can follow." a Thank you, madam, I will, go now, if you will let me pass. I am  sorry"-and almost a sob broke forth--' that my father can not thank you for your kindness to his child." "You can not wear that dress from here. How dare you, Olive, touch one of Miss Margaret's dresses?" C Indeed, Mrs. Chester, that dress came from this trunk," Olive said, pointing to that which had been brought in. "It is my child's dress." " Give me mine and take it, then. I shall want this no more. Papa gave me one corner in his box  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7507-00000018"/> 32        FAYE MAR. to have always in readiness for a sudden journey, and this was in it; you can have it." And with the words, all the light in her eyes seemed to die. Mrs. Chester passed into the little dressing- room beyond. She had not been there since the week after Margaret's death. .She opened a ward- robe, and there hung a soft gray dress, that one which she thought had been taken by Olive. For one instant a tide of hot blood rushed into Mrs. Chester's face, and she hid it in the folds of the dress, but David's voice pierced even into the dressing-room, and hastily closiing the wardrobe,. she went out. The proud woman was fiercely humbled, and by her own words ; her anger changed into something deeper ; it looked like undying hate, as she said, "You can leave, Miss Mar, I will detain you no longer in my house." And she threw the door open. DRvid Chester entered. He encountered that terrible look in his mother's face, and, man as he was, he trembled before it. When he spoke, she was gone. Faye Mar mnvec a few steps toward the door, and again that peculiar contraction took place which had preceded the fall upon the rocks. Divid Chester saw the faltering figure, and before it had time to fall, it was laid back upon the dead Margaret's bed.   FAYE MAR.         33 -' She has eaten nothing since last night. 0 M:. Chn3sfter! please do not leave her again-pray d) not!" plealel Olive, gently stroking back the hair from the dead-white temples. "Fear not, Olive, I will not." With the words, the fishe3rman's daughter had departed. Scarcely a mnmnnt, it seemed, was she gone, when she re- turne3d trembling and sobbing, and whispered: N'EI. David, tell me what I can do; Mrs. Chester took from me the cup on the stairs, and told me to give nothing more of hers to this " "There! there! Olive, hush!" and for a mo- ment all was silent within the room, David Ches- ter bending over the still features of this girl, who, twenty-four hours earlier, had not come into the horizon of his life ; :and now-for her sake was it, or for humanity's sake?-he was about to do that, from which he would have shrunken as from a dis- honorable deed, only one day earlier. "Olive, I am going out, to lock you in here a few minutes.  You will trust me, and not be alarmed; try your utmost to bring back Miss Mar; here are all the restoratives you need." There was a world of trust in the gentle face, all flushed with feeling and tears, that turned not one instant from the pallid little figure before her. David Chester met his mother in the hall, where she was walking up and down, her features al- ,  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7507-00000019"/> 34        FAYE MAR. most distorted with wrath, and her muscles all at fullest tension from the working of the evil spirit within.. "Mother!" said her son, walking on by her side, C do you remember the day Margaret died in- the room up-stairs?" "How dare you mention my Margaret's name to me, you- unworthy to be her brother, unwor- thy of your name." "Mother," he went on, not giving way to a feel- ing of his own, "will you be just to our Margaret in being just to this poor young girl, so thrown upon our kindness and care? How do you know that she might not be to you, in your loneliness, a second Margaret, if she lived? But I fear she will not live. I appeal to you, a mother, my mother!" (and an accent of almost tenderness crept into his voice) " to fulfill your duty toward this motherless, fatherless child." "You have taken charge of her - you are emi- nently fit for the duty - you are bringing credit on the family. Attend her by all means ; I advise it, it looks well." "Mother, you have spoken. I will, and you may not interfere." For the first time in Mrs. Chester's life, she stood in awe of a human being. She knew in that moment that there was a will in David Chester    FAYE tAR.         35 that was stronger than her own; it burned in one long, steady blaze out of his eyes. "Mother, go to your own room,- and in this thing I will be master in my house," (it was the first time the words " my house" had escaped his lips). c Whatever is necessary to Miss Mar's re- covery must be done without hindrance from you." The evening twilight was just beginning when -the physician made his visit to the pearl-room. Faye Mar lay on the pillow, breathing, living, but in the long, deep sleep of utter exhaustion, now and then Olive gently touching the parched lips with water. "It is such a blessing that she watched last night on the rock; a nature like hers would have died, but for this physical weariness. When she awakes, let her follow her own inclination, what- ever it may be," said the doctor. "She begged to go to the shore again as soon as she came to consciousness to-day," said David Chester. "Then   take her there, if it is at midnight; only watch her closely. Where is your mistress, Olive? Tell her I would like to see her." "I shall love that doctor as long as I live," whispered Olive to herself, as she trod the lono corridor to Mrs. Chester's private apartments, no longer afraid of any thing in that-house.  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7507-00000020"/> 36        FAYE MAR. Olive knocked and waited, knocked and waited, until she feared the doctor would growl with im- patience, for he had a way of growling that was sometimes very effective. At last she tried the door. The room was vacant. A knock upon an inner door met no response. That room, likewise, was without Mrs. Chester. Olive returned with the report that Mrs. Chester was not in her rooms -not in the house. "I noticed that your mother was a good deal agitated this morning. Perhaps she is in the grounds; I will walk about and see. And the doctor touched again the little telegraph from the heart that told life's progress in Faye Mar; then laying back the hand with almost tenderness, the old man felt for his handkerchief, but his tobacco- box coming first, he reserved the tears for another time, and searched the grounds for Mrs. Chester. He did not find her. She was not found when the moon came up. Marararet's clock was wound that night. It had ceased to tick in the very hour of her death, and the ivory hands still pointed the hour. The little maid Olive was fast asleep when the clock struck for twelve, but Martha, the old nurse of the Ches- ters, kept her watch in the pearl-room, while David Chester kept his in the grounds below, waiting for the return of his mother. Save Mr.   FAYE MAR.        37 Chester and Olive, not one of the household knew that Mrs. Chester was not sleeping in her room. At this hour Faye Mar suddenly awoke, and, as before, with the vague, bewildering thought that she had neglected to watch and wait for her father's coming. Olive was at her side. She spoke gently, as to a little child just come out of sleep; she held a cup of milk to her lips, and said, "Drink this, and we will go down to Storm- Cliff, you and I; the moon is bright, we can see a great way out to sea.". Faye Mar could not resist the tender touch and the promise; just as she had left India to go to school that she might be a companion instead of a care to her father, so now she drank the cup as a step in the way to reach him. Doubtless the little pony waiting in the stables had wondered why he wore a harness through the night, and perchance he wondered yet more that he should be driven down the cliff-road at mid- night and made fast to the gnarled old cherry-tree that stood the nearest to the sea. Neither Faye Mar nor Olive saw the dark spot on Storm-Cliff that fixed David Chester's vision as they came near to it. He knew full well what it meant. His mother had come down to meet them there. 20  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7507-00000021"/> 38        FAYE MAR. CHAPTER II. THE HOURS ON THE ROCK. DAVID CHESTER knew that his mother had been waiting .on' Storm-Cliff for hours-knew that she had there been brooding over the gloomy depths in her nature, until, out of them, had sprung into being, forms of reality, that, for the- time, were clothed with all the power of reality. He had encountered the spirit that seemed to take posses- sion of her and battled with it often, but the strug-  gle had been with her only. He paused a moment on the beach, then said: "Will you mind being left here with Olive five minutes--ten, perhaps-- and not fear if I am away a half-hour?" He led them to a spot on the shore, where the summit of Storm-Cliff could not be seen by moonlight, saying, ' Let me find you just here, when I return." The moon rode triumphantly out from  the cloud-webs that had for hours been trying to enfold it just at the omenoet David Chester appeared on A   FAYE MAR.         39 the summit of the rock. And here the rock itself needs a bit of description. A range of hills came out from a mid-land range of mountains with a vain endeavor to reach the sea-coast. For a hun- dred miles inland the hills grew higher and higher, until the grandeur of the mountain range could be seen from afar; while, a dozen miles fromn the ocean, they had dwindled to rocky mounds and wooded heights; but there, jugt at the very border- land, the highland spirit had asserted itself, and tossed up  Storm-Cliff-solid rock, rising a hun- dred feet in sheer precipice over the foam-lipped ocean, and, landward, falling back gradually, in a manner to be accessible at a point near Cliff-Lane. Northward and   southward, the cliff was broken into masses of rock, with caverns and fissures, through which, in storms, the waves roared and tossed their spray. The cliff summit was nearly level; there were little table-like elevations here and there upon the surface, from which the pointed rocks lying below might   have been cut off in sharp winds.   One could not help the wish that they might be brought up and fitted on here and there, so exactly did the planes of their surfaces seem to agree. Mrs. Chester sat upon a   rock near the verge of the precipice, so near, that, as David Chester ap- proached the motionless figure, his heart beat fast  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7507-00000022"/> 40        FAYE MAR. under the- fear that she might have fallen asleep. He feared to speak, almost to breathe, lest a sud- den awakening might throw her over the verge. Down at the base of the cliff, a hundred feet below, the surf was beating its never-silent march, and any army, coming up, might not be heard. Clad in stately black, Mrs. Chester sat, with her head resting on folded arms. It was an attitude of sleep; but if David Chester could have seen the two large, cool, gray eyes peering out at him from under an angle in one of the folded arms, he would have felt no anxiety concerning a sudden awaking. She had long been watching for his coming, in just that position, hence, she did not move, not even when her son had placed himself on the narrow edge of rock between herself and the sea. He laid his hand upon her head--"Mother!" TNo answer. "Mother!" "Don't call me mother! never let me hear you call- me mother again!" came the response, and now the full flow of moonlight surged in upon her face, showing every line of white in her hair, every wrinkle of time in her once fair face, as she lifted it from off her bent arms. They were stiffened by the long, tense holding in one position, and the air of the night. David- Chester knelt down on the rock, and   FAYE MAR.        41 took one of his mother's cold hands in his own, trying to warm it, without speaking. "Go away from me, go back to that girl, that adventurer's daughter, that you have taken into your care: go, I say!"And while she spoke Mrs. Chester, with a sudden motion, released her hand and pointed down the sands, in the direction from whence he had come. "Mother!" the word came full and clear, as if she had been speaking kindly words, "I intend to do my duty by you, and by her." "Duty!" a ghastly smile shed its sickly glare over her face for an instant, "you talk to me of duty! If your father were alive, you would not talk to me in this style, or take that girl into his house." "No, mother, you are right; for in the one case you would need neither help nor care from me; in the other, there would be no need, for father him- self would have taken her in. "Suppose, mother," he went   on, "suppose Margaret, traveling in a foreign country with my father, and he had met the fate this poor gentle- man has done, what treatment would you ask for Margaret at a mother's hands? Are you giving to Miss Mar all that you would ask for your child?" As the words " your child " dropped with almost a  new tenderness out from David Chester's lips,  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7507-00000023"/> 42        FAYE MAR. he still kneeling at her feet, she looking qurce past him out upon the great, black reach of waters, the midnight sky bending over all, the air tremu- lous with the beat of waters, a small, white hand was pit upon Mrs. Chester's, and Faye Mar was kneeling by the side of David Chester. For a few seconds there was silence. Her com- ing had not been seen, had not been felt, until she was beside them. "I am an intruder, but, Mrs. Chester, I came with a purpose," and Faye Mar fixed her hand with a clasp so firm upon Mrs. Chester's that there was no escape. "I have been ill in your house to-day; you know the cause; you know that my father is even now under these waters in the dread- ful somewhere, that I can not find. If I could only find him, if I could only carry him home, as he carried my mother in the first journey I ever made with- him, I would go from this place to- morrow; but he is here, and I can not find him. Have you no pity for me? I never loved any one but my father, he told me not to; he told me he must be going to and fro, and if he ever found his D.

And she sprang to her feet, pointing far away ocean- ward; "shall I, with it beating ever after him, plunge from this cliff into the sea?" David Chester drew her, swift as an arrow, from the awful abyss. Mrs. Chester had arisen; she saw the motion; she murmured, 1"I wish she had done it!" Faye Mar alone heard the murmured    words; David Chester heard only the throbbings of his own heart as, with his arm still holding fast about her, there beat out of his lips, close to her ear, the words, "Give it to me-give me your heart!" Rash man that he was! but there are times and seasons when surely spirits that are strong, if not stronger than we, come in and assert possession. Such an one, spoke through his lips. "Miss Mar," said Mrs. Chester, walking to her son's side and  almost Withdrawing his arm from around her, "I desire you to leave me and my son forever; come not between us from this time.

I came to tell you that you need anticipate meeting me no more, that I would not enter your house again; but now I say nothing. I make no promises for the future. I only ask, in parting, one favor: Will you release Olive from your service? I like her, I want her, I' -need her; pray let her be with me." "She is -spoiled already. You can take her. She is no longer fit for my service." ' Mother let me take you home. You are scarce fit to stand." And David Chester held out his arm. For an instant Mrs. Chester drew back, as if disdaining to take it, then fixed her own in it with a grasp like that of one drowning, and swept her stately figure past Faye Mar with a motion that even her son could not resist. Little, frightened Olive, who could not compre- hend any thing beyond the belief that Mrs. Chester was a very crazy woman, was crouching behind a rock, where she had been waiting for Miss Mar; but the clear gray eyes, that on that night seemed to see every thing, espied her fluttering garments, and called, "Olive! come to me." She obeyed the call; but Mrs. Chester did not stay a footstep as she said, "You are no longer in my service. I will send your clothes to the vil- lage."   VAYE MAS.        45 "Thank you ma'am!"And Olive did not wait, for Mrs. Chester to disappear before she climbed the ridge that separated her from Miss Mar. The young lady was sitting on the very rock so lately occupied,. her thoughts gone back to her father; and yet, and still, her eyes were tearless. Olive could not endure that dreadful calmness any longer. Scarcely knowing why she did it, she began to tell of the boat for which she had waited, going over the night and the storm and the wait- ing, with a beauty and a pathos in her low-toned voice that set Faye Har first a-listening, then a-hearing, then made her feel an interest in the story, and at last when, with the words, "And I've been waiting ever since, and now I know he never can come home to me," Olive closed, her words dropping down into a sob. Faye Mar threw her arms around the neck of the fisherman's daugh- ter with a wail of passion, crying out, "They shall come back, and we will wait together," then wept and sobbed, until Olive, to calm the grief which she seemed to fear as much as the calmness that went before, began to repeat verses of Scrip- ture that she had heard ministers say over at the bedsides of the dying.

No one, save He, who hears always and allwhere, heard the words of the poor old man (who, forty years before; had come to shore with an empty boat that had gone out in the morning, freighted with the gold of childhood) as he went from the little harbor-entrance, where the fishing-vessel rode. He was left on the coast alone, when the me; walked away behind David Chester, lest his arms should grow too- weak for the burden that was laid upon them. The little vessel was safely anchored, and thereafter the men went homeward, to tell the story to wakeful wives and children. There was a little cabin that night standing just where the utmost outlook upon the sea could be gained within village limits. In that cottage, waked and waited, afisherman's wife.

It was for that very call of "Martha," that she thought she had been waiting. "It's Robert," and the bolt was withdrawn. "You are late to-night; is it because-(the rush- light cast its radiance up into the old man's face) has any thing been happening? Say, man, speak! ' "Martha, are ye well to-night, right strong and all yerself?" "Yes, man, I'm well enough. What ails ye, that ye ask?" "Hush, wife speak soft." They had lodgers in the room above; no children's feet had gone up the stairs, since the waves had closed over their head- of-gold, two-score years before. She whispered, "Tell me quick, Robert, there's no bad news for me, when I see ye with my own eyes." And he found time to kiss her, before he said: "I want you, Martha, and the man Isaac, to go out with me a bit to-night, in the Dimple." "Out in, the Dimple on the black waters to- night! why not get the men to go with ye?" "Martha! you've known me long, longer'n the men I fish with, and even you'll tell me it's a   FAYE MAR.         49 fool's errand I':D1 b1ounl on; but I'll e'en go, wifh, if it's alone'." "What is the errand, man?" "We lost a man overboard to-night, Martha.' "Lost a man overboard, and stand ]here talknizy! Why, I'll ring the horn till all the village is upn and away in boats."' She seized the fisherman's horn. 'Before a sound could issue fi'om it, her husband held her hand and the trumpet, fast in his own. "Listen, Martha!" he said c" it was the English gentleman who came up last night to the village; ye reckoned on the winsome face of the lass, ye'll remember; and won- dered if the child's had been like it, in years." "Don't, Robert! you'll make me  of no use in the boat; when did he fall overboard?"' "In the squall; all eyes were away landward. When 'twas over, the gentleman was missing, no one saw him fall, no one heard a sound. Give me a bite to eat, wife, and some strong tea, if it's in the pot, and we'll be going." "  Where to, Robert?" "Martha, wasn't ye awake and thinkin' when I  spoke by the window?" Well, I'm thinkin', and  it tells me to go. Wilt call Isaac?"

The "'man Isaac" lived alone. He was the strength of the coast; with an arm ready for any labor; with a heart brimming with hu- manity, whose ruling passion was to save life; who gloried ins being " all alone in the world," for the reason, that if he periled his life for another, there would be none left to mourn for him if he lost it. Like Martha, he must have been waking and waiting; for not two minutes from the time she called he was outside, saying, "What, Martha? Is it on the land or the sea?" "Come quick, and hear Robert's story," she said, leading the way across the strip of sand and garden. The "man Isaac" heard the story told in few words. "You are to search the Pinnacle," he said. Robert Sing, grasped his hand without speaking, and the three went to the Dimple. This woman, Martha Sing, was afraid of the ocean; her soul had never gone out into her hus- band's occupation. Since the child went down, a feeling, as akin to hate as any her kind heart had known, lived in her, toward the sea: with a secret trembling she went down to the place of its   iAYE MAR.          51 power.  Her husband well knew her worth, her self-possession, her obedience to orders, and, know- ing these qualities, was content to have her in the Dimple. The old, old beat of the ocean all around; mid- night shut down over land and sea; the moon rid-' ing the cloud-waves, even as the Dimple struggled with black waves below. Three thousand miles of water before them, se- cure homes just behind, and yet out into the region of tempest; over the battle-field, where the sounds of victory never die away; out into, it may be, death, to search a lone rock for a life, went these three souls.       i, Outside, there ran a ledge of rocks that proved fine fishing-ground to those who knew the secret of putting into the  same angle Storm-Cliff and the white spire of a church, two miles inland. This under-ocean ledge was a continuation of the mountain range of which- Storm-Cliff was the last grand- result. Out at sea, full three miles from land and in the line of the ledge, nature had thrown up a rock, that stood out from the waters in calms. In high storms, it was surged over by wave-crests and spray. At low tide, small cones of rock surrounded it; they were almost counterparts of those that had fallen from  the top of Storm- Cliff.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7507-00000028"/> 52        FAYE MAR. Going homeward that night, this man, Robert Sing, had thought of the rocks, and the fact that before Major Mar had been missed, their boat had passed within a furlong of them; but, on mention- inol the possibility to the men with him, they reasoned it down with all the arguments of muscle, wind, and tide, and to each of these Robert Sing assented. Still he held the possibility fast in his heart, and went home with it to his wife. She, good woman, did not repeat the arguments to him; nor would she, had she known them. From a headland up the coast there gleamed the light from a light-house. Down the coast, a little out at sea, miles away, flashed a red some- thing, that told where an island lay. That little toiling boat and the two lights-all else, above and below, was given to nature, in her midnight. He who held the Dimple to her course turned now and then to look at the light growing more dim with every wave passed over. The woman sat motionless, with her whole nature in that intense state of alertness that such women alone know how to subdue to useful purposes. From the moment the huge crest of Storm-Cliff faded from vision, she had fixed her eyes intently for Pinnacle Rock. The man Isaac held his post, solid as a statue; of what was passing in his mind, no man might know.   FAYE MAR.         53 Another look to the northward, and the light gleamed out to the westward of the polar star. The Dimple turned-the night-wind fluttered across her sail.. She was floating whither current and winds might agree. The woman glanced toward her husband in- quiringly, the man bowed his head approvingly, but the three held silence, looking eastward all. Nothing but water in- any direction could be seen. "B Keep off a bit," spoke Isaac. The sail filled, the boat turned to the sea; the waves grew higher, the wind blew in sharp, quick gusts. "Robert," spoke a gentle woman's voice at the helmsman's ear, "' Robert, I can't go any further. I'm sure the rock lies landward." She was right. It stood to the westward, the waves tearing up its precipitous sides, eager to beat it into nothingness. In the light of day a mariner would' have considered long, before mak- ing the approach to the Pinnacle. At night, the Dimple rode fearlessly up to the rock, the sail dropped down the mast, the rattle of the hoops scarcely heard, amid the roar of waters. The grapnel was thrown again and again by Isaac at the rock, but would not hold. At last, he relinquished the effort and sprang from the boat against its wave-washed side, falling back like a dead weight upon the Dimple, only to make  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7507-00000029"/> 54        FAYE MAR. a second spring at his foe, and to conquer. He disappeared over the rock. The woman crept up to her husband; the time was summer, the night not cold, yet a touch as of ice, stole into the old fisherman's palm; it was only her voice that he heard saying, "Robert, if we are lost, do you think I'd find our baby any- where in this blackness. I'd be content then-" "Wife, don't ye .know, haven't ye heard many times, that our baby's no longer little; it's nigh on forty years since that time, Martha: don't grieve so." "I'm not grieving," (she was fluttering like a leaf in the wind) "but, Robert, I want him a baby; I want to bring him up. I don't want to believe he's a man grown, and all without his mother." And he comforted her with what comfort his ignorant mind and loving heart might give, ending with the words, "We'll trdst Him, Mar- tha." Surely it was a place in which to trust the Lord, and him only. The "man Isaac," was in his element. He reveled in that climb up the wet, dripping front of Pinnacle rock, covered as it was with barnacles and rock-weed; he went down to the lower clefts, where, into the dark fissures, the moonlight did not penetrate; he kneeled and felt with his hands   FAYE MAR.        55 into the dark reaches where the white crests tossed. Once he stood up and called. Robert Sing did not hear the call, for the wind bore the sound seaward and onward. The pointed rocks that had once been parts of Pinnacle itself, were discernible, when the light of the moon fell upon them. With a wild cry of exultation the man leaped the water that separated the rock from one of them. That dark mass was too compact for rock- weed, too high for drift of sea-weed; not a spot for a bit of wreck to come to. It lay motionless. He turned it to the light and saw a face, cut and bleeding. It looked ghastly in the moon rays, but this man was not afraid of the dead, he had been often alone with them; besides, there was the possibility of latent life. His hand was instinct with courage and warmth, (it seemed to him such a natural and easy thing to be alive, that he would, had the thing been possi- ble, have conducted of his own keenly aliye being, into this man's bosom) as he thrust it under the dripping wrappings that lay over his heart. Possibly, I do not know that it was not so, this Isaac's hand, with its throbbing pulses, caught and held and kindled the spark of ebbing life at its last second of existence. I only know that he held it over the heart with a warm, gentle pressure  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7507-00000030"/> 56        FAYE AnR. until he fancied he felt a return of warmth. He gathered up the limbs of the man out of the sea -that was washing them to and fro with the filling tide, putting them on the rock, then leaped the water again and ran up the Pinnacle. Robert Sing saw him standing there, clearly cut against the eastern sky. He remembered it hours later. "You can't get the boat around, the sea is too high. You must come up the rock." Martha Sing started up from her bent position, the vision of her baby vanishing into heaven, from whence it had come. "Oh! he's found him. I'm so glad I came with ye. Robert, tell me what to do." He told her-she listening as intently as one who -hears of the way to the celestial city-how to keep the boat fast by the rock. She closed her eyes a moment, that she might not see if he fell, then opened them, and was alone.  She could have counted every heart-beat as she grasped the tiller, not daring to relax one muscle from its rigid hold, lest the boat should glide by frofi the rock. Oncd there came a voice over the rock saying, "All right, hold fast, we're coming soon;" then the woman was lonelier than before-the time seemed longer.   FAYE MAR.        57 O you man Isaac! you Robert Sing, bending and bearing your burden as other men could not! do you not feel the veering wind? did you not feel that strong sighing out of the north? Is the Dimple nearer to nature than are you, that the utmost strength of Martha Sing alone holds her fast to the rock, and you do not know, do not think? The "man Isaac" does not shrink back from the water, as he goes feeling his way down for a foundation below whereon to stand, while they carry over the motionless burden. A shriek-a cry, but only winds and waves hear it, goes up from the Dimple, as the boat starts into motion, grating along the barnacled edge of Pinnacle Rock, and then, with only a help- less woman in it, is out on the ocean. Going up the rock, Robert Sing rubbed his eyes suddenly; even that motion did not make vision clear enough to, reflect what was not there to be reflected-the mast of the Dimple. lie dropped his hold and sprang, climbing eager- ly to the summit. Down below -was vacancy, with the beating of the sea that tried in vain to fill the place. "Fool, fool that I was!" he cried, "and not to feel this north wind." And in that second came the memory of the little talk with his wife about their  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7507-00000031"/> 58        FAYE MAR, dead baby that he had had; and his own words," We xvill trust H im, Martha," fell like a benediction on hris heart. Daylight came. The mnan Isaac was doing his  utmost to keep life within the mangled body be- foire him. Robert Sing was watching the dim speck floating farther and farther away to the southward, that might-.possibly be the Dimple. At mid-day, life was still in Major Mar--he had. spoken. The speck was out of sight. No sail was seen. Still the man kept his eyes. eagerly going over and over the horizon's rim to find some speck thereon. IN THE VILLAGE. The day was dying. No food on the rock- none'in the Dimple. Plenty in the little fishing village, not six miles away, where a group of fish- ormen were gathered. The sea had been too rough for their occupation that day, and when and where have fishermen been known to be industrious on the land? They lounged the afternoon away, but the time was come for the evening meal at home, to be in readiness. "Westerly to-morrow, by the looks," said one, as the group was breaking up. "I wonder where Sing's gone, his wife too; haven't seen theml to-day; half believe that they   FAYE 31AB,        59 went off in the night." It was one of the lodgers who had spoken. 'The Dimple's gone too, as I live," said an- other. The second speaker was one of the men who had been in the boat from whence Major Mar had been lost. "Boys, there's work ahead to- night; Robert Sing's gone to Pinnacle Rock, I know it, by the glance of his eyes when he con- sented not to turn back. Who'll go?" That little group of men would have floated Storm-Cliff out to sea, had the thing been possi- ble, in behalf of the old man and his wife; and not a voice but responded " ay!" to the cry, "who'll go?" TIIE CRUISE OF THE DIMPLE. That one cry for aid that went out upon wind and wave from Martha Sing, was the last she ut- tered toward man that day. From   that moment, she was alone with God.  He had never been so real to her before. In some mxaniler he had seemed to be nigh Robert, so that when he had breathed out his human wants in words, and she had list- ened and tried to utter the same words, then, for that time, she could believe that he heard; but as the day grew up into light and betuty, and Robert was away upon the sea, there was nothing but Simple, work to do in her -cabiq, vaam she thought,  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7507-00000032"/> b0i FSAYE MAR. the Good Spirit must have gone out with her hus- band upon the waters, and, in her unselfish heart, she was content to have it so; she felt that he( needed Him more. But now, she was cast awav from all that bound her to the land, and every pulse was a beat of prayer for his help. Up and down over the huge waves, in the break- ing of the day, went the boat, driven by the wind andi tide, a little further out on the ocean, a little. further down the coast with every moment; the tide had turned, it was ebbing fast at sunrise. The poor old eyes of Martha Sing were fixed on Pinnacle Rock, until it half seemed as if, of their own force, they must have drawn that- pebble out after her. She knew the figure, so like a bird on it, was her husband; she had seen him standing there at the dawn. With a transport of joy the woman felt that the -wind was dying away; the billows rolled without curling, she no longer shrank back from the depth at the wall of water that rose before her with every wave. But the awful distance that was growing, growing, between the boat and the rock! On wave- tops she could scarcely see the Pinnacle; less and less it became, until the old eyes closed in weary pain, and a sob burst from the parted lips. Storm-Cliff itself went out, before the island came into view.   FAYE MAR.         61 For a little while Martha Sing sat still, the tears stealing  down the furrows in her cheeks, at the thought of that rock in the sea, and the three men who might starve upon it, unless she was found to, t..ll their story. The duty of being found, suddenly arose before her; she must float somewhere,  she maust make herself seen. The first attempt to use the tiller was fatal, the rudder was unshipped, and Martha Sing was no sailor; she laid it down in despair. Possibly the sail could be raised, she would try. The dark stone light-house came up like a mon- ument on the horizon at the moment the woman made the effort. She could not lift the sail, but, possibly, if she could only get a streamer to the mast-head, it might attract human attention. The world was fast fading from Martha Sing; already the life of yesterday, and the work to do in her little cabin, seemed like a fable told to her in childhood. There was only one thing left at home that seemed real-it was the. well.   She could look down into that; she could see the clear, cool water at the bottom, and the stones mossed over. Once she put up her hands with the motion of drawing at the rope. They fell back and began to fumble at the fastening of her shawl. It was black. She thought it meant in the ocean world   ' dreadful things," and she would use it for a signal. -3:'  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7507-00000033"/> 62        FAYE MAR. Reader! it was Martha Sing's Sunday shawl- the only " nice shawl" she had ever owned. The fishing village was a primitive place. As -et the turmoil from the great hotel down the tcoast, had not swept through the town, into the meeting-house, whose white spire lay somewhere to the westward. Martha Sing had worn that shawl for more than twenty years; it had been, as it were, rooted into her Sunday life; her shoulders would not have rested warmed and secure under any other covering from May till November. Ye who change apparel with the years and months, know nothing of Martha Sing's emotions, as she drew from around her her faithful black shawl, and, with a bowie knife, made a slit in it. How her nerves quivered, as the wind, blowing cool in the morning, out of the north, shook the shawl in her hands, as they rent it in twain. Patiently she toiled, tying together the frag- ments of fringe, that not an inch of the signal should b3 lost-all this time floating out on the three thousand miles of water. Not a moment did Martha Sing hesitate to cut the sail from the hoops. As rope after rope gave way before the knife, her spirit arose within her; her husband could no more have done the deed without strong emotion, than she have torn her S' Sunday shawl" in twain, exultingly.   FAYE MAR.        63 The last hoop was set free, the signal was made fast, and the black streamer rode up the blue aisle of heaven. A smile broke over the features of the fisher- man's wife, as she said aloud: "There, Robert! I've given my Sunday shawl to save you." She sat down, tired with the effort and anxiety to get it into place, and began to look up at it and to bless the breeze that yet blew free enough to float the streamer. She wondered if Robert could see it from the rock; hoped he might; that he should know she was doing what she could to save him. Nearer and nearer came the island; the house of the keeper was seen; the rocks upon the shore came out. The precious mnoments were speeding. Was there no one on that island to see the Dimple -to see that woman, standing there beneath the black flag, holding fast to the mast with one arm, whilst the other was tossed to and fro? THE LIGHT-KEEPER'S LITTLE DAUGHTER. Now and then it had chanced that a visitor came to the island from the Beach Hotel; but the dis- tance, and the fear of high seas that were ever at home on that coast, made such an event one of rare occurrence and especial interest o tl e family there,  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7507-00000034"/> "        FAYE -MAn. Ailee Lee, the light-keeper's daughter, had known no world beyond the bit of rocky land and the rocky ledges that stretched out and away like the fine points of a star-fish from the island; and when a vis- itor came--as one had done the week before-and took her in his arms and told her pleasant stories, she deemed that of such as he, were made the many people of the world. But the stories, they were beyond her compehrension, for there were things "mixed up " in them that she had never known. Extreme was the surprise of the gentleman, who thought he had made a strong impression on the child's mind by a story of Bessie Brown and her rabbit, to hear Ailee say, when he had ended, a What is it, sir ; does it bark?" The day following, the gentleman made an es- pecial trip, with a rabbit passenger in his boat, for Ailee Lee. Sir Rabbit did not take kindly to his island life. He had not yet learned that cabbages are not grown where rock-weed thrives; and at the mo- ment the Dimple floated the nearest to the island, Ailee Lee was down on her knees, right in the midst of the oozing weed, looking among the rocks for her pet. Something, that mysterious something, that turns us at will, ca tsed the child to glance up- ward a moment.   xAYE 3 MAR.        '65 She saw the boat quite well, saw the black streamer floating, saw the figure holding by the mast, but Ailee Lee had seen boats ever since her eyes had opened on the sea.- The rabbit was something new, and the boat passed out fi'om her mind, she delving under rocks and weed for the bit of animated fur. Even when Martha Sing knew the island was passed, she thought not of herself. All alone! no land in sight, save the mountains, so far away, with the black- flag hanging straight down the nast, as if it were no use to float with no one there to see it, the woman lay down in the- boat, covered up her face that she might not see 'the waters, and-tried to think. It was near noonday.  There were but three pictures in the woman's brain: first, the three men on the rock; then, the well ; and, standing on the low shelf in her little pantry at home, a stone jar, filled with bread, (she had made it only yesterday) the five loaves seeming like so many stepping-stones back to the world, if she could but reach them. Possibly it was unnatural; another woman might have kept awake, but Martha Sing'fell asleep; it must be kept in remembrance that she had been "waking and thinking" when her hus- band called at the window, in the night.  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7507-00000035"/> "        FAYE MAR. While she slept, the tide turned, the evening wind sprang up; where the Dimple floated, it was west wind; in, near the coast, the air moved lazily down, still out of the north. Ailee Lee, tired of the rocks, tired of her rabbit, pattered her little feet along the stone floor, climbed to the "settle," arranged the birds and flowers on the chintz pillows where she could see them, and somehow, presently she got them all mixed up with her eye-lashes that floated down, lower and lower, until the child was fast asleep. The afternoon sun flooded the stone floor of the little room; lazily the breakers moved in over the rocks, scarce deigning to feel the tidal force that beat them upward. The " keeper" was up in the lighthouse making all things bright for the night to come. His wife sat near the " settle," sewing, with now and then a mother-glance at Ailee, sleeping there. There came into the child's sleep something that disturbed it; she gave two or three little moans, then suddenly started up, with her eyes widely open, and her little sun-browned face full of trouble. "Mother, I saw it, going way out to sea, and there wasn't any sail, only a long black string tied way up top to the mast. I was looking for Bunny, and I guess it went away; I'm going to see."   FAYE MAR.       '  67 ' You have been dreaming, Ailee, never mind it." "I'm going to see," said Ailee. The mother smiled and sewed on, while the little feet ran to and fro over the rocks calling "Papa!"Not finding him, getting no answer, Ailee ventured into the entrance of the light-house. The place was for- bidden  to her, because of its dangerous, open stairs. She called, and  I think the man  was lonely, for, in answer, he went down, and, with Ailee perched on his shoulder, climbed back to his work. She was delighted, and told her story. Mr. Lee did not consider it a fiction, woven in dream-land; so he questioned Ailee closely, and, even as he wrought the lantern, he glanced out occasionally oceanward. The sun was- getting near the horizen.  The lamp was ready. "Come, child, we'll go down," said the father, and, in going, gave one parting glance. Ailee cried out, "There, papa! don't you   see something?  " Only a  speck on the waste. No one noticed that the light was not burning at sunset in that light-house. The United States government never knew that that keeper was un- faithful to his trust, for his wife went up in the early gloaming and did his duty for him'.

The soft west wind streamed out the banner of black, whose fringe was longer than at the morn- ing. Crouched in the bottom of the boat, sat the fisherman's wife, not daring to look, since she had awakened and found the land in sight, lest she should find it fading again. A tremor of wildest agony shot through her soul and body, at a sound she heard: crouching there, it cast her with a mighty throe upon the shore of time again. She raised her head, she stood up in the boat; she waved her arms to and fro. Out of her parched lips, there ran a psalm of thanksgiving; the life-boat was less than a mile distant; it was hailing her; she was saved! The light-keeper's little daughter, Ailee Lee, had saved Martha Sing, the fisherman's wife. "It's me, papa. Mamma's up in the light," said a little voice, whose owner the father almost stumbled over at the foot of the light-house, for clouds were gathering over the moon, when the Dimple came to land. The keeper's wife could not light the burner; she was doing what she could, holding a candle close to the great reflector.   FAYE MAR.        69 CHAPTER    IV. COMNG OUT FROM THE HEDGE. INTO the life of man come moments when consciousness, beyond the then action of the mind, is lost ; when the avenues by which material sensations and external impressions visit the in- dividual seem choked; when the sunlight is not felt; when storms pass unheeded; when hunger is as if it existed not. Such moments came to David Chester in his mother's presence on the night he conducted her home from Storm-Cliff. The words that were spoken between the mother and her son were never revealed to mortals. After moments of silence, Mrs. Chester sud- denly said, "David, do you not- hear a knock at the hall door?" David Chester did not hear the sounds that rang through the house; did not hear his mother's words.. In those hours his powers of reception had been tried to the utmost; they lay dormant then.  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7507-00000037"/> 70        FAYE MAt.  Mrs. Chester shook his arm.  "David," she said, as nearly frightened as her nature permitted,  and, for the instant, willing to call him back by  any means in her power, " it may be Olive! Pos-  m sibly something   ha happened to Miss Mar!" It may have been the motion, it may have been   the mention of Faye Mar's name, that penetrated where other words could not gain access, that caused return to the outward world. He hastened to answer the summons. "Dear me, Mr. Chester," said a fisherman's voice at the door, "I thought I should never malke J any one hear; they've found a man on Pinnacle Rock, been there a day and a night, is just alive, and that's all. What I come for, is to tell ye they're going to land down to the cliff, and bring;  him up, by hand. Robert Sing and 'Man Isaac  say he won't last to get to the hotel. Hen mst come up here. May be you'll have a place got ready." "What is it I hear?" exclaimed Mrs. Chester, who had followed her son, and had only half-way learned what the breathless man told. "Mother, it is Major Mar, I think."  "Yes, that's the name. Robert Sing said he'  a daughter here," said the man.         ] A strange flow of something passed like a flood, half of light and half of shadow, across Mrs. Ches- ter's face.                   i I   PAYE MAR.        71 "David," she said, go down and meet them; will make ready." For the first time in his life David Chester )ubted his mother. With all her whims, with 1 her moods, there had been a certain something lat foretold what might follow; but for this iange there had been no parallel in the past. He went up to her, standing in the shadow, and ;tempted to take her hand. - She withdrew it. Thank you, mother, I will go," he said, and a "nute later was away. The little pony, who'went at racing speed down torm-Cliff lane, seemed all too slow for David' hester's thoughts. He was anxious to reach the iff before the boats came in. This man, who had brought the news, had been nded from one of the boats which left Pinnacle ock in search of the missing Dimple, at a point clow Storm-Cliff, and sent across, if by chance 3 might be in time to announce their com-aing. The pony was made fast to the same gnarled Cerry tree, and David Chester was making straight r the cliff when the man caught his arm, saying, It's at Cliff-harbor they mean to get him in." David Chester and the two men trod the sands, ever speaking, until they had climbed the rocks Id looked down into the bit of -water. Now Olive, 'from her out-look, had seen, in the  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7507-00000038"/> 72        FAYE MA, R moonlight, little white sails coming landward, a   * half mile down the beach; and,- in her fear, still gently stroking the temples that throbbed mnder their first sorrow, she had watched and waited for Mr. Chester's return. He came not until the stars  H were paling into the early dawn. Neither Fayea Mar nor Olive saw the little procession winding along the beach, and so on to the cliff-road. David Chester could not comfort the sorrowing, for he had found no comfort in sorrow; but, if there was in life any thing to be done, if material  aid could bring relief, he was ready to proffer it.  He had seen Miss Mar in her grief, and he hesi- tated to turn that grief into joy, lest the reaction should prove fatal. It is written that " joy never H kills." Possibly not; but I think that many human beings have felt that it mighlt. David Chester so felt as he, for the third time that night, drove down Cliff-lane. He tried to put words into a formula that would suit the case; but no ple- pared sentence was of any avail, and he cast the last one aside as he clirbed the cliff. Faye 3Iar's eyes were closed. The first light of day was struggling through night, and fallillng across her face as it rested on Olive. The beating of the surf shut out all other sounds, so that no impression of David Chester's coming was made  until he stood beside them.    FAYE MARn. "Come, Miss Mar!" were all the spoken words. Olive started in bewilderment at the expression in voice aild ftce of the speaker. Miss Mar moved from her long-kept position, and stood erect before him, looking into his eyes an instant, then said: "cc Tell me what it is, Mr. Chester; have they found--his body?" He did not answer. "Pray tell me-something has happened, and I've been promising God, on this rock to-night, that if he would only let my poor father float on shore, I would--" She did not finish the sentence. David Chester interrupted her with the words: "The body is found."'  "Tell me where it is, be quick !" and the little fig- ure of the English girl was half-way down Storm- Cliff before Mr. Chester and Olive overtook it. "Mr. Chester, when did it come on shore? who found him? had--the sharks-touched it?" she turned suddenly to ask. "No, my child, he came on shore down in the little harbor where we went last night." She was hastening that way, but David Chester drew her back, simply saying: "You will find him at my house, he has been carried there." 4 &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7507-00000039"/> 74         :AYE MAR. Just as the entrance was reached, Faye Mar, leaning forward, touched Mr. Chester's arm. "Please, Mr. Chester, if he does not look like himself, I won't see him, for I want to keep my promise to God," she added, almost in a whisper. The whisper was needless, for the little maid Olive was leaning back in the carriage, weeping silently at the thought of her ocean-tossed dead one, whom the wave would never bring to shore. "Do not fear, Miss Mar," Mr. Chester had said, when, in the walk, having emerged from a bit of hedge behind which she had been watching, ap- peared Mrs. Chester, close to the carriage. The day had dawned fully. Mrs. Chester was dressed with the utmost care; her face was so changed that Miss Mar for the instant did not know her, not until David said: "Be careful, mother." "There's no fear, David, he asks for her every moment." One great bound of Faye Mar's heart, and she sat perfectly still. She did not even heed the words Mrs. Chester used. The elegant congratula- tions of that lady were entirely lost upon the little figure which David Chester lifted to the ground. The shock set the wheels of life in motion. Heeding no one, Fay Mar ran into the house. As   PAyE lAR. M. 75 if by instinct, she knew the room where ftey had carried him. She flashed into it, the light in her eyes gleaming, and, before hand or voice could arrest her, she wvas fainting on his bec. I-ler eyes had done their work.   They told her that Ile father lived, and, blinded by too much joy, nature kindly let fall the curtain of unconsciousness. Mrs. Chester found her there, and would have removed her to the pearl-room, but Major Mar forbade them to take her from his sight. There was another meeting at sunrise. Robert Sing would not turn lanclward after his release from the rock until theDimple  was found. The light-keeper was away at the first breath of light to tell on the land that there were men on a rock in the sea. Martha Sing was contented to stay on the island when he told her that he could get to land sooner, with only one in his boat. She was at he landing, to bid him good-speed; the lighi- keeper's little daughter shouting out " good-by," was like a bird twittering in the breaking light of day. On the dawning, out gleamed the     sails of the fishing boats' The life-boat had m et them on tile ocean and told  its story. They, ith life-o in tow, came speeding island-ward. Martha Sing and little Ailee were oan the shore t    o see the boats com e in. &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7507-00000040"/> 76        FAYE MAR. "Mamma," said Ailee, "' I didn't know anybody loved old folks who had white hair." Martha Sing heard the child's words, albeit en- folded in her husband's arms, and tears came into her eyes at the thought of the love that might have been hers, had not death drawn through the dark water-gates, her little head of gold.   FAYE MAR.         " CHAPTER V. MRS. CHESTER AT WORK. FIVE years had passed in the life of David Ches- ter, since the events that have been told took'place, and the night on which he went out into the great gale of the autumn from the presence of his wife with the words with which my story opens.  The breakers roared and thundered in their-i mad en- deavors against their ancient enemy, the land. Fighting his way along the sands, drenched with sea spray and rain, it seemed to this man as if the fire-tipped waves were writing out his life before him. The night was so dark that except in light- ning flashes there seemed nothing beyond the black- aess edged with the fire of the sea. In the five years, these things had happened. No   one knows how the "man Isaac " had bat- tled with death, to save Major Mar, during those lours on Pinnacle- Rock; how he never left him in instant lest he should sink to revive no more. This " man Isaac," of whom no one knew more  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7507-00000041"/> 78        FAYE MAR. than he choose to tell, was possessed with a mania for battling with expiring nature. Had the cir- cumstances of his life made him a healer of men, his skill would have astonished the world. He had restored from drowning more lives than all other persons on the coast, never giving up, until the seal of death was fixed. All through the autumn following, Faye Mar had devoted himself to her father, scarcely leaving his side during the delicious days that stole, like a transit of heaven, across the earth. Her great delight was to win her father to the coast, and to point to Storm-Cliff, and tell him how she had watched his coming there. Sometimes she would leave him on the beach long enough to climb the cliff and perch upon its summit, that he might see how she looked when waiting for him. Coming home from these rambles, David Ches- ter watched Faye Mar wonderingly.  Always dressed in white and wound about with wreathing vines, that she had coaxed from nature, either from tree, or rock, or earth, she had won them, without even a thought of the eyes that watched her going and coming from a window in Storm- Cliff. This fancy of Faye's to dress in white was born, partly from her Indian habits, partly from her own taste for it, but kept up in northern climates to   FAYE MAl.        79 please her father. She rarely appeared within doors in any color, at any season. During all this autumn of the year, Mrs. Ches- ter played the agreeable hostess, making every tiling in the household bend to the comfort of Major Mar and his daughter. He seemed so con- tent to be there, that Faye never told to him her first experience in that house. Even David Ches- ter comprehended not the fancy of his mother to keep them at Storm-Cliff. This woman, Mrs. Chester, needs a few words in extenuation of her life. She had never yielded her will to God or man. Sometimes, as in dealing with her son, she had taken a right angle from her given course, simply because by that means, she might conquer. In a decided combat, she was un- certain of the end; by the circuit she might reach her destination. She had never been heard to say "if you please," or c will you do me a favor?" or, "thank you," by any human ears. If gratitude to her Maker lived in her heart, man never knew of it. Mrs. Chester did not love Faye Mar, she did not even like her; and this, none knew but the child and herself. There was something in the opaline light of those beautiful eyes, that she saw in the morning sitting opposite to her at the table, that gave her a feeling of unrest, and as often as she met them during the day, they revived it, until,  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7507-00000042"/> 80        FAYE MAR. at night, she was glad to shut herself away and forget for a time that they were beneath the same roof. This keen woman knew, that just as often as Faye Mar met her son, those eyes were stealing down into his heart; but she could not-circum- stances were too strong for her-create a separa- tion there, without defeating herself. In Mrs. Chester, it was difficult to define what " herself" indicated. Love, as a sentiment, as an emotion, had never come to her, either through her husband or her children. She had mourned for them, not because she loved them, but because she wanted them to fill up the outline of her life. As Mrs. Chester, and the mistress of the white mansion called Storm-Cliff, she held a certain power and position that gave her satisfaction in that realm of her nature. As the mother and controller of the words, actions, and destinies of four fair young girls, she was a sovereign in her own right, with no one to dispute her reign; and when; one after one, those fair girls faded out of her sight, she put on the garments of mourning, and went about with a heavy heart, not because the warm love that her children might have wreathed her life in was taken from  her, but because shorn of her rights to rule over them. Only one child was left to her, and a fear entered her soul that she might not conquer him; and when this girl, English in   FAYE MAR.         81 her independent self-dependence, Indian in the grace of every motion, and with those wonderful eyes into which all the wealth of the Orient seemed poured, came in between herself and her son, Mrs. Chester's fear grew into a storm of feeling. How she kept it in control, hushing its thunders, and subduing its lightnings into courtesy, she alone knew.  Meanwhile Major Mar was beneath her roof, and day and night she studied to make it a pleasant place to him. The tranquil days of the autumn went by, and November winds swept leaves and verdure away. Major Mar began to talk, in quiet moments, to Faye, of going to a warmer climate. Mrs. Chester came upon them in one of their confidential moods, one day. They were sitting in the' library that looked out upon the sea, and were quite unconscious of her presence. Faye was threading her fingers through the beautiful white hair of her father, standing by his side, and talking gleefully to him of something in their past, that Mrs. Chester did not comprehend, when Major Mar, catching in his hand a cluster of bitter-sweet that fell from Faye's hair, exclaimed: "My pretty Tropic! I must take you where the real corals grow; these are withering, even now." "I do not care, papa; the desert, the jungle, or the valley of salt, so that you are with me-"  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7507-00000043"/> 82        FAYE MAR. "When shall we be away, Faye?" "Whenever you are quite strong. What can I do to give you strength?" u You want to go, then, Faye?" he said, look- ing up at the orient eyes beaming out their love upon him. "Papa, I am Faye Mar, D. D.; don't forget that," she said; and looking suddenly in her rear, (why, she knew not, any more than did Ailee Lee) she saw the sweep of Mrs. Chester's garments drawn silently across the angle of the door-way. Faye felt the wave of air that swept up to her from the motion, and it bent her nearer to her father. She almost whispered, with both arms tight about his neck: "ove me always, papa, better than you do anything else in this world." "My child, you are all I have to love;" and the man who had fought in many battles struggled hard to beat back the tears that gathered with the words. Major Mar was a singularly handsome man-I use the word singularly, because it is not often that a man of so few years is crowned with such a glory of hair, white as the halo of a saint. Unlike Mrs. Chester, he had governed so long, that when Faye grew up into the sweet tyranny of girlhood, he welcomed her control as one delights   FAYE MAR.         83 in the guidance of a hand at once strong and leal; her strength' was in her love, her fealty was in her Scottish name and nature. When Mrs. Chester left the room in that quiet way, unseen except by Faye Mar, the latter felt in some mysterious manner that she was losing some- thing out of her life. A half-hour passed-'Mrs. Chester had been with her son, giving him a clever little maternal lecture on his want of civility to their guests, on his seclu- sion from their society, that, in the end, made the impression on his mind that he had been, in a man- ner, deficient in his attentions. Driven into action by the words, a little while thereafter David Ches- ter joined Major Mar in the library. Faye had gone to the pearl-room, intent on some action connected with the proposed going away. Olive was there. She had joined her fortunes and her heart in the service of Miss Mar, to whom she had once been a comforter. That little lady could be stately enough  with the multitude, but with Olive her grandeur melted into kindness. She flew into the room that afternoon, and, hastily disentangling the wreath of bitter-sweet corals firom her hair, she dropped them on the carpet, and, with a merry motion of her hand, caught the comb from  Olive's hair, letting  it unroll of its own weight; then catching its end   in her hand, she  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7507-00000044"/> 84        FAYE IMAR. swung it around and around, to the confusion of the little maid, saying: "I shan't have any further use for you, we're going where there are so many of your name." "Going!" gasped Olive. "Yes, to the land of olives, and we'll take you to show how large they grow in' the North." "O Miss Mar! how you frightened me. I thought you were going away from me!" "Never, Olive! Where I go shall you go, until death, or your own will, part you from me!" Olive wiped her face on the dress she was mak- ing without even heeding it, and, from this curi- ous marriage service, the little actor walked away into the dressing-room and straight to the mirror. She looked long and steadfastly into the eyes that she saw there. She watched the mist steal over them-almost put them out; but by beat of heart and the love that was within her, she stood stead- fast, until the mist cleared, and the light shone out bright and clear as the noonday. Then she emerged from the inner place, saying: "Olive, I do not think my father has intimated his going to Mrs. or Mr. Chester; say nothing re- garding it, until I give you leave." She went down to the-library, skipping into the room like a bird, and, finding her father alone, she perched upon his knee, and began to warble a   FAYE MAR.         85 little low song, made up of lark and nightingale, in such quaint proportion of trill and semibreve and demisemiquaver, that Major Mar suddenly turned upward the little chin, and, the song ceas- ing, he looked into her eyes, asking: "What ails you, darling?" She held .them firm, and answered: "Can't I sing out my love for you, without get- ting choked to death?" He, laughing, let her go, just as Mrs. Chester entered the room, followed by her son. It' was near November's close. Yellow crisps floated hither and thither across the usually well- kept lawns, like ghosts of leaves, doomed to wander under the skeletons they once had clothed. "We soon shall have snows about us; how I dread their coming!" said Mrs. Chester, crossing the room, and looking into the grate, as if to see that it was well cared for; then, no one replying, she walked to the eastern window, near which Major Mar was sitting, Faye on a foot-cushion at his side.  Dovn Cliff-lane, and away ocean-ward her eyes wandered, then came back to Faye. "You ought to be out this clear afternoon," she said. "Don't you   see, Major Mar, that since our cold airs forbid your walks, this child is getting pale. Her bloom seems to have a blight coming over it; she ought to be out in this fine air." , 4 :  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7507-00000045"/> 86        FAYE MAR. "You are right, Ilrs. Chester. Come, Faye, we will go." "No, papa, you are not able." ' But you will not go without me; therefore I must." "Yes, I will," said the daughter, with a surge of unthankfulness toward 1Mrs. Chester, for having proposed anything so disagreeable. "Permit Mr. Chester to accompany you, pray do!"'solicited Mrs. Chester; adding, "Our beach is frequented by sportsmen at this time of the year. I really do not think it quite prudent, Major Miar, for your daughter to go alone." David Chester had arisen. Mrs. Chester had cunningly devised her plan. There was no escape for the two souls from this walk on the shore; and she who had forged the last link, looked quietly  out upon the two as they went their way down to the great sea, without a quiver in her heart at the deed she had done. But her work lay before her -she turned to it at the moment Major Mar lost sight of his child, for she had narrowly watched him as he gazed upon her. "Don't you think that she is drooping, that she needs change?" she asked. '"I had not thought of it in that light, Mrs. Chester, but perhaps it is so; my illness has made me selfish. I have lingered here too long under   FAYE MAR.         87 your hospitable roof, thinking only of my own comfort. We had a talk of going, Faye and I, this afternoon."     e       "Pray do not look upon my words in that light; it was not that I meant-my son's house is always open to our friends, so long as they will stay. The words I spoke, were entirely for your child's benefit. The change I meant was more freedom from nin-door life. You know, Major Mar, that the chimney-corner period, does not come at nineteen." ' But what can I do? - I can not go up and down, hither and thither as I used, and Faye will not leave me." ' That is because she thinks herself essential to your happiness; it is one of the vanities of youth." C"She is essential to my happiness; it is not vanity in her to think so." " Can you not make her less so?" "How?" There was a silence in the room for a moment, then Mrs. Chester spoke. c. Major Mar, I am moved to speak to you in be- half of a motherless child, who is growing up to womanhood with one idea in her mind. She has revolved about you so long, that other influences fall -powerless to move her, You ought to have  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7507-00000046"/> 88        FAYE MAR. witnessed the demonstration she made when we thought you lost, even to going down in the dead of the night to the shore with my son. What should I have done if one of my daughters had been so willful? but they are gone, and I am alone." For a moment, a sort of film came up from the woman's heart, but her next words tore it into fragments. "You ought to arouse your- self from selfishness, and learn to live less for her and in her!" "Tell me how it is to be accomplished, and, it it is for her good, I will do it." "Learn to live for some one else." "Some one else!" echoed Major Mar; his face growing deadly white, his pulses standing still. "In that way and that alone it will be proven that she is not essential to your happiness. Sup- pose that you should be taken away from her. Think! with no other object in life, how miserable, how desolate she would be. I tremble when I look at her to think how much she needs a wise wo- man's counsel. Ask yourself if it is not true?" "You, who call yourselves Christians, believe, or profess to believe, that God does all things for the best; can you tell me, then, why, if it is not best that Faye should be without a mother, he took her from her child?" "The ways of Providence are beyond our   F'AYE MAR.        89 fathoming, but our religion provides for such dis- pensations by permitting-second marriages." "Pardon me, madam, I believe the air of this room is chill," said this poor gentleman, ignobly attacked through the two vital points of his nature. Major Mar left the room. Mrs. Chester put her feet upon the fender and dreamed the twilight away, certain, that however imperfect the present settings, her work had been skillfully carved. The fires on Storm-Cliff that night blazed with unwonted splendor; spicy odors floated through the rooms-how contrived, none knew so well as Mrs. Chester, until the next morning the owner of the conservatory walked through it and wit- nessed the spoliation there. The November twilight came and   faded before David Chester and Faye Mar came up from the sea. They had been on Storm-Cliff and watched the sun go down, far away to the westward behind that range; of mountains of which the cliff was the last land-height. Faye Mar had told of their going, but David Chester, true to his Chester honor, had not, nor would he, while Major Mar and his daughter were guests beneath his roof, speak words, that under any circumstances might make them uncomfortable in remaining. The "hunter's moon "   shone brightly over our  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7507-00000047"/> 90        FAYE MAR. dear old earth when the two came back from their walk. Tea was waiting, and Faye rose i up to summon her father. That gentleman was lying upon a lounge close drawn to the fire, and, at the moment Faye went in, his face was hidden in the pillows. She went up to him, kneeled down and began to caress him in her old, loving way, when he put out his arm gently, very gently, putting her from him, saying, "Don't, child! learn to be more wo- manly." Major Mar had sent the first arrow into the heart that he would rather have died for, than that it should suffer through him. Surely Mrs. Chester had wrought well. Faye arose-a strange, unearthly sensation creeping through her frame-and said, "Mrs. Chester requested me to tell you that tea was on the table," and, for propriety's sake, went to smooth the wind-tangles from her hair. For the first time in Faye Mar's life another person than her father took the last place in her conscious thoughts that night. Her thought was, "Could Mr. Chester have meant what he said to me on the cliff that night?" The midnight looked in through the wtindows, and found Major Mar wandering to and fro with a wild, restless feeling flooding his nature. He was   FAYE MAR.         91 inwardly chafing at the thoughts the stately wo- man of Cliff House had called into his mind; he was fee1in, the stones that were already set into the wall, which was to grow between his child and himself; scarcely knowing how they had been put into place. A curve of satisfaction in Mrs. Chester's lip, was the only sign she gave that that day's work had wrought more than any other. Thus, that November night went by, not one of the troubled souls there knowing that that which they sought was not to be found in the places where they delved to search for treasure. Notwithstanding Mrs. Chester's glowing fires and spicy odors, Major Mar decided to go from Storm-Cliff, but, in the few days that remained before their departure, she so managed her house- hold that Faye should be abroad as much as possi- ble.  Her plans were so skillfully laid that the child did, not discover that every afternoon her father was left alone with Mrs. Chester, and he, a martyr to his new   line of duty, t7lougfit he was enduring those things for the sake of Faye, and tried to be content. The final day of remaining came, and over the lunch-table  Mrs. Chester spoke with  sudden animation to Faye, saying, Have you forgotten, child, that you ought to ride down to-the village,  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7507-00000048"/> 92        FAYE MAR. and take leave of poor Martha Sing? I am afraid she will feel that you forget her unless you go. David, will you attend to the matter for Miss Mar?" "I think I will make a grand effort and go down there," said Major Mar. "I intended to do so before leaving." Mr. Chester signified his intention to accom- pany them, and the question was decided so until within ten minutes of the appointment, when Mrs. Chester joined Major Mar, waiting, hat in hand, for the carriage. "I thought," she said, "you had taken my advice, and intended to make all the necessary sacrifices. Faye is just getting used to your absence in her little excursions; besides, I do not think you are quite equal to the drive." She said this with the air and manner of one grieved that her best efforts had been unappre- ciated. Faye at the moment came down the staircase, radiant with the thought of a drive with her father. She had so missed his presence of late, and since that, to her, terrible putting away of caresses, she had been timid and shy in her demon- -strations, that she might be in no danger of a second repulse. "I have just been saying to your father, Miss   FAYE MAR.         93 Mar, that I do not think he is able to drive so far. You know our November afternoons are so short, it will be late when you return." "Then we will not go. You will be so kind as to say our farewells for us," said Faye. "Never mind, child! You can go without me." "But, papa, I don't wish to go; I choose to stay." "Really, Miss Mar, permit me to advise you; I am certain that with your kind heart you would not offend such poor persons as the men who saved your father to you." "Papa, am I to go?" asked Faye, not replying to Mrs. Chester's words. ' It will please me, Faye." a; Then good-by, papa; don't get too lonely," said the child, going up to the gentleman, who stood longingly there, perplexed between ilaclina- tion and duty. What had come to Major Mar that he only half returned the parting kiss of his child? Faye felt it. Even the soft Indian summer air that came in upon the land, as the tide sweeps in from windless seas, could not dispel the strange vacancy in her heart. David Chester was silent. He was waiting for his usually bright companion to talk, but they were half-way to the village before Faye said one  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7507-00000049"/> "        FAYE MAR. word. Then she startled him by uttering these words: "Do you remember, BIr. Chester, that night down on Storm-Cliff, whan I believed my father drowned, I told you that I promised God that I would be content if only he would let his body float on shore-if he would give that much back to me; and I believe my promise must be kept. I sometimes think, lately, that 'tis only his body that has come, he is so changed, and yet, you know, I promised to be content-how can I?" There was something in this appeal that went down into the depths of David Chester's being. He was not a religious man, he was only strictly honorable, because he perceived the beauty and the peace of such a course of life.; because, from his infancy his father had instilled into his mind that ,uch a course must be pursued by all the Chester race. Hence this appeal to him opened up the truth of his own deficiency. He did not reply, until they came out of the cedars that lined the road. Then he said: "Miss Mar, on that same night on Storm-Cliff I said words to you, believing you to be alone in the world. When your father came back, I wished them unspoken for your sake and for his. Now, on the eve of your departure, I repeat the words." Poor little Faye Mar scarce more than a child   FAYE MAR.         95 in everything except the development of affection for her father that was become her true life, -and, with the arrows -fast in her heart that the hand she had so treasured sent, she felt this new love stealing over her nature like a dew that Heaven sends down to soften and refresh the flowers that have drooped beneath burning sun; felt it without any recognition of the Giver. Robert Sing and his wife were the recipients of gifts that day, quietly bestowed by Faye Mar within their cabin, that changed the current of their lives. Martha Sing went to church, soon after that time, in a new shawl, like unto which no fisherman's wife in all the village had aspired. No longer, when winds blew and waves rolled, need the aged man go forth in search of his daily bread. What had been   labor, became a recreation. Neither was "Man Isaac" forgotten. Major Mar had intended his gifts to follow his departure, but Mrs. Chester's words changed many plans of his. One of them found a new direction in this manner. Not the slightest suspicion of the real intent of Mrs. Chester, when she seated herself for a social talk with Major Mar that afternoon, entered his mind. This man had known but few women, and no one of them had been of the type of this one, who drew her easy chair near his lounge, and began, by saying:  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7507-00000050"/> 96        FAYE MAR. "Major Mar, since the time that you are to remain our guest is now so brief, and I can do so without giving offense, there are a few things which I deem it my duty to say. I feel the com- pliment to my judgment in your' giving up the drive this afternoon and in your sending Faye so often to the shore of late; perhaps it is this defer- ence that emboldens me to say that your daughter needs the daily, hourly influence of a wise woman. How is she to be fitted for her position as a wife, without it?" Major Mar started up at these words, the per- spiration standing out full upon his face-if possi- ble, his hair must have whitened yet more. "Mrs. Chester, you are making my Faye an- other being; pray cease." "Now is my time," thought the woman, c" in this state I can work out my plan." "Sit down, my friend, pray do not excite your- self so, or I must forever leave these things unsaid, which, as the mother of daughters, I feel it my duty to say, which your will, one day, thank me for having said." Major Mar conquered himself, still for the sake of his child. "If it will benefit her," he gasped, resuming his place. "I perceive that the idea of your child as a wife, shocks your feelings as a father;-then tell   FAYE MAR.         97 me what it would be to that child to find that a husband was less indulgent than her father; and can you, for a moment, imagine that any man would permit her to work out her own will and whims as you do?" "Perhaps, if that awful day should come, she will be less willful, have fewer whims, be less ex- pectant." "That is just the danger. You men, who can not understand the nature of a young girl, do not know how to train it to wise purposes. You be- lieve that there is nothing to do but to present a circumstance, and that a woman will rise to it, while we know how difficult it is, even under severe discipline, to fit a woman to bear the whims of a man serenely." "Very well, madam, admitting all that you say to be the very spirit of truth, what am I to do with my sprite? Shall I immure her in a con- vent, until her wings are worn away with beating against iron bars and stony hearts. Will that fit her for this world?" "There are influences outside of convents, that might be powerful for good; a young lady, like Miss Mar, needs a mother's influence-a woman, who has daughters of her own, knows how to guide her. Even now, youi propose to take her forth from this qui'et retreat --your own health impaired, -- 5             &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7507-00000051"/> 98        FAYE MAR. less fitted than ever before to make common in- terest out of the hours. And what is she to do- to pine away in seclusion with you, or to be thrown into whatever society may be at her conm- mand? I put it to your common-sense as a man, is it a fair ordeal for Faye? "Again I ask, what is the remedy?" "Could you not secure for her as a companion, some person whose character she could model her own upon?" "What, and be forever troubled by the pres- ence of a third party? I think that would kill both Faye and me." "There is but one alternative-a second mar- riage." "Which is utterly repugnant to me; I am con- tent with my child." "C You forget that the time may come when she will leave you?" The conversation was at that point arrested by visitors. The visitors had not left when Mr. Ches- ter and Miss Mar returned. C I am so glad we are going to-morrow, papa,' said Faye, creeping up to him in the gloaming, and glancing around with a half-frightened gesture, lest there was some one within hearing; " it will be so nice to have you all my own again." "Whose am I, Faye, but yours?" \   PAYE 5MAR.         99 i I do not know, but it seems as if you were not altogether the same that you were, before we came here." "And you, Faye, how is it with you?" She hid her face on her father's shoulder, and was not rebuked for so doing. Everything was made ready for departure on the morning following.  Miss Mar could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of unrest, to which her nature was unaccustomed in its perfect health, made rest impossible. At midnight, she sat look- ing forth upon the starry sky, wondering at life and her own sadness in leaving Storm-Cliff. In the clear silence, there came along the hall sounds of feet moving with caution, lest sleepers should be awakened. As she listened, they died away, and a faint, low knock upon a door, in a distant part of the house, fell like a weight upon her ears. What could it indicate? Ere she had time to speculate there came whispered voices, speaking at her very door. "Mother," she heard, "we    must; it is but right." "She would only make him worse by her pres- ence." The whisperers passed by. "They meant me," thought Faye; "it is my father perhaps," and, without an instant's hesitation, she opened the  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7507-00000052"/> 100       :VAYE MAR. door into the hall. The darkness was so deep that it was necessary to return and light a lamp. She was gliding along to her father's room, lamp in hand, when just before she reached it, Mrs. Chester appeared, as if issuing from her own apartments. "Tell me, please, was it you I heard whisper- ing in the hall?" she urged; "tell me what has happened; let me go!" she ejaculated as that lady laid a detaining hand upon her. "Indeed, you must not, your' father has a sudden ill-attack, that, if left to quietness, may pass off. My son is with him; it is better for you to go back to your room." "Mrs. Chester, let me pass; I am under your roof, but so long as my father is under it, I can not be kept from him." The little figure seemed to rise and expand under the indignation it felt. The lamp she held, paled before the light from her eyes. The two, the woman and the child, confronted each other. In that moment Mrs. Chester's will would have withered Faye Mar like a scroll, and cast her from her, she so hated the little mass of illuminated flesh that stood before her. The motion with which the woman bent and blew the flame from the girl's lamp, must have been of marvelous quickness; she could no longer   FAYE MAR.        101 endure the opal light from the eyes before her. Suddenly she grasped Faye by the arm, put her out of the way, and, in the perfect darkness of the hall, the two groped. It was Faye who first reached her father's apartments. Regardless of ceremony, she rushed in, eager and breathless, her unbraided hair hanging about her like a mantle. "Don't, child," whispered David Chester, "he will be better soon." The words were spoken by one prophesying falsely, but kindly. He did not forbid the daugh- ter to offer her gentle ministrations to one who could not ask them. Mrs. Chester had done her work thoroughly, but the. end was not what she sought. Know- - ing nothing of love for husband or child, she had not calculated with precision its force over the heart of Major Mar.   He had fought with it, and his mind remaining firm, nature, as- serting its right, came in the visible form of paralysis. "What. is it?"' gasped Faye; "what is the matter?" With the truth that was in him, David Chester spoke out and told her. How well he comprehended that knowledge would bring strength. She thanked him with  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7507-00000053"/> 102        FAYE MAR. such gratitude, that, even in that hour, its sweet- ness gave him courage. "Mr. Chester." she whispered, " promise me one thing-is this your house?" "Yes." "Then promise me that no one shall prevent my staying with my father, in it." "I promise." The child, who so needed woman's counsel and society, went about in those sacred rooms, made so by that dear, helpless presence, from that moment, without word of remonstrance from any source. Lying upon the toilet table, Faye Mar found a note, addressed to her father. Not knowing the writer thereof, after having kept it a day or two, hoping for an improved condition in the patient, she stole away, and opened it. Foiled in all her plans, the stately woman of Storm-Cliff had taken revenge upon the " bit of flesh " that stood in her way. Faye quivered, as she read the words there written. Quickly, as if it had been a serpent, she cast the note into the grate, then clasped her hands together in thankfulness that the seal had been unbroken.  It was not that letter, it was not those words, that had caused the illness. To and fro through the rooms wandered and searched Mrs. Chester for the note that lay, a curled,   FAYE MAR.         103 shriveled scroll, sinking into ashes, in Faye Mar's presence. This woman was left to all the torture of be- lieving that her own hand had penned the words, that laid.

HAD any one been through Storm-Cliff during the hours given to sleep, for a number of nights previous to the proposed departure of Major Mar, Mrs. Chester might have been met, going, in softly slippered feet, to and fro from her own rooms to one that had long been unused. When suddenly called, in the night, to attend Major Mar, she was busy packing trunks, yet she had made no mention of a journey to be taken. The trunks disappeared as quietly as .they had been conveyed thither, the contents were dispersed to their accustomed places, and all went on in the dwelling as before, except that Major Mar came not to the places of family-meeting, and Faye made her visits there as brief as possible. 'The snows fell around Storm-Cliff, and the winter gales grew into all the majesty of winter storms; but into the quiet room. little of winter or of storm had entrance, when Major Mar slowly came back to the world.   FAYE MAR.         105 To his daughter, time went wearily, and before "Christmas greens" were gathered, she had faded to a pale, delicate shadow of her once rosy self. In vain Mrs. Chester advised and entreated her to leave her father for a short time, but Faye's invariable answer was, "I might not find him here when I return, and he would miss me."] So she kept to -her mission, until, one day, with a burning pain in her head, she sought Mrs. Ches- ter, saying, "I can not sit in my father's room just now; he tries to tell me what he wants, and I can not see." The child could not see, or she would have dis- covered the curves of satisfaction that came into Mrs. Chester's face as she said, in reply, "I have seen for a long time that you were over-exerting yourself, but you would not be advised; go now and rest, I will remain with Major Mar until you are better." That night, when the physician in attendance came, he was conducted to Miss Mar's room, and Mrs. Chester, with avidity, attended to the prescriptions and the treatment. Indeed, so careful was she to give the medicines herself, that Olive more than suspected that the doses given were measured- out in larger quantity than the doctor ordered. In those weeks of illness that came to Faye Mar, Mrs. Chester carried out her plans without any  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7507-00000055"/> 106        FAYE MAR. molestation. With consummate art, she made herself essential to Major Mar, adapting herself to his weakness and his helplessness as only such a woman could have done, gliding into his invalid estate with a remedy for every ill, or an allevia- tion as potent as human art could make it. When Miss Mar returned to her father's apartments, she found no place for her feeble offerings of assistance, in the presence of the calm, strong woman, who had usurped her place. For the first time since her school life, that night Faye let sleep overtake her with tears in her eyes. The sobs of the child, for child she still was, penetrated to the hall. Mrs. Chester heard them in her going to and firo before the house grew quiet for the night, an(d a feeling of exulta- tion moved her nature, as she thought of the eyes that had so shone in their certainty of never being eclipsed. If the stately woman of Storim-Cliff had ever known an emotion of love toward a human being, it might have sanctified her heart to sympathy with the weeping Faye; but, with the graceful sweep of her garments trailing past the pearl-room, she went and came, listening for the sobs that told of her own victory. Circumstances had wrought well for Mrs. Ches- ter. She had trusted to that note for an intima-   FAYE MAR.        107 tion that her presence would greatly benefit Faye during a winter in the West Indies. The note had never been opened by him for whom it was intended. But that last work of her's was one of supererogation. The channel she had been steadily deepening duringc the days of autumn filled with- out the great storm of her preparation, and the hand that lays so many low, pinioned him, as she could never have done. David Chester did not, for a moment, suspect the drama that was enacting under his white walls; how could he, with his Chester honor undimmed?  He was not to be informed by Faye. Of his mother, to him her lips were sealed, because she was his mother. "Nothing annoying must be permitted in Major Mar's room," the doctor had said, and repeated so often, that every word was twice studied before spoken there; hence Faye never went to him except with pleasant words and smiles that, had he been well, would have never passed for smiles. In the early spring, when the March winds began to trace their grand orbits around the earth, Major Mar mended. When April showers had fallen, he was strong enough to take short walks up and down the wide verandas; and, when- June burst over the earth with perfection of foliage, he had twice been driven to the beach. Day by day, during this time, Faye saw that the powers she had so long excited for  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7507-00000056"/> 108        FAYE MAR. her father's happiness were no longer powerful to please. Mrs. Chester had taken upon herself more than half the duties that once were Faye's. The physician advised change, a journey to the north- ward, little delays among the mountains, and frequent drives in new places. No one seemed to comprehend precisely where the plan origin- ated, but it was arranged that Mrs. Chester should be of the party, and that Mr. Chester should join them, among the mountains, a month later. David Chester met them at a little village in Vermont. The woman, over whom nearly half a century had rolled, had, during this month, over- come the girl of nineteen, so that when Mr. Ches- ter reached S  , there was no visible improve- ment in Faye, notwithstanding everything in nature had. been tried to the utmost. The con- stant effort to avoid exciting topics, preyed like a secret care upon the dutiful child, and she rarely met her father, morning, noon, or night, without a whispered warning from Mrs. Chester, hanging like a pall over the meeting, so that the blithesome, happy, careless spirit was toned down to a few dull topics, that wearied her so, that sometimes she was glad to get away by herself, where, at least, she could think her own thoughts without a dictator. One evening Faye had been out for a ride with   FAYE MAR.        109 a party of persons, whose antecedents having all been carefully considered (as far as known) by Mrs. Chester, had been pronounced suitable ac-. quaintance. At the entrance of the hotel, whelre they were awaiting Mr. Chester, Faye met his mother. She was wrapped for an evening walk. "Go, my child," said that lady, with the blandest accents that ever had fallen from her lips for Faye, "to your father, as soon as you have laid aside your habit; he has something important to say to you." A request from her father was too rare now to be disregarded, and Faye, careless of her riding- dress, with the old opal gleaming in her eyes, only half concealed by the drooping of her hat, was hastening along the hall to her father's rooms, when she felt a touch on her shoulder. It was Mrs. Chester, who had returned.   "Whatever may be said, or told you, remember one thing, if your father is troubled or crossed in any thing, it may bring on a second attack." "Do not fear, Mrs. Chester, I never ' crossed,' as you say, my father, in my life." "Remember! be on your guard"-and Mrs. Chester went out. Major Mar was sitting in an easy chair drawn close to the open window, from which could be seen a river valley and the heights that men call Green Mountains. Faye stole in upon him like a 5'::  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7507-00000057"/> "O       FAYE MAR. vision of beauty, her lovely golden hair let loose by 'the mountain winds, and brilliant in the setting sun, as if it had just been powdered with the sands of Ophir. Her soul had been uplifted that day by a talk with a good, true little lady, who had coIme to the mountains out of deep afflictions at home, and who was striving to use them as God's best means to confirm her faith and strength. The mental beauty of this lady's words had alone been* breathed upon Faye, but even that caused Major Iar, as he looked upon her, to say, "What has come to you, my child, how much better you are looking,!" "Am I, papa?  I am so glad, for then you will let me do something for you; tell me, please, what I can do to make you happy." "Not much, I fear, my darling! Such youth and health as yours ought to be, should not have much in common with an old man whose hair is white, and the better part of whose life is gone." "Papa, I can not let you talk in that way. You are not old, and your hair has been white almost ever since I can remember. You would not be half so fine to me if you were a brown- haired young man," and Faye resumed her old habit of threading her fingers in his hair. "Papa, you have something to tell me, what is it?" she suddenly asked,   FAYE MAR.        1" He hesitated a moment, and then with that eager movement of one anxious to get past a battle and be at rest, he said, "Faye, I am getting old; I may die and leave you; I have resolved that you shall not be left alone, among strangers." "O papa! are you going home?" she cried, ex- cited beyond her power of control, at the thought. "Not immediately, Faye; I am  going to be married." A look of keenest pain passed over Major Mar's face as he glanced at his child. She was sitting close beside him, the last rays of the going sun gilding the parting of her hair, her eyes hidden from his sight by the drooping lids; but when she heard the words - to be married," she looked up full in his face. "Papa, to whom?" "Don't be alarmed, child, or think I would bring into that sacred relation one a stranger to you l. "Who is it, papa?" "Have you no thought, Faye; can you not tell?" "No, sir; how could I? I did not know vou knew any one here, except Mrs. Chester." "It is she, Faye." "Papa, what have you done?" and Faye threw her arms around her father's neck, "tell me that you do not mean it."  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7507-00000058"/> "2       FAYE MAR. "Not mean it, child, and are you not thankful? I thought it would make you so happy." At that moment a hurried knock at the door resulted in the incoming of David Chester. Fresh from Storm-Cliff, he knew nothing of the changes that had taken place. Faye arose from her posi- tion when the knock came. Seeing who entered, she advanced to greet him, all her brightness van- ished, and, with a face as blanched as a daisy's, she quietly passed out from the open door, and Olive found her an hour later, still in her riding- dress, and with the old look that she had worn during the day and night when she believed her father dead. "O Miss Faye! we've been looking all the place over for you. Nobody thought you were here, and Mrs. Chester is in such a way about you." "Tell them, Olive, that I am wearied with my ride, and will not go down to-night. Olive," she called after the maid, " will you tell Major Mar good-night for me, and I shall not need you any more." Olive returned with a message from Major Alar, in response to that of his daughter, and then was dismissed'for the night. Faye sat at the window until the night grew dim with the great shadows of the mountains that walled in the little village of S . There came to her sounds of happy voices from the rooms below, and every   FAYE 3IAR.         113 voice touched her heart to utter, "There is no more joy in life for me." Faye studied what she ought to do. Under the circumstances, she seemed powerless. She could not go to David Chester with words of his mother; she could not peril the precious. life of her father, by telling him   her horror of his proposed marriage, and even the note that had long been consumed, that was lost. "If only papa were well!" she said to herself in: the darkness, "'if only he were himself, this thing could not be;" and again she thought of her prom- ise-prayer on Storm-Cliff, and its answer in the poor wreck of her former father, to whom she still clung with all the fealty of her nature. That night Faye Mar passed she knew not how. It was in one long, fierce struggle with herself, in making choice between her father and Mrs. Ches- ter, or utter separation from him. Faye's nine- teen years had not given her wisdom    enough to solve the question, and daylight came, finding her still in  doubt. A  little white flutter of paper carme in under the door, as if put there by some mysterious agency. Faye flew softly to it. These words were there written: "MY DARLING D.

But, how dare she? she does not care for him. If I could only tell him! if only he were himself!" At the breakfast hour no one would have deemed that the young lady arrayed in white, and with a wealth of soft golden curls floating about her face, who appeared before Major M]ar, had been all night tortured with doubt as to her future course in life. She had put on (it was Faye's first de- ception) her brightest air, and she met her father with inquiries for his condition, that quite dis- armed the power of the little lecture he had men- tally prepared for her. "I was sorry you had a headache last night, Faye. Are you better this morning?" "Yes, papa, thank you, I am quite well." "Do you not think, Faye, that it will be better for us all to have this change made soon? I wish to consult your wishes on the subject." "Please do not, papa; consult only your own happiness, whatever will really and truly make you happier, I can content myself with; but, father, do not make the mistake of thinking you are to do this thing for my sake. I am selfish, and prefer you all to myself, therefore my judg- ment should not be relied upon. Please forget me, I only wish to see you happy."   FAYE MAR.        l15 "And I to see you happy, my D.

"What a handsome man, what a lovely young lady!" was the opinion of all who saw the father and daughter enter the breakfast-room that morn- ing. There was nothing to tell that either had passed a wakeful night. Only a shade paler grew Faye's face when Mrs. Chester made her appearance in the room, accom- panied by her son. She went through the form of salutation, and immediately the plans for the day began to be discussed all about them. It was an- nounced that the nose of the mountain could be distinctly seen, by one who had been on the look- out since sunrise, and every promise of a fine view was given after breakfast, for the rifts of cloud, 'that so love Mount Mansfield, had gone on an ex- cursion elsewhere. Mrs. Chester, as was her wont to do, changed her plan of going at the last moment, even after the mountain-wagon had received its quota of passengers. She declared that she had every symptom of headache, and was  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7507-00000060"/> "6       FPAYE MAR. certain that the pleasure of the party would only be spoiled by getting her half-way up the moun- tain and being obliged to return with her. It was quite natural that Mrs. Chester's head should ache under all the burden of its planning, but she had a motive for staying home. She knew not, as yet, the effect of the communication Major Mar had made to his daughter; besides, this woman feared to leave Major Mar too long to his own thoughts. She had not intended to go. Mrs. Chester waved her farewell from the steps, with something as nearly a smile as her features could form, gliding over them; but, as the wagon disappeared around a curve, her face changed to iron firmness, and, below the measure of her daily voice, she murmured, "Yozr time has almost come! you girl, with the shining eyes and yellow hair, shall not foil me much longer. When once I have the power--" And yet, what had Faye Mar ever done to make Mrs. Chester hate her so? She had only shown a will of her own, and that will, the woman, who had always been obeyed by her own flesh and blood, intended to subdue. It was' this woman who was urging upon Major Mar the necessity for an early marriage; that, once achieved, she might separate -her son from his daughter.   FAYE . MAR.        117 CHAPTER VII. BESIDE A CAIRN ON A MOUNTAIN TOP. The sweet influences that float around God's mountains fell refreshingly upon Faye's spirits as they wound along the road leading up to Mt. Mansfield. David Chester watched the changes that went and came upon her face, not knowing how to interpret them. In that last drive at Storm-Cliff, when he had repeated the words once spoken, she had said that "Nothing could sepa- rate her from her father," but now, although she spoke only of the beauty of the hill-sides and the lofty mountain, to which they were every moment drawing near, yet in the accents of her voice there were clinging tones, that told of conscious weak- ness recognizing his strength. These two souls had not spoken together since Mr. Chester's ar- rival. No opportunity came until they had left the wagon at the half-way house. It was a vicious looking-little horse the guide brought forward for the lady, (it is older now, and on the mountain yet) and its' name is "Paddy, Junior."

' Paddy" had made so many journeys to the sum- mit that he had learned the view "all by heart," and a melancholy view it was, to him. Brought up to the place for mounting, he shied, as if afraid of it, and then started off to crop a bit of fern or a twig or two of the mountain raspberry. The guide was as amiable as guide could be expected to be under the circumstances, and the horse was per- mitted to eat, until the remainder of the party had fallen into the bridle-path. "Miss Iar," said Mr. Chester, (they two standing alone on the little rude platform, while the guide was pursuing Paddy among the brambles) ' why are you so sad to- day?" Faye started suddenly, replying: "I thought I was doing my utmost to seem happy to-day, this day of all others. I have so longed to go up the mountain. I believe I am not sad." "You will pardon me for saying that I have never seen you with so little of happiness in your face." Poor little Miss Mar, looking more the child than ever, in her mountain dress, which she made a feint of arranging, and, under cover of lwhich, she contrived to control the tears that were surg- ing up, at the call of sympathy. But "Paddy, Junior" had consented to be caught, and with one or two furtive jumps aside,   FAYE MAR.        119 at the moment when Miss Mar would have mounted, he ended his antics for that time, and soon the guide passed, on his hurrying way, to learn that all was going well above. Shut in by trees of long growth, covered with mosses grim and mosses green, up the rugged way, climbing rocks and fallen trees, they went, Faye now and then turning, with a fleck or two of sunlight get- ting down the gloom and settling on her hair, to see if Mr. Chester was safe behind. This turning to look, at first a matter of caution on her part, became, as they went on, more frequent. On all the mountain, it seemed to Faye, there were none, but they two. A hoarse cry from  the guide to some half-starved pony, who had discovered a leaf of fern, came floating down now and then, like a note in discord with the anthems singing in the old pine trees far above. Ever, as she looked, there was the same figure, so erect, ip its conscious strength, the same clear, brown eyes that never turned aside from meeting her own; and she felt, in some way, as if that journey up. the mountain were'to last all the way through life, the same guardian spirit following her steps, until, at the last, they should reach-where? Faye was think- ing of the. end of all journeys with a dull, dim dread, they seemed so unsatisfactory, when a glee- some shout up the height told that some view had  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7507-00000062"/> 120        FAYE MAR. been reached. In silence they came to it: it is where the green sides that one has climbed come into sight, lying in a hollow that irresistably brings to mind the Hand in whose hollow the mountains are held. It lies before you, so winning, so bright, so beautiful, that you are conscious of but one longing, to throw yourself down into and find per- fect rest. Faye let fall her bridle, clasped her hands together, and looked long into the valley, then at Mr. Chester, who had ridden close. He withdrew his eyes from the view, to meet hers. "Is it there, we can find it, Mr. Chester?" "I can find many things in it; for what were you seeking?" "Only for rest: for a place where things are fixed." u That is not here: winter comes; the green withers." "I know. If one could only get to a place where new things never come!"Faye said this, with a quiver in her voice, that was lost an instant later in entreaties to "Paddy, Junior " to go on his way. There was no further attempt at words until they came out upon the summit of Mansfield. The little party were dismounting, one by one, and all too busy with their personal safety to think of the view, all but the last two. Miss Mar's spirit arose into a transport of silent delight, *   FAYE MAR.        121 as she sat awaiting her turn to dismount. Nature herself was in a state of bliss around Mansfield that day. Silent and still was the lone mountain- top, the very winds had drawn off; voice of man seemed almost a sacrilegious sound. "O Mr. Chester!" whispered Miss- Mar, as he lifted her from "Paddy, Junior," "I think it is here." He smiled, looking down upon her, and wonder- ing in his heart what manner of woman she would be a score of years to come. They went to the eastern side of the little house that then gave shelter to mountain lovers. Broad and calm and holy lay the land down far, far be- low the slopes of green. Little villages blossomed over the fair garden, watered by many streams. And then, when the eyes tired and looked their utmost to find something on which to rest, there lay, sublimely reposing, like a  sarcophagus of time, Mount Washington. How many    eons have been consumed within -its granite heart, God and the angels who keep the records alone can -tell. Faye was speechless before the scene; and when a veritable earthly bell announced an earthly dinner, she went in-doors with a wistful, dreaming look,  that even mountain hunger could not dispel. Less than a  century ago, Ivory Luce went to dwell under the shadow of Mount Mansfield, buy- 6  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7507-00000063"/> 122        tAYE MAt. ing a farm out of its most earthward slopes. This man, whether from whim or fear I know not, gave to the elevations and depressions of the mountain- top the features, not of a human face--please re- member, ye who try to find them--but the Devil's. The Devil's "Nose " and "Lips" and "Chin" are now known without the individual proprietor's name appended. It may be that the Spirit of Evil has made them over to nature, who holds them under the title of Nose, Lips, and Chin. After dinner, it was planned "to go up the Nose," the ascent being made by clinging to a rope made fast in the rock. The side of " the Nose " has the appearance of having been in some far- away period of time a mound of sand, down which the tide had ebbed once and forever, and in the long ages the sand had changed to rock. So com- plete is the illusion that the sea has just ebbed from thence, that one half expects, in climbing, to meet a sideward-creeping crab, or rift of rock- weed. Brilliant and breathless from the long ascent, Miss Mar stood, hat in hand, (she had taken it off in involuntary reverence for the place) her golden hair wreathed like a halo around her little head, the deep opal gleam in her eyes, and her whole spirit shining through eyes and face, until it chanced that, as she stood thus with her out-look   :FAYE M-A. A123 far away toward the White Hills, the party who had made the ascent, one by one, withdrew their sight from the distant glory to the near vision of loveliness. Suddenly Faye came back from the White Hills, so suddenly, that she caught a glimpse of the little crowd looking at her. Quickly she put her hand within Mr. Chester's arm, and they walked on to the brow. "Tell me, Mr. Chester, what have I been doing, that they should all look at me so?" "Nothing, Miss Mar; I was looking at you also, and, I assure you, nothing." "How could you, with such a magnificent view? Don't you think these mountains ought to teach us wonderful things? God meant them for won- ders, I think. I am trying to use this day for a good purpose." ' That is well; so would I. You shall teach me, if you will, what it is." "No, I will try -and bear it all alone, to-day. Have you learned any thing very particular since you came?" "No; how could I? I've not had time for any secrets. yet. Have you one for me?" ' I have one that concerns both you arid me." "Then you will not keep me from my share in it. We must go on; we've scarcely time to go to 'the Chin,' and I am told the northern view is the finest."  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7507-00000064"/> 124        TAYiE MAR. "I will think of it on the way thither, and, un- less I repent, will tell you." -." It is a long, weary way, over rocks, and slip- pery with wet mosses-no time for thought or re- pentance, so I am quite certain of learning my fate. Come!" and he held out his hand; "Never be certain of any thing, not even of what you grasp, Mr. Chester. I was certain of one thing, and it has failed me. What an ugly conceit to call this magnificent ' sky-cliff' a nose. What if it should sneeze as we are going down! Wouldn't it be charming to find it, some morning after an equinoctial gale, transported like 'Lo- retto's chapel,' and standing over against Storm- Cliff?" "How grave and gay you are to-day, Miss Mar. One thing you may be certain of; the solidity and stability of Storm-Cliff, .and the truth of David Chester." Faye put her little hand into his, 'glanc- ing up into his face, and reading therein as limpid truth as it ever was given to mortal face to reveal. : These two souls, whom God and all good angels were trying to win for the heavenly heights, went their way downward from that mountain cliff, and on, over rocks and oozing mosses, to ' Mansfield's Chin.' If the spirit of the mountain had planned to hide its glories for one great out-come of light and :.   FAYE iMA.         125 beauty, no more skillful plan could have been laid than the pathway to "the Chin."  Every footstep requires the utmost attention, and so you walk on breathless, and seeing naught but your own feet, set safely on something firmer than black ooze, until, at the last, you are on the highest bit of earth in Vermont. David Chester and Faye Mar rested beside the cairn on the north-western eminence -of ' the Chin." Neither spoke. It is a speechless emotion that is brought out of the depths of one's being, on witnessing such a field of glory as lies beneath you from that point. Mountain on mountain, range beyond range, with all the river ribbons that run between, and Lake Champlain, golden-flecked in the sunlight, a locket on the throbbing heart of earth, held fast to this hoary head by strings of silver-flashing beads, that alone tell where the rivers run. They two thought themselves alone, when out of the silence a voice came, saying, "Do you think? if mine were the eyes that alone should ever see this sight, the Creator would have built it up for me?   I feel as if it were so, as though every mountain had been laid down from  the Almighty Hand, every rock- hewn, ever tree planted by the same Power, and all for my one human eyes and- heart to rest upon."  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7507-00000065"/> 126        FAYE MAR. "Nay, my friend, for His pleasure they are and were created." The voices came from just behind the cairn of stones, against which our two souls were resting. "Then you surely can not deny me the belief that the more I love Him, the nearer he lets me come to his heart of love, the nearer I come to be- ing a part of that for which all creations were made." The first and last speaker was the little lady who had come up to the mountain out of great afflictions. Miss Mar recognized the voice at the first word spoken, and would have darted around, but Mr. Chester restrained her. At this point merny shouts were heard from a party clambering up the rocks below. No more words were spoken, but Faye went round the cairn to greet her new friend, and soon the two souls were left alone-the little lady having gone on to the other eminence of " the Chin." "Now, Miss Mar, I claim to know my fate:" "It is a good place to learn it; you will need all the strength of these hills to bear it bravely." "kYou speak seriously; what can you mean?" "I am serious; turn your face away, 'there, far away, toward the lake, where I can not see it." He turned. She spoke: "Mr. Chester, Mrs. Chester is to be married."   FAYE MAR.        127 "Miss Mar, do not jest in that way." "Do I look like it? I who spent last night in -thinking, until the power of thought vanished." "Tell me to whom, and why it should give you anxious thoughts?" "O my friend! have you been as "blind as I? It is to my father," David Chester sprang up as if a serpent had been at his feet. He did not turn his face toward poor Faye for many seconds, then he said: "This must not be. For your father's sake, it mulsthe prevented." "How?  I am forbidden to say one word that could excite or annoy him. A second stroke of paralysis might be the consequence. I can never strike him down." "Poor child! And I meant to bring you but happiness. It is true, he must not be excited, and if my mother has determined on this course, opposition is useless. Miss Mar, will you let me make what amends I can, by devoting my life to your happiness?" "Mr. Chester, I can not answer you as I ought, for I am so lost without my father's love, that I thought nothing in this world could ever change. I am certain nothing could ever change mine for him."

Let this mountain be our witness. I have my mother. A Chester promise can not be broken. I promised my father, ere he died, that I would never forsake her, nor will I." Faye was burying the opal light just then ifn the Montreal mountain. Presently she glanced up- ward toward the steadfast eyes that were upon her, and said, ( You do not know how willful I am." "I have known it since the night I found you on Storm-Cliff." "Nor how full of caprices, nor how wicked. That little lady just behind this pile of stones made me seem to myself almost one of the worms she talked of. Pray, MSr. Chester, do not deceive yourself," and she withdrew the opals from the mountain and cast them into Lake Champlain. "I can trust every thing I hold valuable to Faye Mar, D. D." O Mr. Chester! How could you? Nobody but my father ever called me that." ' May I call you Faye Chester, D. D.?" "Are you certain that you will never repent having done so?" "As certain as mortal man can be of any thing in this world." "Then let Mount Mansfield stand our witness. if ever you regret it."   FAYE MAB.        129 "I will," solemnly spoke David Chester. The little party on the eminence full in sight, were unconscious that the moments then passing were fraught with life-interest to the young lady they were discussing across the depression that lay between. David Chester and Faye Mar went down from the mountain that night, bound about with all the bands of truth that this world can give. The house was given to sleep when the little lamp left in the hall shone upon a fair girl, stealing quietly down its depth to a door at the corner, into which she disappeared.  "Papa, are you asleep?" ' ",No, child, what is it?" '"May I come and talk to you a few moments? I can not sleep." "Are you ill, Faye, or tired with the moun- tain?"  ' Neither, I came to tell you something." "Well, my child, I listen."  The moonlight came across the room and touched Faye's face, as she knelt beside the bed-still she did not speak. "Faye! Faye! I never saw it before, but this night you are like your mother. Tell me, child, what troubles you." "It is no trouble, papa. You know 'you have always been all I had to love in the world, and now  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7507-00000067"/> 130       FAYE MAR. it seems so strange--"She paused and hid her face. "What is so strange? Do you think I do not love you just as well as if there were no Mrs. Chester in the world?" "Oh! it is not that, but if it were not for Mrs. Chester, I should not care for any one but you." "And who is it that has come into your life, my D. D.?" "Will it make you unhappy if I tell you that anly one has?" "I trust not, Fay; I can not be with you always, and I would not leave you alone." "I Then let me whisper it, papa." Close to his ear on the pillow came the little coral word-keep- ers, and from them there darted into Major Mar's consciousness the words, "Mr. Chester. If you don't wish it, papa, tell me, and it shall not be." "Faye, when did Mr. Chester speak to you?" "To-day, on the mountain." "Did he know what I told you last night?" "Not until I told him to-day." "My child, go now, let me think until to- morrow." "You are displeased with me?" "No! A thousand times, no; give me one kiss, Faye, then go, sleep, and be happy." "I could not until I had toldl you. Are you sure it will-nat. maie you .iUI?"   FAYE MAR.        131 {' Quite sure, Faye, though if I had known it earlier, it might have been well for me." "It never would have been to tell, if you were not going to be married, papa. I do want you to be happy." "She shall never -know of it, if I am not," thought Major Mar, as Faye left him. As Faye passed Mrs. Chester's room she was quite certain that the door was open "just a crack," but the house was so solemn in its night silence, that she dared not stop to see, but went quickly on to her own room, a sweet sense of peace filling her nature, and glorifying the room, radiant already with moonlight. She had closed the door and turned the key, before she saw a dark shadow steal out of an obscure corner and stand erect in the moonlight. It was Mrs. Chester. "A pretty time of night for a young lady to be going to and fro through the halls of a hotel," she said, disturbing the holy air of the night with words and tones so discordant, that Faye's being bent with a sudden recoil that deprived her of speech. Faye quietly turned the key, and opened the door for Mrs. Chester to pass out, but the woman closed it with a quick jar, that must have rung through the house. "Speak to me, Miss Mar! Where have you been?" .  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7507-00000068"/> 132        FAYE MAR. Faye's fingers clung fast to each other, as she said: "To my father's room." "I don't believe you." The clear, brown eyes of David Chester seemed fixed on Faye, forbidding her to reply. She said not one word; she left the door and walked to the window. There she stood, her golden hair un- folded about her shoulders, her beautiful eyes firmly fixed on the sky. How long they remained thus Faye never knew, it seemed a life-time to her. "Do you hear me say I don't believe you?" reiterated Mrs. Chester. Still no response from the vision in the moon- light. With two or three steps Mrs. Chester reached Faye, and stretched out her hand and wound a lock of Faye's hair about her finger. "Faye Mar," she said, "I shall see the yellow turn to white." "David Chester's mother!" something seemed to whisper, and the girl did not turn her eyes from the sky, until a low sound at the door, and the air of the room, told her that she was alone in it. She almost flew across the room and turned the key, then gasped a sigh of relief, and went to sleep, thinking not of Mrs. Chester, but of him with whom she had talked on the mountain that day.   FAYE MAR.        133 CHAPTER VIII. MARRIED AND NOT MARRIED. No one knew precisely why it was not told to Mrs. Chester; it was not planned that she should be de- prived of the knowledge of the new relationship between her son and Miss Mar, but so it was, and she returned to Storm-Cliff to make ready for her own marriage, leaving Major Mar and his daughter at a place on the coast a hundred miles north of Storm-Cliff. Mrs. Chester, thorough woman of the world, felt in her mind (heart she seemed to have none) that the plan of- delay was not wise, but two months' time Faye had pleaded for, in secret, with her father, and he had granted it. So, for two months, Faye worked her own sweet will and way with the hero of Indian battles, until she conquered him of any first feeling of loss that he may have felt at missing the firm, strong woman, ever willing to administer to his wants. During this time, Major Mar progressed wonderfully in way of recovery.: Something of the old buoyant rnanner came back to Faye, and came more and 6   &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7507-00000069"/> 134        FAYE MAR. more, until one day she astonished her father by exclaiming: 'Papa, let us go back to India. There was nobody there but you and I. We were happy then, but here are too many people." "Never mind, child, we will try what a little West-Indian air can do for us in the winter com-- ing," he replied. The two months went by, and the time came to return to Storm-Cliff for Major Mar's and Mrs. Chester's marriage. It had been quietly arranged that Faye should be married in the spring follow- ing their return from the south. At Storm-Cliff everything was in elegant wait- ing for the event. David Chester had spent his power in efforts to make his mother look upon the matter in a less worldly light, but to no purpose. For days previous to the coming of Major Mar, Mrs. Chester had not spoken to her son. The marriage was to be at Storm-Cliff, with only the family of the clergyman to witness it. Major Mar arrived two days before the given time. He had been a little delayed by the non- arrival of a steamer by which he expected letters; the steamer being over-due, he ordered them for- warded to Storm-Cliff. The morning of thd mar- riage came, also the expected letters. Faye was. attired for the ceremony; coming down the stair- cae, she met toe -iervaat with the -cWra,i a,4d ' . - ..- * s * - **    FAYE MAR.         135 took them into her father's room. She offered to read them, but he declined, and his nerves, grown quite firm with coming health, never quivered, as he broke the seal of the first. He read it, threw it from him, and eagerly seized the second. He had scarcely read the half of it, when Faye, who stood watching and wondering at his want of calmness, which she never thought of attributing to the letters, saw a peculiar leaden hue go over his face, and then-she knew not what she did, but those who told, said a shriek rang through the house. Mrs. Chester was dressing for her marriage. Only David and the servant ran to see what the cry meant. It seemed there was to be no marriage that day. The clergyman arrived. He laid aside his ceremonial air, to administer to him who had re- ceived the second mysterious stroke of Providence. Major Mar tried to speak, but utterance was denied.  He would not give up the'effort to make known that which he tried to convey in words. The day wore on. Mrs. Chester had read the letters. It was she who had gathered them from the floor. Faye had not given them a second thought.  "Mrs. Chester   wishes you, Mister David," was an order that the son recognized by instant departure to the lady's presence. "Well, mother, T am  sorry your plans are A9 woes    -ly 4efated' he ot,-  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7507-00000070"/> 136        FAYE MAR. "David, it is one of those things for which I shall only be too thankful, that he got these letters before the ceremony, for it would not have looked well in the eyes of the world, to have left his daughter without a home. Now, it is so different; she is nothing to me now, whereas, she would have been my step-daughter. Read these'letters. Major Mar's property is gone to the four winds, unless he has been deceiving us by false pretenses from the beginning." "Read his letters, mother! How could you? But-I forget-you are not a Chester." It was the severest thing the son had ever said to the mother. HBe took the letters and returned them to Faye, who was beside her father. As lhe reached out his hand to convey them to hers, Major Mar made an effort that was almost superhuman to lay his hand on them, and his attempts at speech were without doubt made concerning them. "What is it, papa?  Is it any think we can do?" He pressed her hand. "Perhaps, Miss Mar, if you read the letters, you will understand." Faye read them. The color left her face. "Mr. Chester," she gasped, " we are beggars, dependent, possibly, on your bread this day." "The sweetest beggar that ever sued," replied   FA*YE MAR.        137 David Chester.  c Miss Mar, I think I have your father's meaning. Leave. me with him a moment; go no further than the hall, please." In a moment David Chester opened the door. "Come!" he said.   "I am right, is it not so, Major Mar?   You would see your daughter my wife to-day." If human face can speak, Major Mar's did, in the light that came over it. Faye hesitated; his face fell. A look, new with suffering, passed over it. The daughter, seeing, answered: "Papa, I will; I am. ready." The clergyman was recalled. Mrs. Chester had not been in attendance on the man she would have married that morning, and -when summoned to the room, she was tardy; so late, that the words of the clergyman, commencing the solemn service smote on her ear the instant she entered. In the  bewilderment that took possession of her, she did not see David Chester, with the    little figure, clothed in white, standing   beside the bed  on which Major Mar had been laid. She thought she had been summoned to be married. The servants in the room looked with astonishment at her sudden withdrawal from the door, into which she had scarcely come. Without the- lady, the marriage service went on, even to the final words; and from the poor, stricken face of the father, the daughter  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7507-00000071"/> 138        FAYE MAR. wiped the tears that paralysis had not forbidden to flow. Mrs. Chester's bell rang violently. To the serv- ant who answered the summons, Mrs. Chester said, "Tell my son to come to me instantly." David Chester came. "What mockery was that? Can a woman be. married, and not be present? David, who planned to get me there? Did you?" "No, mother, the bride was there; she is now Mrs. Chester, my wife." "Not Faye Mar!" almost shrieked Mrs. Ches- ter. "Yes, mother, she was Faye Mar." "Go! go from my sight! I will not stay an- other night under this roof." As he attempted to speak, she waved him off. f "No! no! Was ever mother so abused?  All my care, from your childhood up, to be rewarded thus? Let me go, I say." She was going from the room in a state of frenzy, but David put his arms about her, and again within those rooms words were spoken between mother and son that other ears were not meant to hear. In the late autumn of that year, Major Mar passed from earth. The last days may have been his best days. They were faithfully and fondly cared for? by his son and daughter. Mrs. QCheter   FAYE MAR.         139 never again entered his rooms.  She made it convenient to visit a relative for the first time that autumn, and was absent when the death hour drew nigh. The clergyman who had been called to perform Major Mar's marriage ceremony, did his utmost, as a faithful follower of his Master, to prepare the soul that was departing for the more august cere- monials in which/it was soon to take part. After the death and burial, Mrs. Chester would not return to Storm-Cliff. The house was closed, and Mr. and Mrs. David Chester went to England, to find Major Mar's possessions had not entirely departed from the rightful owner. Once there, they lingered, until the estate was closed, and then went through Europe, Faye delighting to show her husband places that had given her so much pleasure when seen with her father. They had been twelve months at Storm-Cliff, after their return, when Mrs. Chester announced her determination to take up her residence there. Had David Chester known   what had passed be- tween his mother and his wife, he would not have deemed that even the   Chester honor demanded they should live under the same roof; but he did not know it then, nor ever.  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7507-00000072"/> "O       FATE M}AR. CHAPTER IX. DRIPPING HAIR AND TRAILING VINES-MRS. CHESTER'S FIERY ADVENT. REV. MR. MONROE, who called at Storm-Cliff on the night in which David Chester went down to the ocean with his burden of unrest, was the cler- gyman who had comforted Major Mar in his final hours, and married his daughter and Mr. Chester. The light of the love which had never gone down, no, not for an hour, since that time, still rested on Faye's brow, as she gave her hand in token of wel- come. The storm moaned and groaned over and through the leaf-laden trees which had grown to forest- size around Storm-Cliff. .Something of the night was clinging to Mr. Monroe, or came in with him at the door.  Faye felt it, and the thought came, "I am sure David will not be out long this night;" but Mr. Monroe remained and talked with the little lady until past ten, and still no Mr. Chester came in to greet him.   The good man went his way wondering. He marveled   VAYE MAR.    ;    141 where Mr. Chester could have gone on such a night, but yet more at the color that flushed and faded in Mrs. Chester's face, as sounds came and passed; now it would be brilliant with the light of the blood, then pale as her own dress. At first, he had staid out of pity, thinking to make the time less, then went out of pity, for an ill that he could not alleviate. When he had gone, Mrs. Chester seated herself again on the rug, and listened with her folded hands tightly clenched. Nothing came but the raging of the storm. The clock on the mantel struck eleven. At the stroke, sounds of footsteps along the hall made her heart leap. Was it so long time since David Chester went that she had forgotten the tread of his feet she thought she knew so well? for it was only the servant, who came to ask if he should close the house. "The bell might have rung," he thought, ' without his hearing it," "You need not stay up to-night," she said,' "it is so wild I can not-sleep."  Not one word about her husband would' she speak. The man went -away, as Mr. Monroe had done, wondering where Mr. Chester could be, on such a night - Twelve struck the clock, and he had not come, ." Poor Olive, waiting up for me," thought- Mrs. Chester, :who had forgotten her. There was something  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7507-00000073"/> "2        FAYE MAR. weird and lonely in that stroke of twelve, coming in and shutting out for a moment the mighty march of the storm. The house was so still. Little Mrs. Chester was not a nervous, timid woman, "afraid of nothing"/' as the courageous say, sneeringly. Now, if there is one thing beyond another that excites fear, it is that terrible unre- ality, "Nothing." Find me a place in the uni- verse filled with nothing, and you have found the very place of fear. Even nature shrinks from it, and abhors a vacuum. To Mrs. Chester, the hall was tenantless; the very fact that it held nothing mortal, made her run, breathless and panting, up the long staircase. Olive was waiting for her mistress, but in waiting had gone a bit of the way into sleep, so that it required a touch to call her back. "O Mrs. Chester! T did not intend to go to sleep; is it late?" And Olive aroused to the performance of her nightly duties. For the second time since she entered into Mrs. Chester's service, she was dismissed without performing them. "Olivel" called Mrs. Chester as she was going. The girl waited. "Nothing; you may go." It was a lingering longing for human presence that made her call, but, intuitively true, this little woman would have no one come between herself and her husband, whom she thought she knew thoroughly, whose every passing emotion she had   kYE MAtl,       143 read during the years in which she had been a wife. A thought that David Chester could leave her, never entered her soul. In refusing his request that his mother  should live with them, she had given her first denial; but then he had always been so considerate that she never, until that time, had known the opportunity. "If I could only tell him," she murmured; " if he but knew, from some other tongue, how his mother hates me, even he could not ask it." And she went on thinking in this wise: "I let the woman come in and steaL!my father from me, but my husband no one shall alienate. And if she came, I could not live in peace with her; I should speak every day of my life words that, true though they would be, any husband could not bear to hear. No, no! the woman who wrought so ill toward my father, can not dwell at peace with me. It is my right as a wife, and I will cling to it; but David rmust not stay out; where can he be?"The last thought was more emotion than thought, as a vivid flash of lightning paled the light of the room. She made the room brilliant, letting light spring into every corner, looped the curtains back, and thought, "Now, if he is coming home, he will know that I am waiting for him."' The room she illuminated was just over the library, and looked out upon the ocean.

There was nothing to see, except when the lightning came; and in one of those wonderful photographs the lightning lets in on sight to live forever there, she saw the ocean, the great white cliff, and the terrible, storm-driven surge of the waves. "( What if he be down there!" she thought; "what if this terrible sea take him from me as it took my father!" Impelled by the forceful thought, the little wo- man sprang up, not heeding her white array and floating hair, she caught a shawl and went down. No longer were the wide halls tenantless: her hus- band's feet were sounding through them with that tread that was ever welcome; his words of love surged in at her ears, drowning the storm-voices that shook the air into which she entered. The great door closed after her, and with a mighty sweep the wind seemed to take her up and bear her onward. Now and then she paused, clinging to a tree in her pathway, and called, "David! David!" There was no answer, and she turned and beat her way' down toward the sea. The rain poured without pity an her golden hair until she seemed a part of the storm, and went dripping on with it. The gnarled old wild trees of cherry, the last bit of   FAYE MAR.        145 vegetation except sedge-grass that lay between her and the roaring sea, came and went, and Faye Chester stood in the awful majesty of the ocean. She waited for a flash to come. It came, and she looked up the coast. The picture gave no living thing. She waited until the heavens opened with another flood of light. Storm-Cliff seemed to hold the lightning fixed a second on its hoary head, then shook with a might of thunder that held the very ocean tremulous with sound.   There comes a silence after thunder, and in that silence the wife cried out, "David! O David!" In that hour of mortal fear, Faye Chester looked landward, and saw the shining light let let down from the far-away windows, and in her heart there had time to come a little leap of glad- ness that she had left the light to lure him. home. But where was he?  Nothing seemed to give him back to her, nor night, nor storm, nor ocean; and even heaven's own light withheld him from her sight. "I wish Mrs. Chester were dead!" she cried in her anguish, marching down the dripping sands just above the breakers' deadly roll. Her slippers were soaked; the sands clung like weights to them. She cast them off and went on down toward the little harbor. Mrs. Chester had forgotten the ru- mors that had come up from the village. - They told of smugglers sometimes going there, but, in- 7  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7507-00000075"/> "6        FAYE MAR. tent on finding her husband, she went on with only a thought of him. The tiny basin was shut in by rocks. It had once in time been a cavern, whose roof-rock had fallen, through many beatings of waves; and, clinging to the sharp points, this little soul of ours climbed to look over--to look over where there was nothing to see. "David!" she called again. There came for answer, the forked lightning. They caught a vision of her, those daring men within the harbor, who held no fear of law, divine or human, and thought they had seen a ghost. She slid down the rocks, the frightful picture of the faces working in on her brain, never heeding bruises, welcoming the very strokes of the storm, and. ran, helped on now by the wind, toward Storm-Cliff. The house was as she had left it. Cliff-Lane had worn away something of the sand-fringe that had clung to her garments when she shook them at the entrance. Softly letting to the great door, she went on up to her own rooms. Something new in life had come. to those opal eyes that buried themselves in the welcome, steady glow of the coals that burned in the grate. She sat down before it, scarcely heeding the bruises of rocks and storm, until she chanced to see a crimson color coming through a worn stocking. It grew and grew, and she watched it until a drop fell on the white marble of the hearth.   PAYE MAR.        147 At that moment David Chester looked into the room. An irresistible desire had taken possession of the man to see how his wife would bear his absence. Had he gone down deeper into his nature, he would have found the desire born of a wish to see her for herself alone; but he only thought of it in the other light, as he turned from his long tossing on the sands above the Cliff, to go homeward. There was a trellis leading up over the bay- window of the library, which he had often climbed when- a boy. He tried it as a man, and at the mo- ment his wife saw the drop of blood fall on the marble, he looked in. He saw her take off the stockings and lay them on the coals, and watched, while she staid the blood, binding up the bruise, with a pretty dainti- ness of doing that charmed him, as motion of hers had a  thousand times before. She threaded her dripping hair, and rested her head against the jam to let it dry. He watched her face resting there, and saw nothing but the love for himself, and thought in his heart, "I know that little woman well; to-morrow, she will let me have my way." He thought thus, while his wife was growing more firm in her determination, with every mo- ment he staid away.

It had touched on a sharp, under-ocean peak that God had built, far out of human sight. Would it hold? At last, a sense of weariness came, the vital forces all spent in the struggle with the storm, and the little head drooped lower and lower, the eyes closed, and arousing for an instant, Mrs. Chester put a pillow on the hearth-rug and lay down. David Chester was shivering outside, holding fast to the slight hold he had, but still he stood and watched his wife sleeping there; watched while the heat of the fire rolled and curled each gleaming thread of gold, half afraid to turn his eyes lest a coal should part from the mass and fall upon her. Perhaps he felt that he should not sorrow overmuch if his mother never came again unto him; at least, the look of such emotion passed his face, ere he turned to go. The night was far speht. He went in. The door into the room where he had left her, stood ajar, and he entered, glad to feel the warmth of the room. He dried his gar- ments as best he could, and waited for the day to come. All days seemed far away to him. He could not rest. When the storm hushed itself to peace in the early day, David Chester got up and went out. The time of calm had come to nature,   FAYE MAR.        149 not to him. Should he break the Chester honor? say to that wife of his, "My mother shall find another abiding place, and you and I will dwell forever together?" As he questioned with himself, he looked down at the ruby gem he wore for an- swer, and it came not. The ruby was gone. With face downward, he, forgetful of all -besides, retraced the way he had gone in the night, looking for it. The storm had. worn out all signs of feet from Cliff-Lane. Over the beach the tide had come-and gone since he went down the night before. The jewel was lost. - He felt that the great deep had swallowed it from his sight. A fateful prophecy it seemed to him, for the thought that he had had, "believing that his wife was dearer than all else," and so the gem, taking warning, lest he should dim its glory, had gone back to nature. "I will be firm," he thought.  "My promise given to the dead shtall be kept, or I go--"And with the thought of going came in many others. Since his return he had been living at ease at Storm-Cliff, thinking to find enough to do in the management of lands, only half tilled during his long absence. Still thinking, he went his way across the beach homeward, and in going found a little slipper. It had been out and in with the tide, and was filled with sand. 'David Chester stooped and took it in his hand. Then he knew it  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7507-00000077"/> 150   '     FAYE MAR. for his wife's. He had noticed it only the night before, as she wore it. It taught him that she had been down on that fearful shore, looking for him. The cable gained a little strength just then. The worn and surf-beaten slipper, all filled with sand, he put in his pocket as a treasure from which he would never be parted. He went home to break- fast. Going in without encountering any one, he was in his dressing-room making ready, when his wife heard the movement there, and knocked, call- ing, "David, is it you? May I come in?" "Certainly, Faye." She looked a moment at him and then buried her eyes close to his heart. He was the first to speak, she trembled so, that he feared she would shrink and fall, as twice he had seen her fall. "Faye, do you think I do not love you because I went away last night?" "No, David, I shall never think that." "Never, Faye?" "Never, David!"And the sweet face was up- lifted with an assurance upon it, that made the man's heart glad, even in its bitterness. "Bless you for your faith in me, Faye; you will need it." "I shall have it," she said, " even if you carry out your dreadful threat." "Threatl and to you! What can you mean?"   FAYE MAR.        151 s What you said about not staying here." "Have you thought better of it, and deter- mined to make my mother as happy as you can?" "No, David, I will not. She is your mother. I can tell you nothing regarding her, but simply this: I will not live with her. I love my husband too well." "And I, my honor too well to break it. Faye, the ruby is gone."  How?" " Lost last night, when you sent me forth, with your denial." "I will find it for you, David." "Impossible, though you sift the sands on the shore." "I think I shall find it, nevertheless," she said; "I feel that I shall." The bell for, breakfast rang, and they went down. For the hour, the thorn that had entered into their hearts grew quiet. Each felt too happy in the presence of the other, to welcome the un- pleasant theme. After breakfast, Mrs. Chester insisted on going down to the shore to search for the lost ruby, and would have her husband to go with her, remem- bering the menin the harbor, but of that she did not speak, knowing it involved the story of being on the coast in the night.  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7507-00000078"/> 152       FAYE MAR. The search was without finding. A cloud came over the spirit of David Chester on their home- ward way. , He repented already the rash words that he had spoken; and that made one of two courses imperative, either to retract them, or to leave Storm-Cliff. So these words came, of that cloud -on his spirit. "Faye, I am going to Boston for a few days." "O David! I am so glad. I have been hoping that you would, but you were so much interested in the field over there, that I thought you would not leave. When shall we go?" "We?" She looked up at him, inserting a little hand, that had for an hour been buried in sea-shore sand, searching for the Chester ruby, into his, with a clasp so loving, that for an instant, this man's heart stood still, then shook with a throb of agony at what his own words had wrought. She had not spoken; the look, told its own story. "Well, what if I say you are not to go?" "Hush, David, you will not say it." "And during our absence we will go down and see my mother, and she can return with us." "David! do you remember that day on Mount Mansfield? Are you coming to the point where the mountain itself shall stand between us?" "Never, Faye, a thousand times never. No-   FAYE MAR.         153 thing that can ever come between you and me, shall make me regret the marriage day." "Not even if I am firm?" "No, though you drive me out to wander over the earth, by persisting in this, to me, most un- reasonable thing that woman ever did." "Once for all, I can not alter my determina- tion; never, with my consent, shall Mrs. Chester come to live here, unless I go hence." In his heart Mr. Chester. thought that his - wife was not well; that this obstinacy, it seemed to him, was purely the result of illness; but the brightness of her face looked far more like deter- mined health. He made ready. She did not. He would have driven down to the afternoon train, but something, he scarcely knew what, (I think it was inclination) made him late. "He would meet the night train," he said. His baggage lay ready, in the hall. The carriage was at the door, and he, foolish man, was waiting over the farewell to his wife, when Olive came in upon them, sans ceremony. "O Miss Faye!" she gasped, the first time she had made the mistake in all the little lady's mar- ried life, "Mrs. Chester has come. I just saw the carriage drive up." ' David Chester went down to meet his mother,  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7507-00000079"/> 154        FAYE MAR. feeling that she had done him angel service by this unexpected coming. Mrs. David Chester was only a step or two be- hind him. His welcome was scarcely spoken when she gave hers. "There! there! child, I don't want a stranger to welcome me to my son's house," was the re- sponse to the kindly words. The opal eyes flashed for one instant a light that told of warmer hues, but the sweet smile and "thank you " that shone upon and was whispered in at her ear by her husband, subdued the flash, and she quietly followed Mrs. Chester in. "We were not expecting you," she said, " or I would have had a fire in your room. If you will wait here a few minutes, it shall be lit." "I will order it myself. I dare say the new set of people you've got in the house know nothing of the proper way to build fires. What's the per- son's name?" "I will see that it is made after your own style," pleasantly replied the little lady, remembering yet her husband's thankfulness. On the hearth in Mrs. Chester's room, trying to make every stick of wood lie at just such an angle, David Chester found his wife. I' Why, Faye, what is this? Is there no one to light a fire but you?"   FAYE MAR.         155 "I feared to have any one try, lest it should not please." "That is one. of mother's whims," he said. "' Make it as you will, and she will take it down and rebuild it. I've tried it often." "Who wouldn't? Such a fire as that!" said Mrs. Chester, entering. Now it was a very fire to please, full and fine and ruddy with blaze, but the ancient tongs demolished it and filled the room with smoke. "I declare! David, you haven't had the chim- neys burned out, I do believe," "True, mother, but I think the smoke is quite unnecessary." "Any housekeeper would know better than to neglect the chimneys." "I suppose it is my fault," spoke Mrs. David Chester, " but I never thought of it, the draught seems strong and clear." By the time Mrs. Chester had put the wood into position, the room was stifling with smoke, but through smoke and twilight her clear-seeing eyes caught the changes in the room.   Her son had gone down, but his wife stood irresolute for a  moment. In that moment Mrs. Chester went about the   room  gathering  together .every new thing that had been placed in the room since her last occupation  of it.

C There!" exclaimed the indignant woman, her black eyes scintillant with rage, "the next time any one attempts to C fix up' my rooms, let them beware: how dare you disturb anything here?" And as she advanced toward the little figure hovering near the door, it vanished out of her sight, speechless. "Look, here, David Chester!" greeted that man's hearing, not two minutes later, " am I to come back to my husband's house and find it all turned topsy-turvy by an alien? Just see what has been put into rooms that no one ever had the ordering of, no, not even to move a chair out of its place in your father's lifetime." "Mother, Faye intended no ill; on the con- trary, she put her choicest treasures to beautify the rooms; we use them for visitors now." "Do you call me a visitor, pray?" Before he could reply, his wife, who had entered, said: " I do, Mrs. Chester, and wish to show you all the courtesies of the house, if you will permit me." "Impertinence!" exclaimed Mrs. Chester, in a rage. "' David, will you permit your mother to be so treated under this roof?"   FAYE MAR.         157 - Mother, I am  positive that you can never receive any but kind attention, if you will be con- tent to receive it from the kindest little soul in the world. Come to tea!"    Saying this, he offered his mother an arm to conduct her down the stairs, but she swept by him with her old stately air and entered the tea-room before he reached it. Mrs. David Chester divined her intent, and, gliding in behind her, stood an instant with her hand upon the chair placed at the tea-urn. "David!" said his mother, " am I to take any other place at this table except that which I have always filled?  I couldn't eat one mouthful, if I sat elsewhere." "Robert, move the urn, and give Mrs. Chester this place, to which she has been used," said Mrs. David, without the slightest hesitation. Foiled in her purpose, there were only monosyl- lables to be obtained from the traveler of the day. Three times she returned her cup of tea for changes, and every time, with the most patient air of courtesy, she, who presided at the urn, tried to please her taste. "What is the matter with the silver?" finally asked Mrs. Chester, content to sit in silence no longer. "It never looked so in my time; it is as black as if it never knew brightness." "It was robbed to-day," said her son's wife. 7 .  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7507-00000081"/> 158        PAYE MAR. "With charcoal? It looks like it." "Mother!" exclaimed Mr. Chester, having given his wife the signal for dismissing the attendant. "Once for all, let me state that no one dictates to my wife; if her manner of housekeeping does not please you, you must remember that she has had but twelve months' experience." "Some folks never learn. She wasn't brought up to housekeeping. It's as good as I expected to find it." If Mrs. Chester had ever wielded the power of love over her son's wife, the rude and bitter words spoken would have gone down into her heart and brought tears of grief; but she bore them from the cold, hard woman in patient silence, because of the great love that sat beside her and seemed to take all the weight of them from her. At length Mrs. Chester had sipped the last drop from the last cup of tea, and the three arose from the table. "Will you take a little walk about the garden and grounds-I have some choice plants to show you-I recollect you were always fond of flowers?" asked Mrs. David Chester. "Why don't you call me mother? ' I should think 'twould sound a trifle more civilized." The color deepened on Mrs. David Chester's face as she replied; "Yot know I never had a   FAYE MAR.         159 mother, and it does not come natural to use the word." "Well, you can practice, now that you have one. I will go and look at your plants." A trumpet-creeper had wreathed itself about the trellis, overarching the window of the library, and, in his climbing the night before, Mr. Chester had torn it from its fastenings. The twilight scarcely lingered with sufficient force to see any thing distinctly, but Mrs. Chester caught a glimpse of the trailing vine. "I knew the place would all run down without me; here's this vine that I put out with my own hands, I tended it, and trimmed it, and watered it, and took all the care of it for so many years, and now just look at it." "I hope it is not broken; the storm  must have blown it down; the wind blew a gale last night. I suppose it must lie as it is until morning," said her companion. "I always went around and looked after things when a storm was over." "The gardener shall give it his care the first thing in the morning." "The gardener! I never left such things as that vine to a gardener." "May be David wouldn't like me to get-up so high, and, besides, I'm not certain' that I could make it fast if I did."

"I'll be there directly," said the elder, and Mrs. David Chester went to find her husband. "Are you going to Boston to-night?" she asked. "What! Leave my mother on the first night of her coming! You couldn't wish me to be so rude, Faye?" ' I couldn't wish you to go under any circum- stances, leaving me." "Where is my mother?" "Gone up-stairs. She will be here directly." The choicest easy chair was put into position, and thus it remained until it had grown quite dark, yet no Mrs. Chester. "I must go and look for her. What can have chanced to keep her so?" said her son. Mrs. Chester was tying up the trumpet-creeper in the darkness. She was discovered by the noise she made. "Mother!" exclaimed Mr. Chester, " do come in and leave that for the night." ' I never left a vine half hanging, half lying on the ground, not for a day, and I can't abide such carelessness." "It was quite my fault, mother. I broke it down, and forgot it." "You pray! How?"   FAYE MAR.        161 Mr. Chester did not hear the question, for he had entered the house. He was at her side a minute later wrapping a shawl about her shoul- ders. It chanced to be one his wife had worn in their morning walk. No sooner had Mrs. Chester touched the shawl than she threw it from her shoulders. "Take it away, I don't want her shawl! Thank Providence, I've enough of my own; if not, I'll borrow Martha Sing's," she said. "I am glad you are thankful for even a shawl mother." He gathered it from the ground and went in. That night Mrs. Chester summoned a servant who formerly lived at Storm-Cliff to her room. The girl was one of those unstable persons who turn as easily as a wind-vane to every influence that stirs in their presence. "Well, Jane, and how are things going since you came back?" "Pretty well, madam." ' You like your new mistress, then?" "Yes, ma'am, she don't interfere much." "Too happy with her husband, I suppose?" "Some things don't look much like it." "What things, pray?

"I don't know as there's much to tell; but they say down-stairs, that Mr. Chester was out all night somewhere, and Mrs. Chester sitting up for him; and Dorothy-she's a new one-declares Olive was washing out a white dress on the sly this morning that looked for all the world just as if it had been washed up by the tide; but Olive is such a close thing there's no finding out any thing by her." "Very well, Jane. If you hear any thing more, come to me." "Yes, ma'am." "That is all." Jane went, and her former mistress sat and thought far into the night. The subject of her thought was not written on the air, but as she arose, these words escaped her lips: "It's coming! I knew 'twould." A week passed. No improvement in mind or manner came to Mrs. Chester, who occupied her time in censuring the wife her son had chosen. The object of all these attentions endured them with a brave spirit, until, one day, having failed to exasperate her in any other way, Mrs. Chester said: "Now, if David had married Clara Pall, or some young woman more fitted for his position in the world, things in the house would have gone on differently."   'FAYE MAR.        163 ' Who is Clara Pall? I never heard of her." And the opal eyes gleamed fitfully as she spoke. "Very likely not. She couldn't come here after David's attentions to her so many years.   I wouldn't if I had been she." "Who is she?" again asked Mrs. David Chester. "She is a young lady from Boston who comes to the village every summer. I dare say she is here now. I wonder you did not meet her at the Beach-House." a Why did not your son marry her?" "Why didn't I marry whom?"      The voice startled the former speakers, neither knowing Mr. Chester to be within hearing. ' Miss Clara Pall!" said his wife. ' Because I never thought of it." "Why did you not tell me of her?" "I must give you the same answer. She did not come into my memory." "Is she here now?" "Faye, I do not know. She never interested me in the least." Notwithstanding this entire denial on the part of her son, Mrs. Chester failed not to set Clara Pall into Storm-Cliff associations with every hour in the day. The poor little wife grew half frantic with the sound of the name, before one week had closed.  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7507-00000084"/> 164        FAYE MAR. CHAPTER X. THE LAND THAT HELD C THE GRAVE."  A LONG, sweet, dreamy-calm had fallen on the land and the ocean after the equinoctial, and, in that time of peace, came a Sunday. Mrs. David Chester needed the peace of God, ' which passeth all understanding" (how sweet the words are to the blessed few through whose soul the peace passeth, leaving them for evermore under its guardian wings!) to endure the inflic- tions of her mother-in-law; but failing in that, she so longed for one day of rest, that, when Sun- day came, she remained at home. Mrs. Chester seemed to fill the carriage with stateliness and dignity, as, with her son beside her, the little wife watched their departure for thel( church in the village. The Chester pew was fitted up with a style of its own; and she, who had been so long absent from it, swept up the aisle with silken-rustle and sweep of lace, and bowed her head within it.   FAYE MAR.        165 The season was almost over. But few strangers lingered at the Beach-House; and, save the few, and a half-dozen families living on old estates, embracing a circuit of as many miles, the congre- gation was made up of the fishing population of the village. The folds in Martha Sing's shawl were yet bright and fresh as when it first was worn, as its wearer fol- lowed Mrs. Chester a little of the distance up the aisle. This Martha Sing was one of the blessed few over whom the peace of God had passed, and on its wings had' borne from off her heart that weary weight of wishing for the child who had gone into heaven through the dark water-gates. Since He who had taken it in his own way, came so near to her that she could feel no other presence in the Dimple, a great and wonderful change had been wrought in her soul. She no longer went about sorrowing. The small puny cares of every-day life were uplifted before her vision, to all the grandeur of temple service. A sense of dumbness came over her; she could not speak his glories forth, but she could'live in and throughi them. And so a light, truly Divine, radiated from the fisherman's wife, and was shed abroad upon all who knew her.

It was her first going to church. She had come from her nine years' home, to 'return no more.

David Chester's father had given an organ to the church, in which he worshipped; and Ailee Lee, who, during the nine years of her life had lis- tened to the mighty thunderings of the ocean, heard that mor ning reverberations from the ocean of man's emotions, and, but dimly comprehend- ing, she slipped a little hand into Martha Sing's and wept. Storm-Cliff was very quiet, with David Chester gone; and his wife, longing for rest, knew not where to find it. Faye Mar had been taught that to read the Holy Scriptures was one of the duties of life. As such, Faye Chester took a little Bible from a table and read; but rest came not with reading. Looking out from the window to which her husband had come to look upon her when she knew it not, she saw the flood of sunlight   PAYE MAR.        167 spread out upon the blue distance, and in her heart she said: "The sea is like me, it can not- rest." A sympathy, born of the feeling, drew her down to it. There is a love for the' ocean that dwells in some natures, as a vital force. To such natures it comes as a necessity that will not be denied; they must have the mysterious companionship of the ocean. To other souls the mountains are a need; heads will not rest, unless leaning against some height on a far-away horizon, that in child- hood was the earth's utmost bound; hearts will not throb healthfully, unless through them run the aerial airs of highlands. To this little woman of whom I write, the tide- ful unrest of the waters was a vital need; and on this Sunday morning, she went down to it, and on the crest of Storm-Cliff there came to her a ser- mon. It grew out of the experience of love; she re-lived her child-life, sweet and unclouded as it had been, with the one black bar extending across it, that told of school-days in England. And then that other love which had known no dimming, came.  Sitting thus, under its power, she was suddenly carried back to a church at Strasbourg. Ocean and cliff were merged into a side-door, through 'which two souls were let in privately. They walked up and down the aisles of the church  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7507-00000086"/> 168        FAYE MAR. after twilight, alone. A feeling prompted one to kneel at a stiff old confessional, and there to her sweetest of father confessors, acknowledge her naughty love for him. Just as sweet an answer of love for the fair penitent was breathed back; and, with a sense of queer naughtiness at what they had done, they began to be very good. In the darkness, for it was like midnight, save far away at the high altar, where one dim taper was like a tiny star-all senses concentrated in one-there burst upon the hearing, the tones of the sublime organ. From the faintest whisper of sound to its inconceivable volume of power, then the richest depths of harmonious chords, and oh! so strangely sweet-the voice-stop-the cry of the human voice-so like, so strange! These two souls seemed filled with heavenly con- ceptions at one moment; in the next, the tears poured forth like rain at their own sinfulness and unworthiness. Strange visions came and went, and rich old memories that tongue or pen can never tell, in which earth was lost and only tears remained. At length, Mrs. Chester came back to the pres- ent. For an instant, she was filled with surprise to see how far the afternoon sun had journeyed toward the west. "They must have missed me," she thought, and   FAYE MAR.         169 hastened home. As she reached the house, the sound of the dinner-bell was heard. "What! Dinner without my order!"This to a servant who rang the bell. ' "Dinner was ordered up by Mrs. Chester. There's company to 'dinner, I believe; an extra plate was put on  " All flushed with her hurried walk, and unpre- pared as she was, the little wife went straight to the dining-room; and when, in quick obedience to the summons, voices were heard along the hall and persons came in, Mrs. David Chester stood in her place. A sharp, quick glance of chagrin passed across - the face of the mother-in-law, and she said, "Miss Pall, this is my son's wife, Mrs. David Chester." A smile, involuntary, but scarcely one of court- esy, it had so little to do with the greeting, came and went, and Mrs. David Chester had welcomed their guest. Mr. Chester caught the smile and returned it fathoming its true meaning.  - "Miss Pall is going to Boston to-morrow, and, ai I heard David say he should goj I  invited her to come down with me to make their plans for go- ing meet," said Mrs. Chester. "'I regret that you did not mention the fact to me, mother, for I  am  not positive about going 8  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7507-00000087"/> 170        FAYE MAR. to-morrow, and shall be very sorry to disappoint Miss Pall," said Mr. Chester. The latter part of the sentence was addressed to the lady concerned. "It will not make the slightest difference with me, Mr. Chester, a day sooner or later; I would defer a journey any time for the sake of pleasant company." "You ought to know Miss Pall well enough by this time to comprehend that, David." "Mother, persons change, or should, during five years." "Don't tell me it is five years since I have seen you!" cried Miss Pall, with a little pantomimie of horror, " it makes me feel so old." Is five years any longer to one age than another, Miss Pall?" asked Mrs. David Chester, with her most charming manner. c Now, I am five years older than I was when I first came to Storm-Cliff, yet I never feel old." "Giddy children never do!" was the decisive comment of Mrs. Chester. The smile, whose meaning David Chester had so readily divined, came in response to a mem- ory. One evening, long before, when it had been cold and stormy, and the two souls were among tl6e Alps, he had amused her by descriptive pic- tures of persons whom he had known, she, the   FAYE MAR.        171 while, to find them by his detail among the living coals on the hearth. One of the pictures had been Miss Pall. It was so vivid at the time that she begged the name; but he denied her, saying, that the original might some time appear, and he pre- ferred the picture to wear no name. The instant Mrs. David Chester saw Miss Pall, the name was found. Mrs. Chester was of eminent respectability. Not for worlds would she have her son pay attend tions to Miss Pall that would call forth the zoorld's censure; but she was quite willing to agonize Faye Chester's heart with the thought; but, even there, she failed--how utterly, she might have known, had she been been permitted to hear the words with which that Sunday's life had ended. The visit to Boston was appointed for Wednes- day. Mrs. Chester urged Miss Pall to remain at Storm-Cliff; and Mrs. David Chester, seconded the invitation so cordially, that the first-named lady was forced to abandon Miss Pall as an ally. Major Mar had been interred in the burial- ground of the Chesters. -The spot was one of nature's loveliest gems on all the coast; and, with the consent of her husband, Mrs. David Chester  had worked out her own plans of decoration. It had been the sweetest employment of her summer-  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7507-00000088"/> 172        FAYE MAR. time; and there, if ever missing, her husband was certain to find his wife. Miss Pall remained at Storm-Cliff; and Mrs. Chester having taken her under especial patron- age, on Monday morning, Mrs. David quietly went down to superintend the removal of certain plants, the coming cold would destroy. This little lady meant to be so good on that Monday morn- ing-she had fully determined to bear bravely, to the end of Mrs. Chester's visit, whatever bearable inflictions might be put upon her, for the sake of her husband's greater love. Waiting for the gardener to come, she sat down close beside the grave that was so precious in her sight, and began to wind about her fingers the tendrils of a lovely clematis. The seed from whence it had sprung had ripened on a vine that clambered about Major Mar's bungalow.   His daughter finding it, after his death, had put it the nearest thing to his grave, and all the summer through had rejoiced in its growth. The clematis, as she twined its tendrils, awak- ened olden memories in -her heart; and she began to sing a low melody full of lullaby and home- tones with which she had often-times hushed to sleep him who slept below, when he suffered from a fearful headache, caused by the torrid heat of the climate.   FAYE MAR.         173 Wrapped in the song and its memories, she did not hear coming steps, and was surprised into silence, by a hand that swept with one fell swoop past her face and buried itself in the clematis. Mrs. Chester had accomplished her purpose with that serpentine power of darting upon her prey, which such natures possess; but Mrs. David Ches- ter, divining her intent, had caught the hand that held the vine, and clinging to it with all her strength she cried out, "Mrs. Chester, you shall not!-' "I will not have this place filled with weeds and  trash," said Mrs. Chester, struggling at the tendrils she held; but the small hands that held hers down   were armed by the  mighty power of love, and thev yielded not a muscle. A great burning came into Mrs. David Chester's eyes, as, with a  sudden impulse of power, she threw the hand from the clematis and arose before her, saying,  "Mrs. Chester, do  you never dare molest a thing about this grave! I  warn you not ;o touch two things, all I possess in the world- ny husband's love, and my father's grave." "Get it out of here, then. This is my  land, on vhich you stand, and I tell you the place shall lot be desecrated with all these wild tangling hings." David Chester at the instant entered the in- losure, seeking his wife.              \  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7507-00000089"/> 174        FAYE MAR. "Look at that! See the work of your Indian wife; quite Sepoy-like, isn't it?" she exclaimed, holding up to her son's view the hand and wrist, where the imprint of Faye's fingers was only too visible. "Faye, did you do that?" and the son took the hand of his mother in his own with a tender taking of it, that went down deeper into the heart of his wife that his words had done. "Yes, David, I did it; tell me, does this plot of ground where my father lies, belong to Mrs. Chester?" "I believe it does, but I never thought of the fact in my life before, Faye." "David, will you send for a sexton?" "For what purpose?" "To remove my father. I can not let him lie in it another hour;" and the little figure that came forth from Storm-Cliff with such good intenr- tions, cast herself upon the grave, moaning and sobbing with all the heart-ache within her. I'I've touched her at last. I knew I should find the way," thought the woman of half a cen- tury of life, as she turned to go. "Mother, tell me what you have been doing or saying to grieve my wife, before you go?" "Ask her; she always tells the truth." Mrs. Chester was gone. The reason of Mrs.   FAYE MAR.        175 Chester's sudden departure was a sight of Miss Pall, not far distant. That young lady had approached sufficiently, to see Mrs. David Chester lying on the ground. She stretched her neck a little higher and said, "What is it; what is the matter? Shall I run to the house for camphor or something? Is she faint? "No, Miss Pall, do not distress yourself, it is nothing uncommon; what else can you expect from an ungoverned child?" "Oh dear, how bad!" exclaimed that lady; "how glad I am my mamma made me mind when I was a child." The gardener was met and sent in another direction by Mrs. Chester. He went, wondering, for he knew Mrs. David was down at the "Ground " waiting for him. There was a long silence, broken only by the deep heart-sobs of Mrs. David Chester, after the mother-in-law had gone from the burial-place of the Chester's, wherein Major Mar had been laid. At length Mr. Chester spoke. "Come, Faye, come home with me."  Only a sob for an answer. "Come, Faye, you have had enough of this for one day; will you come?" "This is the only home I have," came in a little, weak, quavering voice from above the grave, and  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7507-00000090"/> 176        FAYE MAR. then-a succession of gasps and sighs filled the in- terval, until he spoke yet again. "Faye, I am not well; I came to seek you; will you come with me?"  With the words, he stooped to give her assistance. It was scarcely needful, for in one moment she was standing beside him, with her tear-stained eyes looking up and asking, as plainly as eyes could ask, "David, what is it?" "I haven't been quite myself since that night, you know; it is a hot, scorching pain that goes over my head." "Come, and let me bathe it for you-I always used to sooth my father so; but you never have been ill, therefore I could not show my skill." "C Your opportunity is come." Miss Pall, looking out, saw the husband and wife return without a trace of the " scene" she had witnessed in part, and she was puzzled to comprehend how it could have been put away so readily. The wonder grew, when Mrs. David Chester presented herself at the dinner hour, and, without the slightest ceremony, sat a .moment at the table, and withdrew. She did not appear again that night, nor during Miss Pall's stay at Storm-Cliff, which came to an end as soon as it became evident that Mr. Chester could not accom- pany her to Boston.   FAYE MAR.        1" CHAPTER Xi. MRS. DAVID CHESTER FORMS A PLAN. Miss Pall, insignificant as a person, or as a power in herself, had yet acted as a repressive force upon Mrs. Chester, keeping that lady out of her son's apartments. In plain words, she had kept Mrs. Chester down to, a quiet, non-explosive temperature; but no sooner were Miss Pall's ears beyond hearing distance, than the sweep of stately robes disturbed the air-spaces along the halls and created a small tornado within the darkened room where her son lay, his head wrapped about in cooling remedies; he, trying to listen to the gentle voice that was creating word-pictures with won- drous power of tone and melody in them; and, al- though conscious of torturing pain, yet the pictures served to half hide and half master it. "Reading! and such trash, too, to a sick man! I more than half suspected what was going on; but since your guest was left on my hands, for the credit of the house, I was compelled to entertain  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7507-00000091"/> 178        FAYE MAR. her; now, I will give my attention to David. How is your head, my son?" "Better, thank you, mother, while Faye reads to me." "What did the doctor say?" "That he was not to be disturbed by business, or anything else," said the little wife, wearily clos- ing the book from which she had read.   5 "Do you mean to insinuate that I disturb him? Am I to be driven out of my son's sick-room by such a child as you?" "Mrs Chester, I never have found it necessary to 'insinuate' anything. I simply repeated what the doctor said." "Mother." groaned David Chester, "wili you let me rest?" "There it is; even you have turned against me -the last child I had left in the world. I knew just how 'twould be; your wife would come in be- tween us." And the woman began walking up and down the room with no very gentle tread, the rustle of her silken garments piercing in on the weary brain of the achinE head, and filing on his, nerves until he could bear it no longer. "Mother!" he cried, springing up, " if you have no proper feeling for me, I must request you to leave the room; I cannot endure the screeching of that silk you have on."   FAYE MAR.       . 179 "Getting cross, are you?  Its always a sign that one is better. I will report to-night, when the doctor comes, that you can bear the fine, squeaking voice of your wife by the hour, but your nerves are quite too tender to bear a word' from your mother. I will go, and if you are dying, you needn't send for me, for fear 'twould disturb you!" 'Mrs. David Chester touched her lips with her handkerchief, as the elder lady swept out of the room. Looking down at a streak of crimson stain- ing the cambric, a bit of a smile rested on her face at the thought that by that sign she had con- quered. ;'Faye, darling, come here.," She went to him, threading the swollen veins of his -forehead with the soothing,touch of her fingers for many mo-- ments, during which time neither spoke. Worn with the long pain, the man slept; and the loving little wife dared not cease the motion, lest he, missing it, should awake. Growing frightened at the long silence within- the room, Mrs. Chester, in the twilight, ventured to open the door. Mrs. David Chester arose ,and went out.   "He is sleeping," she said; "perhaps' you would be so kind as to sit here, while I go and take my tea?" Without waiting for an answer she went on, leaving Mrs. Chater to decide the point in her own!  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7507-00000092"/> 180       FAYE MAR. mind, and wondering at the change of manner that had come to her son's wife. It had so happened, that, sitting there in the dim quietness, watching the quivering of human flesh pierced by pain, the thought had come into Mrs. David Chester's mind to look at the condi- tions of life in Storm-Cliff, not alone from her point of view, but from Mrs. Chester's; and, all at once, this question seemed to be heard by her: "Supposing that your father had married Mrs. Chester, or any other person, and gradually won his time and thoughts, and that little every-day- sort-of-love that binds up the hours so gorgeously when life's great edition is brought out, would you not have felt something as this woman does? Think how lonely she is-her husband dead, her children gone, and the bright portion of her life ended." Thinking thus, a tender, pitiful feeling grew, until, all unconsciously, she had put it into words, believing that if she had been David Ches- ter's mother, she would have wished to watch be- side him. That night Mr. Chester grew delirious, and the village physician spent the night at Storm-Cliff. Mrs. David Chester chanced to hear the following words spoken, and they put to flight all the sweet feeling and sympathetic impulses she had taken down to tea with her a short time before. The *    FAYE MAR.        181 doctor had been in to see his patient, and, going below to give some directions to the man accom- pany him, encountered Mrs. Chester. "What have you been doing with my patient?" he asked. "When I left him this morning his pulse was quiet, and everything bid fair for speedy recovery." A little flutter of white along the hall above, and the wife waited to hear the medical opinion, her hand fast held above her beating heart. ' Doctor, it is his wife; you know she is young and thoughtless, and she has been reading to him; no one knows how long to-day." "I do not think that could have done it." "And then she is so quick-tempered; speaks right out on the slightest provocation. I dare say she has been arguing some point with him." "I ever found her the most tender and faithful of nurses with her father," he said, as if thinking over the past. Mrs. Chester winced under the large belt cyel of the doctor, as they, saying this, searched he- face, and she faltered: C But, you know, father, and husbands are' so different; besides, she wax always a spoiled child. Don't you think it would be well to forbid her the sick-room while the delirium lasts?" "We will look after that, madam; and in the 8 .  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7507-00000093"/> 182       FAYE MAR. meantime, do what we can to diminish its reign, lest the brain revenge itself by a fever." With a firm step Mrs. David Chester went back to her- husband's side, resolved that no force of mother-in-law or doctor should take her from thence, until reason came back. Was Mrs. Chester fearful that, in moments of insanity, long-past acts in her life might come forth from their hidden places to confront her, that she planned to have the wife removed? However, the doctor did not seem to second her- efforts very warmly, for he at once associated the wife with himself in his ministrations, and left Mrs. Chester little to do but to look on. At mid- night, reason was restored, and, at day-dawn, the doctor went his way-thankful that human skill- had again baffled the daring approach of serious illness, was he?-nay; for he knew full well how little human skill can do in such a case, but thankful that a Higher Power than any given unto him had battled with the demon, and sent it away, bruised and beaten. In some way the little lady, Mrs. Dent, whom she had met among the mountains in the summer gone, seemed to come very near Faye Chester on that day. Perhaps it was the thought of the many afflictions out of which she had come, and which, "' working together for her good," had so e .. er her good,"h  s   FAYE MAI.        183 concentrated joy, as to make it emanate from her life, and flow forth in sweet radiations upon all about her, that, in her gladness of heart at her husband's recovering, sent the sympathy of Mrs. Chester forth-to her. At mid-day the doctor came again to assure himself that all was going well, and sent Mrs. David Chester, first, to sleep; but, looking into her eyes, on her assertion of not being in the least inclined to sleep, and believing it, sent her out for a walk. She declined. He insisted; and stoutly setting down his cane, declared that if all Cliffton was taken down with whooping-cough, he would not stir from his chair until she had "taken the air." Mrs. Chester considered for a moment the feasi- bility of keeping the huge figure in the chair as a permanent investment, and deciding that it would not answer, she was forced out into the open air. Since her banishment was for an hour, at first the sea had its charms, all radiant in the giant flood of sunlight pouring in upon it; but the thought of the plants still exposed to the frosts led her on to the Chester burial-place. Her footsteps quick- ened, and her heart beat faster and faster, as she drew nigh, until it lay before her. "I will never forgive her, no never so long as I live," she cried, standing in the midst of the place. Mrs. Chester had occupied the time of her son's illness and his  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7507-00000094"/> 184       FAYE MAR. wife's attendance upon him in spoiling the work of the summer. Every vestige of the beautiful in outline and in idea was gone; every plant had been wrenched from the soil. Nothing but the bare outlines of graves, with the four evergreens keeping solemn darkness in their brooding branches over the graves of two children, buried more than a score of years before, remained within the en- closure. Tears of indignant anger came and went in quick succession down the face which had shone since day-dawn with gladness. "I can't be good. I can't live near that wo- man," she said aloud. She will make me as bad as she is; I feel at this moment almost as if I could kill her; I shall go away if she stays, even my husband can not keep me here;" and between dimming with tears and flashing with anger, Faye Chester's spirit was sorely tried during the hour for which the doctor had exiled her. Lest Mr. Chester should discover the unwonted glow she felt to be over her face, Mrs. Chester darkened the room after the doctor's going, and sat down with a bit of cambric in her hands, to make believe she was hemming it.  Presently, noticing that Mr. Chester was not inclined to sleep, the lady spoke. "David, you saved something for me out of my father's estate; where is it now, or is it used?"   FAYE MAR.       185 "Yes, Faye, to your first question; to your second, it is in a bank in Boston; and my second answers your third: now I put one, Why did you ask about the money?" "I was thinking whether or not it was my own." "It is put down as the property of Mrs. Faye Mar Chester, of Storm-Cliff, Cliffton." "Could I get it, if I wanted to?" "No one else could, without your order." "How much have I, David?" ' "What shall I do with you, child, if you grow into a business character? Pray do not, but bring me out of the safe a small book, that you will not fail to find with your name on the cover." The safe was built into a small alcove concealed from the library, and as M1rs. David Chester went down to it for the book, her mother-in-law watched, thinking in her. heart that the little woman was intent on gaining something more than legal allowance in the event of the death of her husband, for, to Mrs. Chester, the remnant saved from Majoi Mar's property was unknown. The book was found and given to Mr. Chestor "Let me estimate," he said; " this is the tenth day of November; you are this day owner of $37,- O00, and it is right that you should know this fact; but tell-me, my wife, do you wart for any-  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7507-00000095"/> 186       FAYE MAR. thing that I have not supplied, that you thought to ask?" "No, David, my wants I do not know, never having felt them, and a woman's wishes are always beyond the limit of money; but I wished to know if I had anything that was absolutely my own to use just as I liked." "Yes, child, that amount is beyond the power of any other person in your life-time, and as much more as you wish at your disposal for the asking." "C That seems a great sum to me; I never have used money except my school allowance, and that I always coaxed some one else to keep and spend for me." "I trust you do not contemplate giving this sum into any one's keeping?" "No, that is too precious; I can not forget that it was my father's. I am so glad I have it, David." "But is not all I have, thine?" "No, not in the same way, quite." "What are you going to do with the money, Faye?" "Nothing, just now; but, I will keep the book, if you are willing." "I am glad to have you keep it; and now I think of it, it will be well for you to have the care of its accumulation; the time may come when you will need the knowledge."   FAYE MAR.        187 Mrs. David Chester put the book away and sat a long time hemming the bit of ruffle and thinking of the future, with a sad foreboding of ill to come. It haunted her pillow that night, and followed her up and down through the days, until Mr. Chester was quite strong again.  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7507-00000096"/> 188       FAYE MAR. CHAPTER XII. A LITTLE WOMAN'S WORK OF LOVE. ONE day just before the coming of Thanksgiving in that year, David Chester and his wife went to the place which had been so sadly despoiled. They entered it without a word having been spoken. Mr. Chester gazed about with a vague, troubled look; then said, "Faye, who has done this?" "I did not see it done, David; but I think it is your mother's work." "My mother! What can have caused it?" "It is plain, David, your mother hates me. It is as I told you. We can not live together." "Do not be hasty, Faye. Let us learn whose work this is, before we condemn. Have you spoken to her about it?" u"No. It was too late, and you were too ill when I found it out. I have been waiting your recovery." Without saying anything more, and holding the hand of his wife very firmly within his own, Mr.   PAYE MAR.        189 Chester walked back to the house. Mrs. Chester had observed the direction in which the two went, and fully armed herself for the interview she knew must come.  She awaited their return in the family-room. Seeing her at the window, they went in; and without permitting Faye to with- draw her hand and run away, as she was more than half-inclined to do, Mr. Chester went close to the easy chair in which his mother sat, industri- ously fitting up a boy's suit of clothes for a chari- table institution. " Mother, was it by your order that Major Mar's burial-place has been despoiled of its beauty?" "I gave no orders." "Who did it?" CI did." " For what reason? ' "Because the ground is mine. There is the title-deed, if you doubt it; and who questions my right?" And she handed hin-Lthe conveyance to herself of the section of land covering the family burial-ground. ' I care not for. the deed. I care not whose is the land. But I question your right, by the law which you profess to obey, to touch so much as a leaf, that my wife has tended there. Is it 'doing as yofi would be done by?' " "It is my own, and I have the right to do just  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7507-00000097"/> 190       FtAYt MAR. as I like with it. I told her (with a rapid glance at Mrs. David) that I would not have the trash in the place. It looked much more like a Popish altar, than a decent Christian burying-ground. I can't see where she got all her heathen notions from. She will be turning us all out of house and home next." Before Mr. Chester could reply, the little hand that had been growing rigid with every word spoken, was withdrawn from his arm; and, going a step nearer, and looking down upon the stately woman who stitched away upon the garment for some unknown poor, she said: C"Mrs. Chester, the time has come when either you or I leave Storm- Cliff, for we can not dwell together in peace here. I can never forgive you for what you have done over there; not if I live a thousand years." "Who wants your forgiveness? when I come to you, confessing, then you may speak, but not be- fore." And, for a moment the cool, unfeeling eyes shone like cut-glass, through the gold-rim- med pebbles. "Mrs. Chester, do you seek a home elsewhere, or shall I?" "I am not going until my son sends me, and I don't think it like a Chester to send a mother out upon the world to live alone. Am I to go, David?" "No, mother. I can neither deny you a home,   FAYE MAR.        191 nor can I permit you to make my wife unhappy. I am bound by a solemn promise to my dying father to take care of you, and, by a promise equally binding, to protect my wife. Now, it passes -my comprehension, being a man, to un- derstand why you two can not live together in harmony, as I see other families living around us." ' "What do you know about other families, or how they live?" "s True, mother, but they live harmoniously be- fore the world." "Do not you? I trust that no son of mine will ever make his family affairs a matter of public mention." cs Mother, will you try to make Storm-Cliff a pleasant home?" "I would, if you had married a sensible woman; if you had taken a daughter of one of our well- established families. But what does that child know, who never has been taught how to behave to her elders, even? Tell me, David Chester, what right you had to bring such a wife home?" He - interrupted her. "Mother, you must be still. I will not hear such words spoken of my wife." "David, did I not tell you that we can not live together?" in a low, trembling voice, said his witc, her eyes filled with tears.  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7507-00000098"/> 192       FAYE MAR. "That comes of your evil marriage without your mother's sanction," cried Mrs. Chester, cast- ing down the charity work, and standing up be- fore the two, like a condemning judge. "I little, thought the day would come when my own son would tell me, in this very house, under this roof, where my word has always been law, what I must not say. You are not the same son since you were married, David," and, with a mingled glance of defiance and hatred at the trembling, weeping wife, who clung to the only strong arm that stood' between her and all the world, Mrs. Chester left the " two souls" together. The stronger seldom confesses to the weaker, but in that moment David Chester said, "Faye, was ever a man in such perplexity? Truly, it was an evil omen when the ruby went. I sometimes feel as if my manhood was being shaken out of me, and by two women; pitiful, isn't it? Faye, can't you help your husband to be stronger and better?" She looked up, with the oddest little bewilder- ment on every feature. C What! your little Eng- lish 'bungalow-bred' wife help you, a Chester! You astonish me beyond measure." "Help must come from somewhere, Faye, or I shall lose my senses." "I will tell you, David; you go down to Bos- ton for a few days, and I am quite certain every-   IAYE MAR.      . 193 thing will be brighter when you return; something tells me so." "Will you go with me, Faye? I can not leave you here. You might have a severer time than you think." "No; I can not go, indeed, David; there are many reasons: first, I am not in order for the trip; it is growing cold, and I have neglected to prepare for it. I shall be very industrious during your absence; and I am, as I said, quite certain that when you come back you will find the black cloud dispersed, and only brightness over your sky. You need the change. Do go, David," she added, pleadingly. "And is this the way in which you are going to help me?" "It is the only way in which I can, David, and you sought help of me. It was so funny to hear you, though it makes me love you more, thinking that I can really, at last, do something to help you. I will go this minute and look over your effects, to see that you go with all the 'order of going' of the Chesters." On the afternoon of the same day, Mr. Chester departed from Storm-Cliff. His wife went to the railway station with him, in her pony-carriage. She pleaded, as a reason for driving him down, that she had so much she wished to say to him, 9  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7507-00000099"/> 194        FAYE LAR. but on the way she was very silent, and at parting took only a second kiss, with misty eyes, which her husband, as the train was "cwhistling," did not see. Nlor did he notice as it passed on--he passing with it-that Mrs. David Chester was not on the homeward route, but, driving down the coast, toward the village. "He will know some day," thought the wife, "how much the D. D. means in my name. Oh! I do hope he will be the happier for what I mean to do." The pony stopped at the cabin of Martha Sing. Little Ailee Lee sat in the door, tying a wreath of autumn's latest flowers, mingling in with them woody-nightshade berries, when she espied the pony-carriage stopping at the gate. Down Went the flowers, and into the cabin went Ailee, crS- ing out: "O! Mrs. Sing, the prettiest lady that ever you saw, with hair just like sunshine on the sea, is coming to see you. Martha Sing looked ont. 4c Ailee, thatlady has been like an angel to my husband and. me;" and then Mrs. Chester was at the cabin entrance. After the first meeting with Martha Sing, a silence seemed to fall on Mrs. Chester. She hesi- tated to make known the object of coming. At length she asked, "Is your husband at home?" "I'm sorry he isn't, but he took the Dimple   FAtYE MAt L       i95 down to the island to bring away the things that belong to Ailee Lee. This is the little girl who saved me when I went out to sea, Mrs. Chester. Her father and mother are dead, and they've got a- new keeper for the light down there." Ailee looked timidly up into Mrs. Chester's beautiful eyes, and, finding them lit by love, she went nearer, and fearlessly kissed the lady, al- though she dared not listen to the sound of her own voice, and gave r'eply to the questions asked, in whispers, close to her ear. "I am sorry Mr. Sing is not at home to-day," said Mrs. Chester, "for I desired to have a little conver- sation with him and you; it is something very im- portant to me; something which can not be put off." "If it wouldn't be so dark when he comes home, we might walk up to the cliff and see you to-night." "O, no! not on any account; but, possibly, I might tell it all'to you." Martha Sing busied herself about something in a little room adjoining for a moment, re-appeared with a basket of turnips, and sent Ailee with it to a neighboring cabin, about a half-mile away. The child- went sorrowingly, and wondered on the way, if, by any means, her hair could be made to look like Mrs. Chester's. When she was gone,- Martha Sing drew a low chair near Mrs. Chester, and said: "Now, dear  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7507-00000100"/> 196       PAYfE IMA. lady, I hope it isn't any trouble that has fallen upon you, but the dear Lord knows that His troubles are not the troubles we think they are." "It is to help me out of a trouble that I am come, seeking you, because I have no one else. I am certain that you will help me, when I need it so much; but you must promise me one thing: that you will aid me without the knowledge of any other persons." "Proud and happy will Robert and Martha Sing be to help the daughter of him who has made our old days free from care." "I knew you would; but first, you must know what it is to be, that I want. I am going away from Storm-Cliff without the knowledge of any one in it." "O Mrs. Chester, don't tell me that." "You must not ask me why I go, for I can not tell you, except that I go because I think it right to do so. Now, what I want is this: to have your husband remove my father from the ground where he lies buried, without the removal being known. I am going to England, to have him laid beside my mother." "Mrs. Chester, are you crazy? do you think the thing could be done, unbeknown by any one?" "Why not? I have money to do it with.';   FAYE MAl.         197 "There is only one man who could carry out such a plan as that." "Who is he?" "I He saved your father's life on 'the Pinacle,' his name is the 'Man Isaac,' or, at least, no man knows more of him." "Can I -trust him?" "I do, next to my Robert. He is home to-day. I -will go and call him." Now, the enterprise that Mrs. Chester made known to Isaac pleased him. It held just enough of strategy and secrecy, without liability to law, to cause his entire entry into it.   t He promised to meet Mrs. Chester in Boston on the third day thereafter, with every thing in read- iness for the voyage, so far as his part of the plan was concerned, provided Robert Sing would co- operate, which his wife promised, by proxy. Re- membering the bank-book she held in .keeping, Mrs. David Chester provided for the necessary ex- penditure, and relying on the integrity of her three aids, she returned to Storm-Cliff. Mrs. Chester had shut herself up in her own rooms, ordering all things brought to her there, and would neither be seen by, nor speak to her daughter-in-law, during the two days following. No plan could have been more in unison with the wish of the little lady, who spent not one idle  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7507-00000101"/> 198       FAYE MAR. moment, but made every thing in readiness to leave. To her maid, Olive, she imparted, not to be told again, that she was going to Boston, and desired Olive to prepare herself to accompany her. Now, it had not come into the mind of this wife to disappear from human knowledge, and thereby cause her husband the agony of not knowing where she might be. The night be h iht fore leaving, at an hour when wearied ones were sleeping, she wrote the following letter: MY DARLING-Your wife is not wise. She is only loving. Therefore, if what I am about to do be not according to the dictates of human wisdom, it is according to the love of my heart in its utter- ance for you. Since the night you went out into the cold and the storm, and since I have seen you so ill, I have known that there was a warfare in your mind between your mother and me, and I have decided to help you, (even as you asked me) by going away from you and Storm-Cliff, that you and your mother may live in peace. It has been a wish of mine from the time of my father's death, that he might be beside my mother, and I have caused his body to be removed from Mrs. Chester's land, and it will go with me across the ocean. I hope my faithful Olive will accompany me, but, as yet, she knows not my going. The $37,000 which, according to your kindness, you have laid up for   FAYE MAR.       199 me, I shall take with me, as I know not what wants may meet my going. At first, you will miss me, but, after a little while, you will grow glad, and thank me far going; at least, I hope so. How I am changed since that time when I sat on the hearth-rug and saw you go out, never believing you could mean to leave me alone all night. I like you for being so kind and true to your mother, David. It gives me more faith in you, (if any thing could) for myself. You will say what you think best to people about my absence, only please do not let any one think I went because I did not love you. You will write to me, and, some time, we will meet again. I wish, for your sake, you had not found me that night on Storm- Cliff, nor gone up Mount Mansfield that sky-clear day, of which I love to think. Do you remember the stiff old confessional, where, with the great music of the organ rolling its volumes of sound into our souls, I knelt in the darkness, to confess my wicked love for you? So shall I confess by day and by night, until, some day, my true father confessor meets me; perhaps it will be in the same church, and confession meet confession. I may not linger longer in writing, lest self outgrow love. This letter I shall let sleep on your pillow by my side to-night, and, to-morrow, before I go, I shall put it into the safe, where I am sure none but you  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7507-00000102"/> 200       FAYE MAR. will ever find it, and, in finding, you will know one mite of the life of Your wife, FAYE MAR CHESTER, D. D. Storm-Cliff, Nov.--, 18-. The following morning the letter was put into the safe. Mrs. David Chester went to the door of Mrs. Chester's room and said, "I am come to bid you good-bye, Mrs. Chester." There came no reply, either to the words or the knocks that succeeded them, and Mrs. David Ches- ter went forth from the place God meant should be a home to her.   FAYE MAR.        201 CHAPTER XIII. THE EMBARKATION. ARRIVED in Boston, Mrs. David Chester found that Isaac had been faithful to his trust; and not only that, but, evidencing his* knowledge of the ways of the world, the man had taken the care to provide for all her wants, even to the engagement of a state-room in the steamship next to sail from that port for Europe. There was an unwonted color in Mrs. Chester's face, when she presented the bank-book, bearing her own name on the cover, to draw the sum placed to her credit. She was so unused to the ways of the business world, that she feared com- miting some egregious error. The man looked at the beautiful face, with confusion written all over it and mingling in with the peculiar light of her eyes, wonderingly. He felt that the applicant was no impostor, and yet the sum was too large to be drawn without certainty as to the individual. "Is this Mrs. Chester?" he asked. "I am Mrs. Chester." , o  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7507-00000103"/> 202        FAYE MAR. "You will pardon me, madam, if I ask identi- fication before giving you the money." "Please explain; I do not understand what you nlean." "Some person known to us-of course Mrs. Chester has many friends in the city; if she will ask one of them to come in with her, it will be quite right." Mrs. Chester felt at that instant, as if there was not a person or a name in the entire city known to her. She turned away perplexed, and, at the instant, discerned in the person passing, the figure of Miss Pall. She made haste to overtake her. "Miss Pall," she asked, " would you do me a little favor, just to go into Bank with me, and tell who I am. I want to use -some money, and they do not know me." The identity having been satisfactorily estab- lished, the sum was paid over from the bank. There was little left to do, except to make known the voyage to Olive. Instead of denial or resist- ance to her plan, which Mrs. Chester fully ex- pected she must deal with, she met from her maid the most joyful acquiescence in the proposed voyage. On the day following, the steamship sailed, and among the passengers the names of Mrs. David Chester and servant 'did not appear. Neither was   FAYE MAR.         203 their absence from the list by any knowledge of Mrs. Chester, but simply a precaution of Isaac's, who, in securing the state-room, had used his own name, which, unknown to any one as it was, com- pletely concealed their going.  So entirely had Isaac taken the little lady of Storm-Cliff, as .he delighted to call her, under his care, that at the proper time, without thought of her own, even her passport came into her hands. He arrived at the last moment to bid Mrs. Chester farewell, wishing her all prosperity on her voyage, and yet with a certain gladness in his air at her going that cast a shadow over the final moment, for she felt as if leaving all that was dear, without a soul to mourn her departure. The first night out, there was a heavy sea, the wind tearing across the wide, free waste, like a fire across a prairie. Mrs. Chester had gone to her state-room for the night, and Olive was sit- ting near by, when a little scream escaped the girl's lips, as a tall man stopped at her side. She thought she had seen a ghost; but' a second look told her that it was the human form of the fisher- man Isaac, only clad in habiliments unlike those of the fisherman. He bade her "be quiet," and " to come " with him " where he could speak with her." When they had found a convenient spot, he said, "Do not tell Mrs. Chester that I am here,  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7507-00000104"/> 204        FAYE MAB. unless there is an opportunity to serve her. I was afraid she would keep me from going, and a pretty' chance you two would stand of getting saved, if the ship should go up by fire, or down by a berg, or storm. If all is fair, she need never know that I came out, until we reach the other side; but, if there is any thing for me to do, go and ask for me at the captain's quarters." Without waiting for one word from Olive, the man disappeared, and for two or three days, the girl sometimes thought she must have fallen asleep and dreamed that he came, for there was not one glimpse of such an individual to be obtained about the ship, although she was always on the look-out for him.   FAYE MAR.       ' 205 CHAPTER XIV. THE SEARCH FOR GOLDEN FLEECE. AT this period of our story the United States of America was arrived at the close of the first year of the Great Rebellion. 'The stir and rustle of the-war had touched hearts and made homes solitary for those gone, in the- little fishing-town of Cliffton. Sometimes, nay, oftentimes, the soul of David Chester had been shaken with strong impulses to arise from his ease at Storm-Cliff, and go forth like a true knight, to leave home and wife, but he had striven to obey the call by influ- ence and money, not by personal encounter with the foe. On this visit to Boston, when the whole city rang with enthusiasm, and enlistments came as rapidly as feet to a fire, he caught the fever of patriotism and took it back, burning into his being, to Storm-Cliff. His arrival took place on the night following the day of his wife's departure. Hearing that she was gone, he thought-,-"She found, as I  said, my d. * . * go         . ..,.  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7507-00000105"/> 206        FAYE MAR. mother too strong to withstand, and has fled to me; I must go back to-morrow and meet her." Thus he thought, without one misgiving-without even marveling that he had not met her in that city; for she surely knew to find him at the Revere House. No sooner had it been told in Mrs. Chester's ears by Jane, that her son's wife was gone, than that woman, half understanding that the field was left to her victorious, went to the safe, and after an hour of hard labor, succeeded in opening it. Catchingi up the letter, laid conspicuously there, she read upon the envelope, 'C To be read only by my husband, David Chester, of Storm-Cliff"- "or his mother," she added, half aloud; and glanc- ing with her panther glance about the room to learn if she were alone, she broke the seal, and read it to the end. The letter was not returned to the safe, neither could her utmost endeavors succeed in relocking it. The library-door was not again opened, until Mr. Chester's return. He was left to believe that his wife had gone, leaving the safe open. What could he do, but believe the story his mother told? She tried her utmost to detain him from going the. day there- after for his wife; but one night in his home with- out her presence in it, was quite enough to expel him from the place.   FAYE MAR.         207 From the bank, where she obtained her money, Mr. Chester was able to trace his wife to the Tre- mont House. From thence, he lost all clue, and, believing she had returned home, he, with the war-fever raging in his veins, went to his home not to find her. His mother watched his agony all one night, with the letter from his wife, that would have told all he so agonized to know, rising and falling with the beat of her heart; and yet did not give it to ease his pian. Having heard of the death of the light- keeper at the island, and that Martha  Sing had the child in her house, Mrs. Chester went to the village and took the phild, by mere force of author- ity, to  Stormn-Cliff. She thought Ailee might serve to divert her son; but the handsome, stern man, with intense brown eyes, seemed to frighten Ailee, and the shy child fled from his sight. Even Mrs. Chester, with, her awful ways, seemed more human, than her son, to Ailee. Like all children brought up in solitude, and having no child to chatter with, Ailee Lee had a  habit of taking to herself, personating in her one voice two or three children. On  her escape from  the barren island, all the world was one mighty Eden to her, and every day of life she wandered  into some new corner that was fairer than all that had gone be- fore. Tiny leaves and bits of late vegetation had  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7507-00000106"/> 208        FATYE MAR. charms for her; and the gardens and conservatory of Storm-Cliff must have been, she thought, once lived in by Adam and Eve. As soon as she could make her escape from  the house, Ailee went in among the flowers of the conservatory, and sitting down behind a green cloud that floated there in the warm atmosphere, she began to talk to her- self. Mr. Chester, seeking in every corner of the grounds for some token of his wife's late presence, entered the conservatory unseen and unheard by the child. Attracted by her voice, he stood still and heard her say, "I wonder if 'twasn't Eve, or " maybe Eve died a great while ago, and 'was one of her sisters or nieces, or something. I wish she'd drive up to Mrs. Sing's gate again, and come in, with the sunshine all tangled over her head, and her eyes all full of sunset, shining so! 'Twas too bad Mrs. Sing sent me off, with the turnips. If-the basket hadn't been so heavy, I could have rin all- the way, and got back in time to hear what she was going to say; for I do want to know how such pretty ladies talk. There now, I guess, she's coming right in here: I am just going to shut my eyes, and make believe she is coming; and I won't stir, until she drives her pretty little carriage close up to me." 'What a living 9uriosity!" thought Mr. Ches- ..  .  .:.       .... :-  ? .:   FAYE MAR.          209 ter, peeping around the cloud-of-green at Ailee, who sat perfectly still, with sealed eyes, listening. L There, now! I think I hear her," softly whis- pered Ailee; "but maybe she wouldn't like to drive the pony in here, for fear he'd eat up the flowers; perhaps she will walk, and I never thought to look if she wore glass slippers; but I guess she did; and they'd make a noise like shells a-jing- ling;" and again she listened. There came to her no sound, save the rustling of the fig-tree boughs, under which she had sat down. Quickly the sealed eyes flew open, and up sprang Ailee, on beholding Mr. Chester close at her side. She was going to run away in great alarm; but he caught her. "Now, little girl, I wish to know what you have been talking about. Who is it you wish to see come in here?" "' It wasn't you, sir." He   smiled. "I am perfectly certain on that point, but it makes me more anxious to know about the beautiful lady, all gold, and sunshine, and glass; so you must tell me all about her." 5Mr. Chester spoke with such grave authority, that the child never dreamed to escape confession, and gave a history of the visit of Mrs. Chester, at Martha Sing's cabin;  " and, (sir, don't you think it was very funny, but I   heard Mr. Sing and that other man who  comes to his house, talking one  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7507-00000107"/> 210       FAYE MAR. night about somebody, and the other man said ' he was going to dig him up;' what did that mean? It was in the night, and I looked out the crack of the door close to my bed, and couldn't see any thing but a lantern, all dark on the sides only one, and then Mr. Sing went away with him." "Was that all, Ailee?" * Everything; but what did it mean, sir? I asked Mrs: Sing, and she said, ' little folks should be seen, not heard,' and that didn't make me know one bit more about it.'" "Ailee, you are a nice child to come and tell me, but I wouldn't think anything more about it, if I were you." "But can I never see the beautiful lady any more? She kissed me once, right there, on my cheek." "I hope you will, and maybe she will let you live with her some day." "That will be in heaven, wont't it, sir?" "Come to me, Ailee." The child timidly and slowly drew near him. Mr. Chester's lips touched Ailee's cheek. She cried out, "O, Mr. Chester, you have stolen the beautiful lady's kiss; I wanted to have it stay there always.' "Never mind, child, she will give you two, when you see her." Ailee did mind it very much; so   FAYE MAR.         2" much, that there were tear-drops on her clean white apron, when he, who had stolen her kiss, was over half the distance to the village. From Robert Sing's wife, Mr. Chester gleaned but a small amount of information, and returned to Storm-Cliff, declaring to Mrs. Chester his deter- rination to go forth and return no more, until his wife was found. "David, if you must go on such a wild chase, you may as well read that, I suppose;" and she gave him the much crumpled letter, that had been left so fresh and fair to -meet the eyes that now devoured its words. His mother stood by, watch- ing hifn as he read. A certain foreboding of ill crept like a palsy over Mrs. Chester when he folded the letter and said: "Mother, you know best why you kept the letter from me until too late; but no blessing will come upon you for the deed. I will never spend another day or night, save this one, beneath this roof, which you have made a place of torture to me, until you have won back my wife, or she comes back to it. I will do my duty and leave you to inhabit Storm-Cliff, but it must be alone." The lonely heart of the light-keeper's child cried at night for an accent of love. She wanted to go back to Martha Sing, but no one had come for her, She had been forgotten? and Mr. Chester  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7507-00000108"/> 212       FAYE MAR. nearly trod upon the little thing as he went out. He stooped and lifted her in his strong arms. "Bless you, Ailee," he whispered, "for loving the beautiful lady. Who knows but you may help me to find her." "Are you looking for her, too; won't that be nice?" because we can look together-I'm sure she is somewhere, but what do you want herfor?" "Because, Ailee, I love her." "Do you? Well, then, I will just love you, because you love her;" and Ailee's sweet lips cour- ageously gave him a kiss. Verily, there was much hope for David Chester, if the child could drop comfort into his heart, for none but those who might be angels can thus win the very purity of sympathy from a little child. Very few were the preparations David Chester made for leaving Storm-Cliff; very few the worldly possessions he carried thence. Every article of furniture his wife had selected, every dainty orna- ment, every picture that had been associated -with her, he caused to be removed to her apartments. The doors he locked with his own hands. All that he carried with him which had been hers, were sacred memories, and the slipper, still filled with sea-sands, that he had found, left by the tide. Mrs. Chester would have given all she possessed to recall the deeds she had done, on the night   fAYE MAR.        213 after her son's departure. The house was haunted to her for evermore with the presence of her long- suffering husband, whose loving heart and gener- ous life she had never rewarded as it deserved- with the shadowy forms of the fair daughters who had gone down to early graves. By the side of each one, an accusing angel seemed to be standing and pointing to her, as accessory to the deed of death, writing out, on the air, with the fine pen of memory, the youth unsympathized with, the early girlhood kept down by custom and stern rule to starvation-point, until no spirit had been left to battle with disease. Go where she would, the pic- ture of Faye Mar, lying on Margaret's bed in the Pearl-room on that night, went with her. Many times in the day, and in the broad sunshine, she put out her hands as if to brush away golden cob- webs from before her eyes; but they always took the form and hue of Mrs. David Chester's hair, as it shone between her and the sunlight on that day when she had the vine in her grasp, and Faye had cried out: "Mrs. Chester, you shall not " The cup of endurance seemed at the full, when, two days later, a letter from her son came, an- nouncing his departure for some unknown, war- stained place in the South. The knight had gone forth. It was a curious place in which to search for the "golden fleece," but he might find it even there,  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7507-00000109"/> 214        FAYE MAX. CHAPTER. XV. THE WILDERNESS SHE WANDERED INTO. DURING this time, the heart that beat under- neath the "Golden Fleece'-' was tempest-tossed by sea and by loneliness. When Faye Chester left the protection of her husband's home, she had not counted the cost. She went without thinking of herself; she went to lift the burden from his life, and, too late, found that she carried his grief in her own sorrow. It was the revelation of the weakness dwelling within her own heart that made her doubly desolate. Not until the pitiless leagues of ocean lay between the steamship and Storm-Cliff, did she comprehend how utterly dependent upon the love of mortal her life had been. Even the soulless passenger, who lay somewhere in the hidden recesses of the ship, seemed less alone, than his living daughter. At, length, the mood of Mrs. Chester alarmed Olive, and, in her anxiety, she sought counsel of Isaac. From that time until. the arrival of the   AYE MAt.        215 steamer at its destination, Mrs. Chester was care- fully kept in sight, either by Olive or Isaac. Once or twice Mrs. Chester observed that she was re- garded with attention by a tall, half-concealed figure, but she never suspected that Isaac was a passenger; and November storms coming across the ocean met them in its way, and the lady voya- gers appeared no more on deck, until the haven was reached. Whatever may have been Isaac's reason for re- maining unknown to Mrs. Chester, or even if he had a- reason for so doing, he never made known; but, even as he had taken upon himself the re- sponsibility of her departure, he took upon him- self the duty of making her very comfortable on English soil. The art (possessed by so few mor- tals) of making a woman unconscious that dis- agreeable details attended upon her daily comfort, was innate with this man. On the day of Miajor Mar's burial by the side of the wife he had so loved, Mrs. Chester could not go abroad. The very sky seemed shaken; the wings of the wind went beating up and-down from heaven to earth, as if in opposition to every intent of mortals; and a weary, forsaken feeling enveloped the spirit of the lady, who watched the hours come and go.

Life's joys seemed to have flown by, and swept the earth bare for her. Save for the one soul, who, with all the power of intense love, seemed beckoning her back to the western horizon, she felt no impulse,-life had no motive beyond the desire to be with him. She had learned out of her own experience that there was no place for her, except where he dwelt. Twelve hours on the ocean had taught her that. When Isaac came at night and said to her, with- out preface, "Now, Mrs. David Chester, are you ready to go home?" her very spirit sprang up into her eyes with thanksgiving, because one soul had believed her return possible. She did not reply. "If you will permit me, who have seen as much of life as most men, to advise you, I say, go home and outlive the mother-in-law, the happiest, best course left for you. Tell me if you are not tired of being out of hearing of that canny man's voice, who was so kind to you down at the Cliff, one -night?" Little Mrs. Chester convinced Isaac that she was well worth all the care he had taken of her, by putting her tiny hand in his, and saying "' with all my heart:" "There now, Mrs. Chester, I. knew what was   '      PFAYE MAR.       217 good for you, we'll just go back; tell me, shall we?" "I am ready." "Now that's what I call downright sensible, but you will have to content yourself a whole week here, for I don't like the looks of the steamer that goes out next; besides, I reckon there's a piece of work you'd rather do yourself, than have me. I mean something in marble or stone, to put up." Isaac watched Mrs. Chester for a moment, and then slowly put forth his hand, dropping upon the table close beside her, a tiny bit of'white paper. "-I thought maybe you'd like to have one like it, growing over here, to come and look at some time, so I just saved a few seeds; 'twas too late to make the vine live." "O Isaac,. bless you for this; I lIoked over every withered thing I could find for one seed. How did' you know they would please me?" "Did Mrs. Chester pull them up to displease you?" Without waiting for a reply, and knowing ho had trespassed on forbidden ground, the man withdrew, leaving Mrs. Chester to her own thoughts. It had been her purpose to seek the very few relations she had in England, and, look- ing forward to their protection had served to 10  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7507-00000111"/> 218        FAYE MAR. soften the harshness of her desolation on the voyage; but, once in England, a vague terror of meeting them, a certain inability to account satis- factorily for her husband's absence, took hold on her soul.  Afterward, when Isaac relieved her mind from all personal cares, and the desire for protection (inherent in every woman) found satis- faction, she became as solicitous to avoid, as she had been anxious to seek, those akin to her. The burial-place of the Mars was in a quiet vil- lagefrom whence all of the name had departed, save they who awaited there the resurrection morn.  Christmas, with its starry calls from over the Judean hills, its cables of green, binding, with flashes of love, on mirrors of ether, Heaven to Earth, its carols and yule-fires, came and went before Mrs, David Chester was able to turn her face to the West. No letter from her husband reached England. Mrs. Chester was on guard to secure the pages her son wrote the last night he spent at Storm-Cliff, divining their destination. The Postmaster at the village never thought of refusing the letters, already mailed, when Mrs. Chester entered early in the morning to receive them in person, saying that c she feared to send a servant lest by some mistake it might be too late,"   tAYt MAt.        219- Mrs. Chester best knew what became of the letter which the wife of her son waited and longed for, across a thousand leagues of water. Once upon the ocean, Mrs. David Chester could have passed the hours counting the billows through which the steamship urged its length, if, in count- ing, they could have been made less. No passen- ger could haye made greater heart-speed than did the little lady, who was often seen standing andlook- ing westward, until time itself was forgotten and only a reminder from Olive served to win her to consciousness of how long she had been watching, and giving the aid of her heart-throbs, to the huge engine, beating down below. And still, with the hope drawing near to glad fruition, the hope of being once more with her husband, there arose again and again the conscious- ness that even then happiness might not' abide with her. A vague unrest was growing with every hour into stronger toil of spirit, and Nature, with her voices from above and below, seemed crying into her ears, "There is no rest for you!" Isaac and Olive held many brief consultations concerning  the unsatisfactory state of the lady. The honest soul of the once fisherman was heavy within him, when he found  that when the land- signal brought smiles to others, none lit up the ; face of Mrs. David Chester. "What if I have  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7507-00000112"/> 220        FAYE MAR. made a mistake after all," he thought, CC foolish man, that I am; women are as uncertain as the sea; you never can calculate just right, whether it's on a calm or a storm; and just here, when by my reckoning, we ought to be near port, with wind and tide fair, comes up mighty uncertain weather; it's as bad as a fog on a ' Jersey coast'--I can't make it out." Nature proved kindly, and let the great ship beat peacefully into its berth, bringing every precious soul safe to land. Mrs. David Chester left her worldly cares to the custody of Isaac, and with Olive, went by the night train to Cliffton ; *.   FAYE MAR.        221 CH A PTER XVI. FLOWERS FOR THE PEARL-ROOM. As THE late dawn of mid-winter fought its way up through thick folds of darkness, Mrs. Chester began to count the familiar miles, while the train sped on, and with every one came new, swift thoughts revolving about her being. What if David Chester, her husband, should not forgive her having fled from his home, what if the old Chester pride, which grew more awful as she came nearer to it, should revolt at receiving back a runaway wife, (his love she never doubted, she had prom- ished not to do that), what, if he were gone, or, possibly, dead. The latter suggestion was more than she could endure in silence. Suddenly Olive was widely awake. Mrs. Chester had touched her. "Oh, Olive!" she said, "what if anything has befallen Mr. Chester, in my absence." "I am sure it's all right," said Olive, " for I just dreamed that Storm-Cliff was all afire, and that's always a good sign, and by the light of it  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7507-00000113"/> 222        rAYE MAB. the men were drawing in a great net, full of all kind of fish." "Olive, I am afraid to go back; what if I should not find him?" "You will, I am sure; please, Mrs. Chester, do not think about it. You are so white, it frightens me.)" The train made the station at Cliffton, just at sunrise. The station-master, (a man new to the place, the former one having " gone to the war") gave no especial heed to the two passengers who got down from the car, and immediately took their departure. "Shall I run down to the old place and order a carriage for you?" asked Olive, as the little lady was starting in an opposite direction. "No, Olive, pray come quietly with me, it is so early, and maybe no one will see or know us. Drop your veil, and we will walk toward Storm-Cliff." "It is too long a walk, Mrs. David; how I wish Isaac were here." Mrs. David did not seem to hear, but walked on rapidly toward her home; the shadow more and more darkening over her spirit, until a total eclipse came, and she, in some way, found herself looking as far down the road as her sight could reach, with a vague expectation of meeting a funeral train- winding along out from Storm-Cliff. Once or J   FAYE MAD.         223 twice she put her hand on Olive's shoulder as if for protection, but did not speak, until the high, white walls of Storm-Cliff came into view. The lady and her maid had wallked rapidly, scarcely feeling the cool, crisp air, full of northern frost, and, it being too late in the year for field laborers to be abroad, they approached the grounds with- out having been seen by any one. Storm-Cliff, with its large lonely rooms, and its mid-winter quiet, was a strange place for Ailee Lee, but the heart of unhappy Mrs. Chester, (if indeed she held one in possession) clung fast to the child, after her son's departure. Ailee, was the only human creature who did not seem to hold forth the accusing finger at her. The child's pe- culiar ways served to interest Mrs. Chester, and the stern woman was more nearly kind to the light- keeper's daughter than she had ever been to any other human being. One night Ailee was believed to be sleeping, and overheard, in a half -conscious state, the story, told by the servants to a new comer, of the beautiful young lady who had been found down on the Cliff in the night, and brought into the Pearl-room. The child listened most in- tently, for she had never ceased to search for the lady with sunshine tangled in her hair, and in list- ening, fell asleep. The following morning at day-  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7507-00000114"/> 224        FAYE MAR. light, she was begging flowers of the gardiner, and every morning from that time it had been one of her duties to put a few fresh flowers into the Pearl- room, as if in waiting for the expected occupant. It so chanced that Ailee was out on this errand, winding carefully in and out the narrow ways of the conservatory at the time Mrs. David Chester drew near. The child knew precisely what she might gather, and the world of green and flowers was yet too new for anything in it to be considered other than very beautiful. Mrs. Chester was not yet risen. The servants were at breakfast, and no one saw the two figures quietly treading the walks about Storm-Cliff. "Olive," whispered Mrs. David Chester, eager- ly catching her arm for support, "there's some person in the conservatory; pray inquire if all is well, the place seems deserted." "Come with me, then, dear lady, do! I can not leave you outside, you tremble so. See! it is no one but a child." The glass-door being opened, Ailee felt the current of cold air sweeping through and went to close it. The thick veil Mrs. David Ches- ter wore so concealed her features, standing be- tween Ailee and the morning sun, that the little girl could not see who it was, although the lady recognized her instantly. "Do you live here, my child?" she asked, stand-   FAYE MAR.         225 ing just inside, and surrounded by camellias scarcely more waxen than the face beneath the veil. '"I don't know, ma'am; I stay here because Mrs. Chester likes to have me. Mrs. Sing said I must, but I don't know where I am to live." "Where is Mrs. Chester?" "She doesn't wake up so early, but maybe she will, if I tell her you wish for her." "No, never mind now, I can wait; but you may tell me where Mr. Chester is." "He doesn't live here any more." "Where has he gone?" Ailee stepped a little nearer and whispered, ' I'll tell you, if you'll put your ear close down, so nobody won't hear." The ear being satisfactorily adjusted, Ailee whispered, u' Mrs. Chester tells folks he's gone to the war, but I don't believe it, 'cause he said. he'd help me to find the beautiful lady I'm looking after. Just see! I get flowers for her every morn- ing, and put 'em in her room awaiting, and I guess he's gone to bring her, 'cause he said he loved her."   - "Who is the beautiful lady?" "O, I hoped you'd know. She came down to Mrs. Sing's once, and I had to go right away to carry a basket of turnips, so I don't know."

"' O yes, and I know she thinks so, too, 'cause Mr. Monroe comes and tells her all the news about it a'most every day, all about regiments marching somewhere, and fighting somebody;--ain't you going to wait to see Mrs. Chester? I guess she'll wake up pretty quick." "No, my child, I can't stay; you are a good little girl, and I hope the lady will come some day to see you and the flowers." "Do you think she will?" eagerly questioned Ailee.       .  "I hope it, Ailee." C Let me kiss you for saying that, please, for it helps me a great deal, and there's nobody to look now, except me. Mrs. Chester can't see very well, and I'm trying to learn to read to her." Mrs. David Chester bent to kiss Ailee through the heavy veil, and, in so doing, a lock of the C golden fleece" got astray and came out. The child saw it, in an instant. She held scissors in her fingers, with which she had been clipping flowers. "Please, O lady, won't you let me have just a little bit of your hair ; it's almost like my beauti- ful lady's."   FAYE MAR.        227 Mrs. David Chester cut the fragment of a curl and put it into Ailee's hand. There were sounds of coming feet, and Ailee Lee saw no more of the two figures, than that they went down the carriage-drive, and on toward the great gate leading to the highway.  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7507-00000116"/> 228        FAYE MAR. CHAPTER XVII. WHY SHE ONCE WENT UP TO THE MOUNTAINS. VHEN David Chester went forth to do battle for home and the Right, he deemed that he was doing his duty. He could better wait--so he thought-his wife's return, on a distant field of action, than amid the daily duties of home, where every emotion stirring in his soul, would be fragrant with memories of her. The letter that he wrote, full of the tenderness which no other being, save his wife, knew dwelt within him, would surely find and win her home. The attempt to cross the ocean would doubtless result in their meeting on the opposite courses. There are always positions open and awaiting such men as David Chester. However merit may strive against misfortune, and striving, seem to fail, a man of assured position, who leaves ances- tral towers and acres to keep watch over his name, is certain to be awarded, by simple acclaim, the place that blood, and toil, and heroic deed fail to secure for him who would most prize it.   FAYE MAR.         229 "To command," was written on Mr. Chester's forehead, and his eyes held within their depths a power of control far stronger than his mother's, for in them was concentrated self-control, which in her's was totally wanting. Out of Boston went many regiments into our civil war, but not one of all the number surpassed that, in which, as private, was enrolled a name we have chosen to call David Chester. This is neither a war story, nor a story of the war, therefore I write not number or name, to tell when it marched, or who went with it into life and the glory of this world, or who lay down under its banners to rise not again; nor even do I mention the fields which it burnished with the fine gold of heroic deeds, nor the soil whose richness of blood sends up incense for evermore toward Heaven, tell- inog where the air sobbed with agony once- twice- thrice-nay, so many times that angels only have kept the reckoning. There may come a time in the countless ages we sum up into that incomprehensible word, Eternity, when we shall be able to count the sum of cries and tears, of hopes perished, promises broken, farewells denied, hearts riven, bodies perished, yea! even souls fallen short of Heaven, because of this war, whereof we glory, and grow great with pomp of banner, and pean of victory; but the time is not 1CP:;  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7507-00000117"/> 230        FAYE MAR. yet; not while the sun rises on fresh mornings and the seasons roll their fullness of life into our days. The National Debt will be paid. Of course, "it gnust be," saith every honest man; but doth man think, will God ever be paid for the souls that have been driven into Eternity in countless clouds, without His bidding? Of whom is this demand to be made? Little Mrs. Dent, whose name has once or twice crept into this story, was given of Heaven, Faith and Hope in so large degree, that when the civil war began she gave her only son to the country, and herself to ministrations of mercy, as noise- lessly as the rains and the snows fall downward. The tarletan of her widow's caps was yet in its first freshness, when the cry came for lint and jellies and woman's hands to give them. Crape and tarletan, bombazine and every sign of mourn- ing, Mrs. Dart put far away from her; " the poor souls saw black enough," she said, so she arrayed herself in clear fresh colors, and putting on her sweetest, brightest airs, this little lady, from out the old Commonwealth of Massachusetts, went down into the region of Death. She knew then, when the great call came, why the afflictions from out of which she once went up to the mountains for strength, had been sent upon her-to educate her spirit and to give her free4om for the work.   FAYE MAR.         231 she had gone forth to do. When Mrs. David Ches- ter sat down by yule-fires in England, Mrs. Dent watched the camp-fires that blazed on the first Christmas night of the war. When Mrs. Chester counted the billows of ocean, Mrs. Dent was count- ing waves of pain, as they rolled over torn and mangled men. David Chester would not accept an officer's posi- tion in his regiment. Possibly, had he thought of his wife at the moment, he might, but he thought only of the Chester honor, that must earn before it can wear, all jewels. He wrote dutiful, kind letters to his mother from the front, not of himself, his hopes, or his cares, but of her, her wants and wishes; and when the time came that he might look for his wife's return, he wrote to Mrs. David Chester, that letters might greet her arrival at Storm-Cliff. Ailee Lee delighted in keeping secrets, such as the advent of the lady into the conservatory. The mystery was greatly enhanced by the tiny circlet of hair that she had in keeping; and the child, with a daintiness of sentiment born of her island life, wrapped it in a fragment of white linen, and laid it at night beneath her pillow. Not many nights passed by before the idea came into the restless mind of the child to print a letter to Mr, Chester, and tell him all about it,.  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7507-00000118"/> 232        FAYE MAR. The task was accomplished through manifold efforts, and when the story had been told, it was illustrated with a few of the precious golden hairs, to prove that she had not been dreaming. Ailee waited many days before the opportunity came to go down to the village and entrust her great secret to Mrs. Sing. Mrs. Chester's hands were growing feeble. Many times she essayed to superscribe letters to her son, without making them quite legible. Ailee, playing at her feet, gathered up the refuse envelopes and asked why she threw them down. Being told, she never doubted but that one might carry her little letter safely, so she treasured it until the convenient time. Long marches were writing their severity on the faces of the men of David Chester's regiment, during the month of January, and when Ailee's letter came into camp, the fires lit up faces writh- ing with leaden pain. Mrs. Dent had come down into the place of suf- fering, and when she learned that letters were lying unread-home letters, that might work up from the last dregs of existence enough of energy to keep back the tide of Death awhile--she opened white, or yellow, or soiled messages, as the case might be, and let softly fall the contents into ears too dim to hear field-order, or the roar of artillery,   FAYE MAR.        233 but yet alert to tender home-sounds and words of love. Among the letters came Ailee Lee's to Mr. David Chester. Glancing over the names of the letters intrusted to her, Mrs. Dent paused at Ailee's-she had never known but one family of Chesters. The Chesters of Storm-Cliff were known far up and down the coast, but no one of them, she thought, would be a private, even in a Massachusetts regiment. The letter was not opened, for he, to whom it was addressed, lay not on the field, neither could he be found in all the camps when the battle-spoil had been gathered in. ^   &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7507-00000119"/> 234        FAYE MAR. CHAPTER XVIII. ON TO THE AGONY OF WAR. WHEN Mrs. David Chester turned away from Storm-Cliff, with Olive at her side, she had but one thought in going. Her husband was gone and she must find him. In vain were entreaties to "wait and not walk the distance again;" to break- fast underneath her husband's roof. "The trains would pass, as they used to 'do, at Cliffton, and the return train she must meet," said Mrs. David Chester, not heeding how the bright morning was vanishing into a cloudy, dark day, foreshadowed with storm. Long before Cliffton station came into sight, the snow began to fall, so that it was no marvel that the two figures, covered by the white concealment, were not known by the few villagers who lingered about the station. More weary and worn than she had been in all her life before, Mrs. Faye Chester saw the granite shaft on Bunker Hill come into view. It seemed a pillar of hope to her; and when she found her-   FATE MAR.         235 self in time to intercept Isaac, with her baggage, she was content to rest. In resting, visions of the past came, and the words that had been spoken years before behind the cairn of stones on Mount Mansfield, seemed spoken anew in the quiet room of the Revere House, where she lay with closed eyes and weary brain. To Mrs. Dent, the heart of Mrs. Chester went forth for help, and the resolve to seek her on the morrow, comforted the little woman into sleep. Whatever happened, nothing seemed to. daunt Isaac. At the time when he thought his volun- tary service ended, his aid was of the most Import. While the storm marched across the region, Isaac went forth into it, marching just as persistently up and down and through the windings of Boston streets, wherever there were the slightest indica- tions of military head-quarters, to learn, if possi- ble, whether Mr. Chester had joined a Massachu- setts regiment. The tall, intent man, glancing over thle'list of officers, was remembered-by many men that day, and the disappointed air with which he turned away told that he had searched in vain. Mrs. David Chester called at- the home of Mrs. Dent. As she waited in front of the beautiful portal, questioning in her own mind how best to bring herself to remembrance, the door opened, and she learned that Mrs. Dent was not at home.  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7507-00000120"/> 236        FAYE MAR. She sent in her card, to prepare the way for a sec- ond visit. "Mrs. Dent is not expected home until the war ends," was the message. "Has she gone to the war?" questioned Majo' Mar's daughter, the old military pulse of her father springing through her veins; "tell me where she can be found." A wisp of glory floated all that day before Major Mar's daughter. It would be so grand, so heroic, to go down 'mid blood and battles and great groans of dying men, to do deeds of mercy. Yes, it was just the place to be found in by her husband. It would win back his forgiveness, it would make him deem his little wife a noble wo- man, to be discovered in the performance of deeds, the very imagination of which made her feel the hero, even in the comfortable apartment where she tried her wings. A clue, the nearest that could be obtained to Mrs. Deni's wanderings, was laid fast hold of, the residue of funds deposited in the bank from whence they had been drawn, all the dainty fairy laces and silken  adornments packed away, and then Mrs. David-Chester deemed herself prepared to go down and minister to sol- diers in distress. The beautiful golden curls were drawn plainly back from her face; she hesitated to have them cut, which was her first intention,   FAYE MAR.         237 and the plain garments she ordered for the occa- sion, might have served to tell a sister of charity that she was dead to the world, but they were not at home about the person of Mrs. Faye Chester. So equipped, the trial came, but not before Isaac had discovered that their destination was not far from the locality in which Mr. Chester's regiment was last heard from. Olive held fast to Mrs. Chester, and would not be parted from her, although the lady used all her influence to prevent the girl from going. She was quite as obstinate and determined as the more sub- tle Isaac; therefore, as Mrs. Chester had been at- tende'd across the ocean, so was she attended into the turmoil of war. In the second year of waiting and longing for the latest intelligence from the front, Mrs. Chester sought Mrs. Dent, but there were delays many, and official passports to be obtained, and the ene- rmy's lines to be avoided, until the very spirit that went forth strong into the affray, was almost spent before the great .army corps was reached. Mrs. David Chester had learned many facts, both in her own experience and regarding the state of the country when at last she reached the military camp after a battle. A temporary hos- pital, with the rudest of wards, had been thrown up, and surgical skill was in full exercise, when a  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7507-00000121"/> 238        FAYE MAt. steward handed to Mrs. Dent a card, on which was written "Mrs. David Chester." A curious little etching on one corner denoted Storm-Cliff, but that Mrs. Dent was too busy to see, for she was doing her utmost to rally the forces of life in a wounded youth, to that point at which an opera- tion might be performed. Without an instant's hesitation, Mrs. Dent said: "Show the lady to me." The daughter of a hero--she who had come to do a service in just this place-shut her eyes as she wound slowly through the rows of hospital cots, lest the suffering should prove more than she could behold. A little, low ripple of laughter, such as one might hear coming from behind the shelter of cur- tains of damask in a happy home, made Mrs. Chester pause. On the further side of the cot close by, knelt Mrs. bent; the laugh had been hers; more potent than words, it acted like a charm on the rallying strength of her patient. Not stopping to turn her attention aside for a moment even from his face, Mrs. Dent held her unoccupied hand toward Mrs. Chester, not recog- nizing in the half glance she could spare, the Miss Mar of five years before. "I am come down to help you; please tell me what to do," quickly spoke the new nurse.   FAtYI MAR.       239 "Go anywhere, you will find enough to do, only don't give the men looks of pity; they pity them- selves too much. Cheer them   with thoughts of coming relief. I am glad you are here." Mrs. Faye Chester staid no longer than to won- der at Mrs. Dent.  Bright plaits of hair were wound about her head; the dress she wore was of a warm hue, almost ruby in its tint, and verily- yes, it was-a collar of Venetian lace about her throat. If Mrs. Dent could do service in such at- tire, why not she, who had gotten herself up as austerely as any convent ritual could demand. Isaac was at last in his true sphere. No more efficient nurse could have been found in all the land, than the strong man who gave of his strength to the wearied, worn and suffering. He well nigh forgot his mission, in assisting the surgeons to per- form their duties. It was near evening of the day following, when Mrs. Dent took the card of Mrs. Chester from her pocket and glanced it over. As she did so, she remembered the letter bearing the same address, whose owner was not within the camp, and she went to search for Mrs. Chester. Everything seemed to disappoint the new nurse. It was not what she expected, taking care of maimed and dying men. Besides, she had been a day -and more in camp, and her husband had not  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7507-00000122"/> 240        FAYE MAR. found her, as she hoped he would. Her hands were busy, it is true, for she would not permit them to cease from effort; but she was not too much occupied to forget for many minutes at a time, that more than three months were passed since she had looked upon the f:ace of David Chester. Weary eyes turned toward Mrs. Dent, as that lady appeared in the ward, and, even into those dim with the almost-come darkness of death, there came a brighter ray, resting upon her. She was going to join Mrs. Chester, when she turned aside to speak to a youth whose right arm and he had parted forever, only the night before. He was so young and so fair, and the very hue of his eyes and hair was so like her own soldier boy's, that the lady could not resist a word or two of love to him, hoping, as she breathed them, that some woman just as loving, might so minister to her Albert in like need. The youth looked up, and, seeing the face of Mrs. Dent, asked, "Why are you so kind to me? You do not know me." "I do know you through my own child, who is exposed to the same dangers that surround you; and more than all, are you not one of the ' little ones' whom Christ left to be cared for?" "Ah! Mrs. Dent, that is my great trouble. I did hope I was, but now all is darkness; it was so   FAYE MAR.          241 hard to come away and leave my arm lying on the table--the arm   that I meant to have done. such service with in the world." "My    poor friend, do you not know    that in losing your arm, you are called up to higher ser- vice. I have no doubt but that you will war more valiantly without your right arm    thain you could have done with it." "I wish I could believe it." Mrs. Dent leaned over the fair face of the youth and wiped the tears from his eyes. "Will you sing for me?" he whispered: "What shall I sing?" "Anything that you will. Sing a prayer for me. I can not pray." One by one the groans of suffering dropped into -silence, as Mrs. Dent, in a voice 'tremulous with petition, sang: - "My wants are as the sands unnumbered, 'With which all oceans' shores are cumbered ; And yet I ask not gold, nor glory, Nor life prolonged till hairs axe hoary; The gifts I crave, the wants I cherish, Are goods that ne'er with using perish. "I want thy mercy, O Jehovah!

"I want, for from my bosom gushing, A thousand wants are upward rushing; But one, 'tis large, 'tis all-embracing, The crown, the seal of every blessing; I want when soul and sense dibsever, To dwell with Thee, my God, forever."  As the words of the petition thrilled through the hospital ward, one soul yielded its mortal breath, and the pale, mangled form of a man was borne out that night to rest until the resurrec- tion. Mrs. David Chester found in the words Mrs. Dent sang, an expression for the toil of her spirit. The long unrest that came to her weeks before on the ocean, and would not leave her soul, had, at last, cried out in mortal tones. When Mrs. Dent went forward to the cot where Mrs. Chester sat, she could not see her face, it was hidden with weep- ing. "Courage! Mrs. Chester," whispered the loving lips of Mrs. Dent, and they passed on to drop words of cheer at the cot where a face lay, so pallid, that she knew the flush of life wouldrevisit it no more. "There's some one dead, over there," a voice spoke, quite near.  Mrs. Chester arose and went to the place. At the moment Mrs. Dent: was folding down the dead man's eyelids.    Hearts somewh7ere, would sigh for the light of the closed   PAYE XlA&amp;.         243 eyes. Mrs. Chester shuddered to think of any fingers pressing down the eyes of her husband, but it might be, even then, the death shadow was hovering over him. "Come away, this is too much for you," and Mrs. Dent. drew Mrs. Chester forth into the open air. "I am going for my daily walk; without it, I should soon get into the hospital, and I am certain the poor fellows would miss me a little. Tell me, Mrs. Chester, where have I seen you be- fore?" "'Do you not remember meeting Faye Afar, nearly six years ago,' among the mountains of Ver- mont?" "Indeed I do, and it is there, also, that I 'met the Chesters of Storm-Cliff. I was at a loss to remember, this terrible war seems to have put so many things out of memory.   But what has be- come of Miss Mar and   her father, to whom she was so devoted?" "Her father died soon after that time, and I am his daughter. I did so hope you would re- member me." "How could I, with your wealth of curls drawn tightly back, as if nature never made them'on pur- pose to be beautiful, and with a grave gray dress, as unlike the attire of the young girl I remember in Stowe, and on the mountain, as a fairy and  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7507-00000124"/> 244        FAYE MAR. Mother Superior. What induced you to prepare yourself in such style?" "I thought I must. You know at the North the opinion prevails, that only persons who have laid aside such follies as curls and laces, and have taken on a few wrinkles, are suited to the office of nurse; gray hairs are esteemed elegantly appro- priate. I thought at first of trying to persuade my yellow locks into white, but hadn't time to wait for the process to come on naturally. Mrs. Dent, indeed I am not so frivolous as I seem. I have truly lost heart for all those small personal adornments that pleased my father. Have you time to listen to my story? I want your counsel, I know so well the pure source from whence you draw advice." "We will walk to the river. I always permit myself a half-hour, and the pickets are sufficient guard at this time in the day." An almost mid-summer softness had crept into the afternoon. The south wind upbore from over the river spicy, balsamic. odors from forests of Southern pines that lay miles distant. The sun was drinking up red incense from a field to the north and westward. The garments of the God- dess of Liberty shall evermore be redolent of the red perfume that went up to Heaven that day. The wide, slow river went on its course with   FAYE MAR.        245 that silent, deep current of motion which seduces thought to bury itself in the same flow.  The two ladies came out upon its bank at a point where the foragers for wood had left, either through dull- ness of ax or forethought of protection of shadow, a clump of trees, old and gnarled, like. the trees of cherry on the coast near Storm-Cliff. a Now, my dear Mrs. Chester, our guard is sta- tioned across the river, I listen for the story." "Oh! Mrs. Dent, I am so miserable, so un- happy, and this thing that I thought would make me feel so good and great, only renders me smaller and more wicked in my own eyes than ever; and when I saw that poor white, pinched face lying on the cot in there, and you so gently closing the shrunken lids over it, I wanted to die too, because there seemed to be no more joy of all I used to know. Pity me, Mrs. Dent; I have lost my hus- band." "Oh! Mrs. Chester, I trust not; have you heard from him certainly?" and, on the instant, the letter in the trembling characters addressed to David Chester that she had been compelled to re- turn, was thought of. "I don't mean that he is dead-at least, I trust not; but I so hoped to find him down here. I think I have been very wrong, Mrs. Dent, but it was all his mother that made me so. She did not  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7507-00000125"/> 246       FAYE MAB. love me, and I never could live with a person, ex- cept from liking. It was in this way: Mr. Ches- ter wished his mother to reside at Storm-Cliff. I can not tell you what Mrs. Chester is like--not like any human being, I think-and so I said I would not live with her. She came, only to pay a visit, I believed, and one day she destroyed the place where my father lay buried. My husband had given to his father a promise to take care of his mother as long as she lived. I could not live with her, and I went away." "Went away from your husband's house! Did you not know that there was not no peace for a wife, except beneath her husband's roof, Mrs. Chester?" "Not then, for I thought I was doing him a great kindness; that he would live quietly then with his mother; but the very first night out on the ocean, I knew I had done wrong, and some way I have never been able to do right since." Mrs. Dent drew from Mrs. Chester every par- ticular concerning her trip to England, and the very motives that had induced her to coine to the aid of the suffering. The two ladies were resting close beside the river-bank, on seats of stone which had been placed there long before, when the camp- ground had been part of a private estate, and the   FAYE MAR.         247 river-brink thickly wooded. A fine, swift rushing of the cloven air, a sharp report, and a rifle-ball sped into the heart of the oak tree, against whose rough bark Mrs. Chester's head had found sup- port. In an instant, a return ball flashed out from a rifle not a hundred feet distant, and then Isaac was bending over Mrs. Chester. From the mingled emotions called up by the story she had told, and the sudden alarm of the shot, Mrs. Chester went into unconsciousness. In that state, Isaac, despite the' reiterated assurance of Mrs. Dent that Mrs. Chester was unharmed, caught the lady up and strode away at a pace or- dinary mortals could not attempt, toward the hos- pital, and delivered her into the hands of the gravest surgeon in the camp, before Mrs. Dent could come to the rescue. Olive rushed in, just in time to see the flushing color come back into Mrs. Chester's face, and Isaac was only content when he saw her walking about unharmed. Another mail came into camp that night-a mail from the great North, where, to the poor sol- diers, all things worth possessing seemed to lie. Amongst the letters, one for David Chester. It bore the postmark,   "Oliffton,---." The letter was given to his wife. Mrs. Dent had a certain power of her own, a despotism beyond that of  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7507-00000126"/> 248        FAYE MAR. military code, and a rule, fixed and unalterable as formula could make it, withered like frost under a vertical sunbeam, when she determined to do. Thus, by tacit consent, unclaimed letters, letters for ill and disabled men, letters for lost men, let- ters for dead men, passed under her inspection. The superscription of the letter for David Ches- ter, was not in his mother's writing. Trembling, almost as if doing a forbidden deed, Mrs. Chester broke the seal. Therein, she read as follows: STORM-CLIFF, FEBRUARY 1862. MY DEAR FRIEND, DAVID CHESTER: For a thing of less import I would not disturb the tran- quility of your devotion to your country. I was called to your mother last night, and found her in that peculiar mental and physical condition which invariably precedes startling changes. In her case, it may be one of several things, predominant among which, I deem it my duty to write- death. If such a thing as a furlough exists, get one, and come home. A stormy nature, such as Mrs. Ches- ter's, sometimes gives way under denials. Her present want is for you; her only comfort, in your massive home, the little girl from the island. The child seems to represent, at different moments, each one of the children I have seen borne out from Storm-Cliff in their early glory. If you do   FAYE MAR.        249 not come, I shall do my utmost to make her tran- quil. It was last night I saw Mrs. Chester. It is now daylight; I have not slept, and I am going up again. Your father's friend, and yours, PETER LION. DAVID CHESTER, ESQ. Mrs. Dent was hurrying by with her basket of apples of gold, as she called the buff envelopes, bearing them to the lips of waiting men, flush with sweetest heart-juices from home, when Mrs. Chester went along the narrow way, strewn with cots, just behind her. "Won't you read this?" she asked; "I am the lamest soldier in all the hospital. Tell me what to do. It is short. I'll read a letter to this hun- gry man, while you look at mine." Mrs. Dent read the letter. " What a grand, shaggy old doctor Doctor Lion must be. I should like to shake his paw, meta- phorically I mean. You will go, of course; a very angel's opening for you," said Mrs. Dent. "Go where?" "'Home to Storm-Cliff and your husband's mother; a much better place for you than down here.   My poor men want happy faces, with home-light shining in them; yours makes them  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7507-00000127"/> 250        FAYE MAR. dream of faces left behind, full of the sorrow of parting." "But my husband, Mrs. Dent? Is it right to go, uncertain of his fate; how can I? Besides," she added, "I should die at Storm-Cliff without him." ' I should advise your going, even if that seemed probable." "But, Mrs. Dent, you do not know my mother- in-law. I can have no influence over her." "Have you tried?" "No; I do not think I have. There seemed no hope of success. "My poor friend! You are, indeed, in need of help. Tell me what either you or any other per- son, brought up in the knowledge of the Gospel of our Lord and Saviodtr Jesus Christ, has to do with the hope of success? Did we make the world? Do we set the bounds round about the vineyard, select the vines and bid them bud and blossom and bear grapes, sweet or sour, as it may please us?" Alas! Mrs. Dent, I know nothing of. this knowl- edge of the Gospel. of which you speak, and out of which you act. I read the words; they pass away, and only the world, with all its crooked un- certain ways, in which I wander, remains. I am so tired of the world, and sometimes, much as my spirit yearns for my husband, I think that even   FAYE MAR.        251 he could not make me wholly content again. I want to lie down in some lonely place and die, I think, but when night comes and I might rest, then only happiness seems in action, and I feel that work is happiness." As she ceased to speak, the tears rolled down the cheeks, so round and fair, that Mrs. Dent's heart ached, as it had not done over dying men. She drew her away to a quiet corner apart. "My darling friend! Do you not know that God is leading you through a great wilderness? It seems dense and dark and full of weariness just now; but only obey and Canaan is close at hand." "Tell me what you mean; I am so dull." cC You are so worn with the conflict of wander- ing-with the heavy toil of your own spirit, that is all. You were not happy in your own home, and you went out from it. You did not try to meet Mrs. Chester with the love of your heart." 'How could I? I did not love her; I never can." "Listen! Why is it written to. 'Love your enemies?' You are determined that sour grapes shall grow where the Lord of the vineyard has planted vines of sweetness. He who made the law, also made the heart of man, and knew that the command could be obeyed. You could love Mrs. Chester."           -, :  "Tell me how?"  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7507-00000128"/> 252        FAYE MAR. "By comprehending her, by getting into sym- pathy with her life. I sometimes think, that if we knew men and women as well as the Deity knows them, it would be far easier to obey the law to 'love one another.' Go back to Storm- Cliff; spend your time in acts of kindness toward Mrs. Chester. Try to work in just that part of the vineyard the Master points out, without so much as looking up toward bud, blossom, or pur- pling cluster, and God in Christ will manifest him- self unto you. "I will! I will!" surged up to the lips of Mrs. David Chester, as she threw her arms around the neck of Mrs. Dent.  C I will go this very night, lest it be too late." Isaac and Olive were summoned. After the utmost remonstrance from Olive, she at last yielded to Mrs. Chester and remained with Mrs. Dent. For many reasons, Mrs. Chester knew that it was far better that she should return to Storm- Cliff alone. Isaac, with the material for martyrdom alight within him, had already taken the fearful duty of secret agent, that thereby he might penetrate the enemy's lines in search of Mr. Chester. When the lights of the camp-fires of the great army went down behind the horizon that night, and the eyes of Mrs. David Chester looked their   FAYE MAR.        253 last upon them, a sweet star shone out upon the future, luring her on toward her home. She knew that she had set her face steadfastly toward that part of the vineyard the Lord had appointed her to work in. As Mrs. Dent once went up to the mountains for strength, Mrs. Chester had gone down into the din and agony of war and found that wherewith she had turned homeward--stronger and truer for having gone. 1 1 ,  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7507-00000129"/> 254        FAYE MAR, CHAPTER XIX, THE MOTHER-IN-LAW BESTOWS HER FIRST KISS. I TRUST that it was forgiven Mrs. David Chester that she tarried full twenty hours in Boston, on her return to Storm-Cliff, in that there grew out of those hours, sundry boxes laden with comforts for the valiant sufferers. There went one for Mrs. Dent.  It contained many things of value, but none that would do more service to the eyes of sick men, than the bits of laces and ribbons, gotten up in the newest, daintiest styles. Mrs. Chester did not tell Mrs. Dent that they were brought from over the ocean to please the eyes of David Ches- ter. I doubt if the fact were recognized, as they were packed gently down, amid many mmore sterling gifts. Pure and white lay the untrodden snow over the road leading from Cliffton to Storm-Cliff, in the rosy twilight of the 1st of MSarch. All day the whiteness had been dissolving from the clouds, when suddenly, with that rare radiance that comed   FAYE MAR,         255 at sunset, the storm broke into fragments, melted into glory of color and air. Eastward, in massive lines of untouched grandeur, stretched the ocean; westward, against the wall of piled up clouds, rosy with radiance, the mountains stood, and nearer, almost as if there lay no atmosphere between, the limestone of Storm-Cliff towered above the sea. A stillness, as of peace, a repose, as of death, was round about the pure white walls of her hus- band's house, when the sleigh was drawn up beside the entrance. No open door, no face pressed with coming kisses against the window-pane to greet her; even a stranger to answer the summons. It was better thus, perhaps, She stood alone within the hall, doubtful which way to turn, when the woman who admitted her, opened the door into the room where the fearful words had been, spoken, which urged the wife to leave her home-within, it had a dreary, forlorn air, that told it was no longer inhabited by human breath and life. " Mrs. Chester doesn't- see any one, ma'am, shall I tell her you want to speak to her?" "No, I perceive that you do not know me; I am Mrs. David Chester, her son's wife. I will make myself comfortable. There is a child staying here, Ailee Lee; you may tell the child I wish for her, but not in Mrs. Chester's hearing."     ,  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7507-00000130"/> 256        FAYE MAR. Presently there camle the sounds of little feet tripping down the oaken stairs, along the hall, and stopping at the very door. The fire burned low, but Ailee saw Mrs. David Chester with the warm- ing light shining over her. She had taken off her hat and winter wrappings; and verily old habits have remarkable power, for she was kneeling on the hearth rug, when the sounds of Ailee's pres- ence drew near. "Come hither, little girl, I want some one to welcome me home, and to tell me about Mrs. Chester." "How glad I am! you've come! you've come!" Ailee repeated, dwelling on the words with linger- ing rapture, 'and isn't it funny that you are here just when I was not looking out for you. Dr. Lion made me believe that you'd come, drawn by ever so many reindeers-did you? I never saw a reindeer." "Nor I, Ailee, nor do I think Dr. Lion has, but why did you expect me?" "Mr. Chester told me you would come, and maybe let me live with you-that was before- he went away." "Tell me about Mrs. Chester." "I don't know about her to-day, she hasn't said much to me, but I have been waiting almost all day up there; I think she is sleepy."   FAYE MAR.        257 'C Who is with her?" "The woman who always stays up there." "Well, then, Ailee, I am hungry; I have eaten nothing since early morning." "Do you eat common things, bread, and meat, and oysters, just like other folks?" "Why, yes, child, how absurd; come close, I want to kiss you-what did you take me for, that you asked that?" ,c I thought maybe you would have to eat honey or something that the housekeeper couldn't get. She told me, when I first came, that my hair- wouldn't curl, unless I lived on molasses and honey; but I didn't like it." "Did you try?" "Just once, but it made me sick." "I would not try again, Ailee, for it is not true." "I am afraid they don't tell me true things about here. I am glad you have come. I'll run and tell the housekeeper you are hungry, and don't want honey or molasses." When Ailee returned, she found the room again empty. "Dear me! dear me!" she gasped, "What, if I have lost her again; how foolish it was to go all the way down-stairs." With noiseless steps, Mrs. David Chester stole  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7507-00000131"/> 258        -FAYE MAR. up the stairs and along the halls leading to Mrs. Chester's apartments. There was neither sound of life nor motion within them. They were de- serted, cold, and evidently like the room below, without occupants. Going back, she entered her own room. A wood fire was in the grate, and, sitting in an arm-chair, directly in front of it, the nurse, who, deeming Ailee returned, did not change her position. It was too late for retreat. Mrs. Chester had seen her daughter-in-law. That lady, surrounded by a barricade of pillows, sat upright in bed, her large black eyes wandering to and fro, as if in search of some hidden thing.  C Nurse! nurse!" she screamed, "take it away, take it away, it strangles me!"The nurse started up; her patient was beating the air painfully with her poor withered hands, evidently suffering from the illu- sion. Not all the patients in the hospital so hor- rified Mrs. David Chester, as the change in her mother-in-law. Her utmost resolution alone enabled her to ap- proach the wreck of what had been the stately lady of Storm-Cliff. "Mother," she said, taking, or attempting to take, one of the shrunken hands, "don't be alarmed, it is only your daughter, come to stay with you." "I never had any such daughter as you. My   FAYE MAR.        259 girls were all dark; you have hair that suffocates  me, like that English girl's, who stole the love of David from me." ' Mother, I am David's wife!" "David's wife! She never called me mother in her life; if she had, I might have been a better woman." "But she does now; listen, mother, I have come home to stay with you and be kind to you." a David's gone, I've sent for him, but he does not mind me any more. She stole him away from me, and I paid her-yes I got her father away from her, but she never knew it." "Oh, yes, mother, I knew it, but that was be- cause you didn't understand me; we are going to live happily now." "Will you give David back to me again, just as he was before you came, with your lithe ways, to steal his heart." "Mother, I've been down into the army to look for David, and I can not find him; he would come to you, I know, if he could." " Then you've lost him too; I am glad of that. Come here; I never kissed you, did I?" Poor prisoner! how flesh and blood shrank back from the burning, ghastly lips, put up, in the holy name of affection, to touch her own. Mrs. Chester imprinted her first kiss upon the  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7507-00000132"/> 260        FAYE MAR. face of her daughter-in-law, the nurse and Ailee being witnesses. "There, Mrs. Chester," cried Ailee, "this is my beautiful lady, and she has come without the reindeers; I went out to look in the snow, anl there wasn't a single thing but just anybody's horses'-track through the snow; please don't let her go away agrain." "Indeed, Ailee, I will not; you need not keep such a fast hold of my dress, I have no wings to fly with." "She may drop asleep and wake up quite her- self; I'd go now," whispered the nurse. In the vain hope of starting out anew, and of making all things bend to her purpose, after her son's departure, Mrs. Chester had dismissed the servants, who had almost been brought up within Storm-Cliff, and introduced strangers into their places. For awhile, the plan served, but new servants were more impatient than those trained to obey. The consequence befell, that, at the time illness came upon the head of the house, an ill-assorted, incompetent band of servants ruled below. Mrs. Faye Chester returned to her home, finding no part of it in order, beyond the rooms Mrs. Chester had taken a fancy to occupy.  Possibly, had the   FAYE MAR.         261 excitement of having them opened after Mr. Ches-, ter's departure been wanting, his mother would have been equally content with her own apart- ments. The disorder apparent through the house ex- tended to the table prepared for Mrs. David Ches- ter. It was wanting in all those nameless appoint- ments that tell of home comfort. Just here, on the threshold of the new life to which she had come, thinking to find at least order and the luxury of neatness, which had heretofore reigned beneath that roof, came cruel disappointment. Weary and hungry, the little woman sat down for the first time alone, in her husband's house. She did. not eat, for hunger was the only temptation. Dismissing the attendant, (new, like all the faces,' and brimming with eager curiosity) she taried to put back the crowd of surging emotions and drink the cup of, tea before her. The trial ended in tears, which silently rolled their way 'down her face, as, a half hour later, some one looked in, to remove the dishes. Turning quickly, to hide her face, she arose and went out. This coming home was very different from her imagination of it; it took so much com- fort out of life to have Olive gone. Since the year before her marriage, she had not, until then, been without that faithful attendant.  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7507-00000133"/> 262        iAYE MAt. In the dressing-room  opening out from  the Pearl-room, Ailee Lee lay fast asleep. The soft, regular breathing of the child, in her innocent re- pose, lulled Mrs. David Chester's pulses, tired with beating the irregular march of life, tired of going out into that terrible wilderness of the Im- agination, into the fearful land of prisons and star- vation, in search of him, for whose dear sake she had left her home but a few months ago. Before her were the satin-wood heights, with their pearl ornaments, of the bed on which, five years earlier, Faye Mar had been laid, on which Margaret, the pearl of the Chesters, had yielded to death. This Margaret, she thought, of whom David and his mother often spoke, would have been her sister, had she lived. A cabinet portrait of the young girl was suspended just above the grate. There was just enough dimness of light, else time had softened the features of the absent, to create a fancy of resemblance between the pic- tured face and David Chester, which had not be- fore appeared. Margaret's Bible, in its velvet and pearl binding, lay upon the bureau, just'where she had last laid it down.   FAYE MAR.        263 CHAPTER XX. ANOTHER NIGHT. AT mid-night, the nurse knocked softly upon the door. The knock found Mrs. David Chester standing, with Margaret's Bible open before her. "A change had come-was coming; would Mrs. Chester mind going in, just for a minute, while the servants should be called?" Deep, heavy, dulled breathing disturbed the air coming out from the room where Mrs. Chester lay. There was a solemn meaning in it; a certain power, that in all her life, with its intense pur- poses, she had not wielded, came borne on the sounds. The footsteps of the nurse died away along the distant corridor, where the servants slept. The daughter-in-law was alone with the mother. The fire-light flashed up, illuminating the features drawn with suffering. The feeble lips seemed striving to speak, but a paralytic numbness barred the accents. Sometimes, when a child is dying, a  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7507-00000134"/> 264        FAYE MAR. great fear seems to take possession of the spirit, a recoil from the dark abyss of death. The self- same fear was written on the face that the fire flashed over. "Mother, you are not well; let me rub your hands." The hands lay passively on the counter- pane, their work in life nearly ended; the hands, lined all over with the storms they had wrought in, when, without trembling, without dislike of any kind, only with a pitying sorrow, thinking with how much more of love Margaret might have done it, Faye Chester took one of the hands within her own. It was enough that it was not withdrawn, that the eyes, natural in their light just then, seemed to rest satisfied to have her standing there.                i It was near morning. Dr. Lion had been sum- moned, had come and gone. The nurse was doz- ing in her chair, the daughter-in-law alone watch- ing the face of her husband's mother, when a sound broke from the parted lips: CI have sinned!" What more might have been spoken was denied accent, and only a confused inward murmer told that she tried to utter words. "Yes, mother, we have all sinned, and fallen short of our high estate, but heaven is made ready for sinners," said Faye. The large eyes were fixed upon Faye, with such   FAYE MAR.      '  265 quivering want in them, that she brought the Bible which had been Margaret's, and laying it open before her, began to read the passages marked by Margaret's own hand. There were such as the soul longs to take with it into the unutterable re- alities of its new estate. Faye Chester thought the final hours of her husband's mother were com- ing very nigh. Everything that medical science could do to ward off paralysis, had been done, and yet it was, and had been, only a question of hours. Outside of the awful sternness of death itself, there was something inexpressibly pitiful in the fact of this woman, who had trod with assured- ness down all the avenues of life; who had been wife and mother, being left to die alone, with no drop of her own blood to be stirred in other veins, because her end was drawing near. Love she had not given. Love stood not, with abated breath and quivering eyelids, to watch each motion. When the voice that touched with new rever- ence the sacred promises, paused and died into silence for a moment, restlessness took possession of Mrs. Chester, and would not abate until the read- ing was resumed. Weary and worn with her vigil, at;day-dawn the watcher aroused the nurse and went out, The heavy voice of the woman-tried to e utter forth the words on the page to which she had i2  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7507-00000135"/> 266        FAYf MAAR been pointed, but the understanding was gone. The patient fell into a heavy sleep. Ailee was early awake; her first thought was of the beautiful lady. Peeping into the Pearl-room, the little girl saw Mrs. David Chester, but so white in her sleep, that the child ran terrified into the hall, shouting for some one to come. "Ailee! Ailee, child! Do not make such a noise,' said a pleasant voice a moment later, and the white sleeper appeared in the door. "You frightened *me so, I thought you were dead on the bed; I am so sorry I wakened you," repented Ailee. "Never mind, now that I am awake, I must go down to the village; would you like a ride, Ailee?" "With you? Oh, so much; I sha'n't be lonely any more, now that you have come." There was no power now in the person of Mrs. Chester to forbid the use of the carriage in which she would go no more out. In a dead kind ot stupor the leaden ears heard the sounds of going that came up from the carriage-gate, as Mrs Faye Chester and Ailee were driven rapidly toward the village. The face of Martha Sing shone for joy at the sight of Mrs. David Chester; she knew all the old servants, she was ready to see them, just as soon as she had done up her morning's work, and prom-   FA-E MARi.          267 ised to spend the coming night at Storm-Cliff, and to bring with her the folks that knew the ways of the house. After a report of the patient to Dr. Lion, and the securing of the baggage which had been left, for want of conveyance, at the station the night previous, they returned. And now began the long, patient waiting and watching, which should try the spirit of the new life upon -which the wife of David Chester had entered.

At twilight, old faces and familiar accents glanced into places to which they had been educated. Except for the uncertainty regarding Mr. Ches- ter, except for the deep pity for the suffering in- valid, (there must always be an "except" in every sentence of joy) Mrs. Faye Chester would have been happy. Even on this day, twice or thrice a note of praise escaped her lips. There was such intense comfort in feeling that she was in just that place God meant her to be. At night, she lay down to sleep, knowing that the fisherman's wife could do more efficient service in watching, than she. Before morning, the dreaded change had come. Mrs. Chester awoke from a heavy slumber, help- less. The words that she had spoken, I have sin, ned," were the last intelligible sounds that ever came from her lips.   FAYE MAK.        269 Nothing could exceed the' helpful- tenderness with which Faye surrounded the patient.    Un- spoken wants, wishes, that one less susceptible would never have fathomed, were satisfied. Cer- tain powers of .the mind remained in full force with Mrs. Chester. Memory was greatly impaired, and yet, in that inexplicable compound we call life,. the Past and the Present were strangely mingled, so that Ailee became to .Mrs. Chester a child who, many years before, at Ailee's age, had gone down: to the grave. Determined to fathom the mystery of the unsatisfied expression which lingered when- ever the name of Ailee was repeated in her pres- ence, Faye went over, in speaking to the child all the names that she had heard spoken in the family, until at last, when one day she said, "Lizzie, come to me," a smile, real and sweet in its naturalness, broke over the one-half of the poor face. From that time, Ailee became Lizzie in the presence of Mrs. Chester.  Going out one soft day in April, the mystery was solved: In her childhood, Mrs. Chester had a sister Lizzie, two years younger than herself. Her grave was found. She had died at the age of ten. Mrs. Dent wrote to Mrs. Chester letters full of brightness and hope; wrote them sometimes dimly traced in pencil on fragments of paper, by the side of suffering men; but they ever came into  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7507-00000137"/> 270        FAYE MAR.

CHAPTER XXII. OUT AND IN WITH THE TIDE. JUNE came, with wealth of green, with roses and strawherries. Again the boats of the fisherman went and came out and in on the great blue high- way. Storm-Cliff glistened white above the sea, and the walls of David Chester's home glanced back the whiteness, like a color echo from the old main-land. There had been little improvement in Mrs Chester. Her chief comforts were to cling with child-like tenacity to Faye, and, in pleasant days, to be drawn out upon the balcony overlooking the Cliff and the sea. Faye read to her, watched over her, anticipated the slightest want, and never left her during the day, except when she slept. And Ailee Lee grew into a merry, loving child, even in the grim presence of the paralytic woman. The love and smile of Mrs. David Chester was happi- ness enough for the child, in that time of her life. But changes were even then drawing nigh. One   FAYE MAR.        273 came in the following manner: There were so few visitors, and none to come in at any time in the day, except Dr. Lion and Mr. Monroe, that a cer- tain freedom reigned through the mansion, such as only comes with long illness. The day was perfect, the very sky telling out its blue with a vivid sense of rapture, and earth, redolent of all sweet perfumes, answering back through throat of birds and tint of flowers. Mrs. Chester was drawn upon   the balcony. Faye, dressed in white, looked almost the child again, as she sat at her mother's feet reading aloud to her. Ailee, not knowing how else to evince her love, had,*while the lady read, stealthily stolen out the pins from her hair until, at once, a shower of gold fell down in a mass of ringlets over the white dress. Turning to chide, with a smile, the little hair-undresser, there stood Martha Sing with a dish of strawherries, spoon well poised upon the top. Faye dropped the book and took the berries. The picture any artist eye might have reveled in; Faye, in her white robe, overspread with that molten glory of hair, kneeling before Mrs. Chester, so stately, and yet so helpless, and putting straw- berries into her mouth; the little girl with bated breath watching every, one, lest it should come short of its destination; and, in the rear, looking through the open window, with the calm light of  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7507-00000139"/> 274        FAYE MAR. age shining over every feature, the good face of Martha Sing. It was the one expectant hour of the day, time for the mail to come in, and yet Faye Chester did not turn to look down the long road villageward, she only fed Mrs. Chester with strawherries. A berry fell, and Faye had been so careful! Ailee sprang forward to pick it up from where it had rolled, leaving a crimson track on the white breadth it had traveled over. If ever doubts had existed of the paralytic's consciousness, in that instant they vanished from Faye's mind as she looked upon the face before her. Mrs. Chester's eyes were gazing with an in- tentness not to be misunderstood into the grounds below. A look of joy overspread her face. She made great effort to articulate. Martha Sing and Faye Chester leaned over the balcony, but no cause for the emotion was in sight, although the view was carefully scanned. "Go down, Ailee, and see if any one comes," whispered Mrs. David Chester. The invalid signified weariness; she would go in, and, although not the time when she slept, she yet closed her eyes to be left alone, but still with that new happiness in her face that made the little woman pause and look upon it more than once, as she went forth to take her walk.   FAYE MAR.        275 s Ailee! Ailee!" called the voice, to which the child ever listened gladly. She bounded out from an opening in the hemlock hedge bordering one side the drive, at the instant she heard the call. ;; Ailee, dear, shall we treat ourselves to a run down to the sea; we've been good children to-day, haven't we?"  -               ' "I wouldn't, Mrs. Chester, 'cause some one's coming, I guess, to see yott." The words had but escaped the eager lips, when from the same opening emerged Isaac. How awkwardly he advanced, as if half ashamed of being seen. "Well, Mrs. Chester, you see, I've come." "O Isaac, what news?" "I thought you wouldn't be glad to see me without him, but I had to come." "' I am glad to see you, but do tell me, have you learned nothing, absolutely nothing?" "Yes, Mrs. Chester, I saw him." "When? Where? Do not keep me in suspense, when I've waited so long." Ailee was standing just behind the lady in white, dancing a very minute dance, and peering through a broken bit of place in the hedge. "Mrs. Chester, what if he is lame." "That is nothing." "What if he turned from his country?"  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7507-00000140"/> 276        FAYE MAR. "He is a Chester, and could not; but why try me so, it is cruel." "Mrs. Chester, what if I have brought him back? "Then I will bless you forever and ever." A crackling behind the hedge, a step on the gravel, a color, like much-worn army blue, inter- mingled suddenly with a volume of white, and David Chester was half-carrying his wife in under the portal-I wrote half-carrying, intentionally. An empty sleeve pointed down toward the path- way of strawherry stain on the dress of his wife, as they went in. "They don't want us, Ailee," cried Isaac, catch- ing her with the dance yet in her feet into his arms, and hiding in a vined summer-house; the man sobbed and wept, half with joy, half to think that there was no one on the earth to look, for his sake, as the little lady of Storm-Cliff had done, for David Chester's. "I wouldn't cry," suggested Ailee, after she had gotten into breathing space again, "I want to go and see what they are doing--what's the mattel with his coat sleeves?" "There wasn't any arm in it." "Why not?" "It was frozen one night, and they were obliged to cut it off."   FAYE MAR.        2" "I hope the sharks will get 'em," was the form of justice that escaped Ailee's lips. "O my darling," said David Chester, at the portal, "'I have been creeping around the house an hour and more, like a foolish man, afraid to come, afraid of startling you too much; how is my mother?  I saw Martha Sing on the balcony." "David, have you seen Mrs. Dent?" "We have seen no one; to this man, Isaac, I owe my life; he found me in a southern prison. We have not rested a single moment on the jour- ney here." David! David! can you bear it? Your mother can not speak to you-she will never speak again -but she must have had a vision of you from the balcony." During this time, David Chester and his wife had been traversing the hall, the staircase, and the distance to the room where his mother waited. There was no need for Faye to glide in and say, "Mother, do not be startled, David is come home." The widely-open eyes betrayed their knowledge, and as once again in mute greeting the son bent to imprint a kiss on the face, amid whose wrinkles the angels of patience and love were writing new lines, to be interpreted, we trust, in heaven, tears rolled out from the eyes that, since childhood's hour, had forgotten to weep. Faye gently wiped 12*'  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7507-00000141"/> 278       FAYE MAR. them, then .touched the wrinkles with her lips, and turned with full reconciliation to David Ches- ter, whispering: "David, I was wrong; I might have lived with your mother, but I knew not the way." "And, poor child, you married a man to igno- rant to lead you." "That you might both be led of Him who alone is perfect light and knowledge," said the simply solemn voice of Martha Sing, whose presence had been utterly forgotten. In the silence that followed, the husband and wife went out, Faye striving to keep from their mother's sight the empty sleeve. And still she did not seem to see that it was empty, hiding the quick contractions of her heart deep down, that he might not discover how much it hurt her. For a moment David Chester lost his wife. She was standing outside, holding both of Isaac's hands tightly in her own, and a rapid torrent of gratitude was ebbing from her lips towards the savior of her husband's life. When she had ended, Isaac said, looking simply- down, as if half ashamed of the asking, "What if, Mrs. Chester, I reward you by taking Olive into my keeping?" "Olive is a treasure; if she were mine I would bestow her upon you.. Cheerfully I resign all   FAYE MAR.        279 claims, if you can but win her. Come in; in my joy I forgot the hunger of my guests." David Chester never knew the lonely, desolate, winter coming-home of his wife to Storm-Cliff. He had come from out the privations of a pris- oner's fate to his home-in the June of the year, to find all things prepared for his comfort. He took his seat at the table. He was served. There could be concealment no longer. With a quick, impatient gesture, his wife bade the servant go, then sprang up from her seat and knelt beside his plate, to cut the meat thereon. "David, David, darling, I am almost glad; you will always need me now." The words began bravely, but the fork and knife fell upon the table, and the wife sobbed out her sorrow on the shoul- der, from whence no living arm could spring to enfold her. "At length she looked up. "Forgive me, it is all over now; you know it must come some time," and suddenly, with one of her ever-varying moods, she-broke into a little laugh, so like Faye Mar, that David Chester started in surprise. "What were you thinking of, Faye?" "Why, Martha-Sing has a way of counting up blessings. She says we forget to do that, and .so let the sum of troubles accumulate, when we might just as well keep the weights well down,  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7507-00000142"/> 280        FAYE MAR. with blessings on the scale. I think she is right, for I was just thinking that I was thankful you couldn't live without a head, for it would have been so dreadful to see you coming back in that way. Wouldn't it be a horror for evermore, to think of a human being alive and headless! why, it's nothing to lose an arm. See! I shall soon learn to serve you. Is that cut nicely?" And, smiling as serenely as if a Chester of Storm-Cliff- had not lost his right arm, the wife of that Ches- ter went back to her place. Ailee peeped in.  "You may come, child," said Mrs. Chester. ' I just wanted to know if I am to go home with Mrs. Sing, now he has come," said Ailee, the dance yet lingering in her feet. A quick recognition of purpose passed from the two souls, and then David Chester spoke. "Ailee, with whom do you wish to live?" "With the beautiful lady we found, sir." "Come to me." The child stood at his plate, looking timidly across at Mrs. Chester. Before that month had flown the light-keeper's little daughter was formally adopted into the family of the Chesters of Storm Cliff. The invalid was more restless that night. Faye staid until past midnight, and every time   FAYE MAR.       281 she turned to go, the eyes would look so entreat- ingly toward the door, that it seemed almost wrong to go at all. "David, are you asleep?" was softly breathed in the Pearl-room, near morning. "No, Faye, what is it?" "Did you bring any baggage home with you?" "Absolutely nothing, but that bundle on the bureau." She opened it. Within lay the sand-clogged slipper, that had been out and in with the tide. "David, did you love me well enough to carry that about with you?" ' Yes, Faye, I will never be parted from it. The enemy took it from me once, but a Southern  officer chanced to be passing, and glanced at it." '0, a sentiment, is it?' he said. 'Well, let the poor fellow have it, it will save meal perhaps."' "Well, could you live on it?" "I had little else." During this time the wife had been playing with the sand, pushing her fingers into it up to the toe of the slipper, when, with a little scream of pain, she suddenly withdrew it. Mr. Chester started at the cry. "What is it Faye?" "Something stung me, I believe. They have horrid, biting things down there, don't they?" and  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7507-00000143"/> 282        FAYE MAR. she emptied the sand to find the insect. A- red gleam shot out of the pile. She caught it up, running to the bed with the glee of a child; " 0 David, it is the ruby you lost that night." "I would rather have found that thin to have my right arm again," he said, and she was too happy for speech, when he kissed the drop of blood from the finger that had found the ruby. In the autumn of that year the great change came to Mrs. Chester. What she might have been, if permited to live and take her place in life again, no minortal may judge. She was a strange, cold, hard woman, but I think at the last she went into heaven, knowing only the alphabet of the Great Language which there binds all hearts into one, the language of Love. Martha Sing is gliding down the vale, confident that in the valley, or on the resplendent Heights beyond, she shall find the baby who passed through the dark water-gate so long ago. There is to be a marriage soon at Storm-Cliff. Even now the notes of preparation are sounding, for the war is past and gone. Isaac and Olive are to be the chief actors, and Ailee is dancing with joy to be. that wonderful thing, a bridesmaid, which has been promised her. They tried to give Mrs. Dent an ovation, in Boston, when she came home from the war, but   FAYE MAR.        283 the ambitious army-nurse would not accept it. She is awaiting the higher honors; the accord of the "Well done, good and faithful servant," is the music for which she is waiting. One day in the winter- following Mrs. Chester's death, Faye, at her husband's request, was over- looking papers which had belonged to his mother. She had had them brought down into the library, and was throwing, as she examined, refuse papers on the coals, when, with a startled glance, she looked up at her husband. He, reading, did not notice the look. She buried the papers she held in her bosom, and went out. The paper was that letter which David Chester had written to her and himself mailed, before leaving Storm-Cliff. The seal had never been broken. With a trembling hand, like one receiving a message from the dead, she opened and read that passionate ap- peal for her return. She wept over the pathos of it; she gladdened at the love of it; she knelt to pray for strength to forgive the dead woman who had denied her her heart's heritage. Then, all the nobleness of her sweet nature broke forth in the words, ' He shall never know this thing that his mother hath done."  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7507-00000144"/> 284       FAYE MAR. CHAPTER XXIII. THE MAN ISAAC. ISAAc and Olive, the war being ended, were to be married in the month of May, and if, at times, a doubt arose in the mind of David Chester regard- ing the former life of the man, a look into his honest face, and a memory of the deadly perils from which he had been rescued by him, silenced the doubt, so that it never put itself into words. And Olive! In her trusting soul, there was no room for suspicion, from the moment she dis- covered that it was not a vision, but Isaac, who appeared to her on the steamship when they were outward bound. He was a hero, quite above doubt or suspicion of any kind, in her mental horizon; so that when, but two days before the time appointed for the ceremony, he asked her to walk with him in the moonlight on the beach, and in that walk, without explaining why- he went or where, told her that she must trust him and wait a little longer, for he had a work to do, and it might   FAYE MAR.        285 be mid-summer when he saw her again; even then, she trusted him entirely. The morning after the walk had been taken, Isaac was gone; and Olive explained to Mrs. Ches- ter that the marriage was not to be in the month of May. Ailee, the small bridesmaid, was in greater affliction at the disappointment than was the bride; while, for the first time, the question, C Who is this man Isaac? and ought Olive to be- come his wife without knowledge of his former life?" was put into words. Isaac was well known in the village; not a man, woman, or boy belong- ing to the fishing interests of the town, but what knew him to be unequaled in courage, skill and honor; and yet, when the evidence was in and the summing up came, the real knowledge was met by a barrier, across which only imagination had space to go. The barrier was this: Five years earlier than the night on which he had gone out on the ocean with Robert and Martha Sing to search the Pinnacle Rock, he had appeared one day among the fishermen at the beginning of the mackerel- fishing season, and, although laughed at as a landsman by them in his first endeavors, he yet, by his forceful will and undaunted courage, by his manly self-dependence and persistent effort, won the good-will, of the men of the coast, and the fish to his bait, until, at the end of the season, there  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7507-00000145"/> 286        FAYE MAR. was no one man among them all who could man.. age a boat, or lure the fish to his line, as could he. During the five years, no one had heard him speak of an event in his life beyond those that had como to him in Cliffton. It was as if his existence then and there had beginning; so that when Olive told the simple story of the walk on the beach, and the works he had there spoken, to Mrs. Chester, and that lady repeated them to David Chester, he went straight-way into the village, to learn if possible some new thing of him. There was nothing to be told, save that he had said- to Robert Sing that he was going away for a time, and that the rude cabin he had occupied previous to his departure with Mrs. Chester for England, had been given to the wife of one who had gone out on a summer's morning upon the great deep, to come no more in from it at call of wife or children. The time of roses and strawherries came and went-the heats of midsummer were over the land. Olive looked now and then at the simple treasures of her bridal attire with a sigh that was but half expressed, lest there might be treason in it, and ended the survey with the wonder in her heart when the time would come wherein she should need to wear them. The days went on, and wistful looks from Olive as the hours came when it was time for the daily   VAYE MAA.        28 mails to arrive, touched sacred memories in th6e heart of Mrs. Faye Chester, restoring to her, with vivid reality, the days wherein she had longed and waited in like manner. Mrs. Chester planned th1 times for her drives and rides in such manner that she was seldom a moment too late to receive the contents of the box belonging to Storm-Cliff, and then no temptation could suffice to win her home by a circuitous route; or, if Olive came to her morning duties with a face a little whiter than usual, or spoke with a quiver in her voice, the pallor and the tremulousness were quite certain to procure for her a seat in the carriage, that not a moment of waiting might be hers, beyond that which was necessary; and yet, of all this watching and waiting, not one word was spoken. July was growing into his eldest days, when- there came a time of exceeding industry on the farm lands. The hay crop was absorbing all the labor of the place. Mr. Chester had gone out in the early morning to superintend the spreading of the hay, and at mail-time was not returned. Olive was in Mrs. Chester's room sewing. She had taken her position where she could look down the avenue toward the highway. The morning was very warm, the air sultry, and along the horizon floated the thin, white clouds that foretell the coming thunder- storm.  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7507-00000146"/> 288        FAYE MAR.  Mrs. Chester lay upon a lounge reading. Gradu- ally the book fell lower and lower, the eyelids closed: she was sleeping. It was not a new pic- ture. Olive had seen it many times during her years of service, and yet this morning she stayed her sewing to look at the lovely face, with the golden glory of hair resting on the pure white of the pillow; it had never /been to Olive quite so perfect in its beauty as then, and the girl won- dered in her quaint way how Mrs. Chester would look when she was grown old and the sunshine had paled to moonlight in her hair. The lady slept, and the maid went on with her sewing and her thoughts, until a little clock striking the hour for mid-day made Mrs. Chester start out from sleep, and Olive turn quickly to hide the tears that she, unconsciously to herself, had let fall. Too late! they had been seen; but one looking in a moment later, would not have thought there was sorrow of any kind in that apartment. Mrs. Chester ordered the carriage, but there was no one to execute the order; not a man could be found about the premises; every one had gone to the distant fields to hurry in the hay before the shower should have time to gather. For a moment Mrs. Chester stood still in dismay at the information, and then she asked, "Olive, can you help me to put the saddle on c Ripple?' "   FAYE MAR.        289 "Oh, Mrs. Chester, pray. don't," urged Olive. "You ought to say, 'Pray do,' when I have slept until noonday. I am going to ride over the fields and see the haymakers; that is, if we know how to make Ripple ready." With many a misgiving, Olive made fast the trapping on the pony because of whose fantastic, dancing motions his mistress had given the name Ripple; and Ailee came out from the summer- house--the same into which Isaac had carried her captive on the day of David Chester's return-to watch the departure; it was such an unusual thing for Mrs. Chester to ride away, alone, from Storm-Cliff. The day was one of great heat-so great that even the breeze from the ocean, that ought to have glided inland from the face of the rising tide, seemed stayed somewhere on its course; the land was so still, pressed down, as it were, by the flood of sun-glare that poured everywhere. Ripple went on his way toward the village as if he, too, had been sleeping and was only half awake. There were two roads leading from Storm- Ciiff to Cliffton; one, the inland carriage-road, the other to the beach and thence onward across the sands by the road the fishermen were accustomed to take to the sea. The distance to- and from Storm-Cliff, by the one or the other, was nearly a   &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7507-00000147"/> 290        FAYE MAR. the same, so that when Mrs. Chester found among the letters on that day, one for her husband, from some little out-of-the-way town in a Southern State, that she surmised might contain news from Isaac, (she had become used to looking for intelli- gence from every letter whose writing was un- known) she resolved to take the letters by the sea- shore road, and thence upward to the hay-fields. Upon the sands the tide was higher than she had thought to find it. At first she stopped and looked up the beach toward Storm-Cliff, that glistened whitely in the hot sunshine; but Ripple glanced backward and pawed impatiently to put his feet forward into the waters. The day was too hot to go back, and Mrs. Chester, with a low whisper that none but Ripple could have heard, told him to go onward. There was nothing formidable to cross, only bits of water that wandered in and out with the coast- line, but, at the then stage of the tide, there was no one on the shore. The little lady of S torm- Cliff was, with Ripple, the only living object up or down the coast. She rode fearlessly onward, thinking of the time when she had first climbed the rock before her to watch and wait; but even while she looked, the rock seemed to vanish, and she could think only of cool, large-branching shade-trees. She thought of them on the glaring   fAYE MAR.         29i beach on that July day, much as Martha Sing had thought of the well, with its refreshing water, on the day when she was floating outward in the Dim- ple. The sand was so white in the sun, the water rippled and rolled its broken lines under Ripple's feet, until she was quite bewildered. Had she seen what lay in her pathway she would have tightened the bridle that hung so loosely over the neck of the horse: it was only a " horse-shoe," traveling its accustomed pathway in seach of food; and having crawled into shallow water, it was making effort to get back again. Perhaps Ripple's thoughts were as far away as his mistress's; the crawling fish came so suddenly before him that he made a sudden leap into the air, and then went dashing through the water at his highest speed. Mrs. Chester was thrown into the tide.   The water was not deep enough to drown; the fall was not violent or far enough to seriously injure the lady; but sun and heat and fall combined were quite sufficient to carry forward the slight indis- position that had demanded the morning sleep, into a delirious headache.  The fall into the water sent the blood with a- rush over brain and face. She had only strength to get into a safe place, out of the reach of the tide, before uncon- sciousness came. She fell back upon the white sand, with her hat shading her face, and lay there.  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7507-00000148"/> 292        FAYE MAl. Olive was on the watch for Mrs. Chester's re- turn. Nothing moving in them direction of the house could escape her clear, keen vision, for an inward sense of approaching news had been hers that day. She saw Ripple galloping up the road from the sea without his mistress. Her cries aroused the house, and a minute after, the house- maids were moving in the direction where the hay- makers were. They met the homeward-coming carts, laden with hay. Carts and hay and oxen blocked the road. When, a few minutes later, David Chester drove after them, the men were half-way to Storm-Cliff. It was Ailee who gave him the news. She had kept on to meet him. "Papa, come!" she cried; "mamma went to the village for the letters, and I guess she come home the shore-road, for Ripple came that way." "Without her, Ailee?" "Yes, sir, and the men have all run down there." Mr. Chester had learned this while Ailee had climbed in by his side, and then the horses were driven at their utmost speed to the beach. No- thinc could be seen from thence but water and sand; water and sand everywhere, with the sedge- grass creeping down close to the waste of sand. Mr. Chester had passed the men in their way,   FAY  MARB.       293 They came to the place to find him standing and looking the distance over, for some trace of his wife. "Tell us, Mr. David," said one, what we must do, where we shall look to find her." At the instant there came a call, so loud, so clear, that it sounded seemingly out from the sky. Every eye turned toward Storm-Cliff. On its crest' stood Olive. She waved signals down the beach, indicating that they should search there. From her high out-look, she could discern some- thing far down the sands, that she knew must be Mrs. Chester. When Olive had come down from the cliff, there was not a soul in sight. The distance to the house had never seemed so long as when, through the great heat, she hastened to make all things ready -for what, she knew not. Dr. Lion was called to Storm-Cliff that day, and for many days he watched his patient through the long, slow tedium of fever. No persons were per- mitted to see Mrs. Chester, except her husband and Olive. As time went on, there came an hour near to day-dawn, following a night in which, with a heavy heart, David Chester had watched his wife. The silence of the room was broken by the words,  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7507-00000149"/> 294        FAYE  IAR. C Was it from Isaac?"Olive heard the sound of the voice and stood at her side. "What is it, Faye?" David Chester's words trembled with the dawn of hope in his soul, as he bent to listen. She spoke again, asking: "Was the letter I had, from Isaac?" "Letter! We never thought of letters, Faye; we only thought of you. You must have lost them." A little interval of consciousness, and then Mrs. Chester fell asleep. The light was just coming in, when Olive car- ried to Mr. Chester a package of letters that she had found in the pocket of the dress Mrs. Chester had worn. They were yet damp and crumpled. Mr. Chester left the room. It was a glad morn- ing, full of summer's brightest airs and sweetest graces; the sun was rising out of the sea as David Chester stepped upon the balcony from which he had caught the first home-coming glimpse of his wife and mother. Ailee chanced to be early up on that particular morning. She broke the seals and gave the letters to her father, saying, "They look as badly as mine, that I wrote when you were gone to the war." It chanced that the first letter Ailee gave to him was that one which had come from the small, out-   FAYE MAR.        295 of-the-way place in the South. He spoke soon, saying, "Ailee dear, come and listen! There is news from Isaac here." c0, papa! quick, I can't wait." He turned to see if Olive were in hearing-then read the letter. It was a half-impulsive, half-re- pressed document, the purport of which way, that a man had reached a house- in the far South, had there been taken ill, and was slowly recovering: he had made the request that David Chester, of Storm-Cliff, might be informed of his illness. The letter ended with the'sentence, "The man is large enough and Christian enough to have two names, but the only one he gives me for you is Isaac. When you write, I am interested in learn- ing his real name. He will be cared for here, until recovery has taken place." It was three weeks since the letter had been written; -for a large portion of that time it had lain within the pocket whence Olive had taken it. Isaac might be even then on his way Northward; nevertheless Mr. Chester wrote by the early mail the same morning, that not a moment be lost; he wrote, requesting that Isaac might receive every possible attention and: care, and, having so written, could only await a reply., The letter which had been received and the re- ply written by David Chester, were given to Olive,  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7507-00000150"/> 296        FAYE MAR. The new brightness that had overspread the girl's honest face when she returned the letters, told its own story. Even illness was as nothing compared to possible unfaithfulness, the agony of which had come near entering into her soul. Olive took another look at her laid-away treas- ures that day, and the look gave her comfort. Mrs. Chester's recovery was slow and tiresome, like the illness that had caused a journey from In- dia to England. Before it was effected a second letter had been received, containing news from Isaac, given by his own hand. He made the time of his return later than Olive had expected, but said not one word of the object of his absence, nor why he did not return immediately upon his recovery. It was September when Mrs. Chester went abroad again. The tenth of the month Isaac was to be at home. He came at the appointed time. Mr. Chester had determined to ask of Isaac what his life had been to the time of his appearance in Cliffton; but when the man came again among them, with all his old strength of manner and hon- esty of soul beaming through his face, that deter- mination lost firmness, and vanished forever while listening to ISAAC'S STORY. It was told on the night of his arrival-to Mr. and Mrs. Chester, to Ailee and to Olive--in these words:   FAYE MAR.        297 "I don't think the Lord ever lets a man go all the way in this world starving him nigh to death for the very things he wants most. I know he sometimes lets him go a long, lonesome part of the way, without a home, with everything and every- body he loves best failing him, disappointing him, deceiving him." (Isaac's voice dropped down to a hoarse whisper, but he suddenly started out from the silence and went on). "It's been better since I came to Cliffton. God must have inclined the hearts of the men and the women down there to believe in me. I thank Him for it. Some of you remember the night I went in the boat with Robert Sing and saved a life, for the life saved was part of your life. After that night, a kind of a voice that I've got a habit of listening to, and that some folks don't seem to hear, kept speaking to me, and saying, just as clear as the stars shine, 'Follow that family; you're wanted there.' u My heart gave a mighty bound when Robert Sing cameto me and asked if I would help him, one night. After that I was sure the voice was right, so I, kept on and followed most things it told me to do. "There's one thing I don't understand yet, and that is why it told me to go to Storm-Cliff in mid- winter weather, when Mrs. Chester left the camp." "You didn't, Isaac," interrupted Ailee. "Maim-  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7507-00000151"/> 298       FAYE MAR. ma came all alone. I remember all about that night." Mrs. Chester's look confirmed Ailee's words, but gradually faded, as Isaac went on to say, "I never missed a train, or lost sight of your wife, Mr. Chester, until I saw her safe under your roof; then I set out-with a thunder down in my heart, that I wonder everybody else didn't hear, it made such a noise-to find you. "The United States Government gave me serv- ice to do. I think sometimes now. of the great danger it was, but then I only thought of the deeper work I had to do; and that kept under- lying the other all the way, and cropping up to the surface, until I thought maybe it showed out as bright and clear as Storm-Cliff in the mornings when we went out fishing at daybreak; and then I wondered that everybody didn't see it and cry me out for the traitor that I was. "One night I was put through the ' lines' and left a wanderer, with not another soul to know who I was, or where or what going for. If any man is tired of his life and wants to commit' sui- cide, let him first try the life of a spy. "I'd been pretty much all around the ' States,' knew the ways of the country, and had learned, when only a boy, something of the engraver's art. It was an awful black night when I passed the enemies' line. The wind was blowing a big sea-   FATYE MAR.        299 gale, I kept stopping and putting my hands be- hind my ears to listen. I was in a piece of woods, but somehow I heard the breakers come thunder- ing in the air, and kept looking back to see the foam, though I reckoned the ocean was twenty miles or more to the eastward. Well; the rain began to fall, and I was moving on pretty brisk, when I saw a sudden light about a hundred feet ahead, I knew in a second 'twasn't gas, nor the will-o'-the-wisp either ; in two, seconds I heard the twin brother of .that light cracking through the pines'; 'twas lucky for me that 'twas a piney region, for down came the sentry right on my path ; but I managed to step out of it up a tree that stood in just the right place. Somehow I kept on thinking, as I hid away in the thickest part, -that God made that tree just in that place for me, Isaac, to climb, and the thinking so gave me courage. I always looked back to that tree as a good omen, and, if I'm ever rich enough, I mean to buy it, dead or alive if it can be found. I'd like it to stand where I can see it,' when my belief in particular provi- dences gets blinded by the dust sin keeps throwing up into the air God meant to have so bright and clear we- could always see Him in it. "I staid up there maybe two hours, as near as I could reckon; there wasn't anything but the beat- ing of my heart to go by; you remember 'twas too  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7507-00000152"/> 300       FAYE MAR. stormy to get a glimpse of the sky. Well, when I began to think of staying up in that tree until the next night, (for unless I could get away before light there was no other chance) began to think of the danger of falling asleep in all that time, through weariness and the suffering from hunger, I was ready for 'most any chance. The storm kept on, and by-and-by there came another rifle-shot, but this time 'twas off to the right a quarter of a mile, I reckoned. I knew that was my opportunity; so I climbed down and turned a right angle to about half the distance, (for I knew the picket-guard would have his attention that way) then stole on through the woods as fast as I could go. It seemed as if the gale got up seven-fold strength ; the old cones rattled down from the trees like great hail- stones ; and though I knew just as well that any step I took might bring me up against a soldier, on I went, until the day began to break. I was then fully past the picket-line and in the enemy's country. Years before, in a Southern town, I had known a man for whom I had a hundred times been taken, and the fancy took me to go and find out where this man was. I kept on, takling care to keep at a good distance from the camp, and came nigh the town just as the day was done. I went into a little shop by the roadside for some- thing to eat. I had not broken my fast since I left   FAYE MAR.        301 the Union lines. I got in there, and had half eaten my loaf of bread, when the shopkeeper (he had been a Northern boy) looked up and said: "'Harkee, stranger; how do I know you've got any chink to give me for that there loaf you're eating?" ' Sure enough! with all my caution I'd got into that region with no money but that with some of Uncle Sam's face on it. "'Well, stranger, I haven't, 'I replied, without the least hesitation; but maybe there's some bit of work you've got to be done, that would settle for this loaf.' ' What are you good for?" "' I can farm it a little.' That sentence nearly cost me discovery. The man remembered suddenly the hills of his boyhood. 'Theydon't 'farm it' down here,' he said; 'I reckon you're from the North.' "So I was a year or two ago ; had an old uncle up in New England, that was going to die. He sent for me, and didn't die ; but his not dying kept me pretty busy on the farm for a time, till he got about again ; and, you see, up there, "farming it" means doing a little of 'most anything; includes shop-keeping, and preaching, and soldiering, too.' "' Well, can you preach?' said he; 'for if you can, you'd better begin at it at once; we're a wretched set of sinners down this way.' 13'  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7507-00000153"/> 302       FATE MAR, "All at once there came into my mind some- thing that happened when I was a youngster.' One day I had been what folks call a bad boy. So when I came up for punishment, my grandmother gave me the worst one she knew. 'Isaac,' said she, 'you must learn a sermon by heart, before next Sunday comes, or you can't go to the general muster next month.' I got the sermon into my head, and there it had lain all the years until that night, when the text--the kind of key-note, you know-came to me. So I said I'd preach to pay for my loaf. As soon as a sugar-barrel was put upon the side-walk, a crowd began to gather, think- ing to hear something. new from the army. I mounted the barrel, and announced my text- 'Through thee will we push down our enemies; through thy name will we tread them under, that rise up against us.' '"It was a grand old sermon, that had been thundered forth by one of the Puritan divines in the darkest days of the-war of the Revolution, and was suited to -the hot temper of the South. My heart beat pretty loud with the fear that the ser- mon would escape my mind. Love of the general muster in my boyhood did me service; the sermon was ready, every word of it, and come out in due order. The men cheered the terrible denunciations, and the women shed tears, whether of delight at   FAYE MAR,        303- the discomfiture that was to hurl down their enemies, or of sorrow at the picture, lest it be turned against them, I could not judge. By the time I got through, the street, as far as my voice 'could reach, was crowded. There ran right, along through my mind, as I was repeating the words, side by side with them, the thought of the old man, seeing, in vision while he wrote, me, stand- ing on -the head of a sugar-barrel, delivering the hard, flinty sermon that he had worked out of his hard life; the people cheering denunciations against his people, incited to fierce endeavor by the words of his own wrath; and. all the while, there sat the picture of my good old grandmother, sitting and knitting, whilst the naughty boy Isaac was taking in his punishment. "cc Well, stranger!' said one, 'why ain't you got the appointment in the army as chaplain? That kind of stuff 'ud do more good than the weak things half of them feed the men on; why, I feel more'n half like joining the army now, and I know it's nothing else but that.' "' Well then,' I said, turning to the man from whom I had had the loaf, 'if you think I've earned another loaf, you may give it to me; you know after labor comes refreshment.' With that, the man took me into the store and shut the door. He made it fast, looking the place all over; lest  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7507-00000154"/> 304       FAYE MAn. some one might be left lingering behind barrel or corner; then he said, C Harkee, man! You're from the North,right from the hot-bed of them that don't wish well to us. I know it; you needn't speak one word; I don't ask it. The people down here will find it out afore long, and then you'd have to suffer. Now, just for old times' sake, I'm going to help you onward a mite; not that I like you nor your cause, for you meant every word of that sermon turned right t'other way-I know you did.' "I stood still, not daring to look up, for fear my eyes should undeceive my hope. There was something in the tone of the man, lying way down like the granite under the earth, that made me think he detected me through a fellow feeling. ' What are you going to do?' he asked. "Do you think I could make a preacher?' I ventured. He came nearer and whispered, with a tremb- ling in his tones such as I never heard in a mortal whisper before, ' Do you hold the Order before your country?' "' My country is my father and my mother, my Order is my wife; the one was chosen for me, the other was my choice,' I answered, not doubting longer that this man, who had given me proof of his belonging to the Masonic Order, would also   FAYE MAR.         305 give me proof of love of country. It came sooner than I thought. "vI don't ask you any questions, because I do not wish you to answer; but you are here for some object: to carry that out, you can get the appointment of chaplain in the Confederate ser- vice. I will help you to it. Your ability to-day will do you good service.' "' But I never preached a sermon before in my life,' I urged, knowing how utterly I should come short, for I know enough to know that I am not educated; my language comes just as it rises out of my head and my heart; 'tisn't filtered through this nor that grammar. "'Friend, you won't meet with the kind of chaplains down here -that they have in New Eng- land. Zeal and noise, with a little learning, will take you through. Have you any 'better plan?' "'My plans are made and unmade with every step. I'll try the office, if there's anybody to get it for me.' "That night I went to the headquarters, and the next morning I started off as chaplain to a regiment, knowing no more of the duties I ought to fill than a boy; but I went to work with a will, doing everything in such a wild way, they called it original, eccentric, and liked it all the better. "The regiment was made up of different mate-  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7507-00000155"/> 306       FAYE IMAR. rial from any that I seen from the North. I don't say the men weren't brave, but they were not workers; not one in a dozen of them all had ever done an honest day's labor, and the cruel round of war came upon them with greater hardship for that reason. By-and-by duties not belonging to my position as chaplain came to me, such as making up statements of different sorts, lists of officers and men, and whatever it was found that I could do. My friend, who had let me preach for the loaf, had changed the United States money for me, and had concealed the suit I exchanged for the new dress into which I put the chaplain." Isaac paused a moment in his story and said very solemnly: "I consider sometimes in the night-watches-somehow, things do take on new shapes and give out different lights in the dark- ness.  Somehow God comes nearer then, it seems to me.  Well, I Jonsider, and my heart gives sudden starts in a different direction, and a flash comes, throwing a light on the actions of those days, that makes me wish them all back again; but when the sun comes up in the morning I consider again, and then I don't see how I could have done anything different. You see it was carrying a pretty heavy load, Mr. Chester, here, all the time on my heart,-my country on my mind, and on my shoulders a chaplain. But? one day, in mak-   FAYE MAR.        307 ing out a list, from a jumble of names, I felt down- right glad that I had undertaken the duties, for I found the name of my Double, the man whom I used to know, and who was so near like me that his best friends made mistakes. He was. in the Confederate service, and near one of the great prison-places to which I longed to get; knowing that there I might find Mr. Chester. I had not long to wait for my opportunity. At dead of night the regiment was ordered out of camp and marched to meet the foe. The battle began just at the crack of day, and lasted until the night put it down with its heavy blackness. I knew that the regiment to which my Double belonged was a part of the army -that had been fighting that day. The knowledge that I had gained from having been in the South years before, did me wonderful service. I managed to hide all my Yankee ways; I don't think I even said 'I guess' once, unless it was in my sleep. I was allowed to do very much as I pleased; and I pleased, just at the hour of dark- ness, to stray away to the battle-field, and wait an opportunity to get away. I climbed that night to the top of a tree, as I had done the night before I got into service. There were men out looking the field over under a flag of truce. I could see the lights gleam and glimmer in the distance. I could hear groans and delirious cries going up  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7507-00000156"/> 308        FAYE MAR. from the plains but a little way off, and a guilty feeling almost forced me down from my hiding- place to relieve the sufferings. I knew by the stars that it must be about two o'clock, (I knew what time certain stars used to rise) when I heard something like this. You can't tell what it was, coming up out of the gloom. . The tree that I was in stood in a'kind of ravine, down which in the spring a stream must run. The cry was, mind you, not loud, nor sharp, nor long, nor deep, but a nerve cry, wrung right out of the chords of life. You could hear the fibre untwist and break, in the cry, ' Oh, water! water! oh, for one drop of water! water! give me a little, just a little. Mother, bring me some water.' There was stillness then; the man seemed to be lying just under the tree where I was; suddenly it came again in the words, 'I'm dying, I'm most dead,' and then a wail such as condensed all the prayers I ever heard in my life into one: ' O God! please give me water!' c' Off on the fields the men of both armies were overlooking their dead, binding up their wounds, putting to parched lips the cooling tin of the can- t teen, more delicious than the silver of the cups of childhood; and this poor fellow no one came to find. I forgot in that minute, Mr. Chester, the country and myself; I went down the tree, and crawled on my hands and knees in the darkness to   tAYE MAR.         309 find the man from  whom  the call had come. Won't you send that child away a minute," Isaac asked ; "I don't want her to hear." At the words, Ailee, whom every one had forgotten in their in- terest, sobbed out so violently that it was some time before she was soothed-and sent away, and Isaac resumed his story. "There was not a ray of light in the ravine, and I dared not call. You see, the guard was not far away, so I crawled on and on, through the dead leaves of many years, until my hands lost a good part of their skin on the branches and briers. By- and-by I thought I heard breathing ; I waited, and was certain of it-I crawled nearer, put out my hand, thinking to touch the man; it makes me shudder now ; it went down into a pool of blood ; it spattered up on my face, touched my lips, until I came near doing that which the poor fellow was doing ; G-od had, in a measure, heard his prayer ; he was drinking his own blood! I forced away the arm to which his lips were clinging, and put my canteen in its place. I had taken care to fill it before leaving the field. The murmur of deep content, as he felt the water cooling down his throat, was the very extract of gratitude; I know it is just such sounds that go up the highest. "Once or twice I took, or attempted to take, the canteen away ; but he clung to it so, I had no  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7507-00000157"/> 310    iAYE MAi. heart to do it. The poor fellow might never drink again. I sat down close to where he lay and tried to whisper a few words into his ears, to tell him that a friend was near. I asked him if he had any message to send to any one, and all the answer he gave was-' Tell them you brought me water.' "I could know nothing of the nature of his hurts. He lay quite motionless ; I reckoned he slept until the day began to break. The sounds from the camps stirred the air ; I fixed my eyes on the figure I knew must be lying close by me, and every moment could discern a bit more and more through the gloom, until I saw a soldier wearing the Con- federate uniform ; then a bucketful more light was poured into the day, and I saw that this man, this Confederate soldier, was my Double. I knew his name, I knew that I had lived for a time in the same city with him, I knew that I might pass almost anywhere for him. Here he was, dying in the ravine that lay, as I climbed the tree to look, scarcely half a mile from the battle- field of the day before. "When I went back to see if I could help the man, his eyes were open, his mouth was fixed in that last, unalterable expression of death. Life was over with him. I had no time to think; the war-calls were sounding faster, clearer, all about. I went down deep into the ravine and looked about.   VATE MA L        3 1 There was an old log that had been soaked into the ground by rains and dampness until it was more than half buried. - I tugged away until I got it out of the bed. The place underneath it then was dry as summer's dust, and just about long enough for a'grave. It was heavy work carrying that dead man down to the place, but I was urged on by the impulse to save my own life. I parted the tangled vines and drew the body into the shelter. Mr. Chester, it was a solemn sort of a room to dress in, hung all around with leafy cur- tains, through which the clang of arms came. "I took off the uniform of my Double, put that of the chaplain upon him, and put myself into the blood-stained clothes he had worn; then buried him in the bed where the log had lain. "There were some papers in his pockets, a pic- ture of a face he had loved, I hoped, and one of the papers, as I sat down, my work done, to look them -over, made my heart leap with joy. It was his appointment to an office in connection with the very prison to which I ached to get. That was my place now.  The chaplain I had buried up under the mosses, and branches, and leaves, know- ing full well, as I did so, that had he not been buried, he could never get safely out of the Con- federate lines; for, even then, he must be known in all the camp as a spy. The Union army won that  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7507-00000158"/> 312        FAYE MAR. battle-field, through the services of a chaplain in Confederate gray. "I went up from the ravine a man named John Paul. There was a small diary in John Paul's pocket, which promised to be of especial use, for it contained many statements of facts existent in his life, that it was essential the new man should know. It was the duty of this John Paul to take control of and conduct prisoners taken on the day before, to the prison. He reported before the battle was well in progress on the second day, and did his duty with all honesty of purpose; the United States and the chaplain were taken off his mind and shoulders, so that he moved on easier; beside, the weight on his heart was somehow growing lighter and lighter as he thought he was getting nearer to it; weights are so heavy when we have to carry them at arms' length. "I had to look more than once at the little diary in my pocket as we went slowly onward; 800 and more of my own countrymen bound to all the horrors of a prison life. Finally, I got lost and bewildered; so I feigned illness, and appointed some one else to take the advance. The second day we reach the place of horrors. Do you know that no man ever longed to see the little roof that bent above his home more than I did to see the   FAYE MAR.         313 ugly inclosure, inside of which something told me I should find Mr. Chester. "When we reached the prison, great handbills were there, printed in letters one couldn't fail to read, offering $5,000 Confederate money for one Isaac Griffin, late a chaplain in ---- regiment, and behold, my own face, on the bill, that all men finding might know me, was over the prison bars. The illness which I had feigned on the march did me excellent service that night. I lay wide awake, listening to every word, watching every move- ment, until before midnight I had caught the names of the officers in that ward, and knew pretty much all their duties. When the lights were turned down, (the officers had gone off to bed ex- ulting over the pile of prisoners that had been brought in) I managed to read the diary, and to put its contents into my mind as thoroughly as I once had the sermon. I knew just how long John Paul had been in the service, what prisons he had been in, who their commandants were, and at last, when at daybreak I fell asleep, it was to wake up thor- oughly imbued with the spirit of the man I had buried in the ravine but forty-eight hours before. "I arose and went about my duties, putting on a weary, listless air that I was far from feeling; but you see I had to feign utter indifference to cruelties that tore into my very heart. Two or "  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7507-00000159"/> 314       FAYE MA.  three times I arrested a scream of horror, as some face, that I had known in the happy days of peace, looked out at me under the form of a pris- oner, too wretched to know himself, if- a looking- glass had been set before him. "It was one of John Paul's duties to call the prison-roll. He had been busy many hours in making out the roll of the new prisoners, and was still at it when reminded of the time. "'Is it all ready?' he asked; I are the prisoners all up?' "' As usual, sir, all that can be made to get up; more than half of 'em are mere shams.' "Very well, go on, I want you,' I said not even knowing the direction I ought to take. I followed on. The prisoners were gathered in a kind of square yard; there was just standing room arranged so that, as the men stood, they were tieri above tier, that, as each one made answer to the call, his head could be seen. The ground had been terraced to suit the purpose. "If I could get out of my mind the picture of all those wretched men as they stood before me that day, I should be glad. It was a picture-gal- 'lery such as the world never looked into. I some- times think I shall be forced to paint it, to get it out of my head. "The long roll-call was set before me. Now   * xE a t. R.

The names were old names, some of them the very earliest that I had heard, good old New York and New England names: why, I knew just where their fathers' houses were standing then, and my eyes blinded so with tears that I gave the roll over to another, and sat with my face crowded into my hands, waiting for the names. There was a long list of C's that I had taken note of. "It came at last, the name that set every pulse in me leaping: ' David Chester.' The man read it out loud and clear. It was still as death after the call. Again it was read. 'Ill in cot No. 5, seventh ward,' was the response. The: list went on, but I scarcely gave heed to a name. "It was John Paul's duty to walk through the prison at certain hours of the night-at nine o'clock that night he went. ' He is growing hu- mane, getting a bit human,' a voice whispered as I stopped by each cot, making some simple inquiry into the case, preparatory to a longer pause in ward seven. "It was a low, dismal place, The cots were not spread with snowy linen, they were not spread  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7507-00000160"/> 316        FAYE MAR. at all. On the sacking the men lay, looking only less dismal than the terrace of heads I had seen at roll-call. I No. Five, that must be near the door, I thought, but no! It was in the farthest, most dis- mal corner of the most dismal place. John Paul tottered up to the cot, half holding fast to the side of it. There 'was no gentle nurse near--no one in the whole prison. "'David Chester, are you able to be moved?' John Paul asked. 'Some of the prisoners are to go farther on, to make room for the new ones.' "' You can judge,' was the reply, and he showed me cause why he could not Cmove on.' I took the roll out of my pocket and made a mark, indicating that that prisoner was to stay. He asked to look at it. I gave him the roll. He looked up in my face and pointed to the writing. I looked at him? no! John Paul looked across the ward instead, and shouted out an order, that left echoes ringing all about the place, while, with his lips, he formed the words, 'I am Isaac--I'll save you.' "We came home; how, Mr. Chester can tell better than I." "Afterwards, when I began to think of being happy, 'cause God don't let a man go lonesome and sorrowful all the way, I used to take out the   FAYE MAR.        317 picture John Paul had in his pocket and look at it, thinking, since I knew how dear one human being may get to be to another, that maybe this woman was waiting yet for John Paul to come home from the war. "As my happiness grew more and more, that woman's lonesome sorrow grew within it, until I couldn't stand it another day. I dreamed about it, and a voice kept sounding in my ears, ' Don't be happy yet-not yet'-and at the last minute I was driven off by the voice. I felt like a double traitor not to go and find that woman; for you see I didn't doubt but what she was alive and waiting: so I went. "I shied around the very ravine where I had buried the chaplain, Isaac Griffin; there was a great tangle grown into it since that time, and the chance of finding him was very poor; but I kept at it, till I knew he had never been disturbed in his long sleep by friend or foe. "Then I started off to find the man for whom I had preached for a loaf. Poor fellow, he was gone. He meant well by me. Then I went down to the city where John Paul and Isaac had lived a little while. I dared not make myself known. I was accosted as John Paul one night as I was standing under a gaslight, by a black woman, or rather, said she, t Bress de Lord! Massa Paul,  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7507-00000161"/> 318       FAYE 1MAR. you's a-living. Won't you speak a word to old Maria, as used to care for her darlin'?' "'Maria! I'm glad to see you,' I said, 'come around and get some clothes for me. Can you get them ready to-morrow?' "Yes, Massa, I has 'em dis night, if you can come right away.' I gave the woman my number, and went on my way gladly, quite certain, then, that my search would be short. "Black Maria proceeded with her basket of clothes, and an hour after, a knock told that she had come. "I shut the door, and stood before her and said: 'Maria! you knew John Paul a long time ago, didn't you?' "' Before he could say a word.' "'Take a good look at me, Maria. Now, don't scream, don't make one breath of noise; for I am. not John Paul. I came down here to look for some  of his friends, though. Can you tell me where they are?' "'Not John Paul! not Massa John Paul!' she whispered, c not my Massa Paul dat I toted about?' "'Maria, do you know anything about his friends?' I urged. "'Friends!' ejaculated the old woman, raising herself to majestic height. 'Friends! does any- body know?   Did the war leave anyfriends?'   FAYE MAR.        319 "Can't you tell me where they lived,' I urged, as she was gathering up the bundle of clothes to go. She did not answer, but moved on toward the door, quite, dazed. I really believe she would have taken me for a ghost, if it had not been for the real bundle I had given her. I caught her arm and stayed her, to ask it over again, but only a similar answer could she give. They used to live in the city, but the war carried them away, was all that she could tell. C It was the third day that I had been up and down the city, looking at every business sign- directory there was not-when I chanced to think of the burying-ground, and went there. I found some names of Pauls, and looked at the graves, think;ing how strange it would have been if I'd died and been brought down there to be buried with the Pauls as John Paul. While I was look- ing at them, there came into the yard a lady dressed in the deepest kind of black, with a veil longer than- any bride's I ever saw, though 'twas made of crape, and she went over to a corner and sat down in the middle of a place all full of graves, and she kissed the sod over them, just as if I hadn't been there at all; then she cried and cried, till I began to think she'd cry herself sick if I didn't speak. So I went up and said, ' Madam, could I do any-  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7507-00000162"/> 320        FAYE MAR. thin for you? you seem in great distress about something.' "She was a lady, I knew before she spoke. "'C What mother would not be in distress to know her sons are in these graves?' she said. ' You can do nothing for me, I must carry my troubles after my boys to the grave. I wish it might be soon.' "I counted the number; there were seven. "'Are the seven yours?' I asked. "' Mine all, my seven boys, my sacrifice to my country. In their young glory they went from me. My country returned them to me, dead.' "' Do you love your country, the South, yet?' I asked.' "' Do we lovewhat we have suffered for?' she asked. 'Ask the mothers of the South. Ask the mothers of the North for whom the war has dug graves. They know what love of country may be.' "' Do you know any Pauls about here?' I ven- tured to ask. ' I have been looking into the yard over there.' "'The war scattered them.  They were my State's people once, but the last I knew of them they were in Mississippi.' "The lady could not tell me any plan for dis- covering the place where I ought to find the family. I turned to go away, with a weight on my mind.   FAYE MAR.         321 You see I hadn't learned the lesson of hope right, or I should have been saying to myself, 'Now, Isaac, you found Mr. Chester down in a prison, and you mustn't think you can't find free folks, when you've such a face to go by in your pocket.' I reckon some such thought may have run across my head and left a little track behind it, for I had got as far as the gate-the lady had turned again to her seven graves-when I went about and showed her the picture. "Madam, will you tell me if you know that face?' I asked. '"She wiped her eyes two or three times before she could seem to see anything. 'Oh! where did you find this?' she cried. "(But do tell me, if you can, where the lady is.: "' Do you know it?' she asked. "' No, I would give a good deal to find out where I could get a few words with her, though.' "' I can tell you, it is C' Georgie." "' Georgie!' I said, more puzzled than before. "'Yes, Georgianna Dimmock. She did more to inspire our soldiers, to urge them onward, than any one woman in this region.' "(But where can I find her, Madam?' "The lady took a card from her case, and writ- ing upon it, handed it to me in silence.  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7507-00000163"/> 322        FAYE MAR. "This is the card;" and Isaac gave it to Mrs. Chester. On it were these words: 'Georgianna Dimmock is in   Asylum for the Insane." "I read the words you see there with a shudder, and hurried out of the ground, determined to visit the asylum mentioned, and beg my way to a sight of ' Georgie' Dirnmock. "Three hundred miles of travel, across a region without any established conveyances, cost me ten days of time. "The asylum was not like any that I had seen. I had thought to find an institution similar to those in the North; but though the building was unlike, the physician in attendance was very much the same stamp of man I had encountered before. He refused to let me see the lady. She had been placed there with a prospect of recovery, and he was not going to do anything to retard it. 'There wasn't the least mite of hope,' he said, ' not if I staid a week.' Isaac never felt so near broke down in his life as he did that night, to think he'd come so near easing his conscience and couldn't be al- lowed to do it. In the morning things looked brighter. It didn't seem a bit as if anybody was locked up in that little, low building, that I couldn't get at, if I tried the right way. "So I went out to take a walk, and think if I couldn't contrive some Yankee way of seeing Miss   FAYE MAR.        323 Georgianna Dimmock. There was a crumb of a hill on one side the town; the folks down there called it Mount something or other, I don't re- member what-but I walked up it, and sat down there and thought and thought; but no good came of it. I suppose the physician there was king and governor, and all. Well, when I'd got the country that lay around pretty much by heart, I climbed down and got into the road. 'Twas tol- erably steep along for a good piece, but I wasn't thinking much about the road or anything else nigh there, when I heard a horse coming along at a big gait, for that road. There was a sharp cor- ner back a ways, and I stood still to see what was coming. "Round it came, the little light carriage and the fiery horses; at the curve, the driver was thrown out, and only a little child left in. I saw so much, and then the horses were down upon me. I stopped them and saved the child-Heaven only knows how. " Good man! good man!' cried the boy, ' now go and pick up my papa, won't you?' "I lifted the child down, soothed and madefast the excited horses, and then went back to look af- ter the driver. I tell you, Mr. Chester, we're all savages, real wild Indians; for when I saw the man, I wanted to set him in the wagon and start  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7507-00000164"/> 324        FAYE MAR. him off again over the bridge below, at the same gait, for it was the Doctor, who had denied me the day before. "Instead of doing as I wanted to at the first minute, I helped him up, brought him water from a spring not far away, helped him wash off the sand from his bruises, and then drove him home. He didn't know me for the person he had refused the day before; so, when he got to expressing his gratitude, because I had saved his -boy's life, I turned round, and said I, 'What would you do for me, if you found me in trouble?' "' Do! I'd do anything in reason that I could; if ever you are, let me know it.' '"Well, Doctor; I'm the man that came to you last night. I see you don't know me by daylight. I want to see Miss Dimmock, and I must see her.' "' You shall,' said he; and in no time I was walking along the corrider, lined with rooms, from which sounds, that no wild beasts could equal, were coming. "As we came to the last apartment the Doctor said: - 'Now, you must be prepared for a sorrow- ful sight. I don't know what this lady may be to you, so prepare yourself for it.' A soft voice I could hear, crooning in Southern fashion, that ceased as the lock turned. There started up to   FAYE MAR.        325" confront -me the wildest face on earth. The eyes were turned upward, as if appealing to heaven, as she cried: ' It was I; I did it; I urged him on to go; I told him he was a coward, and I'd enlist to shame him, if he did not. Oh, John Paul's mother, take your curses away from me,' "' Miss Dimmock,' said the physician, 'I've  brought a friend to see you; look! don't you know him?' "All at once the eyes dropped and rested on me. The demon seemed to go out of her with a great cry as she looked. If a sinner ever dies, ex- pecting to be lost, and wakes up to find himself in heaven, I reckon he will look something as she did then. She didn't come forward; as I thought she might, to touch me. She only stood perfectly still, and said so calmly, '0 Lord! I thank thee that I have seen John Paul alive.' "The  Doctor was amazed. ' What's this? what does it mean?' he cried, as I, hurried away out of that young woman's sight, lest she should be undeceived. "' Doctor,' said I, when we had got safely out side, 'it's a curious story; it's best maybe thai you shouldn't know the whole of it; if that pa tient don't see me again, I reckon she'll be fit tco send home; but now, I want you just to ask her one or two questions for me.  I want to know ":  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7507-00000165"/> 326       FAYE MAR. where John Paul's folks are--his father and mother; you see, since the'war they've all moved about so much that I can't find them.' "He wasn't gone long, and when he came back, said he;. 'Miss Dimmock is just as rational as I am; she's told me all the story about her insanity; how it was the thought of having urged you on to the war when your own mother did not wish you to go, had made her crazy. She is just about as happy to know that you are not dead as anybody ever was at anything. The Pauls are living on the river,' and he named the place. "'Well,' said I, 'maybe when she has been asleep and  wakes up she will think it's all a dream.  So I will leave this picture, and I wish you'd put it right where she'll see it the first thing.' "The man promised he would, and with that I made haste to get away, more than half afraid I should be found out for an impostor, but no one knew the true John Paul, I found, in that region; so I went back and wrote my name at the tavern where I had staid the night before, wrote it out, full and clear, as John Paul. You see I had learned his handwriting at the prison, and with much trouble at copying, so that I don't believe his best friend could have told the difference. I did that thing with a sorrowful heart; but I   FAYE MAR.        327 knew the young woman, if she kept her reason, would go here and there picking up all the evi- dence she could get hold of, and I didn't want her to doubt, for fear 'twould put her right back again as bad as ever. "You see I felt paid already for my long trip, but off I started before noonday for the place on the Mississippi where the Paul family were then living. I wanted to make all the restitution that lay in my power. "I reckon I traveled too much by night; or else the country was in a mighty unhealthy state, for I don't see what else should make me sick; but I fell ill at the little town you know of, on my way, and there- I lay on my bed for six weeks and more, tended as humanely as if I'd been a brother. If some of the folks I know, that had helped to get up the war, had happened to be down there, ill, as I was, I reckon 'twould have been better for both sides; they'd helped each other to get out of trouble instead of piling it up the way they did. However, I suppose the war was to be, and so it was. "As oon as I could move on I went and reached  the plantation of John Paul's father, just at night on the second day after I started. I felt weak, and was pretty well wasted after the fever, that had changed me so much that I didn't think I  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7507-00000166"/> 328       FAYE MAR. could still look enough like my Double to deceive anybody; so I went on, up to the very house, and got out of the conveyance that had brought me the last half-dozen miles. I saw some ladies sit- ting out on the piazza, that was as thick with the vines as could be. I could just tell them by their white dresses coming through. I felt uncommon weak as I walked up the steps and on toward the door. You see there wasn't more'n half light enough to see anybody clear. "' O God! That's John!' I heard a woman's voice cry; and then, before I could speak out and say I wasn't John at 'all, I was smothered with hugs and kisses, and felt somebody else's tears going over my face. They were dropping down on me from a tall, old man who held me tight. Didn't I feel like ten thousand prodigal sons all hurried up into one! I panted, and tried to shake them off, but they clung tighter than ever; and being so weak, they got the best of it, and carried me by storm, so that I found myself in the house, and saw dozens of dusky faces peer- ing in at me, until I thought maybe I'd got near discovering the head of the Nile. "That was when I came to, and felt something gliding down my throat. I reckon I'd been a little too long without eating that day. "Do   you know  the awful wicked thought,   FAYE MAR.        329 temptation, or whatever else you've a mind to call it, came into my head to make believe I was Paul, and to live there, in the midst of all that love and tenderness, and have a home, like other men. I don't believe now but what, if it hadn't been for somebody near here, I might have been left to the wickedness. ; It came mighty trying to say c You're all mis- taken, I am not your son and brother;' but I said it, and no one would believe me. HC CHis head is turned with all he's had to un- dergo,' whispered a young lady who had been the. first to kiss me. ' Mother, don't ask him a ques- tion to-night, let him go to bed and rest.' "So off up-stairs I was taken, willing or not willing, and not a word would anybody listen to that night. It was nigh morning when I fell asleep, and a big part of the way toward noon when I woke up. "The very first thing that I did was to ring a little bell that had been put on a chair by my bed. There wasn't much need of it, though, for two or three persons appeared on the instant, showing that my sleeping had been under ward. "I asked them to send Mr.. Paul to me; I had something very particular to say to him. When he came,.I wanted everybody else to be sent out of hearing, and then I told all of the story that I  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7507-00000167"/> 330        FAYE MAR. thought he need to know; but no more attention did he pay than to the winds blowing, until I came to describe the very place where he would find Paul buried; then I believe. the first doubt got into his mind, though he persisted in thinking I was crazy, and one time I actually feared that I should get carried off to the very asylum I had visited before the sickness came down on me. " I'd always kept John Paul's little diary, and I gave that to Mr. Paul, and finally told him how I had gone to the place where Miss Dimmock was confined, and given her the picture of herself that I had taken from John Paul after he had died; and that she believed I was he. Then I said how John Paul and I had lived awhile in the same city, and had been taken one for the other. I told him all about Storm-Cliff, and that he might go there and find out, for I had lived there afore the war. "I wish I need never to hear again the sighs and laments when I told the same story over again to the mother and the sisters. It was only when I promised to take Mr. Paul to the very place where his son was buried, and he had started with me, that he fully believed. "The country was so broken up that it took a long time to get so far northward, but we reached the place at last. I took him into the ravine, and he insisted on seeing the remains of his son taken   FAYE MAR.        331 out of it. There was little left by which he could have been known; the chief things were a ring that I had not seen to take off his finger in the half twilight of the morning I buried him, and a mark or two in the growing of his finger nails that no- thing but home love would have treasured in mem- ory. I parted from him  and came home, when everything had been made ready for that solitary return, with all that was left of poor John Paul. O' Olive, we shall take that plantation-home on the Mississippi, as a point- in our travel, when we are married." They were the words with which Isaac ended his story. Afterward, before and at the marriage, Faye Chester had often asked her husband of the man- ner in which he had effected his escape with Isaac from the prison, and had as often been put off with a vague remark, indicating mere dislike to recur to the days of his prison life. Seeing the sub- ject to be one of pain, she had refrained from press- ing it, and Isaac was as non-committal in his con- versation of the past as he had been in his story. Not a soul about Storm-Cliff would have dared to question him regarding his name, and Olive's faith was so entire, that she woald have believed him if he had told her it was "Isaac Solomon,"  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7507-00000168"/> 332        FAYE MAR, The days came and went until the very one drew near on which the marriage was to take place: it was only a fortnight after Isaac's return. Mrs. Chester was restored to health, and luxuri- ated in the glorious autumnal weather. It was the time when all things are at the fulness of be- ing; the very earth is mellow and gives a dint, to show how ripe she is, to those who press a loving finger into her. In the early morning and at noonday she was abroad, living as near to Nature as civilization will permit; sometimes alone, oftener with Mr. Chester and Ailee, and, one day, with Isaac, on the beach. There was about Isaac a little something that sat upon the man's character as oddly as a dove on the head of a lion. It came out on that day, beating its wings with a few curious words. "Mrs. Chester, he said, "I offered you advice once, and you took it, and I want to ask your counsel now; do you think I ought to marry Olive, when my name is only Isaac?" "Certainly; if she is satisfied, no one can make a complaint." "Well, but are you?" "Isaac, I shall never doubt you. I never have since the hour you brought my husband back to me." "But what if there is something to tell; some- thing I didn't know when I asked her."   FAYE MAR.     -   333 "She accepted you just as you were." "Then you mean I am not in honor bound to tell her now?" "Not unless it is something that will give her pain, something that will cause her to be unhappy. after marriage." "Mrs. Chester, IS have something here that I want to give to you; maybe you had better always keep it to yourself. I don't know whether I did right to do it, -but somehow I couldn't bear to leave it down there. Don't open it until after I am gone; it may make you feel a little bad just at first." Mrs. Chester received the paper, and the day following Isaac and Olive were married at Storm- Cliff. All their-friends in the fishing village were invited to the wedding. Ailee was happy at last, to her heart's content, in being a bridesmaid. The ceremony was over; the certificate was brought forward for signature. A  slight quiver went over Isaac's face as he took the pen and wrote his name upon the blank that had been left for it, the clergyman not knowing how to fill it. Olive, in her trepidation, never even glanced at the name. The Chester carriage conveyed Isaac and Olive to the same railway station, from which we have known them to go and come many times 'since this simple story had beginning. They were  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7507-00000169"/> 334        FAtE MAit. started forth on their life's journey. Ailee sighed as she laid aside her pretty dress, because the happiness had been so short. The same night the little lady of Storm-Cliff hovered around the room awhile, and then the old instinct crept over her, and she was down on the hearth-rug, the same play of fire-light going over face, and eyes, and hair. She looked as much the girl as when she had first sat there; perhaps 'twas the new life that was growing brighter and brighter every day that made her seem so cheerful that night. Ailee, the little picture of sturdy health and strong life, dropped herself beside her, laid her head down on her lap, and fell asleep. David Chester was sitting in his favorite chair over against the fireplace, half looking, half dream- ing, with the sleeve that never more would wear a living arm in it, hanging loosely over the chair. "David," said his wife, looking out from the flame light. "David, don'tl you are thinking of something that happened in the war, I know; but, see here, there is something I forgot." It was too late in coming--the consciousness that Isaac had said "it was better, perhaps, to keep it from Mr. Chester." It was as well it came too late, for the wife was saved the effort, which would have proved fdtile3 of keeping anything   - FAYE 1MAR.       335 from her husband. She drew the little paper out and opened it, read on a bit, and threw Ailee's head out of her lap in rather of an unmotherly way, as she sprang up and put her arms around David Chester's neck, exclaiming, "Oh, if I had Isaac here one minute!" 'C Well, Faye, what would you do? treat him as you do -me? let me see that paper." She gave it, and he read: "Mrs. Chester, I am a queer man-my life is not made. up like that of the, great mass around me, and I do things sometimes without knowing any reason why--out of instinct maybe, a word which we use in the animal world, just as philoso- phers use electricity for anything, power, I 'mean, that they don't understand. When Mr. Chester had to undergo the trial of parting with one of his arms, I couldn't forget that it had been part of himself; his blood had run through its veins; his will had moved every muscle of it; his nerves had quickened it; with it- ]e carried you up from Sthrm-Clif one nigt7. I thought sometime, maybe, you would think and wonder what was done with it. I saved it on the day it parted from Mr. Chester.

The paper contained an enclosure, that had slid upon the rug unheeded as Mrs. Chester sprang up. Its contents ran thus: "DEAR FRIENDS--I have foreborne to ask you to take my joy with me, because it seemed too precious, at the first, to share with any one. I called myself Isaac because I knew, in honesty, no other name. I believed myself entitled to none beside it. I am now, as I have ever been, without knowledge of it, Isaac Paul, twin brother of my double, John Paul. "The wrong by which I was snatched away in infancy can never be repaired. It grew out of the sin of slavery, and was committed as an act of re- venge by that Maria who recognized me under the gas-light in a strange city. "I take Olive to my father's house to greet my mother and my sisters. My long, lonesome way is ended. "IsAAC PAUL."   FAYE aAR.        337 CHAPTER XXIY. PRISON MEMORIES. AFTER Isaac's departure, Mrs. Chester found' one day, in searching seldom-used places, a crum- pled MS. which I here transcribe. PRISON MEMORIES. "I can not endure this any longer. "Why is it that, as I sit watching Faye's face, with my eyes so fixed there that I know I do not see anything but it, images, forms, are pouring in on my brain; pursuing me as if I had wronged them?  When she moans with pain, or stirs, the phantoms, if phantoms they are, disappear. As soon as it grows still-when the clock begins to tick the seconds--it acts like a bugle call to stir them in again. "I am  well nigh maddened by the sights, sounds, words, woes, of those prison days.

Put the school of philosophers where I have been, and it will be made clear. A criminal is compelled to confess his crime, because he cannot endure silence; there is an outward, downward pressure on his soul, of the crime itself; as if the weight of the whole atmosphere were let down on him. At the same time, heart, brain, nerve, fibre, cry aloud for the relief of confession. "It is so natural to tell our troubles. Some- thing of this feeling leads me to catch up this paper and write out a few of the clearest phan- toms that haunt me so. "Faye has so often asked me to tell her about my prison days. She does not know what she asks. Tell her! Why I would as soon put an infant to drive a locomotive engine.  She saw enouoh of horror to suffice any innate tendency for the horrible-with which I suppose the whole creation to be endowed-in the few days she was at the camp hospital. "Now, in her delirious moments, she starts and puts out her hands, as if to ward off a harm close at hand. It may be some look of agony painted up from that past, and hung in her brain, that, as the wheels of life revolve, comes into view. "In vain I summon up all the courage   the pride, the determination of mv ancestors; there is nothing  of which I am   master that is strong   FAYE MAR.         ;339 enough to conquer the torture I feel, because I can not forget those days. "I heard a criminal once say, that he never felt so happy in his life as he did after he had con- fessed his crime; it was almost worth while to have murdered his man, he said, 'just for the com- fort of having told of it.' I don't wonder he felt so. He had been haunted fourteen years, hoping, the latter half of that time, nay, anxiously long- ing, to have some one find him out. The story was all told when he cried, ' I would have thrown my arms around any man who would have stepped up and pointed his finger at me, and cried out, Cyou are a murderer; you killed that man!"I would have kissed him, just out of thankfulness. I should have known then that I had a friend.' "So I am going to confess to this paper, as I sit here, some of the scenes which I witnessed, hoping the confession will give me proportionate relief. " It is but a night or two to the time of the crisis of Faye's fever. As the hour draws near, the dread grows in upon me; the possible shows its dark side, but she has taught, me more of faith, courage, hope, trust, nay, of love itself, than I thought could ever come into my life. It is this human love that gives us the first, truest idea of the unfathomable possibilities of Divine Love.  &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7507-00000172"/> 340        FAYE MAR. "I can see now that parental affection ought first to kindle the idea, so that the soul should grow grandly up into the higher atmosphere; but to those who, missing that, as I had done, there comes in the fulness of their powers a joy such as come to me, there can be no want. "It does not seem possible that there is room enough between the face I 'watch and my own, for all the emaciated, hungering forms to crowd, that half shut out my darling's from me. "Human nature never asserts itself more strongly in its grand, heroic tendencies, in its weak, pitful phases, than on the battle-field. It was thus in the awful days that preceded my cap- ture. "Hundreds of men were made prisoners by mistake, a mere change of word, and the officer who committed the error was without the manli- ness to acknowledge himself the author of the dis- aster, while the men who heard the order could not testify to the truth. "That officer was courageous, brave, manly, in the presence of the enemy; before the moral qual- ity of Truth he was a weak coward.  I met him afterward.  His is one of the haunting faces. "It was near night when the order came   to which I have referred. It sent our diminished   FAYE MAR.         341 regiment, which had been in the thick of the fight all day, across a field to the succor of a hard- pressed portion of the army. Because of its ex- posed situation, the field had been avoided by both armies. Knowing full well that the chances were against reaching the point, our little force bravely set forth, to be advanced upon from the rear; to be pressed back upon from the front, until there was not a man of it who was not either left dead or d-ying on the field, or made a prisoner. a It is useless to deny that the heaviest penal- ties of war, the severest cruelties of prison life, were not reserved for men who had enlisted from New England. If there was a last turn of the screw, it was saved for a Massachusetts soldier. It was because there lurked in the minds of the Southerners a belief that the men who came from that region set forth with a will about them- joined the army from the love of it. I think now, as I look back, that there was a faint glow of truth- in the belief. I knew one man who, when he found himself in danger of being captured, deliberately changed his uniform for that of a dead officer from the South-West.   I will not judge him; he had been six months in their hands on one occasion. I might do the same if I were to be tried. "At night the prisoners were driven into a hol- low among  the hills for easier keeping.

"The guard built fires on the circle above; the wind sucked the smoke down upon us, whirling it like as if it had been an inverted chimney with a subterranean outlet. In the daylight, we had a smoke-cured look. How many times, in the weeks that came afterward, I looked back upon that night and that smoky-hollow  as a sort of Paradise! "The Prison! I see it now. I know every brick and stone; every mortar-line that runs about it. I see it from all sides; for many days it was a relief to look at it, because its material seemed the only thing that did not suffer; but chiefly I  know it from the inside. "Discipline and order had not been the rule in the lives of the men to whose care the prison and prisoners were commlitted. In the place of disci- pline, there was exhausting cruelty; in lieu of or- der, confusion, that added ten-fold to the misery that came from over-crowding. "  There was one gathering together of the hor- rible, a congress of the cruelties, that I would have to pass daily before the eyes of men-if   FAYE MAB.        343 such there be--who for any cause less than the country's, failed to make exchange of prisoners. I. witnessed it daily, until I could endure the thing no longer, and I begged permission to ter- race the enclosure where the men came at the roll- call. It was accomplished while Faye was on her homeward voyage; there was a thought of her with every shovelful of earth I moved. It gave me a sensation of unearthing myself, struggling out to life and freedom, where I should find her. It was self-relief perhaps, more than desire tc soften the hard pressure on men too weak to bear it, that induced me to the work. ' Tall, gaunt, over-grown John Brown, was the man on whom more than any other. was poured out the special, spiteful wrath of the officers. What a misfortune to have gone into the army, bearing that name; yet I never could learn that he was of the family of him of universal memory. He stands before me now, so thin, so emaciated, with not a curve in his outline, except the arch of his noble head, that even Death could not rob the beauty from. In a fit of anger one day the officer on duty had commanded him to appear at roll-call until Death had put his name on some other list. "With a grim determination the man- obeyed the summons.

The prison was, in that winter, receiving men al- most daily, and when a heavy battle was in antici- pation, the rations were lessened, the horrors were increased ten-fold, that living menmight crowd in; yet involved with ghosts, skeletons, with what-I can never define with words, than lively dead men. "John Brown was at first supported, then held, then urged, dragged, at last carried, morning and evening, to the terrace, and, with a will undaunted and a voice that makes me cringe with horror even now, he shrieked forth the word that told his pre- sence. His fine old head lay helplessly over on that of his comrades, when he was called up for the Jast time. The chords refused to stiffen in his neck, the very veins only gave a quiver, as he made one final effort to hold it erect and answer. His mind was clear even then, for he was listening to the names, and knew just the moment when his was to come. I lifted the man's head. He gave the response, and was carried out. There was not a man of the crowd made miserable, whose eyes were either too busy or too weak to fix themselves on John Brown that night. The man had starved to death before their eyes, without uttering cry or complaint. The food that could keep life afloat in other men failed to suffice with him. "There had been an accession of prisoners that   FAYE MAR.         345 day. The quadrangle into which the men were crowded was at the full, but it was so managed that John Brown was granted increased space to die in. He lay on the ground at midnight, the winter moon' shining on his head, illuminating each shrunken fold of skin, his eyes not famished of their light, glowing and glowing  more and more, as if the very death-rattle in his throat were glorious music with which he was to be ush- ered into the world to come. "Suddenly all was still, the rattle ceased, the eyes lost their brilliancy. "'He's dead! Poor old soul! He's gone at last!' The words were whispered by one and an- other. Meanwhile the very shadow   of death seemed to be falling over his form. There was a movement among the men; 'they bent to lift him. He started up. 'Boys! Carry me in at roll-call in the morning. Carry me in!' he cried, and fell backward.   There was no sign given that night of a death in the quadrangle, and in the morning the ' boys' carried him in. The roll was called. There came no answer when his name was uttered. The officer looked up, and there confronted him the dead face of John Brown. 'He's put on another list, sir,' spoke a'soldier on the terrace. 'Cyrus Dome was an officer in,a, Maine- regi-  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7507-00000175"/> 346        FAYE MAR. ment, a man who had come down from the vital air of the vast pine forests of that State, bringing in with him into our dismal place more freedom and warmth than any other man who was added to the list. He told me his story one day when the rain was thick, and the place at the lowest ebb of comfort. I remember it now, and him as he told it. His joy made the whole place to shine, it was so real; it seemed to irradiate light, warmth, heat, life itself. He ended it thus: 'I am forty years old, and I feel as if life were only just begin, the long struggle of my boyhood and youth, the putting away, day after day, year after year, of the very things my soul was thirsty for, and then at the very last to know that it was not all in vain to be told in words, that the heart I cared for out of all the world was mine.' ' Do you think,' said he, 'that this prison is anything to mze? that this hunger which we feel is to be compared with that I have known when my body was well nourished? It will take a longer time to starve and freeze me than the country can afford to carry on this war. I wonder if the water drips down now in the for- ests of Maine as it does here. I am going back to Annie Branch as surely as I know there's a rain- bow set on the hills this minute somewhere, though where, I can not see.' f That story was told us the first month of our   FAYE MAR,         347 captivity. The ravages of disease, want and hun- ger crept in faster and faster until the place be- came one great whirl of torment. That prison- its life, its scenes of horror, men dying without a wave of comfort ever rolling to their lips, without a word of home-love floating around the sod that too often formed the pillow whereon death found them.: "Cyrus Dome lived on his happiness, weeks, months, until, at the last, the air he inhaled, the miasma  of human   beings, crushed, crowded, pressed down, verily trodden under foot in the wine-press of that war, crept into his system. He came to me the day he was taken ill. ' Ir. Ches- ter,' he said, 'there. is something taking hold on me that I've struggled against as long as I can, only don't let it put the love of my life out. If I lie down over theie in the crowd, will you come and urge me up again?  Tell me I'm a soldier of the Union, tell me I've a mother to live for. Mr. Chester, when everything else fails, whisper t/c name of Annie Branch in my ears; srouse me by that. I'll get up at the call. It means more to me than women's names mean to other men; it runs in and out with all the pattern of my life; it isn't a trimming that can be put on and taken off at will.. I'm going to rest a little, come and call me.' "He went, lay down on the d4mp ground, and  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7507-00000176"/> 348       FAYE MAR. rested-until the Resurrection! I kept my prom- ise. Afterward I learned that Annie Branch was dead even then. Possibly he heard the rousing call from the other shore; he was deaf to mine. "The things that haunted me so are gone, and now comes up the picture of our Little Home, as we used to call Willie St. John-noble, darling Willie St. John. I must tell Faye, if she lives, of him. "The Loving Kindness that never fails sent Willie St. John into our prison-house. The boy lost his mother in some one of the distant homes of the West, and was so home-sick for her that he could not stay in the place where she had been, and was not; so lie followed the army into the war. A curious place to find the fair lad, but not one man thought of sending him to the front. He was taken prisoner, and brought down to the prison- house on the same day that I was. I did so hope the commandant would look upon the boy in the light of his youth and send him beyond the lines. I am forced to think it was in self-defence that he was prisoned; it was such a pleasure to look upon his face; it kept alive so much of home; came nearer to being a woman's face than any one I have ever seen. "'It was through  Willie St. John that the   -AYE MAR.        349 knowledge came which betrayed John Brown's starving condition. One day, in moving by, I saw him dividing his scanty fare with the man. John Brown refused to take it, but afterward, when he knew that Wilhe had gone and would not return for it, he caught at it with a hungry avidity that made my hunger seem a trifling thing. ; There is no cold so- hard to endure as the sud- den, unexpected cold of a warm climate. A sea- son of chilling, raw weather ended in sharp frosty airs, that to men with just a shadow of food let fall upon them night and morning, was equal to -the severest cold in its effects. It was on one of the coldest of those nights that Willie St. John fell ill. His cries for "water! water!" in his de- lirium rwere harrowing. Men, who would have gone to death rather than humble themselves to beg a favor of their captors, went down on their knees, interceding for water for the boy, and sought in vain. - On my arm he had laid his head, when it hurt him so. His lips, lying near my face, were utter- ing sweet boyish words that had no home in that place; they were of mother, love, and household 'ways that cut their way into the hearts of men, who sometimes seemed to have forgotten every- thing but present use and present want. With every sentence there was-mingled the cry for water. 15'  &#xD;<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC7507-00000177"/> 350        FAYE MAn. One-man started up: 'Boys,' said he, I'm going over the wall. Mind, if I fall, you catch the water for the boy.' "We held our breathing while he climbed the wooden wall; we strained our hearing for a sound after we heard the sliding noise that told the man *was safely down on the outer side. We waited. A hundred eyes were on the edge of the wall, thrown up against the sky in vivid relief, to see the first sign of the return. "An hour must' have passed when he came. His head rose bravely up. His arms were thrown over the edge. He had two rusty canteens filled. A rifle-ball sped too surely on its way. 'Boys!' he cried, before he dropped, ' there's water for Willie.' "We never heard of the man from that hour. Willie St. John cried no more for water. He lay on my arm till day came, then died, as fair a flower as was offered up during those woful years of sacrifice. "Sweet Willie's death! -Why do I so dwell upon it to-night? Is it because I am again watching, waiting for the day to come? "When Wilhe was lifted from my arm, it had done its last work on the earth. The frost had chilled it forever. It died with the child. "The day after Willie died, Isaac came: the day following, my arm was amputated,   FAYE MAR.         351 "I have an untold dread to talk the times over again, but when Isaac returns, if ever, I will nerve myself- to the task.  It shall be done. I will know how he rescued me. All the consciousness I have is of his coming at night and giving me a cooling drink. I slept. When I awakened I was outside forever of that prison, where I havew seen such sights, heard such sounds, witnessed such sufferings, I feared they would darken my reason. As I wrote, gradually the phantoms of horror fled, and in their places came in gentle memories. How ;good God is, that, even in an army prison, no jailor can shut out all comfort, all happiness. ';May the waters of Eternity flow   in on the wheels of Time before our country shall see another civil war!- "There's a newer, stronger tie, gradually draw- ing North and South, East and West together- the tie of common suffering: mutual woes knit hearts together in a bond stronger than joy can weave. "By the   holy light of Suffering; beneath the home altars, where mothers and fathers of North and South have carried up  their offerings, let us live and love together. "It is morning.  Faye is alive-my cup of joy runneth over."   &#xD;</p>
