            <head>PREFACE.</head> 
            <p>IN the design of this romance the outline has been borrowed to a degree from the ancient legend, such portions being selected as were approved or invented by the master minds of antiquity as not irrelevant to the original facts or to the customs, characters, and modes of thought of the age. But the writer has exercised his judgment in adopting only such parts as seemed best fitted to give in a harmonious whole the story of the great pre-Homeric tragedy which shook the shores of the gean, and has ventured to supply any blanks which might occur from his own limited resources. In furtherance of this plan it has been necessary to give some scenes from the "Iliad," but as the action of that poem forms but a brief although an important episode in the lives of Paris and Helen, such persons and scenes have alone been<pb n="iv-v" xml:id="VAC5784-00000003"/> taken from it as bore an immediate relation to the adventures of the chief actors, and then allowed only space proportioned to their importance, and with such freedom as to harmonize them with the remainder of the narrative.</p> 
            <p>Inasmuch as customs in the East, so far as suggested by race and climate, alter but slowly, and remain in most points essentially what they were ages, ago, especially in husbandry and pastoral life, the author hopes that his Levantine observations may have proved of service in illustrating the simplicity which marked the habits of the period in which the scene of the romance is laid, and giving a natural turn to the story.</p> 
            <p>The vagueness of beliefs regarding the problems of our existence which obtained at the time, the relations of man to the supernatural and to a future life, the apparent conflict of the Divine purposes, the notions of fatality which then misguided the conscience, and the like, have been incidentally suggested.</p> 
            <p>A classic style has been neither attempted nor avoided. To strain, after a servile imitation<pb n=""/> tion of the antique in thought and expression would only result in frigidity; wholly to avoid it would be a solecism. The writer has desired to steer a middle course, and has above all things sought to keep in remembrance that the men and women of that day were like the men and women of our time, stirred by like passions and subject alike to the transforming influences of circumstances guided by laws beyond human control. On the other hand he has endeavored to escape the error committed by those who criticise the characters of Homer from too occidental a point of view,-an error which has impaired the value of much that has been written upon the classical ages and literature.</p>

               <p>TROY was the capital town of Troas; and Troas was the country situated in the northwestern corner of Asia Minor, the broad Hellespont bathing its northern shore, and the gean waves breaking against its western coast. Troy, or Ilium, as it was not rarely called, was built on the brow and the slope of a spur of Mount Ida, which extends from that range, and like an outstretched arm lies on the plain between the Simois and Scamander, rivers wont to rise above their banks and inundate the meadows with a tawny flood, when the winter rains fell in the gorges of Ida's wooded mountains. The houses of Troy were, for the most part, constructed of wicker-work filled with sun-dried bricks, and roofed with red tiles or thatch. Divers kinds of<pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC5784-00000006"/> trees grew in the inclosures about the dwellings: chiefly mulberry-trees, bearing black-beaded fruit; pomegranate-trees, whose brilliant green was aflame with scarlet blossoms; broad-leafed fig-trees, homely, but yielding purple figs glistening with summer dew; and sycamores, gigantic and spreading patriarchal arms that bestowed perpetual blessings of grateful shade over the town. Near the centre of the city, where several of the narrow streets crossed each other, a spring of pure water that leaped singing from the rock was caught in its blithesome course, and, caged in a marble fountain, was forced to contribute to the public weal before it was allowed to slip down the sloping street into the plain. Through a spout the foaming water burst impetuously forth into a stone trough with a ceaseless murmuring. There at sunrise and sunset the bray of asses, the low of kine, and the bleat of lambs was heard, and more sweetly and cheerfully still, at all hours rang the merry laugh of white-footed damsels, who bore water-jars thither on rosy shoulders, and tarried long to gossip about their lovers.</p> 
               <p>Walls, lofty and well-built, and surmounted at intervals by towers, surrounded the city, following the slope down to the plain, where stood the principal entrance, called the Scan Gate. In the quarter of Troy nearest the mountains, on an<pb n=""/> eminence, was situated the citadel, called Pergamus. This was inclosed by a wall of its own, forming a fortress of great strength, within which were included the temple of Jupiter Hyrcus, and the palace of the kings of Troy.</p> 
               <p>At the time this story begins, Priam was king. After the death of Arisbe, his first wife, Priam wedded Hecuba, daughter of Dymas, who, in the course of years, bore him nineteen sons and daughters. While they were yet children they sported about the city, or gamboled over the plain, searching for shells on the sea-shore, when the north wind sent the breakers thundering upon the beach; or they rambled through the vineyards and gathered clusters of sparkling grapes, which they eat, seated under the gnarled olive-trees that grew on the banks of the foaming Scamander. As they became older, the boys were taught how to ride horses without saddle, to hurl the javelin at a mark, to hunt the wild boar, and to excel in all manly sports, after the manner of kings' sons. But their sisters, as they grew into maidenhood, were kept in their father's palace with their mother and the slave-women, and learned how to weave and spin, to dye the stuffs they wove, and to make fine needlework. And as one by one the children of Priam married, separate apartments were built for them within the Pergamus, adjoining the royal abode.</p> 
               <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC5784-00000007"/> 
               <p>But Paris, one of the sons of Priam and Hecuba, did not join in these sports and occupations, nor share in the privileges enjoyed by his brothers and sisters. When his mother was pregnant of him, she dreamed on a certain night, that she brought into the world a blazing torch, which consumed Troy, and made it a desolation. A dream of such evil portent could not but leave a deep impression upon her mind; nevertheless, Hecuba hesitated to confide it to her husband, fearing, as well she might, what must be the consequences to the infant if the vision should become known. But the awful responsibility of keeping to herself a matter of such importance finally induced her to divulge it to Priam. He also was profoundly moved by the dream, which seemed to involve, either the death of the child or the fall of Troy. In this dilemma, counsel was sought of sacus, a cunning soothsayer, who, after consulting the omens, declared that this was indeed a warning sent by the gods; nothing less was at stake than the fate of Troy, and only by the death of the unfortunate child could the nation be saved from an otherwise inevitable doom.</p> 
               <p>Under such untoward circumstances was the little waif ushered into the world, condemned to close his eyes in death ere he had accustomed<pb n=""/> them to the light. It availed not that he was a boy of unwonted beauty of shape and feature, vigorous, and worthy of his royal descent; it availed not that his mother, with the agony of delivery still fresh in her memory, prayed for his life with streaming eyes, and that the great heart of Priam himself yearned after the poor infant. Fate, stronger than man, forced them to carry out her decree. But, in order to avoid the actual knowledge of its death and immediate participation in it, and perhaps with an unavowed hope that a faint possibility of life might thus occur, the child was given to a domestic, who was commanded to carry it to the mountains, and there leave it exposed in a basket on a crag. Perchance some dweller of the woods, some oread or wild beast, might suckle and save it. Such things had been and might happen again. But long did the parents mourn for their lost child, fairer at his birth than any of their previous children, and fairer in memory than any that were born to them years and years after he was carried from their sight, and left on the desolate mountain to be a prey for the eagles.</p> 
               <p>But if inexorable Fate had so early deprived the child of his parents, she still preserved his life, in order that the predestined decrees of Heaven concerning Troy be fulfilled. The<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC5784-00000008"/> servant gave the child to a shepherd named Archelaus, commanding him to expose it on a cliff. The shepherd did as directed, but going five days in succession to see if the infant was devoured, found the babe each time suckled by a bear, which retreated growling into the woods at the sight of the man. At length, moved to the soul by the piteous spectacle, the shepherd no longer hesitated what course to adopt, but gently raised the shivering babe to his bosom, and carried it to his hut.</p> 
               <p>The wife of Archelaus, hearing the steps of her husband approaching at an unwonted hour, and the shrill cry of an infant, a strange sound to her childless ear, stepped to the door to meet them, and gladly took the foundling to her arms. Leaving it with her, Archelaus speedily returned to his flock and seizing one of the goats, brought back a pipkin of milk, which the child drank with avidity. The good shepherd and his wife now gladly adopted the little boy for their own, and named him Paris.</p> 
               <p>The hut of this peasant family was a rude structure, whose three sides were constructed of wattled twigs, the crevices being filled with clay. The beetling wall of a low precipice, against which the dwelling stood, served for its fourth side. Rafters fixed in this natural wall and over-laid<pb n=""/> laid with dry branches of the pine and the beech, that were held in their places, when the strong winds blew, by heavy stones, furnished a roof; a fig-tree that had found a bold for its roots among the rock, and had continued its growth almost horizontally, gave additional shelter to the hut when the sun and the rain beat upon it; and a grape-vine of enormous dimensions had gradually extended its loving arms around and over the humble dwelling, and so inclosed it within its firm but tender embrace, that the cabin seemed to have sprung naturally from the moss-green rocks and tangled foliage, a part of which it appeared to be.</p> 
               <p>Wrapped in swaddling bands, the infant who had stolen into the shepherd's hut joyously as a wandering ray of sunshine dropping through a crack in the leafy roof, was carefully tended by his new-found mother. A hammock of sheep-skin was hung from the roof, and when he was fastened into it, he was drawn backwards and forwards by a cord which she held when plying her distaff in the doorway; or he lay by the hour by the side of the hut at her feet, crooning and tossing his little clinched fists. Morning and evening a goat was led up, and on its warm milk little Paris throve and grew apace; and by and by he could totter around alone, holding fast for<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5784-00000009"/> support on the shaggy mane of the great white dog who kept the wolves from the fold. Fierce as a wolf himself, yet the faithful creature never harmed the little boy, but when his hair was twitched too hard by the tiny fingers, only whined and licked the boy's face by way of entreaty for kindlier usage.</p> 
               <p>At sundown the flock came home, Archelaus leading the way with his crook, attended by a long-bearded goat, the patriarch of the flock. The dog walked in the rear to guard the flanks and prevent any of the kids from loitering; the tinkle of bells winding among the rocks announced their approach to the hut, and Paris and his mother then sat in the door waiting for them. Now followed the milking of the goats, after which they were inclosed within their wicker-woven fold. After nightfall the jackalls yelped in the neighboring ravines, and even around the hut, sometimes scampering over the roof; and the little brown owls that roosted in the clefts of the precipice, sailed out in the moonlight, and from their perch in the fig-tree hooted down the wind, but disturbed not the sweet, deep slumber of those who lay in the hut below.</p> 
               <p>One day Archelaus brought Paris a pair of little wolves the size of rabbits, which he had found in the den of a wolf that he and his dog had slain<pb n=""/> that day, when pasturing the goats on the mountain. At another time the shepherd brought him a young crow. These were the lad's playmates. But as they grew older their native wildness, the lawlessness of the woods, became apparent-that untamableness which it is so difficult to eradicate, even from humanity itself. One morning at dawn Paris heard a clamor unwonted in the old fig-tree overhead, and rushing forth, beheld a flock of crows blackening the tree and noisily chattering. But when he hurled a stone at them, and they arose and flew away, what was his mortification to see his young crow, which he recognized by the red cord tied about the neck, also flap its wings and depart. It had found a mate and never returned to the hut; and so it happened with the little wolves. One of them made off with himself, and the other was found with jaws bloody, not far from a kid, on which it was evident he had broken his fast. So the shepherd hung the rogue to a branch by the neck; he was becoming too dangerous a pet.</p> 
               <p>But Paris was also growing larger and stronger, and therefore did not greatly miss his savage companions, for he could now accompany his foster-father to the pastures. The shepherd, gave the boy a long crook, and taught him how to watch the sheep and goats. On his feet Paris<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5784-00000010"/> wore sandals of hide, bound over the instep and about the ankle with thongs; his head was protected by a gray, close-fitting cap of felt, from under which black locks escaped, curling around the temples and the sun-imbrowned neck. In the belt which bound his jerkin around the waist, a rude knife was carried; with this he made himself a bow and arrows, strengthening the former with horn; the bowstring was of sinew; and in time he learned to use these weapons with great skill. From the reeds that grew in dense ranks where a mountain torrent coursed through a marshy glade, Paris selected one having a large-sized tube, and therefrom carved a flute like the syrinx of Apollo. Archelaus showed him how to draw music from the hollow reed, and his own talent soon enabled him to play with exquisite melody, and at midday, as he lay under the shade of a laurel bush or a sycamore, the trill of his pipe was heard far away over the silent valleys, blending with the bells of the browsing sheep and the shrill hum of the cicala.</p> 
               <p>The boy's food on these summer days was black wheaten bread and goat's milk, cheese curd and olives, with grapes, plucked as he passed by the vineyards. But he was happy and contented with this frugal fare; and when he adorned the fleece of his favorite lamb with garlands of wild<pb n=""/> poppies, harebells, and daisies, or bound them around his own forehead, no cares disturbed his bosom, for his wants were few, and he knew not that he was a king's son, and that in Troy, whose towers he sometimes faintly discerned on the plain below among the gray olive-groves, when they caught the horizontal sheen of the rising sun, dwelt his father and mother, and his royal brothers and sisters.</p> 
               <p>The approaching years of manhood inspired the young shepherd with a love for the chase and other manly sports, and gave him the sturdy grace and supple sinews and proportions that enabled him to excel. Often did he fell the spotted pard with his javelin, or following with swift and sure foot the bounding red deer, or the long-horned ibex, as it leaped from rock to rock, pierced it to the heart with the unerring arrow, and bore it to the hut in triumph. Sometimes he joined the shepherds in their games, at evening, or on the festal days of Cybele and Bacchus, and often carried away a kid or a lamb, the prize for success in wrestling, boxing, or foot-racing. It happened now and then that his courage and strength, were put to a severer test. Roving robbers, who lived on what they could filch from the flocks, would sometimes oblige the shepherds to combine and drive them from the region.<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5784-00000011"/> Then it was that Paris became renowned among the shepherds, and was surnamed by them Alexander, or repeller of men.</p> 
               <p>For the most part, however, the life of the youth was solitary, passed in the company of his flocks and herds, on the lonely slopes of Mount Ida. But he was still at an age when the simplicity of youth and the fervor of its warm blood combine to invest existence in ideal hues. The fierce passions of manhood had scarcely waked in his bosom, nor the ambition of the world yet made him discontented with his quiet lot. The vague longings that stirred his soul, if they foretold the approach of the sterner, harsher, stormier period which every man must, in a greater or less degree, encounter, now at least only intensified the keen enjoyment he took in his sylvan and pastoral life, quickened his fancy, and brought him into close sympathy, if not actual relationship, with the invisible around him. He dwelt in an ideal world. In the soul-like music of the pines he recognized the voice of choired wood-nymphs; the warble of the brook that dashed at his feet and chimed with his flute was a naiad's song; fauns passed by when the thickets of dwarf oak rustled and acorns shook to the ground. When the vapor of morning lay on the mountain, gigantic shapes, the gods of the infant<pb n=""/> world, appeared to his vision, and, in the misty light of the harvest moon, he often discerned the white shoulder or flying hair of an oread noiselessly stealing among the moss-covered columns of the mighty temple of the woods. It was when these fancies and realities had wrought upon his character, and prepared him for the purest and highest of human transports, that love came to him, not mere sensual love, but that first love which visits the heart of youth, that divine blending of sentiment and passion with forgetfulness of self in all-absorbing regard for another, which spiritualizes the object of affection, and elevates a young man for the while into a region apart from the gross atmosphere of sense. Seldom is such love twice vouchsafed to a soul, for too often life's experiences materialize the man, and make him incapable of realizing an emotion which the enthusiasm and artlessness of youth render possible.</p> 
               <p>Far up the mountain, where woodmen had made an opening on the edge of the forest, a plane-tree stood alone on a projecting shelf. The lofty, massive trunk, mailed with a coat of speckled white bark, lifted far into the blue a green crest, that often tangled the trailing clouds of dawn in its meshes; but the lowest branches of the old sycamore, a few feet from the ground, stretched<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5784-00000012"/> completely over the little plain with their long-fingered foliage, entirely shutting out the sun from below, except as the quivering of the leaves in the wind allowed stray specks of gold to filter through upon the sward. The tree, in the course of its long growth, had gradually wound one of its gnarled roots over a rock that was half imbedded in the earth. From a cleft in this rock gurgled a spring cool as ice, filling a small pebbly basin that was formed by the sides of the rock, aided by another of the sycamore's twisted roots. In this little pool of crystalline purity the tree above was mirrored; while, through a crevice in the long grass and ferns that fringed its margin, the water continually escaped in a rivulet that slipped silently across the ledge, and trickled over the precipitous edge in silver rain.</p> 
               <p>One May morning, as he entered on this little mead, Paris saw a maiden stealing away into the thicket beyond, but looking back as she disappeared, and revealing to his dazed eyes a countenance of wonderful loveliness. There was henceforth no peace for him until he could discover who she might be, and could make her his own. Often did he seek her at the foot of the plane-tree, and often did he have the keen disappointment of seeing her dart from his view. But at last he succeeded in coming so silently<pb n=""/> upon her that she had not time to elude him. Starting up in haste, she sought to fly, but caught a white foot in the bank of the brook and fell, and Paris, grasping her hand, assisted her to arise. Vainly she strove to withdraw her hand from his grasp. He would not release her until she promised to meet him on the following morning. Looking hastily in his face, then blushing, and dropping her eyes to the ground with artless reserve, the maiden hesitatingly promised that she would come, and then left him to dream of the beauty which had dazzled his eyes and enchained his heart.</p> 
               <p>Interview followed interview between the young shepherd and the nymph, whose name was, in the dialect of the woods, none. She had, it seems, often seen him tending his flocks, and loved the blooming youth, and now had timidly obtained his notice, in the hope of meeting a return of her attachment. Nor was it long before she was willing to accept from him a white fawn, which he had slightly wounded in the chase; and soon she became his bride, and shared with him the rustic, leaf-embowered dwelling he had inherited after the death of his foster-parents, who died in a green old age, leaving all their possessions to Paris.</p> 
               <p>Thus he found in his companion the realization<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5784-00000013"/> tion of his dreams. He needed not to invest her with the hues of fancy to enhance the glory of the golden tresses that showered in her neck, or the azure of her eyes brimming over with innocent mirth, or sometimes suggesting, like the blue sky of noonday, which conceals stars in its depths, the sweet, tender thoughts that lay hidden within them. Her mysterious origin lent a witchery to her charms that distinguished her from any merely human creature, and harmonized with the poetic fancies of the young shepherd's enthusiastic temperament.</p> 
               <p>But not long after this, at the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, to which the gods repaired, Discord, in revenge for being uninvited to the feast, threw a golden apple into the midst of the celestial company, on which was inscribed, "To the fairest." The three goddesses, Her, Pallas, and Aphrodite, each laid particular claim to the shining prize. In the dispute which followed, it was decided that Jove should award the apple to the one of the three whom he should consider the most beautiful. But he discreetly refused the office of umpire, shrewdly considering that Her, being his wife, if he did not give the apple to her would make Olympus too warm for him with her imperious tongue; while, on the other hand, should he let her carry off the prize, he would be<pb n=""/> accused by the other competitors of partiality. Only too glad, therefore, to avoid the dilemma, the crafty god directed the three goddesses to seek Paris, a handsome young shepherd of Mount Ida, who would settle the question for them. They found Paris by the spring under his favorite plane-tree, playing on his reed pipe, while none was gone in search of her fawn, which had strayed away into the thicket, destroyed, as she feared, by a wild beast.</p> 
               <p>A peacock, the attendant of Her, flying in advance, and alighting in a branch overhead, caused the young man to cease his rustic music to admire the magnificent bird; but scarcely had he fixed his eyes upon it ere a pair of white doves, the precursors of Aphrodite, flew into the leafy arena, followed by a russet owl, the faithful servitor of Pallas, who concealed himself in the thickest of the foliage, whence only his large eyes were to be seen staring in the direction from which three female forms of surpassing loveliness now appeared, treading airily over the grass and diffusing hyacinthine odors around them.</p> 
               <p>Amazed and abashed by the dazzling spectacle, and perceiving from the well-known symbolic birds, that these beautiful women were of divine origin, Paris stood stupefied and dumb in confusion, until Her, coming up to him and holding<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5784-00000014"/> out a white hand with the golden apple, said to him, with a winning smile, "Behold, Paris, this apple of gold which Jove said you would award to the one of our number whom you think the most beautiful. Take it, my handsome shepherd, and do not hesitate to consider well whatever charms we may possess, before you decide to whom you will give it." Paris took the apple, having now regained his presence of mind; the consciousness that for the time he occupied a new station, and held in his grasp a novel and wonderful power, nerved him to gaze fearlessly into the faces that as fearlessly confronted his, and to survey their celestial charms with eager eyes.</p> 
               <p>Apparently, he was at last on the point of coming to a decision, looking quickly from one to the other, as if to assure himself against error, when Her, doubtful of his choice, said again, "I do not ask you, Paris, to give the apple to me, unless it is really your sincere opinion that it should be mine. But I will add, that if you should candidly consider me worthy of receiving the apple, I will make you ruler over a noble kingdom, the possessor of wealth, and the controller of men."</p> 
               <p>Before he could act on this alluring proposal, however, Pallas opened her rosy lips, and addressing Paris with an air of confidence in her<pb n=""/> success, said, "I would not for a moment arrogate to myself greater beauty than belongs to Her, the spouse of Jove; but as it is possible that your opinion of beauty may differ from mine, I will say, my Paris, without intending in the least to sway your judgment, that if, after mature deliberation you should concede the apple to me, I will so control your destiny that you shall become the wisest of men, and the greatest warrior of your time."</p> 
               <p>Immediately after came Aphrodite, with taper fingers waving back the golden tresses from her forehead, and white and fair as when she sprung naked from the foam of the sea; looking Paris full in the eye, with a voluptuous smile that sent a flame through his heart, a thrill of unutterable rapture, she warbled in the most delicious tones, "My dear Paris, I doubt not what will be the decision of a young man adapted, like you, to love and to receive love. My companions have sought to bribe you with the promise of the most splendid gifts in their power. But I, knowing the vanity of mere earthly possessions and talents, and the supreme worth of love, and conscious that you will award the golden apple to me, swear to bestow on you the most beautiful of the daughters of men. Have I not rightly judged what would be best pleasing to you? is<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5784-00000015"/> not this apple mine?" said Aphrodite, in a softly pleading and irresistible tone, placing one hand tenderly on his shoulder, and the other on the apple resting in his right palm. Yes, she had thought right; Paris let the prize slip from his hand into her grasp. Immediately Her and Pallas exclaimed, "Rustic hind, you shall live to rue this day! you shall live to see whether Aphrodite can do as much for you as we might have done!" and with a frown on their beautiful faces, they strode majestically away; while Aphrodite said, "Fear not, my Paris, my promise shall be sacredly kept; wait patiently, and ere many years, you shall be fitly rewarded for your impartial choice," and, exhaling perfume from her gossamer-like veil, she vanished from his sight.</p> 
               <p>When Paris reflected on what had passed, although intoxicated by the beauty on which he had gazed, the temporary power which he had wielded, and the promised delights in store for him, he could not avoid a lurking uneasiness; for, although he had been allowed entire liberty to choose between the three goddesses, yet in electing to accept the offer of Aphrodite, he incurred, with the pleasure it brought, the no less certain wrath of divinities as able to send penalty as reward. A sigh from the underwood behind him smote on his ear, like the voice of an<pb n=""/> accusing monitor, and made him still further doubt the wisdom and uprightness of his choice. It was none, who now brought him back to the realities of his present life by her sobs. Returning to the spring just as the three goddesses appeared to Paris, she had remained hidden, to observe what would be the result of the interview. She heard the proposals made to him, and awaited his choice with the most intense and jealous anxiety. But when Aphrodite approached him with her blandishments, none felt that superhuman influence alone could enable him to resist the all-powerful goddess. Vainly the nymph strove to warn him; so great was her emotion that it stifled the cry on her lips, and in a moment the decision was reached, Paris was again alone, and none felt that her fate was sealed; since, unsatisfied with her charms, Paris would now look and wait impatiently for a fairer than his wood-nymph bride, one who would steal away his heart from virtue and wedded love.</p> 
               <p>Weeping and moaning, none now appeared before him, reproaching him for preferring even the promise of any other woman to her, whom he had vowed always to love. Then Paris sought to comfort her, arguing that Aphrodite, having obtained the apple, would now forget her promise<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5784-00000016"/> to a poor shepherd, and that he and none would always live together on Mount Ida. Shaking her head doubtfully, and trying to smile through her tears, she finally yielded to the effect of his pacifying words, and Paris then thought her as lovely as Aphrodite herself.</p> 
               <p>For months after this Paris contentedly tended his flocks and herds, chased the wild panther, or trod the grapes in vintage time, and with red-stained ankles pressed the ruby juice into wine. But, in the mean time, King Priam in Troy appointed a day on which his sons and other noble young men of the city should contend in athletic games, the prize for the winner in the greatest number of games to be the finest bull on Mount Ida. For this purpose Priam sent men to search for such a bull, and after inspecting several herds, the men finally came to Paris, and told him that the king had commanded them to seek out the finest bull on Mount Ida, and it was now his turn to show them his cattle. To this demand Paris was unable to make resistance. As it happened, the men found such a bull as they desired among his herds, a noble animal, black as night, with eyes that shot fire, and a throat whose bellow made the woods ring again. They all agreed that this was by far the noblest bull they had seen, and Paris was summoned to give him up.<pb n=""/> To this he agreed, on condition that he should be allowed to take part in the games, and retain a chance of winning back the bull. After some consultation, the condition was granted, and a noose being thrown over the animal's horns, he was dragged to a stout tree and made fast; his legs being then bound together, he was thrown heavily on his side, and a hole was bored through his nostrils; through this a ring was passed, to which a chain was attached, and the bull was led off to Troy.</p> 
               <p>So at last Paris was to leave his mountain home, and for the first time in his life was to visit the town and mingle with jostling crowds. Fate seemed determined to tear him from his quiet and innocent existence, resolved that as he entered the years of manhood he should not escape its stormy passions, temptations, and vicissitudes. Whilst he was musing on his contemplated journey to Troy, reposing on the grass under the plane-tree, his reed pipe lying loosely in his listless grasp, and his flock of spring lambs cropping the tender herbage around him, he perceived the pleasant voice of none calling him by name as she returned from a woodland ramble, and then he heard the pattering of her fawn's feet on the dry twigs and spires that carpeted the ground under the pine groves, on the upper slope. Soon<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5784-00000017"/> she was at his side, holding up before his eyes a large double cluster of purple grapes, whose juice had stained the tips of her fingers, while, with a smile which showed her teeth between the parted lips like the shining rows of pearly fruit in a cloven pomegranate, she called his attention to a string of coral-like berries which she had hung around her own neck, and a garland of daphn that adorned the favorite fawn.</p> 
               <p>At the sight of the wood-nymph, Paris almost repented his resolution to leave her, even for the short period in which he was to visit Troy, for he intuitively feared that, after his return, the relations between them would be more or less impaired. But he did not hesitate long to declare to none his intention of starting for Troy on the morrow, to contend with the noblest for the prize. A cold shudder came over her when Paris spoke of his proposed journey; she too perceived what a change for them both must result from the event; a sad foreboding weighed down her gentle heart. The crisis of her happiness had evidently arrived. But all the entreaties of none were in vain, and as Paris solemnly vowed to return to her as speedily as the games were over, she ceased to urge him any longer to give up the plan, and busied herself in making what little preparations were needed, making an effort, meanwhile, to be<pb n=""/> cheerful so long as her young shepherd was with her.</p> 
               <p>On the following morning, while it was yet dawn, and while the cold white mists lay sleeping in the gorges below, and only the extreme tips of the mountain peaks were fired by the rosy flush of the yet unrisen sun, the morning-star still blazing in the serene eastern sky, Paris leaped lightly from his sheepskin couch; after trimming his hair carefully, he placed in his girdle a pair of new sandals, and fastened a quiver of arrows to his shoulder, and a wallet containing coarse bread and olives. In his hand he carried a bow and a stout ashen staff. none accompanied him to the plane-tree. There, in that scene of such happiness in former days, the presentiment that she was now about to lose him so strongly seized upon her that she clasped his knees, and with agonizing entreaties besought him not to leave her. She was like the pure spirit of youth imploring him not to forsake the simplicity and quiet happiness of early life for the tempestuous career which allures the soul of man, restless and ambitious, too often to its ruin.</p> 
               <p>But her entreaties availed not. Fondly kissing none and gently chiding her distrust in his love and her foolish fears, as he called them, Paris bade her a tender farewell, saying that by<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5784-00000018"/> the fourth day at furthest he would be with her again. And then he tore himself from her arms, and started down the mountain. none stood on the edge of the little plat and watched his retreating form through a mist of tears, until he was entirely lost to view in the woods below. Many years passed before she saw him again.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <head>II.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE SHEPHERD BECOMES A PRINCE.</head> 
               <p>FOLLOWING for the most part the course of a mountain torrent, walking on the white stones and glistening sand of the bed, through the middle of which only a narrow, thread-like stream now trickled slowly down, Paris by sunset reached the lower slopes and the commencement of the barley fields. There he slept in the hut of one who watched the vineyards; but he was up again at cock-crow, and rapidly continued his journey over undulating lands covered with waving grain, interwoven with daisies and scarlet poppies sparkling with dew. When the sun was high and shone full on the battlements of Troy, Paris' heart beat quickly as he for the first time approached the city which he had hitherto only discerned gleaming through the blue haze of distance, and began to realize that he, a shepherd youth, was about to contend in games of strength and skill with tried heroes before King Priam himself. But he controlled the fears which<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5784-00000019"/> abashed him at the thought of his hardihood in venturing to enter the sports, and boldly pushed on to the Scan Gate, where a lively scene met his eyes.</p> 
               <p>A number of venerable, white-headed men, the elders of the city, in flowing robes and holding staves in their hands, sat within the cool shade of the gate on marble seats, conversing in measured language comporting with the gravity of years, superintending the passage of men and beasts of burden through the gate, and adjusting any little difficulties that occurred among the citizens. An incessant stream of people, men and boys, were passing out from the city to the part of the plain assigned to the games. After a time, King Priam appeared in a chariot carved and gilded, and drawn by two milk-white steeds. He stood erect in the chariot, supporting himself by a massive spear, whose burnished metallic point flashed in the morning sun like a star. His arms were bare, but a purple tunic hung from the shoulders, and his venerable features wore a benignant expression as he cast his eyes over the moving throngs, who sent up a shout when the horses, urged on by the driver, bowled the chariot easily over the plain. On a little knoll that overlooked the mountains, the city, and the sea, a throne of marble had been placed for the king, and there he alighted.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>When Priam had taken his seat, a space below was cleared, and several of his sons and a number of other youths and chiefs of noble birth came forward to engage in the contests for the prizes, of which the most valuable, the black bull belonging to Paris, was destined for the winner in the largest number of the games. The chariot race was the first in order. Five chariots, each drawn by two horses and driven by the competitors themselves, entered the course, which extended to the tomb of an ancient warrior, a mile away, and back. The chariots of neas and of Hector, the son of Priam, soon distanced the others, and the race lay between them. The steeds of neas were perhaps the swiftest, and gradually gained on Hector's; but Hector by superior address contrived to obtain the lead, and adroitly taking a rougher but shorter path, came in the winner of the race.</p> 
               <p>Paris up to this time had been only a looker-on with the crowd, as he had no chariot to drive, nor even the experience necessary in charioteering. But when the foot-race followed, and the competitors were called out, he also advanced into the arena and claimed his right to run with the others.</p> 
               <p>"Clown!" cried Hector, rudely thrusting him aside, "how darest thou think to race with<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5784-00000020"/> kings' sons; go back to thy herds, thou milksop, and thank the gods that no worse treatment has come upon thee for thine impudence."</p> 
               <p>"Son of Priam," replied Paris as calmly as he could, "it is true that I am but a simple herdsman of Mount Ida; but the gods made me a man like you; have I not arms and legs, sinews and muscles like unto you? have I not a soul to desire the manly contest? and yet more, have I not the right to seek to win back my own black bull, the noblest prize on the Trojan plain? Ask these men, your royal father's servants, who took the bull from my herd, if I did not receive from them permission to strive in these games as the condition on which I would allow them to carry away my bull."</p> 
               <p>"It is even so, my lord Hector," said one of the servants, stepping forward.</p> 
               <p>"Wretch," cried Hector, "who bade thee speak! hold thy tongue till thou art asked to wag it!"</p> 
               <p>The clamor of wrangling voices attracted the attention of Priam, who, arising majestically, said, "Peace, ye brawlers! Son Hector, it is indeed, true that this permission was, in an evil moment, granted to this neatherd. But be not disturbed. He will learn that rustics compete in vain with heroes. And thou, whatever be thy<pb n=""/> name, who hast dared to make conditions with royalty, enter the lists, and know that we break no promises; but if, when the games are over, thou tarriest on the plains of Troy after yonder sun has gone down behind the sea, my servants shall flay thee alive and throw thy carcass to the dogs."</p> 
               <p>The decision of Priam was final, and the racers, ten in number, having been ranged in a line, started at a given word, like arrows from a bow, and raising a cloud of white dust around their heads. After rounding the goal, on the return, the crowd discerned, far in front of all the others, Hector and Paris abreast. A universal shout rose from the vast multitude. Intense excitement shook every bosom, which found vent in half-stifled murmurs of applause and surprise, when Paris bounded forward and reached the starting-point five paces in advance of Hector.</p> 
               <p>The match for archery was next announced; the mark was a white pigeon secured by a thong to the end of a lofty pole fixed upright in the ground. The archers advanced and in turn let fly at the fluttering bird. All were unsuccessful in hitting the mark, until Deiphobus, one of Priam's sons, grazed the dove's plumage, and sent a feather or two down the wind. Then followed Hector, whose shaft clove the thong and the dove<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5784-00000021"/> flew away; but ere it had quite sped out of bow-shot, Paris pierced its heart with his arrow, and it fell lifeless at his feet.</p> 
               <p>"Well done!" shouted the spectators; and even King Priam said to his attendants, "Methinks this rustic must be some god in disguise, so well does he strive with our Trojan lads;" but Hector's brow was like a thunder-cloud.</p> 
               <p>Last of all came the wrestling match, and Hector stepping forward, looked around with confident mien, as if he would say, "Dares this lout wrestle with me, the champion of Troy and the son of Priam." All held back, in order to allow Paris opportunity to accept the challenge, fixing their eyes on him in wondering expectation. He hesitated not, but walking up to Hector said, in a quiet tone, "I will wrestle with you, noble Hector."</p> 
               <p>At once the two champions grappled, planting their feet in the earth and grasping each other's shoulders as with clamps of iron. The one burned to avenge his defeats, the other was as strongly bent on winning back his bull, and, above all, on completing the glorious day's sport by a final and personal victory over his formidable antagonist. The contest was long and doubtful. The muscles of the wrestlers stood out in bunches, their backs were purple with the wales left by<pb n=""/> their tremendous grip; not a word was uttered by the spectators; all looked on in breathless suspense. King Priam leaned forward in his seat, one hand on his knee, and his head stretched out, intently watching the struggle. At last, by a sudden movement, Hector succeeded in raising Paris from his feet and was in the act of throwing him, when Paris dexterously caught his foot between Hector's ankles and tripped him up. Hector fell heavily on his back, Paris falling uppermost and pinning him to the earth.</p> 
               <p>A tremendous shout rang over the plains of Troy from thousands of throats, and did not cease until Priam, rising and advancing a few steps to the edge of the knoll, stretched forth his hand over the multitude. Then the shouting ceased; and Priam said,-</p> 
               <p>"Bring forward the victor."</p> 
               <p>Paris advanced, and Priam continued, "Thou hast well done, rustic youth. Far be it from us to harm such as thee, for perchance a god has assisted thee; and furthermore, Priam knows how to appreciate and reward such manhood as thine. Take thy black bull, which is now doubly thine, and depart to thy mountain home. But shouldst thou weary of guarding flocks, remember that Priam is thy friend, and return to Troy. When that day comes, a chieftain's place awaits thee<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5784-00000022"/> among our chosen troop of warriors. Go, my son, in peace!"</p> 
               <p>Paris bent to the ground, and kissed the hem of Priam's robe with grateful reverence: but when he arose, and, amid the applause of the multitude, approached the bull to lead him away, he was met by Hector, who, having snatched a spear and a sword from a bystander, now threatened Paris should he attempt to lay hands on the prize.</p> 
               <p>"Now, rustic upstart, we shall see whether thou canst guard the prize which they pretend to say thou hast won!"</p> 
               <p>"O Hector!" replied Paris, "the bull has been rightfully won, and, in obedience to thy royal father's bidding, I shall now lead it back to my herds."</p> 
               <p>"No, by almighty Jove, while Hector lives thou bearest not away the prize! this spear shall transfix thee, unless thou givest up at once all claim to the bull."</p> 
               <p>The menacing attitude of Hector, who held the spear pointed at Paris, caused Paris, who was totally unarmed, to recoil, while Hector followed him up closely. Hector's fury knew no bounds, and before he could be checked by the bystanders he hurled the spear at Paris, who evaded it, and it harmlessly hissed by his ear. Immediately after the missile came Hector, a two-edged<pb n=""/> sword in hand, which he was about to plunge into the bosom of the unprotected herdsman; but Paris was too quick for him, and darted toward the city gates at full speed, Hector being in hot pursuit. They flew through the Scan Gate, and Paris, being the swiftest, and impelled by the love of life, gained on his pursuer sufficiently to be able to observe a temple at the head of the street which led to the Scan Gate. With the dogs of the neighborhood snapping at his heels, Paris rushed for the temple, darted up the steps, and through the open door, until at the further end he reached the altar, where they were offering a sacrifice, and falling on his knees, grasped the altar horns with both hands. Hector entered but a few steps behind him, and heedless of the position of suppliant which Paris had assumed, raised the glittering blade in act to strike, when Cassandra, the eldest daughter of Priam and priestess of the temple, grasped his uplifted arm, exclaiming,-</p> 
               <p>"Hold, sacrilegious man! would you call down the vengeance of Heaven on Troy? Not with impunity does he escape who slays a suppliant whose hands have hold of the sacred altar horns of the gods!"</p> 
               <p>Brought to his senses by this timely warning, and aghast at his narrow escape from an act of<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5784-00000023"/> impiety which would have brought ruin on the perpetrator, Hector dropped the sword, and stood silent, while Cassandra, tall and majestic in white robes, and an expression of pity tempering the wrath that burned in her eagle eyes, asked Paris how he came to be there. In a few words he related the events of the day. While he spoke, Cassandra watched his countenance closely, and then gazed alternately on his face and on Hector's. She looked perplexed, as if she vaguely traced a resemblance between the two faces before her.</p> 
               <p>"You said that you were a herdsman of Mount Ida?" she inquired.</p> 
               <p>"Even so."</p> 
               <p>"Who was thy father?"</p> 
               <p>"Archelaus, the shepherd, was my foster-father; he found me in a basket on a crag, suckled by a she bear; so he told me ere he died."</p> 
               <p>"Great gods, it is even as I thought," replied the good Cassandra, whose prophetic gift had assisted in the recognition of Paris. "Hector, our brother Paris, who was exposed on Mount Ida, is found. This is he whom your cruel sword would have slain so unjustly. My brothers, be this hour of recognition the hour of your reconciliation!"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Astonished at the turn which affairs had taken, Hector advanced towards the youth whom but a few moments before he was raging to slay; Paris also arose from the steps of the altar, and the two brothers embraced and kissed each other. By this time some of the foremost of the spectators of the games, who had seen the sudden flight and pursuit, and had hastily followed, began to enter the temple. But when, instead of beholding Paris lying on the pavement a mangled corpse, they saw the brothers embracing and amicably conversing with each other, they could scarce believe their senses.</p> 
               <p>Hand in hand the brothers now proceeded out of the temple and down the street, towards the Scan Gate, in quest of their father. At the gate they met him hastening into Troy in his chariot, anxious to check the rage of Hector, and to save Paris, in whom he had already taken lively interest. Great was Priam's relief, and at the same time his amazement, to behold them approaching him in such a fraternal manner. The royal chariot was stopped, and Hector briefly related to his father what had happened in the temple. Unmindful of the soothsayer's prophecy regarding Paris, and rejoiced to find that in this young man, who had on this day displayed such rare and noble qualities, he saw the son whom<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5784-00000024"/> he had long ago considered as devoured by the ravens and the wolves, King Priam leaped from the chariot and clasped the shepherd youth to his bosom, shedding tears of joy.</p> 
               <p>Through the gate poured the wondering throngs, and when they learned of the discovery just made, and saw Priam embracing Paris, acclaims long and deafening rang through the streets of Troy, summoning the women and children to their lattices and doors to see what might be the cause of such unwonted commotion. Then, as they comprehended who Paris was, with a sudden frenzy of enthusiasm, the crowd rushed forward, and snatching him from the ground raised him bodily on their shoulders, and bore him to the Pergamus, where the palace of Priam was situated. Hearing the sound of the approaching multitude, Queen Hecuba and her daughters stood anxiously at the palace gates, conjecturing what could mean the cries that rang from street to street, "Long life to Paris!" "Long life to King Priam!"</p> 
               <p>Surging into the palace courts like an ocean tide, the crowd carried young Paris to the door where his mother stood. Such was the din and confusion, that it was some moments before she could be made to understand that this blushing, handsome youth had not only been the victor of<pb n=""/> the games on that day, but was also the infant who twenty years before had been snatched from her arms to be exposed on Mount Ida. But when she at last understood and believed that this was truly her long lost son, touching it was indeed to see with what tenderness she kissed him on his mouth and his eyes, and caressed him with all a mother's affection in her manner blended with the dignified bearing of a queen, no longer young but yet stately and beautiful.</p> 
               <p>Great was the joy in the city of Troy and in the palace of Priam that night. All seemed to forget the prediction made at the birth of Paris, that he would prove the ruin of the Trojan kingdom. The skill and manly bearing which had been the means of bringing him again to the notice of his family, made them proud as well as glad to own him as a son, a brother, and a citizen. Brightly flashed the torches in the palace halls; many were the sheep and swine roasted and devoured that night. Fast flowed the red wine, and merry were the strains of viol, timbrel, and flute. When the sounds of festivity at length ceased, Paris shared the couch of Hector, both sleeping on the same tiger's skin.</p> 
               <p>On the following morning, King Priam, after attending the morning sacrifice at the temple of Jupiter Hercaus, within the inclosure of the Pergamus<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5784-00000025"/> gamus, and pouring out libations for a prosperous day, said to Paris, "Son of my old age, henceforth thy home is with us. No more shalt thou tend the flocks and herds on Ida's slopes; but thou shalt don the helmet and carry in thy hand a barbed spear instead of the shepherd's crook. And lo, this day my cunning workmen shall commence to hew timber and carve stone to build for thee a hall next to the halls of my other sons and daughters, for to each of them are assigned noble chambers; and thou shalt fight in the wars of Troy and become renowned."</p> 
               <p>To this Paris replied, "Royal father, I must first go back to Mount Ida and meet my wife, none, as I agreed to do when I left her to come here. I will also sell my flocks and herds, or find men honest and suitable to guard them for me. Having so done, I will then return to Troy, bringing none with me to share my good fortune, if it be pleasing to thee, O my father."</p> 
               <p>"As for thy flocks and herds," replied King Priam, "have no trouble. I will send competent men, who by thy direction shall tend them for you as you deem fit. But who is none? Doubtless a rustic of low descent, who would be much happier remaining where she is, and would ere long find another swain to keep her company."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"No, by Jove! she is a wood nymph, pure and beautiful as the star of dawn."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, a wood nymph! so much the better; for, do you not see, my son, that born of the woods, she could not live away from them down here in the city? and she surely could not ask you to forsake your parents and station for her alone; and furthermore, being of such a nature, none will readily find solace for your absence in her native woods, and will easily fix her affection on some other shepherd who can, with less sacrifice than you, consent to tarry with her a lifetime. At any rate, it is best you remain here a while, and then, if you must, return to Mount Ida for none, and bring her to Troy, if she be true to you still."</p> 
               <p>As Priam spoke as he sincerely believed, and therefore with earnestness, his words carried a certain conviction to the mind of Paris; who, while conscious that he knew better than Priam what should be done in the circumstances, was but too ready to be dissuaded from the right. Since no immediate harm seemed apparent from delaying in Troy a little longer than first planned, he indefinitely postponed his return to none, although fully intending to do so within a few days at furthest. As was naturally to be expected, however, Paris soon became so absorbed<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5784-00000026"/> in the pursuits and entertainments of his princely station in a bustling city that he seldom or never thought of the poor wood nymph pining forlorn on Mount Ida,-sometimes fearing that harm had come to him, at other times imagining what was worse still, that he lived and had forgotten her. He had left behind him in his pastoral home the innocence of youth, and with it the love for simple and natural delights, until to his volatile nature it seemed a little thing for him to forget his woodland bride.</p>

               <head>III.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE HEIRESS TO A KINGDOM.</head> 
               <p>WHILE these events were occurring in Troy, as narrated, other events destined to bear an important relation to them, were also taking place in Sparta, a city beyond the gean Sea, in the south of Hellas. Sparta was the chief town of Tyndarus, king of Laconia. Leda was the wife of Tyndarus, and to them were born twin sons, Castor and Pollux, and two daughters, Clytemnstra and Helen. From the first Helen was remarkable for the beauty of her form and features, and the piercing expression that flashed in her black eyes. In her childhood she gamboled with her sister and brothers among the dense olive groves that covered the plain of Sparta, or rambled with them along the banks of the swift Eurotas, which rushed limpid and cool between the rustling reeds and the luxuriant oleanders that scented the air on its shores. They were a harmonious, blithesome family, little troubled as yet by their heritage of station and beauty, or by the<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5784-00000027"/> thought of the stormy, passionate lives that were to make them famous. But the years, the inevitable remorseless years came, that stripped these royal children of their innocent, happy childhood, and gave to them instead feverish ambitions and restless yearnings. The brothers found vent for their growing energies in training young colts, attending the hunters in the chase of the wild boar up the rugged sides of snowy Taygetus, or aiding their royal father in repelling the incursions of hostile bands, who sometimes stole through the mountain passes and bore away from Laconia the flocks and herds and the fairest of the maidens. And for fear of these roving adventurers, and because, too, they were now of an age to acquire the accomplishments of womanhood, the two sisters were taught to keep more within their father's abode, devoting themselves to weaving and spinning instead of dreaming and dancing under the plane-trees; except when, with their attendant slave girls, they resorted to the banks of the Eurotas to bleach their clothes, beating them on the white, flat rocks, and merrily blending their laughter with the roaring of the foaming river.</p> 
               <p>Helen increased in beauty every year, and while still a mere child of ten summers, possessed in a degree the mature charms of womanhood.<pb n=""/> Already tall, exquisitely shaped, and graceful as Aglaia herself, Helen, by her precocious loveliness, attracted the wonder of all who beheld her; she became renowned throughout Laconia, and more than one old crone shook her head and muttered that the possession of such beauty must bring with it dissension and trouble. Leda was now dead, but Electra, Helen's nurse and foster-mother, watched her foster-child with all the tenderness of a mother, and jealously guarded her from mischief. It was in the twelfth year of the maiden's life, on the day when the Spartan virgins celebrated the annual feast of Artemis, and went in procession to the temple of the goddess without the walls of Sparta, that Theseus, an Athenian hero, accompanied by his bosom friend Pirithous, and a chosen troop of freebooters, happened to be making a predatory incursion through Arcadia and Laconia. Almost without warning they dashed up to the very walls of Sparta, at the hour when the virgins were returning from sacrificing at the shrine of Artemis. At sight of the strange horsemen emerging out of the woods, the maidens scattered and fled in all directions: this was the signal for Theseus and his comrades to pursue them. Theseus overtook Helen, and leaping to the ground snatched her up and lifted her on the horse; then remounting, and<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5784-00000028"/> holding the screaming, struggling girl fast in his arms,he ordered his men to follow him on the way homeward; for by this time the alarm had been communicated to the city, and King Tyndarus, hastily collecting his household servants and retainers, was sallying from the gates to the rescue. A few who were in the rear of the retreating troop were cut off, but the leaders, with the young Helen, made good their escape through Arcadia and across the isthmus of Corinth to Attica. There Helen was placed by Theseus in charge of his mother, thra, until such time as she should be of marriageable age. But soon the smoke of burning villages and olive groves betokened the approach of King Tyndarus with his sons, Castor and Pollux, and an army of Spartans, chafing like wounded lions. Such was the mischief done by the invaders that the Athenians forced Theseus to withdraw Helen from his mother's care and restore her to Tyndarus, and afterwards sent him into exile for bringing so great misfortunes on the state by his ill-starred expedition to Laconia.</p> 
               <p>The tale of the capture and rescue of Helen was noised abroad, so that while she was still of tender age, the fame of the maiden was sung by wandering minstrels around the festive board of all the chiefs of Hellas; nor was her name allowed<pb n=""/> lowed to pass from memory, for with the ripening of her charms the Spartan princess became still more celebrated as the most incomparable woman of the age. Many were the kings and heroes dwelling in Greece at this time, and of those who were unmarried each became smitten with the desire to win Helen for his bride. Another circumstance stimulated the ardor of the suitors in seeking to obtain Helen. Her twin brothers were now dead, both wandering in the shades below, by untimely fate snatched from the cheerful light of the upper world, and her sister, Clytemnstra, was already espoused to Agamemnon, king of Mycen. Helen was therefore the declared heiress to her father's kingdom, and whoever should marry her would have, in addition to a beautiful wife, a powerful dominion. A more tempting prize has rarely been offered to the ambition of grasping mortals than this combination of what mankind are agreed in considering the most to be desired of earthly possessions.</p> 
               <p>It is not surprising, then, that the hand of Helen, the daughter of Tyndarus, was sought by the princes of Greece, and that they went to Sparta to present their suit in person. Some of them were young, others aged; some were handsome, others repulsive; some relied for success upon their renown for heroic deeds, some on their<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5784-00000029"/> reputed wisdom; some were adventurers, penniless and landless, trusting to fickle Fortune to favor them; others, destitute of personal merits, advanced wealth and power to support their claim. In a word, the brainless and the wise, the shrewd and the simple, the poor and the rich, youth and age, alike swarmed in the halls of Tyndarus, and sued for his daughter.</p> 
               <p>If Helen had been left to consult her own inclinations in the matter, it might not have been so difficult, perhaps, to fix upon the successful suitor. But, unhappily, each of them was so unreasonable as to think his own claims superior to the claims of his rivals, and was ready to pick a quarrel with whoever should be preferred to him, as well as to fight with King Tyndarus himself, the destined father-in-law. Every week heralds announced the arrival of a new suitor, who speedily clattered into the palace inclosure attended by a retinue of horses and attendants. Day and night it was one long carousal in the halls of Tyndarus. Many were the sheep, beeves, and fat swine roasted and devoured, many the wine-skins emptied by the reveling guests and their servants; many were the drunken brawls which the men of Lacedmon had to quell in the lanes of Sparta. The suitors at last became so jealous of each other and so impatient of the<pb n=""/> delay, that it needed but a little spark to set them on fire, or, in other words, to make them fall to cleaving each others' throats, pillaging the town of Sparta, and sending King Tyndarus himself to Hades. Such, indeed, were their threats, and doubtless they would have done as they said, if, at this crisis of affairs, Ulysses, king of Ithaca, had not opportunely appeared.</p> 
               <p>Although still a young man, Ulysses had already won a name for shrewdness, rare even for one older in years. Immediately on reaching Sparta, his keen eye discerned that amid such a multitude of suitors for the hand of Helen, his own chance of success was exceedingly slight; less even than that of some who were inferior to him in possessions and intellect; for he perceived that a young maiden like Helen would be far more likely to prefer some needy coxcomb, with handsome face and person, to men of less showy but more solid endowments. But Ulysses wasted little regret upon the meagreness of his prospect for success at the court of Tyndarus, because, on fording the Eurotas before entering the city, he had met Penelope, the niece of Tyndarus and cousin of Helen, washing clothes with her maidens, on the river banks, among the oleanders. Charmed with her fresh and modest beauty, Ulysses stopped to inquire of her the path<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5784-00000030"/> to Sparta, and thereby gained opportunity to chat with her awhile. The sweetness and good sense of her address won upon his heart, and while she was yet speaking, love for her, enduring as life, sprung up in his soul. This being the case, when Ulysses saw the dilemma into which Tyndarus had fallen concerning the suitors, he concluded to turn it to his own advantage in securing from Tyndarus the promise of Penelope for wife. Accordingly, some days after arriving in Sparta, Ulysses obtained a private interview with his royal host, in which he took occasion to renounce all intention of laying suit to Helen; this was doubtless a relief to Tyndarus, who thus was freed, as he thought, from one who, he was aware, was well able to create trouble if rejected. Ulysses then stated, that on consideration of the matter in which all at Sparta were then so deeply absorbed, he was convinced that he had found a way for the settlement of the question to the satisfaction of all concerned; and that he would explain his plan to Tyndarus if Tyndarus would promise in return to allow Penelope to go to Ithaca.</p> 
               <p>Tyndarus, confident in the wisdom and penetration of Ulysses, gladly consented to a condition so easy to make and so easy to break,-as perhaps he thought he would like to do if he<pb n=""/> should not choose to accept the plan of the Ithacan. But Ulysses, who knew that the word of kings is of little value, not because they are naturally greater liars than other men, but because they can break their promises with more impunity, was not satisfied with a promise alone; he feared that Tyndarus, after he had heard the plan stated, might find some excuse for avoiding his condition of the agreement, especially if the scheme did not prove successful. Therefore, taking heed in all courtesy not to touch the honor of his host, by appearing to suspect the value of his mere word, Ulysses, the wiliest of Greeks, suggested that it might be as well for both parties that Tyndarus should strengthen his promise by a very solemn and terrible oath, wherein he called on all the gods to hurl vengeance on his head if he failed to give his niece Penelope to Ulysses for wife.</p> 
               <p>Tyndarus, after some hesitation, took the oath, and Ulysses then made known his design, which was, in fine, that Tyndarus should assemble all the suitors for the hand of Helen and urge them to allow her peacefully to choose one from their number, and that they should swear in addition to defend her husband in his possession of her, and fight for her rescue, in case any one should carry her off again.</p> 
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5784-00000031"/> 
               <p>When Ulysses had ended the explanation of his plan, it seemed so exceedingly simple, that Tyndarus laughed a scornful laugh, and jeeringly said, "Is this all you have to say, O Ulysses? I do not wonder you have earned a reputation for wisdom, if you have won it by such airy counsels. Now I know why you were so very anxious to have me swear by Jove and by Apollo to give you my niece. But, by Jove and by Apollo, you shall not steal away my fair ward so easily. What opinion can you have of my character if you think to overreach me by so shallow an artifice?"</p> 
               <p>"Say no more about your niece, O Tyndarus," replied Ulysses. "If you, a king of Lacedmon, do not care to keep your oaths, I can do without her far better than you can endure the vengeance of the immortal gods."</p> 
               <p>"Not so fast, my Ulysses; I have not said you should not have Penelope, but only hinted that perhaps you had obtained the best of the bargain. Your plan is undoubtedly a very neat one, but then, you observe, it is so simple that while you and I can see that it ought to succeed with reasonable men, it may not appear thus to these roystering suitors, most of whom have seen the world, and think they are cunning, and will not be put off with fine words. However, there can<pb n=""/> be no harm in proposing the plan to the suitors, if you will take the responsibility of fathering the scheme should it fail."</p> 
               <p>The truth was that Tyndarus was beginning to think the device of Ulysses a very shrewd one, but at the same time it seemed so simple that he was greatly vexed for not having originated it himself, which was, after all, very natural.</p> 
               <p>"It is of no consequence to me," answered Ulysses, "whether you adopt my plan of ridding yourself of the suitors or not. But if the scheme seems so easy to you, why, pray, did you not think of it yourself? Are you more lacking in sense than others? or has your beard turned gray before you have been able to learn that it is not always the simplest things which are discovered first, nor are they always the wisest who rack their brains in search of what seem the most abstruse problems?"</p> 
               <p>"Have it as you will, my friend; why should we quarrel? I doubt not the plan is the best that could be devised just now, and I am sure, no one can be more happy than I shall be if it succeeds. Let us offer a libation to Jove, and after that propose the question to the suitors." Then turning to a slave, Tyndarus said, "Boy, fetch an amphora of Pramnian wine, and the golden goblet of my grandsire Argulius."</p> 
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5784-00000032"/> 
               <p>The wine was brought, and the two kings filled the goblet and poured wine on the earthen floor by way of a propitiatory offering to Jove, after which they drained the goblet themselves, and proceeded to the royal audience hall of Sparta, where Tyndarus seated himself on his ivory-carved, gold-embossed throne, and bade a herald summon the suitors to his presence.</p> 
               <p>The hall was speedily thronged with the impatient princes, and when the heralds had proclaimed quiet, Tyndarus thus addressed the assembled chieftains:-</p> 
               <p>"0 heroes of Greece, it is known to all of you wherefore you are now in Lacedmon. Long you have tarried and learned the quality of Spartan hospitality. But now your subjects demand your return to your kingdoms, and the voice of the shrill winds, and these gray hairs of mine, admonish that winter approaches and that my steps decline to the grave, and that the matter which hath brought you here be settled without unreasonable delay. Now, O heroes of Greece, wise as ye are brave, it is known to all that while many aspire to gain, or rather to confer on my fair daughter, the honor of calling her bride, but one can succeed, while all the others must fail. The chance of each being therefore not great, but jealousies nevertheless<pb n=""/> being bitter, seeing that we are but men, were it not wise, then, O Greeks, to leave my daughter entirely at liberty to choose from your number the one she prefers, and for all to swear that whomsoever she shall select you will allow unmolested to marry her, and with her to inherit my kingdom. And, furthermore, that you will defend the husband she chooses in the possession of her, and aid him in the pursuit of any who may wickedly seek to steal her away, as was done by Theseus the Athenian. Methinks 'twere well you consider this proposal before you decide to reject it."</p> 
               <p>But there was no sign of objection made to what Tyndarus had proposed. From every part of the hall arose murmurs of applause. The plan was so impartial, giving all an equal chance, and the necessity of a speedy settlement of the matter was so apparent, that every suitor fell in with the scheme, and on the following day King Tyndarus led a long and solemn procession to the temple of Jupiter, where each of the suitors in turn took an awful oath to keep the articles of the agreement with all his might in sincerity and truth. On the succeeding day it was announced by heralds in presence of a vast concourse, that the magnificent Helen had made a free, unbiased choice of Menelaus, the son of Tydeus. Naturally<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5784-00000033"/> ally, there were some among the suitors who grumbled; but on the whole the choice was well received, and the question once decided, all left for their own countries and Sparta again became quiet.</p> 
               <p>Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon, who had married Clytemnstra, sister of Helen. The brothers had been deprived of their patrimony and driven into exile by their uncle Thyestes; but Agamemnon, by the aid of Tyndarus, had reconquered Mycen, his father's kingdom, and obtained the hand of Clytemnstra, Helen's sister. Menelaus was still an adventurer, when selected by Helen, without other portion than a good heart, a handsome person, a high and courageous temper, and kinship to Agamemnon, now the most powerful king of Greece. That he was destitute of a dominion of his own, probably made him more desirable as a son-in-law in the opinion of Tyndarus, as after the death of the latter Menelaus and Helen would succeed to the Spartan sceptre, and Lacedmon would thus remain unabsorbed by any other power. Tyndarus did actually die soon after the marriage of his daughter, who for some time lived and reigned happily with the husband so singularly but not unworthily obtained.</p> 
               <p>Ulysses, it is hardly necessary to add, was<pb n=""/> careful not to leave Sparta without Penelope, who loved him very heartily, and as queen of Ithaca and consort of Ulysses, became an exemplary wife and mother.</p>

               <head type="sub">VOYAGE OF THE TRITON.</head> 
               <p>WHILE Lacedmon was witnessing the suit and espousals of Helen, the fame of her beauty, and of the many suitors seeking her in marriage, reached Troy. Few were the ships that came to the coasts of Troas; news between the two countries was rare and stale before the slow-sailing craft could carry it from one shore to the other, and the arrival of a vessel from a foreign land was a notable event, that created a lively interest. It was natural, therefore, that on a certain wild, windy morning, when Paris and his companions were urging their horses over the plains of Troy, in chase of wild boars among the high, rank marsh rushes and reeds near the shore, they should be startled at the sight of a sail bearing towards the land. At once the hunters turned bridle, and galloped down to the beach. Far up on the hard sand the hollow surf tumbled with a deafening roar; the offing was black with tempests, and the lead-colored<pb n=""/> sea was lashed to fury; the air was misty with spray. Rising on the topmost waves, and plunging again out of sight in the trough of the seas, the galley was seen rapidly approaching; her reefed sail had been torn from the sheets, and. streamed aloft like the white wings of the gulls that were blown over the froth of waters. She drove unmanageable before the gale, and, in spite of the utmost efforts of the rowers, was soon among the breakers that ran out a little from the beach. And there, on a ledge hoary with foam, she struck, and soon went to pieces. Before long spars and broken timbers, planks, and oars began to come in on the tops of the surf, and here and there a corpse. The Trojans saw, from their dress and features, that they were Greeks who had come in the ill-fated vessel.</p> 
               <p>About a furlong from the shore a rock jutted from the sea, and on this one of the mariners had secured a foothold, and might now be distinctly seen standing, waving his hands; and, when the gale lulled a little, his voice was borne down the wind crying for help. The Trojan youth did not seem very anxious to save him, and in fact, without any boat, in such a sea, it was apparently an impossibility. But Paris, impelled partly by the promptings of a heart given to sudden impulses, and partly by the generous impetuosity of youth,<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5784-00000035"/> mounted his horse, and urged him into the water.</p> 
               <p>At first the animal reared and plunged and drew back, as the cold surf swirled around his legs, but the courage of his rider, who coaxed and patted his neck, soon reassured him, and he entered the breakers. So slowly did the water deepen, that for more than half the distance the horse could touch bottom; and then he plunged boldly into deep water, and heroically breasted the waves, snorting the spray from his nostrils, and riding on the tops of the billows, until the rock was reached where the man stood. As they came up to it, Paris shouted, "Throw yourself into the water, and grasp my leg." The man did so, and then the horse's head was turned to the shore; but now the waves, that before had been against him, bore him in with his cargo, and in a few minutes the superb animal stood again on firm land, his broad chest heaving with his efforts, and his glistening limbs dripping with the salt sea spray.</p> 
               <p>Soon as they were on land, the man who had been rescued kissed Paris on both cheeks, then kissed the brave horse, and then fell on his knees, and holding his clasped hands to heaven, called on the gods to bless and reward the hero who had saved him. But he must have been a<pb n=""/> very wicked man, for the gods deigned not to listen to his prayers, which were wasted in thin air. Well would it have been for Paris, and for Troy his native city, if he had never rescued the Greek sailor from destruction; for, from what afterwards followed, it almost seemed as if the mariner's prayers had called down curses instead of blessings on Paris and all that he held dear.</p> 
               <p>"Friend, from whence art thou, and what is thy name?" inquired Paris of the stranger.</p> 
               <p>"My name is Cleon, and I come from the coast of Argos, and was pilot of yon ill-fated galley."</p> 
               <p>"Argos?" again inquired Paris; "is not Agamemnon king over Argos and Mycen?"</p> 
               <p>"Aye, that he is."</p> 
               <p>"And hath he not a brother, Menelaus?"</p> 
               <p>"Aye?"</p> 
               <p>"I have heard tell of these royal brothers," continued Paris; "how they were despoiled of their possessions by their uncle Thyestes, and how Agamemnon regained his father's throne. But where dwells Menelaus? Hath he, too, a kingdom now?"</p> 
               <p>Cleon, who had left Greece months before this, while the suitors of Helen were still at Sparta, and before Ulysses had proposed his plan to Tyndarus, replied: "Menelaus that you speak<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5784-00000036"/> of was at Sparta when our vessel sailed from Argolis, together with scores of chiefs from all Greece, who were seeking in marriage the hand of Helen, the daughter and heiress of King Tyndarus."</p> 
               <p>"Helen?" exclaimed Paris, who now, for the first time, heard the name of her who was destined to exercise such an ominous influence over his own and his country's fortunes,-"Helen! 'tis a fair name; and, truly, she must be fair indeed whose love is sought by so many."</p> 
               <p>"Have you not yet heard of the most beautiful woman in all the lands that skirt the blue seas? Why not try to win her yourself, noble Trojan, for surely one so brave and comely might hope to carry off the prize from the noblest of the Greeks," replied the sailor. To this Paris made no answer, although strange were the emotions it aroused in his bosom. Cleon now asked for wine, which was given him from a wooden flask slung over the shoulder of one of the hunters, and the party then bent their way towards Troy, careful to take with them the shipwrecked stranger, to lead him into the presence of King Priam, who would naturally regard him as an object of suspicion and curiosity, and would desire to question him concerning the lands whence he came.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>On the following night Paris dreamed that he beheld Aphrodite, who told him that Helen, the most beautiful woman of her time, was the woman she had destined for him as a reward for the apple he had given her; and she advised him to go to Sparta, and offer himself as a suitor to Helen. When Cleon spoke of the beauty of the Spartan queen, the heart of Paris had been stirred by conflicting emotions, and he already began to resolve within himself that he would sail for Greece. So that, when Aphrodite appeared and encouraged him to go, he hesitated not in forming a fixed determination to sail as early as possible. But, although a king's son, rich in many royal privileges, it was not so easy a matter for Paris to set out on such an expedition as might at first be thought. His father and mother were old, and it was not likely that they would consent to the departure of their long-lost and lately found son, to undertake what seemed to their aged minds a tedious and perilous voyage, and all for a girl with a fair face, when beautiful princesses were to be had for the asking in the cities of the Hellespont; and when, besides, it was only too probable that, by the time Paris could build a vessel and reach Sparta, he would find Helen married. These and other reasons that would very likely be opposed to his arguments in favor<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5784-00000037"/> of the expedition, at once suggested themselves to the ready mind of Paris, who therefore carefully avoided mentioning his intentions to any one until he could contrive the best mode for circumventing these reasons, and gaining his father's consent to the voyage. On reflection, it seemed good to him to say nothing about the real object of the expedition, but to substitute another ostensible aim, which would at least obtain a respectful hearing even if eventually unsuccessful in gaining for him the royal assent to his plan.</p> 
               <p>When Priam was yet a young man, Hercules the hero made a piratical descent on the coast of Troas and bore away Priam's lovely sister Hesione, who, all unsuspicious of danger, was rambling on the shore. Hercules gave her to his friend Telamon, king of Salamis, who graciously espoused the captive maid. At long intervals of time since that melancholy event, Priam had received tidings from his long lost sister; but many years had now gone by without bringing any word from her; was she still living, or had she left the genial light and hidden the gleam of her starlike eyes in the glimmering shades below? Priam had been often heard to speak of her with affection, and to express the earnest wish that he could hear from her once more before<pb n=""/> fore she died, if indeed she were alive. Paris now bethought himself of this, and told Priam that he was anxious to make a voyage to Greece, and see a little more of the world; that, however, he would hardly think it advisable to go merely for such a reason, which, to the unenterprising might appear the ill-digested foolishness of an idle boy; but that, by combining another object with it, the scheme could be made practicable. He was well aware that his father yearned to receive tidings from Hesione, and he would therefore be but too glad to sail for Salamis and obtain information concerning his aunt, and would without delay return after the end in view had been attained. At first Priam and Hecuba refused their consent to the proposed expedition. They were loth to have their late-found son absent for so long a period in lands and over seas which, to their aged perceptions, seemed so full of unknown perils. Another cause for hesitation was the circumstance that the Trojans owned but few vessels, and those were small fishing craft, ill-adapted for voyaging to foreign shores, and consequently a larger and more expensive vessel would have to be expressly constructed. Hector, the foremost son of Priam, and heir to the throne, although, since his reconciliation with Paris, very friendly towards his<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5784-00000038"/> brother, also opposed the undertaking. The rapidly growing wisdom of maturer years had sobered the hot temper he had shown at the games, the impetuosity of his nature the rather serving him in good stead by being brought under curb and rein, and he now surveyed life with more earnest and discerning judgment, as one who realized the responsibilities devolving on the man destined to succeed to the throne of Troas. To him the scheme of Paris appeared what it actually was, a mere pleasure excursion, although he knew not that the real aim of the proposed voyage was Sparta. Therefore Hector told Priam very frankly what he thought of the expedition, advising him to keep his son at home, instead of allowing him to waste the royal treasure in building and fitting out a ship for a sea-rover. As for the plea of going in search of tidings concerning Hesione, he properly considered it a mere pretense.</p> 
               <p>"Even so, my Hector," querulously replied King Priam, whose mind, ingenuous and unsuspicious, but not profound, was unable to perceive that Hector's views might spring from loftier motives than jealousy, and whose disposition, by an infirmity of nature not in the least uncommon, was rather confirmed in holding to the wrong opinion by opposition, however reason<pb n=""/> able; "even so; I doubt not you mean well, and honestly believe what you say. But be not hard on thy brother: what if he be a little restless; he will be sufficiently inclined to moderation when he is a little older, as you are now, for example. And who knows, perchance he may bring good tidings from Hesione to his old father, before I go hence to rest in the tombs of my fathers. And remember that the boy lost many years tending herds on the mountain while you were enjoying royal privileges, and he must now be a little indulged. Say no more about it, fair son, for I have made up my mind, and Paris shall go in search of Hesione to Salamis."</p> 
               <p>In his reply Priam unwittingly gave a key to the reasons that swayed his whole conduct towards Paris. The flight of years had nearly obliterated from his mind the impression made by the dream of Hecuba and its interpretation, while on the other hand he was haunted by a lingering consciousness that he had been guilty of a gross, nay, a tremendous injustice to his long lost son, to whom enough affection and indulgence could not be awarded in compensation for the perils and obscurity of his infancy and youth. This should be considered in palliation of the apparent weakness which so often sullied the royal and parental dignity of Priam whenever Paris was in question.</p> 
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5784-00000039"/> 
               <p>Hector, seeing the uselessness of further discussing the matter, shrugged his shoulders and strode away, muttering to himself that the prophecy of acus the seer might yet come true, and that Paris might yet prove the firebrand that should bring ruin upon Troy.</p> 
               <p>Thus Paris had succeeded in the most difficult part of his plan. The next thing was to build a ship of strength and speed sufficient to carry the pet hero of Troy safely through the turbulent seas. Such a vessel was now constructed in a cove near the Sigean Point. Men experienced in ship-building came from Abydos to frame this vessel. First they climbed. the slopes of Mount Ida, and selected oak-trees, from whose gnarled and crooked boughs timbers fit for the vessel's ribs and keel were hewn and shaped with adzes; a noble stone pine that grew on a crag, overhanging a precipice, and breathing a low, sea-like music through its wide-spread foliage when the south wind blew, was marked out for the mast; the keen axe of the woodmen clove to its heart, and the monarch of the mountain fell with a crash that was heard far around through the glens below. Its branches were lopped, the bark was torn off, and a smooth, tapering, gum-scented spar was the result. Planks, too, were sawn, a the wood thus prepared was carried on the<pb n=""/> backs of bell-tinkling mules, cautiously wending their way down the craggy mountain to the sea-shore. Close to the beach the keel was laid, and one after another the stout ribs were clinched to it, and merrily from day to day rang the clang of the mallets and the shouts of the builders. When the frame of the vessel was completed, it was planked over and ceiled, and the seams were payed with pitch, and painted black, with a streak of vermilion below the gunwale. There was a half deck at the stern on which the steersmen were to sit, and under which was a small cabin; a similar deck was at the bow, to protect the vessel from foundering when she plunged her nose into the heavy seas, and to serve as well for holding the provisions and sheltering the mariners; but amid-ships the vessel was undecked, and across from one side to the other lay the thwarts or seats of the rowers, who were to propel her when the wind died away, or came out dead ahead. The mast was then raised and fixed through a hole in the forecastle; the hempen halyards were rove through the blocks, the yard was slung on the mast, and the sail (she carried but one) was then bent to the yard. On the stern, last of all, was fixed a carved figure representing the sea-god Triton, after whom the galley was named. Then the stores were conveyed on<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5784-00000040"/> board, and the vessel was now ready to put to sea.</p> 
               <p>The day suitable for the launch was decided by a sacrifice to Neptune. When the lamb slaughtered was examined, the omens seemed favorable for launching on the day appointed, and all the Trojan populace flocked to the shore to witness a spectacle so rare and interesting, and, although unknown to the beholders, so fraught with calamities for Troy. Priam was seated on a rocky eminence which overlooked the ship-yard, while a buzz of admiration and wonder arose from the multitudes, many of whom now saw a ship for the first time. And truth to tell, the Triton looked her very best on that day, the mast, stern-post, and figure-head trimmed with garlands, and wreaths of wild flowers adorning the brows of the sailors who were to navigate her over the stormy brine. When the word was given the <name>Triton</name> slid on rollers into the blue water of the gean, which softly glided up the long reaches of sand in silver ripples glistening in the sun, that now hung low in the cloudless west and sheened the glassy deep with twinkling gold. On the following morning Paris and his crew took a solemn farewell of their friends, libations of wine were poured to the gods, the sail was hoisted, and the galley, taking the soft land<pb n=""/> breeze at sunrise, gradually left the towers of Troy behind, and the snow-capped summit of Mount Ida, looking like a summer cloud, resting low down in the horizon. Cleon, the Greek whom Paris had rescued from the shipwreck, had been offered the place of pilot on the <name>Triton</name>, and was only too glad of the opportunity to return to his native land. In rough weather his place was with the steersmen at the helms, which were long paddles turning near the head of the stern-post, and held by grommets made of bull's hide and kept well greased.</p> 
               <p>All day the vessel sailed with the wind right aft. The rapid-rolling waves closely following helped her onward, and at this rate it would not have taken many days to arrive at Salamis. But nothing was further from the minds of the jovial mariners of the <name>Triton</name> than so soon to reach their destination. It was therefore very natural that, when Cleon the pilot looked at the sky at sundown and saw that the ragged clouds foreboded squalls, he should shake his head, and advise Paris to put into a harbor of Lesbos, whose northwest shore was close on the port bow. Paris and his comrades were by this time entirely willing to follow this advice, although previously intending to come to land almost every night, for many of them, including Paris himself,<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5784-00000041"/> had experienced unwonted qualms as the sea rose during the latter part of the day, and more than once heartily wished themselves back in Troy.</p> 
               <p>Hesperus gleamed silverly through a rift of broken clouds, when the <name>Triton</name> glided into a sheltered cove, perfectly tranquil, and dark with overhanging cliffs, on which, here and there, could be discerned the glimmer of a torch, reflected in the placid waters below. Near the top of a distant height a fire in the woods showed where the islanders were making coal, or watching their flocks. In a spot where the sand sloped gradually down, the <name>Triton</name> was gently beached and the anchor, a large square block of stone attached to a cable made of twisted vines, was dropped overboard on the strand to prevent her from sliding off by the action of the water. Immediately the sail was lowered and furled, and Paris and his crew drew out their provisions of hard-bread, wine, olives, dried figs, and salt fish, and after a hearty meal wrapped themselves up in their felt or sheepskin mantles and slept.</p> 
               <p>The following morning was fine and Cleon advised putting to sea; but a group of peasants and fishermen flocked around the galley, closely questioning the Trojans as to whence they had come, and urging them to abide there a few days. Nothing loth, Paris consented, and perhaps it was<pb n=""/> as well that he did so, for that day it came on to blow a gale which surrounded the island with a ridge of roaring foam, although with a clear sky. But little did the galliard crew of the <name>Triton</name> care for the wind, for merrily the days at Lesbos went by. The islanders being famous musicians and poets, and notable growers of the vine, the Trojan guests were very hospitably entertained with great festivity. In the beech woods and the pine groves, sweet with the aromatic fragrance of cones, the mariners danced with the Lesbian maidens, while the rustic poets sang pastoral songs in harmony with the occasion, and the musicians beat the timbrel and the lyre; or by moonlight they trod blithesome dances on the smooth threshing-floors near the hamlets on the mountain sides, linked hand in hand, while the nightingale in the neighboring cypresses wove her exquisite warblings with the laughter and song of the jocund revelers.</p> 
               <p>But this could not last always; the time came when this jollity must cease, and with mutual regrets Paris and his crew bade farewell to the friendly islanders and launched away. It would be too long and monotonous a narrative to tell how the <name>Triton</name> sailed slowly across the gean, stopping at different islands, sometimes only for a night, at other times for weeks. It is sufficient<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5784-00000042"/> to record that without any serious mishaps the galley at length came in sight of Salamis, and moored in a harbor of the beautiful isle. The first question Paris asked of a young man on landing was, "Doth Queen Hesione, the sister of King Priam, yet live?"</p> 
               <p>"Stranger, she yet liveth," was the reply of the youth.</p> 
               <p>"I am Paris, the son of Priam, king of Troy, and am her nephew."</p> 
               <p>"Then thou art my cousin, O stranger. I am the youngest son of Hesione," and the youth fell on the neck of Paris and heartily kissed him on both cheeks, saying, "Thou art welcome!"</p> 
               <p>Paris was then conducted to the palace of Telamon, king of Salamis; his arrival had been announced by runners, and the king met him at the gate and said, "Welcome to Salamis, fair nephew." Then he led him into the palace, where Queen Hesione appeared, gray-haired, but stately, and retaining suggestive traces of former loveliness. She fervently clasped Paris in her arms, and asked him with streaming eyes whether Priam, her brother, yet lived. It was an affecting sight, which failed not to move the warriors, maidens, and servants, who were collected around.</p> 
               <p>Naturally, Paris could not think of sailing away from Salamis for some time. Many were<pb n=""/> the questions to be asked and answered, many the oft-repeated messages which he was to bear home to Troy. Oxen and sheep were slain and roasted whole, panniers of spicy white and purple grapes were brought by the sun-imbrowned hinds from the hill-side vineyards, succulent figs were plucked from the broad-leaved trees, ruby and opal-colored wine from the main-land, and nectareous honey, to which the bees had imparted the flavor of the thyme of Hymettus, abounded, and day and night it was one unbroken round of mirth and joy. Crowned with ivy, laurel, vine-leaves, and roses, the youths and damsels awoke the echoes of the olive-shaded hills with their choral songs. Over all arched the azure sky, without a cloud to dim its lustre, and from all parts of the isle the sapphire sea stretched away undarkened except by an occasional zephyr, and rippling on the yellow sands of the island coves with an undertone of loving music.</p> 
               <p>But Paris was not unmindful of what in his plans was the real aim of his expedition; and while other objects and scenes might sometimes absorb his thoughts, yet his mind often turned towards Sparta, and made him impatient to arrive there. Thus, after a long season of feasting at Salamis, he collected his crew again, bade farewell to his Aunt Hesione, after offering libations<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5784-00000043"/> for her welfare, and hoisted sail for the south of Greece. After touching at various points, and as usual lingering at each place, they finally reached the coast of Argolis, where Cleon the pilot found his wife and friends. There, too, was confirmed the rumor that months before this Helen had made choice of Menelaus and been married to him, and that the crowd of suitors for her hand had dispersed to their homes. This dashed the hopes of Paris. A thousand times in the day he regretted having loitered on the way. When he first heard this unwelcome news he was inclined to return to Troy at once; but each day that he tarried on the coast made him more desirous of keeping on to Sparta; and thus it happened that the head of the <name>Triton</name> was again turned southward, Cleon consenting to pilot them around Cape Malea to the stern, rock-bound bays of Laconia.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter">

               <head>V.</head> 
               <head type="sub">FLIGHT OF THE QUEEN.</head> 
               <p>WHILE the <name>Triton</name> was working her way around the treacherous cape, messengers arrived at Sparta who brought tidings that a vessel had touched at Argolis, having on board a prince from far-off Troy, a man of godlike mien. They added that he had originally started for Greece with the intention of offering himself as one of the suitors for Helen's hand, and although now unable to accomplish that purpose, he, however, still kept on his way to Sparta in order to behold the peerless woman, to be the guest of the worthy man she had chosen, and to learn of foreign lands; and that he would, ere many days, arrive at the port of Gytheum.</p> 
               <p>Great was the interest caused by this news. That one should come across the purple seas to win a bride was a wonderful thing; Menelaus was still more elated by his success in winning a woman whose charms were celebrated in the halls of far distant kings; and Helen secretly<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5784-00000044"/> confessed new joy on hearing how her fame was spread so far abroad, and felt a keen desire to see the man who could brave such perils for her, and who was said, moreover, to possess such personal attractions; perhaps she also regretted for a moment that her decision had not been postponed until his arrival. Much stir was made for the reception of the foreign prince; chambers were prepared for his occupation adjoining the apartments of the king and queen, and mules and servants were sent to the sea-shore to be in readiness to conduct the Trojans to Sparta.</p> 
               <p>In due time, from the steepy cliffs of Laconia, the white sail of the <name>Triton</name> was seen slowly creeping up the gulf to Gytheum, where the galley was stranded, and Paris, with his brown mariners, stepped on shore and mounted the mules for Lacedmon. Paris had brought with him rich stuffs, such as he was wont to wear on festal occasions, well befitting his graceful and symmetrical person; and on the day he entered Sparta he was conspicuous, nay magnificent, with black curls clustering in his neck, robed in a tunic dyed with the juice of Tyrian shells, a panther's spotted hide hanging negligently over one shoulder, and a falchion whose hilt was chased with gold suspended at his side. He rode his sleek, chestnut mule with princely dignity, and when,<pb n=""/> unabashed, he cast the keen glance of his flashing eyes over the throngs gathered to welcome him to Laconia's royal town, he seemed Hyperion himself.</p> 
               <p>A right noble welcome was accorded to his guest by King Menelaus, and a banquet soon followed, when the steam of many a choicely roasted sheep and wild boar, or juicy hares, and delicate quails blown on the coast by the strong winds, filled the hall with appetizing odors; and prickly pears, ovate and saffron-hued, and genial wines were not wanting, and the clang of golden goblets chimed with the voices of chieftains holding grave but kindly discourse, until Queen Helen herself entered and dazzled all the guests with the splendor of her presence. Then a minstrel recited a song celebrating the exploits of the prince who had braved the foam-whitened domains of Neptune to come to Sparta.</p> 
               <p>It was but shortly after the arrival of Paris that Menelaus was obliged to sail for Crete, and invited his guest to accompany him. But Paris declined, for the natural reason that he had but just been voyaging, and had still far to navigate before seeing the towers of Troy once more. Menelaus therefore urged him at least to remain at Sparta until his return from Crete, enjoining Helen to entertain his guests with all needed<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5784-00000045"/> courtesy, and then, so unsuspecting was his soul of guile, he put to sea, and left them there alone. Was it wisely done, O Menelaus, thus unguarded to leave together the man and woman who of all others in the world were most fitted to attract, and who might be supposed to be so naturally inclined to mutual love; was it wisely done, knowing the proneness of the heart of man and woman to passion, and ignorant to a degree of the character of the Trojan prince? Yes it was wisely done, for had not Helen, thy wife, often declared her love for thee, and had she not borne to thee a daughter, the surest pledge for the continuance of her fidelity to thee? nor didst thou think it even possible that a guest, eating and sleeping under thy roof and enjoying the protection of thy hearth-stone, could violate the sacred obligations laid upon him by thy hospitality. It was wise to trust, that as man and woman, as queen and prince, as wife and mother, and as son of virtuous parents, conscience and principle would bid them spurn all thought of defiling thy bed; it was right not to suspect nor to judge them before cause had appeared; it was wise and good to consider them as acting according to the lofty motives of thy own soul. But woe to those who could be so base as to abuse the exalted trust reposed in them by thee!</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>It matters little whether Paris, when he left the gulf of Argolis for Sparta, after learning of Helen's marriage, distinctly avowed to himself the intention of obtaining her love and stealing her away from her husband, or at first recoiled at the thought of such action, and only proceeded thither, impelled by an uneasy craving, at least partially to attain the end for which he had undertaken the expedition by seeing Helen. It is sufficient to know, that, on his first interview with Helen, all virtuous resolution forsook him forever. When she entered the hall, stately and superb, adding to her natural dignity and beauty the recent graces imparted by maternity,-for within the year she had borne a daughter,-and when he heard her voice, exquisite as the note of a nightingale, and felt the glances of her black eyes piercing his heart with sudden tremors, then a storm of passion shook his soul, and a love took possession of his being which lasted through all troubles and vicissitudes, and ceased only with death. But he dissembled these emotions until some favorable opportunity should occur to divulge them to the queen. Such an occasion happened when Menelaus left for Crete.</p> 
               <p>Nor was it long after that event before Paris learned that Helen was favorably inclined towards him. When it was first told her that a<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5784-00000046"/> Trojan prince was on his way to Sparta, his purpose being to offer himself as one of her suitors, and that he was handsome and accomplished beyond all the men of Greece, her warm fancy and expectant curiosity to see the stranger were aroused to that degree, that she was already more than half in love with him before he appeared: not rarely is the susceptible female heart thus ensnared. Therefore, it needed but the presence of the Trojan prince, aided by the irresistible fascination of his conversation and manner, to complete her infatuation, and render her captive to his will. Her lustrous eyes, her flushed cheeks, the thrilling touch of her hands, the trembling of her voice, told him of her love, long before the stolen interview occurred in which he gave distinct utterance to his own emotions. Apparently the days were passed in hunting and feasting, but in reality the lovers were absorbed in each other, and snatched many secret hours for the delicious raptures of unlawful pleasure.</p> 
               <p>However, such a course of pleasure could not go on uninterrupted nor unknown for long. It began to be whispered among the domestics of the royal household that this Trojan prince was no better than he should be; and as for the queen-here they winked at each other, as who should say, "Well, it might cost us dear to speak ill of<pb n=""/> those in high places, but we know what we know." Perhaps Paris opined that these doings were gaining publicity; at any rate, he knew that King Menelaus must shortly return, and then the intercourse of the lovers must cease, unless, indeed, Helen could be induced to fly from Sparta. To Paris, who had nothing to lose by such a proceeding, it seemed an easy matter for her to forsake all, and, a self-banished exile, go with hilt to distant lands. It appeared to him that nothing else was of any worth compared with their love for each other. But although glimpses of what must be the result of their guilty intercourse had shot through her mind at times, Helen had never actually realized, until Paris reminded her of the fact, that her husband must ere long return home, and then it would be too late for her to take any decided action. Whatever she intended to do must be done soon,-whether to allow Paris to sail away, while she remained to abide the wrath of her royal spouse, or to fly at once to Troy, where other honors awaited her in the palace of Priam, and new espousals with the man whom she professed to love above all others, for Paris promised her marriage, on his most solemn oath.</p> 
               <p>Such was the alternative presented for her choice; and the unhappy queen, even amidst the<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5784-00000047"/> transports of love, could not entirely hide from her vision into what an abyss she had irrecoverably fallen. At first she was unable to resolve to abandon in such manner her native halls, her kingdom, her little daughter, who was so dear to her. But as the time for the return of Menelaus drew near, terror, remorse, and shame overpowered these natural and healthful sentiments, combined with her love for Paris. The bond of guilty passion which now united them turned the scale, and she at the last yielded her fate to his charge, and with a certain indescribable bitterness of tone bade him name the day of flight, for she was ready. With a resolution which, in any other cause would have been heroic, a resolution inherited from royal ancestors and warriors, Helen now kept from her thoughts the intrusion of such objects and emotions as would tend to shake her fixed determination; nothing now should interfere with her love for Paris or the accomplishment of the sacrifice she was to make for him. And yet, inconsistently enough, at the very time when she most needed the support of all the firmness she could command,-the approaching hour of departure for the coast,-torn with sudden anguish, and silently advised perchance by the secret suggestions of her better genius, who thus thought to alter her purpose,<pb n=""/> Helen sought her foster-mother, Electra, who had nursed her in infancy and watched over her as a mother after the death of Leda. She was now old and decrepit, dwelling much apart, mumbling to herself, and given to the observation of omens and signs, but always tended with honor and affection by her foster-child, the queen.</p> 
               <p>To her Helen now poured out the misgivings she felt in yielding to the seductions of the Trojan prince and abandoning herself to his plans. "Helen, my queen," replied Electra, in tremulous tones, now for the first time informed of their guilty love, "my mistress and yet my dear daughter whom I nourished at these breasts, beware how you accompany this false-hearted stranger; no good will come of it, but only remorse and calamities untold. Did you not hear the gray owl hooting all yester-night from yonder cypress? I knew it boded no good, And did not the hounds awake you with their howling at midnight? and hear you not the thunders rumbling even now among the gorges of Taygetus? Beware how you go from Sparta with this fair-faced but black-hearted Trojan, away from your child, and from your husband; for I hear the rush of armies gathering around Troy, I hear the clash of arms, the dying groans of myriads, the roar of devouring flames; I hear<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5784-00000048"/> the bolt of doom rushing from the skies on guilty Paris and his relations, and upon you his paramour. Blood! blood! blood! I see the fields red with blood, and infants torn from their mothers' arms and dashed against the Trojan walls! Nay, nay, my child, do not this wicked thing, but prevent, as you may, the wars and desolations that shall most surely come if you follow this thrice-accursed Paris to Troy!"</p> 
               <p>"Electra, would that I could! would to heaven that I had never been born! but now it is too late to turn back! too late,-even while I shrink at the thought of flying from here my heart yearns for this Paris; and is it not decreed too, is it not foreordained by the Fates, that this must be, for did not Aphrodite herself promise me to him? What can I do when my fate urges me on! What are we poor, weakling mortals but toys in the hands of the gods! Alas! alas! my mother, if Menelaus had not left me to go on a wild expedition from which he may never return, perhaps I had not listened to Paris. But now, the resolution is taken which cannot be undone, and I have come to ask thee, O my mother Electra, if thou canst not bless me ere I go!"</p> 
               <p>"Bless thee!" shrieked the withered crone, ominously shaking her white locks and raising<pb n=""/> her palsy-tremulous hand toward heaven, "bless thee! blessings for such as thee! not while I have a voice and hand to call down curses from the immortal gods on such as you and him!" Even while she spoke, a blinding sheet of lightning flashed through the hall, accompanied by an appalling crash of thunder that shook every tower of Sparta. Clasping her hands over her eyes, and pallid as death, Helen rushed shuddering from the horrible voice of Electra, that rang in her ears as the note of doom.</p> 
               <p>That night the guilty lovers fled, taking with them some of the most valuable treasures of Menelaus. They reached the ship unmolested and embarked. But after they had set sail, a tempest came down from the mountain crags of Laconia that shrouded the stars, and howled with terrific rage around the scudding ship, wellnigh causing the <name>Triton</name> to founder, and driving her far out of her course to the southward. They bore away for the eastern end of Crete, where they succeeded in making a harbor to recover from the hardships of the gale; but did not tarry long, lest Menelaus, who they feared was still on the island, should learn that Helen was there. From Crete they sailed to Cyprus, from whence they came to Rhodes, but were again swept to the<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5784-00000049"/> eastward by a heavy northwester, and found shelter far to the leeward in Sidon, on the coast of Phnicia. At Sidon, the crew of the <name>Triton</name> became engaged in a drunken brawl with some of the roystering shipmen of that seaport, in which Paris deported himself with much bravery, bringing off his crew safely to their ship, after sacking a number of low resorts on the wharves, and then making good his escape to the open sea.</p> 
               <p>From Sidon the <name>Triton</name> gradually crept westward again along the snow-capped coasts of Cilicia and Lycia, stopping at Rhodes and Icaria. On the western coast of the delicious isle of Chios the galley was drawn upon the strand, and there, in the little village of Volisso, the sea-wearied wanderers tarried many days to wash away the salt from their faces, and refresh themselves with the mellow fruitage of the plains, and find solace in the music of sheep-bells and reed flutes piping at midday in the valleys, blending with the sound of the languid surf that filled the breezeless air with a ceaseless drone.</p> 
               <p>Cleon the pilot had been forced to steer the <name>Triton</name> thus far, but now, loth to return to Troy, he took advantage of his superior craft as master mariner to contrive to shape a course again across the gean to the gulf of Argolis, pretending, in reply to the upbraidings of Paris and the Trojans,<pb n=""/> that head-winds, sunken reefs, and other bugbears had forced him to this. To linger on the coast of Argos so near to Agamemnon, brother of Menelaus, was the last thing the lovers desired. But by great luck, they picked up a pilot who declared himself experienced in all the perils of the sea, as he had sailed as far as Colchis and Trapezus on the stormy Euxine, and was ready for a large sum to navigate the galley to Troas. Under his guidance the <name>Triton</name> took a fresh start for Troy. After some weeks of dilatory coasting, the voyagers stopped at Crana's rugged, rocky isle on the coast of Attica. Exhausted by the anxieties and sufferings they had endured, and warned by the increasing violence of the winds that winter was approaching,-it was now the inclement season of the moist Hyades,-Helen besought Paris to moor his bark in one of the island coves, and abide there until spring returned. And so they wintered there. The <name>Triton</name> was drawn on shore, and during the short winter days the crew caulked and pitched her seams, which the hot summer sun and the shock of boisterous seas had opened. The large square sail was also mended, and the rigging was overhauled. In after years, when sorrows beat fast around their heads, Paris and Helen looked back to the months they spent on Crana's isle as the happiest<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5784-00000050"/> piest they had enjoyed together, for, shut out from the rest of the world, they there resigned themselves unreservedly to each other's love. But at last the days grew longer, the swallows began to come,-now one or two, then a whole flock twittering wildly with joy, and building their nests even in the crannies and rigging of the old <name>Triton;</name> then came flocks of pelicans, wild ducks, and storks, winging far up in the blue sky in long wedge-shaped lines stretching towards the north; then the buds on the myrtle bushes and almond-trees burst into flakes of snow, a profusion of poppies crimsoned the hill-sides, and the frisking kids nibbled the young grass on the slopes. Then the sailors leaned their shoulders again to work, placed rollers under the <name>Triton</name>, and hove her back into the water, and once more the wanderers essayed to reach Troy. As the vessel glided away from the island, Paris stood up in the stern, and apostrophizing the isle, said, "No longer shall men call thee Crana, sweet isle where Helen made Paris happy with her ever-memorable beauty and love! But henceforth let men call thee Helena!" As he said these words, the crew shouted their approbation; and since that day men have called the island Helena, or Helen's isle.</p> 
               <p>"Is it a cloud I see yonder, over the ship's<pb n=""/> bow? is it a cloud presaging a storm, my Paris, or is it snow on a mountain far off?" asked Helen one fair morning when the <name>Triton</name> was running down the coast of Thrace, while she and Paris stood on deck and watched the land looming ahead.</p> 
               <p>"No cloud is that thou seest, sweet Helen; yon white mass that shines in the distant blue is naught else than the yet unmelted snow that robes Mount Ida,-Mount Ida that like a couchant lion guards sacred Troy reposing in royal grandeur at her feet. If but this breeze holds steady, ere nightfall the noble old <name>Triton</name> will round the Sigean Point, and anchor where we can see the myriad lights of Troy flickering in the dark, like fire-flies in a summer's night, and on the morrow, if the gods please, we shall ride to my father Priam's halls."</p> 
               <p>Paris was right. Before sundown they came to the Troad, and landing on the morrow, rode up to Troy, amid throngs that grew more and more dense as the long-absent prince approached the city gates with Queen Helen. At the gate of the palace, on the marble steps, was seen the imposing and venerable form of Priam, who impatiently listened to the distant cries of the multitudes and turned his eyes intently in the direction from whence came the sounds; and when at<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5784-00000051"/> last Paris and Helen entered the court of the palace, he descended two or three steps to meet them.</p> 
               <p>"Welcome back to Troy, child of my old age!" exclaimed the good monarch with fervor, as he embraced his son. "Where hast thou been all these many months? Do I see thee well?" Then turning to Helen, he said, "And thou too art welcome to our Trojan towers, fair queen of Greece! Methinks these eyes of mine are not yet so dim but what I can see thee to be the loveliest of mortals that ever I have beheld since Hecuba became my wedded bride some two score years agone." Then turning again to Paris, Priam continued, "And what tidings hast thou brought me from my sister Hesione? Does she yet live, and remember her brother Priam?"</p> 
               <p>"She yet lives," replied Paris, "and she has sent by me abundant messages and gifts, which in due season I will deliver according to her desire and your wishes!"</p> 
               <p>Then Hecuba in her turn welcomed her long-absent son, but Helen she received with a cold stateliness and reserve, not entirely free from a trace of suspicion, as if she feared that all was not as it should be. That night Paris and Helen occupied the hall which had been reared for Paris before he had sailed for Greece. But on the following<pb n=""/> lowing day, when Paris had related, in the presence of his father and all the royal family, the tale of his wanderings, and how Helen had been induced to leave her husband and kingdom and fly with him to Troy, in obedience to the guidance of Aphrodite, as he took care to say, loud dissatisfaction was expressed, notwithstanding the semblance of divine sanction which seemed to justify the deed. The opposition came to a head when Paris stated, that having at last reached Troy, he should now celebrate his nuptials with Helen, in pursuance of his oath to her. Queen Hecuba was greatly displeased, and all exclaimed that Helen should at once be restored to Sparta, even King Priam considering this highly expedient, much as he loved Paris, and desired the gratification of his wishes. An intemperate altercation ensued between Paris and Hector, and it is difficult to say how the quarrel might have ended, if the alternate entreaties, imprecations, and threats of Paris had not finally wrought on the heart of his too indulgent father. Priam called the family assembly to order, commanded the fraternal feud to cease, on pain of his displeasure, and decreed that on the morrow Paris should be solemnly and publicly wedded to the queen of Sparta.</p> 
               <p>"The day will come, my royal father," said<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5784-00000052"/> Hector, with profound emotion, "when you and we shall all regret this day's decision. The day will come when we shall rue your weak indulgence towards Paris your son; when the black fleets of Greece sail numberless around the Sigean Point, and mailed invaders darken the Trojan plains like grasshoppers before the east wind, and the walls of Troy nod to their fall. Not unavenged can such a crime be done, and the more when all the heroes of Greece are sworn to protect King Menelaus in his rights."</p> 
               <p>But in spite of the warnings of Hector, it was decided that Helen should remain in Troy and become after a fashion the wife of Paris, and on the morrow the marriage took place. For a while affairs in Troy settled down into their accustomed monotony, and the Trojans almost forgot the circumstances of Paris' return, or, if they ever thought or talked of the subject, concluded that Menelaus would not make any effort to recover his wife, nor the chieftains of Greece assemble their warriors to put into execution the covenant entered into with Tyndarus when Helen made choice of a husband.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter">

               <head>VI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">KINGS IN COUNCIL.</head> 
               <p>BUT while the Trojans were lulling their apprehensions to sleep, and, as is very common, imagining that because they saw no danger none was to be feared, Menelaus was devising means for recovering his wife and wreaking a dire revenge. The flight of Paris and Helen had not been premature, for only a few days after they left the coasts of Laconia, Menelaus arrived at Gytheum. As he approached the shore, he was surprised not to observe the <name>Triton</name> lying on the strand, which, on his departure, was conspicuous for her size and her brilliant tints among the few small, rusty fishing craft of the little port. On inquiry he was informed that the Trojans had already sailed for home. Further concerning the matter he deigned not to question, but, impatient to reach the end of his journey, and full of the joyful anticipation of meeting his lovely wife and child, pushed on as rapidly as it was possible for mules to pick their way over the<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5784-00000053"/> craggy, thistle-grown paths of Laconia. Heralds had announced his approach, and when the king at length arrived at his palace, the elders of the city were assembled there to receive him.</p> 
               <p>After the proper salutations had been exchanged with gravity and reverence, the most venerable of the elders addressed Menelaus in measured terms: "O king, it is not for us mortals, who are doomed to few days and evil and thereafter to dull and forgetful decay, to fathom the counsels of the immortals, and to know why prosperity often happeneth to the wicked and calamity falleth to the lot of the virtuous. It is the fate of mankind, and kings are not exempt from the doom of lesser men, for all are alike but men in the sight of the gods. Know, 0 Menelaus, that a great and unforeseen catastrophe hath befallen you, and with you all Sparta and Laconia. The daughter of King Tyndarus, your royal spouse and our queen, has forgotten her descent, her virtuous training, the husband of her choice, her daughter, and us, her faithful subjects, and has fled from Sparta,-has fled with Paris the Trojan."</p> 
               <p>"Fled with Paris the Trojan, and you, elders of Sparta, dare to tell me of it! Where were ye when this thing was done! wretches, cowards, sons of infamous mothers, who, possessed of gray<pb n=""/> beards, could yet see such things done in my Sparta, and then live to tell me of it with brazen brows!" roared Menelaus, shaking with rage.</p> 
               <p>Anticipating this outburst, the elders stood unmoved, leaning on their staves, respectfully listening to the king, until he paused, when another of their number replied, "O King Menelaus, you do right to, be angry, for there is abundant cause for wrath, but, so far as we are concerned, reflection will show your just mind that herein we are not worthy of blame. As the daughter of Tyndarus, and equally with you our ruler, Queen Helen had rights which we, her subjects, could not question, and among these was the right to do evil. And furthermore, when, before this time, has a queen of Laconia played false to her husband and brought shame on her native land, that we, her subjects, should suspect such things of her, and before the overt act condemn her on suspicion. And when, at the last moment, we learned of her intention to fly with this Trojan, what right had we to interfere with the movements of our queen, whose hereditary servants we are?"</p> 
               <p>Menelaus groaned as he heard implied in such plain but respectful terms that he was conspicuous and alone in the Sparta line as the husband of a woman who had outraged the most sacred<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5784-00000054"/> emotions of her husband's heart and made his name a by-word and a laughing-stock to be bandied with obscene jests by all the foul-lipped runagates of Greece. Gradually he mastered his indignation in sufficient degree to assume a bearing more in accordance with his kingly rank, although at times the fire smouldering within his bosom burst forth in sudden vents of passion awful to behold, like the rage of a lion of the Atlas deserts, the monarch of the rocky fastnesses, who, returning from his search for prey, finds that his lioness has left her whelps and fled with a strange lion whose tracks he detects in his lair. Then he foams at the mouth, lashes his tawny sides with his tail, tears himself with his teeth, and makes the caverns resound and the hills shake with his terrific roars, as he goes in search of the interloper who has destroyed his majestic peace.</p> 
               <p>When he grew more calm and self-contained, Menelaus began to devise measures for the rescue of Helen and the punishment of Paris. Powerful as he was, it would still have been impossible for him to undertake alone an expedition against Troy; and the wisdom of the plan by which the chieftains of Greece were bound by oath to aid the husband of Helen in such an event as the present one, was now apparent<pb n=""/> ent. Menelaus therefore sent heralds to all the chieftains of Hellas, informing them of the domestic disaster which had befallen him, reminding them of the oath they had taken, and summoning them to assemble at Sparta again to concert measures for the restoration of Helen, as once before they had met there to arrange the terms of her marriage. One by one the kings of Greece arrived slowly at the court of Menelaus, showing much less alacrity to gather there now than on a previous occasion. When all who were expected had come, they were assembled in council to decide what was the best means of securing the object under consideration. Menelaus and the younger and more ardent and warlike of the chieftains were for immediate hostilities, and urged that an armament should be at once fitted out so powerful that it would either alarm the Trojans into giving up Helen, or, in the event of their refusal, to raze Troy to the ground. But there were many of the cooler and older members of the assembly, chief among them Ulysses, who held that, before undertaking the great outlays and perils of a dread and uncertain war in foreign lands, it would be well to try the effect of a solemn embassy to King Priam. It could hardly be, they argued, that so wise and just and venerable a monarch would willingly expose his kingdom to<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5784-00000055"/> destruction, for the mere sake of humoring the criminal whims of an unprincipled son. As Menelaus owed the promised assistance of all Greece to the wise councils of Ulysses, he now listened to his present advice with more respect than might otherwise have been the case, and therefore more willingly lent his own influence to induce the whole assembly to agree first to an embassy.</p> 
               <p>The ambassadors chosen were Diomedes, king of tolia, inferior to none of the Greeks in prudence and courage, and Ulysses, the wisest and shrewdest of the men of that generation. Menelaus, by his own choice, accompanied them, to share what perils they might incur in his behalf, and with the hope that when Helen should see him she would be so reminded of former scenes as to repent of her folly and return of her own accord to Greece. After a variety of adventures, the ambassadors reached Troas in safety.</p> 
               <p>It was a fine morning in June. The mild air from the sea, laden with perfume from the lindens, now hoary with odorous blooms, swept softly through the lattice where Helen sat. She was occupied embroidering a piece of tapestry fixed on a frame before her. Slave-girls who had been captured in war attended on her, preparing the threads for her use, or binding up her raven<pb n=""/> tresses, and the while repeating the latest scraps of gossip and scandal they had heard at the public fountain or from their lovers. Sometimes, when the conversation flagged, Helen hummed in a low and slightly plaintive tone, in the sweet Doric tongue, snatches of songs which Nurse Electra had taught her in childhood, or which she herself had sung in chorus in harvest time on the moonlit threshing-floors of Sparta, in her semi-pastoral youth. Through the lattice Helen glanced occasionally with a sigh at Paris, who, in the marble court-yard around which stood the royal palace, was seated with a companion under a trellis covered with clematis and star-flowered jessamine, and was playing dice by the side of a fountain that enlivened the drowsy air with its musical plashings. Paris had learned the game of dice in his Grecian wanderings, from Palamedes king of Euba, who had invented it but a short time previously.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly from the outskirts of Troy arose a faint hum of a multitude drawing nearer by degrees, until the street that led to the citadel rang with a confused din of footsteps and voices. Paris stopped in his game to listen; then he and his companion arose and walked to the gate to see what might be the matter. As he reached it from the interior of the court-yard, the crowd from the<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5784-00000056"/> exterior also arrived at the citadel gate, and at their head were Menelaus, Diomedes, and Ulysses, the Greek ambassadors; so that Paris met them when he passed the gate, and, without having the faintest suspicion of what was to come, found himself suddenly face to face with Menelaus, the man whom he had so basely wronged. He staggered back in amazement, exclaiming, as soon as his tongue could articulate, "What! Menelaus?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes!" replied the Spartan, "I am Menelaus whom you injured, base villain, with a smooth face but the heart of a serpent," and Menelaus advanced a step towards the Trojan prince as if, entirely forgetful that he and his companions were strangers in a foreign and perhaps a hostile country, he would slay Paris on the spot. But Ulysses and Diomedes snatched him by the shoulders and bade him remember where they were. This brought him to his senses, and he controlled himself as the crowd conducted the Greeks into the court and towards Priam's audience hall.</p> 
               <p>The sound of many feet tumultuously treading the pavement caused Helen to look through the lattice. As she cast her eyes below the first object she saw was Menelaus, her deserted husband. At the sight of that noble countenance haggard with the marks of deep mental suffering, the<pb n=""/> blood rushed to her heart, and gasping, "Zepherie! loosen this zone: fetch me some water! quick!" she fell swooning into the arms of her handmaid.</p> 
               <p>The ambassadors were received by Priam with friendly courtesy, and after he had duly welcomed them to the hospitalities of Troy, a day was set for hearing what they were prepared to say, and quarters were then assigned them during their stay in Troy at the spacious abode of Antenor, a chieftain nearly related to the royal family. By him the ambassadors were sumptuously entertained, and when they were rested and refreshed from the labors of their voyage by feasting on the partridges, venison, wild boar's meat, and fat mutton from the flocks of Mount Ida, and nappy wine from Tenedos and Lesbos, the princes and chief men of Troy assembled around the throne of Priam to hear the ambassadors' plea, and consult as to the answer to be given them.</p> 
               <p>Diomedes, black-haired, hawk-eyed, dark-skinned but handsome, muscular but graceful, and perfectly self-assured, first arose, composed and dignified, and stated that the restoration of Helen was the object for which he and his colleagues had braved the rough seas and come to Troy. He narrated at length and without heat, the circumstances of Helen's marriage and subsequent<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5784-00000057"/> sequent flight, and that a great expedition had been on the point of assembling against Troy, when it was finally considered that such was the wisdom, patriotism, and justice of Priam and his counselors, that they would sooner restore Helen than incur the perils of a terrible war, if the matter were fairly represented to them by a friendly embassy. Trusting that this good opinion regarding Priam and his counselors would be sustained by their action on this great question, Diomedes sat down amid murmurs of applause which rang around the hall. A large number of the Trojans present, if not a majority, seemed in favor of restoring Helen, if it could be done without loss of honor, that is, without appearing to be influenced by fear of war.</p> 
               <p>Hector then arose, and in reply said: "O Diomedes, you rightly judge us; we are willing and ready to do all that can be done to render justice in the matter. I swear by the immortal gods, that to none in Troy save Paris was known his plan of going to Sparta when he sailed from Troas, nor was it with our knowledge and consent that he brought the fair Helen hither. But now; while we desire to do what is right, we would not seem to do so as if forced by threats, as though we were weaklings driven to our duty by fear and menace; nor would we hastily, or by<pb n=""/> force, expel Helen of Sparta from our gates against her will, for in so doing, methinks we should be lacking in the sacred rites of hospitality, which forbid us to harm those who have partaken with us our bread and salt, whatever be the cause that led them to seek shelter by our hearth-stones. Nor would we let her go without pledges given that no harm should come to her on account of her fault."</p> 
               <p>Hector was here interrupted by Menelaus, who, like many having his warm but upright nature, was somewhat impetuous and irascible, and had been made the more sensitive by his recent domestic misfortune. He exclaimed: "Is it for you, 0 Trojans, to talk of the sacred rites of hospitality, who have, in the person of your king's son, violated them in the most outrageous manner? And what right have you to stipulate what shall be done to this wicked woman? Am not I her lord and master? Beware how ye delay to restore this woman to me, or, by Jove the Thunderer, ye shall have all the hosts of Greece swarming about your ears like hornets, and we shall pull these fair towers of yours to the ground and sow their foundations with salt!" Ulysses, who was seated next to Menelaus, now succeeded in inducing him to stop in his imprudent speech, which, from the savage joy and defiance expressed in the face of<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5784-00000058"/> Paris and others present, had evidently produced an impression unfavorable to the restoration of Helen. Several started up to reply, but Ulysses, who arose slowly, with eyes cast on the floor, as if seriously deliberating upon the words he was about to utter, was allowed to speak first. His face was covered with a closely trimmed brown beard; his figure was slightly below the middle size, and his bearing and appearance, plain and unobtrusive and resembling rather the traits of a peasant than a king, would scarcely have attracted for him the notice of casual observers, who look not below the surface, and value the man according to the brilliance of his manners and person and the pretensions that he puts forth. But discerning ones perceived in the well-knit frame of Ulysses a form capable of mental and physical endurance beyond that of many of larger proportions, and in his quiet blue eyes and firm set lips they discovered a wealth of intellectual resource and a will to accomplish the projects of his mighty brain, superior to the genius of all his contemporaries. Such was Ulysses, conscious of his power but not forward to thrust himself upon the attention of others; ready for action when action was needed, fertile in providing a way out of difficulties; calm, thoughtful, self-reliant but modest; a great man in a world whose<pb n=""/> great men are rare; a man of few words, but those words oracular.</p> 
               <p>The reputation of Ulysses for wisdom led all present in the assembly to listen to him heedfully, hoping, nay confident, that he would suggest some available plan for the solution of the problem under discussion, and the amicable settlement of all trouble between Greece and Troas.</p> 
               <p>Raising his eyes from the floor, and looking deliberately around the hall,-a king addressing kings,-Ulysses said: "My friends, it ill becomes such as I am, younger than many whom I see in this assembly gray with age and sapient with the experience of long years,-it ill becomes me to counsel you on a question of such moment; nor should I venture to do so did I not stand here as an ambassador from all Greece to Troy, with these my royal brethren. But, however grave may be the cause that hath brought us hither, we are not come to hurl threats at your ears, but only to lay before you a question worthy your consideration, for what would threats avail with men whose valor leads them to scorn fear, the incentive of cowards, and whose wisdom inclines them to listen to the voice of reason rather than to the ravings of passion. It is known to all that war is terrible and the result uncertain, for not always do the strongest win nor the wisest succeed, and many be the<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5784-00000059"/> souls that would untimely speed to Hades and leave forever their faithful wives and blithesome children, if red-armed war should arise between Greece and Troy; and King Menelaus might, after all, fail to recover his wife, or Paris the son of Priam might fail to keep Helen for himself. This being the case, and war to be therefore avoided if possible, were it not well to try, as once before, the effect of leaving the decision of this question to the woman herself. Let her be admitted to this assembly, and before Menelaus and Paris let her decide whom she will choose for the remainder of her days: we, the ambassadors on the part of Greece, as our condition, if this proposal is accepted, will solemnly take oath to make no war against you if Helen should choose to remain in Troy; and that Menelaus will do her no harm, but receive her back to enjoy as before all the rights of wife, mother, and queen, if she should prefer to return with us to Sparta. And you, on the other hand, O Trojans, will swear to place no hindrance in her way if she decides to leave Paris for Menelaus, for by her willing departure at her own free choice you will be saved all imputation of violating the sacred rights of hospitality, or of yielding to any supposed threats of open war."</p> 
               <p>The speech of Ulysses made a profound impression<pb n=""/> pression; his proposal for solving the difficulty seemed to all, Trojans as well as Greeks, as one that was at least worthy of trial. Several arose to speak, causing some confusion, when Priam by heralds summoned the council to order. But Paris, who feared that he might be the loser if Helen should have the opportunity offered her of returning unmolested to her kingdom, to the husband of her early choice, to her daughter, and to her former good name, sprang to his feet as soon as quiet was restored, and with as much composure as he could command, said, "A question of such importance, involving the honor and rights of nations as well as of individuals, should not be decided at once. Surely we are not so pressed for time that we needs must settle this matter with such unseemly haste. It were well to postpone further discussion for some days, and in the mean time to ponder well the proposal of Ulysses. I, for one, cannot consent to this plan without first giving to it the mature deliberation which it deserves." King Priam perceived from the words of Paris that he did not relish the scheme, and therefore dismissed the assembly. If Menelaus had been at first disposed to doubt whether this proposition would prove altogether to his advantage, the opposition of Paris convinced him at once that he had everything to hope from putting<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5784-00000060"/> ting it to the test, but at the same time prudence suggested that by no words of his should his rival discover how he regarded the plan.</p> 
               <p>During the days immediately following, Hector and the leading Trojans expended every effort to persuade Paris to grant his assent to the trial of the method so desired by all as the means of evading the otherwise unavoidable trouble arising from his own misdeeds, but he steadily refused to listen either to expostulation or entreaty. When upbraided for his selfish and treasonable conduct, and reminded of the awful results which hung upon his decision and the fearful responsibility which he seemed so lightly and readily to incur, Paris contented himself with saying that the Greeks had not yet made their threatened invasion; that when they appeared on the coast it would be time enough to parley with them; and that even then the goddess who had been instrumental in bringing about the existing difficulties was abundantly able to succor Troy in its need; that as for himself, having tasted of the bounty of Aphrodite, he was now willing to continue his trust in her benevolence and power; that Helen had of her own accord, being a free woman, chosen to accompany him hither and become his wife; that he loved her and therefore should not resign her after braving so many perils for her<pb n=""/> sake; and, that for the rest, he was weary of further wrangling in the matter, and advised his friends, who doubtless wished him well, to look after their own affairs and he would take due heed to his own household.</p> 
               <p>Helen, the one above all others most concerned in the question, was obliged during this momentous crisis to occupy a false position and to remain silent and passive when her heart was rent by conflicting emotions, a prey to fearful anxiety and suspense. If Paris bad shown confidence in her love for him, and permitted her to choose between him and Menelaus, such is the inconsistency of a nature that is habitually swayed more by feeling than by reason, that it is not unlikely such an example of magnanimity on his part would have caused her to decide in his favor, although she might have regretted the decision as soon as taken. But since he had refused her this mark of trust, her indignation carried her to the opposite extreme. She now realized, as never before, that in abandoning the hereditary and marital rights she enjoyed at Sparta and coming to Troy she had also resigned her personal liberty, she, a woman born a queen and as proud as she was beautiful. It was henceforth not a question of love but of independence and free agency, whether she continued in Troy<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5784-00000061"/> or returned to Sparta. It was only natural that the moral qualities of Menelaus and the advantages she had forfeited by her flight, should assume in Helen's present state of mind a value exaggerated even beyond their actual worth, and that she should resolve that this opportunity for regaining her lost position in Greece must not be allowed to escape. But how was she to avail herself of the presence of Menelaus in Troy, or bring about the trial of the scheme of Ulysses, of which she had learned by report, for Paris would tell her nothing of what had transpired in the assembly. Until it was certain that the plan would prove abortive, her pride restrained her from seeking an interview with Menelaus, as she would, to obtain his favor, be obliged to confess repentance for her misdeeds; nor if inclined, did she yet dare to steal such an interview, for, if discovered, the rage of Paris might prove fatal to both Menelaus and herself; nor, for a like cause, would it answer to attempt to escape with the ambassadors to Greece. Her only hope, apparently, was to secure the adoption of the proposed plan, and this she must do without arousing the suspicion of Paris. Helen finally contrived secretly to meet Hector and Antenor, who, as she knew, were favorable to her restoration to Menelaus, and besought them with entreaties to use their<pb n=""/> influence with Priam and Paris, for the safety of their own land if not for her advantage. They deeply sympathized with her, and also with her foresaw too well the war that must inevitably ensue if this mode of settlement were not adopted, and assured her that they would leave nothing undone to aid her cause and to avert such misfortunes; but they also plainly told her that it was but a forlorn hope they entertained of seeing the question amicably adjusted. Paris, although of a soft and voluptuous nature, was possessed of an unyielding will, and of sufficient courage to risk much for his so-called rights and privileges; Priam was entirely under his control, and without the royal consent the embassy must fail of attaining its end. These worthy men also strove to comfort Helen by saying that so long as she remained in Troy she would find them her friends, and that if fate destined her to abide there, she would always have the steady affections of Paris, who, if selfish, was at least brave and handsome, and that she would continue to enjoy position and luxury in Troas inferior only to those of Queen Hecuba. Poor solace was this for a woman in her circumstances.</p> 
               <p>But while Helen plied her brain for contriving means of availing herself of this occasion for returning to Sparta, and before any hopeful<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5784-00000062"/> solution had presented itself to her half-crazed mind, another assembly was suddenly convened by the heralds, for the purpose of proclaiming to the ambassadors the decision of Priam. The king of Troy, contrary probably to his better judgment, but deferring to the will of Paris, now declared that the proposal of Ulysses was not a possible one, since Helen seemed contented in Troy, and therefore it would be useless, yea wrong, to withdraw her from her quiet pursuits to vex herself with the consideration of a matter so perplexing as to tax the sturdy reason of monarchs and sages; and that in such a grave business no decision of hers could be considered ultimate, for women knew not their own minds, as she herself had testified on a previous occasion, when she had made choice of a man, whom, as the event afterwards proved, she did not love as a woman should love the man whom she weds. Further discussion about the restoration of Helen was therefore useless, a mere multiplying of windy words.</p> 
               <p>The ambassadors were prepared for this adverse decision, and received it in silence, with the exception of Menelaus, who said: "I had hoped different things of you, O Trojans; nor do I hold you all alike guilty for the result reached; nor would we, the ambassadors, depart<pb n=""/> from Troy without thanks for the hospitality and courtesy you have extended to us. But we shall return here before long and put your hospitality to a severer test; we shall come with fleets and armies; the torch of war will blaze over these towers, and may the just gods judge between us, and award victory to the right!"</p> 
               <p>"So be it!" responded King Priam, and the assembly dissolved. On the following day the embassy sailed for Greece, without Helen.</p>

               <head type="sub">MARS THE ARBITER.</head> 
               <p>THE die was cast. Throughout the valleys and mountains of Greece echoed the notes of war. The anvils of the craftsmen rang with the beat of hammers forging swords and spears; and the peasants left their flocks and fields to be tended by their wives and children, exchanged the crook for the javelin, and at the summons of their chieftains leaped down the mountain paths to the sea-ports, sandal shod, and carrying in leathern wallets their provisions of hard bread, olives, and cheese. At the coast they found galleys building and fleets collecting, amid the clang of ship-builders' and caulkers' mallets, and the shouting and swearing of sailors browned by the sun of distant seas.</p> 
               <p>Aulis, a port in Btia, was designated as the harbor where the combined fleets were to assemble, and from whence they should sail together against Troy. As might be expected, many months elapsed before the different fleets all arrived<pb n=""/> rived at Aulis with their contingents of warriors. But a noble sight it was to see them all there at last, crowding the little harbor, and the strait between Euba's isle and the main-land. Twelve hundred vessels were there collected, carrying a host of a hundred thousand men. Agamemnon king of Mycen and brother of Menelaus was, after some successful intriguing on his part, chosen general of the expedition, with the title of King of Men. Under his leadership were many celebrated chieftains, of whom the most distinguished was Achilles, the son of Peleus and Thetis the Nereid. He led the Thessalian forces, and was a man of large stature but well proportioned, possessing a great genius for war and surpassing muscular strength; to these were added many noble qualities of mind and heart, which, however, were too often sullied by deeds of cruelty done in moments of ungovernable rage. Diomedes and Ulysses have been already mentioned in this narrative. Nestor, king of Pylos, was now an old man, but the wisdom he had gained from a long experience made him a sage counselor, although it must be confessed that he sometimes took advantage of the deference awarded to his years to weary his comrades with long speeches in praise of his former exploits, and to draw rather sharp comparisons between the<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5784-00000064"/> heroes of the Trojan war and the comrades of his youth. Ajax Telamon was a chief who was generally acknowledged to rank second to Achilles alone in martial fire and strength; but he lacked some of the nobler traits which distinguished Achilles and rendered him the first warrior of his time, unless we except Hector the Trojan, who, if not quite so successful in war, was, on the whole, superior to Achilles in a certain grandeur of soul rarely equaled. Many other chiefs notable for valor were connected with the expedition, which comprised forces collected from Laconia, Arcadia, tolia, Thessaly, Attica, Phocis, Epirus, Crete, Rhodes, Ithaca, and almost every sea-shore town and rock-built hamlet and vine-mantled isle of Hellas, the land of brave men and beautiful women.</p> 
               <p>Before the fleet put to sea, it was agreed that arrangements should be made at all the islands they passed for having signal fires lit on their summits as soon as Troy should fall, to telegraph the tidings across the gean to Greece. When the vast fleet at last got under way, it was a gallant sight to see so many vessels gliding like an innumerable flock of swans over the blue sea. Some of the galleys were painted black, some yellow, and some even vermilion. Some of them were formidable with iron-shod beaks of oak; others<pb n=""/> bore shapely figure-heads on the prow, and the row-locks were also curiously wrought with carved work. The sails were of bulls' hides or hempen canvas; and some gleamed white in the sunlight and others were colored with variegated tints and signs. The broad sail of the galley which carried Agamemnon was embroidered with ingenious devices worked by the cunning needle of Clytemnstra, his queen. As it was difficult for a fleet of this size to come to anchor every night under the lee of the land, there was nothing to be done but to keep a straight course for Troy, trusting to the banks of oars when occasion required. But although it was the plan to steer directly for Troas, which does not appear hard for one who has coasted the gean a few times, it seemed an impossible undertaking for the fleet pilot to accomplish, although he sailed in the galley of Agamemnon in the van of the fleet. He was doubtless some court favorite who had secured this responsible position by means of plausible promises and royal influence, without having the requisite experience and knowledge, as was clearly proved when the fleet made land at dawn some days after leaving Aulis. To the northwest lay the bold shores of a vine-covered island, on whose mountainous sides lingered the smoke-like mists of morning; to the southward stretched<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5784-00000065"/> the mouth of a large bay, and directly ahead arose the main-land, trending north and south as far as the eye could see, and so near that the surf could be heard booming in the caverns at the foot of the brown cliffs. All concluded that they had at last reached the coasts of Troas, and looked to see the sun sheening the battlements of Troy, except a few of the older mariners, who shook their heads, and muttered that Troy lay far to the northward.</p> 
               <p>But Agamemnon, summoning the chief pilot, said: "I have heard that Troy can be seen by vessels approaching the coast of the Troad; I see no Troy yonder, but of course thou canst tell where we are. Knowest thou this coast?"</p> 
               <p>The pilot, very ill at ease, replied, "O King of Men, many seas have I sailed over and much have I seen, but this coast I remember not. Yonder island to the northward must be Tenedos, but verily the gods must have destroyed Troy for its crimes, for surely no Troy is to be discerned on yonder shore."</p> 
               <p>"Wretch!" cried the King of Men in well-deserved wrath, "Didst thou not swear that thou hadst coasted by all the shores of the gean, and yet thou knowest not this coast, which is but a few days' sail from Aulis! Either thou hast soaked thy brains in forgetful wine or thou hast undertaken<pb n=""/> taken to guide the fleets of Greece without knowledge."</p> 
               <p>"O king!" interposed an old mariner who was standing by and ventured, as a Greek sailor, to have and to express his own opinion of matters on shipboard, "yonder is not the isle of Tenedos, but the much larger island of Lesbos; southward lie the bay of Smyrna and Clazomen, and the coast ahead of us is Mysia and not Troas!"</p> 
               <p>"Dost thou hear what he saith!" growled Agamemnon, turning to the head pilot; "what hast thou to say in reply?"</p> 
               <p>The head pilot, answered hesitatingly: "It is possible, O king, that this may be the coast of Mysia; the most experienced, it is well known unto you, are sometimes in error. But, by Jupiter, this is the first time such an accident ever befell me in all my voyaging!"</p> 
               <p>"Swear me no Jupiters!" roared Agamemnon, who now saw that the pilot knew as little as he did about the course marked out. "Swear me no Jupiters, villain! It is not thy fault that the whole fleet with the destinies of Greece did not make shipwreck on yonder white breakers." Then turning to the crew, Agamemnon cried, "Cast him into the sea, a warning to knaves! and let this stout mariner who knows the coast be the pilot of the fleet!"</p> 
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5784-00000066"/> 
               <p>Several rough seamen laid hold of the head pilot, and, leading him forward, prepared to execute the king's command. The trembling wretch heartily begged for his life, and just as he was about to be tossed over the bulwarks, Agamemnon yielded to the entreaties of those about him, and consented that the fellow be let off with his life, but ordered that he be degraded to the banks, and ply at the sweeps like a slave.</p> 
               <p>However, although this was not the coast they had sought, the crews were clamorous for permission to go on shore and refresh themselves with fruit and wine; therefore some of the smaller galleys were beached and their crews landed and scattered inland among the vineyards and fig-trees, and rifled the huts of the peasants. But this marauding did not last long; for Telephus, the king of the country, was the son-in-law and ally of King Priam, and when he heard that Greek sailors and soldiers were devastating his territory he called out his bands and fell on the scattered invaders, who, expecting nothing of the sort, were taken unawares, and were pursued with great slaughter to the shore. There Achilles succeeded in rallying them, and maintained a bold front until most of the stranded galleys had been launched again. In the latter part of the conflict Telephus was severely hurt by the hand<pb n=""/> of Achilles, which enabled the Greeks to beat back the enemy and carry off their wounded. Disheartened by this untoward event, the Greek leaders decided to leave the Mysian coast without delay; but in weathering the southern end of Lesbos, a sudden and furious tempest came howling from the mountains and smote the devoted fleet, scattering it in all directions. Some of the ships were engulfed in the yawning depths with all on board, and the remainder were terribly buffeted and shattered by the vast surges that swept their decks with foam. The surviving vessels after a while made out to reach various ports of Greece; it was several months, however, before they could be refitted and collected once more at Aulis for a fresh start.</p> 
               <p>But a long succession of baffling winds now prevented the expedition from sailing, and much murmuring and dissatisfaction was heard from the idle crews, until Calchas, the chief soothsayer of the fleet, declared that the delay was due to the conduct of Agamemnon. It seems that when following the chase in the region about Aulis, the King of Men had by a rare shot slain a stag belonging to Artemis. So far, perhaps, no harm was done, for he doubtless killed the beast in ignorance, but not satisfied with this, he incautiously boasted that he could surpass Artemis herself in archery.<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5784-00000067"/> Angered and insulted by this foolish vaunt, Artemis sent these head-winds, and her wrath could only be appeased, as Calchas affirmed, by a sacrifice to the offended deity, and the offering must be nothing less than Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon. Deep was the anguish of the king, sorely did he lament his indiscretion; but nothing would avail to avert the ire of the goddess, and at length Agamemnon yielded to the dangerous clamors of the assembled hosts, and sent Ulysses to Mycen to conduct Iphigenia to Aulis. Beguiled by the pretense that her daughter was destined to be given in marriage to Achilles, Clytemnstra not only allowed her to go, but also accompanied her, to assist in the preparation for the nuptial rites.</p> 
               <p>On arriving at Aulis, and the pavilion of her royal father, Iphigenia was told what was the real purpose for which her presence there was desired, and her father entreated her, as she valued her proud descent and the success of Greece in the approaching conflict, to meet her doom with resignation. At first she gave vent to the most agonizing appeals for mercy, piteously laying hold of her father's beard, in token of the sacred and profound duty which as parent and king he owed to preserve her from harm. Then moved by the violence of his mental sufferings, and the fearful<pb n=""/> responsibilities which cruel fate had laid upon him, she mourned for him and heroically dissuaded Achilles from attempting her rescue, for the beauty and fortitude of the maiden inspired the son of Peleus with love, and prompted him to risk his own life in a desperate effort to shield her from death. Then in the most exalted strains of patriotism, Iphigenia expressed her willingness to perish for the cause of Greece, her native land. "O Helen, by what sorrows must that crime of thine be expiated!" was all allusion to the original source of her fate which escaped from the lips of the heroic girl.</p> 
               <p>They led her forth to an altar erected in an arena, around which were collected the hosts of Greece in solemn and silent expectation. At the altar stood Calchas, white-bearded and dark-browed, holding the sacrificial knife in readiness. The eyes of Iphigenia were bound after she had taken a last look at the sun just bursting over the hills of Euba, and then the priest raised his blade to strike the white throat of the unresisting victim. Agamemnon, her father, enduring untold agony and pallid as death, drew the mantle over his countenance, and all the multitude held their breath, sharp-featured and listening intensely for the first blow of the fatal knife. At this supreme moment of exquisite suspense, a flash of<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5784-00000068"/> lightning blinded the eyes of all for an instant, and when they recovered from the shock, Iphigenia had disappeared, and in her place stood a white doe. Artemis, smitten with pity, and appeased by the measure of suffering already endured by the offender, had snatched away the virgin, and substituted one of her deer, which was now slain and offered up to the goddess. Years after the lost maiden was heard from again. She had been carried to Taurica Chersonesus, and made a priestess in the temple of Artemis.</p> 
               <p>As might be expected, on the day after the sacrifice, the wind veered to a favorable quarter, and the expedition sailed for Troy, now destined to waste ten long years in a harassing war, for, while the fleet was lying at Aulis, Calchas observed a serpent glide from under the altar on which he was sacrificing, and wind up a tree until it reached a nest containing a bird and nine birdlings, which the reptile devoured. This omen the priest interpreted to mean that not until the tenth year of its siege would Troy succumb to her foes.</p> 
               <p>When the fleet neared the Troad, Calchas announced the Delphic oracle, which foretold that the first man of the Greek forces who stepped foot on the coast of Troas was doomed to immediate death. Could anything have acted more as a<pb n=""/> damper on the impetuosity of the host than such a prediction? Who of all the chiefs and crews would dare first to leap from the galleys and first tread the Trojan shore, in order that success might crown the arms of his comrades? And yet, until one could be found inspired by such lofty heroism, such unheard of self-abnegation, no landing could take place. Protesilaus was such a hero: he devoted himself to certain death. When the fleet at last came in sight of the Phrygian coast, a vast crowd of sails lessening to mere glittering specks in the dim offing, a band of Trojan horse and foot, who were on the watch for the invaders, rode down to the beach to oppose the landing. Uttering a prayer to Jove, and with the precious name of Laodamia, his noble wife, on his lips, Protesilaus. leaped from his galley as the keel grated on the sand, holding a broad buckler in front with his left hand, and a glittering spear in the right, which he hurled at the Trojans, who now gathered fast around him. He then drew his double-edged sword, and for a few short moments the crest of horse-hair on his helmet could be distinguished darting hither and thither in the desperate affray; but before the Greeks could come to his aid, he fell on the sand pierced with many wounds, and the Greeks were only able to recover a corpse which was honored<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5784-00000069"/> with an imposing funeral. Let the name of Protesilaus be held in lasting remembrance!</p> 
               <p>It is worthy of notice that in this brief conflict between the Greeks and Trojans, Achilles and Hector met for the first time, and measured swords in the war which was destined to give each such imperishable renown and to prove so fateful for both. Hector not only commanded this handful of Trojans which had slain Protesilaus and opposed the landing of the Greeks, but he was also general-in-chief of the Trojan forces. The Trojans had not been entirely idle while the Greeks were preparing for war; they also had made their preparations for the approaching contest; larger crops had been sown, harvested, and garnered for the siege, during the previous year; and the heralds of King Priam had warned all the chiefs and cities subject to him that an invasion was imminent, and that provisions, munitions, and warriors would be expected of them. Large supplies and a powerful garrison had therefore been gathered within the walls of Troy. There were several chiefs of note and experience who hoped for the command of the Trojan forces, as Priam, once an able captain, was now too old to lead his armies to battle. But to the surprise of many and the jealousy of older and more experienced chieftains, Hector was the one chosen<pb n=""/> by Priam. His father had evidently studied his son's character and observed how its nobler traits had shone out more and more of late years; and Priam's choice proved the best that could have been made; while Hector lived Troy was safe.</p> 
               <p>As soon as the Greek army had landed, the galleys of the fleet were hauled well up on the beach, there being no perceptible tide to disturb them, and nothing to fear from the rapid current of the Hellespont, near by. The vessels were thus entirely safe from the sea after they had been shored upon either side. A portion of the crews were quartered on board, while the rest encamped in tents and booths. These preliminaries having been completed by the enemy, and the fleet being therefore effectually prevented from being made easily available, the Trojan chiefs clamored for an immediate attack on the invaders. "Now is the time," they said, "when an attack would be most fatal to them; for their preparations for defense are not yet ready, and could we but burn the fleet not a soul of them would ever return home alive." But Hector, although by disposition somewhat impatient and impetuous, wisely controlled his own inclinations and overruled these counsels. "The forces of Troy are so inferior in numbers," he said, "that we should most likely fail in assailing<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5784-00000070"/> such a vast host, doubly strong as they would be in their desperate efforts to save their ships from destruction, and if we were beaten back, they would follow the fugitives into the city gates and Troy would fall in an hour. No; my plan is to stand on the defensive. They will try to storm the walls of Troy, and failing in that, will then have to provide themselves with provisions, and thus protract the siege to such a degree that, in the mean time, we can gain reinforcements and gradually worry them until scarce a handful will remain for us to capture."</p> 
               <p>Hector's plan was excellent, and had he lived a little longer than he did, Probably Troy would not have fallen. As Hector foresaw, Agamemnon drew out his host from the camp soon after, and hurled them against the massive walls of Troy in a terrific assault led by Achilles himself. The Greeks advanced in dense masses, holding their bucklers, over their heads to protect themselves from the stones, the javelins, the boiling oil, and the beams thrown from the ramparts. Trunks of trees shorn of their branches and propelled by many hands, were swung against the sturdy gates to batter them down, and ladders were planted against the walls, up which the assailants swarmed like bees, only to be driven back with prodigious slaughter. Hector, ably<pb n=""/> assisted by Paris, neas, and other chiefs, led the Trojans, and his noble form was conspicuous throughout the tumult, darting from one tower to another, encouraging and directing his men. Terrible was the din of the conflict, loud were the shouts of the combatants, wild were the groans of the dying, and fierce was the gleam of the low sun flaming, from under the stormy clouds upon the myriads of blood-streaming spears, and helmets of brass that bristled on the battlements and the plain below. But so well was the defense conducted, that Agamemnon was finally forced to recall his army. As they retreated to their camp, a body of Trojans led by Paris issued from the Scan gate, cutting off the stragglers and annoying the rear of the foe. Troy never before saw so bloody a day, and the Greeks never again attempted to carry the city by a direct assault.</p> 
               <p>As Hector had predicted, the efforts of the invading army were after this, for nine long years, directed to supplying themselves with provisions and to the reduction of Troy by cutting off its resources. For this purpose part of the Greek army was detailed to guard the fleet; another detachment was employed in sowing and harvesting grain, while the remainder were sent on various expeditions against cities allied to<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5784-00000071"/> Troy. By the capture of these places the Greeks hoped not only to secure forage for themselves, but also gradually to cut off Priam's supplies of provisions and men, until Troy should stand unaided and alone and fall from sheer exhaustion. But this plan, although a good one, was not entirely successful; for allies in distant lands often forwarded succors to Troy, and at the end of the ninth year of the siege the respective strength of the two parties for offense and defense was still nearly equally balanced. Combats were of course of frequent occurrence, sometimes between two champions, sometimes between large bodies of men, but never with any decisive result.</p> 
               <p>It was during this interval, toward the ninth year of the siege, that Achilles captured the city of Theb south of Troy, at the foot of Mount Placus. It was quiet little town, noted for the noble plane-trees that overhung its gates and public green, under which the children gamboled, while the women washed their clothes in the stream that dashed through the town, and the old men dozed or garrulously gossipped about the, long-past days of their youth. In the neighborhood were fine pasture lands and wheat-fields; but the fierce Achilles knew that Priam had drawn supplies from Theb, and therefore he stormed<pb n=""/> its walls and burnt it to the ground. The ruler of the place and his seven sons were slain, and his wife was carried into captivity; but Andromache, his lovely daughter, by the aid of an old and faithful household servant, escaped to Troy. She sought refuge and support at the feet of Priam, who raised her up with tears coursing down his cheeks, and vowed that while Troy stood she should be safe, with all her wants well supplied. Hector entered while Andromache was suppliant on her knees, before Priam. Her long golden hair rippling disheveled over her face and shoulders, her large blue eyes shining softly through tears, her sweet low voice pleading in earnestness, and her tall and beauteous form, made an immediate and lasting impression on the heart of the stern yet ardent and true-souled hero. He asked her to become his bride. Little had she expected to find so soon such a protector; but she agreed without hesitation to his proposal, as what woman would not in the circumstances; and thus in the midst of war it came about that the sound of festal pipes and dancing was heard in Troy, and that the narrow streets of the beleaguered capital were thronged with women and children collected to see the bridal procession; and such was the interest taken, by the Trojans in this princely pair, and such their<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5784-00000072"/> love for Hector, that when a son was born to Hector and Andromache, and his father would have called him Scamandrius, the Trojans said, "Nay, but he must be called Astyanax, the defender of the city, for he is the son of great Hector, and like him will become the defender of Troy;" and so the boy was named Astyanax.</p> 
               <p>During these long years of desultory warfare, Paris and Helen, the persons most implicated and most interested in the events that were occurring on the plains of Troy, maintained toward each other the same outward relations as before the war began. Paris continued to love the Spartan queen with unabated ardor; the flame of his passion, which might perhaps have otherwise somewhat cooled, being probably stimulated by the bold front he was always obliged to oppose to open or implied suggestions that he had best restore Helen to her husband; despite against Menelaus for having raised such a pother about his head also strengthened an emotion which, if he had been left to enjoy it unmolested, would very likely have shaded off before many years into indifference; for criminal love, once its edge has been taken off by gratification, is liable to lose its power over the heart. Paris had by a natural process of sophistry, gradually wrought himself into the fallacious but pleasing belief that<pb n=""/> he was a wronged man in being made the butt of Greece. Had not Helen been promised him by divine authority, did she not love him more than Menelaus, and had he not publicly married her in Troy, when he might as well have retained her there merely as his concubine? For the rest, Paris always regarded and treated her with tenderness and respect, and his conduct elsewhere was on the whole not unworthy of her esteem, for he often entered with spirit into the sallies made by the garrison or the forays after provisions and reinforcements; although it must be confessed that his prevailing mood was for the transports of pleasure or the soothing languor of voluptuous repose. Like men of that disposition, he was capable of great exertions, but at intervals and by sudden and violent effort; he was a Greek with some of the hot blood of Asia darting fitfully through his veins, from whence resulted many apparent inconsistencies in his complex character.</p> 
               <p>But with Helen it was different; while still in all appearance true to her Trojan lover, a close observer might have detected signs which showed that her affection for him had begun to waver. In reality, while not entirely estranged from him in soul, and while still subject to casual returns of the passion which had once been powerful<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5784-00000073"/> enough to make her stake on it her reputation, husband, daughter, and throne, her sentiments toward Paris had greatly altered, especially after the evidence she had that he feared to confide in her decision at the time the ambassadors were in Troy. That was an insult to her love which, however unjustly, she always proudly resented and never forgave. As her affections cooled, she was better able to perceive how fatal had been the passion to which she had yielded, a reflection which by no means tended to increase her love for Paris. Experience,that grim and forbidding monitor, who, Cassandra-like, is disbelieved when she prophesies through the lips of others, and whose unerring counsels it is too late to follow when they are at last credited, now came again to Helen and made her tremble. She saw that passion entices into the snare with gilded lures to betray. Deep and unavailing longing for her home, her daughter, her husband; remorse for all the calamities brought on the nations by her crime, and sometimes an aversion approaching to hate toward Paris who had brought her, alas too willingly! to this pass; these emotions not rarely filled her soul with bitterness. But Helen had the sense and moral strength to dissemble such thoughts while she remained in Troy, knowing that increased misery would be the only result if<pb n=""/> her true sentiments should become known. It could not be but that her nature became altered and hardened by the circumstances into which she had fallen and the conflict of fierce passions to which she had become a prey. Circumstances control the character of pliable and feeble mortals, and may transform the fairest and purest into demons of iniquity. But during the years since her flight from Greece and the troubles through which she had passed, the beauty of the Spartan queen lost none of its splendor. She continued as fair, as fascinating, as magnificent, as when she first arrived in Troy, commanding the admiration of old and young, and even of the women who, when she went to the walls to see the armies fighting, demanded back from her with reproaches the husbands and sons whom she had slain by her sin. For the most part Helen tarried in the halls of Paris on the Pergamus, weaving the story of her adventures into many colored tapestry.</p> 
               <p>Thus the long years of the siege went slowly and monotonously away, and the people of Greece, the lonely wives and children, watched impatiently for the beacon-fires that were to flash the news of Troy's fall across the gean.</p>

               <head>VIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">NONE.</head> 
               <p>WHILE the events of the past decade were transpiring, none, the wood nymph, still dwelt on Mount Ida lamenting her lost love. When Paris left her for Troy, she had a presentiment that he would remain there, notwithstanding his promise to return to her with all possible expedition. But when the days passed in which he might have been expected, then, naturally enough, although inconsistently, she was overwhelmed by keen disappointment and despair. From day to day she watched the slow sun climbing the heavens, saying to herself, "Perchance he may come to-day." But day after day went slowly by and Paris came not, and her sorrow, unassuaged by time, grew more violent and heart-rending. She tried to believe that some accident might have befallen him, but even this poor consolation failed her on further reflection; she knew that there was not a leopard or a bear but fled or succumbed before his arrows, and her<pb n=""/> inexperience of the world suggested few other dangers to which he could be fatally exposed. Her mind constantly reverted to the promise of Aphrodite, until her fears settled into conviction that not to wild beasts, but to the beauty of another woman, had Paris fallen at last a too willing prey. This conviction it was that pierced the soul of poor none and crazed her brain. Deserted for another, the sense of injury undeservedly inflicted upon her by one who had gained her affection only to betray her into untold misery, the loss of him whom she loved so tenderly and faithfully, these thoughts wrought upon her until her mind wandered and the wild glance of frenzy gleamed in her blue eyes. Moaning to herself, or trolling melancholy ditties, she wandered through her native woods, her long golden tresses disheveled and tangled with the fantastic anadems of wilding flowers that she wove for her fevered brow. Ofttimes, in half-lucid moments, she sought the green plat under the great plane-tree where she and Paris had first met and loved. There, soothed by the many-twittering music of the leaves vibrating in the breeze, and recalling by association the happy days she had once enjoyed in his society, but forgetting the way in which she had lost him, none enjoyed for a space a sort of respite from the worst paroxysms<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5784-00000075"/> oxysms of her madness. Then the ewes that she had been wont to tend came and nibbled the herbage around her, bringing their frisky lambkins as if to show them to her, or looking wistfully into her face, as though to inquire what could be the matter with their fair young shepherdess, and where had the shepherd gone who had piped mellow music to them, feeding at noon-time on the lush grass of the brookside.</p> 
               <p>For awhile, until the disorder of her mind came to its worst, when the sun began to slope towards the west, she daily returned from her roaming to the hut and the fold, to await the coming of the flock of Paris, and milked and gathered them in their wattled inclosure. But one by one the sheep ceased to come back at evening; unprotected by their shepherd, they strayed away into the thickets and were devoured by the wolves and the bears, or mingled with the flocks of other shepherds. But none all the same waited for them each evening before her cot, until the skimming swallows had gone to rest, and the cry of the eagles was heard no more from the eyries on the upper crags, and the bats came out from the caves and darted silently through the gloaming. Then the widowed nymph entered the hut and moaned herself into a broken rest. But as she became more wild,<pb n=""/> all memory of former habits and associations seemed, except at intervals, to lose their influence over her actions, and she wandered from her humble dwelling, and slept at night on the thick, soft, mossy bed at the foot of ancient beeches; or she reposed on the ferns that grew in the entrance of caverns where the dribbling of water dropping down the hollow stones soothed her to quiet dreams, while the brindled pards, sent by Pan to keep the disconsolate nymph from harm, paced with stealthy tread around her, and watched with vigilant eye until she awoke from slumber.</p> 
               <p>At other times, when none roamed through the gloom and solitude of the wooded glens, the ashen-hued, meek-eyed turtle-doves cooed their most plaintive notes, to soothe the grief of the melancholy nymph, who, like them, was a child of nature, a native of the leafy wilderness, and susceptible in her wildest moods to the calming influence of the harmonious voices of creation. Or the nightingale, herself love-lorn, in the hush of bosky dells by day, or from the trembling poplar in the breezeless night under the tranquil moon, warbled her richest and most pathetic songs when none was by, while all the near valleys caught the refrains of that magical tune and the trees stood motionless and enchanted to<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5784-00000076"/> listen. When none reclined her fair white form on the heights under the colonnades of the pine groves, and breathed the warm, soft wind that floated up hither from the far-off sea and the hazy plains below, then the clustered pines above moaned with her in her sorrow, and chanted a low, heart-thrilling strain that sang of years gone by and brought relief to her forlorn spirit, for it opened the fountain of her tears. Then the timid, agate-eyed hares stole out from the coppice, and showed their sympathy by <choice>
                     <sic>skiping</sic>
                     <corr>skipping</corr>
                  </choice> to her side that she might stroke their furry backs and know that she was pitied by them. Even the wild roses and harebells and violets and hyacinths seemed to spring up wherever she walked to diffuse their spicy fragrance for her.</p> 
               <p>Sometimes the wood nymphs and oreads with whom she had consorted before she lived with Paris, came and danced about her with knit hands and blithesome, tricksy voices, thinking with mirth and innocent glee to frighten away the disorder of her brain. But nothing now availed to restore to poor none that peace of mind which had once made her the merriest and loveliest of all who haunted the woods of Mount Ida. The years came and went unheeded by her; spring after spring the hazel-trees burgeoned and bloomed, and the wild geese, the pelicans icans, and the cranes winged their flight in long lines to the north, with a confused gabbling in the blue overhead; autumn after autumn the leaves were shaken down yellow and sere upon the dry, whistling grass, and the birds of passage flew by to the south, to the land where there is war between the cranes and the Pygmies; but the mind of none continued crazed and forlorn.</p> 
               <p>But a change came over her. Fate destined that her reason should be restored, and when many years had passed, none awoke from her long dream of despair, and became her former self once more. The shepherds now told her that she had been insane ever since her desertion by Paris, and that there was war in Troy, as they heard from the Greek and Trojan wood-cutters who came to the mountain to hew wood for the pyres that were lit after a battle. The war, they said, had arisen because Paris had carried away from her husband, Helen, reputed the most beautiful woman of the age, and that he had done so in accordance with the decrees of Fate, and for the same reason refused to restore the woman to Menelaus.</p> 
               <p>none was now able to hear these tidings with calmness, although they gave her inexpressible pain. Much she pondered them, until it seemed to her that if Helen was the wife of another<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5784-00000077"/> other and did not rightfully belong to Paris, it might not be so difficult a thing to persuade him to restore her; at least so it seemed to none's innocent heart. She thought that if she could see him again and speak with him, perhaps his old love would return, and he might be induced to give back the Greek woman and put an end to this bloody and calamitous war. Another reason why none longed to see him was because she knew that he must be often greatly exposed to the perils of the combat, in which he might receive grievous wounds, and was aware of many herbs that grew on the mountains, which, applied by her, could heal any hurt; and so long as he lived she could not avoid hoping that he might return to her, for she loved him so much that if he were reminded of this, his love for her must revive; for love often begets love, and had it not been for the fatal glamour of Aphrodite he never would have forsaken his wood nymph. After much hesitation,-for when she came to put her thoughts into action none doubted what would be her reception, or how she was to make her way to the city, where she had never been,-she at last resolved to go down to Troy and procure an interview with Paris.</p> 
               <p>It was a fine morning of summer, in the opening of the tenth year of the siege. Quiet it was<pb n=""/> and sultry withal; the green lizards basked in the sun on the glaring white stones; the sentinels nodded in the shadow of the towers on the ramparts of Troy, and idle men sprawled in the shelter of the Greek tents, which gleamed snowy and innumerable on the plain by the shore. On the deep blue sea beyond shone the sails of galleys returning from some foraging expedition to Imbros or up the Hellespont. The cicada's monotonous hum in the mulberry-trees, the dropping of the black berries on the shaded ground, and the whirr of the storks from their reedy nests on the house-tops, were the chief sounds that blended with the chatting of girls filling their earthen jars at the fountain in the market-place of Troy. Asses laden with panniers of grapes stood in the shady corners munching straw from the goats' hair sacks fastened to their noses, and whisking off the persistent flies with their tufted tails, while their masters lay on the ground asleep. Before an open door here and there might be seen a buxom woman, distaff in hand, spinning cotton,-her infant lying beside her on the sill, helpless in, the rigidity of swaddling bands. At the end of the narrow street could be perceived one of the city gates partly open, and the elders of the city nodding on the stone seats in the gate, through<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5784-00000078"/> which Mount Ida loomed blue and vaporous in the distance. If it had not been for a wounded man hobbling about the street now and then, or a troop of warriors stalking by with long, swinging step, to relieve the guard, a stranger would have supposed that peace reigned throughout the dominions of King Priam. It was one of those lulls in the storm of war, when both armies, wearied and worn, agree by tacit consent to rest for a while on their arms.</p> 
               <p>Out from the dusty footpath that led from the mountain, a peasant woman in rustic attire entered the Dardan Gate, holding a basket of fresh figs in her hand, that were shielded from the dust and heat by grape leaves. Walking boldly up to the grizzle-bearded, weather-grimed sentry, panting under the weight of his bronze cuirass, and propping himself with both hands on a long spear planted in the ground, the young woman said, "Friend, can you tell me how I can find Paris the son of Priam?"-"Hey, what, my mountain maid?" replied the soldier, rousing himself, startled both by the question and the beauty of the questioner. "So you wish to find Prince Paris, do you? Whence do you come, little bird, and what do you suppose he cares to see you for? Or what can you want of him? Better wer't for you to stay and keep me company<pb n=""/> here." So saying, the good-natured but rough campaigner stretched out his massive, brown, hairy arm to chuck her under the chin with his huge knuckle, but stepping lightly aside, she said, with a slight blush, "Do you know no better here in Troy, than to tease a poor, unprotected girl or give her uncivil answers to her questions."-"So ho! young woman; so you put on airs, do you? then don't bother me this hot morning. Go your way, or they will be taking you up for talking with a sentry on guard."</p> 
               <p>The peasant woman now turned for information to the old men sitting in the gates, who, after eying her with senile inquisitiveness, and trying vainly to find out what could be her errand, hailed a lad and bade him guide her to the Pergamus and the halls of Paris, where he would most likely be found reposing after the night's revelry. At the gate of the citadel the young woman gave the basket of figs to a dozing slave, bidding him deliver it to Paris, with the message that a woman of Mount Ida desired to see him on a matter of importance. After some surly hesitation, the boor concluded to comply with her request, rather to learn perchance what could be her object in coming there than from any unwonted hint of civility. Paris was lying on the beautifully mottled hide of a noble panther that<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5784-00000079"/> he had himself slain in the chase, in a desperate struggle in which the claws of the beast had left an indelible scar on his breast; he was now in the reactionary, self-dissatisfied, listless mood in which a debauch leaves a man who is not yet altogether destitute of virtuous impulses; and the strains of the cithern, over whose chords his fingers had been straying, had suggested to his mind the weird associations of former days. As in a dream, the years of his bucolic life on Mount Ida passed before him; he seemed to hear again the warble of his reed pipe and the bleat of his flocks on the slopes, to smell the fragrance of the pine cones, to see the dimpling circles in the pool under the plane-tree, to feel the soft arms of none around his neck, the press of her warm lips to his, and the sweet gaze of her blue eyes fixed on his own. So, when the slave boy entered and told him a woman of Mount Ida desired audience, Paris was in a measure prepared to meet none, that is, it immediately occurred to him that none but she could come from there to see him, and for a brief moment he was almost pleased by the idea of meeting her again. But other and more painful emotions succeeded, and it was not without considerable confusion that he was able to greet her.</p> 
               <p>In a simple but affecting way none related<pb n=""/> to Paris the story of her sorrows, so that he could not refrain from tears. She then said, "But I have not come to reproach you, Paris, for it may be that in all this we, you as well as I, are the victims of Fate; I come rather to tell you that I have a presentiment that in this year, and before many weeks have passed, you will be sorely, perchance mortally wounded. This you can avoid if you will only restore Helen to her husband, Menelaus; it may be hard for you to come to this, but by doing as I advise, you will save yourself from a great peril; you will bring peace on your country; the Greeks will return to their land beyond the seas, and all the Trojans will bless your name because you preferred their good to your own pleasure; and I will again be your wife, if that be any inducement, and will live with you here, or wherever it pleases you. Perhaps I am not as queenly as Queen Helen, but have not you yourself often called me fair, and can she love you more than I do? O Paris, but listen to my words and do as I say this only time, and what happiness may yet come to us all."</p> 
               <p>So lovely was her face as she spoke, her eyes flashing with deep meaning, her cheeks flushed with the earnestness of her appeal, and the accents of her voice so moving and so like the<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC5784-00000080"/> voice of other, better days, that Paris was half-inclined to yield a conditional promise that he would grant the petition of none. But while he hesitated with the unformed promise on his lips, and, taking the soft hand of the wood nymph in his, drew her towards him to kiss her once more, she, stepped back at the fall of female footsteps approaching, and said, "No, not while you company with that false woman can you kiss me; but when she is gone send for me and I will dwell at your side forever. And ere I go mark well the words I now speak. You will most likely be hurt in the terrible combat,-hurt so that none can heal you but I alone; then remember me and bid them bear you to the fountain under the plane-tree and I will heal you if it be not too late, and we will then live and love together as of yore, before the gods came to disturb our peace."</p> 
               <p>As she finished these brave words and turned to go, the curtain that concealed the doorway was raised by a white hand, and a stately and magnificent woman clad in an emerald-colored robe, caught over the shoulders by Sidonian clasps, a fillet of gold across her forehead, and massive bracelets on her bare and perfectly moulded arms, glided into the apartment, and fixing her keen, black eyes on the wood nymph<pb n=""/> with a glance of scorn that beclouded the serenity of her majestic brow, said to Paris, "Are you growing weary of me, that you needs must find solace from a peasant girl in my short absence?" And then she added with superb irony and disdain, "But perhaps 'tis a slave girl whom you intend to present to me for an attendant." Helen had previously heard whispers concerning none, and now shrewdly suspected, the peasant she found with Paris to be the wood nymph, and her jealousy, a passion that survives after love has expired, was kindled thereby and gave rise to language for which there was so little apparent cause.</p> 
               <p>Paris replied, "She is an old friend of mine, who has bethought herself to bring me a basket of fresh figs from Mount Ida."</p> 
               <p>Helen opened her mouth to make some bitter retort, and glanced again at none with unutterable hate; but the words died on her lips, and her proud eyes fell before the pure and penetrating gaze of the innocent and injured woman who had been the good genius of Paris in a happier existence. Involuntarily averting her face, Helen moved away, while none, with a sigh, raised the curtain and retired. But when she was gone, high words and many passed between<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC5784-00000081"/> the Spartan queen and her paramour, and it was some days before they were again outwardly reconciled. To say that the love of Paris was weakened by this scene would be hardly true, but Helen's heart was more than ever estranged.</p>

               <head>IX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">COMBAT OF THE RIVALS.</head> 
               <p>THE Greeks in one of their marauding expeditions had, as previously recorded, carried the city of Theb by storm, at a time when a large number of people had flocked to the place to attend a festival of Artemis and present rich offerings at her shrine. For this reason a great quantity of booty and many captives were taken on this occasion and divided among the victors. The fairest of the maidens was Chryseis, the daughter of Chryses, a priest of Apollo at the neighboring city of Chrysa. She was presented to Agamemnon as his share of the spoil. But several months after these events Chryses her father entered the Greek camp, and proceeding through the winding streets of this city of tents, reached the spacious pavilion of the King of Men. He there demanded and received an audience of Agamemnon, to whom he offered rich gifts of gold and related the sorrow he had suffered in the loss of his lovely and affectionate daughter.<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5784-00000082"/> As he told the sad story, leaning on his staff and tears moistening his snowy beard, the bystanders were moved by the tale, and their sympathy was increased when the curtain that partitioned the tent was raised and a young girl glided swiftly forth and threw herself on the old man's bosom and blended her tears with his. All looked to see Agamemnon yield to the old man's prayer, and, restoring Chryseis to her father, bid them go in peace.</p> 
               <p>But instead of this, Agamemnon replied, with his face blackened with frowns, "Presume no more, old man, on my good-will; but, as you value your life, leave my tent this instant, nor let me hear of you again prowling about the camp, exciting disorder with your querulous tongue. For neither your prayers, nor your bribes, nor yet your priestly insignia, shall cause me to give up your daughter. She is fair and worthy to be my companion, and shall surely return with me to Greece. Guards, put him forth, and see that the dotard returns no more to disturb our rest with his grumbling."</p> 
               <p>So Chryses departed the camp, but as he walked slowly towards Chrysa along the sounding sea-shore, he raised his voice in supplication to Apollo, beseeching him to send pestilence on the host of the Greeks in reprisal for the<pb n=""/> insults offered to his priest. In pursuance of this petition, a dreadful epidemic came upon the Greeks soon after, attacking first the mules, asses, and meat cattle, and finally destroying hundreds of the people. Day and night the sky was dimmed with the smoke of the funeral pyres.</p> 
               <p>Great was the consternation caused in the camp by this terrible calamity, which threatened the extermination of the invading host. Finally a council was appointed in the pavilion of Agamemnon, and all the chieftains assembled there to deliberate on the disastrous state of affairs. Achilles arose and recommended that advice on the subject should be obtained by consulting some wise and prudent seer, so that in case the pestilence had been sent by a deity on account of some flagrant sin, immediate means might be taken to appease the offended divinity by hecatombs of bulls offered in various parts of the camp.</p> 
               <p>After Achilles had sat down, Calchas the priest arose, and said that he could divulge the cause of the calamity and how it could be stayed; but before declaring himself he asked Achilles to assure him of his protection, as what he was about to say might so arouse the wrath of some in high authority as to endanger his sacred person. Achilles swore in the most vehement manner that he would take it upon himself to see<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5784-00000083"/> that not a hair on his head should be harmed, whatever he might choose to declare in the matter. Thus encouraged, Calchas said: "O chieftains of Greece, this pestilence is not the result of any duties left undone or any sacrifices unoffered; the only cause is the conduct of the King Of Men towards Chryses, the priest of Apollo; and until the maid is restored to her father without ransom, there can be no hope of deliverance from the calamity which overwhelms our host."</p> 
               <p>Scarcely had Calchas finished, when Agamemnon sprang to his feet, his brows black as night, his eyes flashing fire, and his voice trembling with rage; "Infamous liar, who, under the guise of a priest, are always bringing misfortunes upon me!" cried Agamemnon, in a tone that rang far over the camp. "Because I prefer the charms of Chryseis to the sordid gold of her father, must I be denounced by you, O prophet of evil, as the cause of the woes that befall the Greeks? Well, be it so; let the maiden be restored; better that I suffer rather than my valiant host; but know that in place of Chryseis I shall take from one of the chieftains some fair girl such as I may think fit to make good my loss."</p> 
               <p>When the King of Men had concluded his intemperate speech, Achilles rose and upbraided him for his selfish conduct. Agamemnon in reply<pb n=""/> ply said, "O Achilles, think not to deter me from my purpose by loud sounding words, but learn that Briseis whom you cherish and dearly love is the one whom I choose to be brought to my tent, if Chryseis is restored to Chrysa." Immediately there ensued a scene of uproar and confusion, in the course of which Achilles so far forgot himself as to draw his sword on the King of Men, but was induced to sheath it again without doing any injury to the object of his wrath; but he left the assembly and retired in a fury to the quarter of the fleet under his control, and ordered his Myrmidons to withdraw from the allied army and remain with him in their ships. Chryseis was sent back to Chrysa by sea; Briseis was taken from the tent of Achilles to the tent of Agamemnon; and the irate god, being appeased by the restoration of Chryseis, stayed the ravages of the plague.</p> 
               <p>As to the conduct of Agamemnon in this business, there is, unhappily, no room for doubt. It was not only odious, but also in the last degree injudicious. It is not easy to understand how he could be willing for such a cause to provoke the wrath and lose the aid of his most able captain, Achilles. But an evil demon seemed to have taken possession of Agamemnon for a while. However, he paid dear for his fault, which wellnigh resulted in the ruin of the Greek host.</p>

               <p>Soon after the events related above, Agamemnon dreamed that he beheld his army victorious, and Troy overthrown. Not doubting the prophetic truth of his vision, no sooner did he awake than he determined to put the glorious but unreal fantasies of his sleep into execution, although good generalship would have led him to see that he could choose no worse time to put his army in motion and take the offensive, for his best captain was brooding over his wrongs in a remote part of the fleet, and the whole army was disheartened by the absence of Achilles and the dreadful losses they had sustained from the plague. Indeed, it required all the address and wisdom of Ulysses, Nestor, and the other leaders, to turn the minds of the Greek warriors from their universal desire to return to their wives and children, and to rekindle martial fire in their souls in the stead of these unwarlike emotions. Thersites, a boisterous, self-inflated demagogue, much given to unprofitable talk, a representative of a class of popular guides, created by the gods in their inscrutable counsels, to bring confusion on the best ordered schemes of men by their selfish and ill-balanced verbosity, now incited the army to mutiny; but Ulysses quieted his bawling by some well-timed blows, and then by a very neat and effective appeal to the love of<pb n=""/> glory to which the Achaian heart ever responds with enthusiasm, aroused the host to advance to the approaching conflict with ardor, promising that their efforts should be crowned by the fall of Troy. Agamemnon seized the moment when his army received the speech of Ulysses with vast shouts of applause, and ordered them to advance. After deploying on the plain, the host was halted in line of battle. It was probably the plan of Agamemnon, either by this manuvre to challenge the Trojans to come out from behind their walls and fight in the open country in which case, the superiority of numbers would be in his favor; or if Hector refused to lead forth the garrison into the field, then to hazard the effect of another assault.</p> 
               <p>The Greek leader did not have long to wait in order to learn what action the Trojans would take. It seems that their chieftains were already holding a council of war in the spacious porch of Priam's palace, discussing the propriety of making a night attack on the Greek lines, when Polites, a son of Priam, who held a post of observation on the lofty funeral mound of setes, came in haste to announce that the Greek army was in motion, and that the plain seemed on fire with the blaze of innumerable spears. On learning these tidings, the chiefs in council, including Hector<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5784-00000085"/> decided at once that they ought to march forth and settle the fate of Troy on the plain; or the garrison, long cooped within the walls, would lose its courage and martial spirit, and finally fail even to resist a direct assault from the enemy. What they lacked in numbers would be amply made up, they considered, by the freshness of their troops, who had been long reposing in Troy, and were now chafing for the conflict, while the Greeks were exhausted by the harassing life they had led for over nine years and the depressing effects of a terrible epidemic.</p> 
               <p>The various bodies of allied forces gathered in the beleaguered town were accordingly ordered out, and, defiling through the gates, were marshaled opposite to the Greek host, amid clouds of dust that arose from the tramp of many thousands, and gleamed in the rays of the setting sun like dust of gold. The flank of each wing rested on one of the two gates nearest the enemy, which was thus well protected in the rear. By the time both armies had taken up their positions on the plain, the long summer day came to an end, and gray twilight drew her saffron-skirted and star-embroidered veil over the field that would soon be strewed with the dead. Silence brooded over the scene, broken only at intervals by the neigh of a charger, the bark of a<pb n=""/> distant shepherd dog, the hoot of an owl from a tower, or the mysterious, eerie whispering of the low night wind.</p> 
               <p>On the following morning Paris joined the Trojan army, fresh from the bath, the hair curling around his crested helmet in glossy ringlets. When he strode down the lines between the two armies, his tall and faultless person clad in a burnished suit of mail, an ivory-tipped bow and quiver on his left shoulder, a two-edged sword suspended at his side by a blue and gold embroidered baldric, two long spears in his right hand, new sandals on his feet, and, according to his wont when arrayed in his best, a panther's brown and yellow hide thrown negligently down his back and looped around the neck by a golden buckle, murmurs of admiration arose alike from friend and foe. But as Paris stalked before the Greeks and dared them to send forth a champion to meet him in single combat, Menelaus espied him as he came opposite the Spartan ranks. Fired with fury at the sight of the man who had wronged him and wrought such terrible woes, and who now impudently defied the boldest of the Greeks, Menelaus leaped from his chariot, and shouting that he, and he alone, would wreak vengeance on the faithless Trojan, ran forth to confront Paris in mortal conflict. But when<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5784-00000086"/> Paris perceived who it was that thus dared to fight him, his face turned to ashy paleness, and without waiting to meet Menelaus, he retreated hastily and sought refuge behind the Trojan lines. As Paris showed on many occasions that he was not only no coward, but was, on the contrary, one of the bravest of the Trojan leaders, it is most reasonable to conclude that his conduct on this occasion was caused by the voice of an inward monitor, a lingering sense of shame, and perhaps doubt of the favor of the gods, which made him distrust the result of an encounter with Menelaus. Perhaps, also, he shrank from slaying one whom he had already sufficiently injured. But whatever may be thought of the motives controlling the action of Paris, Hector could not permit such an exhibition of apparent pusillanimity in so prominent a person as his brother to pass without some effort to allay the disastrous effect it would surely produce on his army, which was about to engage the foe in a decisive battle. Therefore he approached Paris and sternly upbraided him for his unsteadiness in the field. This timely rebuke brought Paris to a sense of the very serious mistake he had committed, and that he must immediately take measures to neutralize its effect unless he desired to be branded as a caitiff, and, worse still, to<pb n=""/> see the Trojans disheartened by his example. Acknowledging the justice of Hector's reproof, Paris declared himself willing and anxious to send Menelaus a formal challenge to meet him in mortal combat before both armies, the destinies of Troy and the fate of Helen to be decided by the result of the duel. Overjoyed to find his brother in so brave a mood, Hector gladly conveyed the challenge to Menelaus, who as gladly accepted it, nothing doubting that he would be the victor, feeling strong in the justice of his cause; and great also was the rejoicing among all the Greeks and Trojans at the news, for both sides saw in the approaching arbitrament of war the final settlement of their difficulties and the return of peace.</p> 
               <p>But in order that there might be no loop-hole left whereby the defeated party could find some way of escape from keeping to the straight conditions of the combat, it was necessary to ratify and solemnize the stipulated terms with sacrifices and oaths, mutually offered and pronounced by the kings of Greece and Troy. For this purpose a swift messenger was dispatched to summon King Priam to appear on the field. Overcome with emotion natural in one of his age at the imminent danger to which his favorite son Paris was to expose himself, and by the near<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC5784-00000087"/> approach of the crisis which was to decide the fate of Troy, Priam mounted his chariot, and, accompanied by Antenor, was driven through the Trojan army into the centre of the interval between the two hosts, where Agamemnon, Ulysses, and Hector were awaiting his arrival. A black lamb and a white one had been already furnished by the Trojans, while the Greeks added a third; wine in long-necked amphor was also provided, and golden goblets for libations. On the arrival of Priam two heralds poured wine over the joined hands of Priam and Agamemnon, the representative leaders of the two nations; then Agamemnon with a small dagger cropped a few locks of wool from the foreheads of the victims, which was divided among those present. After this the Greek king raised his voice and cried: "O thou, the mightiest of celestial powers, immortal Jove, and all ye gods who rule this spacious orb, thou far-rolling sun, ye controllers of the floods, and ye gods, and furies of the infernal glooms, who wreak vengeance alike on kings and subjects whose lips have uttered perjured vows! now bear ye witness to these our oaths and covenant! If Menelaus falls beneath the spear of Paris, let the Trojan keep the woman and her treasures, while the Greeks return to Greece. But if Paris falls beneath my brother's<pb n=""/> spear, then let great Menelaus take the woman and the treasures, and after ages bear record of the deed. But if then the Trojans refuse to yield up the woman, let the sword be drawn anew and bloody battle prove which side deserves to win!"</p> 
               <p>After pronouncing this invocation to the gods, Agamemnon slew the three lambs, and both monarchs tasted wine from the same goblet, and poured the remainder on the ground, a libation to Jove, pronouncing together this awful imprecation: "Ye gods, even as this wine is poured out so may their blood be spilled who first break this league! may their wives become outcasts, and their race be lost in oblivion!"</p> 
               <p>When the preliminary rites were completed, King Priam excused himself from tarrying to witness the combat, pleading that old age made his heart weak when the life of his favorite son Paris was exposed to such peril. He therefore remounted his brazen chariot, and the well-trained steeds bore him back to the city. In the mean time, Helen, who was aware that both armies had taken the field and that a severe battle was about to follow, of which she was the primal cause, had retired to her chamber, and there, devoured by melancholy thoughts, wrought at her tapestry work, striving thus to obtain relief from her sad<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC5784-00000088"/> reflections. While she plied her needle, unmindful of the fair sky and balmy airs without, a messenger came to inform her that Menelaus and Paris were on the point of meeting in a mortal struggle which was to decide her fate and the destinies of Greece and of Troy. On hearing this her cheeks paled, and hastily rising, she drew a veil over her head, and followed the messenger through the streets that were now crowded with throngs pressing to the ramparts and gates to witness the fight on whose result so much depended. As Helen approached the Scan Gate her mien was so graceful and majestic, her beauty so astonishing, that even the elders gossiping on the stone benches in the gate, too decrepit to take part in the rigors of war, could not refrain from exclamations of admiration. Near the gate was a narrow stairway leading up to the ramparts. Mounting these steps, Helen, aided by her attendant, threaded her way among the women and children who were leaning against the battlements, and in the shadow of a fig-tree which grew out of a crevice where the mortar had crumbled and fallen from a joint in the massive wall, gained a post of observation whence, screened from the sun, she could observe what was going on below. At her feet stretched the Trojan lines, beyond was the arena where the<pb n=""/> combat was to take place; then her eyes rested on the spear-flashing hosts of Greece, flanked by the rows of snowy tents and black hulks, and far in the distance the blue sea glancing with white caps, Tenedos and the shores of Thrace lilac-hued in the offing. It was an imposing and magnificent spectacle; but it caused no pleasure in the heart of the fateful woman who under the fig-tree watched the momentous scene. What strange, terrible emotions racked her heart, what anguish dried the tears that would have moistened her lids as she gazed with parched, terror-stricken eyes, and reflected that her beauty had been the cause of such woes, her lawless crime the origin of the bloody combat she was to behold.</p> 
               <p>But now a buzz of expectation from the assembled multitudes informed Helen that the lists had been marked out by Hector and Ulysses. The lots were next shaken in a brazen helmet, and Hector, turning away his head, drew the lot which was to decide whether of the champions was to have the first cast of the spear. Paris was doomed to draw the fatal chance. Then from their respective lines the two champions advanced and entered the lists, resplendent in glittering armor, and prepared to fight, and win or die, for the love of Helen. Moving swiftly forward<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5784-00000089"/> ward two or three steps on a run, poising his long sharp-headed spear over his head, and bringing to bear all the added force of the impetus thus gained, Paris hurled the missile at Menelaus with terrific power. The point struck the buckler of the Greek with a far-resounding clang, but failing to pierce its brass-plated surface of proof, bounded back blunted, and fell harmless to the ground. Then Menelaus, uttering a brief prayer for celestial aid, balanced his spear, and, with confidence in his look, approached rapidly in his turn to within a few paces of his antagonist and cast his weapon with such steadiness and strength that it pierced the shield of Paris, who firmly awaited the blow, and, striking his corselet, glanced downwards and would have severely torn his thigh, if he had not inclined suddenly to the right and escaped with a slight flesh wound. Before Paris could fairly recover himself and draw his blade, Menelaus was upon him sword in hand, and dealt him a staggering stroke on the helmet which would have cloven his skull, if the treacherous steel had not struck slightly sidewise and shivered into fragments. Uttering a horrible imprecation, Menelaus seized the crest of his opponent's helmet with both hands, and throwing him to the earth, held him at such advantage that nothing could have saved<pb n=""/> Paris from being dragged straight into the Greek lines and slain, if the thong which bound the helmet under his chin had not luckily burst. As the helmet flew off his head, Paris sprang to his feet, with face bloody, his eyes almost blinded with dust, and his shining armor smeared with dirt and gore. Picking up one of the spears which lay on the ground, Paris hurled it at Menelaus without other effect than a dent on his helmet, and then sought refuge in the Trojan lines, unwilling longer to maintain the fight, as his ill fortune had made him suspicious and fearful of the wrath of the gods, who seemed unfavorable to his success. Threading his way from rank to rank, amidst the ill-suppressed murmurs of the Trojan warriors, Paris entered the Scan Gate and sought concealment in his own halls, there to hide from the eyes of men the mortification which, vain and arrogant and selfish though he was, cut him to the soul, for he was a brave man, if unfortunate on this occasion.</p> 
               <p>Helen had witnessed the whole combat, and her admiration for Menelaus was rekindled by the courage with which he had fought to win her back, nor was the success that attended him without its effect in causing this revulsion of feeling towards the victor, for, so far as mere valor was in question, Paris had stood up to the fight in the face of adverse circumstances firmly<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5784-00000090"/> and manfully. But him she now regarded with contempt that overbalanced in her bosom what little of love for him remained, until she saw him passing under the gate bloody from the strife, and recollected that he had spilt his blood for her, and that while she continued to abide in Troy, she ought to be somewhat kind to him, since she, scarcely less than he, had been responsible for his success in laying suit to her heart and the subsequent results of their guilty attachment. She dimly saw, if not ready to acknowledge the truth, that the sharer of his unlawful pleasures should also submit with him to share the consequences of their mutual indulgence. Thus, although from this day her waning love for Paris visibly declined, still, moved by the pity natural to the feminine soul, and a lingering sense of justice, Helen descended from the ramparts and returned sorrowfully to the palace to comfort Paris and minister to his wants. But when again in his presence, she yielded once more to the influence of the glamour and fascination of his person and manner, which was so especially his, and which gave him in intercourse with others a charm, a power in dealing with his fellows unpossessed by many of superior worth and intellect, and made him a source of wonder to those who failed to perceive that mankind is composed in general of two classes, those who influence and those who are<pb n=""/> influenced, and that the success of the former is not seldom occasioned by causes extremely occult and beyond the comprehension of such as, consider that the influence of character upon character can or should result from mental and moral power alone. In the case of Paris, the possession of this subtle force was doubtless due mainly to sheer will, personal attractions, and intense egotism, dangerous elements when combined in the same individual and unbalanced by a proportionate measure of intellect and virtue.</p> 
               <p>But although swayed for the time by the amorous caresses of Paris almost into the belief that she loved him, and while receiving and returning his endearments, Helen could not dispel the shadow which clouded her emotions, the keen disappointment in the result of the recent combat, whose undecided turn but prolonged her suspense and postponed the close of this disastrous war and her return to Greece, now becoming the paramount aim of her existence. Knowing the fixed determination of Paris, she foresaw that, in spite of his discomfiture, he would contrive to raise new obstacles to her return, and would prefer to break the sworn conditions of the combat rather than restore her to Menelaus. While he remained alive she could entertain little hope of ever seeing her native land again.</p>

               <head type="sub">PANDARUS SHOOTS ONCE TOO OFTEN.</head> 
               <p>AFTER the discomfiture of Paris, both armies naturally expected nothing less than to see Helen and her treasures restored to Menelaus, and harmony again bringing happiness and prosperity to the troubled nations. Although mortified by the unexpected result of the duel and the conduct of their champion, the Trojans had too much regard for the solemn oaths given by both parties and too earnest a longing for peace, to be inclined to refuse to carry out their part of the stipulations of the combat. Consequently when Menelaus, confiding in the truce between both armies, stepped forward majestically and demanded the restoration of Helen because he had rightfully won her by the prowess of his good right arm, while shouts of applause from the Greek hosts rent the skies, even some of the Trojans mingled their cries of admiration and approval with the voices of the foe. Hard as it was to accept defeat and be forced by the decision<pb n=""/> cision of arms to give up the woman, after such stubborn resistance, yet the recent combat had been so fairly conducted and the cause of Menelaus was really so just, that Hector and the other Trojan chieftains saw no good reason for refusing to fulfill their condition of the covenant. Therefore Hector, accompanied by a herald, advanced to meet Menelaus and arrange with him the day when Helen should be restored to her husband and the Greeks leave the Trojan shores.</p> 
               <p>At this auspicious but critical moment an unforeseen circumstance destroyed in an instant the hope for a speedy peace which inspired both armies. The spirit of mischief entered into the heart of Pandarus, who commanded the Zeleian allies stationed near the centre of the Trojan host. Although brave and skillful as a soldier, and an excellent archer withal, Pandarus always bore the reputation of being addicted to low pleasures and degrading pursuits, and now, influenced by an impulse of unusual recklessness and malevolence, he outdid himself by an act which branded his name with eternal infamy. "What a fine thing would it be," he said to himself, "if I could put an arrow through the heart of Menelaus, who is stalking yonder so fiercely. Whiz flies the shaft, he falls, and with im- falls the cause of the war; for who of the Greeks, Menelaus<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5784-00000092"/> laus being dead, will care to shed his blood for the frail beauty; and the name of Pandarus will henceforth become famous." Without once heeding the truce so solemnly declared, Pandarus had no sooner thought thus, than he put his right hand into his quiver and drew forth a cluster of feathered arrows pointed with steel. After selecting the best one in such a manner as not to attract attention to what he was about, he suddenly placed the notch on the string of his bow, which was made of the polished horns of an ibex he had slain in the mountains and was tipped with gold, and drew it to his right ear, then, taking quick aim and saying, "Here's to the health of the most noble Menelaus!" let fly at the king of Sparta.</p> 
               <p>The arrow was aimed for the heart, and pierced the corselet in that region, but the sword-belt crossing the breast, and stiff with embroidery of gold thread, broke the force of the shaft, and the point inflicted a severe but not a fatal wound, as it failed to touch a vital part, and the barb was not buried in the flesh.</p> 
               <p>At sight of the blood coursing down the side of Menelaus, cries of rage arose from the Greeks, while the Trojans stood aghast at this act of unheard-of folly and wickedness, whose far reaching consequences for evil were evident to the<pb n=""/> dullest perception. Hector started back in dismay, loudly asserting his entire ignorance as to the author of this mischief, while Agamemnon rushed from the Greek lines to support his wounded brother, calling down the most awful woes on the Trojans for their perfidy, which he very naturally thought, in the heat of the moment, had been planned by them all, and immediately dispatching a herald to fetch Machaon, the chief surgeon of the Greek army. But even at this critical moment the well-known integrity of Hector might have given effect to his protestations of innocence if Pandarus, fearful of the results to himself if the truce were continued, and he were brought to account for his officious roguery, had not ordered his troop to shoot their arrows at the Greeks, on pretense that he saw them aiming at Hector. Further conference was after this impossible. Hector and Agamemnon retired in mutual wrath and sorrow to their respective commands, and a general battle immediately followed.</p> 
               <p>In this conflict the main body of the Trojans for a short time held their position between the Simois and Scamander, but the superior numbers of the Greeks, led with much skill by Agamemnon and aroused to fury by the treachery of Pandarus, gradually forced the Trojans to fall<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5784-00000093"/> back under the walls of Troy. There Hector succeeded in rallying his army, reminding them that their dread enemy, Achilles, was not in the field, and that the sun, yet high in the heavens, gave them ample time to snatch victory from the enemy before night. But the slaughter had been terrible, Pandarus, the guilty cause of the battle being among the slain; and the result of the conflict was so doubtful that Hector agreed with his brother Helenus, the priest, that it would the well to have solemn prayers offered in the temples of Troy, by Hecuba and the Trojan matrons, for the safety of the city.</p> 
               <p>Both armies, exhausted by their efforts, rested for a short time on their arms by common consent, while Hector, slinging his vast shield over his back, strode like a lion into the town. On reaching the open space around the public fountain, shaded with beech and plane-trees, he was surrounded by women who were anxiously grouped there waiting for tidings from the battle. To their earnest appeals for news concerning their husbands and sons and brothers, and the fortunes of the conflict, he answered that the result was uncertain and that they must offer up supplications to the gods. Thence the great Hector sought the palace, where his fond, anxious mother pressed him long to her heart, and<pb n=""/> entreated him to lay aside his armor and refresh himself with the wine which she offered him to drink. To this he made reply: "My mother, wine is not for the warrior who would retain his senses for the dread requirements of battle. I advise you to lead the Trojan matrons as suppliants to the temple of Pallas, bearing a sacred robe for her shrine and burning fragrant perfumes there, while I go to arouse Paris to his duty at this the crisis of his country's fate."</p> 
               <p>Then crossing the court-yard of the palace, Hector entered the apartments of Paris and Helen. Passing into the lofty hall where his brother was reposing himself after the combat, on a couch of polished olive-wood and ivory, apparently unmindful, in the arms of Helen, that the Trojans were bleeding by thousands in his cause, Hector glanced scornfully at the glittering armor flung idly in the covers of the apartment. Indignantly planting his heavy spear on the tesselated floor with a loud clang, he said resentfully: "Is this the time for you to show your hatred to Troy, O Paris! Must you by your misconduct combine with the Greeks to make me believe that you seek to dishearten the Trojans and overthrow our city! Have you forgotten that the Trojans bleed for you? Is there no gratitude in your soul for the sufferings endured<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5784-00000094"/> dured on your account! If you would not see the flames bursting over these walls, and your name consigned to eternal disgrace, gird on your idle sword, and aid me to hurl back the foe to their fleet. Brave, I know you to be, but prone to indolence and sensual indulgence; then arise and exert yourself now if ever, and by new exploits regain your past glory, and aid in the destruction of the Greeks."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, my brother Hector, what you say is but too true," replied Paris. "But you mistake when you think me indifferent to the fate of Troy. A mortification such as never crimsoned your face, sent me to hide here out of sight of men. But now I go with you; hasten back to the field and I will follow as soon as I have buckled on my armor. Never again shall you find me a laggard in my country's battles."</p> 
               <p>Helen interrupted him, bemoaning "the destiny which had made it her doom to be united to such an effeminate warrior as Paris and to bring such woes on the nations." But Hector, thinking, perhaps, that she upbraided Paris before a third person in language too strong for one united tot him so intimately and peculiarly, gave her but brief answer, and hastened to find his wife, Andromache, in his own apartments at the further end of the Pergamus. But on arriving there he<pb n=""/> found her not whom he sought, but only one or two attendants loitering disconsolate about the silent halls. On inquiring for Andromache, he was told that, too anxious quietly to remain at home while Hector was fighting, she had repaired to the city walls, accompanied by the young Astyanax and his nurse. Swiftly darting from street to street, Hector reached the Scan Gate, and bounding eagerly up the stairway, found Andromache in the tower over the gate, gazing tearfully on the scene of battle.</p> 
               <p>With a joyful exclamation Andromache sprung to meet her husband and clasped her arms about his neck. For a while the stern warrior, on whose shoulders rested the destinies of Troy, relaxed the iron expression that knit his brows, and laying care aside, caressed his lovely wife in the most affectionate manner, endeavoring to soothe and to comfort her. Reminding him that she was an orphan, with none to care for her or for her to love except him, she besought him to leave the guidance of the army in the field to others, and as his life was so indispensable to the safety of Troy, to remain within the walls and there take measures for the preservation of the city. But he gently replied that it would be impossible for him, both for his own renown and for the good of his country, to withdraw<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC5784-00000095"/> from the field; although, with a presentiment of his approaching doom, he foretold with unfaltering tongue his own death, the fall of Troy, and the too probable fate of the wife he loved better than life. Then, as if to soften the effect these words might have on her desponding soul, the hero turned and stretched out his stalwart arms to clasp his boy. But the child, affrighted by the horse-hair crest shaking on his father's helmet, clung crying to the nurse, and would not come to Hector. Glancing at Andromache with a pleased smile, Hector put off the helmet; then took his boy, and after kissing him fondly, held him up and prayed Heaven to watch over him, to make him a worthier and a greater warrior than his father, the defender of Troy in a later age, and the solace of his mother's declining years. After restoring the child to the nurse, Hector attempted once more to comfort Andromache, bidding her trust that all would yet issue favorably; he then put on the helmet once more, and bade her farewell. With fast-flowing tears, Andromache returned to the palace, but too fully persuaded that she would never again meet Hector alive.</p> 
               <p>On descending to the Scan Gate, Hector encountered Paris armed and going forth to battle. Concealing, under an aspect of cheerfulness, the<pb n=""/> profound and melancholy emotions felt by both, the two brothers strode forward with rapid and unfaltering steps to take part again in the conflict on that plain where they had so many years before contended for the black bull in the games. Skirmishing was going on along the lines, when Hector reached the front, and both armies were preparing to resume the contest with more energy than ever. But, after a hasty consultation with Helenus, Hector thought it well not to test the valor of his wearied and out-numbered army any further on that day, but rather to gain time for them to recover from their fatigue and dismay. For this purpose, he boldly stepped forth into the narrow space that separated the hostile hosts, unmindful of the darts and arrows that were flying through the air. His serene and commanding mien inspired awe, while his manner and gestures showed that he desired to address the Greeks. Silence being therefore enjoined by order of Agamemnon, Hector, in a voice that rang along the Greek ranks like thunder, challenged them to send out a champion to meet him in single combat ere the sun go down. Hector was well aware that while his equals might be found, only Achilles could surpass him among the Greeks, and Achilles was now absent from their army; they, also, were too conscious of the<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC5784-00000096"/> fact, for their bravest stood aghast at the challenge of the magnificent hero of Troy. Discomfiture seemed to await the warrior who should dare to compete with the Trojan champion. While the Greek chiefs thus hesitated, Menelaus, although wounded by the arrow of Pandarus, offered himself to redeem the honor of the Greek name. But this proposal, and the reproaches of Nestor of Pylos, brought the other chieftains to their senses, and nine at once cried out their willingness to meet Hector. Their names were placed in a helmet, and the lot fell to Ajax Telamon, a captain of vast size and physically inferior only to Achilles in the Greek army, but lacking the intellectual grasp of Hector. He advanced to encounter his antagonist with a boastful speech more worthy of lesser warriors. But both combatants fought with sublime courage and dexterity, until night set in. Then heralds from either army interposed their staves between the crossing swords and put an end to a struggle whose result seemed doubtful and useless in the shades of night. Ajax and Hector separated by mutual consent and with increased respect accorded to each by both armies.</p> 
               <p>That night a council was held in the tent of Agamemnon. The indecisive battle of the previous day had been so fierce and bloody, and the<pb n=""/> result of the next fight was so dubious, that, by the advice of Nestor, it was decided to throw a line of intrenchments around the fleet at once, so that, in case of defeat, their vessels might not be captured and burned, and their return to Greece cut off. The Trojans also held a council in the pavilion of Priam near the gate of the citadel. The council was confused and disorderly, for the slaughter of the day had also unnerved the Trojans, and no less a matter was now discussed than the restoration of Helen and her treasures. Antenor, as usual, was the leader of this temporizing movement, to which, as afterwards appeared, he was secretly prompted by Helen; but Paris refused to listen to the proposal.</p> 
               <p>"What," cried he "would you be forced by arms to do what we refused to yield in time of peace! Troy, the gods be thanked, has not yet fallen so low. I appeal to my royal father to protect me from being forced to hearken to any more words on this unseasonable subject. Helen shall never leave Troy, shall never leave me, never while Paris lives to possess, to defend, and to love her. As for her treasures, let those be restored to the sordid Spartan, and, for that matter, you may also carry him my gold and Tyrian robes and gems; but as for Helen, I swear by<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC5784-00000097"/> the immortal gods that he who first talks again in my hearing of restoring her to the Greeks, shall die! Not even the gray beard of yon driveling dotard, not thy white locks, Antenor, shall save thee from my wrath, if"-</p> 
               <p>"Paris! my son Paris!" cried the venerable Priam, interrupting him in a voice tremulous with trepidation,-"Paris, remember these are Trojans whom you address in language so untimely; they have their rights as well as you, my son." After administering this mild rebuke, Priam, seeing the uselessness of further discussion, dismissed the council. Whatever may be thought of the conduct of Paris in seducing Helen to leave Sparta and plunging his country in the horrors of war rather than abandon her, there is however a certain sublimity about the persistency of his devotion to that erring woman which gleams with lurid radiance through the clouds that have blackened his character, the more noble because evidences were not wanting to arouse suspicions in his mind that Helen had by this time not only repented of leaving Sparta, but regarded him with indifference if not aversion, and was perhaps willing to betray him and the Trojans on the first favorable occasion for the sake of returning to Greece. During the night council just described, she was a listener, crouching muffled and invisible in the shadow<pb n=""/> of Priam's pavilion. When she heard the violent speech of Paris, which closed all hope of her restoration by any act of his, she trembled with the violence of her anger and returned to her apartments with a settled purpose to free herself from his power, whatever be the cost. Paris found her in this state of mind when he retired from the council, in order to sup before going again to the field. With some difficulty, Helen dissembled her emotions, although when he said to her tenderly, "My Helen, why art thou so pale? Art ill? or fearest thou, perhaps, the result of to-morrow's battle. Fear not; the gods will decide the combat for the right, and Troy shall win. Not yet has come the hour that parts us."</p> 
               <p>"Aye," she replied significantly, "the gods will decide. But I fear not for you; you know well how to escape the perils of battle."</p> 
               <p>"Helen, thou canst not love me, to taunt me as you do so often, these weary days. Only thou darest to reproach Paris with cowardice; thou for whom Paris seeks the bloody field, and 'twas not thus when we first met and loved."</p> 
               <p>"Think as you choose about my love, I never said I loved you not," replied Helen, coldly.</p> 
               <p>Paris left her, with a sigh, wondering in his mind what could have occurred to make her manner even more forbidding than had been its wont of late.</p>

               <head>XI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">STORMING OF THE FLEET.</head> 
               <p>ON the morning following the events related in the previous chapter, a herald was dispatched by Priam to Agamemnon offering to restore the treasures of Menelaus together with the riches of Prince Paris, as Paris had suggested on the previous night, and to propose a truce for the purpose of burning the dead. The former proposal was rejected with scorn, but an armistice was readily granted, Agamemnon nobly exclaiming, "We grudge no funeral sacrifices to the dead." The better part of three days both armies devoted to burning the slain; but in addition to this, a large body of the Greeks was detailed to surround their fleet with a fosse and a rampart of earth. On the fourth day battle again raged over the plain. A tremendous thunder-cloud arose from the sea and broke over the heads of the fighting hosts. They fought enveloped in the gloom of the storm, whose long-reverberating peals crashed above the din of the conflict, while<pb n=""/> the blinding sheet lightning flashed its lurid light in the angry faces of the combatants and on the upturned ghastly features of the slain, and the rain fell in masses which made the ground slippery, and swelled the Simois and Scamander until the tawny floods overflowed the banks and washed away many a stark corpse to the sea.</p> 
               <p>But during all this uproar of the elements and of man, Hector lost not control of himself, but, ably assisted by Paris, who led the right wing of the Trojan army, animated his troops and so well manuvred them that, although superior in numbers, the Greeks were driven back on their entrenchments. Prodigies of valor were performed on both sides during the day. Nestor very nearly fell a victim to the shafts of Paris, who slew one of his chariot horses, and would have inevitably put an end to the old hero himself if Diomedes had not bravely come to the rescue and given him a seat in his own chariot.</p> 
               <p>That night the Trojans bivouacked under arms, snatching their frugal meal by innumerable watchfires, whose ruddy gleam paled the cold stars which twinkled in the now serene and unclouded skies; the war-horses champed the barley as they stood by the chariots, and neighed as if looking forward with fierce joy to the morrow's victory. All were ready at a moment's warning<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC5784-00000099"/> to rush on the invaders, and prevent them from launching their galleys and putting to sea, should such be their intention; nor was this an unfounded suspicion, for Agamemnon did actually propose, in a council of war summoned that night in his tent, that the Greeks should abandon the siege as hopeless, and return home. But his advice was overruled, and a deputation was sent instead to beg Achilles to return and restore victory to the Greek arms by his invincible presence. Achilles, however, still firmly and sternly refused to aid the monarch who had robbed him of his beloved Briseis.</p> 
               <p>After the return of the deputation reporting the ill-success they had met at the tent of Achilles, Agamemnon lay groaning on his couch unable to sleep for anxiety regarding the morrow's conflict and the fate of the army under his command. Overpowered with the sense that on his action depended the destinies of Greece, he finally arose to summon another council,and, threading his way through the night-darkened camp, visited the leading chieftains in succession and arousing them from the heavy slumbers caused by the toils of war, bade them speedily gather at his pavilion to decide on some precautionary measure. Never, he said, had such prodigies of slaughter been performed by a mere<pb n=""/> mortal man undescended from the gods, as he had that day witnessed wrought by the prowess of mighty Hector, and something must speedily be devised to check his victorious career or destruction awaited the hosts of Greece. Hastily the chiefs assembled, and Nestor, who, on account of his age could easily be excused from such a hazardous enterprise, suggested that a spy should be sent into the lines of the Trojans, who were separated from the Greeks only by a small interval covered with the slain, and learn if possible what were the plans of the Trojan leader. Diomedes gladly volunteered, but selected Ulysses to accompany him, whose peculiar temperament would be very useful on such an occasion. The latter readily agreed to go, and the two heroes, armed with the needed weapons, and, better still, with stout hearts and cool heads, started forth in the gloom of night on their hazardous errand. As they left the camp they heard on their right the cry of a heron rising at their approach but invisible in the darkness; cheered by the favorable omen, they went lightly forward, carefully picking their way among the corpses thickly strewn on the ground, and sometimes scaring a vulture or a buzzard, whose dusky wings were vaguely discerned fanning the faces of the slain. All was silent and mournful on that bloody field;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC5784-00000100"/> the living and the dead, friend and foe were alike wrapped in Lethean slumbers, alike forgetful of the dreadful day just gone and unmindful of the grim and uncertain morrow.</p> 
               <p>But it happened that Hector had also in the mean time summoned a council of war, and decided to send a spy to the enemy's camp, in order to learn whether the Greeks intended to face the Trojans again or were about to betake themselves to the fleet and return to Greece. Looking around his assembled chiefs, Hector asked who would accept this perilous but honorable duty, promising that he who would bring back the desired information should be rewarded with the famed steeds and chariot of Achilles; he did not add, "when these expected trophies were captured," for there were not wanting many in the Trojan army who, after their surprising successes, considered as certain the overthrow and flight of the invaders. Dolon volunteered to proceed to the tent of Agamemnon and discover his designs, and boldly set out towards the Greek lines. But he was intercepted by Diomedes and Ulysses, who, perceiving his approach before they were observed by him, stooped and concealed themselves behind a heap of corpses until he had passed, and then started in pursuit. He, on hearing their steps behind him, naturally thinking<pb n=""/> ing they were from the Trojan army, waited for them, and was then easily captured. Addressing the Trojan with craft, the Greek spies learned from him that the Trojans had sentinels stationed to guard their ranks, but that the allies having less at stake than the Trojans, were incautiously sleeping on their arms, both cavalry and foot, without setting a watch; and that on the extreme right lay Rhesus, king of Thrace, who had that night arrived with a large force of auxiliaries, and with a pair of steeds white as driven snow and fleet as the wind, steeds of inestimable price; for an oracle had said that Troy should never fall if they drank the water of the Xanthus and pastured on the grass of the meadows of Troas. Having obtained this important information, Diomedes and Ulysses slew the miserable Dolon, and offered his weapons as a sacrifice to Pallas, with a prayer to her that she would render their expedition successful. The spies found everything as described by Dolon,-the allies asleep, the Thracians on the right, Rhesus and his steeds in the midst of them, he slumbering on the ground and the horses harnessed to his chariot, ready for the alarm of battle. Moving carefully and noiselessly among the sleeping ranks, Diomedes slew twelve of the sleeping Thracians, Ulysses drawing away the corpses and laying<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC5784-00000101"/> ing them aside so that the horses might not be startled by the sight of the carnage. After Rhesus himself was slain, Diomedes and Ulysses, as yet undiscovered, mounted his chariot and drove the fateful horses toward the Greek camp, which they succeeded in reaching without molestation, although the rumbling of the wheels gradually aroused the sleeping ranks, and filled them with consternation and dismay at the courage of those who had dared this terrible and heroic deed. Morning was already dawning on the hills, when Nestor and Agamemnon and the other chieftains, who had been anxiously awaiting the return of the emissaries, heartily welcomed them back to the camp, and marveled at the narration of their exploit and the splendor of the noble steeds that they brought with them. Diomedes and Ulysses then descended to the shore and washed off in the sea the sweat and gore from their limbs, thereafter anointing themselves with amber-colored oil of olive and seeking repose in sleep.</p> 
               <p>Great was the consternation in the Thracian lines when they were aroused by the noise of the retreating chariot, and discovered the death of their king and the loss of his fate-bearing steeds; but the panic which might have pervaded the Trojan host after this inauspicious event was averted by the timely suggestion made by Helenus<pb n=""/> enus the soothsayer, that there was yet time to retake the horses and give them of the water of Xanthus and the herbage of Troas, which would insure the safety of Troy.</p> 
               <p>It is not within the scope of this narrative to enter into a detailed account of the battles which followed; it suffices to relate that the Greeks, flushed by the successful midnight excursion of Ulysses and Diomedes, resumed the offensive, while Hector contented himself with holding his forces on the defensive until Agamemnon was wounded and forced to leave the field. Hector then advanced to the charge, bearing back the Greeks, although in superior numbers, and obliging them to retire behind the line of entrenchments they had recently constructed. Paris greatly distinguished himself by severely wounding Diomedes, and Machaon the chief leech of the Greek army, who were pierced by arrows, Paris being excellently skilled in archery. After terrible fighting, Sarpedon, chieftain of the Lycian allies, one of the noblest of the many heroes who fought on the Trojan side, and who was afterwards slain by Patroclus, forced a breach, while Hector burst one of the gates. In swarmed the Trojans, footmen and charioteers, through the breaches and over the ramparts, and thundered around the ranks of stranded galleys like<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC5784-00000102"/> the lashing surges of the storm-beaten Euxine, bearing aloft torches of pitch-pine which they hurled into the vessels, setting some of them on fire, and bringing the Greek expedition to the brink of ruin.</p> 
               <p>But when the flames and black clouds of smoke burst from the galley of Ajax and threatened to consume the fleet, Achilles, who from his deck had been a keen observer of the conflict, saw with his eagle eye that the decisive moment had arrived, and that instant action was needed to save the Greek army from utter destruction. But still hesitating to go in person to the aid of Agamemnon, he yielded to the suggestions of Nestor and permitted his best beloved friend, Patroclus, to put on the matchless Achillean panoply, and thus personifying Achilles himself, lead the Myrmidons to the rescue. Before they started, Achilles took a choice golden goblet, the gift of his mother, Thetis, and carefully rinsing it, offered a libation of wine to Jove, whom he besought to watch over the destinies of his friend, and bring him victorious again from the field. He then tersely addressed his warriors: "Myrmidons,-You have often murmured against me in that I have kept you here inactive while the rest of the Greeks were fighting. Behold, here is the occasion to prove your<pb n=""/> mettle and to win deathless renown." But these redoubtable heroes needed not the incitement of their leader; fresh and burning to conquer, they sprang forth to the shock of arms.</p> 
               <p>The Trojans, exhausted by the desperate resistance they had encountered in their assault on the Greek lines, although on the point of achieving complete success, had reached the critical moment when a trifling adverse circumstance might fill them with dismay, and precipitate their defeat. Hector, with the experienced eye of a skillful general, perceived that they began to waver, and although himself scarce recovered from the effect of the tremendous shock of a large stone hurled against his corselet by Ajax with all the added strength of despair, was devising means to infuse fresh ardor into his dispirited ranks, when the huge form of Patroclus, resplendent in the dazzling armor and mounted in the chariot of Achilles, which was propelled by a pair of pied horses, appeared in sight, rushing to the field followed by the Myrmidons, singing fierce, exultant pans of war and victory. The Trojans naturally mistook Patroclus for Achilles; a frightful panic overwhelmed their ranks and they turned and fled; a confused rout of men, and horses, and chariots, they rushed from the Greek entrenchments and flew over<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC5784-00000103"/> the corpse-strewn plain towards Troy, with a terrible clamor. Hector in vain strove to rally the fugitive host; shielded by his broad hide-bound buckler, he defended the rear, and sought to check the impetuous advance of the Greeks, who were raging to revenge their losses. Many brave men and famous went down before the irresistible spear of Patroclus, and he lacked but little of entering the Scan Gate and capturing Troy. But there Hector was at last able to bring some of the Trojans to a stand, and after a short but varying conflict succeeded in giving the fatal blow which brought the short but glorious career of Patroclus to a close. Hector speedily stripped him of his armor, which was borne to the Pergamus as a matchless trophy; but the mangled corpse was rescued by Menelaus and Ajax Telamon, after a long and severe struggle, in which the Trojans pressed hard upon the Greeks, and strove to snatch the body from their grasp as they retreated towards their camp. The doubtful conflict only ceased when Achilles, informed of the fight going on for possession of the body of his friend, arose in the majesty of his wrath and sorrow, and, unarmed as he was, mounted the rampart and shouted words of courage to the Greeks. The spectacle of his huge form sharply outlined and towering vast against the setting sun<pb n=""/> that was at his back and illumined his long, wind-tossed hair, and the sound of his well known and terrible voice, made the Trojans quake with terror; they speedily relaxed their hold of the much-contested corpse, and the Greeks then bore it to the high-beaked Myrmidonian fleet, together with the chariot and steeds of Achilles.</p>

               <head>XII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">HECTOR.</head> 
               <p>WHEN Antilochus the son of Nestor brought to Achilles the tidings of the fall of Patroclus and the loss of his armor, the son of Peleus strewed dust on his head and groveled on the earth, loudly lamenting. But his mother, Thetis, the silver-footed Nereid who dwelt in the emerald caverns of the deep sea, heard the wailing of her afflicted son, and bidding her troop of attendant nymphs follow her, arose to the shore near the Greek camp. With ordered step the procession of Nereids came to the tent of Achilles, where his mother blended her tears with his. She consoled him by assuring him that while he was destined to see a speedy termination of his days, it was yet fated that he should live to avenge the fall of Patroclus and slay the redoubtable Hector. But she bade her son avoid engaging in the conflict until she could procure for him a suit of armor equal to that which he had lost. She then dismissed her<pb n=""/> band of nymphs to their ocean caves and herself ascended to Olympus, where she waited on Vulcan, a cunning and enthusiastic artificer as well as a god. Him she found at his forge in his brazen abode; he gave Thetis a cordial welcome, and joyfully undertook to make at once a suit of armor that should be unsurpassed in workmanship, and abundantly able to preserve Achilles invulnerable to the shafts of the foe, until the hour should come when Fate decreed that he must die. Of brass and tin, silver and gold, Vulcan, the lame god, fashioned the shield, on which were embossed designs representing the constellations of the zodiac, a little town surrounded with pastoral scenes, and other characteristic embellishments, wrought with the most exquisite skill. When the greaves, breastplate, and helmet were completed, Thetis took them to her son, and advised him to become reconciled with Agamemnon ere he sought the field.</p> 
               <p>Shouting to the chieftains whose tents and ships he passed and summoning them to meet in council, Achilles repaired without delay to the tent of Agamemnon. Speedily the captains collected, curious and eager to learn the designs of Achilles, who now made overtures of peace. The King of Men, confessing that he had been wrong in his treatment of the hero, but artfully<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC5784-00000105"/> shielding himself from blame on the ground of having been led into error by the dark impulses of Fate and Discord, very gratefully met the advances of Achilles, and tendered all manner of costly presents as indemnity for the injustice he had done in the matter of Briseis, who was now restored to her lord with the most solemn oaths on the part of Agamemnon that he returned her to Achilles chaste and inviolate as when she was brought to his tent. These preliminaries settled, Achilles urged that the Greeks be immediately marched forth to battle; but Ulysses, who, if not as preminent in personal warfare as Achilles, was his superior in military foresight and prudence, wisely persuaded that impetuous chieftain, after much expostulation, to defer the forward movement until the men could have their morning meal, for they were utterly wearied in body if not in spirit by the constant and terrible fighting.</p> 
               <p>In the mean while Polydamas counseled Hector, wisely as the event proved, that as the appearance of Achilles at the head of the Greeks was now imminent, the Trojans should not attempt to abide the renewed onset of the foe, but should seek refuge behind the walls of Troy, where they could easily repel Achilles himself, at least until they could obtain some repose after<pb n=""/> their exhausting labors. But Hector, contrary to his customary prudence and foresight, rejected the proposal with scorn, rashly impelled to settle the fate of the war in the field. But he sent Paris, who had led on the right of the Trojan army, to hasten the arrival of Queen Penthesilea, who was within some days' march with a body of Amazonian allies for the Trojans, as Hector divined that the crisis approached when every force would be required. When Achilles had put on the magnificent armor brought him by Thetis, which shone like the sun at his rising in a clear sky, he mounted his chariot, which was drawn by the supernatural span of pied horses, Xanthus and Balius. But ere Automedon, their driver, gave the word for them to start, Xanthus, bending his neck until the long mane swept the ground, spoke words of strange and awful portent. Not by any fault of theirs, said the inspired courser, was it that Patroclus had been slain, but by Fate inexorable and inevitable. And Fate it was that from his mouth now decreed that Achilles himself must soon die, and descend to the shades below.</p> 
               <p>Unawed by the prodigy, nor turned from his purpose by the prediction, the dauntless chieftain placed himself in the van of the Greek host, and rushed to avenge his friend, to wrest victory<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC5784-00000106"/> from the grasp of Destiny and to meet his doom, heroic to the last. But when he fell upon the Trojan centre with an irresistible onset, their army was cloven in twain; and the right wing, pursued by Achilles, was driven into the Scamander, and thousands perished in the flood or by the swords of the enemy. The genii of the Scamander and the Simois, aroused to the aid of Troy by the corpses and the blood that filled and colored their streams, overflowed their banks with fury, and wellnigh destroyed Achilles himself in their foaming embrace. But he successfully avoided the extreme peril to which he was at one time exposed, and then attacked the remaining half of the Trojan army; but the Trojans, terror-stricken, and unheeding the frantic appeals of Hector, rushed into the city through the Scan Gate like a flock of sheep before a ravening wolf. Hector, who had protected the rear of his routed army, alone remained without the walls in his brazen chariot and, leaning on his spear, awaited the approach of Achilles, who claimed, of all the Greeks, the exclusive right of avenging on the Trojan general the death of Patroclus.</p> 
               <p>Two courses lay open for Hector to follow: one was to seek refuge for the time within the walls of Troy, there to attend the assault of the<pb n=""/> Greeks, and abide the arrival of his succors and a more favorable occasion for meeting the enemy in the open field; the other way was for him to accept the challenge of Achilles, and hazard the fate of Troy on the cast of a spear. Reason, every consideration, warned Hector to risk nothing, but rather to renter Troy at once, while he still had the opportunity of safely doing so; and, in addition to this, his aged father Priam and his mother Hecuba, now borne down by the weight of years and the loss of many sons, leaned over the battlements above him, and besought him in the most piteous accents, not to risk his own precious life and the existence of Troy and of all who were dear to him on the uncertain result of a personal conflict with the Greek champion, now fresh in the field and thirsting for revenge. Andromache was not there, but with her handmaids was preparing the bath for the return of her husband from battle. She knew not of the impending combat. It was a spectacle moving, beyond the power of language to describe, and Hector, nearly unmanned by the entreaties of his friends, their cries and lamentations and tears, had wellnigh followed their advice; but a high if mistaken sense of honor made him, on the other hand, shrink from any course of action that might appear as if he were<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC5784-00000107"/> impelled by fear rather than prudence to escape from the attack of Achilles.</p> 
               <p>Thus undecided in his mind, Achilles was upon him almost before he was aware. It was now, alas! too late to follow the counsels of prudence. Nothing was left to Hector but to fight. Then strange anguish seized the great soul of the hero. Before his fevered fancy suddenly appeared the horrors that were to befall his miserable friends and country after his death. Could he not avert a short time longer the combat on which such awful events depended? Would not his countrymen regain their courage and come to aid him in the slaughter of Achilles, if he but gave them time to reflect on the fateful nature of this crisis? Overtaken and mastered by these sudden thoughts, Hector turned the bay steeds that drew his chariot and fled. Achilles gave chase in his chariot. Long was the race over the plain, through gullies and on the edge of river banks, the foam flying in flakes from the horses' mouths and dappling their reeking sides, until pursuer and pursued reached again the open plain before the Scan Gate. But none had come to the rescue. The noble Hector was left alone to his fate. And here at last he made a stand, wheeled his team, and awaited in silence the inevitable combat. Since Troy had failed in<pb n=""/> her duty at this momentous hour, nothing was left but for him to do his own duty and acquit himself like a man. It was characteristic of the Mobility of his character that, as Achilles approached, Hector cried, "Let us, O Achilles, interchange oaths before we fight, by which we pledge ourselves, that if you fall I restore your body to the Greeks, but if I am slain, you allow my father to repossess my body and give it all needed funeral rites."</p> 
               <p>But Achilles fiercely responded, "I make no compact with such as you save the compact that lions make with hares, that wolves make with lambs; I make no compact except to throw your carcass to the vultures and the jackals, and here is the spear that clinches what I have said." So speaking, Achilles raised his spear, ten cubits in length, and hurled it at the head of Hector. But Hector, stooping as it shot by, was unharmed by the whizzing missile. Then he in turn raised himself in his chariot, one foot on the bench before him, and threw his own spear at the buckler of Achilles. Only, the celestial temper of the metal of which his shield was made saved Achilles from being pierced to the heart. Hector instantly drew his sword and rushed at his foe; but Achilles, it seems, was provided with an additional spear, of which circumstance Hector<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC5784-00000108"/> tor was unmindful, and as Hector bore down on him with his blade elevated to strike, Achilles through a joint in the armor gave him a thrust with the spear in the neck, bearing him violently out of the chariot and pinning him to the ground.</p> 
               <p>Then Hector gasped with speech made difficult by the gore that gurgled through his lips, "Listen to the prayer of a dying man, and let my father have my body to perform all needed funeral rites for my soul."</p> 
               <p>But Achilles roared, "Not all the prayers of Priam and his old wife, not all the wealth of the Troad, shall buy one funeral rite for you, who have sent so many Greeks to the shades of hell. But dogs shall devour your flesh and pick your bones!"</p> 
               <p>"Be it as you will; but know, O Achilles, that your day is at hand; and Paris, when he hears of my fate, shall send your soul to wander a melancholy ghost on the Stygian shore." Thus saying, the great Hector closed his eyes in death.</p> 
               <p>But while the corpse of his redoubtable enemy was yet warm, Achilles bored the ankles of his victim, and taking the hide reins from the horses of Hector, passed them through the bleeding wounds, and fastening them to his chariot, gave the lash to his steeds, and dragged the body before<pb n=""/> fore the walls of Troy, and after this disgraceful deed returned to the fleet. Then night came down and concealed in her friendly shades the Greek camp and the distracted, beleaguered town. Aye, there was sadness in Troy that night; few slept, and they who did dreamed dreams of fire and blood. The aged king and his wife, and Andromache, filled the air with their groans and agonizing shrieks.</p> 
               <p>Three days passed; they were days of quiet in the field, for Achilles was celebrating the funeral rites of Patroclus, for whom he raised a costly pyre, and instituted games in which the chiefs of the Greek army contended for the prizes. On the fourth day King Priam appeared at the door of Achilles' tent. It was a daring undertaking to venture thus into the power of such an implacable chieftain; and Queen Hecuba had done all that she could to dissuade Priam from his purpose of going to ask permission to carry away the body of Hector. But the old king remained firm, declaring that there must be some kindness and mercy left in the soul of the Greek, and that surely it was of Heaven that he had been prompted to go, and Heaven would protect his sacred mission. Priam then ordered mules to be harnessed to one of the royal chariots, and from the accumulated<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC5784-00000109"/> treasures which he had collected during a long reign in his coffers of cypress wood, selected twelve carpets woven by hand and gorgeous with variegated hues, and the same number each of veils, tunics, and vests, stiff with embroidery; to these were added two tripods, four chargers of gold, a golden bowl, and ten talents in gold ingots; altogether a very choice and noble collection of gifts, which were carefully deposited in the chariot, and then Priam, accompanied only by Idus, his aged herald, set out for the Greek camp. A kindly hearted youth whom they met on the plain guided the Trojan king through the hostile lines, and safely conducted him to the tent of Achilles.</p> 
               <p>The chief was at his meal when Priam entered, tottering with age and grief, and, stooping to the ground, clasped the knees of his redoubtable foe. With amazement Achilles gazed at the venerable monarch, whom sorrow had so humbled that he could abase himself, and from his life-long habit of commanding could now condescend to sue for a favor from his greatest enemy, and bathe those hands with tears which had so often been imbrued in the blood of his sons. In the most moving accents Priam appealed to all that was best in the nature of Achilles; he reminded him of his own aged father, Peleus, in Phthiotis, and besought<pb n=""/> sought him by the memory of that father whom he cherished so well to have mercy on his years and many sorrows and grant to his prayers the body of his son Hector. Although arrogant and cruel when enraged, Achilles was yet a man capable of tender emotions, and the speech of the old king touched his heart. Taking Priam by the hand he raised him up and led him to a seat, saying that his petition should be granted on the morrow. Then, overcome by a conflict of contending passions, and fearful least some evil impulse should move him to recall the promise which it had cost him so much to give, Achilles rushed forth from the tent to cool his brow with the low twilight wind, and soothe his agitation by the grand but melancholy music of the sea that in the still night watches rolled its white surges on the sand in the light of the rising moon, and chanted in the ear of the Greek warrior the littleness of man, his subservience to Fate, the transitory character of his own glory, and the vague vastness of that ocean of eternity on whose shores he knew that his soul must soon wander a solitary ghost.</p> 
               <p>By command of Achilles, handmaidens that night laved the corpse of Hector, which Apollo had tenderly preserved from decay, and anointed it with sweet-scented oil and laid it on a couch.<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC5784-00000110"/> On the following morning, while it was yet scarcely dawn, Priam took the body of his dead son in his chariot and with Idus quietly drove out of the Greek camp, as he had been advised by Achilles, lest if he lingered until the army awoke, the Greeks might refuse to allow him to return to Troy. As the slow-moving chariot came in sight of the city, multitudes poured through the Scan Gate, Hecuba and Andromache foremost among them, eager to see again the body of the beloved dead. So dense was the throng that the course of the mules was impeded, until Priam stood erect in the chariot and bade a passage be opened, saying that when the corpse reached the palace would be the time to pour out their tears over the remains of the departed. And thither they conducted the body of the great Hector, and laid him on a couch of state, around which the mourners stood and hymned plaintive elegies, in which were recited the deeds of the fallen hero, the immortal renown that should emblazon his name in after ages, and the miserable fate of Troy now bereft forever of her noblest son and strongest bulwark. Around the inanimate corpse stood Hecuba. and Andromache, his agonized mother and widowed wife, bending together over the marble brow, tenderly smoothing back the brown curls that clustered on the pallid temples<pb n=""/> ples, fervently kissing the purple lips that should never more utter words of heroism or of love, and moistening the hollow cheeks with hot tears. But little Astyanax, whom the nurse brought in her arms to see his dead father, called to him playfully and put out his tiny finger to touch him, but started back in amazement when he found that face so cold.</p> 
               <p>Helen was among those who most sorrowed over the corpse of Hector. She had been in a measure the cause of his death; had she never left Sparta, Hector would not have been lying now before her slain. And in him, too, she had lost the best friend she had in Troy, next to Paris; for, whatever might have been his private opinion of her conduct, and whatever he may have thought of the expediency of restoring her to Menelaus, he had never said aught to give her pain, and had fought bravely in defense of her cause. Often when he had heard the women of Troy reviling her, he had rebuked them. But now he was dead; and Paris she loved not as she had once loved, and she felt alone in the city which her misconduct had brought to the verge of ruin. Well might she weep and wring her hands in remorse and despair as she stood by the bier of Hector and lamented him with bitter, unaffected, but unavailing pathos and self-reproach.<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC5784-00000111"/> Alas! no tears, no repentance, now, could recall him from the dark, Plutonian realm to which his mighty soul had gone.</p> 
               <p>A truce of twelve days had been agreed upon between the two armies, for the purpose of performing the last funeral honors for the general of the Trojan host. For nine days wood-cutters, accompanied by teams of oxen and mules, proceeded to the gorges of Mount Ida and felled the largest trees of the forests and dragged them to the plain in front of the Scan Gate. There, on the spot where Hector and Paris contended for the prize many years before in their youth, a vast funeral pyre was erected, encircled around the outer edge of the platform with rows of jars containing honey and oil. Upon this pile the body of Hector was carefully laid, and on the morning of the tenth day all in Troy poured through the gates to witness the burning. But as Priam advanced to the foot of the pile to apply the torch, a murmur in the crowd arrested his attention. Looking about him, he saw Paris rapidly approaching. As Paris had been absent while the melancholy events related in the foregoing pages were occurring, he had only just become aware of the death of Hector; it was natural, therefore, that he should desire to see the corpse before it was consumed, and Priam accordingly tarried for him to reach the spot.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Saying not a word, Paris mounted the pile and, standing mute by the body of Hector, gazed fixedly upon him, overwhelmed by the mighty stroke of doom which had snatched from Troy her greatest safeguard, and from him his best and truest friend. Long he stood and looked with clasped hands, moaning, "My brother, my brother!" while the surrounding multitudes respected his sorrow and waited in silence till he should come down. But ere he descended, Paris opened his mouth and cried in a voice heard far over the plains: "Hear, ye assembled multitudes, ye Trojans who weep for Hector, and ye Greeks who crowd along yonder shore! bear witness to the oaths I take by the side of the corpse of the noblest hero that ever drew blade to fight for his country and for a brother's cause; yes, he fought and died for me, and by me shall he be avenged. By all the immortal gods who dwell in Olympus, by all the powers of the infernal shades, by all that is great and good, I swear that Achilles shall fall by my hand, by my efforts shall Achilles lick the dust!"</p> 
               <p>Then Paris descended, amid low murmurs of applause from many lips, and stood by the side of Priam, when the torch was applied to the pyre. Speedily the arrows of flame darted upwards and the pile was soon in a blaze. On the<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC5784-00000112"/> morning following the Trojans completed the funeral rites. The smouldering embers were quenched with wine poured plenteously over them, and the calcined bones, the last relics of Hector, were found amid the ashes, and carefully deposited in an urn of solid gold. Purple drapery was wrapped around the urn, which was then deposited on the ground and covered with a lofty mound of earth reared high in air, to perpetuate to after ages the fame of Hector. When all was over, slowly and sadly King Priam, with Hecuba and Andromache, led the sorrowing multitude back to Troy.</p>

               <head>XIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">HELEN, PARIS, none.</head> 
               <p>HECTOR was dead; and what would Troy now do without him? how could her armies now make head against the besiegers led by the irresistible Achilles? Stunned by the force of the calamity, and absorbed by their grief or by the deep and universal interest in the funeral ceremonies, the Trojans did not fully realize until the last rites for Hector were finished, that on the morrow hostilities would recommence, and that no efficient captain had yet been appointed to take his place. Polydamas and neas, two of the most prominent of the Trojan chieftains now surviving, suggested to Priam that it would be well, if he could for a while withdraw his thoughts from his sorrow, to summon a council of war at once in his pavilion to choose a leader for the army; for Achilles would be thundering at their gates by sunrise of the coming day.</p> 
               <p>But at this council it was too evident that these two captains each aspired to command the<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC5784-00000113"/> armies of Troy. Indeed, they took so little pains to conceal their jealousy and ambition that some high words were exchanged between them in the assembly. But the former was too cautious to suit the younger captains, and the latter, although of a courageous temper, had certain elements in his character which failed to obtain for him the respect which a commander should receive from his soldiers. A hot discussion followed, in, which King Priam took but little part, so overcome was his stricken soul by the calamities which had gathered, around him and his ill-fated house.</p> 
               <p>At last one of those present suggested Paris as a proper person to be chosen for this very responsible position. This pleased Priam, who, if he did not think Paris so great a captain as Hector, loved him, to the full as well; nor was it after all so bad a choice. During the battles of the last few weeks Paris had been rapidly maturing in character, and had rendered very efficient aid to the Trojan army. He had laid aside at least for a while, the indolence too often congenial to his sensuous nature; and the solemn purpose he had sworn to execute when gazing on the dead body of Hector showed that stern resolution now fired his soul, and that he had devoted himself as never before to great actions and<pb n=""/> noble deeds. There was, of course, a slight opposition made to this appointment by some, but not enough, since no other eligible candidate appeared, to dissuade Priam from investing his favorite son with the control of the military forces, admonishing him as he did so, to acquit himself like a man, and invoking the help of the gods for him and for Troy.</p> 
               <p>Immediately after receiving this authority, Paris, acting with decision and promptness, ordered the chieftains present to return to their posts, and prepare to make a sally on the Greeks before daybreak; he then sent a herald to Penthesilea, who with her army had just arrived in the vicinity and bivouacked on the road leading to the Dardan Gate, directing her to march around the eastern side of the city under cover of night, to be prepared to take the Greeks on their left flank, at the moment when he hurled his own army on their centre and right wing.</p> 
               <p>The main body of the Greek army under Achilles, was encamped on the advanced position which they had obtained during the last battle, within three or four furlongs of the Scan Gate. It was about the fourth watch of the night, at the time of changing the sentinels, the hour when the night was darkest; the moon had set not long before, and a white mist was rising a few feet<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC5784-00000114"/> over the plain, and still more effectually concealed whatever objects might be stirring. All was perfectly still except that from afar was heard the low thunder of the sullen, continuous beat of the restless sea on the shore. The cocks had just crowed when the Trojan army moved silently out of the Scan Gate and marched toward the Greek camp. But as they drew near, the guards detected the muffled rumble of the chariot wheels on the turf, the clank of spears and swords on the coats of mail, and soon after the peculiar sound that proceeds from the tramp of multitudes. At once the alarm rang along the hostile lines, and the Greeks sprang to their feet by thousands; above the tumult could be heard the terrible voice of Achilles calling to arms, like the roar of a lion of the desert.</p> 
               <p>The front ranks of the Greek host had prudently remained with their armor on, otherwise overwhelming and irretrievable ruin would have come upon them when the Trojan army was hurled against their front. As it was, the surprise was sufficient to give such force to the Trojan onset as to push the right wing of the Greeks back on the main body in confusion. There, however, the Trojans were met by Achilles in person, and checked by the terror of his invincible presence. Their cause was<pb n=""/> now very critical, for panic always followed where he showed himself; but at this juncture Queen Penthesilea with her army of Amazons fell on the left wing of the Greeks and drove it back in dismay. Immediately Achilles flew to the rescue, and after a desperate conflict with the royal heroine, pierced her to the heart, and stopped the further progress of her forces, who, being deprived of their leader, fled and were cut down with great slaughter. But while Achilles was thus absent defending his left wing, the Trojans plucked up courage again, and, led by Paris, wellnigh wrested victory from Diomedes, Ajax, and Ulysses, who commanded there. This turn of affairs recalled Achilles from the pursuit on the left.</p> 
               <p>By this time it was daybreak. The summer morning came on early, and the sun now arose above the Hellespont, the golden blaze glinting on the gore-dappled corselets and helmets of the combatants. Urging on his pied steeds with the lash, Achilles swept by Paris in hot pursuit of neas. He was clothed from head to foot in his matchless panoply; his feet alone were unprotected; they were shod with sandals of leather, bound around the ankle with thongs, and leaving the heel and instep exposed. Paris saw his opportunity as Achilles' back was turned to him, his left foot<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC5784-00000115"/> resting on the bench in the forward part of the car. Paris excelled as an archer, and it suddenly came to him that if he could only pierce the heel of his terrible enemy he could disable and might perhaps slay him. Selecting a broad, three-barbed arrow, without delay, Paris drew the bow-string to his ear and let fly. Sent with unerring aim, the fatal dart fixed itself in the bare heel of the Greek champion, and such was the width of the arrow-head that it clove the powerful tendon in twain which supported him in his position. Losing his balance and thrown back by the onward rush of the chariot, Achilles fell to the ground. It was the work of an instant, and before he could recover himself, or the Greeks could come to his aid, Paris was upon him and drove his rearing, snorting steeds and heavy chariot over the prostrate hero, severely disabling him; then wheeling and dashing at him again, Paris reined in suddenly, and, as Achilles strove to rise, hurled his spear through the very joint in the armor where Hector had been pierced, and pinned him by the neck to the ground. Instead of rushing to the rescue of their dying champion, the Greeks were so overcome by this sudden and entirely unexpected catastrophe, that they stood for a moment palsied with consternation and amazement. Before they<pb n=""/> could recover themselves, Paris had leaped from the chariot, bound a thong to the ankles of Achilles, who was still breathing but was insensible, and spouted blood and gore from his mouth; fastening the other end of the thong to the chariot, Paris lashed his horses, and dashed down between the two armies, amid a storm of darts hurled by the infuriated Greeks, and raining harmlessly on his ringing armor; he then wheeled to the left, and galloped in full career through the Scan Gate, dragging the mangled corpse of Troy's greatest enemy straight to the Pergamus and the palace of Priam.</p> 
               <p>Never did a people rise sooner from the lowest depths of despondency to the dizziest heights of exultation than did the Trojans now. The aged men tarrying at home, too old for war, the women and the children, thronged the street that led to the citadel, and pressed around the chariot of Paris to gaze astonished at their dread foe lying on the pavement, stiff, cold, and dead, the distorted features dashed with blood, and the glassy eyes staring horribly. Even while they saw him thus they trembled with awe when they thought of the terror which his name had inspired, and the calamities he had brought upon Troy. Then the people looked from the mangled corpse of Achilles to the manly person of<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC5784-00000116"/> Paris, and to his handsome face flushed with the fierce happiness of victory and revenge achieved, and a buzz of admiration and joy passed from one to another, and they forgot the sorrows he had caused, and the hate which sometimes they had borne towards him. Troy had found a worthy champion to take the place of Hector, they said, and who among the Greeks could withstand him who had slain Achilles. Troy once more was safe, they said.</p> 
               <p>And there on the steps of the citadel-palace stood King Priam, venerable and majestic, but with deep furrows, signs of much trouble, grooved into his features, which now were lit with a passing smile of fierce exultation, as through a rift in the storm-cloud a flash of the setting sun will illumine for a moment the lightning-riven sides of the scarred cliff with lurid gleams. Hector was now avenged, and all the other sons of Priam whom Achilles had slain; and what was not the least pleasing to Priam, vengeance had come by the hand of his favorite son Paris. Hecuba and her daughters and daughters-in-law, and her grandchildren, were also there, grouped around the aged monarch, gazing through blinding tears of joy on the corpse of the dead Achilles.</p> 
               <p>But as Paris glanced eagerly from one to another, the proud look gradually vanished from<pb n=""/> his face, and instead came a cloud of disappointment and perplexity. She whom he most loved, and whom he most desired to see there to share in his triumph, was absent. Helen remained aloof in that supreme moment of glory which the gods had permitted him to achieve. Surely she could not be ignorant at such a time of the great event which had just come to pass, and was known by this time to all in the city,-an event likely to have such a controlling influence on the destiny of her own future as well as for Troy. Could it be possible that she was indifferent to the success of the Trojan cause, which was also her own, as he considered; or, worse still, could she be indifferent to the honors and triumphs won by the hero who had plunged his country into war for her, and for her alone risked his life in a hundred battles? As these thoughts passed rapidly through his mind, a scowl shadowed his face, and apparently forgetful of all else, Paris left the corpse of Achilles to the charge of Priam, and strode away to his own halls, on the plea that he desired to refresh himself before returning to the field.</p> 
               <p>Helen was broidering at her tapestry as he entered, singing to herself the while in a tone low but full of suppressed energy; the tumult of thoughts which oppressed her found vent in<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC5784-00000117"/> a little song which she shaped to a simple air learned in years long past away:- <q>

               </p> 
               <p>As Paris entered the chamber, Helen ceased her singing, and, casting a glance at him, said, "I thought rightly that you would soon weary of the combat and return to solace yourself with love while your countrymen are fighting. Welcome, my hero; perchance you would like to exchange the spear for the distaff, or would wield a needle?"</p> 
               <p>To this bitterly ironical speech, uttered in a scathing tone, Paris was at a loss at first to make reply. Helen could hardly have thus made light of his manhood, he thought, if she had been aware of the success of the Trojan army under his leadership, and of the death of Achilles by the hand of him whom she now affected to despise; and although not altogether unaccustomed of late to receive taunts and harsh words from her, still nothing so apparently unprovoked and cruel had hitherto escaped her lips during her long intercourse with him. Conjecturing that something of which he was ignorant might have occurred to disturb her, and hoping that<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC5784-00000118"/> on being informed of his prowess, and the approach, as it now seemed, of the close of the war, her manner towards him would change, Paris controlled his indignation and disquietude to a degree, and replied to her sneers with all the calmness he could command: "No, my Helen, I have not come to lay aside my armor, as I may have done at other times when I ought to have kept it on. I have come but for a moment to kiss you before I join again in the battle from which I may never return. Can it be, my dear love, that you have not heard of the fall of Achilles, and how he fell? Surely you cannot have heard of this, or you would not have spoken so bitterly to one who loves you as I do."</p> 
               <p>"So Achilles has fallen! I heard something of the sort, and that you had slain him by a shot n the heel. So then it is true. I suppose it becomes me to feel proud of your valor and to rejoice in your success; but how is it possible? Was he not a Greek, whom you have slain, and am not I a Greek, too? and does not his death put further off my return to Greece and to my husband, Menelaus?"</p> 
               <p>"To Greece and your husband, Menelaus! What! do you hanker for them after so many years' absence, and after doing all in your power to make them hate you? Do you in very truth<pb n=""/> prefer them to me! Ah, has it come to this at last! Aye, aye, too true are the suspicions which have often of late arisen in my bosom, but which I have persistently thrust back, lest I should do injustice to one whom I love so well and whom I should be loth to injure or suspect, when she has voluntarily placed herself so entirely in my power."</p> 
               <p>"Talk not to me of love," cried Helen, in a tone in which the long agony of years at last obtained vent. "How can such a soft passion find lodging in a soul that is torn by the remorse that comes from seeing nations fighting and myriads slain because of love. It was in your power, as you very well know, a score of times to restore me to Menelaus, to bring peace again on the nations, and to avert the consequences of our crime from our heads. But you would not. And now I tell you that I love you no more; nay, I hate you, for had you never come to Sparta I never had known the awful faces of the Furies standing nightly at my bedside and mocking me with their horrible jeers. I hate you and yours, and I must, I will return to Menelaus; and think not that you can hinder me! If I have to betray you and Troy to reach my ends, yet will I return to Greece."</p> 
               <p>"Woman, never shall you return while I<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC5784-00000119"/> live! What prevents me from slaying you this instant with my own hand!" cried Paris, stepping towards Helen, trembling with the violence of his amazement and rage, and raising his arm as if to smite her to the floor.</p> 
               <p>Gazing at him with unflinching eye, she said, "Strike, if you dare. I am the daughter of a king, myself a queen." And with superb and terrific scorn she met his gaze undaunted, standing up at her full height and looking him directly in the eye without quailing.</p> 
               <p>"I knew you would not dare to harm Sparta's queen," Helen continued, as Paris slowly let his arm drop and staggered back as if in a swoon, and sat down and covered his face with his hands. One by one heavy drops fell from his eyes through his fingers, and deep sobs burst from his bosom; but he said not a word. Awful is the agony which wrings tears from the heart of the man whose eyelids are rarely moistened by grief. But Helen was merciless now; frenzy seemed to have taken possession of her soul, and, without respecting the anguish of Paris, she exclaimed: "It well becomes the slayer of Achilles to weep! Go back to your host, if you are the hero you assume to be, instead of playing the woman here away from the sound of battle! Go and die like a man! Better so than to live<pb n=""/> here wasting your manhood in criminal dalliance! Go! Would to the gods that I, too, could have such a chance as you have to make my life expire in glory!"</p> 
               <p>"You are right," replied Paris in broken tones. "I will no longer tarry here to be reviled by the woman on whom I have bestowed my heart, to see her at last fling it back to me when she is weary of it. You are right, I have no business to be dallying here at such a time. Ah, the gods have fearfully punished me, have fearfully punished us both for our crime,-if crime it be to love as we have loved, to love as I love you still, and shall love you till I die. none, none, at last thou art avenged for all the suffering which I caused thy poor heart! Now I know what thou hast endured, none, companion of my better years!"</p> 
               <p>Paris arose and walked to the door, but as he raised the curtain to pass out, stopped, hesitated a moment, and then said: "Helen, I forgive you for what you have done; it was not you that said it, but an evil demon that has possessed you. You will live to repent what you have said this day; you will live to regret, if you do not already, that ever you were born to curse two men's lives with your ill-fated beauty. Farewell! You will never see me again; farewell<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC5784-00000120"/> well!" He passed into the palace court and thence into the street. His royal parents were still there with the crowd collected around the body of Achilles, which was now stripped of its splendid armor, and was about to be carried into the citadel. As Paris reappeared all eyes were turned upon him, for he was now the hope and pride of Troy, to whom the Trojans looked for the salvation of their city. But hope fled from the hearts of the people when they saw him now. His countenance had changed. If a score of years had passed over him they could not have altered his features more than the half hour of his absence in the palace. Desperation and despair lurked in his blood-shot eyes; his jaw had lost its look of firmness and defiance, and the spear trembled in his nerveless grasp."</p> 
               <p>His mother, Hecuba, saw the change, and taking his hand fondly in hers, inquired anxiously, "Paris, my son, what hath befallen thee?"</p> 
               <p>But, with averted look, he replied, "Mother, hast thou known what it is to live too long? then thou knowest the trouble that hath befallen me." Pressing her hand, and, without trusting himself to utter more, Paris descended the stairway, mounted his chariot, and turning the horses' heads, drove slowly through the throng and disappeared from view in the direction of the Scan Gate.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"It is the Greek woman! She hath brought misery upon us all!" exclaimed Hecuba, divining with a mother's instinct the secret care that wracked the heart of her unhappy son.</p> 
               <p>During the absence of Paris, the battle had somewhat slackened in its fury, desultory skirmishing going on here and there along the lines. But, with his return the conflict recommenced, for, maddened to desperation, and courting death, he flung aside his buckler, and, spear in hand, drove into the thick of the enemy's ranks, calling on his men to follow. So sudden and irresistible was the Trojan onset that for a moment the Greeks were borne back. But soon, impelled by the taunts and cheers of Agamemnon, Ulysses, Ajax, and their other captains, they rallied and made a stand, crowding around the chariot of Paris, whose glittering helmet and horse-hair crest were conspicuous, as with unheard of prodigies of valor he dashed hither and thither, bearing down all resistance before him. But at last he was seen to fall, then rise again, and then the commanding form which on that day had performed such deeds of valor, disappeared entirely from the eyes of his anxious, troops.</p> 
               <p>"Trojans to the rescue!" cried his brother Deiphobus, waving his sword aloft and cutting<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC5784-00000121"/> a lane through the enemy, followed by the infuriated Trojans. They came up in season to save Paris from immediate death. Ajax Telamon had his spear poised to transfix the prostrate and wounded hero, when neas disabled the uplifted arm by a blow from a huge stone; and after a severe contest around Paris, the Trojans succeeded in bearing him from the field, in spite of the terrific efforts of the enemy to slay or capture him alive. The Greeks, disappointed because they had only succeeded in wounding the Trojan general, and disheartened by the irreparable loss of Achilles and the slaughter of the day's battle, now fell back to their camp, while the Trojans, satisfied by their partial victory, refrained from pursuing the retreating foe. This was the last great battle fought between the two armies in the open field, and at its close the state of affairs around Troy seemed on the whole in favor of the besieged; and if Paris had lived, from the ability and spirit he had exhibited on this day, there is good reason to believe that he would soon have forced the invaders to return to Greece foiled in the object of their expedition.</p> 
               <p>But Paris was now sorely wounded by a spear-thrust in the breast. When those who carried him had reached the rear of the army,<pb n=""/> and were about to bear him into the city, he ordered them to halt. Then, after drinking a little wine which one of the soldiers had at hand in a dry hollow gourd hung over the shoulder, and bathing his face with water from a brook that warbled its little song near by, as if unconscious of the strife of mortal men going on around its brink, Paris mustered strength to direct his men to bind eight spears crosswise, in the form of a litter. Over this frame was thrown a shaggy military cloak, and on this Paris was laid. He then directed the men to follow the road around the city until they came to the dry bed of a mountain torrent, near the Dardan Gate. This river bed they were to keep, as it led across the plain and up the gorges of Mount Ida, until they reached the spot where on the edge of a precipice a vast plane-tree overshadowed a small terrace, from under whose roots bubbled a spring which trickled through the turf, until it lost itself in a cascade. There they were to lay the litter and go in search of a small hut in the vicinity, where they would probably find a wood nymph named none. After giving these directions, Paris sank back on the litter exhausted. The bearers carefully lifted it on their shoulders and took up the line of march he had directed.</p> 
               <p>It was now high noon, and although one of<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC5784-00000122"/> the attendants shielded the head of the wounded warrior with a branch of laurel plucked from the wayside, yet the sun beat heavily on it, and the motion of the litter often forced a groan from his lips. As they moved up the mountain, hares and partridges were started from the underbrush, and once a brown bear rushed from the thicket across the path; but Paris, lover of the chase as he had been, now heeded them not. What must have been the thoughts that crowded through his mind during that hard, sad journey up the mountain. It was in remembrance of her request at their last interview that he now sought none, like one who, after surfeiting his soul with mere material self-indulgence and pleasure, is forced to turn at last for relief to the guidance of the pure spirit of his early years, whom he has forsaken, but who awaits the hour when he shall again turn to her to be strengthened and ennobled by her gracious influence for commencing another existence. Paris was aware that he was dangerously, if not fatally hurt, and that none possessed remedies which could heal when no others could. But would she be kind to him now, and cure the wounds of him who had so basely deserted her long ago, and treated her love so lightly when they last met? O, if she would<pb n=""/> only permit him to feel again the touch of her soft hand and restore him to health with her simples, they might be happy again together as in former years. With the approach of death his love for the Greek woman seemed to have lost its power over his mind; as the fire of his eyes grew dim, the spell with which her beauty had dazzled and bewitched his soul became feeble. Alas, that so often we see not what is for our best good nor what may prove our ruin, until it is too late to follow the one or avoid the other! alas, that the glance of the dying eye into the next world should also, when too late, reveal the mistakes, the crimes, which might have been left undone in this life!</p> 
               <p>The travellers rested during part of the night, resuming their weary journey on the following morning. It was towards evening when they reached the plane-tree on the plateau. At the foot of the patriarchal tree the soldiers laid the dying warrior, propping him against a smooth white stone which lay by the gurgling spring. Calm and peaceful was the hour, suggesting nothing less than sorrow and death. The setting sun was firing the highest peaks of the mountain ranges, and the valleys below were robed in purple gloom. The tinkle of sheep-bells and the bleat of lambs floated on the calm<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC5784-00000123"/> air in the distance, as the flocks proceeded to the folds. Already could be faintly heard at intervals the yelp of a jackal or a wolf venturing out from the caves far down in the ravines, or the hoot of the little owls that flitted mysteriously from crag to crag; and the soft air of the summer evening was fragrant with the perfume of the dewy thyme which grew on the slopes. To the dying eyes of Paris this tranquil scene vividly brought back the happy, innocent days of his youth before he knew that he was a king's son, while he yet contentedly tended his flocks and herds, and dwelt joyously with none.</p> 
               <p>After considerable search, the men who had gone in quest of none found her seated near her cot under the cliff, whither they had been directed by Paris. She was busy plaiting a small rustic basket out of fresh rushes. When the messengers accosted her, and inquired if she was the wood nymph none, for whom they were searching, she simply replied in the affirmative, but ventured not to question what might be their errand with her, because their military garb taught her instinctively that he whose return she had so long looked for in vain had at last come, and must be in need of her assistance, or he would not be there, as she knew but too well.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Paris, the son of Priam, is lying under the great plane-tree yonder, wounded, and commanded us to conduct you to him, if haply you might be able to assuage his pains," said one of the men to her in tones of respect.</p> 
               <p>But none looked not up from her task, nor made reply, but with lips quivering and hands trembling, plied her fingers more earnestly at the plaited work, yet in a mechanical method, for her swift-thronging thoughts were elsewhere. Heedless of the men standing and gazing at her, she struggled with herself in keen distress. With her lay the power to give new lease of life to him who had treated her love with such baseness. But was he not now showing fresh contempt towards her in returning and seeking her aid only when he sorely needed help and could not find it elsewhere? Was it not still, as ever before, more in selfishness, more for his own than for her welfare, that he had come? So she reasoned, although she had herself bade him apply to her when such an emergency should happen. But, then, did she not love him with all her soul, she said to herself on the other hand, and had she not waited and yearned for the coming of this very occasion, whose possibilities of happiness she was now hesitating to accept? Now that the possession of bliss seemed<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC5784-00000124"/> again in her power, should she reject it forever? Agonizing sighs escaped from her lips, her heart bled within her as she thus debated and pondered whether to leave him to his fate or fly to welcome him back to her arms and restore him to health. At length she partly arose and was about to accompany the men, apparently decided on the latter course, when doubt again overcame her. What if she should receive him with kindness and heal his wounds, what assurance had she from his past character that he would not forsake her again for the Greek queen; such was the natural apprehension that caused her again to hesitate.</p> 
               <p>But while none thus wavered and lingered, the precious moments were slipping away, and finally the man again said, "Fair nymph, if you would be of service to my master, delay not here, for he has but a short time to live, and may even now be dead, for aught we know."</p> 
               <p>This warning pierced her to the heart like a sharp arrow; could Paris be indeed thus dangerously wounded, while she so cruelly permitted him to suffer and perhaps die alone? O, not for worlds must such an alternative happen. Not if she could save him should he die, she cried, all her love returning like a great wave, and sweeping away all other emotions from her bosom.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Springing up in haste, and taking with her the basket of healing herbs, which she kept in her cot against the arrival of this hour, none hurried to the plane-tree where Paris was lying.</p> 
               <p>In the mean time Paris was anxiously awaiting for the coming of none with the simples which could alone avert speedy dissolution, for he was conscious that every moment he grew more and more feeble, and that his life-current was ebbing fast. And yet, while he longed he almost feared to meet her at this awful period, lest she should address him with too well merited reproach, and refuse to apply the only remedies which could avail. But when the evening star showed her argent gleam, a diamond in the golden setting of the western sky, and when the dews of twilight began to blend on his cold brow with the dew of death, the dying man heard the tread of steps approaching and strove to raise his head, but fell back gasping with the effort. But now he could faintly discern none close at hand, hastening with all speed to welcome her long-lost Paris home again, to heal his wounds, and have him for her own once more. Time and sorrow had not passed over her head without leaving their traces, but if she seemed less young she was not less lovely than in her earlier days; for every age has its peculiar beauty to those who rightly<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC5784-00000125"/> discern the growth of the soul. A deeper meaning now shone through her eyes, a more earnest expression imparted to her face a nobler grace than ever made it beautiful before, and the silver hairs interwoven with her auburn tresses told of a heart that had suffered much for the sake of him she loved.</p> 
               <p>When Paris, through the film that was gathering over his eyes, perceived none approaching him, he feebly exclaimed, "none! I have come back to you at last to die."</p> 
               <p>But she, quickly replying with a smile of ineffable joy, "O no, not to die, but to live with me many happy years, my darling," stooped to kiss his lips and forehead; but when she saw in the dim light how ghastly were his features, and felt how chill were his hands, she started in affright. Could it be that he was indeed so near gone? No, no, he must live, he must not die now; and she opened her little basket and hastily selected the balms that were to save his life. But on tearing off the clotted raiment which concealed his wound, to wash away the blood and apply the remedy, the flesh was so clammy, so lifeless, that with a shudder she placed her hand over the heart to see if it still gave sign of movement; but she felt no pulsation; it had ceased to beat. She gazed into his face; the features were set;<pb n=""/> the eyelids stirred not; he was dead. When at last the truth dawned on her agonized soul, a shrill cry of unutterable anguish clove the still air of night, and she fell in a swoon by his side.</p> 
               <p>The men who were present hastened to moisten her forehead with water from the spring, but it was long before none came to her senses again. When she at last revived, the soldiers, respecting her sorrow, and themselves overcome by the death of their leader and the toilsome march up the mountain, retired to a little distance, and, winding their watch-cloaks about them, slept. But all night long none sat by the corpse of Paris, bitterly reproaching herself because she had for a few moments delayed flying to his aid. If she had but heeded the summons without hesitation, he would now be still living, she said to herself; but he was dead, and with him had died her last hope of happiness and peace. In such wise they passed that night together,-the prince who had once been a shepherd of Mount Ida, and who now, after a life of wondrous vicissitudes, lay again amid the scenes of his innocent youth wrapt in slumber, but the slumber that knows no waking, and the gentle, pure-hearted wood nymph, who during all his absence and indifference had never wavered in the constancy of her love for him, and had now<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC5784-00000126"/> descended with him to the borders of that other world which every soul must enter alone. And over them the slow stars rolled one by one, and the constellations that change not while mortal men live their little lives, and die and are forgotten; and around them silently crept the pallid mist from the ravines below, and concealed the desolate nymph and her dead lover in its ghostly folds.</p> 
               <p>But when the morrow began to dawn, in pursuance of the command of Paris, in the event of` his death, the soldiers gathered such dry branches and fallen trunks as they found in the neighboring forests, and erected a hasty funeral pile under the plane-tree. Thereon they laid the corpse, after carefully bathing it. none had watched these preparations in silence, with haggard countenance and parched eyes. But after the torch was applied to the wood, and the flames began to writhe around the pile, she stepped quickly towards the pyre, and mounting it before the men could divine and frustrate her design, embraced the corpse of him to whom she had given all the affection of her soul, and perished.</p>

               <head type="sub">ULYSSES.</head> 
               <p>THE news had speedily been brought from the field of battle informing Priam and Helen and all Troy that Paris had been sorely wounded, and had been carried at his desire to Mount Ida. Then suspense weighed down the hearts of the Trojans, until on the fourth day at evening the soldiers who had accompanied him returned with the tidings that Paris and none had died together on the mountain. Great was the lamentation made for Paris. Priam, his aged father, who had doted upon him, refused to be comforted; and the noble traits which Paris had displayed in the closing days of his life had endeared him to the Trojans, and even many of those who had once with justice most bitterly hated and opposed him, had been dazzled by the radiance of his last hours, and with the fickleness natural to the popular mind, now joined in the general mourning. In the grief of the occasion all seemed to forget that while Paris had achieved some brave<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC5784-00000127"/> exploits for his own renown and the glory of Troy, he had on the other hand been the means destined by Fate to bring on his native country woes unutterable, whose calamitous influence would not cease with his death but would continue their baleful effects long after he who originated them had passed to the nether world, to receive judgment from Rhadamanthus according to his deeds. It is the direst curse attendant on evil action that the doer cannot always at his will confine the resultant mischief to himself alone, nor always limit it to the period of his own brief career on earth.</p> 
               <p>When the tidings first came that Paris was wounded, Helen, whose fortunes had been so interlinked with his, experienced some temporary compunction for the poignant anguish she had caused him at their last interview; and she now hoped that by tending and healing his hurts she might make amends to him whom she had once loved with all-absorbing passion and tenderness, although not so blind as to be unconscious that such love as she had once bestowed upon him could never warm her bosom again, for the fire of love, once expired, can never be rekindled. But when she heard soon after, that instead of seeking rest in her arms as on former occasions, Paris had gone for solace to Mount Ida, to<pb n=""/> none, his former companion, then jealousy aroused in her emotions more violent than those of love. And when Helen learned still later of his death, stern exultation filled her soul. Paris was dead; by no act of hers was it, so she said to herself-but he was dead. Now, surely, there could be no opposition made to her restoration to Menelaus, and now at last she could leave this hated Troy, and return to the land of her birth and to her daughter Hermione. But while her conclusion that this would be the result of the death of Paris, whose will had hitherto swayed the counsels of Priam and the kingdom, was perfectly natural and reasonable, Helen found to her amazement that she had judged too hastily; for when, some days after these events, supposing that King Priam had sufficiently recovered from his grief to listen to her petition, she craved an audience, and asked his permission to be restored to Menelaus, adding that thus also would the Troad be rid of the invading host, Priam answered her in a husky voice, tremulous with senile wrath. It should be considered as an explanation of the conduct of the old king, that whatever Hecuba might have suspected, woman and mother as she was, and ever jealous of the Greek viper, as she sometimes called her, Priam, being less acute in tracing the workings of the female heart, and<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC5784-00000128"/> like many easy natured men of his years, credulous and totally unsuspicious of the integrity of those whom he liked, supposed that Helen loved Paris to the day of his death, and for his sake would always prefer to abide with his kindred to returning to the Greeks. This partly accounts for the temper which Priam now displayed, for nothing can be much more exasperating than the first discovery of the unworthiness of one who has been the object of trust, protection, or generous affection.</p> 
               <p>"Paris is scarcely yet dead, and you wish to leave us so soon! Surely fickle is the heart of woman! You could not have loved him truly, who, whether right or wrong, compassed so many seas and fought so many years for love of you, if so speedily after his death you desire consolation in the arms of the man whom you deserted, fifteen years ago. Ah, this is a strange world, where we die and straightway are forgotten. But if you have forgotten Paris, I have not forgotten that by you, whom I have so tenderly nurtured in my palace as my own daughter, came war on my dominions and death to Paris, the son of my old age. This your request cannot be. If you so much wish to leave Troy, let the Greeks first cease to wage war upon us; what right have they to harry my lands and slay my sons and<pb n=""/> people, because, forsooth, a woman with a fair face chose to follow my son hither! It was none of my affair whether you chose to dwell among us or not until all Greece gathered here on my territory to force me into sending unfaithful wives back to their husbands. But now matters have gone too far for me to allow you to return, unless the invaders first quit my shores. The day after their fleets have sailed away you shall be free to go whither you will-you who have been the means of such woes on my kingdom; but until then be content to tarry within our walls, and you shall be unmolested and shall continue in all respects to be treated as my daughter-in-law; but beware how you seek to fly from the city, for my guards shall have strict orders to slay you if caught making the attempt! Go in peace!"</p> 
               <p>It happened that, on the day following this interview, Agamemnon sent a herald to the Scan Gate to propose that since Paris was dead, who had thus far been the great obstacle to the restoration of Helen, she should now be sent back to Menelaus. Helenus, the priest and the son of Priam, strongly advised compliance with this request, urging, in opposition to Deiphobus, his brother, who now commanded the garrison and desired the hand of Helen, that although Achilles was slain, Ulysses, Diomedes, Agamemnon, and<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC5784-00000129"/> many other redoubtable chiefs still directed the enemy's host, and were not yet prepared to relinquish the siege, and they might yet succeed. Cassandra, the sister of Helenus, inspired by the gods, also foretold with flaming eyes and streaming hair and foaming lips the speedy downfall of Troy; but as was her fate, her prophetic counsels were never heeded although ever fulfilled. Much to the astonishment and indignation both of the Greeks and the Trojans, Priam sent back the stern message that not until the last Greek had left the Troad would Helen be permitted to leave Troy; and that any further negotiations, except on that basis, would be utterly rejected. Evidently the old monarch had some spirit left, and meant to show that neither he nor Troy had yet reached the last gasp.</p> 
               <p>By the same herald the Greeks asked permission to carry away the body of Achilles. To this, after some demur, Priam consented, on condition that the costly ransom of stuffs and articles of gold which he had paid for the body of Hector should be restored. The Greeks agreeing to this, they were permitted to carry off the corpse of Achilles, to which they accorded imposing funeral rites; and erected over the golden urn containing his ashes a lofty mound, by the sea-side on the Sigean Point.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Both parties had been so exhausted by the recent battles and the loss of their ablest champions and leaders, that active hostilities ceased for a while by the tacit consent of all, the Greeks contenting themselves with blockading the roads to the city, and foraging in the harvest fields of Mysia for provisions against the coming winter, while the Trojans lay quiet within their walls and kept their fortifications well guarded against surprise. Nor was winter long in coming. It arrived earlier than usual that year, so that by the middle of November the ridges of Mount Ida were already whitened with the fall of snow which robes them until spring, and the winds began to sweep with a shrill wail over the sere, bleak plains, accompanied by an occasional flurry of hail and snow. As drear December came on apace, the lank wolves descended from the mountains, howling under the walls of Troy, and prowling around the Greek camp, sometimes, in their ravenous hunger coming in flocks and attacking and devouring the guards who at night happened to fall asleep at their posts. And there was sadness in Troy,-for the old and stricken king and his royal family, and for the lorn widows and their starveling children, who tried to eke out a scanty subsistence from meagre stores of corn, barley, or lupines, which they<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC5784-00000130"/> ground in the hand-mills, or from dry carobs, which the wild boars eat in the woods, while they crouched for warmth over pans of charcoal, or, wrapped in fur gowns now worn thin, longed for the spring to return, and yet dreaded it for the fresh calamities it might bring. Nor did Agamemnon and his army feel greatly elated by their present condition; for terrible had been their losses, and much they feared that Troy would yet hold out many weary months, and that but a feeble remnant of them would survive to return to Greece.</p> 
               <p>But one there was in the Greek camp who, although never over-confident nor exultant in time of success, was, on the other hand, not greatly depressed in time of adversity; shrewd, crafty, prudent, brave, although never rash, comparatively young in years, but old in wisdom, was Ulysses the son of Laertes. Now, while his comrades in arms were passing the winter months in sleep or in idle games, or in childishly lamenting their distant homes, he not a whit less anxious than they to return to his wife Penelope and to his island realm, but resolved that the siege should not be abandoned until Troy had fallen, was busy devising a scheme for the capture of the city. An unexpected incident occurred about this time which Ulysses turned to good account<pb n=""/> count in the deliberations which now occupied his thoughts. Helenus the hierarch of Troy was captured on his way to offer sacrifices at a temple of Ceres, which was without the walls in the direction of the mountains. His sacred office and the relaxed vigilance of the Greeks, led him to suppose that he could reach the temple and return without molestation; but it happened, most unfortunately for him and for Troy, that he was met on the way by a troop of Greek warriors returning from the sack of a small town and flushed with wine and success. They seized the Trojan priest, and handling him with roughness, entirely heedless of his expostulations, bore him off to the Greek camp. The capture of so important a personage as the son of Priam and the leading priest of Troy, was hailed as an auspicious omen by the King of Men, and good care was therefore taken that Helenus, although courteously treated, did not escape from the ship of Ulysses, in whose charge he was placed. Ulysses was not long in finding out from his captive that he had been in favor of the restoration of Helen when the question was recently debated, and what was still more important, the Ithacan learned that the prolonged safety of Troy was due to the Palladium, or effigy of Pallas, who, as the tutelar divinity of<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC5784-00000131"/> cities, had bestowed this talisman on the Trojans, to preserve their city secure from all enemies so long as it remained in their possession. Helenus further stated, that after the siege had commenced the Trojans, in order to render its capture next to impossible, had caused a number of statues to to be made exactly resembling the original image, and placed one in each of the temples of the city, the temple in which the true Palladium was kept being known only to a very few. But if Helenus, in a moment of unguarded weakness, had confided thus much to Ulysses, his wily enemy, neither threats nor promises could extort from him the name of the particular temple which sheltered the inestimable Palladium.</p> 
               <p>But the information he could not draw from Helenus Ulysses considered that he might obtain from Helen; now that Paris was dead, he judged that she would be desirous of returning to Greece and to her husband Menelaus, if assurances of kind treatment and oblivion of the past were conveyed to her; and he also surmised that for the sake of this she might be willing to assist in the betrayal of the place if opportunity were offered her of doing so, since, after the refusal of Priam to restore her, her freedom had become contingent on the fall of Troy. Nor was Ulysses wrong in his opinion of Helen's present sentiments<pb n=""/> ments, for her proud spirit could little brook the forced authority of Priam, and the anger aroused by his refusal had prepared her for any alternative. Bringing his profound knowledge of human nature to his aid, Ulysses finally devised a complicated plan of operations, and secretly divulged his scheme to Agamemnon, and the other chiefs. After obtaining their consent to its execution, he stole quietly out of the camp on a dark night, clothed in squalid, beggarly raiment, and bearing raw, self-inflicted bruises on his back and shoulders. Early on the following morning he appeared at the Scan Gate and besought admittance into the town, on the plea that he was a slave who had been maltreated by his Greek master and had fled for refuge to the enemy. The captain of the guard set over the gate, without bestowing any thought on the matter, and taking the man's story as true, judging from his miserable exterior, ordered a small door which was in the larger gate to be opened. Ulysses entered, and was only too glad that the gruff sentinel grumbled at him "for a vagabond churl, bothering honest folk with his bawling," as it gave him the opportunity of escaping any troublesome inquiries, by immediately wandering off into the by-lanes of the city; there, beggar-like, he idled away the day, lying in the<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC5784-00000132"/> sunny, sheltered corners to obtain warmth, and gnawing a dry crust which a Trojan dame had flung to him.</p> 
               <p>But when night came on Ulysses made his way to the citadel hill, and slept at the foot of the steps leading up to the palace. When the sun was risen, Helen, accompanied by a slave girl, was seen descending from the citadel to visit the temple of Aphrodite, at the hour of morning sacrifice. When she saw Ulysses lying there she gave a slight start, as if in his face she descried a familiar look. She closely scanned the features of the stranger; but he was so disguised and withal changed by the years that had passed since she last saw him, that she could not at once define the vague memories it recalled; so she passed on, baffled. But while walking to the temple her mind was curiously busy endeavoring to unravel the confused train of thought suggested, and recall where she had seen that face before. While in the midst of her devotions, like a flash it came upon her that this seeming pauper must be Ulysses. Eager to ascertain the fact, and intuitively confident that it must be her he desired to see in venturing into the hostile town, she hurried back to the palace. Ulysses was still there, near the steps, apparently, with a vacant countenance, striving to keep warm in his<pb n=""/> rags in the pale sunlight, and waiting for some slave to notice and ask him to enter and sit by the hearth. But he was, notwithstanding, wide awake and on the alert, and when he saw Helen approaching him again, with rapid step, he discerned in her face that she had divined his secret, and lest she should imprudently address him then and there, placed his finger carelessly over his mouth as she eagerly gazed at him, thereby enjoining silence.</p> 
               <p>"Poor man! how cold and hungry he looks," said Helen to her attendant. "He must have lain out here all night. Girl, see that he has some food taken to him, and to-night let him have shelter in my servants' hall. Methinks there is suffering enough in Troy, without poor wretches being forced to sleep in the streets this nipping weather."</p> 
               <p>Soon after a slave brought him a dish of hot lentil broth and a morsel of unleavened wheaten: cake, bidding him at the same time come in and lie on a skin in the kitchen after the sun had gone down. Thus, on the following night, Ulysses slept under shelter until after the second watch. But when all was quiet, and no sounds were heard except, borne on the wind from beyond the walls, the faint bark of shepherd dogs defending the folds, a maid stole softly down, and,<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC5784-00000133"/> touching Ulysses on the shoulder, bade him follow her. She led him to the apartment of Helen. Then It was moving to see with what pathetic welcome Helen greeted her countryman in her own native dialect, and herself offered him wine in a golden goblet. After this she bade the damsel fetch water in a ewer and lave his hands and feet over a silver basin. These preliminaries over, Helen invited Ulysses to occupy a throne wrought of carved ivory which had been the favorite seat of Paris in his happy days. The gleam of the olive-fed wick burning in the bronze link pendent from the ceiling by chains, while scarce brilliant enough to light up the dusky corners of the armor-hung hall, was so placed that the radiance fell full on the forehead of Helen, throwing her eyebrows into deep shade, which caused her luminous eyes to flash more intensely, and chiseled out the lines of her white neck and shoulders in strong relief against the shadows behind. Ulysses, as he contemplated her, thought that the touch of time had lain but lightly on that queenly brow; if many years had passed since the famous assemblage of suitors at Sparta, when he had acted such an important part, she certainly looked none the less beautiful now than then; more matronly perhaps, but therefore more stately and magnificent. But as he had<pb n=""/> not ventured his life, within the precincts of Priam's citadel to waste the precious moments in the admiration of beauty, or in hearkening to the brilliant and earnest language of Helen, who was plying him with rapid inquiries about her husband and her countrymen, Ulysses interrupted his hostess to ask in an undertone whether she reposed confidence in the slave attendant who was present. Helen replied that the girl had been promised her freedom if trustworthy in aiding whatever plans might be confided to her knowledge, and had on various occasions already shown herself faithful to her mistress.</p> 
               <p>Ulysses now informed Helen that it was under consideration to surprise the city, and for this purpose it was above all needful first to learn in which temple the true Palladium was concealed. The secret had been confided to Helen by Paris, and without hesitation she informed Ulysses in what quarter of Troy it could be found. But when he heard that it was watched by a sacred band sworn to perish in its defense, Ulysses perceived that he would require others to assist in the undertaking, and to this end it became important to ascertain the height of the walls of Troy. It was planned that on the following morning Helen or the maid should saunter forth and ascend the walls by the Scan Gate, as if to<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC5784-00000134"/> take the morning air and view the Greek camp. She was then so to contrive as to drop her spindle to the ground, after the fashion of women spinning when abroad; but while she was appearing to wind up the thread, she would contrive to snap it in two level with the top of the wall as if it had been done with a violent jerk; when Ulysses, being already there, carelessly lying in the sun, would step forward to pick up the spindle for her, and before restoring it to her, would break off the yarn where it reached the ground, secreting the segment of thread, and thus, apparently in the most accidental manner, obtaining the exact height of the wall.</p> 
               <p>After this plan had been arranged, Helen confided to Ulysses that Priam, without her consent, intended to bestow her on Deiphobus, a brother of Paris, and the marriage was to be solemnized within a month, on a day already set; also, that Deiphobus, being now commander of the Trojan garrison, if the Greeks could succeed in surprising the city during the wedding festivities, when the Trojans were filled with wine, and slay Deiphobus, the place would fall without a blow. But Ulysses told her that while he and his comrades would be prepared for any contingency, it was hardly probable that more would be first attempted than the capture of the Palladim, and<pb n=""/> that if that enterprise succeeded, the fall of the city being thus insured by the Fates, the final surprise and overthrow of Troy would be brought about in a way entirely novel and less bloody to the invaders, and her coperation in the death of Deiphobus and the fall of the place might then be expected. After this interview, Ulysses returned to the kitchen, whence he was ejected by the servants on the following morning, and indolently made his way to the vicinity of the Scan Gate. In due season Helen's maid appeared spinning as she walked, and, mounting the wall, gossiped for a while with one of the guards; she then approached the inner parapet and let the spindle drop to the ground, apparently by accident. All happened as had been concerted, and the damsel returned to the palace. After nightfall Ulysses, by a cord which he had brought from the camp wound next to the skin, and which he fastened by a slip noose to one of the battlements, let himself down from the walls and escaped, taking good heed, however, to draw the rope after him, so as to arouse no suspicion.</p>

               <head>XV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE PALLADIUM.</head> 
               <p>IT was indeed as Helen had said. Not satisfied with forcing her to remain in Troy, Priam now added to the misfortunes of this erring but unhappy woman, what was to her the dismal fate of being given for wife to Deiphobus the brother of Paris; although to Priam and Deiphobus it seemed that they conferred on her new honor by permitting her to enter this relation with all the hollow pomp of royal nuptials. It was in vain that Helen earnestly, although inconsistently, protested against the wrong thus done to her and the emptiness of the mere form of marriage, on the ground that she had another husband living whom she vastly preferred, alleging also the indecency of such a hasty consummation before she had been able to mourn the proper time for Paris. But her expostulations were of no effect, for Priam considered it an act of sound policy to bind Helen by new ties to his family, to show Menelaus and the Greeks how useless<pb n=""/> it was for them to think of ever accomplishing the end for which they had come to Troy; while Deiphobus was too blinded by the vehemence of passion to heed opposition or care whether Helen reciprocated his desires or turned from his alliance with aversion. And so, in spite of herself, the inevitable day for the marriage rite arrived, and Helen became the so-called bride of a man whom she regarded with hate as now her worst foe, whatever she might have thought of him under different circumstances.</p> 
               <p>The violence of her emotions was such that Helen was strongly tempted to stab Deiphobus to the heart when, after the revelry of the wedding festivities, he sought her couch, boisterous with much wine. But the desperation of the deed, which would have only hastened her own destruction, the deep yearning of her soul for a more terrible revenge that should involve Priam and all his family in one common ruin, and the determination to live to return to her kingdom, enabled her so far to control herself as to submit passively to the embraces of Deiphobus.</p> 
               <p>This marriage gave occasion for rejoicing to all who were immured within the walls of the beleaguered town. Days of blithesome wassail had been for long so scarce, that young and old now resigned themselves to the ill-timed hilarity<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC5784-00000136"/> of the hour. The war-worn veterans of the garrison no less than the citizens indulged in clamorous orgies, and by the time their general was locked in the arms of Helen in a heavy sleep, the whole city, including the guards at the gates and on the walls, had drunk themselves leaden-eyed, and lay sprawled in profound, unwholesome, and perilous slumbers. By the third watch of the night it is safe to say that there was not a warrior in Troy who was not a dullard, felled to the earth nerveless and witless by the sleepy potions of treacherous Bacchus. But Ulysses and Diomedes were not asleep. Now or never was their time to seize the priceless Palladium. Towards midnight-and a very dark night it was-they stole out of the camp with a chosen band of chieftains. Proceeding with cautious step, the warriors reached the vicinity of Troy, where they lay shivering and encrusted with frost in the marsh-meadows, waiting for perfect quiet to reign on the ramparts. Ulysses here displayed a characteristic specimen of his ever wakeful craftiness and ingenuity. Menelaus had inadvertently left his tent without a watch-cloak, and was now in consequence almost perishing with the cold. In this emergency he appealed to Ulysses for the use of part of his cloak. But Ulysses instead<pb n=""/> of this whispered to Menelaus, "I will procure one for you;" then in a louder tone he said, "My friends, I have just dreamed that we shall need reinforcements; rise, one of you, and hasten to bid Agamemnon send up more men." On hearing this, Thoas, an ardent young warrior, started up and hurried back to the camp, for the greater speed leaving his cloak behind him. At once Menelaus seized upon it and rolled himself up in its comfortable folds.</p> 
               <p>About an hour after midnight all seemed quiet in Troy, and softly arising, the Greeks who were lying in wait approached the walls, planted against them a scaling ladder of a length measured by the yarn, and silently mounted to the parapet. Menelaus was the first up; a drunken guard was snoring in an angle of the nearest tower; with a thrust of a broadsword Menelaus slew him before he could utter a cry. Ulysses, who was familiar with the way to the steps that led below into the city, dropped quietly down like a cat, followed by his comrades, and threading the dark and winding streets, finally reached the temple where the Palladium was kept, undiscovered. All were asleep in and around the fane at this critical hour, except a huge hound, who snuffed the hostile troop as they came into the open space in front of the building.<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC5784-00000137"/> With a low, furious growl, like the rumble of distant thunder, the trusty animal started up and prepared to spring; but he was seen in season, a spectral-like shape in the dusky shade, and before the faithful guardian of Troy could fly at the enemy and arouse the sleeping city with the alarm of his deep baying, Diomedes threw a cloak over his head and buried a blade in his heart.</p> 
               <p>The keepers of the temple were successfully surprised and slain, and the Palladium was found, as Helen had stated, in the cella of the temple. After seizing the Palladium, the adventurers held a hasty consultation as to whether they were in sufficient force to attempt either the citadel or the slaughter of the guards at the Scan Gate, possession of which would enable them to give entrance to the whole Greek army. Menelaus, who burned with rage and jealousy against Deiphobus, and with new kindled love for his lost queen, and to whose ardor it seemed a light thing to surprise the citadel, was now for moving directly thither, confident that Helen would be on the watch to render assistance. Nor was he mistaken in this, for when she saw Deiphobus lying as if dead in his first sleep, she softly crept from his side and mounting to the flat roof, listened intently for any unwonted<pb n=""/> sounds, prepared, if needs be, to unbar the postern of the citadel and admit the invaders.</p> 
               <p>But the wishes of Menelaus were overruled by the prudent counsel of Ulysses, who argued that it was of vital importance to convey the Palladium out of the city, which being safely accomplished, the fall of Troy became a certainty with the next attempt; he also urged that day was already beginning to break in the east, and they would be very soon discovered, and their return to the camp with the Palladium would then be rendered arduous if not impossible. In obedience to this advice, they quickly remounted the walls and escaped with their ladder, reaching the camp without having lost a life, and bringing with them the Palladium.</p> 
               <p>But when the Trojans awoke from their debauch and found what an overwhelming calamity had befallen them in their sleep, it was fearful to see the gloom and consternation which came upon all. The guards slain in the heart of the city, and Troy rifled of its bulwark of self-defense, was an event, whether wrought by the gods or by their instruments the Greeks, that boded the wrath of the eternal powers who preside over the fates of men, and foretold the inevitable downfall of proud and mighty Troy. At the tidings, women with child were so overcome<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC5784-00000138"/> that they miscarried and died in their pains; and there were not wanting old men who were struck lifeless by the sudden sorrow and terror produced by this appalling stroke of doom. Priam, surrounded by his surviving sons and chiefs, who had hastened to communicate the dreadful news and consult with him on this fateful occasion, raised his palsy-stricken hands to heaven, and while his white beard quivered with the violence of his emotions, said, "Cursed be the day of my birth, and the hour when Paris was begotten to be a firebrand to consume his native city; and yet, O ye gods, perchance he was but the victim of Fate, as we all of us are; cruel Fate, who would punish us for the sins of our fathers, for surely we are not worse than other men of our generation, that we should be selected to suffer in this life above others our fellows,-we who live but for a little, and then hasten to the horrors and the mystery and the silence of the nether glooms!"</p> 
               <p>Helen alone exulted at this juncture, of all who dwelt in Troy, for now she saw the approaching termination of her exile, and retribution coming upon those who shackled her freedom and hindered the return to her family and kingdom. And great was the rejoicing of the Greeks. What if the city had not yet fallen; was not its<pb n=""/> capture as certain now as the rising of the sun, and was not the glorious anticipation a fit return for all their hardships and perils for ten years? The unthinking many reck little of the past; thought spent upon it is to them vacuous and unprofitable; but give them the promise of a merry to-morrow, and they are like children amused with baubles, or striving to seize the illusive bow of Iris in the weeping skies, seemingly at hand, but ever beyond reach and impalpable.</p> 
               <p>The Greeks, under the superintendence of Epeus, a skillful craftsman, now hastened the completion of a vast horse which was to be employed as the final stratagem in the reduction of Troy. Care was taken that its height should exceed the measure of the thread brought by Ulysses, so that the horse should overtop the walls. The ribs of the body were shaped from solid oak, and planked over as one might plank a ship's frame; within were room and seats for a score or two of men, and in the back or uppermost side was a scuttle for entrance to the interior. The proportions of this wooden monster were well preserved throughout, and when finished its head towered high in air and overlooked the whole camp. Ulysses, Machaon, Menelaus, and a band of chosen chieftains, ready for, and equal to a desperate enterprise, now<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC5784-00000139"/> mounted the horse by a ladder, and, after they had entered in, with a store of provisions, the scuttle was skillfully closed by a tight fitting slide, so that no seams should attract suspicion. Care had been taken to leave apertures for fresh air and light in the nostrils, ears, and joints.</p> 
               <p>In the mean time, the Greeks had also prepared their galleys to put to sea. Of the thousand keels which had composed the fleet when it first reached Troy, scarce a third now remained seaworthy. Some had been burned by the Trojans in their assault on the Greek lines, many had been ruined by exposure to the blistering sun on the white beach through ten long summers, and some had been broken up to furnish fire-wood during the bleak winters, for, as the invading army had also been reduced rather more than half by the horrors of the siege, fewer vessels were needed to transport the remainder to Greece. The galleys that were still in condition were now caulked and pitched and provisioned with supplies for consumption during an absence of a few days.</p> 
               <p>The sun was now in Aquarius; the days were short and churlish in their aspect; but the nights were long and consequently favorable to the designs of the invaders. The unpropitious weather which had prevailed till now, seemed, however,<pb n=""/> about to give place for a while to milder airs, and the pilots, with the change of the moon, foretold fair skies and tranquil seas; word was therefore passed through the fleet that the crews man their respective galleys and launch away. Gladly the mariners and warriors gave themselves to the task, lightening their toil with song, for they foresaw the speedy termination of their labors. Crunching down the sand, now slowly and anon with a sudden start, galley after galley slid into the water; the masts were stepped, and then, as there was no breeze, the rowers bent to the sweeps. It was towards sunset before the last vessel of the fleet was afloat. The armament with measured stroke glided towards the isle of Tenedos, under the lee of which they were to moor and await the course of events. But as they went they saw the low sun setting before them with unwonted splendor. Couchant on a bank of purple cloud low down in the offing, the dazzling orb burnished the gently heaving hyaline surface of the deep with a wavering reflection of pure gold. But in the vault above the clouds were scattered in fantastic groups, scarcely stirred by the light zephyrs, and presenting every variety of brilliant tints; now leaden colored masses rolling over in exuberance of form and showing an overflow of gleaming<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC5784-00000140"/> white like the overboiling foam of a breaking wave, or towering like the peaks of snow-capped mountains aflame with the roseate kiss of the sun, or again flecking a space of vivid blue with a flight of silvery cloudlets like a flock of passage birds, or lying near the horizon in long tender lines of ineffable glory. Gradually and almost imperceptibly the vapory pageant seemed to converge more together and nearer to the sun, and assume the definite appearance of a hilly elevation on which stood aerial walls and towers and temples, seemingly ablaze with the ruddy tints of a conflagration, whose awful brightness was reflected far up into the zenith, until suddenly the sun disappeared and the celestial pageant faded into ashen hues and dark night came down on the sea. Not a few among the Greeks who saw the spectacle considered that it prefigured a more terrible reality, the burning of Troy. But of the Trojans, who in increasing numbers thronged the ramparts of the city when the amazing news spread through their streets that the Greek fleet had put to sea on the way home, those who were able at such a time to notice the extraordinary splendor of the sunset thought they there discerned their city illumined by the victories of a long and successful defense and an ever brightening renown in ages to come.<pb n=""/> How could they think otherwise, for did they not perceive the fleet of the enemy in full retreat for the western board, and their camp deserted, as if some sudden portent had driven them to a hurried and disgraceful flight?</p> 
               <p>But lest there should be some furtive design entertained to surprise the city, the gates were kept closed and strict watch was maintained until the morrow. Few were laggards when the sun arose, but all were abroad betimes, impatient to learn if the siege had been finally abandoned. Nor was it long before a band of scouts sent out to ascertain the position of affairs returned with the information that the Greek camp was entirely deserted, and that not a sign was to be seen of any of the enemy lurking in the neighborhood. Thereupon Priam ordered his chariot to be made ready, and with an escort of warriors set out for the camp: he found it as described, empty and silent, the tents still standing, and occupied only by ill-favored dogs, jackals, and wolves, who had speedily discovered the departure of the invaders, and were now prowling about the city of tents searching for bones and offal among the shards of pottery. They slunk away at the approach of Priam, who proceeded without interruption through the camp, until he was checked and struck dumb, while his horses snorted and<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC5784-00000141"/> reared at the apparition of a stupendous wooden pile in the form of a horse, standing alone in an open space among the tents. While Priam, was conjecturing the purpose for which this vast bulk had been constructed, a Greek captive was brought bound before him by some shepherds, who had discovered the wretch prowling in the concealment of the rushes in a marsh, and roughly dragged him into the presence of Priam, who now turned to him for information.</p> 
               <p>Sinon, for so the man gave his name, stated that he had been the unfortunate object of a peculiar grudge, and had in consequence been destined by some of the chiefs to an untimely death, but he had contrived to escape, and had lain hidden until the departure of the Greeks. As he now appeared to be in fear of his life, he was assured of shelter and protection by Priam, who commanded him in return to declare the meaning of this great horse. Sinon replied that the Greeks had become wearied to the last gasp by the length of the siege and their increasing sufferings, despairing of success in the capture of Troy, especially since some of their chieftains had offended Pallas by the violent seizure of her image, the Palladium. They had accordingly taken the resolution to sail for Greece, and in order to appease the wrath of the goddess and<pb n=""/> insure a safe return, had, by direction of Calchas, reared this horse and dedicated it to the injured honor of the divinity; but unwilling that the Trojans should benefit by this propitiatory offering, had made it so lofty that it could enter none of the gates of Troy.</p> 
               <p>The populace from the city were now thronging to the beach, and among them was Laocon, a priest, who, when he heard the story of Sinon, declared it to be false, and that the horse was to be dreaded as the instrument of some artful stratagem; saying which, Laocon violently hurled a spear at the horse, the point struck against the belly, and a hollow sound like a deep groan came from the stricken wood. But the advice of Laocon was unheeded. Blinded in their minds by the gods, who mercifully confuse the senses of those whose destruction is impending, and anxious to secure their city from all future dangers by the introduction of this new Palladium within the city precincts, Priam and his counselors decided that the horse should be at once drawn to the city, and that a breach in the walls ought to be opened sufficient for its entrance if it could not pass through the Scan Gate. Rollers were placed under its feet, and long cables were attached to the legs of the monster, and the multitude, with shouts of joy and exultation<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC5784-00000142"/> ultation, took turns in heaving at the ropes. The people toiled till nightfall, and resumed their labor on the following days. It was found necessary to break down hastily a piece of the wall for the passage of the horse, and towards the third evening, it was well advanced into the heart of the city.</p> 
               <p>But the popular joy was checked for a while by an appalling incident which now occurred. The stars had begun to shine in the western sky, and Laocon, the priest of Apollo, was engaged with his two sons in sacrificing a bullock to Neptune, when two serpents of enormous length, maned, and emitting flame from their eyes and belching gore from their cavernous throats, issued from the sea and taking the land at the point nearest to Troy, steadily and rapidly made their slimy way to the city, and, driving the multitude before them, sought the shrine where Laocon was officiating. They were sent by Pallas to revenge on him the indignity he had offered to the steed dedicated to her, and in obedience to the offended deity, the serpents now seized the patriotic but ill-fated priest and his sons, and enwreathing the resisting but impotent victims in the grip of their tremendous folds, crushed them limb by limb, and left them lifeless at the foot of the altar.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>This terrific event, as might be expected, while it awed also cheered Priam and his people, as affording proof of the sacred and powerful character of the Palladium just introduced into their city; and Priam caused to be proclaimed throughout his capital, by heralds, that the enemy having ingloriously abandoned the shores of the Troad, and Troy being once more secure under the protection of a Palladium, the people could now broach their wine-skins and make merry, and thereafter rest in peace, their slumbers quiet and their dreams pleasant, for war's disastrous storm had passed away from their borders, and their children's children were destined to see the battlements of Troy lit by an ever-increasing glory; for all of which let the gods be praised, and sacrifices of thanksgiving be offered upon the altars of Troy the magnificent.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE LAST BANQUET.</head> 
               <p>THE horse being at last fairly within the walls, Troy was once more considered to be secure from the assaults of her foes by the possession of another Palladium, not to mention the departure of the invading armament, after lingering a decade on the Troad. These circumstances, whose influence on the minds of the people had been intensified by the fearful fate of Laocon and his sons, evidently by the direct sanction of an offended deity, now imparted to all in Troy, from the king to his lowest subject, a feeling of relief and triumph whose overpowering emotions required a vent in jubilance and feasting. It was therefore with gladness that the people heard the voices of the heralds in the streets. Women and children flocked around them eagerly to catch the royal and paternal message of Priam, and all then retired to their homes to draw forth the scanty supply of stores still remaining, and celebrate the<pb n=""/> occasion by feasting as far as it was possible, and thereafter to lie down to slumbers more peaceful and undisturbed by alarms than any they had known for ten years.</p> 
               <p>A solemn and imposing sacrifice of fatlings and heifers was celebrated in the temple of Jupiter Hyrcus, within the citadel, which was attended by King Priam and all the royal family, as an oblation of thanksgiving to the supernal powers who had watched over the destinies of Troy, and safely rescued the god-built city from the assaults of the invader. Sweet was the fragrance of the incense which arose in light clouds from the altar, and floated through the columns of the fane out on the calm air of evening; grateful and exultant were the hearts of those who there testified together their emotions of joy for release from the harassing perils which they had shared in common for so long a period.</p> 
               <p>After the performance of the sacrifice, Priam, with his sons and sons-in-law, and all the foremost elders and captains of Troy, assembled in the banquet hall of the palace, in genial intercourse around the festal board to give expression to the generous social hilarity that the soul craves on occasions of great and unwonted joy and release from long enduring care. Not so ample and sumptuous were the viands as at former feasts in<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC5784-00000144"/> Troy, for war and winter had encroached even upon the provisions of the royal household; but the new sense of security and plenty in the future made ample amends for whatever was lacking in the way of variety or quality. Mirth prevailed among the younger of those present, tempered by the graver bearing and discourse of the elders, and the venerable and kindly aspect of Priam, who contemplated the happiness of his guests with a benignant smile; serenity and content dwelt once more in his eyes, and he stroked his snowy beard with the manner of one who is enjoying without reserve the luxury of forgetting the past and the future, lapped in the seductive ease of the present hour's alluring transports; but he could not altogether resist the shade of sadness which at times passed over the cheerfulness of his countenance, as a driving cloud will darken the sunlit hill-side for a moment; he could not altogether keep back the recollection of Hector and Paris, and so many other noble sons and captains, who in other days had banqueted around his board, but now walked the shades below.</p> 
               <p>Then a bard was summoned and desired to add the thrilling raptures of song to the other pleasures of this festal night. Gladly the poet swept the chords of his harp until they<pb n=""/> awoke responsive music in his soul; then raising his voice, he gave utterance to patriotic strains, in which were celebrated the events of the long war, the heroes who had fallen, and the renown which the Trojans would bequeath as a priceless heritage to their <choice>

Now with profound pathos, then with lofty exultation, the minstrel varied the strophes of his lay, and modulated the melody of his voice, holding captive the rapt attention of his audience, who had all seen and taken part in the scenes which he so vividly described.</p> 
               <p>But as the bard drew near the concluding passages of his triumphal hymn, and filled his listeners with enthusiasm as he portrayed in the most fervid strains the future splendor of Troy, a painful interruption occurred, which disturbed the smooth current of poesy's measures, and brought the lyric to an abrupt conclusion with confusion and awe upon all who were assembled in the banquet hall.</p> 
               <p>Cassandra, the god-inspired priestess and daughter of Priam, it was who now burst into the presence of Priam and his guests, with frenzied eyes, disheveled tresses, and foaming lips, shrieking, "Is this a time for mirth and song? Is this a time for jubilance, for triumph, and security,<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC5784-00000145"/> when the enemy are at our gates, yea, within our walls-within the very heart of Troy?"</p> 
               <p>The voice of the bard ceased, and the guests looked around, startled and appalled by the apparition and the speech of the prophetess, who had so often prophesied in vain, yet always terrified her hearers at first by the fury of her manner, so like that of the Delphic Pythoness, and the earnestness of conviction with which she uttered her warnings. But Priam, not unused to the ravings of his daughter, and accustomed by age and station to act with deliberation and dignity, enjoined the guests not to be disturbed by her unseasonable appearance: then addressing his daughter, with all the former careworn expression in his face again, he said: "Peace, Cassandra! Is it not enough that we have been burdened with your mad predictions so often in time past, and patiently endured them for your sake, that you must needs destroy the pleasures of this unequaled hour of triumph vouchsafed us by the gods in partial return for all our sorrows and pains, all our losses and travail of body and soul for ten slow-revolving years. Peace! No more let your unwholesome forebodings disturb the tranquillity of Troy,-whose storms have past forever, and whose habitants shall henceforth dwell in the sunshine of<pb n=""/> that prosperity which is a foretaste of the serene and immortal raptures of the Elysian plains."</p> 
               <p>"O Apollo, Apollo! for this once have pity on me; for this once, O Apollo! forget the affront I offered thee when I refused thee my love; for this once annul the curse of disbelief which ever since attends on my prophecies, however true; for this once, I beseech thee, O Apollo! let them hear and believe and be spared the thunderbolt of doom that is but now ready to fall. For this once let them believe and save themselves and Troy; then slay me, if thou wilt, or strike me dumb forever; but let me, O Apollo! for this only time speak so that they shall believe; then let me die, so my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my country are saved. O that they could see as I see how swiftly destruction approaches! O my father and my native land, why will ye not listen to the voice of the god that speaks through me, and live!" So cried Cassandra, clasping her clinched fingers over her forehead, and gazing into futurity with dry lids and eyeballs distended and fire-blazing with horror at the scenes so vividly apparent to her mental vision.</p> 
               <p>"Speak, my daughter, and tell us calmly what it is you dread," said Priam, as if half convinced that there might be some occult foundation for the<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC5784-00000146"/> oracular utterances of Cassandra at a time when apparently so little likely to be true. "Speak, yet be not offended if we do not believe. If we have not hitherto placed credence in your warnings, why should we now, when there is so little seeming reason for them to be declared?"</p> 
               <p>"But have not my warnings always come to pass: have they not always been fulfilled when the time foretold was ripe for their accomplishment?"</p> 
               <p>Priam made no reply, for he remembered too well how often this had been the fact. And Cassandra continued, in a more calm but not less earnest strain: "Listen, O king, and all ye noble Trojans; I tell you what is true, and at the peril of immediate destruction can you alone disregard what I am about to disclose. The horse it is which now threatens impending ruin upon us all. Within that horse armed men are hidden, waiting for the appointed hour, in order to come forth and strike the fatal blow. This very night the danger is to be met and averted, and that without delay."</p> 
               <p>"How prove you such an astounding tale?" inquired Priam.</p> 
               <p>"Has it not been declared to me by Apollo himself, breathing the inspiration of future events into my very soul?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"That is all very well, but have we not on the other hand ample indication that the horse is the Palladium of Troy under the special protection of Pallas? No, daughter Cassandra, what thou sayest cannot be possible," replied Priam, entrenched in his new sense of security, which with reason made him question the presence of danger.</p> 
               <p>But murmurs of disapprobation from the more elderly and judicious of the guests indicated that Priam's incredulity was not wholly shared by others present; and Polydamas, speaking for them, said deliberately: "Not so, O king. The circumstance that the voice of the prophetess is heard in dire warnings at apparently such an auspicious hour seems to us rather a portent not lightly to be disregarded, especially provided for our safety by the gods."</p> 
               <p>"Royal father," again pleaded Cassandra, "hearken to the counsels of Polydamas; and in proof of what I say, let Helen, the Greek woman, be summoned and examined here in the presence of the collected wisdom of Troy."</p> 
               <p>This brought Deiphobus, Helen's husband, to his feet, exclaiming bitterly, "I appeal to you, King Priam, if it be not time to put a stop to the raving babblings of this maniac priestess, when, not satisfied with wearying our ears and<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC5784-00000147"/> disturbing our joys by foretelling impossible calamities, she also dares to compromise the wife of the chief captain of Troy in her imaginary presages of evil."</p> 
               <p>The words of Deiphobus would doubtless have turned the scale in the wavering mind of Priam, who, having made up his mind that Cassandra's warnings were false, saw no reason to abandon his first conclusion, if he had not been keen enough to perceive, before he spoke in reply, that it would be unadvisable to ignore the opinion of such men as Antenor and Polydamas. So he replied: "Let this wrangling cease; and thou, Deiphobus, send a herald to conduct Helen hither, or, if you prefer, go in search of her yourself. She is beyond question entirely innocent of base designs, but for her sake let her come before us, by her appearance and disavowal in person the more effectively to disprove the suspicions of these worthy men, who have so long been the stay of our kingdom."</p> 
               <p>Deiphobus, conscious that the life of Helen was now in imminent peril, vague suspicion being sufficient to lead the alarmed Trojans in the banqueting hall to hurl instant destruction on her head, went himself to conduct her to the presence of the king. He found Helen in their apartments, and briefly disclosed to her the purport<pb n=""/> port of his errand. She heard the appalling message mute with horror, as she realized to what a crisis she had arrived without the slightest warning. But she soon recovered speech and the control of her faculties, and saw at a glance that safety was to be found alone in obeying the summons of Priam, and boldly meeting Cassandra face to face: a daughter of the Spartan line might be awed, but should not be overcome by the ravings of a frenzied priestess, nor prevented from returning to Hermione and to Sparta.</p> 
               <p>"I am ready to meet Cassandra; nothing she can say will concern or disturb me," said Helen, following Deiphobus across the dark court-yard of the citadel, whose shadowy gloom was made the more grim by the wavering smoky flame of the pine torch carried by the link boy who walked before them. The entrance of Helen into the banqueting hall evidently had a reassuring effect on many of the guests, for her calm and apparently voluntary appearance was almost a proof of her innocence of premeditated guilt.</p> 
               <p>Walking up to the throne of Priam with unfaltering step and unsurpassed majesty, Helen met the king with a reverential smile, and said: "Father Priam, you have sent for me to appear<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC5784-00000148"/> before you and your assembled guests, without giving me time for the preparation suitable for such an occasion. But I have delayed not. I am come, and now with reverence do I ask what is your pleasure with me?"</p> 
               <p>"Daughter," replied Priam, benignantly yielding to the confidence of her mien and the irresistible influence of her matchless beauty, "I have summoned thee in compliance with the wishes of these who are here present, men to whose patriotism and wisdom it seemed expedient to defer. I know the hour is unseasonable, the occasion unpleasing, but I doubt not the result will redound to the increase of our esteem and affection for you. Cassandra waits to declare to you personally the cause that hath brought you hither." Then looking towards Cassandra, Priam said: "Now is your time to repeat the revelations of Apollo, if haply they be real. Let Helen hear what you have declared to me."</p> 
               <p>Cassandra advanced, and sternly facing the woman she accused, said: "I have been inspired by Apollo himself to warn my countrymen to beware of the horse which they have so hastily accepted as a Palladium, and imprudently admitted within the Trojan walls. There is ruin lurking in the womb of that horse,-ruin for<pb n=""/> Troy. Armed men are concealed therein ready to leap forth at the appointed hour; and I charge you, Helen of Sparta, who have been the cause of such unutterable woes,-I charge you by the authority of Apollo the omniscient, and in presence of King Priam and all these grave elders and veteran chieftains, with knowledge and participation in the scheme which has been devised against the existence of Troy, and is destined to be carried into execution this very night, with not only your connivance but also your active assistance."</p> 
               <p>"Helen of Sparta, what have you to say in defense of yourself, in reply to the divinely inspired accusations of Cassandra?" demanded Priam, while Deiphobus instinctively stepped closer to his wife, as if to shield her from the angry, anxious faces glaring fiercely upon her, and the rising murmurs of wrath which arose from all parts of the hall.</p> 
               <p>Pale but collected,-there are some natures that are the most self-possessed in moments of the most imminent peril,-Helen deliberated a moment, and then spoke as follows, in slow and measured words, for her life depended on what she could now say in self-defense, and only by the most complete control over the agitation which secretly convulsed her soul, could she<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC5784-00000149"/> succeed in averting what now seemed an inevitable doom: "I thank you for not condemning me unheard, and yet it would avail but little for me to speak now, a lone and defenseless woman, were it not, O Priam, son of Laomedon, that I know that justice sways your judgment and actuates all your royal decrees. I ask not for mercy, but for justice. If I cannot clear my skirts of the damning guilt of which I am accused, delay not to wreak your will upon me, for what am I when the lives of so many thousands are supposed to be at stake. But if the charges brought against me are not proved, let wrath and suspicion cease, and still let justice temper your decision, and grant that the pittance of life be left to me which it is the right of the gods alone to take away from the innocent.</p> 
               <p>"And what are those charges which the priestess of Apollo has flung in my face, as if I, who for ten years have lived with the women in the Pergamus apart from all participation in the war or communication with the foe,-as if I could interpret the predictions of a god, or the secret designs of the enemy, and were myself a participant in the deadly treason alleged? Cassandra asserts that danger lurks in the horse; she says that Apollo himself has so divulged the character<pb n=""/> ter of the peril to her. Is it indeed thus? doth Apollo say one thing and Pallas another? doth Apollo call that an engine of destruction which Pallas has proved to us in the sight of all Troy to be a sacred Palladium, under her particular tutelage? But how are we to ascertain the fact that it is as Cassandra affirms without putting her assertions to the trial? Ye are all valiant, yet which one of you, who are scarred with the wounds of many battles, will venture forth and attempt what cost Laocon his life and the life of his innocent offspring, left dead at the foot of the altar? Let one of your number take his sword or his spear and smite open the sides of the Palladium, and discover for our satisfaction and safety the peril that hides within, for how otherwise can you prove that it is as Cassandra declares?"</p> 
               <p>Helen glanced around the hall with a look of unutterable scorn, and resumed: "Not one stirs, not one dares to trifle with the hallowed talisman of the virgin goddess. But do ye not perceive that your fear and hesitation to act on my suggestion prove your belief that the horse is the Palladium of Troy rather than a monster designed for your destruction? for supposing that it is indeed as Cassandra assumes, that the threatened peril is imminent, yea, a danger that<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC5784-00000150"/> is to fall on this very night, the only way to prevent the mischief is to burst open the Palladium this moment, for by the morrow it will be too late; and yet not one dares to go forth and test the character of the sacred horse. In your veneration for the Palladium I read my vindication. But Cassandra declares further and more specifically that armed men are concealed in the horse, forming a fatal ambuscade. A pretty tale, indeed, for at best only a score or two could find room in such a contracted space; and are the Trojans, who for ten years have resisted the fleets and armies and heroes of all Greece, to be frightened and overcome by a mere handful of men cramped and cooped within a wooden horse, and deserted by their friends,-yes deserted in a hostile land, for are not the Greeks gone? did we not see their ships sailing away? did you not walk through their deserted camp, and with your own eyes behold the last vestige of that brave host which came here to destroy, and fled in dismay, baffled and discomfited? Perhaps even now they are rocking on the tempestuous waves, tossed to the skies or hurled to the depths, and calling on the gods to help them in vain; for is not the storm arising? do I not hear the shrill winds whistling around these towers, and did not I see the snows falling as<pb n=""/> came to this hall to attend your summons? Go to! Let this tale be babbled to children, that the bravest of the Trojans were cowed by the shadow of the very Palladium under whose protection they had confided themselves.</p> 
               <p>"But Cassandra makes even a graver charge than this,-graver so far as I am concerned. She affirms that I know of these things and am implicated in a conspiracy to betray and destroy this city. Now, it is known to all present that, desiring to avert the evils which threatened in consequence of my coming to Troy,-would to the gods I had never come!-I have at various times done all in my power to procure my restoration to Menelaus and to Sparta, not because I wearied of Troy and of my friends here, but because I desired to save Troy from the baneful results of my presence in this town. Antenor, the wise chieftain who sits yonder, can testify, and so could Hector were he living,-that noble and pious and great-hearted hero, that just and generous patriot and brother, who was always my friend, and who knew the misery which devoured my soul on account of the troubles I had wrought by my fault,-he could testify how I sought to return to Greece when the embassy was here, although by doing so I should exchange the steadfast affection of Paris<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC5784-00000151"/> for the wrath of an infuriated husband. And am I the woman who am now charged with seeking the destruction of this Troy which I have yearned to save? And as for being engaged in a plot for that purpose, with whom should it be? With the Greeks, who are now far away on their voyage home? or perhaps it is with the shadowy warriors who are said to be pent up within the Palladium. Dangerous indeed must be such a conspiracy; one feeble woman and a scanty band of warriors whose very existence is not proven, leagued together for the overthrow of a city well garrisoned with the veterans of a ten years' war. But granting that such a plot might be highly dangerous, let that man arise and come forward who can testify and prove that since the day I first stepped foot on the Troad to this very hour I have spoken or held any communication whatever with one of my countrymen, or with any one connected with the invading host."</p> 
               <p>Helen paused and deliberately cast her eyes over her auditors, but no one arose or spoke in corroboration of the accusations of Cassandra, although there were not wanting some among those present who hated the Spartan queen to the degree that they would have been only too glad to crush her out of existence on the first<pb n=""/> justifiable pretext. In the faces of others she saw an expression of intense relief, resultant from the allaying of the apprehensions aroused by the prophetess, and conviction that the words of the Spartan queen were weighty with arguments that could not be gainsayed. Even the countenance of Cassandra showed that she was baffled, and half-doubted in her own mind whether the warnings which had issued from her lips were not, after all, empty of meaning and void.</p> 
               <p>Reassured by the very perceptible effect produced by her language, Helen added in conclusion: "And now, O King Priam, and all ye who are present and have listened patiently to my plea, it is for you to judge whether the alleged warnings of Apollo are worthy of credit as coming from a god, and action to be taken accordingly, or whether being so evidently baseless and incredible, they should be dismissed from further consideration, together with the charges on which my life is in jeopardy. May the just gods direct your minds to an impartial decision!"</p> 
               <p>Priam, when Helen had ceased, asked of her, "Hast thou aught else to say in defense of thyself?"</p> 
               <p>"Nothing more," she replied, "except again to thank you for the patient hearing which you have granted to an erring woman, who, whether<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC5784-00000152"/> by her own fault or perchance as the instrument of Fate, has brought trouble on Troy. I would also ask that I be now permitted to withdraw to apartments, if it be pleasing to you."</p> 
               <p>Priam waited a moment to give any who might choose an opportunity to express their sentiments, but only Antenor arose and briefly said: "The woman has spoken truly; it is even as she has started; I well remember bow earnestly she besought me to persuade Paris to allow her to return to Sparta with the ambassadors in order that she might thus avert war from our borders; with tears she bewailed the woes which she foresaw were to come upon our unhappy country."</p> 
               <p>Cassandra now attempted to resume her prophetic utterances, but the doubt in herself so perceptible in her manner caused Priam to say: "No more of this, Cassandra; you have, it is true, foretold in former times events that have been fulfilled, but what you now consider the inspired predictions of Apollo must be the suggestions of an evil demon fled with mischief towards innocent mortals; for Apollo would not prophecy what is false, as has been abundantly proved must be the case with the accusations and forebodings, with which you have afflicted us this night."</p> 
               <p>Deathly pale, great drops of sweat on her<pb n=""/> brow, and trembling violently, Cassandra sank to the floor groaning, "Alas, my country!" The failure to persuade her hearers to take action on a question of such awful importance, and the reaction resulting from the frenzy of abortive inspiration seemed to produce a collapse of all her powers. Handmaids were summoned to bear Cassandra from the hall, and Priam then pronounced these words: "Helen, daughter of Tyndarus, to me it seems that you are innocent of the charges preferred against you; and it is not the quality of Trojan justice to punish without proof of crime. We are all fallible; time and the Fates, in whose mysterious trust are the destinies of nations, can alone decide who this night hath spoken the truth, for to test the nature of the Palladium, to discover whether danger lurks within it or no, would be rash indeed after the wretched fate of Laocon, and might bring destruction upon us all." Priam paused to reflect, and then, mindful of a former promise, the good old king resumed: "Helen, although you are now the wife of Deiphobus, still my royal word which I gave to you shall not be broken. The Greeks having at length left my kingdom and sailed for home, you are now, in pursuance of my agreement, at liberty to go whither you will; either to tarry here with us, as will be<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC5784-00000153"/> pleasing to me and to Deiphobus your husband, or to go hence and seek a return to Greece; none shall hinder you from either course, and may you be happy! And now return to your halls unmolested, and offer sacrifices on the morrow to the gods who this night have shielded your head from the wrath of men."</p> 
               <p>But Helen quickly made reply: "Truly they are gone whom some days ago I might willingly have rejoined. They have deserted me. Even Menelaus, whose anger and jealousy it was that stimulated the Greeks to come hither, has at last given me over. And now I am content to abide here, as Fate has decreed, until the Greeks choose to come after me again."</p> 
               <p>"As you will," replied the benevolent old monarch, not perceiving the fell import which was concealed in these few and apparently friendly words, as the claw of the tigress lies hooded in the treacherous fur, when she is about to strike.</p> 
               <p>Making a reverential obeisance to the king, Helen passed by the rows of guests, who but a short space before had thirsted for her blood, and walked calmly forth from the tribunal which she had scarcely expected to leave alive and acquitted,-so well did she know how easily popular suspicion is aroused and how hardly it is allayed, and how swiftly and often unjustly the<pb n=""/> sudden, heedless wrath of the unthinking many is wreaked upon its victims. But composed as Helen appeared in her outward mien, she could not entirely disguise the scorn and defiance which involuntarily curled her lip, and the quivering of the nostrils and flash of the eyes which betrayed the violence of her emotions,-emotions which could only be appeased in blood. She, a queen of Sparta, forced to sue for her life to the Trojans, because, forsooth, a frenzied priestess had chosen to make her the object of alarms suggested by a distempered brain! Never, should such an insult happen to her again in Troy! So she talked with herself as she stepped forth into the gloom of night, leaving behind her the gleam of torches and sparkling goblets, and the confused voices of men who returned from weighing her life in the balances, to quaff once more the ruby wine with jest and song, little weening what a fury they had let loose when they allowed Helen to escape from their grasp.</p> 
               <p>But although Helen had been cleared because no sufficient evidence could be adduced to prove her guilt or the perilous character of the horse, yet an uneasy feeling of mistrust still lurked in the bosom of many in the festal hall,-a vague sense of impending doom, like the sullen silence which broods over the storm-blackened landscape<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC5784-00000154"/> scape before the first flash of the lightning and the fall of the thunderbolt. Futile was every attempt to resume the spontaneous hilarity which had been disturbed by the entrance of Cassandra. The scene which had just transpired had been of too painful a character, the mysterious forebodings which it left behind were too poignant, to permit a return of the former gayety of spirit. Attempts there were to revive the genial converse of the occasion, but the joy and the triumph of the banquet had dissipated itself beyond recall, as the aromatic odor of rare wines evaporates when opened, and leaves them flat and insipid. Therefore Priam dismissed the guests, thanking them for their presence, bidding them forget the disorders of the evening in pleasing slumbers, and making a spiritless allusion to the future glories of Troy, as he expressed the hope that many banquets more happy than this had been might be permitted to them again. The king then feebly descended from the throne, and slowly returned to the apartment of his queen.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter">

               <head>XVII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE SEERS PREDICTION FULFILLED.</head> 
               <p>THE guests who had supped with Priam and witnessed the ordeal through which Helen had passed unscathed, dispersed, and one by one repaired to their dwellings, and were soon wrapped in slumber. But before the return of Deiphobus to her apartment, Helen had a brief interval allowed her to reflect, not on the momentous scene from which she had just escaped with life, for time was too precious now to waste on past events, however recent and impressive, but on the stupendous crisis at hand, whose decision rested with her. She held in her power the destinies of nations, that solitary woman who so shortly before stood on the border line that divides this world from the next. But the time for deliberation or faltering had passed; it was instead a time for cool but rapid and determined action. Nor was Helen the woman to hesitate now. Circumstances arising unexpectedly, yet naturally and inevitably out of her first error,<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC5784-00000155"/> and reaching dimensions beyond her control, had shaped her character and evolved the unbending iron traits inherited from Spartan ancestry, which might have lain dormant if her life had always passed unruffled amid the tranquil scenes of her childhood,-traits which, in a nobler cause than liberation of self from the abyss into which crime had plunged her, would have made of her a heroine. No, the hour for deliberation had passed forever. Thirst for revenge and for freedom, longing for her husband, her child, and her native land, and the rapid approach of the hour when the Greeks would be marching up from the beach, together with the shuddering recollection of the fate she had just escaped, all urged Helen to hasten without a moment's delay to the execution of her part in the closing scenes of the great drama.</p> 
               <p>Therefore muffling her face in the mantle of her handmaid, Helen descended from the citadel and proceeded to the spot where the horse stood alone in the city, not far from the Pergamus. The few Trojans abroad would scarcely have recognized Helen in her disguise, it was so dark, and were either too besotted with wine or too careless of her existence to suspect or molest the woman groping her way through the gloom of a rising storm. Yet apparently this was an act of<pb n=""/> the utmost hazard; but her recent escape had led Helen to consider that Fortune was on her side, while her isolated condition, when such awful events were impending, made her yearn, woman as she was, to communicate with her friends and partners in the desperate game before the final step should be taken. When she reached the horse, she paced around the vaguely outlined shape, towering phantom-like above her, shaken by overpowering emotions. Concealed within its hollow sides were the men who were to overthrow this mighty city and work out her restoration to Greece. A word of hers would hurl these chieftains to swift destruction and save Troy. But she was not there to betray, but to encourage her liberators by the assurance that she was ready to carry out the part assigned to her, and that all things were propitious for the success of the hazardous undertaking. Therefore, Helen sang to them words of cheer in the Doric tongue, and Ulysses, who had recently seen her, told his companions it was Helen they heard. They thrilled with the rise and fall of that mellow and delicious voice: some it reminded of their wives afar off moaning for them by their lonely hearths; others recalled the time when they last heard her speak, years and years agone in the dim past, when as suitors of Helen they tarried at Sparta,<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC5784-00000156"/> and lived and longed for her alone. Instinctively these heroes, scarred by a ten years' war, and weary of their close confinement in the narrow interior of the wooden horse, grasped their sword-hilts, and some of them started to emerge into the open air and to the accomplishment of the final scene in the tragedy; but the set hour was not yet, and Ulysses restrained their impatience, and urged them to remain quiet a while longer.</p> 
               <p>Helen after this returned to the citadel and the apartment of Deiphobus, who shortly came in from the banquet. At dead of night, when the inhabitants of Troy, exhausted by the excitement of the two previous days, and torpid with wine or secure in the fancied safety of the city, lay asleep, and when the whole town was hushed in repose, the Greeks inclosed within the horse withdrew the slide, and emerging, dropped one by one to the ground by a rope. The night was shrouded in gloom, and a pall of snow which had quietly, swiftly, and unexpectedly descended, muffled the sound of footsteps. The citadel was the point which the invaders first attempted, because while that impregnable fortress continued garrisoned and victualed, the capture <choice>
                     <sic/>
                     <corr>of</corr>
                  </choice> Troy remained doubtful and incomplete. As concerted, the Pergamus was to be betrayed by the agency<pb n=""/> of Helen herself. But the handful of men now in the city relied on reinforcements that were to insure possession of the city, while the men in the horse seized the citadel, and entrance for these reinforcements was rendered easy through the unguarded breach made for the ingress of the horse. Sinon, whose story had been so fatally credited, had been little noticed after his release by his captors, and, easily eluding them, had lurked near the sea-shore until the night after the horse was fairly within the walls of Troy. He then, when the obscurity of evening came on, kindled a fire of brushwood on the beach, which caused no apprehension among the Trojans, as they mistook it for a fire built by the shepherds to warm themselves and keep away the wolves. But it was a signal-fire informing the Greeks on the watch at Tenedos that the time to strike the final blow had come. Forthwith they set their fleet in motion, and, favored by the darkness of the night, soon reached the Trojan shore again, landed, and marched with all speed for the city, which they knew they had but to reach and it would fall into their hands.</p> 
               <p>Helen, after returning to the citadel, drugged wine with nepenthe, and ordered her maid to bear it forth and offer it to the guards who watched the gates of the Pergamus, telling them<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC5784-00000157"/> that her mistress, mindful of their cares and toils, desired to show her good-will by sending them pleasant wine for their refreshment. They, faithful but unsuspicious, and pleased by this mark of favor, gladly accepted the proffered boon, and quaffed the rosy wine with many a merry jest exchanged with the ripe-lipped girl who presented the bowl to their bearded mouths; nor was it long ere they succumbed to the drowsy liquor, and sunk into slumberous oblivion. Helen after this offered a goblet brimming with the same subtle draught to Deiphobus, saying: "My lord, it is well after trouble to seek repose, and red wine is the balm bestowed by the gods to soothe the languors of the heroic warrior's wearied limbs. Drink, my noble spouse, out of this beaker from which thy brother Paris was wont to quench his thirst; and then, for thou must be jaded, and Troy is now safe, let us to our accustomed couch."</p> 
               <p>Deiphobus, suspecting no guile in the dark eyes that gazed confidently into his, drained the goblet, but had scarcely disrobed himself and laid his head on the pillow, when he too was helpless under the influence of the potion she had administered. Helen then arrayed herself in a tunic of soft Lydian wool dyed in purple and faced with minever, for it was now winter; the<pb n=""/> garment was bound under the breasts with a glittering zone, and fell in massive folds to her feet. A carcanet of pearls circled her shapely neck, and her brow was crowned by a tiara of golden fretwork brought from Phnicia, in whose centre blazed a superb carbuncle that rivaled the light of the orbs which gleamed through the long fringes of her eyelids. This night she was to celebrate her second nuptials with Menelaus, and it behooved her to be arrayed as became the queen of Sparta and the wife of King Menelaus. Whatever resentment he might still retain towards her she was resolved should now entirely and forever disappear before the influence of the undimmed and extraordinary beauty of the woman whose peerless charms had shaken the peace of the world. Whatever be the price, she must now regain his love, and with it her daughter and her forfeited position of queen of Laconia.</p> 
               <p>These preparations completed, Helen lightly stole to the flat roof and listened for sounds betokening that the Greeks had commenced their operations; nor did she have long to wait, for the band of chieftains who had descended from the horse had immediately made for the Pergamus, led by Menelaus, whose eagerness to see Helen and revenge his own and her wrongs, gave speed to his impatient feet and made him<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC5784-00000158"/> outstrip his comrades, although Ulysses enjoined caution and prudence in their advance. Helen, her hearing intensified by anxious expectation, soon discerned the approach of the Greeks. She could not be mistaken; the sound, a low blending of whispering voices and hurrying steps, could not be misunderstood. She trembled with the violence of her agitation, but yet retained her self-command, for there was one more scene to be enacted before she could feel secure, and haste was needed, lest the Trojans discover her designs and slay her before her countrymen could release her from their power. She hurried silently down to the small postern gate of the citadel. The keeper was sprawled on a stone seat drunk and heard not her light, noiseless step. The gate was fastened by a massive iron bar laid across it and resting in a socket let into the wall at each side. It required the whole strength of a strong man to remove it, and at any other time Helen could not have taken it out without great difficulty, but now, under the excitement of the occasion, she lifted the bar with ease and silently laid it in a corner, and retired to await the result.</p> 
               <p>But a few moments elapsed, and Ulysses and Menelaus thrust open the gate, which groaned on its hinges; the sleeping sentry, half aroused,<pb n=""/> leaped up and cried instinctively, "The foe! The foe! To arms!" but ere he could say more a sword silenced his voice forever. Immediately the shadowy court of the citadel was thronged with dusky figures swarming in through the gate. Foremost among them Helen from her hiding-place discerned Ulysses guiding Menelaus to the door of her apartments. Springing forth from her concealment, she grasped Menelaus by the hand and rapidly led him to her chamber, raised the massive curtain, and without uttering a word, pointed significantly to Deiphobus sleeping heavily on the couch. But the shouts and cries now echoing around the palace disturbed the slumbering captain, and he started up, and by the dim light beheld armed men stealthily approaching his bed. Instantly he groped for his trusty sword, which was always placed under his pillow when he slept; but Helen, in whose arms he had lain but an hour ago, had withdrawn it, and he was now defenseless. Desperate but brief was the resistance of Deiphobus, for the sword of Menelaus, weighted with the accumulated wrath of fifteen years, smote him to the floor, and quickly made an end of the unfortunate hero.</p> 
               <p>The garrison of the citadel, bewildered and panic-struck, were soon overpowered and slain.<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC5784-00000159"/> A domestic first communicated the dreadful tidings to Priam, who was deep in his first sleep, bursting into the apartment and shouting, "Arise, O Priam! the Greeks are upon us, and the last hour of Troy has come!"</p> 
               <p>"Is it even so?" responded the old monarch, profoundly moved. "Cassandra, Cassandra! why did the gods blind our eyes that we should not believe thy warnings?" Then turning to his wife, Priam said: "Arise, Hecuba; the prediction of sacus is fulfilled; the fire-brand which you brought forth has fallen upon Troy. The Fates can alone declare why from us should proceed the instrument of our ruin. Let us hasten to the altar of Jove, there at least to die."</p> 
               <p>And thither, by a secret passage, the stricken pair hurried with tottering steps and quaking knees, while the ever increasing sounds of the tumult smote on their ears from all parts of the Pergamus. Gathered around the altar of Jupiter Hercus, Priam and Hecuba found many of their offspring clinging to that spot for refuge in the vain hope of mercy and safety, tearing their hair and rending the air with shrieks and groans. But nothing availed to save when the ruthless invaders crowded into the sacred inclosure. Priam was dragged to the pavement by his gray hairs and slain, and his headless trunk was drawn<pb n=""/> to the shore in the dust. Hecuba, the noble mother of Hector and Paris, was made a captive, to be led away into foreign lands. The same fate befell all her daughters. Andromache, the lorn widow of Hector, was doomed to witness the slaughter of her little son, Astyanax, torn from her arms by a ruthless soldier and hurled from the battlements, while she herself was destined to be the concubine and water-bearer for a stranger in lands beyond the moaning sea.</p> 
               <p>While these scenes were occurring in the Pergamus, fire, bloodshed, and rapine were running riot throughout the city. The invaders were now pouring into the town by thousands from the beach. A temporary check was given them by a body of Trojans, who fought under neas. He dwelt in a remote quarter of Troy, in his father's palace, and when aroused by the sounds of danger, armed himself and hastened towards the citadel, collecting together what straggling Trojans he met. With these he encountered the Greeks and was presenting a brave front to their attack, when they took him in the rear and cut off his forces. He barely escaped by leaping over a garden wall, and returned to his house to look after the safety of his family. This was all the resistance of any consequence which the Greeks encountered on this terrible night. Soon<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC5784-00000160"/> fire was set to many buildings, and louder and louder grew the crackling and rumbling of the flames, which rapidly devoured the wooden dwellings, and through vast clouds of smoke darted upwards like forked lightnings, accompanied with dense showers of fiery stars, and causing the black vault of the heavens to glow as if it were an oven. The new fallen snow which lay on the roofs was like blood in the fearful light, and added to the infernal horrors of that tremendous scene; while the confused din of falling buildings, and the shrieks of women and the yells of men maddened with slaughter, blended their discordant sounds with the roar of the conflagration, whose thunders were deepened by the fury of an increasing tempest. And when at last the gray light of dawn appeared, unsightly heaps of ashes and smouldering embers, intermingled with calcined bones and piles of blackened ruins and lurid volumes of smoke rolling up to the skies, were alone to be seen where Troy had stood. A city and a nation had passed out of existence.</p>

               <head>XVIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">RETURN OF THE QUEEN.</head> 
               <p>FOR ten years unremitting watch had been maintained upon the top of the royal palace of Agamemnon for the first glimpse of the beacon fire which was to announce the fall of Troy. Ten long, weary years! and during that interval the watchman had nightly kept his lonely vigil there, and the wives and children of Hellas had waited and wept for the sight of the welcome flame that was to foretell the return of their husbands and fathers. Ten years! how slow they pass when freighted with suspense and despair.</p> 
               <p>But ten years must at last come to an end, and thus these ten years of the siege of Troy came and went; and on a certain night when the watchman of Mycen was scarce able to drive sleep from his drowsy eyelids, and was questioning to himself how much longer he might have to wait for the appointed signal, a light suddenly smote his sight, bursting forth on the very summit he had<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC5784-00000161"/> observed so long in vain. Could it be? Yes, it was indeed the beacon fire for which he had watched ten years; there it blazed at last against the clear sky, on the crest of Mount Arachnus, growing brighter and brighter each moment, as if rejoicing to proclaim the good tidings to Greece.</p> 
               <p>Twenty-four hours had elapsed since the surprise of Troy. The once flourishing city was now nothing but a desolation, doomed henceforth to be tenanted alone by the bat, the scorpion and the adder, the owl and the jackal, mournful to behold until such time as Pan should be moved by the melancholy aspect of the ruins, and cause lush grasses and delicate maiden-hair, creeping. ivies and scarlet poppies, to take root there and overgrow the waste places, and reclaim them as a portion of his glorious domains. The Greeks had by this time entirely deserted the site of Troy, and returned to their ships with the captive women and plunder they had saved from the general wreck and slaughter, and were preparing to set sail for home, when Agamemnon sent men to the highest point of Mount Ida, where, as previously arranged, they were ordered to kindle a huge fire of timber as a signal to declare the success of the expedition, a harbinger of glad tidings to distant lands. On the topmost ridge<pb n=""/> of the island of Lemnos a heap of wood had been waiting ten years to be lighted. The islanders had seen the eastern sky red with the burning of Troy, and were now on the alert for the designated signal. When they discovered the ruddy star on the brow of Mount Ida, they applied the torch to their beacon; the watchman stationed on Mount Athos saw the balefire of Lemnos, and hastened to light his own. Rugged Macetas took up the tidings and sent them to the hills of Euba, and so from peak to peak the news was flashed, and all the tribes of Greece learned in a night of the destruction of Troy.</p> 
               <p>In a few months the vessels of the fleet began to arrive on the coast of Greece with the scarred and weather-browned warriors and mariners who had survived the long perils by sea and by land. Agamemnon, the King of Men, saw once more the towers of Mycen rising over the barley fields of Argolis, and at the joyous sight felt himself repaid for his long absence from home. The road were thronged with peasantry singing choral songs, and leading fat oxen crowned with flowers for thank-offerings to the gods, and the streets of his capital were lined with the happy faces of his subjects. Those whom he had left frolicking urchins he now saw as young men, rending the air with their acclaims, and eager to<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC5784-00000162"/> follow the triumphant hero to the capture of another Troy. His felicity was complete when Queen Clytemnstra, his wife, met him at the palace gate and welcomed him back to Greece and to his loyal people of Mycen, with every appearance of sincerity and joy. But during his absence, unknown to him, she had consorted with gisthus, and with him conspired to assassinate Agamemnon on his return; and that very night, when bathing in preparation for the banquet that had been made ready, all unsuspicious of the fell designs of his queen, Agamemnon was surprised by her, assisted by her paramour and his creatures, and slain, together with Cassandra, whom he had brought with him, and who foretold the approaching catastrophe, but, as usual, in vain.</p> 
               <p>Most of the surviving chieftains of the expedition reached their homes and kingdoms in safety after various adventures. Ulysses was the most unfortunate of all. His wanderings with his fleet extended over the whole Mediterranean, during which time he gradually lost all his ships and companions, and was cast away several times on lonely islands; not until he had been absent from Ithaca twenty years did he succeed at last in reaching once more his isolated little kingdom. There he found that his faithful wife, Penelope, had for many months been harassed by suitors<pb n=""/> from the neighboring coasts, who sought her hand in marriage, claiming that Ulysses must have long since perished. Finally, wearied by the importunities of these men, who devoured the substance of the island in riotous living, she promised to select one from their number when she had finished a large and exquisitely worked garment which she was weaving. They consented to the completion of her task, but each night she unraveled what she had woven during the day, and thus, unknown to her suitors, deferred the hour for choosing a husband from their number, until on a certain day Ulysses unexpectedly arrived on the island disguised by his raiment. It was necessary for him to proceed with caution, lest the suitors, knowing of his return, should slay him. This he was the more able to do since he was unrecognized by any, with the exception of Argus, a hound who had accompanied Ulysses in the chase twenty years before this, and was now feeble with age; he recollected his master, and, crawling to his feet, sought to lick the well-remembered hand and died. Disclosing himself to a few trusty followers, and bringing his usual wariness and ingenuity to aid, Ulysses succeeded in circumventing and slaughtering the suitors and their confederates, and after satisfying his subjects that he was<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC5784-00000163"/> indeed their long lost king, regained possession of Ithaca. In the pure rapture of their reunion Penelope and Ulysses found compensation for the years of separation, hardship, and suspense which each had endured.</p> 
               <p>Of the Trojan chiefs, Antenor and neas alone escaped, each attended by a handful of fugitives, whom they found lurking in the mountains after the departure of the Greeks. The former fled through the Dardan Gate to the shores of the stormy Euxine, where, with the assistance of the woodmen dwelling in that untravelled region, ship timbers were hewn in the dense forests and a fleet was constructed, in which he glided down the rapid Hellespont, through the gean, and up the Adriatic, until at the mouths of the river Eridanus he established a colony of Trojans. neas, on the other hand, made good his escape to the lower parts of Mysia, with Ascanius, his son, and his old father, Anchises, whom he bore on his back out of the burning city, but Creusa his wife was lost in the confusion of the flight. From the Mysians neas obtained several galleys, and after various vicissitudes, succeeded at last in making a prosperous settlement in Hesperia, near the Tiber, where he wedded Lavinia the daughter of a neighboring king.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>And Helen, what of her after the fall of the people she had destroyed? Deiphobus being murdered, and no longer an obstacle in the way of her return, Menelaus accompanied her back to his galley, where he became reconciled to her, and some days later sailed for Greece with his thrice-wedded spouse. Off Sunium's rocky steep a heavy sea came on board the royal galley and washed off Phrontis, his trusty pilot. This obliged them to haul to leeward, and land for the sake of performing the funeral rites which could alone insure the peace of the drowned mariner in the other world. The wind coming out from the south, the Spartan fleet was detained here some days, but finally succeeded in weathering Cape Malea, and the snowy peaks of Taygetus were once more faintly descried in the northwest. Glad were the hearts of all at the sight of the austere cliffs of Laconia; tumultuous were the emotions of Helen as she gazed again on the land of her birth, and thought upon all the events that had come to pass, and in which she had borne a part, since she had sailed away from thence with Paris. But the home-yearning wanderers were not destined to land there yet, for another tempest drove them far to the south, until the mouths of the Nile pouring out their tawny flood, and the low, yellow<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC5784-00000164"/> low shores of Egypt hove in sight, and groves of palm delicately penciled against the ever cloudless sky. There, grimed with the rime of the salt seas, and weary with watching the following surges and the misty stars, Menelaus and his queen with their exhausted crews sought rest. They moored first under the lee of the isle of Pharos, but afterwards glided up the Nile, by cities venerable and majestic, and pyramids watching the slowly encroaching sand-tides of the desert, until they reached the hundred-gated Thebes, with its avenues of sphinxes, its colonnades of stupendous colossi, and its eternal palaces and tombs. There, welcomed and feasted by the king of that mysterious realm, they tarried many days, until refreshed and once more seized by a longing for home. Then the voyagers manned their galleys again, and, loaded with precious gifts presented by their royal host, made sail for Hellas. This time the winds were propitious, and at last Menelaus and his wife reached their kingdom, and were greeted with great rejoicings by their subjects, who had long since given them up for lost. Hermione stood at the palace gate to welcome her parents on their arrival, but Helen knew not the tall, slender, and fair-haired maiden, dawning into womanhood; nor did Menelaus, when he alighted<pb n=""/> from his mule, recognize in her who came up and reverently saluted him, the little child he had left in the nurse's arms. When he learned that she was indeed his daughter, he realized how long and many had been the years that had been wasted in exile on the dreary plains of melancholy Troy.</p> 
               <p>Here, without further incident of moment to disturb the tranquillity of his reign, Menelaus passed the remaining years of his life, dealing out even-handed justice to his subjects, following the chase in the thickets of Taygetus, and royally banqueting his guests, among whom happened Telemachus, who came to Sparta in quest of his father, Ulysses. And the good king again enjoyed the society of Helen his wife, restored to him after such arduous pursuit. Putting away from his mind the events which had separated them so long, he treated her with honor and respect, and she dwelt with him quietly and with content, rejoicing in the company of her daughter, until Orestes, the cousin of Hermione and successor to Agamemnon, stole the heart of the royal maiden. In answer to his suit, her parents granted her to him with right noble espousals, and then Hermione bade farewell to the home of her youth, and rode away with her young king to Mycen.</p> 
               <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC5784-00000165"/> 
               <p>During the tranquil years succeeding her restoration to Sparta, Helen was doubtless at times a prey to regret and remorse which no optimism or reasoning could altogether banish; for she was a woman possessed naturally of tender sympathies, and sharing sentiments of humanity common to all. But the tremendous character of the crowding events which had followed from her flight to Troy was so overpowering as almost to swallow up her own individual agency out of sight, and to make her forget that she together with Paris had been the origin and source of all these calamities. The clamors of self-accusation were also stifled in her bosom by the reflection that Destiny, the arbiter of the lives of feeble mortals, had in a measure been the author of the manifold crimes and misfortunes which had cursed her, and all with whom she had been connected. Had not Destiny given to her the extraordinary beauty which had entangled her in a maze of difficulties? was it not Destiny that gave her passions and desires that clamored for gratification? was it not Destiny that stimulated Paris to search for her, and to disturb the tranquillity of her life, that afterward impelled him to hinder her return to Sparta, that brought on a disastrous war, and that subsequently inclined Priam to detain her in Troy<pb n=""/> when she would gladly have put an end to hostilities by voluntarily rejoining Menelaus? was it not Destiny that rendered the warnings of Cassandra abortive, and made Helen the instrument of such ruin? Wherein was she worse than other women of inferior charms, of less inflammable temperament, of lower station, who pass their uneventful lives virtuously and with injury to none, because Fate has endowed them with humbler and more controllable characteristics, and given them a lot free from great temptations and responsibilities. O mysterious problem of human existence, who shall say where responsibility for our actions begins and where it ends! Perpetually forced through life to choose between the right and the wrong; never free from the inflexible obligation of choice; and yet so constituted that the present with its good and its evil seems paramount, the future with its possibilities distant, indistinct, and uncertain, and difficult of realization, so that it is hard to choose fitly; perpetually struggling with the baffling infirmities of our own physical and mental natures, and evermore subject to the sway of shifting and apparently arbitrary circumstances, who shall say where begins, where ends the accountability for which the individual must answer before the tribunal of the other world.</p> 
               <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC5784-00000166"/> 
               <p>Thus reasoning in her mind, perchance sophistically,-who shall decide,-and flattering herself into self-justification, Helen lapsed naturally into the repossession of her former title and station at Sparta, gratefully accepting the soothing transition from war and violence and sea-voyaging to the quiet resumption of royal and domestic duties. She returned to the discharge of her avocations as wife, mother, and queen calmly, as if nothing had ever disturbed the current of her life, as if there were nothing further to apprehend.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <head>XIX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">NEMESIS.</head> 
               <p>THE day came at last, when the people looked grave in Sparta, and collected in the city gates, and at the corners of the streets, shaking their heads with dismay, for King Menelaus lay a-dying, and there was none who could avail to lengthen his days when Atropos severed the thread of his life. After the old warrior was dead, they bore him to Therapn and buried him in a tomb near the temple which he had erected there. Helen now reigned, sad and alone, over the kingdom of her fathers; but the Fates decreed that she who had wrought such ill in the world should not end her days in peace. Two young men, the sons whom a slave woman had borne to Menelaus before his marriage with Helen, being instigated by turbulent and unlawful ambition, now conspired to obtain for themselves the throne of Laconia. They found enough restless spirits like themselves willing to aid in the plot, and Helen soon saw herself not<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC5784-00000167"/> only without a husband, but also stripped of all her hereditary rights and possessions.</p> 
               <p>Not satisfied with their success, the usurpers incited the people to persecute the desolate queen, and the women who had lost their husbands and sons in the Trojan war were only too willing to accept the opportunity of assailing her with taunts and curses; the very children in the streets followed her with gibes when she bore her water jar to the well, and even the dogs took the trick from their masters and snapped at her skirts. It was awful to be thus abused in the city of her birth, the capital over which she had reigned,she the most famous woman of the world for beauty and for the power of her fascinations; she who had betrayed a nation to regain the throne from which she was now driven with insult and scorn, and forced to search for a resting-place for her head. But the spirit of Helen was too high, her soul too proud, to condescend to lay violent, hands on herself, and thus gratify the malice of her tormentors. Only by the white hairs that now began to tinge the raven hue of her still luxuriant tresses, did this discrowned yet haughty and unyielding queen betray the pangs that gnawed at her vitals.</p> 
               <p>However, another way there was for Helen to escape this humiliation; she could leave the<pb n=""/> country. But whither should she go? Was she likely to find any more favorable treatment in other parts of Greece? Hermione, her daughter, had just died,-so rumor had informed her; and hence no refuge was to be found at Mycen, had Helen been inclined to go thither. Fate directed the steps of the desolate woman. She overheard some men talking of a galley that was to sail from Gytheum in a few days on a trading cruise among the islands. Intuitively she apprehended that this was her opportunity, and for the coast she started, proceeding by slow stages, wearily and alone, over the rocky and solitary mountain paths,-not as she had before passed over this road, accompanied by a retinue of warriors devoted to her safety and comfort. At length the fragrance of the mountain thyme was lost in the smell of the salt sea, and soon she discerned the moveless blue line of the Mediterranean traversing the paler hues of the sky.</p> 
               <p>The shouting of shipmen preparing to put to sea easily guided Helen to the galley she sought. Very naturally they were loth at first to allow her a passage with them, but she produced, among other inducements, a golden bracelet which still adorned her arm, a relic of her former voyage. The rough skipper still demurred, half inclined to take the treasure from her by force without<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC5784-00000168"/> assenting to her petition; but he quailed before her searching eye and the majesty of her bearing, which no misfortunes could alter; he abstained from injury, and, his better genius prevailing, granted the request of the destitute queen. By this time the galley was yielding to the united efforts of the crew and sliding into the water, and Helen was afloat once more, to wander whither she knew not. There was no wind, and the mariners pulled monotonously at the oars, sometimes cheering the steady labor by singing with each stroke, "Repapay!" "Repapay!" So the vessel glided hour after hour down the gulf towards Cytherea's isle, reflected in the green, pellucid waiters, and attended by the white sea-fowl which hovered around so near that often the swift shadow of their wings darted with the effect of sudden light across the ship. But another form was following the galley, and a shadow darker than any that they discerned on that sunny day was cast on the face of one of those on board. The dusky shape of Nemesis was there, but invisible. We often tremble before what is seen; but the unseen is more than the seen in the mysterious life of man; more real, more terrible, and more difficult to escape.</p> 
               <p>But Helen lay on the after-deck near the helmsmen, leaning against the low bulwark, and<pb n=""/> gazing fixedly on the land she was leaving behind. As the nearer shore receded and grew dim, the more distant but far loftier range of Taygetus behind it arose to view, as if to remind her of the city which lay in the plain at its feet, where the innocent days of her childhood were spent,-days so far back in the past, days whose simple and satisfying happiness could never, never return to give joy to the now sunless heart of the friendless woman who gazed so intensely and for the last time on the fading cliffs of her native land.</p> 
               <p>Many were the ports where the galley touched, but at none of them would Helen tarry. She must go further, she said, and the crew, unconsciously impelled by the dictates of Fate, permitted her to remain on board until they should reach the final point of the ship's destination. There is an island off the coast of Caria called Rhodes; fair are its valleys, lovely are its groves, and the breezes that blow from its shores are laden with the perfume of the roses which give the isle its name, so great is their beauty and perennial abundance. And there Helen landed to take up her abode for the remainder of life. But people die at Rhodes as well as elsewhere.</p> 
               <p>Her presence was still noble, in spite of age and sorrow, and in her eyes still beamed a spark of the flame which had set the world on<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC5784-00000169"/> fire. The ruler of the little town where she landed extended a shelter to the woman whose adventures were known to all, and the news of whose arrival created no little stir on the island.</p> 
               <p>Some days passed, and nothing occurred to disturb the hopes of Helen that in Rhodes she might dwell unmolested for the brief remainder of life. But on the seventh night, by the dim light burning in her apartment, she saw Paris silently appear before her. It was not the god-like hero with whom she had fled from Sparta whom she now beheld. But his face wore an ashen pallor, a Stygian hue was on his lips, and a ghastly wound yawned in his breast. He said not a word, but in his eyes, whose gaze was steadily fixed upon her, dwelt an expression of deep, unutterable sorrow and concern, as if he still yearned over the woman for love of whom he had fought and died, and, in spite of the decay of her love for him, now mourned with profound despair over the adversities which at the last had overwhelmed her,-as if he saw the inevitable doom approaching and would shelter her beloved head from all harm, but could not. With a cry of anguish, the forsaken queen sprung toward the phantom of her lost lover and strove to clasp him in her arms, but the impalpable spectre eluded her embrace and vanished like thin smoke.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Scarce had Helen recovered from the shock she had sustained by the entrance of this apparition when another form glided into the room and stood by the foot of her couch. He was pierced with many sword-thrusts, and his lustreless eyes looked through her very soul with a cold, stern, penetrating gaze of reproach and retribution. It was Deiphobus. From his blood-stained lips escaped in hollow tone the solemn word, "To-morrow!" and then he passed from sight.</p> 
               <p>But now a third shade arose: a broad brow scarred and bald, eyes marked at the corners with lines of age and much trouble, a long white beard dabbled with clots of gore, and a tall and venerable form slightly bent with years and seamed with the red scars made by the murderer's brand. It was Priam. The pleasant look which had once beamed in his kindly eyes was gone: untold horror was there instead. With a warning gesture and in sepulchral accents, the spirit of the slaughtered king uttered these words of fearful portent: "To-morrow, Helen, daughter of Tyndarus,-to-morrow I summon thee to answer for the ruin of my house and the destruction of Troy!"</p> 
               <p>Shuddering violently, and cold with creeping terror, the miserable woman fell back in a swoon.<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC5784-00000170"/> The sun was shining across the threshold and the birds were twittering on the roof when she awoke to her senses again. She arose, composed herself, and passed out to bathe her face at the neighboring spring; a burnished shield of brass hung on the wall, smitten by the sun, and as she moved before it, she saw that her hair, which had still been almost black on the previous evening, had in one night become white as driven snow.</p> 
               <p>Polyxo, who reigned at this time over Rhodes, was the widow of king Tlepolemus, who had lost his life fighting in the Greek host at the siege of Troy. Long had his wife waited for his return, and great was her grief when the remnant of his shattered fleet came back from the Troad, leaving their chief dead on the plains of Ilium. But one day after she had mourned for him many years, it was told her that a woman had landed on the island, who from her stately bearing must have seen better days, and it was said that she was none other than Helen of Sparta, who had fled with Paris to Troy, and thereby brought destruction on myriads of brave men and innocent women and children. These tidings stirred the heart of Polyxo to its depths. Might she not now have some revenge for the loss of her husband, and at the same time wreak retribution for all<pb n=""/> who had suffered by the crime of this wanton stranger? So she reasoned with herself until she became frenzied as a bacchante, and in her madness ordered a number of her slave women to disguise themselves as Furies and slay the author of all these woes; nor did they shrink from the deed, for some of them, now withered with age, had also lost their friends in the Trojan war.</p> 
               <p>Ignorant of the designs of Queen Polyxo, but prepared for the doom which she was too well aware awaited her ere the sun should go down, Helen calmly repaired to the sea-side, and seated herself under a cliff on the sand. Long she mused there alone, gazing across the water in the direction of the land she so tenderly loved, but which she was never more to behold. Her thoughts were busied wandering over the past, recalling the events of her tumultuous career, and pondering the near approach of its termination. The sound of many feet drawing rapidly to the spot where she was seated, aroused Helen to a consciousness that her time was come. She arose, and with unaltered countenance and mien faced the company of raving women, who were now within a few paces of their victim, but who stopped suddenly, awed by her calm and majestic aspect.</p> 
               <p>"What do ye desire, and what hath affrighted<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC5784-00000171"/> your timid souls?" Helen said to them at length with scorn.</p> 
               <p>"Polyxo hath sent us," cried the women with clamorous tongues,-"she that was the spouse of Tlepolemus who was slain at Troy; she it is who now hath ordered us to wreak on you <choice>
                     <sic>vengence</sic>
                     <corr>vengeance</corr>
                  </choice> for the loss of her husband."</p> 
               <p>"Is it indeed so? then execute her will," replied Helen; "but indeed I owe her thanks for this. The Fates have stripped me of all that makes life sweet; my beauty, my husband, my child, my friends, my kingdom, are taken from me; I am an old woman, desolate and alone, but still of nobler descent than any woman that lives, and I shall leave behind me an imperishable name: 'tis well, then, that a queen takes an interest in my destiny, and occupies herself with carrying out the will of the gods concerning Helen of Sparta. Delay no longer to execute what ye are delegated to perform."</p> 
               <p>But it needed not these final words to urge the women to their deed of cruelty, for the demon of revenge possessed them once more. In their simulated character of Furies, with unkempt locks, screaming and foaming at the mouth, they rushed tumultuously forward, and seized Helen with the utmost violence. Tearing the garments from her person, they dashed her<pb n=""/> to the earth and passed a noose around the small, fair neck which lovers had so often fondled and kissed. Having accomplished their fearful purpose, the women retired, leaving the naked corse alone on the shore, where the ripples came up and laved the lifeless limbs, still white and polished as ever, but cold as if carved of Parian marble.</p> 
               <p>But when the islanders heard that Helen had been murdered, and that her body had been left exposed on the beach, they said that it was impious to refuse to a person of such note and importance funeral rites that would be accorded to the meanest hind. A number of worthy men accordingly went down to the shore, to obtain the remains of the Spartan queen, and honor them with the rites that would give her soul repose in the world of shades. But they found not what they sought, for a strong wind had blown all night, and hurled enormous breakers against the cliffs, and the undertow of the surf had carried the corpse of Helen out to sea, to wander, tossed from billow to billow, over the gray waste of waters, and find no resting-place.</p> 
               <p>A temple was afterwards erected on the brow of the steep overlooking the spot where the queen of Sparta had been slain, to serve both as a cenotaph and as a shrine where incense and sacrifices<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC5784-00000172"/> fices might be offered up to her memory. On the pediment were inscribed the words, "To Helen, the daughter of Tyndarus, the Rhodians have dedicated this monument, in remembrance of her beauty and in expiation of her untimely fate."</p>

            <head>NOTES.</head> 
            <p>Page 1.-IN a former work,-"The Turk and the Greek,"-the author attempted in some degree to accommodate Greek and Turkish proper names more to their actual pronunciation than obtains in the accepted orthography of such words. Of course only an approximate correctness can be obtained with the letters and pronunciation of a tongue so opposite as the English; but even that is preferable to the uniformly incorrect mode in which such appellatives are now rendered; and those writers who are introducing a style nearer to the original are deserving of credit for their meritorious but necessarily imperfect efforts. But so stamped, as it were, into all our literature are the forms borrowed by us from the Romans, that the pleasing associations with which they are invested in our minds from our earliest reading make it difficult to alter and spell them after an entirely different principle without producing a shock which jars on the continuous interest of the reader. Therefore, contrary to his own preferences, the author has in a work of this character considered it best not to deviate from the established usage in this matter. The Roman names of the gods have also, for the same reason, been retained, with a few exceptions in which the Greek word seemed on the whole preferable.</p> 
            <p>Page 60.-A circumstance similar to the rescue of the Greek mariner by a horse, occurred at the Cape of Good Hope, by which several lives were saved.</p> 
            <p>Page 79.-"The principal produce of Man is quails and Frank figs." So says one of the rude poets of modern Laconia<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC5784-00000174"/> conia in his simple lay. Frank figs are prickly-pears, the fruit of the cactus, which finds a congenial soil and grows to great perfection among the rocks of Cape Matapan, or the Land of Evil Counsel, as the district is sometimes called; and a really delicious fruit it is when eaten fresh and of the quality it attains there; some prefer it to the fig.</p> 
            <p>The quails of Man belong to the genus <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Coturnis communis,</foreign> slightly differing from the American quail. Towards the last of August and in September, immense swarms of these birds come across the sea from Africa; on reaching Man, exhausted by their long flight, they are unable to resist the force of the north wind, and as they fly low, fall to the ground and are easily taken alive by the natives, who pickle them, and thus obtain a staple article of diet for the greater part of the year. But in such vast numbers do the quails come, that the Maniotes not only secure enough to supply their own wants, but also export them both pickled and alive, by the million, to Athens, Smyrna, Constantinople, and elsewhere. Although this feathered phenomenon is chiefly confined to Man, it sometimes occurs in other parts of the Levant in more or less degree. I have seen quails blown to the ground in Trebizond on the Black Sea. Those commentators who are disposed to doubt the apparently miraculous fall of quails recorded in Numbers xi. 31, or to substitute locusts for quails in that passage, may rest assured that the prodigy there described is neither incredible nor improbable.</p> 
            <p>Page 101.-The game of dice, whose discovery is here ascribed to Palamedes, was in reality simply the cubes without the counters, which complete our game of backgammon. The name of a god was given to the different throws, of which the highest was very appropriately called Venus,-not an inapt symbol of the uncertainties which make up the lives of men, love being of the most value, but still, like the other phases of life, subject, apparently, to chances. To Palamedes is also attributed the system of stationing sentinels around a camp or army.</p> 
            <p>Page 124.-This abstract of the legend of Iphigenia has<pb n=""/> been given with little variation as told in the masterly drama of Euripides.</p> 
            <p>Page 129.-Mr. Morris, in various passages of his admirable poem, "The Doom of King Acrisius," has alluded to the rise and fall of tides in the gean. It is a little strange that with the ample information concerning the Mediterranean now so general among the well-informed, he should have committed this singular error. Many will remember the line in Byron's magnificent poem, "The Siege of Corinth,"- <q>
                  <l>"There shrinks no ebb in that tideless sea,"-</l>
               </q> and the note appended, "the reader needs hardly be reminded that there are no perceptible tides in the Mediterranean."</p> 
            <p>To one who has been reared on the shores of that "tideless sea" the first sight of an ocean-tide is strange indeed, an effect mysterious, yet unpleasing, as compared with the immobility of the Mediterranean, evermore having the same mark on the sand or the rocks from age to age, a type of the calm, unchanging character of the people who dwell in the gleam of its moveless blue; while the restless tides of the ocean, ever going and returning, ever hurrying to and fro, seem like the uneasy nations whose shores they lash.</p> 
            <p>Page 220.-The invulnerable nature attributed to Achilles is a post-Homeric addition to the legend. Nothing in the "Iliad" indicates that he was in this respect different from other men, but the reverse, as is implied, among other circumstances, by the necessity of providing him with a matchless panoply, which would have been clearly useless to one who was proof against harm.</p> 
            <p>Page 224.-No particular classic measure has been attempted in the song of Helen, but only such a form of blank verse as would in English convey the best notion of a corresponding metre in the Greek.</p> 
            <p>Page 153.-It is a natural inference from the passages in the "Iliad" relating to Chryseis and her father, that Chryses repaired to the presence of Agamemnon very soon after the<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC5784-00000175"/> capture of his daughter; but such is not distinctly stated to be the fact, and if Homer intended to convey that impression he forgot that it was impossible. For but three weeks after the events described in the First Book of the "Iliad," where Chryseis or Astynome is said to have been taken at the storming of Theb, Homer narrates in the Sixth Book the interview of Hector and Andromache, when she alludes in unmistakable terms to the fate of Theb, <emph>after</emph> which calamity she was espoused to Hector; and in the intervening time a son, Astyanax, had been born to them, then old enough to be frightened by the gleaming of a helmet, and therefore about six months of age, if of average intelligence. It is clear that from the time of the capture of Theb and the escape of Andromache,-evidently towards the ninth year of the siege, for the fall of Troy did not immediately succeed the death of Hector, the closing event of the "Iliad,"-at least fourteen or fifteen months must have elapsed. Therefore, since the action of the "Iliad" occupies but fifty-seven days, we are left to choose between two alternatives: either Chryses did not visit the Greek camp until some time after the loss of his daughter; or the interval between his expulsion and the occurrence of the pestilence was of duration long enough to account for the period which intervened between the fall of Theb and the marriage of Andromache, and the birth and six months' subsequent growth of her son. It has been thought fit in this work to harmonize the discrepancy by fixing the coming of Chryses "several months" after the fall of Theb, and leaving the period intervening before the epidemic came an algebraic quantity. The pestilence raged for nine days after it began.</p> 
            <p>Page 274.-The horse, if of size sufficient to overtop the walls of Troy and accommodate a score of men, must have had a body or barrel. as large as the hull of a craft of four or five tons, with other dimensions in proportion. Those familiar with the peculiar custom Americans have of moving their dwellings, tortoise-like, from one part of a town to another, and have seen a house thus on its travels, are aware that its motion<pb n=""/> is not so slow as a snail nor so rapid as a locomotive, and will readily perceive that the advance of such an unwieldy bulk as the Palladian horse must have been very similar, over the roadless plain of Troy. Three days have therefore been assigned to the removal of the horse, which is full as long as a large fleet like that of the Greeks could venture to lie in an open roadstead in winter, but is the very least space in which a mass like the horse could be drawn into Troy from the sea-shore; but the enthusiasm of the Trojan populace is to be considered as adding a certain increase of motive power, which would enable them to accomplish the enterprise in that time. Of course it is impossible to ascertain the exact distance traversed by the horse, because its precise location in the camp is unknown, and because alluvial deposits have extended the beach on which the Greeks were stationed during the siege beyond its original limits. But after making all due allowances, the distance in question may be set down as about three miles.</p> 
            <p>Page 278.-"I never heard the old song of 'Percie and Douglas,' that I found not my heart moved more than with a trumpet; and yet it is sung by some blind old crowder, with no rougher voice than rude style." So says Sir Philip Sidney, in his "Defence of Poesy," honestly confessing the impression made even on his cultivated mind by strolling minstrels. There is no doubt that few men have exerted a greater influence in all ages than the wandering singers or bards, who, if they no longer sing the "Chevy Chase" in England, or fire the Lacedmonian warriors to victory with Tyrtan strophes, still chant their humble ballads in plaintive, monotonous strains by the tent-door of the desert, in the coffee-shop of Asia Minor, or among the hamlets of the Isles of Greece. Not rarely have I heard blind beggars led by shock-headed, olive-colored urchins, singing exactly as I imagine Homer sang for a living three thousand years ago. But alas! there are no Homers among them now, and if there were, what would it avail?</p>

            <p>Some commentators have gratuitously assumed, in face of the fact that the word <foreign xml:lang="GRC"/>, "drug," is in apposition with the word nepenthe, that the nepenthe mentioned in the above passage was merely the soothing influence of Helen's agreeable conversation. The burden of the proof is with those raising the quibble. It is sufficient, in opposition to this, if indeed so clear a passage requires argument, to allude to the interchange of wares between Greece and Syria and Egypt, where the magicians and sorcerers and the priesthood had an early knowledge of the properties of many drugs, and to the fact that Helen herself had been in Egypt, where, as distinctly stated further on in the above passage, she had obtained knowledge of a variety of narcotics. It matters not to us whether nepenthe was bhang or opium; it is enough for our purpose that it operated as a soporific.</p> 
            <p>Page 326.-"Repapay." This word has been spelled as nearly as possible in accordance with its modern Greek pronunciation, rather than by the ruling orthographic canons. It is the cry of the Greek sailors of antiquity answering to our "Heave Ho!" The writer has heard a cry corresponding to it, repeated simultaneously with each stroke of the oars, by men pulling at the large launches of the Archipelago, called "Trattas," often in former years employed by the islanders to make piratical descents on ships becalmed off the coast, and still in occasional use for that purpose.  <foreign xml:lang="GRC"> </foreign>, according to Aristophanes, was a familiar way of terming a ship's crew, somewhat as we say "starbowlines," for the starboard watch, and the like.</p>
