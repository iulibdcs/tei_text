CHAPTER  "TAKE Boston, for instance." Convert the Capitol into a capaciou* farm-house, erected at four different periods; a part three-storied, a part two. a part one-and-a-half, and the rest one; a part of brick, and a part of wood, painted white; with green window-blinds and black sashes. Curtail the colonnade, and place a black wooden balcony about the sash- doors of the north wing, and you have Colonel Ambrose's house. Select from the Senate that gentleman wit, a tall, erect, commanding figure, broad, high forehead ;-perhaps he wears hat, coat, pants and all, "considerably the worse for wear;" perhaps he tied his cravat care- lessly on one side; perhaps forgot, or neglected to exchange his morning slippers for boots; and so exhibits to you one blue, and, one Scotch-gray stocking. You may know him by this. He has just the look above his lip and eye which makes you expect him to snap his finger at you, as he sees you criticising his dress, and to say, good-humoredly, "A man's a man, for a' that." Take him for Colonel Ambrose. Then take the rest of the legislative body-true, 't would be an oda metamorphosis-but take them; convert them into a family, consisting of a dignified, mild, intelligent lady, at-fifty; a studious young man, of great promise, at twenty three; a fair, romantic girl, at twenty; a de.- lightful romp, of eighteen; a dutiful, pleasant, and withal, wise lad, of seventeen; and some two, three, or four others, in the shape of help, and you have Mrs. Ambrose, Henry, Caroline, Jane, Frederic-and James Kent, and Alice Wood, &amp;c. &amp;c. Remove State-street entirely. Let the Common-abridged of one-half its proportions-extend from the colonnade. Fill it, about the house, with flowers in full and splendid -variety.

And please, sirs-indeed, my dear madams, do not remove the pond and conservatory. You will need them; the former, to make the prettiest little pond, and the prettiest brook, you ever saw; and the latter will do, with certain abridgments and corrections, for a summer-house. Nestle it down among the trees and flowers, close by the merriest part of the brook; and sirs, and madams, you have Colonel Ambrose's yard. Take as much of Boston as is necessary to make a farm of one or two hundred acres; a pretty, little, neat, country village; and use the rest for "rural sights and rural sounds." Take a strip of Massachusetts Bay for the Merrimac; and place it just where we may see it bounding and sparkling through the trees. Turn Park-street into a broad, winding avenue, lined with elms; Tremont-street, into " the main road," and you have Colonel Ambrose's farm and vicinage. It was just such a spot as every one admires. The rich, fat, city aris- tocrat, as he passed on his way to certain rich relatives at the north, thought of Bracebridge Hall; and wished that his party had a young Bracebridge among its inclusives, or that his valise held letters of intro. duction from Governor Davis, Edward Everett, or Daniel Webster. The poet, the painter, the antiquarian, the dilettante, and the travelled heir, in quest of adventure and " hair breadth 'scapes," at the hills or the lake, involuntarily loitered as they passed and looked, pqrhaps up, to see if there were no Flora or Clementina, waving scarf or kerchief at them from turreted towers; perhaps through the shrubbery, expecting to see a white-robed Isabella or Rebecca, training flowers. And they found themselves wishing for the olden time, when, as minstrel, artist, friar, or knight, they might have claimed hospitalities. If it was "at evening time," they saw light dresses through the trees; or they heard the merriest laugh in the world, or a fine-toned piano, ac- companied by fine-toned voices; and, perhaps, they saw strong lights through the crimson curtains of many windows: Then they gave up their original intention of travelling a few miles farther in the pleasant twilight, and drew up to the "Temperance House." They inquired of "' mine host," Who owned the large pleasant residence at the entrance of the village? and were convinced by his manner of pronouncing "Colonel Ambrose," that their interests were not misplaced. They ordered re- freshments; and while the cloth was being laid, strolled about the colonel's grounds. Supper waited for them long. Meanwhile, the poet had framed a long pastoral, and determined on sporting allusions to Hesperides, Tantalus, and Mrs. Hemans's "Stricken deer Dying of thirst, and all the waters near,"   THE EASTERN STATES.            9 and all such things. The painter had planned a rich twilight scene; the antiquarian, by some means, had gained access to the colonel's cabinet of Indian relics; the dilettante had compared our country with every other on the globe, and reached the conclusion, that ours " is to be" the very best and happiest, when gold shall no longer be sought and, loved as gold, but as a means of cultivating and promoting the fine arts; and the heir had fallen in love with Jane's voice.  The aged and care worn mendicant, wandered on a weary way, often prompted by the gnawings of hunger and the weight of fatigue, to seek a shelter for the night. He halted before many a house, perhaps bent his steps toward many a door; but sick at heart, he tottered on, dreading to meet the proud repulse or unfeeling reproof. At Colonel Ambrose's, the broad avenue, the open entrance to the yard, and the well-trodden paths, all said " come." His eye fell on the decayed oaks: the song of thy night breezes came from their branches. It fell on his dull ear--it was come; and it was a thrill of hope and trust, that went to the old man's heart; that quickened his step; that made him stumble in his eagerness, as he mounted the steps leading to the colonnade. To Colonel Ambrose and his wife, home was a sacred spot. It held the ashes of their parents; and their own would soon be resigned to its trust. They could not turn to a spot, around which thrilling memories did not cluster. They might be pleasant, they might be mournful; but they were alike precious. "And to tear myself from them," said Mr. Ambrose, when importuned to join an emigrating party, "would be to snap every pleasant cord of existence." Henry loved home for its quiet seclusion. Carolirn altd:lired its ro- mance, and a certain sort of grandeur that it wi e. Un,', r the necro. mancies of her ideality, the house was an irregular old castle, abbey, oJ something of that sort; the brook, a moat; the grove, a park, et cetera. Jane liked home as a matter of course; she loved everything beau- tiful and good: and as almost all things-in their last analysis-came under one of these epithets, there were few persons, or things, for which she had not pleasant places in her heart. Frederic thought most of the conveniences of the house and its append. ages; of the richness and durability of the soil; and of the admirable location of the whole, in points of trade, society, religious and literary privileges. And if you had asked James and Alice why they liked so well, they never would have been done wondering at the blind folly of your question. *,  .  ..     ."    <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6890-00000004"/> 10      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN CHAPTER II. EDWARD HALE, the father of Mrs. Ambrose, was what we, in the coun- try, call a wealthy trader. At the time of which we would treat, his wealth consisted of an amiable and intelligent wife; a lovely daughter of ten; a large, substantial brick block, occupied as family dwelling and store; and two or three thousands in various lucrative deposites. His large and beautiful garden was separated from that of Mr. Ambrose- father of our friend the colonel-by a slight and tasteful palisade. The vines that scrambled up on each side, and lidked their tendrils at the top, were not more closely united than were the hearts of these two families. Ambrose and Hale were members of the legislature-the former of the Senate, and the latter of the House. One Saturday, in time of session, they were accompanied home by several members from distant parts of the State. The day had been excessively warm; but it was followed by an evening of rare loveliness. "What a sweet evening! How strong this cool air makes me feel!" said Mrs. Hale. She was leaning on her husband's arm; and, accom- panied by Hutton of Kame, Gale of Hanover, and their little daughter, they were threading the garden paths to Mr. Ambrose's. "It was so sultry yesterday and last evening, that I really fancied myself quite an invalid, and confined myself to my room." "I thought you had been ill-more so than usual, Fanny," said Mr. Hale, fixing his eyes with tender earnestness on her face; " are you really better, or is this a benevolent artifice to keep me at ease?" "Oh! my indisposition was the slightest thing in the world-owing, I am convinced, to the temperature. I feel more of health about me to- night than I have for days, even weeks. Just see, gentlemen, where the sun is setting!" "Most magnificent!" said Mr. Gale; and he fixed his eyes a moment where the sun was "making a golden set." "But, now, Mrs. Hale, pray don't talk of'atmospheric influences. You know the et cetera of Moore's: 'T was that friends, the beloved of my bosom, were near;' and of Cowper's:  It is content of heart Gives nature power to please.' I see you anticipate my id est-your husband is near you to-night." Mrs. Hale laughed and blushed. "Sagacious in such matters, for a bachelor," said Mr. Hutton. "Sagacious, Mr. Hutton!" said Mrs. Hale, still laughing; "then you think his saucy imputation correct?"   THE EASTERN STATES.            " "Why, yes, madam, and for this reason: you recollect Dr. 11am mond told us that to-day has been warmer than yesterday, by two de grees, according to Fahrenheit." "Good, on my honor! Now what can you say, Mrs. Hale?" "Why this, Mr. Gale, that he is my husband; and I do not care how much you think I love him, and pine for him when he is absent.' Mr. Iale smiled; then sighed, and pressed the hand of his wife more closely in his own. Mrs. Hale had been fading, day by day, for many months; yet so slowly, that her husband was seldom startled by his fears; but they had settled on his heart, a constant and most oppressive burden there. Especially when absent, whether in the crowded street, hotel, or senate-chamber, did memories of her gentle and patient suffer- ings, cause the lustre to go suddenly out from his eye, animation from his gesture, and ambition from his heart. Even then, whenther merry laugh was ringing in his ear, 'he found it impossible to rid himself of his newly. awakened apprehensions. Henry Ambrose saw them approaching the gate, and sprang forward to open it. "Fanny!" and "Henry!" exclaimed the children; and in an instant their hands were locked, and Henry was leading Fanny to his flower- plat. "Why, Fanny, I thought you would never come!" said he. "I have been watching here for you this hour; and my four-o'clocks that I wanted to show you so, are all shut up. But look-ah! stop, Fanny; here is a bush that will catch your frills and curls, and hold you fast, just as that blackberry-bush did, if you do n't let me hold it so, till you pass. There; now look at this Indian pink-is n't it a beauty?-and I have been saving it all day for you." All this time, little Fanny had been skipping and laughing, in her childish glee; but when Henry offered the pink, she held her hands and her breath in mute wonder and delight-the colqrs were so ridh, various and beautiful, and the fragrance so sweet. Mr. Gale said something about innocence, youth, flowers, and lovers in miniature; but his party did not understand what, for he had lagged in observing the young folks. In compliance withthe wishes of one of Mr. Ambrose's guests, the whole party followed a romantic path that led through a dense but nar- row wood, which then lay between Mr. Ambrose's house and the river, entirely shutting out the latter from the prospect. A sail-boat was fastened by a little wharf at the termination of the path, into which Mr. Gale jumped, followed by all the gentlemen of the party, except Hutton and Hale. "Esquire Hutton, there is a vacant seat for you. Excuse me, sirs, and I will return to the house with the ladies," said Mr. Hale,.offering. his arms to Mrs. Ambrose and his wife.    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6890-00000005"/> 12      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN "Indeed, indeed, Esquire Hale; please take the boat, and allow me to attend the ladies," said Mr. Hutton, laying his hand on Mr. Hale's shoulder; "I must be excused, for I have, for certain very painful reasons, a settled aversion to sailing." Mr. Hale yielded: he led his wife up a short ascent to the plain. ( I would rather accompany you," said he, slowly relinquishing her hand. ( Stay at Esquire Ambrose's, dear Fanny, until I return; it shall- be soon." He watched her until a turn in the path took her from his sight, and then turned languidly to theboat. "Just let me remind you, Hale, that you are not a lover," said the light-hearted Gale; "you have forgotten this, else you are perpetually imagining yourself in the honeymoon." Mr. Hale smiled a the gay sally of his friend, took an oar, and they darted down the stream. And here I would gladly close the scene; for it was horrible, in the dimness of late twilight, to hear the confused murmur of many, voices in the distance, to catch on'ly the cries of, "Drowned! drowned!-who?- where?-who drowned?-drowned!"-to see crowds of men, women, and children, at first, hurrying to and fro with lanterns, which only gave to horror. stricken visages a ghastliness more fearful than that of death; and then, all verging to one point, the scene of sudden and awful dis- solution; and to listen all the time for a name. "Esquire Hale and his visitor, Gale," said some one. Mr. Hale was universally beloved; and it was a cry of bitter agony with which scores in that crowd echoed ' Esquire Hale!" They seemed paralyzed, for an instant, and then rushed down the river path. They paused again; it was at a piercing shriek from Mrs. Hale. She was hurrying, with Mrs. Ambrose,.through the yard to the street, when she heard her husband's name. She stood a noment, with her eyeballs fixed, immovable, and senseless as a statue; then stretched out her arms, shrieked, and fell upon- Mrs. Ambrose's bosom in strong convulsions. This melancholy accident was caused by the romantic daring of Mr. Gale. They were sailing near the falls: "Please stop a moment," said Mr. Gale; "I can spring to thathigh rock, and from that, to that beauti- ful island." His party remonstrated; but, with a gay laugh, he bounded like a deer to the rock. Thence-to the island it was a fearful leap. His friends trembled for him, and well they might; for the next moment he disappeared in the water, among the rocks. Mr. Hale, utterly forgetful of self, in his benevolent purpose of saving his young friend, dashed into the stream, in the midst of the expostulations of his friends. They saw him pass into the rapids, and that was the last. They mounted different rocks, called, but no sound came except the deep roar of the waters. Mr. Ambrose acted with his usual promptitude, energy, and wisdom. He left all' of the party on the falls to watch, except one. With him he rowed with all   THE EASTERN STATES.            13 possible speed to the shore, for lights and assistance. It was his inten. tion to secure, first, means of saving his friends, and then to inform his wife what had happened, and leave her to break the intelligence to Mrs. Hale, in the best way she could. But it came to her in the' manner we have described. Mr. Ambrose heard her shriek as he was entering his yard. On ascertaining her situation, he returned to the crowd, found a physician, and urging him to go to the unhappy woman, he hurried to the falls. The bodies were found at last; but not until -too late for resuscitation. Mr. Hale's burial was on the fourth day. Mrs. Hale still remained at Mr. Ambrose's, in a constant delirium; hence it was judged neither safe nor desirable to remove her. She lingered two days after the burial of her husband, remaining unconscious until two hours before her death. She was impatient to be gone: her only requests were, that they would bury her in her husband's grave, and that her daughter might reside per- manently with the Ambroses. She tenderly kissed the weeping Fanny, pressed Mrs. Ambrose's hand in hers, thanked them for all they had done: "And now," said she, with a faint smile, as she closed her eyes, "and now, dear friends, let me think of Edward-of Heaven, and then die." At first, Fanny's heart was near breaking ; Master Henry could only take her in his arms, and weep with her. But her grief soon lost its in- tensity, and, at length, gave way to a melancholy, but cherished sort of regret. Mr. and Mrs. Ambrose, filled in her heart the place of her lost parents. Henry had always been her own dear playmate; and then he was with her always-in her pleasures, sorrows, play, work, study, and all. At the time our story opens, she had been thirty years his happv wife. She had been singularly blessed in all her relations, domestic and social; but she had never known a moment of that light-hearted joyous- ness, which rang out in \the laugh with which she met Henry, on the evening of her father's death. CHAPTER III. "THERE, 'papa, I can't write! As Jane would say, 'I have ransacked every nook and corner of my upper loft,' without mustering a single sen- sible idea. -I wrote once, and it was too formal; again, and it is too familiar. The idea that Miss Graham is a city belle-all ceremonial etiquette, doubtless-appals me." Caroline threw down her pen, and rose from the table, blushing as sh spoke. "Why, my daughter! I think, now, it might be the easiest thing in the world to invite Miss Graham to Franklin," said her father, looking up from papers he was examining. "I must look over these documents be- fore the mail goes out, else I would spare you the trouble. I wrote to     <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6890-00000006"/> "      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN  Mr. Graham on business-not more than a dozen lines; and just alluded to invitations that my daughter would extend to his: so you see there is  no escape." Mr. Ambrose smiled, and recommenced reading. Caroline said "Oh dear!" and again took her seat at the table. "And, sister, if you wish to write by rules epistolaire-they are not local, you know: what is etiquette at Boston, is etiquette here." Our little friend Jane said this. She sat beside her mother, fastening a rosette on the top of a brown silk night-cap, she was making for Henry;  and Mrs. Ambrose smiled at the renewed spirit with which she plied her . needle, as she spoke: "Jane, do you write;-and yet you will rattle so, she won't know what i to make of it. You may write, however, and then let us see whether it will do."  Jane answered with a nod, and a laugh; and in a moment she was  writing as fast as she could move her pen.  "But Jennie, my child, do n't write so fast," said Mrs. Ambrose.  "Ha! I must, mother; I am chasing forty funny ideas. Strange, Care, that you could n't think what to write." All this time, scratch, scratch, went Jane's pen. She laughed, clapped her hands when she concluded, and seated herself on a rug at Caroline's side, to read what'she had written. "You see, Caroline, I began decidedly in order-just as the preceptor commands; a comma after Franklin, a comma after May 20, and a period after 1841. And see; I have a ' Miss Ellenora Graham.' ' Phoe- bus!' Hal would say, 'what a name!' Apropos, 1 am afraid I shall be terribly distressed about a satisfactory abridgment of this same 'El- lenora.' From my heart I envy the man who can snap his fingers, say ( What's in a name?' and then go off whistling. Mamma, you did just right in marrying an 'Ambrose,' and dubbing me 'Jane;' I should not have been satisfied with anything else. Now, strangers call me ' Miss Am- brose;' and that sounds grand. My 'dear five hundred friends' say, ' Jane ;' and that is fine, and pretty. Those who love me, call me 'Jen- nie ; and that is sweet and jingling as the music of 'Carrye.' And, then, when I plague folks, it does them a great deal of good to call me 'Jin ;' do n't it, ' Care ' " Ha, yes; and if you would not have me call you 'Jin,' now, read lhat letter." Jane commenced reading-' My Dear Madam'-and then sprang to her feet, and with just the amusing tone, attitude, and gesticulation of a tivice in elocution, she said: ' Do n't view me with a critic's eye, But pass my imperfections by!'" "Come, Jennie; I shall be tempted to call you 'Jin,' and send you out of the room, if you do not behave better. I shall miss the mail."   THE EASTERN STATES.            15 Jane kissed her father's forehead, and commenced reading in an under- tone to Caroline. "' I have been duly elected family amanuensis, pro tempore. In this capacity, let me add our entreaties to the invitation preferred by my father, in his letter to Mr. Graham. "' There are a thousand reasons why you should come to Franklin at this time, my dear Miss Graham. The country is so pleasant, now the singing-time of birds has come once more! We have none of the " most pretty things" with which your city abounds, to offer; but we have broad green fields, pastures, and groves; pleasant streets and pretty by-roads, with what H. B. Stowe calls "strips of green ribbon" in them. And you will make us all so happy by coming; and sister Caroline hopes that you will assist her in making something of a certain wild creatuire that runs at large " about town," -y'clept Jane Ambrose. And I flatter myself, we can make your stay agreeable to you, Miss Graham. If you are a Minerva, in our study you will find books of every desirable character, from the musty, massy old tome of the classic, down to Dickens's last novel. Papa will discuss political and agricultural economy with you; mamma, domestic and moral science; Harry, when here, metaphysics, geneSal literature, and the arts; Caroline, poetry and romance; Frederic, natural science, and such things; and Hthere will be nothing left for me to do, but to love you. Then, there is a student of Dr. Baldwin's here often-I dare say you will like him vastly; Care does. But he is too abstruse, speculative, and-in a word, too Germanic, to suit me. I would as lief sit down in a ruined monastery, to read Youngs's "Night Thoughts," by moonlight, with no companions but bats and owls, as find myself fastened to him in a tete-a-tete. And there is another of the same water, clever as you can. well conceive-but so stiff! one would think him laced in covers of Cicero's "Orations," Homer's "Iliad," Virgil's "Elpeid," and XEschylus's "Prometheus Bound." "' If you are a Hebe, then you will be in your element. 'T is such a delightful place, they are such delightful people, that one meets with nothing but pleasure wherever one turns. We will sail with pleasant parties and charming music on the river, and drive in carriages and on horseback; ,You will be delighted with our beautiful roan-he is so playful and elegant. We will climb hills, and perhaps mountains; range highwaysi aniby-ways, in quest of minerals, flowers, and adventures. If inclined to be at all quixotic, we will chase butterflies and ignesfatui; and, Miss Graham, if we please, we will rake hay, ride on the capt, hunt hens' eggs, and'drive the cows, et id omne genus. "Though last, not least," we have a miniature lake, and a miniature skiff, so tiny and classical! You shall be "Lady of the Lake," if you please, and Hal shall be your James Fitz James.  "'But, dear Miss Graham, I must conclude. Esquire Gates, the bearer of this paper, is one of my father's most valued friends-" an honest man," "as all the world doth know." As papa doubtless stated, he will spend    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6890-00000007"/> 16      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN some cays in town,.and conduct you to us on his return-yourself permit. ting. Please do not disappoint us. Thus prayeth, for her household, 'Yours, in all sincerity and truth, 'JANE AMBROSE."' Caroline lifted both hands when she concluded, and said, "Why, Jane Ambrose!" Mrs. Ambrose looked at her husband, and he looked at her; then peeped over his spectacles at Jane, as she sat there busily sealing her letter. She looked at them all, then laughed at the ludicrous expression that sat on the countenance of each. At first, she could not tell whether her father felt most of disapprobation, wonder, or mirth. That the latter, at length, predominated, she knew; for he took their dispatches, and left the room with a hearty laugh. Messrs. Ambrose and Graham were chums at "old Hopkinton," during a year spent at that institution by Mr. Ambrose and Fanny. A very delightful intimacy sprang up, based as it was upon sameness in tastes, pursuits, cast of intellect and affection. They commenced a correspon-, dence on parting, which was kept up without intermission-changed, in- deed, in character; for mammoth sheets, filled with accounts of their "Ladye loves," their studies, travels, speculations, &amp;c. &amp;c., gave way at length to common sheets of letter paper, perhaps half filled with courteous inquiries, congratulations and wishes, a few general reflections on the politics, literature, and religion of the country-except when some great "schoolmaster was abroad," and they "compared notes" on causes and consequences. But the personal intercourse of the families had heretofore been restricted to a few brief interviews between Mr. Ambrose and Mr. Graham's family, when business called the former to the city. Fanny, too, had her favorite-what school girl has not?-a tall, splen. did, black-eyed girl from Virginia, as unlike Fanny in her style of beauty, manners, dress, and accomplishments, as can be well conceived. 'Twas like Hebe and Juno. Fanny laughed, played ball, cheered Martha when she was in the blues, assisted Joseline in the solution of a difficult problem, shaded a cavern for Mary and a torn rock for Ann, Wrought the most difficult parts of a basket of flowers on a piece of embroidery, that was to be Jane's chef d'oeuvre, and yet managed to be perfqct in her own exercises; but how or when she studied, painted, and embroidered, no one could tell. It was meet, then, that Fanny should wear her hair in long, careless ringlets, floating about her shoulders, throat, or face, just as happened; that she should wear no combs, but throw her curls into place by a toss of her head; no jewels, except one small, delicate ring; and that her dresses should be chintz or white muslin in summer, and bombasin or camlet in winter. But Martha Custis Washington Marshall -she was named for "Lady Washington,"--was, indeed, remotely allied to the Custis family, into which Mrs. Washington first married; and the   THE EASTERN STATES.            17 family pride of the Marshalls induced them to retain the name in christen- ing their only daughter-but Martha Custis Washington Marshall was never half Miss Marshall, unless in a rich silk, satin, or brocade. She disposed her, glossy black hair in massy folds and puffs, about her lofty, transparent forehead. She wore gold pins, gold buttons, gold buckles, gold bracelets, and gold rings. Fanny was best pleased when she wore them all at a time; for then, she said, there was " a corresponding con- struction throughout." Miss Marshall's intellect was of the highest order -masculine in its boldness and vigor; and her passions were of strong and burning activity. She loved Fanny intensely, To all others cold and ceremonious, to her only she yielded the " open sesame " to her sym- pathies, and all the warm and. generous feelings of her nature. So, while many envied and feared, only a few admired and respected her for her extraordinary beauty and talent: Fanny loved her as she would have loved a tender and very superior sister. They parted, on the Virginian's return home, with mutual regrets and mutual vows of eternal friendship. For a long time, they kept up a correspondence. Fanny wrote about her dear Harry, and Miss Marshall about falling in " love at first sight" 1ith a noble fellow, Frank Howard-then they were married; and as new loves and new cares gathered about them, interchanges became less fre- quent, and, at length, ceased entirely; not, however, until a son and a daughter had been added to the " household band " of each. CHAPTER    IV. "MR. BALDWIN! Hal! 't is pleasant as Eden out; and here you sit, immersed in musty books and musty Irnuscripts!" said Jane Ambrose, as, with her bonnet in her hand, she entered the room where her brother and Mr. Baldwin were sitting. "Everybody and everything is abroad but you," she continued-and she gathered up their books, and lodged them on the carpet under the table, as she spoke--" and I asked Dr. Bald- win about it, Harry; and he said he does not allow his pupils to study evenings. So let us take a long walk, I will bring Caroline and Fred; and go, both of you, and muster all the choice spirits in the village." "And the watchword shall be 'Jennie,'" said Mr. Baldwin, bowing low as he left the. room. "Ha! yes." "And the mustering-place?" inquired her brother. "Lanric rnead," answered Jane, with a laugh, and a sweeping cur tesy of the o4dest edition. In a few minutes, a large and happy group had gathered in Mr. Am. brose's piazza and yard.    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6890-00000008"/> 18      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN "How is it, Jane, that we always wait for Miss Pons?" inquired Sidney. "Why, she has taken the Lady's Book these last six months for her rule; so she sports a riding-dress, a promenade-dress and all, on the most trivial occasions, when one don't care at all what one wears. I should have no patience-it so effectually chills the ardor with which I love to enter sports of all kinds, to have anything to do but laugh and anticipate." "Yes; but pray, are we to be paired and squared in this walk, and then move on, ' with musing eye and even gait?" asked Sidney. "Oh, no; 't is to be one of those topsy-turvy affairs, of which you and I, and Miss Blanchard here, are so fond. I want to frighten Miss Pons and plague Mr. Baldwin. So, he is coming. Oh, dear! I have been getting out of his way ever since he came. Sid, if necessary, I am engaged to walk with you and Caroline; remember. He is so pe. dantic; his learning is really a disease." "And do you fear contagion?" said Sidney. "No, indeed; but-now see my woman's tact; 'twill furnish you witS another argument in support of your hypothesis. Mr. Baldwin, please approve our plan. It is, that this ramble of ours be sans ceremo. nie throughout:-I do so love extemporaneous things! If I were to write poetry, it should be all in extemporaneous couplets; if I ever fall in love, it shall be at first sight; and-but here comes Miss Pons, and, as I live, Mr. Gates and Miss Graham. We did not expect them till to-morrow." Mr. Ambrose walked down the avenue to meet them. Miss Graham had been leaning from the carriage, looking eagerly to the right and left, and then at the house. She sprang lightly to the ground when the colonel met them, and putting her arm through his, walked chatting and laughing to the house. "A beauty, is n't she, Sid?" said Jane. "Well for you, and for you. Mr. Baldwin, and for you, Hal,&amp;nd George, that the ' wayward boy, Don Cupid,' is ' purblind,' else the tale of each would soon be, ' he, too, had been hurt by the archers.'" "We did not expect you until to-morrow; and so our young people were preparing for a walk," said Mr. Ambrose, as they ascended the stone steps leading to the colonnade. "My daughter Caroline, Miss Graham--Miss Graham, Caroline." There were warm kisses and warm pressures of the hand; and Mr. Ambrose proceeded to introduce her to others. "Please, Mr. Ambrose, do not name your daughter Jane to me; but let me guess her out. 1 fancy that I know just what sort of a person. age would write just such a letter as I received from her. Besides, Mr. Ambrose, you said she is like her mother; and I have heard papa describe her a hundred times." All this time she had been looking about her; but Jane had concealed herself behind a column. "She is not here." said she, laying her hand on Mr. Ambrose's arm, as she turned to hiln *                         I   THE E  MSTERN STATES.          19 with a look of disappoirntment. Jane peeped round the pillar; their eyes met; and,lwith a laugh which Miss Pons declared she should never forget-it was so long, loud, and unfashionable-they sorang into each other's arms. CHAPTER V. Two weeks had passed by, and Jane and Miss Graham had found themselves, at different times, in a thousand modes of pleasant existence. "Them gals do act like all nater," said old Mr. Holt one day, when he came up from the field to his dinner. "The little nimble critters go over fences and walls like colts. And just to see them, this forenoon, clap their hands and laugh when they come upon a great patch of May- flowers, was enough to make me forget my rhbumatiz," "Yes, grandfather," interposed little Will-" yes; and what made it the funniest was, they didn't know that we were all staring at 'em; and that Ch irley, and Jont, and I were stuffing our mouths chock full of hands, jackets, or handkerchiefs, to keep the laugh back." "Yes," said Charley, laughing; "and then when that Boston girl fell down-gosh! I shall always laugh when I think of it. She went just like a cat, mother; was on her feet and running again before you could have said 'Jack Robinson.' Then, I tell ye, we could n't stand it any longer, and we burst all at once into a great, long, uproarous laugh." "And mother, and grandmother, and little Hatty," said the animated little Will, passing his plate for more pudding; " and then they jumped over the fence as quick as that, or as quick as that, poz!" suiting gestures' to his words, "and come to us,. and talked with us, and helped us drop corn an hour. The best of this is, mother, we shall finish two or three hours earlier for their help; and we can go to the mead or brook, and catch some of the fishes you love so since your appetite is so poor." \ "Oh, yes; and there is something else I've been keeping for the last, as you do your pie, and cake, and best victuals, mother," said Charley; "they are coming over to stay a long time with you and grandmother.' The grandmother was at table, but too deaf, from old age, to hear. So little Harrie:, or Hatty they all called her, tottered up to the old lady's side, caught her hand, her sleeve, and her neckerchief, by turns, with a nervous earnestness; and raising her voice as high as possible, said, "Gra'ma'm-you-Jennie toming see you." The old lady strained her dim eyes, and bent her dull ears closer to the child; but she could not understand her. "Bless her little heart!" exclaimed she, kissing the round rosy cheek of Harriet, and pressing her in her arms; "grandmother knows 't is something good." ,    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6890-00000009"/> 20      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN "Yes, grandma," said Will, raising his voice loud and shrill--" yes; she is telling you that Jennie Ambrose is coming over to see you." "Jennie? God bless her! for kind and good is she to the old, the sick, and the poor. She lets out her sweet voice so loud and clear; and she never tires talking with me, deaf as I am; and who would think, Sally, to see her with the young, when so fill of her fun and frolic- who would think then, that she would have such serious and sweet words of comfort for those that mourn? She can make me believe, almost any time, that it is a blessed thing to be poor. God bless her!" The good old lady's tears were streaming down her cheeks when she concluded. "There, Clement, just what you have been wanting: an illustration of the poetry, and beauty, age, and sublimity of motion," said Professor Bancroft to a pupil on whose arm he was leaning, on his way to the institution. Caroline, Miss Graham and Jane, were approaching them on their return from a morning ride on horseback. "I thought Miss Jane suf- ficiently daring, in mounting that roan she has made over to Miss Gra- ham; but this creature is a very Bucephalus. Jove"! see his step, his eye, and his neck. See Miss Jane: she sits with as much care and grace as if--"  He paused to bow, touch the brim of his hat, smile, and say "Good morning." As they passed a cottage, the poorest in the village, a motley trio came to the wjndow to observe them. There was a hard-looking woman of sixty, and her name was Hayes; her daughter, a tall, fragile-and despite her uncouth attire-singularly graceful and beautiful girl. of eighteen; and a dignified, pleasant gentleman of some twenty-five or thirty years, elegantly dressed in a long robe-de-chambre, collar and cravat decidedly a la Byron; although these last were not then, as now, exactly a la mode. It will be seen that this gentleman was Mr. Flanders, nephew of Mrs. Hayes's deceased husband. "I declare, I should think them creaters would break their necks," said Mrs. Hayes, as she made the hole in her check curtain a little larger, that she might see without being seen. "I won't indulge their pride, by letting them see me looking at them. Lor!-run Will!" she exclaimed, at a graceful and spirited gyration of Jane's steed. "Yet you need n't; no matter if she does get thrown off; she is old enough to know better.' As to Mr. Flanders, he heard not a word; but stood almost breathless with admiration, until the trio were out of sight. He drew a long breath as he turned from the window. "Beautiful!-beautiful as a picture! was n't it, aunt and cousin?" "Nonsense! now don't go to talk such stuff before Mari. She's full silly enough now, though I have been trying with all my might and strength these-these fourteen years, to make her like other folks." "Fourteen years, aunt?" said Mr. Flanders, looking down to Maria's pale and averted face. "You must have commenced instruction early.'   THE EASTERN STATES.            21 "Yes; when she was four. She showed then that she was different from everybody-and see there, Will!-if she ain't going to crycabout it, now! You silly creater, Mari! I can hardly keep my hands off of you. You 'll shed tears enough by the time you die, to drown the world, I was going to say." The poor girl bent her head still lower; but she did not conceal the tears that fell upon hpr work. "Just as true as you are alive, Will, she has always been just so- all laugh or cry. If things went just right, there was no living with her, without taming her right down ; and then, if 1 spoke to her, as other folks do to their young runs, she'd cry herself sick." Mr. Flanders nodded his head coldly to her remarks: Maria hurriedly left the room. The girl feared her mother just as she would have feared an avalanche, or any other thing that could crush her. She seldom ex- pressed an opinion, or gave vent to a feeling. She and Mrs. Haves had none in common; and hers never failed to draw upon her the coarse sarcasm, or ifl-natured rebuke of her unfeeling parent. She feared her cousin, because he was so stately, because he kn w so much, and her- self so little. He had been under their-roof three days. Meanwhile, Maria had not spoken in his presence beyond an extorted monosyllable; and she was quite sure she should venture no further, if he remained three years. That she was singular and foolish, beyond all precedent, she had no kind of doubt; for had not her mother told her so a thousand times? And to utter a single idea, she believed would be to incur the ridicule or disapprobation of her cousin. So, when he exhibited his portfolio of drawings and paintings, in the hope of drawing her out, she was a mere echo. If he called a piece pretty, she said " yes;" and when he said of an exquisite piece, executed by. himself---"There, this is liked; but I do n't think it so very nice, do you, cousin?" she answered ", no." He, at another time, drew his chair up to the table where Maria was sewing; and said, in a free and easy way, which he meant should put hdr timidity to flight-"Now, my good cousin, tell me about Franklin people and things. Have you pleasant people, and pleasant walks here?" Now Mrs. Hayes had always ridiculed Maria's passion for walking. Surely she had divulged this odd propensity to her cousin; and surely he was putting these questions in malice or insult. So thought Maria; and, frightened out of all self-control, she answered hastily that she knew nothing about it; and gathering up her work, she left the room in the most painful embarrassment imaginable. Of the people she, indeed, knew nothing-for they had been only three weeks in town; but of the walks -why, she had already found a dozen, all pleasant as Eden. There was one by the river. She liked that best at twilight, when shadows -were gathering thick and deep among the trees of the opposite bank; and when the reflections upon the stream, wore just the mistiness which helped her active imagination to find there semblances " of all glorious things." There was another, more frequented by her, because more retired" close 2    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6890-00000010"/> 22      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN by a tiny brook-that came laughing, sparkling, and dancing down a hill- side, back of her humble home; and yet another, along the irregular bor- ders of a beautiful little lake that glittered on the summit of the upland, back of the village, like a crown of diamonds and gold upon a monarch's brow. Maria went to her room, and sat down to gloomy and mortifying reveries; from which she was aroused, at length, by a call from the kitchen. "Mari!-come; the swill is ready for the pig; and I want you to carry some dough out to the hins. I guess the cropple-crown lays some- where; but I can't think where, unless 't is in a brace of the high beams on that straw. You 'd better get up and see; and if you find a neest " "But, mother, it makes me so dizzy to go so high." "Nonsense! As old as I am, I can walk on a high beam as well as on a floor, and I 'll venter you. If you do fall, mind and not break the eggs." And she did fall. She came limping back into the kitchen, and threw herself down in a chair near the door, scarcely able to stand from pain. "Where are the eggs, Mari? did you break the eggs?" "No, mother; but I fell and nearly broke my ancle." "Oh, that's all. Well, never mind; your bones are like a little young 'uns-as easily broke, and as easily mended." The woman concluded with an ill-natured chuckle, as she commenced reading'a paper, Maria instantly recognized, as the one on which she had written some original verses, one day, on returning from a walk on the hill. They were very legible, because written in a neat and correct im- itation of print-by the way, the only mode of penmanship to which Maria was accustomed; and this was self taught. Mrs. Hayes read: ' Flowers are springing, Birds are singing, From the lap and crown of May." "Ha, ha! well done! well done, Mari!  'The lap anid crown of May!' Sentimental, ain't it, Will?" Maria turned round, and there stood her cousin. Oh, dear! She wished her verses and herself, too, in the wilds of the West; as she thought for a moment, that she would rather lie down in her grave at once, where no more such grievances could reach her. She knew that they were slight, but they were constant; and they weighed down her spirits liim an incubus. She saw that her cousin was looking serious-she thougit rather fierce-and she doubted nothing that it was all in disapprobation of her folly. She begged he, mother to restore her papers, to no purpose. She grasped them the closer, and began to clear her throat for further reading. "Surely, aunt, you-"Mr. Flanders began; but Maria heard no more. She burst into tears, and ran to her room. She had just time to cry   THE EASTERN STATES.            23 herself into a violent headache, when her mother called her tsi her work.  "Ha! Mari! 'the lap and crown of May,"' said the unfeeling woman, when Maria entered the room, wholly unsoftened by traces of ner suffering, inflamed eyes and quivering lips. "Well, Seward has sent in this pile of shoes to be bound to day. 'T is a sight more 'n you've ever done in a day-but you must do 'em some way; for this forenoon I 've got to bake, and wash the floor, and churn; and this afternoon, I 'm going to meeting. Soak 'efh well-your fingers are so shiftless-no larger than a young 'un's. Strange! see mine:" and she thrust out her enormous brown digits, of twice the size and muscular strength of Ma. ria's. "Ilard work has madd them so," she continued, with a sort of pride; "but you are different from everybody. The harder you work, the smaller and whiter your 'n grow." So Maria sat down to her task. She had no appetite for her dinner, and dreading an interview with her cousin, she did not appear. Mr. Flanders dispatched his hastily, and in silence; and returned immediately to his room-study, he called it-to Mrs. Hayes's infinite amusement. Her little back bed room, with its stark, unpainted walls and floor; its single window, of twelve panes; and all patched and darned muslin cur- tain-a study, forsooth! T' was supremely laughable. Yes; although her nephew had relieved his huge, but overflowing portfolio of sketches drawn, and paintings and engravings purchased, en route, preceding his arrival at Franklin, by hanging them about the walls until they looked liKe those of an artist's studio; although he had draped his window with a piece of rich flannel-green, crimson, and orange-used in the protec- tion of his books, minerals, &amp;c., from injury while travelling; and con- Q verted another of larger dimensions, but of the same material and pur- pose, into a carpet; although he had piled books of all ages, sorts, and sizes, upon his table, under his table, against the walls of the room, and even scattered them about the carpet, until he could scarcely cross his study without stepping on them; yes, although he had done all this-and we had nearly forgotten some old pine shelves, on which he filed min- erals, shells, coins, Indian relics, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and although he spent his day-except a few hours alloted to exercise and chat with his aunt--- then, tumbling over his books and writing in great uncouth characters, what she tried many times, and vainly, to decipher ;-yet, a little, back bed-room a study! Oh, Lor! So thought Mrs. Hayes. But Maria-she could have gazed on them for ever-that same study and its occupant, as he sat there in the dress described at the commencement of this chapter, and so absorded in the contents of a massy tome, as not to observe her entrance. Mrs. Hayes went to meeting; and Maria, dreading that her cousin would leave his seclusion before her mother's return; and longing for the soothing influences she nowhere found but in nature's ministrfes, took her work, hurried out by the back door, through the garden, and up the    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6890-00000011"/> 24      JENNY AMBROSE; OR,' LIFE IN hill, to a seat beneath sheltering rocks and trees near the brow of the em- inence. Then, for a little time, she forgot that there was such a thing as sorrow in the world. Surely she could bear her little trials and mortifi. cations, it was so pleasant to have existence in a world of so much beauty and mystery; and yet, to be different from everybody! There were long- ings ip her heart which seemed wearing her life away; and they were for sympathy. Her musings were interrupted by hearing the rustle of steps among the dried leaves and bushes. She looked in their direction, and saw her cousin industriously making his way through tangled shrubbery to the spot where she sat. Her first impulse was to run. She started up from her seat for that purpose; but, as her ill-luck would have it, she for- got the contents of her lap, and they flew in every direction-ball, wax, shoes, and all. "Oh, dear!" exclaimed poor Maria, the only expression she ever gave to her vexations. "And I must be just so ungracious as to tell you, my cousin, that I am glad for this; else, I suppose, you would have ran away from me again. You will make me think there is something awfully repulsive about me, Maria, if you shun me in this manner. And, even more than this, you will compel me to leave your house, much as I wish to remain, for 1 can- not stay where my presence is evidently annoying." He commenced in a lively strain, as he assisted Maria in the recovery of her sewing implements. It sounded to the sensitive girl like insult. This she would bear from no one but her mother. She drew herself up indignantly, and dropped the wax and ball she had picked up from the ground: all for the purpose of plaguing her cousin, by making him stoop for them. Mr. Flanders saw this; and, half angry at receiving such treatment when a guest and a relative, half sorrowful that such a pretty cousin had been so spoiled by mismanagement, he concluded as has been described. It was now Maria's turn to rue: "Why surely, Mr. Flanders, you don't care what I do or say!" There was astonishment in her tones, and in her large dark eyes, as she raised them to Mr. Flanders's face. "Indeed I do, Miss Hayes; and let me ask,why it is that you treat me in this manner?" He felt all this-Maria saw that he did; and, for the first time in her life, there was the pleasing consciousness that there was one in the wide world to whom her opinions were of some consequence. A thrill of de- light ran through her frame. In her excitement. she forgot her reserve, and every other thing but earnest desires of vindication. "Why, cousin, the truth is, I am ashamed of myself, I am so differ- ent from other people; and I have acted so foolishy since you came here. Besides, I am afraid of you-you know so much, and I am so dreadfully ignorant. And your eyes seem to look right through me, and make me feel as if you would know all my foolish thoughts, if I don't speak them. But for all this, I wouldn't have you go away for all   *THE EASTERN STATES.            25 Franklin; for-for-somehow, it seems to me that I am not naturally so very different from you, if I am from everybody else. So promise me that you will not mind me-that you will forgive everything I do; for, cousin, I sha'n't mean to do anything wrong." Her brilliant eyes were swimming in tears, as she turned them be- seechingly to her cousin, who had seated himself beside her, and taken one of her small hands in both his without her noticing the act--so earn- est was she in her purpose of explanation. Meanwhile, a thousand exci- ting thoughts were stirring in Mr. Flanders, of her extreme beauty and simplicity, of her natural talent and goodness of heart, of what she was, and what she might have been with proper culture. Maria saw enough of this in his expressive face, to satisfy her that she was understood and respected. She added, with an arch smile: "And promise me, cousin, that you won't stare at me any more; at least, not until I learn from you to be like other people." "Why, my good cousin! you are like other people, or like other good and sensible people." Maria's usually pale cheek was flushed with emotion. 'She would have given worlds, if she could but believe her cousin. But memories of a thousand absurd things she had said, and done, rushed through her mind in a minute. "No, cousin-no; I can remember being laughed at from a child, for being so odd in my ways. When we lived at the West, the only beautiful things I saw were the flowers; and I should have gathered them while the rest of the children picked plums, if they had n't laughed, and mother scolded. They-my mates-would run on the tops of our log-houses  and barns, and swing on the high branches of trees, until it made me faint and dizzy to look at them. If a poor, sick, ragged man went by, who was coming back to New-England to die; or if the people at the ale- house got to fighting; or if our neighbors beat their horses or cattle; I always ran away and cried, while the rest all laughed, and called it fun. Wa' n't this being different from othersJMr. Flanders? And so it has always been-so it was in the awful pltce where we lived in Canada. The things that pleased me, others laughed at; and the things they liked, I hated; and for a long time, I have n't allowed myself to say anything but yes or no, when I can help it-only when I come up here and talk with the birds, the brook, and the trees and flowers. You laugh, cousin; now I guess you believe me." "Yes; that you are unlike the cold, plodding, ignorant, unfeeling peo. pie where you lived. But, Maria, have you found none among the ladies of Franklin, who are like you?" "No; we have been here but three weeks, you know, and none have called except a few near mother's age; those I did not see. But, cousin,. I must go now." Mr. Flanders mechanically rose to accompany hel. e  .      ,       .    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6890-00000012"/> 26      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN "I ave you studied much, Maria?" No; nothing but bible, hymn-book, spelling-book, and a few tracts." Maria hesitated and colored slightly: "Or-there were two others-I will tell you about them; but I am afraid you will think me dreadful foolish. The names of the books were 'The Task,' and 'Children of the Abbey.' I found them after father died, among his old papers. They were old, ragged, smoky books; looked, mother and a neighbor to whom she showed them thought, as if they came from pits of darkness. I took them to my room. There, when mother thought I was asleep or at work; and out in the forests, where I went as often as I could get away without being seen-for they all laughed at me so, for being so fond of birds, flowers and streams, that I didn't dare have them know I went-I read those books through, again, again, and again; as many as a dozen times, I think. The people I read about in the ' Children of the Abbey,' I thought were like me in many things. And, oh! how I liked the 'Task!' It was exactly as I felt, every word of it. Well," continued Maria with a sigh, and her features lost their animation; " mother found me one day crying over the ' Children of the Abbey.' She-I needn't tell what she did; but she burnt them, and told me they were the devil's books, written by two of his best servants-and a great deal more. But although I could not read the books, I could remember a great, great deal of them; and I found nearly as much comfort in thinking about them; as  I had done in reading them. Mother said, too, that there were no such people in the world as those I read about; and I never did see anybody at all, at all like them at the West or in Canada. And when we travelled, we went in a covered wagon with an Irish family. I rode in the back part of the wagon; and at night we always stopped at some out-of-the- way, miserable place. But the people here, cousin-they have beautiful houses, yards, gardens, and flowers. , The ladies-those we saw riding the other morning-appeared as it seemed to me the ladies of the 'Chil- dren of the Abbey' did; and ybu, cousin, are my Lord Mortimer. Now, confess, am I not the silliest, oddest person in the world?"  Mr. Flanders was opening thp garden gate. Maria looked up into his face, as she concluded, but its expression puzzled her. She could not, for the life of her, guess whether he was pleased, displeased, or a part of each. Two things were certain: he was intensely interested, and he did not ridicule her. He was like one dreaming. He had read much- thought much-travelled much. He had encountered human nature in almost all its forms, but never anything like this;-a creature so elegant, so unaffected, so intelligent; and with such a parentage, such a culture! They had reached the kitchen. Mr. Flanders had carried Maria's work to the parlor table, and returned to the kitchen, where she was mak- ing preparations for tea. lie paced the room a moment, and then turned ' to his cousin. Maria, would you like to study '" "About what 7"   THE EASTERN STATES.            27 "( About the stars, clouds, tlowers,-in short, about everytning you see around you: about languages, other countries, and other times." "Oh yes, yes!" answered Maria. Her cheeks were flushed, her eye kindled, and her lip quivered. The door opened and Mrs. Hayes came in upon them. "Well, I had a first rate meeting, I tell you. And then I called at Mrs. Pons's; we came out of meeting, and down the road together; and she was so dreadful anxious to have me go in. She seems to be a right-down clever creater, not half so proud as most of the people here appear to be. She says she thinks it is folks' duty to be neighborly. But she asks a terrible sight of questions. It would n't do to ask all about me and Maria, here, but she must ask about you, Will. She wanted to know what your trade was. I pretended that I didn't know-told her 't was-something that kept you shut up in your room almost all the time." "Ha, aunt; tell her I am a shoemaker," said Mr. Flanders, with a laugh, as he brought Maria's work, and sat down beside her for instruc. tiois in sewing on a binding. "She asked me if you wrote and studied; and when I told her you did, it seemed as if she would burst, she was so curious. I expect-or I should n't think strange a bit, if she should come in to-morrow, to see. about it."                4 HAPTER    VI. TO-MORROW evening came, and with it came Mrs. Pons. "You see, Mrs. Hayes, just how magnetic you are," said she, in a hurried tone and manner, as she was making her way to a seat. "But I assure you I am not at all given to ceremony with those I like; so I expect our families will be on the same footing as Damon and Pythias- it will be so decidedly pleasant." Between Mrs. Hayes's wonder what all those long words could mean, and what so fine-dressed and fine-spoken a lady could find in her that was so very nice, she was pretty well stupefied. At first she opened her eyes and mouth wide; and then settled the latter down in an unmeaning, puz. zled grin. Hence she forgot to introduce her visitor to Mr. Flanders and Maria, until reminded of her neglect by a wink from Mrs. Pons. "Oh, Lor! yes; I forgot all about it. This is my husband's sister's son, Mr. William Flanders, of Hartford, Connecticut." There, she had got well through with one half of the job, and she drew a long, loud breath of self-gratification. Meanwhile, the, loquacious Mrs. Pons had shaken Mr. Flanders's hand warmly, and said many things in her pleas. ant way about honor, pleasure, introduction, friendship, her daughter Fanny, &amp;c. &amp;c.    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6890-00000013"/> 28       JENNY A4MBROSE; OR, LIFE IN    An: iny darncu, Marl Hayes, of PlcKwacKet, Upper Canada," con- tinued Mrs. Hayes, with something like desperation in her tone and man- ner. She was extremely anxious about her daughter's deportment upon' the momentous occasion. She had lived so secluded, was so timid, and so different from everybody, she really feared the girl would do nothing at all but run out of the room. So she caught her nervously by the arm, and dragged her from her seat, even before she named her, and then, in a tone meant for a whisper, but unwittingly raised to a sort of scream, she added: ' Shake hand, Mari; say how d' ye d..? and how d' your folks do?"  Maria had never witnessed a regular introduction before; bufher innate sense of propriety enabled her to acquit herself with ease and dignity, l notwithstanding the embarrassing position in which her mother's awkward officiousness placed her. "How do you do, my dear? how is your health?" said Mrs. Pons, turning to Maria, with a smile, which plainly indicated that she was going through a process of solf-gratulation, on her magnarnmity and politeness  in not laugling at Mrs. Hayes's ludicrous failure in etiquettes and in her pleasant reception of the queer daughter of such a queer woman; for queer she did not doubt Maria was, judging from all Mrs. Hayes told her of her singularity, and from a glance at her curious attire as she entered the room. But she was"forced to lay down her complacency. "Really, Mrs. Hayes," said she, regarding Maria-with evident adml- ration and wonder--" really, Mrs. Hayes, your daughter is very unlike you." A flush of anger passed over Mrs. Hayes's face, which her visi- tor did not fail to perceive. "But I dare say the difference is all in age.  You and I, Mrs. Hayes, ' are no more as we have been,' as my daughter  Fanny says to everything; for she is extremely fond of quoting the poets. But, as I was about to observe, a delightful trio you are-so snug and  pleasant, as I tell them at Colonel Ambrose's." She looked round upon the group. Mrs. Hayes frowned less, in partial pacification; Mr. Flan- ders smiled and bowed low, and Maria looked as if she thought Mrs. Pons  an odd specimen of humanity. "And I observed as I came in, you have  a delightful place for a garden."  Yes, and I feel terrible glad of that," answered Mrs. Hayes; " there's nothing I love as well as I do a biled dish with all kinds of sarce, carrits, bates, parsnups, cabbages, turnups, and greens, with good sharp vinegar." ; Yes, very pleasant; and Miss Hayes, I dare say you are quite as fond of flowers. If you have a plat, you shall have carte blanche to our gar- den, and transfer just as many plants as you please. We have a great, beautiftl, and full variety." Oh, I thank -you!" answered Maria, with all the delight and grati. tude of her soul beaming in her face. If Mrs. Pons had offered her "bright jewels from the mine," and gold, she would have been compara- tively indifferent. But flowers! to have them all about her; to look into their beautiful and mysterious eyes; to read there sentiments more sweet, more tihrilling, a thousand times, than that which science attributes to t                  '      THE EASTERN STATES.            29 them; to water them wicen ihirsty ;-flr Maria had something of the feel- ing of the ancient and fanciful Greeks and Romans, who imagined, that in watering a drooping flower, they revived the spirit of that flower-to relieve them when choked with weeds ;r-to do all this, and to share all her delights with her good, generous, and noble cousin; oh! she would certainly be the happiest being on the earth. Such were her thoughts, and very intelligible were they to Mr. Flanders, as she turned her eyes, full of eloquent meaning, to his face. "And well may this sweet cousin of ours rejoice in her new treasure; for there is nothing in this world so like herself, as flowers, nothing else so tender, innocent, and beautiful," said Mr. Flanders, in a letter to his sister, written on the following morning. "Yes; as I thought. I thought you would love flowers," pursued Mrs. Pons. "I dare say your garden will outshine ours. Mr. Flan- ders, you will find it delightful, after a day of sedentary occupation, to go out and handle the hoe awhile; if indeed you are not superior to all labor, but of the intellectual sort." She paused, blushed slightly, and looked inquiringly at Mr. Flanders. "And is not the cultivation of flowers, ' labor of the intellectual sort,' Mrs. Pons?" he asked, smiling. "Why, yes; Mr. Flanders, I dare say it is. Yes; the intellect is as  busy as in study or writing, without doubt; but I never thought of it be- fore. Miss Hayes, I hope you are not so afraid of getting brown, as Fanny is. She neglects her garden excessively on that acdbunt." "Lor! no. Mari don't care nothing about tan. She 'd like to live out of doors all the time, I really believe, if I 'd let her. She 's different from anybody I ever see on that account. She used to, when she was a young 'un, as 't were, she used to go out and play with the flowers that the prairies were chock full of, and with every kind of toads, bugs, worms, and every such terrible thing. There she'd sit and dear them, and try to feed 'em. I used to tell husband, I was really afeard she'd det foul ot a crocodile, or some such a creater. But the poor man used to tell me not to worry a bit; for a lion, or a catamount, or a panther would n't hurt Mari. And I used to think sometimes it did seem as though they would n't, for old Towser Taylor, the crossest dog in oui diggins,.that used to snap, and snarl, and bite at everybody but his master, old Zeb Taylor, would shake his tail off almost, when he could get near Mari; he would jump fairly over her head; and then she would laugh so loud, that it would go over a great clearing to the woods and come back- to us--a real loud laugh. When she had laughed so that she could n't stand up, she 'd slump right down among the tall grass, flowers, toads, and all; and old Towser would cdaper round her, bring mouthful after mouthful of flow- ers apd-grass, and drop them in her lap, until she was almost covered. I remember one day, when she was in such a fix, two very stylish young men came along, that was on a pleasure journey, I found out afterward. They stood and looked at her steady, a half an hour and more, too, with.    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6890-00000014"/> 30      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN out Mari's seeing 'cm. 1 could n't hear what they said, though they were close to our cabin; for they talked low, so to not have Mari see them. One of them took out a pencil and a beautitul covered book, all full of picters and white leaves, and he began to scratch away with his pencil right earnest, I tell you. He had n't worked long before Mari see them, and then his fat was all in the fire; for she run right into the rushes, and Towser after her. Then they see me, and come up to the dloor, and showed me what they 'd been doing. There was only a few lines, as 't were; but I could see Mari's face and old Towser's as plain as day. They wanted me to let her go out the next day and play with the dog, in that same place and way, while they come to the cabin where the child could n't see them, and finished the picter. And so I did; and you never see two peas in a bushel so much alike as Mari, the dog, flowers, her one bare-foot coming out under her gown, her large eyes, curly hair, just as the wind blew it back from her face; and even the stump and old tree near her were like that picter. After the gentleman got through, he wanted me to call her in. They offered her picters, money, and talked just as loving as they could to her; but she would be afraid, in spite of them. Her mouth began to tremble, great shining tears stood in her eyes; then they began to run down her face; and she went off into a corner of the room, hid her face in both hands, and cried  an hour steady. And she did this, Mrs. Pons, when she would talk with the ugliest dog in the world, and with a crbcodile, I 've no doubt, if she could have found one. She 's always been just so different from other folks. When she was rude, she was so wild there was no living with her; and then she 'd cry just as easy as she 'd laugh. I wonder she ha' n't cried afore this time." Maria had been wondering that her mother's ridicule had lost so much of its power over her feelings. But she felt quite sure that, singular as she was, her very noble and pleasant cousin was like her in many respects. He was close by her side; his eye was bent encouragingly on her; she had the very comfortable feeling of being protected by him; and cared little what her mother said about her, since it was sufficiently  evident that the more he heard, the more tenderly he regarded her. "Oh, she is not so easily disturbed, Mrs. Hayes; she is too sensible. 'T is a charming picture you have drawn of her, Mrs. Hayes, as I am quite sure Mr. Flanders will grant me. I do not know when I have beern so interested. Doubtless, Mr. Flanders, a splendid painting, the copy of the pencil-sketch Mrs. Hayes has been so obliging as to tell us about, adorns the gallery of some one of our first artists. This would be delightful, would it not, Mrs. Hayes? But you have a deal of pleas- ure in store for you here. I do think you will find associates more con- genial than the animals of the prairies; those who will be better able to appreciate the value of your friendship properly. You must call at our house often. Now do-we shall be so delighted; I shall tell daughter Fanny to prepare herself and all the village belles, not even excepting   TIlE EASTERN   STATES.         31 the Ambrose girls and Miss Grahamn-to be eclipsed by one Miss Hayes. And my son, Howard-you did not see him yesterday, Miss Ilayes; he is in the capacity of chief clerk for the firm of Lane, Pons E Co. I shall tell him to prepare for a broken heart; that is, if you are cruel as you are fair." With all the light Maria had gathered from the "Children of the Ab- bey," about broken hearts, rivalry, and such things, Mrs. Pons's remarks were scarcely intelligible to her; still she played a very pretty part by listening, elegantly laughing, and declaring that she was not at all mis. chieve-us; and that her new associates would find her quite as inoffensive as her friends, the toads of the prairies, had done. It was now Mrs. Hayes's turn to wonder. "Strange!" thought she. "The girl! afraid to say her soul was her own, among her old acquaint- ances, the poor, ignorant people of the West and Canada :-and now talk- ing like a minister, almost, before her cousin, a college chap, and Lor' knows what else. And this Mrs. Pons, rich, perlite, lives in one of the handsomest houses in Franklin; and the girl-Lor'! I do n't know what she will do some day, in spite of me. Oh, heavenly Father! fix her right; make her what she 'd ought to be." Be it known, that Mrs. Hayes had the habit, when perplexed, of reliev. ing herself by this sort of supplication; if, indeed, it may be dignified by this term. There were, certainly, no thoughts of a Supreme Being, or of dependence. But she said--'"Oh, heavenly Father, help us!" or, "Oh, Lor', fix us right!" just as she would have said, "Oh dear! how vexa- tious!" if this latter had been allowed to grow into an habitual form of expression. She was interrupted in the midst of her gloomy cogitations, by Mrs. Pons inquiring, if she had called on the Ambroses. She had been informing Mr. Flanders and Maria, that Fanny was soon to give a splendid party; and that the occasion would be, for them, an open sesame to the best society in the place. "Lor', no!" said Mrs. Hayes, in reply to Mrs. Pons. ." They live in such a grand way, and appear to be so terrible proud! My walk' and Mari's must be, as it always has been, with 'the meek and lowly in 'heart.' Do they belong to the church?" "Oh, yes; Colonel Ambrose, and his father before him, have been the very corner-stones of the church, ever since it was founded. Oh, they are delightful people! I assure you our families are on the most inti- mate terms. Or, it happens some way, that our girls are not precisely like the Siamese Twins in their companionship.

But, my good friends, do let this be entre nous, inter nos. [ am too apt to speak all my thoughts to people I like; and, of all things, I find reserve, and a suspicious picking and culling of ideas before speaking, the most intol. erable. 'T is so pleasant to repose entirely in one's friends.

But, as I told Fanny, Dr. Jolnson had his experience, his opinions; and I have mine, and I can rely upon them. Fanny is very particular. She reads a great deal; and she seems to have the idea that every one who writes, is to be considered an authority. This is very pleasant, and proper, but I cannot bring myself to walk il such formal traces." Fanny's application of Dr. Johnson's sentiments to her mother was cor- rect. She "L made every one a denizen of her bosom ;" and good-natured, generous as she was, she "could not be styled a friend." She was supremely wretched, if there was a family in the village, the very pene- tralia of whose hearts and household she was not permitted to range, that she might admire their lares and penates, and sound their praises throughout the circle of her intimates. She never felt self-upbraidings, except those called forth by finding in heart glimmerings of the sin un- pardonable of her calendar, a feeling of hostility to a neighbor, not caused by a concealment on his or her part, of plans or proceedings. "I wonder how I have offended them? we have always been so intimate!" was always her first exclamation, if news of importance came to her through a third party. Second in the list of annoyances to which she was subject, came those vacuums in conversation which would sometimes occur, in spite of her lprecautions in collecting themes for use, before making a call. ITnder their infliction, she invariably presed the fore finger of her right hand upon her firmly compressed lips, and settled her eyes upon the floor or ceiling. 'Twas but a moment; and her hands returned to their wonted task, demolishing the fringe of her shawl, the string or tassel of her reticule, or the corner of her pocket-handkerchief; her dilated eyes sparkled with renewed animation; and she started off, as she did at Mrs. -laves's, after a process similar to the one just described, succeeding the service of Fanny and Dr. Johnson. "Oh! have vou heard that the Ambroses are to have a visitor from abrcadl? No-it can't be; 't is so recently they had the interesting an- nouncement.  T will be delightful-so pleasant! I have n't heard just where he belongs; somewhere at the south, though, I believe. He has been travelling since completing his education-his professional educa- tion, I believe. Here will be a delightful companion for you, Mr. Flan- ders. They say he is sole heir to more than half a million. I don't know exactly how the acquaintance comes; but I believe he is the son of a Miss Marshall, whom I have often heard Mrs. Ambrkse mention in the most affectionate terms, and who was her school-companion at Hop- kins,. in her, girlhood. I have n't seen Mrs. Ambrose since the intelli- gence catun; I must call to-morrow. She will be so delighted! she is so attached to old friends. Miss Graham is made perfectly at home tlere, I see; and she is really a charming girl-so pleasant! You will ad- mire her, all of you. She is so sprightly and elegant, one cannot help thinking of sylphs, gazelles, fawns, and all such beautiful creatures, when   TilE EASTIERN STATES.           33 one looks at her; especially as I saw her yesterday, when I passed the colonel's on my way to 'Squire Holmes's, in her short-sleeved, thin, white muslin, floating about her graceful form, with her curls, bonnet-ribbons, veil, and all. She was surrounded by a flock of merry creatures of all sorts: Fido-and, Mrs. Hayes, he was old. Towser's equal in jumping, for he almost reached Miss Graham's head; their little Maltese kitten- and I never saw a creature put down her little feet so gracefully as sh1 did; and then there, were rabbits, hens, chickens, peacocks, parrot, and all. 'T was the most unique melange I ever saw in one assemblage; and with Miss Graham, I think a painter might have found nearly as good a subject for his pencil, as did the one you mentioned, Mrs. Hayes. I thought of my brother, who is a'painter in Philadelphia. He is a rare enthusiast, and is always occupied-or lately, since his great wealth enables him to spend his time and talent as he pleases-he is occupied with odd and delightful conceptions of his own, founded, perhaps, upon some little incident like the one you described, or--and, as I live!" she exclaimed, suddenly interrupting herself, and seizing Maria's arm with nervous energy, while her face and neck became red as crimson- "as I live, Miss Hayes-Mrs. Hayes, I saw the very picture you de- scribed to me! Why didn't I think of it before? I remember it now all as distinctly- : it was in a rich, massy gilt frame--was of prodigious size, the portrait as large as life, and there was an extensive and beau- tiful scenery; and it occupied the most favorable position in his studio. I am .so delighted at this coincidence!"She grasped, Maria's hand; warmly, in hers, as she paused to take breath. Maria's emotion was nearly equal to hers. She became pale and red by turns; and Mrs. Pons felt her hand tremble in hers. "It is a delightful reminiscenct," pursued Mrs. Pons, musingly. "It was five years ago. I remember I was talking with Judge Hale abeut his portrait, which we were examin- ing; and I heard brother say to Mrs. Hale, who was standing with him before your picture, Mis&amp;Hayes-he had been telling her its history, I supposed; for he said he had been waiting, I forget how long, but several years, for the original of that picture to become a woman; and in two years he was going to visit her, and make his home, his hand, and his heart hers, if she would accept them. And I do remember now-hie did go West in two years: he wrote us about it. Oh! I am so pleased and excited! Was ever anything so lucky and so singular? We expect a visit from him this season: so prepare yourself, Miss Iayes, for the miis. tres of one of the most aristocratic-looking houses in the most aristocratic part of Philadelphia. You will have tables, vases, and statues of marble and gilt; hangings of India silk and silver, that sweep the floors. You wiil have Persian carpets and Turkish rugs, in whose rich fleece your little feet will be almost lost. You will have a splendid verandah, filled with the most rare and beautiful exotics from all quarters of the world, upon which the windows and doors of your most luxuriant rooms will open.

And this would be just like him, all romance and goodness of heart as he is." Still, Maria persisted in laughing; yet it was more in nervousness than anything else. Mrs. Hayes joined her, and Mr. Flanders; but his laugh was husky and unnatural-strangely deficient in its wonted melody. ( Well, I declare, I must go. I long to tell Fanny about this; and I do think I must indulge myself in writing my discoveries to brother. He would be here in a week. How pleasant our society will be! I can echo Professor Bancroft. He was in at our house last evening; and when we were talking about Col. Ambrose's visitors, and your arrival and demestication here, Mr. Flanders, he said, ' Our little village seems to be at this time the nucleus of all interesting things.' And he was think- ing, too, of the lyceum and library. Did you know, Mrs. Hayes, that we are to have a course of lectures from some of the best speakers in New- England; and that our old library is to be resuscitated, and largely re. plenished?" Mrs. Hayes was ignorant of the facts. "Well, it is even so. The subject has been agitated occasionally for years, but more as something longed for than expected; yet now, that all have contributed their mite of action and money, it proves to be the easiest thing in the world. I am delighted, although I find but little time to read. Now, do call often, all of you. If there is anything in the world I admire, it is social habits of feeling and intercourse among neighbors. You will promise to call?" So they all promised to call as early as convenient; and Mrs. Pons took up her departure, after assuring them that she had yet five or six calls to make. ' Oh!" she exclaimed, reopening the door she had just closed, "strange I couldn't recollect that shuthern gentleman's name! it is Howard. He is from Virginia, I believe, and his father was a planter. Good evening, again." She bowed, smiled, and left the house with a brisk step. CHAPTER    VII. MRS. HAYES was standing near the door of her own little room. She turned pale; and, with a stifled groan, she entered her room and closed the door. Maria was painfully startled, although such emotions were by no means of rare occurrence. Mrs. Hayes always imputed them to pal- pitation of the heart; and many years ago, she forbade all inquiries or remedies on Maria's part. She remained in her room but a few minutest then entered the kitchen by another door, and commenced preparations for tea. Mr. Flanders went to the garden, called Maria, and she followed   THE EASTERN STATES.           35 him. Mrs. Hayes did not observe this at first, so absorbed was she by her unpleasant speculations. "Lor!" muttered she, as she threw the cutlery violently on the table, "what can' I do?" Then, clatter, clatter, went the plates to their places. "Oh, that I had died! had died first!" and then the chairs were thrown to the table. "Mari! here, Mari! you out there? You silly creater! out there pawing in the dirt! Come right in, or I'll punish you, if you are as big as one side of Colonel Ambrose's house!" Maria ran immediately to the kitchen, followed by her cousin. t( What is it? what is it, aunt Hayes? Is the house on fire?" asked her nephew, laughing. Mrs. Hayes longed to box his ears, but she might not; so she turned to pour her wrath on Maria. "You sarcy creater, Mari! I declare, I can hardly keep my hands off of you! Here we are-your cousin and I down to the table, you washing your nasty hands, and not a morsel of butter on the table. You know it al- ways belongs to you to get the butter." Maria did not know any such a thing, but she brought the butter forth. with; and sitting down to the table, she began to consult her mother about a flower-plat, with a cheerfulness and good humor, a thousand times more anpoying to that lady than tears, or even stormy invective would have been. But Mr. Flanders joined issue with pleas of need of exercise for himself. He offered ample remuneration for what she might lose in " onions, bates, carrits, and turnups," as the old lady called them. And he promised that if she would permit Maria to help him occasionally, he would help her bind shoes. His arrangements were so ludicrous, Maria's laugh was so like that of a frolicsome child, and so infectious withal, that Mrs. Hayes yielded, as it were, per force. "Yes, yes; have it so if you will," said she, as they rose from the table. "You may go now, Mari; and I'll do up the work. But you need n't be so tickled about it; you 'll have to work all the harder to- morrow, to pay for't." Sad. were her thoughts when left to herself. The happy tones of her nephew and daughter, which occasionally reached her through the open casement, only added to her melancholy. They were to her, "the sounds of days that are no more," when she was young, carelessi and innocent as they were then. So strong were her reflections, that they shook her athletic frame, blanched her tawny cheek to the frightful hue of death, and vented themselves, at intervals, in broken exclamations of remorse and sorrow.

And so it comes to this! She'll hate me, and--" She buried her face in her hands, and sat a long time silent; then rose, walked to the window, and fixed her eyes earnestly on Maria. Gradually her countenance lost its fierceness, and assumed an expression of subdued    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6890-00000017"/> 36      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN melancholy. "Yes, yes," she murmured; "she is beautitui as an angel. Yes, she 'll rise; her cousin-her cousin!--will help her; all Frankliu will help her; and she 'll hate me-and HT 'll die!" lHer unhappy revery was broken by the brisk tones of Mrs. Pons, who stopped at the gate on her return from her round of civilities. "[ita! this is right, my young friends. How delightful! 'Tis so plra'ant to see a beautiful garden before a cottage, or cottage orn,6, as Fa'nnv calls it.

Well, this is right; it is so pleasant to sit down to pleasant thoughlts after the duties of the day are over, I tell our folks. But I must go. Good evening, again." In a few minutes came the "little rogue Henry," tugging along, as fast as his short legs would allow, a basket full of plants. There were dahas, petunias, mints, larkspurs, monks'-hoods, asters, &amp;c.; carna- tions, "a full and splendid variety of morning-glories," said the neat label; and, besides, a parcel inclosed in the last "Courier," superscribed, ,. House-plants, for Mrs. and Miss Hayes, and Mr. Flanders. Respect- fully, &amp;c.' It was in an obsolete style of chirography, evidently Mrs. Pons's. The conte ts were geraniums of more than a dozen kinds, monthly roses, }ridal rose, tiger-lily, rock-daisy, &amp;c. For these Mr. Flanders ordered pots of Lane, Pons &amp; Co.; and a stand of Messrs. Albot, while Maria was arranging the relative positions of the garden- plants, with reference to different degrees of altitude as indicated by their labels. They arranged them in bunches, all along the sides of the walk that led through the garden from the cottage door; and then returned to the house, to show Mrs. Pons's present to Mrs. Hayes. "See, mother! what a pretty present from Mrs. Pons!" said Maria; , and, bv-and-by, you must go out and see how we have bewitched our arde2n." ,he looked up with a smile; and, for the first time, noticed her mother's changed appearance. "Mother, are you sick? Mother!" Maria rose, threw down the contents of her lap,' and laid her hand on her mother's shoulder. "Mother, what does ail you? are you sick?" MrI. Flanders, too, was excessively alarmed by her altered looks. It seemed that years of suffering could not work such havoc. , No-no-I ain't sick," said Mrs. Hayes, in a tone of touching sub- jection and melancholy. 'T was faint, sad, and tremulous, as that of a weeping child.   THE EASTERN STATES.            37 "Oh say, mother! my own dear mother-what is the matter?" exclaimed Maria. She sunk again into her chair, almost brea hless with terror. Mrs. Hayes turned to her, and fixed her sunken, livid eyes upon her face-"Your own dear mother-mother!" Again her frame shook, and she fell into Mr. Flanders's arms in a terrible fit of convulsions. That constituted a new epoch in Maria's existence, half-mournful, and half-pleasant. The lion became a lamb. But it was mournful to see so much of energy, physical and mental, prostrated in one brief hour; and pitiful beyond expression was it to see her afterward, as Maria saw her, humble, quiet, retiring by herself to weep and pray; and then returning once'more to her mechanical discharge of household duties. -She looked up to Maria, as to a superior being, for advice and for comfort; and Maria soon felt for her all the tenderness and anxiety she would have expe- rienced for-a cherished, suffering, and dear child. Thus wss she raised, in one day, from the oppressed, degraded condition of a very slave, to be the counsellor and support of her mother. What energies, hitherto dor- mant, sprang up with her new duties! She was no longer a timid crea.  ture, shrinking from every glance; but a calm, dignified woman. Her cheek and brow no longer wore the invariable hue of a marble statue, and her manners its coldness and repose, as before her cousin's arrival; but the rich blood mounted to her cheeks, and retired, with every change of feeling. Her manners became singularly graceful and variable- grave, gay, or indifferent, as the impulse seized her, and the occasion jus- tified. She commenced and prosecuted her studies with a degree of ardor and success, that astonished her cousin, enthusiastic as had' been his hopes, much as he had calculated on her natural ability. The only obstacle to her progress that he foresaw and dreaded-the persecutions of her mother-had been removed. "Yes, Maria-yes; study on. You were born for great things-; and H shall hold out but a little longer; and let me do the work while I can. Do n't say a word against it, Maria; I'd rather, for I can 't bear my thoughts a minute if I ain't busy-they will kill me; so go now to your books and study." And Maria did study; morning, noon, and evening, as they passed, found her at her toils; and morning, noon, and evening, witnessed the delight and improvenent'she imbibed at every draught from learning's fountain. She neglected her plants, society, and exercise-except so much of the latter, as she found in assisting her mother occasionally-until compelled, by failing appetite and strength, to attend to the entreaties of her cousin, and the dictates of her own prudence. Then she worked in her garden 1-alf an hour each day; and, accompanied by her assiduous-teacher, she roved through fields and pastures, mounted rocky precipices, and descended the deep shelving banks of the river, for illustrations of her lbssons in botany, natural philosophy, and geology. Every step she took in her in. vestigations of nature and science, opened, as it were, a new world before her, full of untold interest and beauty. 3    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6890-00000018"/> 38      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN Thus passed a month away. Then came invitations to Miss Fanny Pons's party. "Oh, dear!" exclaimed Maria, handing the card .to her cousin after reading it. It will be remembered, that this was a cidevant expression of hers; but it had not been uttered once in the last happy month. "Well, my cousin, we will go by all means," said Mr. Flanders, as he laughingly drew his hand across Maria's troubled brow. "It will open another most interesting book before you-the science of human nature: an important study for her, is n't it, aunt?" "Yes-yes, Maria, it is-yes; I would go, Maria," said Mrs. Hayes, in the low,-pensive tones, with which she invariably addressed Maria. "No, my mother: I can't go, and leave you alone. You know how low spirited it makes you." "No matter, Maria-no matter. I ought to suffer." For a moment the unhappy woman's emotions stopped her utterance. Then she con- tinued, in the same desponding tone--"I '1 ask the good old Mrs. Has. tings to come and stay with me.. Yes-she will comfort me, poor, weak, trembling sinner, as I am-she 'll bring me right to the feet of my Saviour-yes; and to the bosom of my God. Then I sha'n't be low-spir. ited, Maria-no." "No, dear mother. But pray, do n't reproach yourself so, when you are so good and kind to cousin William and me; when you love God so well; and pray to him so much, and so sincerely," replied Maria, laying her hand beseechingly upon her mother's. "Ah, Maria! but I do n't take up the heaviest part of my cross. 1 do n't confess all my sins-not even to you, Maria. But I must-I shall. Go now to your studies, if you will." "And so it is decided, nem. con., that we go to that party." "No, William; I have yet a host of arguments against it." "The first and most important, if you please." "Why-my dress is not exactly suitable. My old bombasin does well enough for meetings, and all necessary purposes, with my new shawl to conceal the very old-fashioned waist and sleeves; but it is not proper for large parties, I think, from what I guess of parties. Is it, cousin? Is it, mother?" "No-I suppose it ain't; but you can have a new dress, and anything else new you want. We have money enough; and it's all yours, Maria." Maria had many other objections; such as loss of time, trouble, ex- pense, &amp;c. But they were all overruled, and it was settled-much to Mr. Flanders's satisfaction-that he and Maria should go out to select a dress, and make other necessary purchases; and that Miss Harvey should be employed to assist in preparations; and, finally, that they should go to Miss Fanny Pons's party. The truth is, Maria felt many misgivings on account of her total ignorance-as far as experience was concerned- of the customs of good society. This she confessed to her cousin after- ward, when they were left together. He attempted to convince her that   THE EASTERN STATES.            39 she might rely confidently upon her natural good sense, elegance, quick and correct perceptions of propriety, et cetera; and was partially suc- cessful, it seems; for she certainly felt, subsequently, much less repug- nance to the measures. CHAPTER    VIII. "PAPA, mamma, Carl, Hal, Nora, Mr. Howard, and all!" exclaimed Jane Ambrose, bounding into the sitting-room, on her return from a strawherry hunt, with Frederic. Her sun-bonnet was thrown back, and kept from falling by. means of a snarl in her veil and bonnet-strings. Her curls, in graceful confusion, were floating about her face and neck; but, with a toss of her head as she spoke, she threw them back from her high, pol. ished forehead. Her lips and the points of ner fingers were made still more rosy than usual, by stains of strawherries, and her cheeks likewise; for little Sarah Blanchard, who accompanied them, insisted upon making a " perfect beauty out of her," by painting her cheeks. She had a wreath of clover, she and Sarah had braided, and another of evergreens hanging about hei neck and shoulders. She had torn her dress in climbing a fence, and soiled it in sitting down among the grass and plums. On the whole, she was the most grotesque appearance one can conceive. "How the plot does thicken!" she continued, after joining a moment in the laugh raised at her expense. "We met Mrs. Pons. Hecr step was so hurried, and she looked so charged, I warned Fred to prepare for an ex. plosion. She began to talk about-so pleasant-such attractions-Fanny -so delightful-Mr..Howard-Mr. Flanders-Professor Bancroft-even before she was near enough so that we could collect anything but em- phatic words." "Well, well; to the point, Jin. What did she say, and what did n't she?" asked Miss Graham. "Why, she said, ' I am so delighted!'" and Jane put herself into a gen- eral attitude of Mrs. Pons's, and assumed just her tone and style of deliv- ery. "' And Mr. Howard is just in season. Oh! 'twill be so pleasant! And all the fashion, and all of the literati, will be there! Besides, I am more than half-expecting my brother from Philadelphia; every moment, "Jane! Jane!" exclaimed Mrs. Ambrose, reprovingly, now that she had gained the command of her risibles. "Yes, Jin, let go this circumldcution; and tell us, ip good set terms,' what new incidentals in the plot there be," entreated Miss Graham. "I am so curious about it, that if the secret were hid in an awful Blue Room, I should open sesame at the door."    <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6890-00000019"/> 40      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN "Guess what she said, all of you," answered Jane, with the most pro. voking nonchalance. "Nonsense, Jane," said Caroline. "But 't is the only way, I suppose; so I will even guess that she presumed upon your stained, dirty face, and asked you, very honestly, to what tribe you belonged." "Yes, and upon the soiled and tattered state of your dress; and ad- vised you tor run home, under the impression that your mother did n't know you were out," said Mrs. Ambrose, with a quiet smile. All laughed; and the colonel, Henry, Frederic, and Miss Graham, clapped their hands and cheered. Mrs. Ambrose did not often produce a piece of pleasantry of that sort, and it amused the more on that account. "Allow me to congratulate you, Jennie, upon your signal victory over your mother and Caroline, in this guessing business," said Miss Graham, in a mock-heroic tone, shaking Jane warmly by the hand. "Shall we proceed?" "Ha! no; thus much suficeth; and so I will advertise you that Fanny Pons will give a party on tne fourth--the glorious'fourth!" "Io triumphe! if I d, n't, Jennie!-if I do n't punish you for some of your misdeeds," said Miss Graham. "I 'll look killing-ogle Mr. Bald- win-employ my archery on Mr. Flanders. Seriously, I am determined on conquest in that quarter. Caroline and I met him this morning at the post-office. He is splendid-not exactly splendid, either; but of just the taking sort I admire. How shall I proceed? To bring Mr. Baldwin to my feet, I need but insert anno domini in some anecdote told for the very Furpose, and afterward put on a recollective air, and ask him if anno does not come from annual, and if it is not in the genitive ;. and if domini is not in the ablative, from domino. What a sudden amplification there would be in his circumference, altitude, and 'pomp and circumstance.' He would say: ' I regret it, Miss Graham, you are so profound and ordinarily so correct in classical literature; but, perforce, forsooth, I must contro. vert your position. Apropos, did is ever chance to occur to you that con. trovert comes from contra, argument, and verto, I turn? And, further- more, that position is from the Latin positio, to place? But first, do you recollect the origin of the term episode?' Then I should Lord-Burleigh my head to prevent another episode. 'Yes, doubtless, you are so erudite. Ahem! Well, anno is from annus, and is in the ablative-with, from, in, by--n the year, you perceive, Miss Graham. And domini is in the genitive, from dominus--of, a, or our Lord-you will not fail to recognize, Miss Graham.'" "Ah! this is a caricature, Ellenora," said Caroline. "No, positively. 'T is a faithful copy of our conversation at Professor Bancroft's. But how to proceed in my coup-de-main upon Mr. Flanders, is a more difficult affair. I think I must dress bewitchingly; and, to this end, my dress shall be afac simile of the fashion plate in the last ' book."' "And hence be sure to come out with just as many puffs, frills, rosettes, curls, &amp;c., &amp;c. as Fanny Pons; for you know the ' book' is her stand. /   THE EASTERN STATES.            41 ard in all things; dress, attitudes, and all. If a jtor? comes out in it about some Lady Bountiful, who-in a simple white dress, straw cottage, and with a flower in her hair, and another in her bosom-calls on the sick, or carries with her own soft white bands, baskets of provisions to the poor, upon this hint she acts; and I do believe she has suffered on such occa. sions, when she found she had been superseded in her object, by those who did not wait to catch benevolent purposes from the pages of the 'Lady's Book.'" "Charity, mry child!" said Mrs. Ambrose, rising to leave the room. Well, mamma, in charity I ask, if this is not true of Miss Pons?" But Mrs. Ambrose had left the room, followed by her husband. "Well, Jennie, and if it is, you know it is a law in philosophy, that there can be no effect without a cause; and how can Fanny, or any one do good without a motive?" .So said Frederic, with a look half of bash- ful modesty, and half of self conceit. "Oh! not at all, surely, Fred. But 't is of her motives-and yet it is not of the least consequence to settle the question." "No, Jennie," said Caroline, kissing her cheek. "We know that, "Who made the heart, 't is He alone Decidedly can try us.'" "Yes, my sister; but I forgot this, as I quite too often do. 'T is true, we have no right to judge her; for we cannot know that she does not find these impulses in a generous heart." 4' Come, my boys," said Mr. Ambrose, reappearing at the sitting room door. "Come, I think we are pretty well rested; and we must ex- change the cool twilight of this room,'for the heat of the field; and the noise of these chatter-boxes, for the whisp of the scythe." Frederic went whistling out of the room. Ellenora sat on a low otto- man, at Harry's feet. He took a rose from the vase on the table beside him, put it in her hair, donned his broad-brimmed hat, and left the room with a smile and bow. The time spent by Mr. Ambrose and " his boys," as he called them, in rest and refreshment, was exceedingly" enjoyed by the whole family. Mrs. Ambrose, her daughters, and Miss Graham, left their occupations at the same time, and brought cold water, fruit, and other slight refresh- ment, cheerful hearts and well-stored intellects, to their mutual comfort and entertainment. Sometimes one read, while others listened, or com- mented as they pleased; sometimes science, physical4or moral, or both, was discussed; not unfrequently politics, and occasionally light litera. ture; or, perhaps a part of them sang, while one of the girls played the piano, Harry his flute, and Fred his trombone. Happy is it for the farmer, the farmer's wife, the farmer's sons, and the farmer's daughters, when such recreations are interposed to lighten and to bless their toils! when their intellect and affections are made as vigor- /     9    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6890-00000020"/> 42      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN ous, rich, and lovely, as " herb, tree, fruit, and flower," that spring up under their hands! CHAPTER IX. LARGE parties were of rare eccurrence at FranKrln. They had sew- ing circles, and a Young People's Literary Association. These were very pleasant, particularly the last, especially after the gentlemen were admitted in the evening-it is conceded to a certain editor, out in York State-and there was much promiscuous visiting. Mrs. Lawrence and Mrs. Herbert, were very intimate. One week, usually on the afternoon of washing day, Mrs. Lawrence received a visit from Mrs. Herbert, by invitation, extended by hanging a white cloth from the east garret window. On the next week, Mrs. Lawrence returned the civility; and on the next, accompanied by Mrs. Moore, and Mrs. Cummings, she visit- ed Mrs. Lane; taking along with her perhaps a work-basket of colossal dimensions, full of stockings to be mended, or a dress, shirt, pants, or something of that sort and size, to be made or repaired; perhaps yarn to be wound, or even twisted before knitting. But no matter; she might have taken her spinning, and kept the wheel buzzing all the afternoon, and her companions would not have been at all incommoded; so beloved and respected was she, by all-rich and poor, old and young, learned and igqorant-for her quiet, but active benevolence, for her invariable good- humor, and her intelligence. "She is so good and sensible, I really do n't think she has an enemy in the world," was the universal phrase- ology used in describing her; and it was due to such a combination of intelligence, charity, and unostentation-a combination as rare as it is beautiful. Mrs. Moore invariably wore a dress of mourning print, and a black silk kerchief, which was pinned closely about her throat, and which carried three plaits on each side, exactly corresponding in size, and mode of arrangement, till it met her light gingham apron, when it disappeared entirely. She carried a faded green silk reticule, of sufficient amplitude to convey her spectacle-case, knitting-work, with a bright tin needle-sheath, snuff-box, and two pocket handkerchiefs-one in ordinary use; and no one ever saw it distinctly enough to be at all confident about its size, color, or materials, it had suqh a neutral look, and was handled so dexterously. The, other was of silk, flaming red and yellow, " wisely kept for show," it seemed; for it always lay un- opened in her lap. She always started off with her meek pace from home at two o'clock, precisely; and she as invariably returned "( before nilking time." She seemed destined, merely to fill an out-of-the-way chink, wherever she went, under ordinary circumstances. But when pa. tient hearts were needed, and hands that never wearied in their ministra- lions to protracted disease, or poverty, it was to Mrs. Moore the eye of the   THE EASTERN STATES.           ,43 sufferer turned with confidence and trust. Her's was the feeble and un- appreciated, but constant light, that shines unheeded amid the glare of meteors; but it was not the less, " the light that shineth, more and more, unto the perfect day." Mrs. Cummings visited just when it was perfectly convenient. It was evident, from the light step with whioh-she tripped through the streets-it might be at three, it might be at four, or even at half-past four, herself in silk or mousseline-de-laine, and her little black eyed. daughter, in while muslin, and red gaiters; from her loud and merry laugh which met every funny saying of the loquacious, witty, and intelligent Mrs. Herbert; and from the grace and vivacity, with which she glided about among books, pictures, flowers, minerals, and shells, and globes;-if such there were-that she did not visit because she had come to the thoughtful and sober conclusion, that duty or propriety demanded the sacrifice. Not at all. But all because it was the pleasantest thing in the world, next to reading the last novel, playing with her baby, and plaguing her some- what antiquated, but handsome and noble husband, until he caught her fondly in his arms, kissed her, and called her a saucy baggage. Not so was it with Mrs. Sprague; duty-duty-was her unfailing plea in the performance of every act, however trivial. And this would have been well, if she had had sufficient discrimination to decide correctly between the promptings of bigotry, of depraved tastes, weak judgment, and the dictates of the religion of Jesus. But it seems she had not. For she could not make it appear to be her duty, to give clothing or sustenance to the children of the inebriate, Ned Morton, or to watch by his sick wife. Morton was so wicked! such a wretched being! she really feared the judgment of Heaven on himself, and all who encouraged him in his vicious course by pampering his family! The event has proved that she "calculated without her host." Ned Morton is now a temperate and a happy man. He often declares, while tears of gratitude and christian humility, roll down his cheeks, that it was the kindness and tender solici- tude of undeserved friendship-next to Heaven-that saved him, that es. tablished his goings, and put a new song into his mouth, even praise to his God. Mrs. Sprague's intercourse was restricted, as far as possible, to mem- bers of her own religious sect; and on more than one occasion, when called upon by a lady of another society, who urged hJer to return her visit, she answered, "I will try; but you must excuse me if I do n't call often. I hardly find time to do my duty to my own church." Over Mr. Gowe, his family, and his church, she maintained the strict- est scrutiny. Not a single expenditure in his family, which she deemed inconsistent with the fact that he derived-his support from the church- herself inclusive-not a single redundancy which appeared in the dress of his wife or daughters, was allowed to pass uncensured; not a single lamb strayed, or seemed to her vigilant eyes to stray from the flock, that    <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6890-00000021"/> "      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN she did not conceive it her duty to reprove. If she succeeded in re- claiming it, she indeed bore it on her shoulders rejoicing; if not, her Inaledictions were scattered without stint; and there was a roughness and severity in them really terrible to ordinary nerves. Yet Mrs. Sprague was not a mere drug in the market. Some there were, who were invulnerable to other motives than fear; and who were sometimes restrained in their practices of evil, through dread of the lashings of Mrs. Sprague's tongue. But Mrs. Ambrose; Mrs. Lawrence, Mrs. Her- bert, and others of that little village, who might be named, were of the kind that goes to constitute the ballast of society. They avoided alike the gloomy uncharitableness of the bigot, the boisterous mirthfulness afnd cold sensuality of the mere worldling; thus setting aside the pro- v\c  Incidit in Scyllam, qui vult vitare Charybdim." It was remarked, in the commencement of this chapter, that large par. ties rarely occurred in Franklin village; hence, evqrybody looked for- ward to the one under contemplation, with feelings of no common inte- rest. Nothing could excel Miss Fanny Pons's solicitude about arrange- ments. It was to be so brilliantly attended, and so select, too, for a general party.! Mrs. Pons was not at all anxious-it would be so de- lightful! the Ambroses, their visitors, Mr. Flanders-how pleasant! (Oh, dear! what shall we do for ottomans?" said Fanny, as she looked round the parlor, now become almost complete in its arrange- ments. "Well, it would be delightful to have some; I did not think of it be- fIre. The Ambroses have half-a-dozen-beauties." "I care nothing at all what the Ambroses happen to have; but in all novels and sketches, where the scenes are laid in high life, they have ottomans, and find them elegant lounges." "Yes, delightful. Well -- " "You know we have a great many boxes of different sizes thrown out of Mr. Lane's store. We might select some, of suitable proportions, for ottomans, and cover them with the carpeting left of the sitting-room. I have seen that style in several elegant engravings. But then, mother, do n't for mercy's sake tell how we made them; you always do tell all such things. Have you ordered the china from Mr. Lane's?" "Yes; two sets like that the Ambroses bought lately. Everybody admired that so much." t"Nonsense! all because the Ambroses happened to have it. 'T was Caroline's choice, I have no doubt-all white, and so smooth! It is my opinion, Caroline Ambrose will die a quakeress some day. I like that best that has a figure of crystals and flowers; 't is so scientific. Papa savs he cannot afford that moreen for curtains in the dining-rooms; so I suppose we must make those cheap green shades do. But it is too bad. 'The Ambroses have some just like them in their kitchen and back rooms. "   THE EASTERN STATES.            45 "Yes, Fanny; but then it will be so pleasant after all. I shall be so delighted, I am sure I shall not think of the curtains. Everybody will De so happy!" "I am sorry, after all, that we invited that Mary Atherton." Fanny bit her lip, as she stood with her eyes fixed upon a soiled and faded rug. "And Maria Hayes, too-your descriptions are so coleur de rose, there is no such a thing as judging from them. I saw her yesterday; and so oddly a dressed personage I never saw. She will have a bad effect on the general appearance of our rooms-a real deformity." "We shall see, Fanny. I would n't be afraid to present her to Victo. ria, herself. The Ambrose girls are anxious to make her acquaintance, and help her into notice." "Yes, doubtless. She is to be chaperoned by a talented and elegant stranger, who is her cousin, merely. So their envy is not startled; and, perhaps, they will succeed in making their way to the good graces of Mr. Flanders, by patronizing his companion. I heard Miss Graham avow her designs upon him, all because he is doing some romantic, mysterious thing. She thinks he is a poet; fbr she said 'he has just the pensive, quiet, yet mischievous look of that species of bipeds ;'-an elegant ex- pression for a lady, by the way. But it was what one might expect. She went out yesterday and helped Mr. Ambrose, Harry, and Frederic, rake hay. She rides in the cart, and carries water and plums out to the fields to them, and their hired men. But, mother, what shall we do about this rug "' "Why, Fanny?" "Why! I should n't think you would ask. It is all worn out, and as nasty as rot!" So it seems, that Miss Fanny Pens did sometimes depart from her ob- servance of the rules of the " books." She had brought herself into an irritable frame, now, by thinking and talking about the Ambr oses, Mr. Flanders, and Miss Graham, especially Miss Graham; else, perhaps, she would not have been so brusque. Yet does this excuse her? Yes- her mother thought; and, therefore, instead of giving reproof, she only' sought to soothe her, by promises to use her influence with Mr. Pens in favor of a new rug. She was partially successful; Fanny retained only enough of her offended dignity to insure her mother's compliance with all of her whims. She proposed an evacuation of Mrs. Pons's bed-room, and its appropriation as a study, pro tempore. Mrs. Pens looked really trou- bled; but Fanny urged, that everybody who was anything at all, had a  study for their globes, maps, portfolios, book-case, and everything con. nected with study. "It would be so much trouble, Fanny," remonstrated Mrs. Pons timidly. "Our friends would all be just as happy without it. And I like to see  all such things in the sitting-room and parlor." "A mere educational prejudice! One that almost everybody has in the country; and if there were to be none but country people here, I should 4    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6890-00000022"/> "      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN not mind it. But Mr. Flanders, Mr. Howard, and Miss Graham-all from fashionable cities-and then if uncle should come! Oh! I am all in a flutter when I think of it. It is quite too bad about those magazines." "What magazines, Fanny?" "Why, have you forgotten? Those I ordered from Concord, to be sure-the 'Knickerbocker,' 'Ladies' Companion,' 'Graham's Magazine,' and the ' North American Review!' I thought everything of having them for our tables-they will be so bare; nothing but the last 'Lady's Book,' two or three last papers, and a few annuals. We have no other volumes with pretty covers." "You can do as the Ambroses do, Fanny. 'T is in excellent taste. They put anything on their tables they happen to be reading, whether it has a pretty cover, or an ugly one, or none at all. This is so pleasant! -no trouble!" "Mamma, you do n't remember anything five minutes. I've told you a hundred times, that I sha'n't consider those Ambroses my authority in anything." Nor was the bustle of preparation confined to Mrs. Pens and Fanny; but, in degrees graduated chiefly by the fitness of the ladies' wardrobes, it extended to every house into which the little gilt edged missives of Mrs. Pons made their way. Mr. Clement, of Boscaven Plain, sat down in his easy-chair after dinner, to pick his teeth, more from a habit growing out of the possession of a silver tooth-pick, than anything else-and take solid comfort in read- ing the last "Patriot," before returning to his shop. Caroline followed him from the dining-room. "Do indulge me in this, papa!" said she, going up to him, and leaning over the back of his chair. He shook his head mechanically, and con- tinued reading. "Now, do n't shake your head in this solemn way, papa. You know I have n't drawn on your purse lately." "Humph! my books will assist me in coming to no such conclusions. -In May you had a new bonnet at eight dollars, in June a new dress at fifteen, besides handkerchiefs, cravats, collars, mits, gaiters, and--but I may as well stop; for their name is ' Legion.' Now you are teazing for another new dress. What is this, child, but drawing on my purse?" "( Well, papa, just think of the Smiths and Allens. Our wardrobe, with all these accessions, is almost shabby, compared with theirs; and you know Mr. Smith is bankrupt; and all Boscaven is agreed in this, that Mr. Allen would be as poor as the Kezars if his debts were all paid. But, for all this, Jane and Sarah are coming out at the Pons's in entire new suits." "The Smiths and Aliens are not our standards, you nonsensical chatterbox," replied Mr. Clement, without taking his eyes from his paper. He commenced reading aloud: ' This amalgamation of the Distribution and Tariff--'"   THE EASTERN STATES.            47 ,   Odo n't read that aloud!" interrupted Caroline, playfully covering his mouth with her hands. "I do positively hate the sound of ' Distribu. tion,"Tariff,'"and the hundred and one unmeaning political technicals that fill our papers lately. Just think!-to go out of town! so we ought to dress better. And those city people ;-mirabile! And Fanny Pens will expect us to make a pretty appearance; I know she will from what she wrote us." "Well, and what if she does? ' It was well known to the framers of this bill, that the President--'" his reading again became inaudible Caroline was in despairn She threw herself into a rocking-chair, and after hesitating a few moments between the two methods of relief, weep- ing and getting vexed, she decided to try neither; and so burst into a fit of laughter. "'And hence results, which must have been anticipated from the begin. ning-  ' Caroline, child, what is the matter?" "; Oh, dear! I am really vexed-just as much vexed as I can be, if 1 do laugh. Now, let me keep that paper while you think about these dresses, and say yes." "Does Lavinia want one?" "She do n't say so; but you know we must dress alike. And you know we shall be so much noticed as your daughters; and-and-do say yes, papa." "Yes, yes!" said Mr. Clement, in an impatient tone, as he threw down his paper and left the sitting-room. Lavinia met him at the door. "Going to your shop so soon, papa?" she asked. "Yes; I must go." His tone was melancholy; it sent a' momentary pang to the heart of Caroline-for though vain, she was not yet unfeeling. She wished that she had not insisted on such a sacrifice. But she thought of Fanny Pons's letter, of those interesting strangers, and her vanity resumed its customary sway over her better feelings. "Now, you will consent to this arrangement, 'Vinia, now that we have papa's approval?" Have you asked him to indulge us with those dresses, Caroline?" "Yes; and we are to have them. If Charles and Henry were here I would demand three cheers." "I must disappoint you, sister. I can't consent to so much unneces- sary expense on my account. I should n't take any comfort. No; if you have a dress, we must dress differently. I shall wear white." "Why, papa knows, surely, what he can afford us. Everybody says- he says himself-that he is adding to his property something every year." "Yes, a trifle; and he does it by abridging his own pleasures, and personal expenses, and by spending all his time; wearing himself out day by day, when he longs to spend a few hours each day in leisure    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6890-00000023"/> 48      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN reading, ana social intercourse. I know no reason why our fondness for dress should be gratified at such a price, Caroline." Lavinia's voice trembled; Caroline, too, was moved,%but not ready to relinquish her darling plan. "Well, 'Vinia, you know our intimate friends all dress richly. The Smiths, Aliens, arid Augusta Fitch, have no taste for the society of those who are not elegant every way. We may well afford some sacrifices to secure their friendship." "Friendship! pray do n't prostitute the term by such an appropriation. I would n't turn my hand for all the friendship in the world, whose price is fine clothes." "All theory, sis; let us peep at the practice of the thing. You have four or five, or six intimate friends. They are all of them elegant and fashionable. Some three or four of them are ultras. How does this happen, if elegance is not the sine qua non in your friends?" "Is Louisa fashionable?" "Yes ;-or-why, she is elegant, everybody knows." "Yes; because a noble soul shows itself in every look and movement. Does Susan Reed dress fashionably?" "Not exactly; but then she is independent. She don't care a fig what she wears, everybody knows. Yet, after all, she is fashionable; that is, she is the fashion. 'T is the mode to be like her." "But 't is not because she wears splendid dresses, or because' her style of manner is graceful and genteel. She is honored for her talent. And if she had none of this, I should love her for her goodness of heart, and admire her for her independence in dressing according to a correct taste, regulated by economy." "You do n't admire Catherine Kent. But she certainly has a good share of independence. She is compelling her dressmaker to hurry her- self into a consumption, for aught I know, that she may appear at the party in a buff nine-penny calico. Here is independence for you." "Independence! Caroline. Imposing all this trouble on her dress- maker and herself, just that she may make a figure by dressing oddly, since her purse will not allow her now, as formerly, to attract attention by dressing more richly than any other one. Independence, forsooth!" "Ha! I see it now. Well, my sister, we won't have those dresses; 't would be idle and, as you say, I should n't take any comfort. I should hear father's sorrowful ' Yes, yes,' all the evening. And what need we care what people think about us. They will like me quite as well as I deserve. I am going out to the shop this minute to tell papa. and bring him back to finish his paper. Only think, Lavinia! with the money papa would have had to pay for those dresses, he can hire George Bancroft two whole months. All that time papa can have to rest, or read the ' Patriot,' or do anything he pleases. And it will be such a help to poor George, now he is out of business, and his mother is so poor."   THE EASTERN STATES.            49 She hurried out of the room before fairly concluding the last sentence. In a few moments, she came back, half-laughing, half-crying, leading the happy Mr. Clement. He laughed, but ever and anon his eyes filled with tears of gratified emotion, as Caroline, with all the volubility and artlessness of a child, told him all she felt, and all she resolved. But he did not read the "Patriot." He spent the time until after tea, in pleasant chat with his daughters and his wife, who joined them soon after Mr. Clement's return to the house. After tea, they walked awhile in the- yard and garden; and then Mr. Clement went down to the widow Ban. croft's, to engage George's services, until he might find. a more lucrative situation for him. Lavinia and Caroline went to the party in simple white muslins. But were they not happy?-was not Caroline happy? Yes; happier than ever before in her happy life. So she told her father the morning after the fifth, as she kissed his forehead on entering the breakfast-room. And none were more admired, more sought after, than "the .sweet and intel. ligent Misses Clement, of Boscaven." Then the passport to popular favor, in country life, is not in rich or fashionable attire. No. The modest, pretty little Sara Herbert put her new white dress into excellent order, with a fall of rich blond in the bosom, gathered tastefully up in the front, with an artificial rose to try the effect-a natural one was to take its place on the Fourth. She took out the large bishop-sleeves, and tucked in some little beauties, all blond and puffs, coming not quite to the elbow. These were to be met, or nearly met, just as happened, by a pair of long, white, net mits. These same mits, and the blond likewise; were presented to Mrs. Herbert at the time of her marriage, by a rich uncle, formerly a sea-captain, but settled at that time in Newhuryport. But then recent pecuniary misfortunes, in which her father and lover were mutually involved, and her determina- tions to live within their means, induced her to forego her original plan of "-coming out bride;" and so she was married in her dark brown crape, and wore it to meeting on the following Sabbath, with her plain straw hat, just as if nothing had happened. "A good and sensible girl!" said all good and sensible people. Years of struggle with poverty followed; and when this gave way to competence, -and at length to wealth, Mrs. Herbert had become too matronly to appear in short sleeves. The mits and blond, therefore, had always lain in that same box, with a mirror under the lid, and a painted velvet cushion- on the top, until they were produced for Mrs. Pons's party. Fanny somehow ascertained that white was to be Sara's dress. "Too bad!" said she to her mother; "there is nothing so unfashionable! I will give her a hint of this. I suppose she don't know: she don't take the 'Lady's Book,' or read much besides her school-books." When Sara was passing Mrs. Pons's yard, on her way to school, Fanny chanced, doubtless, to be in the yard, propping a daha that did not at all need propping.    <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6890-00000024"/> 50      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN (' Good morning, Sara. Professor Bancroft says, anticipations of this party of ours have turned the heads of half the pupils; that a part of the ladies stay at home, and the rest do not get their lessons; and that the gentlemen, instead of spending recesses in their usual exercises, practice making bows, touching their foreheads, and smiling graciously. You are not of those who stay at home, it seems. I suppose you think, that * beauty unadorned, is adorned the most;' and so do not think it necessary to make any preparatory arrangements." Sara nodded and laughed. 'They say that the Gass girls are going to appear in white," continued Fanny, blushing: "I wish some one would tell them that it is the most obsolete of anything in the world. I am not particular how others dress- very; but I admire, above all things, evidences of good taste and fitness -the harmony is so agreeable!" Sara had her mother's good sense and independence. Of course, she lhad no scruples about wearing white, even after being informed that it was obsolete. Not so Abby Gass. She was informed, on FanDy's ipse dixil, that all, or all who were anything, were to wear silk, printed lawn, or mousseline de laine. She was in despair: 'twas late afternoon of the tlird ; and she was ironing the last puff when the tidings came. What could be done? Her sister had a new mousseline de laine that would meet her exigences finely; but she had only one alternative, and that a deplorable one. She would not wear white, that was certain-there was no time to make a new dress. "Alas!" said Abby; and "Good!" said her prudent papa. Accordingly, she must stay at home, or sit up nearly all night to refit a light silk. She settled upon the latter; worked until sleepy, fidgetty, tired, nervous, worn out, et cetera, etc., &amp;c.; and cried half a-dozen times at Gordian knots in her sewing-silk, impervious seams, and refractory plaits. At last, when assuring herself that her dress was so far renovated, that she would be able to finish it on the following morning, she found that she had put her sleeves in entirely wrong: they were of the coat-sleeve style, and the curve for the elbow came in the. hollow of the arm. Adeline thought it just as well to laugh as any way, though she did feel really troubled; so she told Abby that the dress would be an excellent fit for a skewered turkey. But Abby burst into a new fit of weeping, scolded Adeline-because she had been helping her all those long, late hours, it must be, for there was no other reason-then threw her dress on the floor, went to bed, and cried herself to sleep. Jeanette Eastman-no one ever described her without saying, "Good. natured-always looking on the bright side-happy, let what will come; but-  " Yes, there was always a but; and sometimes this little word was left to tell a long, mischievous story about sundry naughty freaks, "too numerous to mention;" and sometimes it was uttered as a sort of intelligible exordium to a discourse upon Miss Jeanette's faults. 'T is true, she was always looking on the bright side of things, when she troubled herself to look at all, which she did but seldom. Predetermined   THE EASTERN ST'ATES.           51 on laughing and being happy all the day long, if unpleasant reflections popped into her head, she had only to laugh the louder, sing the merrier, and rock the more industriously, to stifle, or banish them entirely. So she was good-natured; but the philosophic Mark of "Martin Chuzzlewit," would have said, "There's no credit in that: any man could be jolly in that way." Jeanette abhorred exertion above all things. She romped and rested through the day, wondering how her sister Emeline ever could get out of patience. By the way, Emeline was as busy as a bee-always careful, and sometimes, it must be confessed, troubled; but a hundredth part of tfie toils and cares she bore without complaining, would have completely annihilated patience and every other virtue in Jeanette's list. Virtue, indeed! After all, Mark was not so very foolish:-"What would be the credit of the landlord of the Dragon's being jolly? Why, he could n't help it if he tried." When a card of invitation reached the Eastmans, and many times afterward, Jeanette had glimmering convictions that her dress was out of system. She remembered something about getting an oil-spot on her best silk, and hanging it up somewhere without cleaning it-it must be in the attic; fai- had not seen it since. But this was amazing, and she would think no more about it: as a preventive, she commenced laughing at Emeline for being so nice as to put her hair in papers, just for Fanny Pons's party.. But time for dressing came, and she could no longer defer investigations of her wardrobe. Her silk was first produced; but, mercy! the oil had spread itself far and wide where it fell, and, be. sides, communicated itself to other parts that came in contact. It was a beautiful thing-had been worn only once-Emeline had one just like it; but, then, there was no use in thinking about it-" what could n't be cured must be endured." She next sent little Susan after her lawn, while she set herself to finding cravat, mits, handkerchief, &amp;c. She found the first, at length, after rummaging boxes, drawers, and baskets to no purpose, on the floor of her closet-" mixed up, as true as you live, Emeline, mixed up with as many as half-a-dozen pairs pf shoes and dirty stockings," said she, laughing, as she held up the soiled and crumpled thing. "I suppose I hung it up, and it fell down." "Why, there are feathers hanging with the rest of the dirt," said Em- eline. "Yes; I swept the dirt from my chamber in there this morning, I was in such a hurry. What shall I do, Emeline? 'T is time that we were half dressed." Just then Susan came in with Jeanette's dress, laughing so that she could scarcely walk. She held her mouth with one hand, to avoid laugh- ter; for she probably thought there was quite as much reason for crying as laughing. With her other hand, she had dragged Jeanette's lawn from the attic, treading on it at one step, and at the next, gathering it up into i lump.    <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6890-00000025"/> 52      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN You can't wear it, Netty, any more than---. When cousins were here, we went up into the attic; and this dress hung up on the higi bed- post, just as it does on you, Netty, when you have it on. This made us think of rag-babies--I '1 tell you: and so we did have such a good time! We made a baby out of a pillow, and put this on like this;" and she held up the baby. "Oh, mercy!" said Jeanette. "Don't it look like Netty, Emeline?" asked Susan, still laughing, and mounting a chair, so as to give room for the full flow of the dress. "I 'll leave it to you. See, Emeline! See, Netty! 'T is pinned upat the bot- tom, because baby stepped on it at every step. 'T is half open in the back, because baby was too fat; and 't is just the way you were, Netty, all last winter; and see the dirt, here, and here, and there, and there." Emeline was really concerned. Jeanette could have cried easily, but that would have been unpleasant; and accordingly she went from the room laughing, in quest of another dress, begging Emeline to find some. thing among her things for her-Jeanette's-neck. After a short search, she returned with her arm full of dresses. Emeline saw their condition at a glance, and looked at Jeanette as if discouraged to death, almost. Then Jeanette would have cried, certainly; but the mischievous little Sue fell to laughing, jumping, and clapping her hands with all her might, and Jeanette soon laughed too. "Ha, ha, ha! I 'll leave it to you, Emeline-don't they hang on Net's arm just like old granny Bruce's mop-rag, dish-cloth, and ragged towel? hla, ha! ha, ha!" Emeline's fears were not all relieved upon examination, One dress- made by Jeanette herself-was badly ripped; another was minus hooks and eyes; and another-Susan took up the inspection: "Yes, Jeanette; and another is dirty, and another is soiled, and another is nasty." 'T was strange! passing strange! but Jeanette was really so much moved as to order Susan out of the room. She peeped through the door, after once closing it after her: "You 'll be sorry, Netty; you see if you ain't. You 'll want me to go into the attic for your shoes; into mamma's room for combs and brush; to the kitchen, or back-room, or Henry's room; or somewhere, for curling- irons; to the attic for your stockings, and to the cellar for your pocket handkerchief; ha, ha!' you see if you do n't, Netty." The sound of her light footstep had no more than left the stairs, when Jeanette did want her to look all over the house for her embroidered hand- kerchief, and the curling-irons. A dress had been selected. It was very objectionable, Emeline thought; but Jeanette declared-and in all honesty -that she would quite as lief wear that as any; and in the merriest mood conceivable, she commenced making her. toilet. And so it was-the same trait of temperament that caused all her neglects, led to easy and perfect reconciliation to their unpleasant results. On this occasion they   THE EASTERN STATES.            53 afforded often amusement. The dress was a very light sort of gauze, purchased the previous season for a ball. It was toril in many places, near the bottom; so she gathered it up with bunches of artificial flowers, to conceal the rents. But she might about as well let them go without this effort at concealment; for she amused herself, and almost every fun. loving girl in the rooms,.by telling them how she was plagued, and how she managed. CHAPTER X. FRANK HOWARD, Mr. Ambrose's guest, was, as Mrs. Pons "believed," the son of Mrs. Ambrose's old school-companion, Miss Marshall. He as- signed himself a year for travel, before entering upon the duties of his profession., He spent the preceding winter and spring at the south and west, and now he had come thus far on his tour north. His plan was, to spend some weeks in New-Hampshire, with the Ambroses, at the capital, and in visiting the mines, lakes, and mountains of the State; thence to proceed by way of Saratoga, Niagara, and the lakes to the Canadas. Mrs. Howard wrote by him: "Bitter-bitter has been the cup my heavenly Father gave me to drink. If you sympathized withme, my beloved friend, in the imaginary trials of my girlhood, how would your wife's and mother's heart bleed for mine now! Once, twice, thrice, has my heart been almost crushed in the closing of its portals,' as some beloved being went out from life. No wonder, then; that it beats thus* wildly, now that its all is about to wander. Yet my better judgment consents to his plan, even approves it; but repeated trials have made me a weak, timid woman; and I tremble for him and for myself, lest he too fall as suddenly as his father. He was engaged in a suit of no-common interest. His client was a husband and father-a most worthy man, my husband knew; but by a tangled web of unfortunate contingencies, he, stood convicted of nurder. Mr. Howard's sympathies were all aroused'; evidences against him were so strong and so apparent, that he was almost in despair; he seemed to think that all depended on himself; and in a most thrilling appeal to judge, jury and citizens, he burst a blood-vessel, and was brought home to my arms a corpse. For weeks I was a maniac. Meanwhile, my little daughter Fanny was consigned to a wet nurse, whose husband had lately rented one of our small houses. Here sie was seized with an epidemic, which, in a few hours, laid her beautiful head in the dust. Her nurse appeared inconsolable, on account of her dread of my displeasure, or, perhaps, of her fears about the effects of this new trial on my health. She took her own child, about the age of my Fanny, and with her husband started for the West. When my reason returned, I opened'my eyes, and Frank was bending over me. As recol- 4    <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6890-00000026"/> 54      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN lections of the death of my husband gradually recurred to me, at first wilh shadowy indistihctness, and then in all their horrible reality, I flung my arms round poor Frank's neck, and wept long upon his bosom. There, for the first time in my life, I prayed; and oh! what answers of peace came to me. I inquired for my little son and daughter; but the looks and evasive answers of my attendants, led me to anticipate some- illinf dreadful. Yet I did not shrink. 'Tell me all-I can bear any. thing' said I; but still they hesitated. 'The cup that my heavenly Father giveth me, shall I not drink it ' Oh! how those blessed words thrilled my heart. Frank, too, seemed to feel their inspiration. There was a new light in his eye, as, full of tears, he raised it to Heaven. He fervently clasped his hands and knelt at my bedside in prayer. In a few low and broken words, I was told of my new trial. I wonder now, often as I have proved the efficacy of prayer-I wonder that it sustained me so then-me, a mere babe, as it were, in grace. I came out from these afflictions a lowly woman; weak, indeed, in flesh, but strong in spirit. In a few months, my little son died; but 1 blessed God con- tinually through his short sickness, and when he lay before me, 'beau- tiful in death ;' for my own arm had supported him, my own hand had nursed him, smoothed his pillow, and closed his trembling eyelids to their last sleep. That my husband and daughter died under circumstances that deprived me of this dear privilege, was then, and is even now, the bitterest drop in my cup. I will except, indeed, some horrible suspicions that have lately been infused into my mind, by a woman who was our nurse's near neighbor, at the time of Fanny's death. They are, that it Was ler child, instead of mine, that died. I can scarcely conceive this possible; yet fears of their truth, and that my daughter still lives, sub- ject to all the evil influences, all the privations and toils of a woman in her nurse's situation, andccapable of such baseness as this of which she is suspected, crush me to the earth. "You will not accuse me of superstition, dear Mrs. Ambrose; yet I confess I scarcely exonerate myself. I saw my son go to the perils of the south and west with scarcely a pang; such were my convictions of duty. But now I cannot shake off the impression, that important results, either of good or evil, will come of his northern adventures. Please detain him as long as possible with you, that he may have the less time to spend in strange places." Much more she wrote; but these extracts are sufficient. The arrival of young Howard at Mr. Ambrose's, was greeted with the most cordial welcome by the whole family: for his mother's sake'by the colonel and his wife, and for his own, to be sure, by the girls. Caro- line thought him noble, and handsome, and gallant enough for days ot chivalry. Miss Graham thought him the most charming person she ever saw, except-except Harry. As to Jane, she said nothing; but evidently not for fear of clashing in opinion. And yet, on a second thought, this might be; for when her father led her into the room where Mr. Howard   THE EASTERN STATES.           55 was standing to receive her, she certainly did put on an air of cool civil- ity, equally interesting and unusual in her. And that evening, when she found there was danger of being left alone with him, by the deser- tisn of the rest of the party-Mrs. Ambrose had gone to see to the ways of her household; the colonel to draw up a check on the Concord bank, for a neighbor; Caroline to wait upon their help, who had just returned from the other farm; Harry and Miss Graham somewhere, and for some purpose, nobody knew what, or where-and when Frederic rose and asked to be excused, &amp;c., Jane, too, rose in some trepidation, and asked Frederic if he could not fulfil their father's promise to Mr. Howard. "Papa promised to show you the conservatory at sunset, sir," said Jane, blushing slightly. "But he won't be released in season, and Fred will accompany you. The arrangement of the flowers is such, as to be much more effective at this hour." Mr. Howard rose with many thanks. All this time Fred had been framing a suitable reply. "I am really sorry, Mr. Howard; but, Jennie, you know I am en- gaged at-our debating-rooms this evening. It wants but two minutes of the hour. But this is your time for a walk; I appoint you my vice." With a bow and laugh he left the room. Mr. Howard, too, smiled and turned to Jane, holding his hat, which Fred had just handed him. Again Jane blushed; and to get away from his glance, which she thought must be like the eagle's, judging from what she had read and guessed about such matters, she ran from the room, saying something about bringing her bonnet. She sought Mr. Ambrose and Caroline, but they were still engaged; Harry and Miss Graham, but they wer, not to be found. Therefore, perforce, she returned alone to conduct Xl:. Il..vard; and, although she was so apprehensive about it, she did not find the walk so very unpleasant. They had not left the piazza, before, under the influences of the hour, the scene, and Mr. Howard's vivacity and finished politeness, she felt as much at repose as if they had always " been friends together." "Miss Ambrose, what is the reason you are not a poetess? You cannot want themes, or moments of inspiration, here," said Mr. Howard, as they paused before a decayed, but majestic and "brave old oak;" and de- clared its " waste more rich than other" trees' "fertility." "No; but-I can't tell you how it is; I don't understand it myself. But when I allow myself to feel at all, I am completely beside myself. I look at the clouds as we see them now, Mr. Howard, in the west; and -in the buoyancy of my spirit, I feel as though I might fly 'through their golden vistas into Heaven.' The stars seem to look into my very heart; and I long to veil my face before them. The flowers-are thrillingly elo- quent; but a mere confusion of tongues, perfectly untranslatable into our clumsy English. All this is something like the state of the mind in composition, as described by d'Israeli.. You will recollect his extract from Dryden, in allusion to his work-' When it was only a confused    <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6890-00000027"/> 56      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN mass ot thoughts, trembling over one another in the dark; when the fancy was yet in its first work, moving the sleeping images of things to. ward the light, there to be distinguished, and then either to be chosen or rejected by the judgment.' The comparison fails indeed in one important point. My judgment does not come to its office of choice and rejection. Doubtless it is frightened into some dark, out-of-the-way corner, by the tumbling of thoughts over one another; and by the racket fancy makes in 'moving the sleeping images toward the light.'" Mr. Howard laughed heartily. "Perhaps Byron would meet your case more exactly: 'We gaze and turn away, and know not when, Dazzled and drunk with beauty, till the heart Reels with it fulnes.' " "Yes; that is just the way I feel. My heart does reel; my limbs tremble, my brain whirls; there is a weight at my heart-of pleasure; yet it is too oppressive to be borne; and when such spells come upon me in our walks, I seek relief In some way,-by listening to Dr. Baldwin's dissertations on'the effects, physical and intellectual, of evening ram- blos, or On epidemic throats, if such there are, And coughs, and rheums, and phthisics, and catarrhs ;' or to Miss Pons's abstract of the last novel or love-tale, ' And in the saddest part cry-Drol, indeedl' Anything is a relief."  Mr. Howard again smiled at the earnestness and simplicity with which she spoke. Jane blushed, dropped his arm, and stooped, ostensibly to pluck a flower that blossomed by the path. In a moment they reached the conservatory. The mute admiration and delight with which Mr. Howard gazed upon the plants, and then turned to Jane, were the most flattering expressions he could give of his surprise and pleasure. "Oh! how beautiful is this world of ours, Miss Ambrose! and how good!" he exclaimed, at length, as he offered his arm to Jane, on turning away from the conservatory. "And how we should love Him, the might of whose finger made all these beauties, and whose love watches over the least of his children!" Jane made no reply; but her eyes were eloquent enough, as, swim- ming in tears, she raised them to his. Days passed away in the most delightful intercourse at Mr. Ambrose's. Mr. Howard found the keennest delight in spending a part of each fore. noon with the men in the fields ;and Miss Graham, in assisting the females in their household avocations. She never tired in rocking the churn, putting the house in order, replenishing the flower-vases, feeding   THE EASTERN STATES.            57 the poultry, hunting eggs on the new hay, or assisting Mrs. Ambrose in the dairy, and Alice in the kitchen, as often as they would permit. Fanny Pons thought her one of those girls, who are "born to love pigs and chickens." She sat hours, one day, in her chamber, looking through the closed blind, to see Harry swing his scythe and rake the newly- mown hay into furrows. Then, and often, she went to the field with a pitcher of cold water, a basket of strawherries, she had gathered for that purpose in a little field back of the house, and a bunch of flowers for each. The colonel drank the water, and ate the plums with avidity; but he always laughed at the flowers. Ellenora would put them in the button-holes of his jacket, or under the land of his broad-brimmed hat, blowever; and he evidently wore them with as much pleasure as Mr. Howard and his sons, except Harry! Never was there a happier family than Mr. Ambrose's., A pure and" simple system of dietetics, while it secured to them almost perfect enjoy- ment of physical and mental strength and vigor, left for the ladies ample leisure for social intercourse, and literary pursuits. And in an equal degree, perhaps, it lessened the toils of the gentlemen, by decreasing the family expenditures, and the necessity of unceasing exertion to meet them. Mr. and Mrs. Ambrose seemed to forget that they were old, their children and guests that they were young; and they all met on the same ground. Together they discussed grave subjects, laid and executed plans of benevolence, and entered upon many of those innocent amuse- ments, which, in the country, are usually appropriate to the young only. Every day and every hour brought for them some new delights. -For these, and for their high capacities for enjoying them, the good colonel's gratitude often choked his utterance, when at evening he knelt amid his family, and gave thanks to Heaven for the mercies of the day. To Jane, "the rosy hours" seemed to have redoubled the speed of their flight since Mr. Howard's arrival at Franklin. She seemed in a very paradise of delights and beauties-why, she neither knew nor cared. Mr. Howard was to her ever, as "some bright, particular star;" just, noble, and good; and talented enough for her good and sensible sister Caroline. And she doubted not that he was of the same opinion; for, while he did sing, and read, and laugh, and walk with her, he sat down quietly with Caroline to long and earnest discussions of science, poetry, religion, &amp;c. &amp;c. Jane felt a real interest in such subjects; and she had never been backward in their discussion until recently. But Mr. Howard watched her so earnestly when she spoke, seemed so anxious to call out her opinions, listened so eagerly to them when given, was so faithful-and yet tender-in correcting them when he thought them erro- neous, especially upon religious subjects, that she seldom ventured to utter a sentiment of sufficient importance to excite interest, or challenge correction, after the first few days of their intercourse. One evening, they had been reading Mrs. Hemans's poems together,    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6890-00000028"/> 58      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN "Beautiful! beautiful as music!" exclaimed Jane, quite involuntarily, as Mr. Howard finished one of the sweetest passages. With all the delights of her soul beaming in her face, she turned to him as she spoke. Again she met that very peculiar expression of his, which never failed to frighten her almost out of her senses-it was so full of meaning, so blissful, tender, and, it seemed to her, affectionate. Yet, it could not be; or, yes, he might love her as the sister of his Caroline. Jane bent her eyes, blushed, and sighed, as these thoughts flitted through her brain. Mr. Howard's eyes were fixed upon her expressive face; and for a mo- ment he was too much occupied with his speculations, if such there were, to answer. "Yes, beautiful indeed!" aat an observer would have sworn that Jane Ambrose was his " nominative case independent, understood," instead of Mrs. Hemans's poem. "But, Miss Ambrose why do you keep all these, your best thoughts and feelings, to yourself, unless they escape from you involuntarily? Let me be to you as your own brothers, dear Miss Ambrose; let there be no reserves between us. Promise me that you will speak every thought as you did at first." "Ah! 'as my own brothers;' even as. I knew," thought Jane. Her embarrassment fled instantly; and with all the mischief of her nature, or rather of her habit, she looked up in his face and laughed. "Ah, Mr. Howard, you do n't know how much your love of approbation and self- esteem might be shocked, if I were to tell you how much better I like Baldwin, and Pons, and Gass, than I do you. However, I promise; and, quid pro quo, promise me on the virtue of our new relationship, that you will call me Jane, Jennie, or Jin, as you please. 'Tis not at all bro- therly to Miss Ambrose me in this manner. Call me Jane when I am 'out of order,' and you wish to reprove me; Jennie, when you like or pity me; and Jin, when I am so very vicious as to displease you thoroughly. Do you promise compliance?"Again she laughed. It was so dark where Mr. Howard sat, that she could not see the effect of her reply; but he sighed, and she heard that. She was about to apolo. gize for answering his appeal so carelessly, when they heard the tones of the piano and Caroline's voice in another room. Mr. Howard rose. "Yes, I will promise anything you wish. But come, Jennie," he added, with a forced smile, as he extended his hand to her-" come; let us go and sing with your sister." "Yes," thought Jane; "he finds me fit only for a toy; while, for rational enjoyment, he flies to Caroline. Well, he knows 't is my nature to be gay; and I sha' n't alter my course at all to suit him." These re- flections made our little Jennie look stately and proud, as she approached Caroline. But all unpleasant feelings fled under the influences of Caro- line's affectionate welcome, and of the music; and she was as lively as ever. She saw that Mr. Howard was not; and she felt that his thought- fulness arose in part, if not in whole, from her folly. "I wish he would   THE EASTERN STATES.            59 declare h mself to Caroline at once. Then I should know just what he means wIen he looks and speaks so tenderly to me, and takes care of me so like a careful mother." So thought Jane, as she sat with her eyes fixed on his fine form. He was bending over some music Caroline was examining. "Heigh-ho!" said she, with a long, low sigh, sauntering out into the piazza. She sat there long, listening to the village band sailing on the river; and when she returned to the sitting-room, How- ard and Caroline were sitting together, in low and earnest conversation. She heard Caroline say, "But Sidney won't think so." She blushed when Jane entered; but Jane laughed, shook them heartily by the hand, and took them out to hear a beautiful march, Caroline's favorite. Sidney was leader of the band before going west; and the band observed that he always ordered that air, when sailing or marching near Colonel Am- brose's. They soon understood and respected the cause of this; and now that he was absent, this custom seemed sacred in the estimation of his associates, to whom he had endeared himself by his talent, 1is good- ness of heart, and his kind exertions for their comfort and improvement. It was therefore resolved that it should be retained until Sidney's u. How Caroline was affected by the romance and generosity of the iing, '. it doth not now appear ;" for she generally managed to be in the r1oom when she heard the band approaching. Jane saw, by the nature of Howard's and Caroline's intercourse, sub- sequent to that evening, that they had come to a perfect understanding. She wondered Caroline did not tell her of her happiness. She was quite sure she could not have kept hers from Caroline a minute, under such circumstances. She wondered how poor Sidney, or Sid, they always called him, would bear her fickleness. But then it was not strange that she should prefer Howard; he was so good, and gentle, and handsome, dignified-so much like Caroline herself. Her reflections on the subject were many, and rather sad; yet, on the whole, she felt relieved. She now understood the cause of his tenderness toward her, and of his zeal in all th"t concerned her improvement and happiness. Her eyes no longer fell beneath his; she no longer feared to do as he desired, to speak every thought ard feeling; and she could not deny to herself that the hours she spent alone with him, in the full interchange of thoughts and emotions, were the happiest of her life. She loved to lean on his arm, to feel his breath upon her cheek; and no music was half so sweet to her as his voice. Still, in spite of herself, she grew listless and melan) choly. She cared for no amusements which he was not to share ^i her. When singing, site stopped, held her breath to, listen to his fl rich tones; and sweeter to her was reproof from Howard, accompanied by his evident solicitude for her peace, than the gayest flatteries of her gayest friends. While things were in this situation, there came invitations to Mrs. Pons's party.    <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6890-00000029"/> 60      JENNY AMBROSE: OR, LIFE IN CHAPTER XI. 'TII night of nights came at last, and "all the fashion and all the literati," were at Mrs. Pons's. Mr. Howard and Jane were standing near a table, with a party of friends. Suddenly Howard touched Jane's arm. "See! who is that beautiful girl?" "There are many beautiful girls present, Howard," answered Jane, drawing herself up with pretended pique. At the same time, her eyes followed his to a tall, beautiful girl-beautiful indeed-and her appear- atnce was rendered the more interesting by her evident struggles with tilmility. Mrs. Pons was introducing her to her daughter and others. "Why, it must be Miss Hayes; she is attended by Mr. Flanders," sail Jane. "Yes;  Miss Hayes,' Mrs. Pons names her. But now, Iloward, I forbid any falling in love, in the name of-of---" She looked round for Caroline, but she had fled. ' iHow much-how much like my mother!" exclaimed Howard, with hs eves still riveted on her face. "She is an elegant creature," said Jane. "Can it be Miss Hayes? You know Mrs. Pons told us she was pretty, but ignorant-totally un- tsJld to society; uncouth in dress-she feared we would feel her pres- ence here an intrusion. This young lady's eyes are full of intelligence -and she has a perfect head-she can't be ignorant. And how grace. fully she is carrying herself through the tangled web of etiquette, in whch Mrs. Pons has involved her, by her well-meant, but unseasonable officiousness. But she is timid, isn't she, Howard? And no wonder; for almost every eye in the room is on her. I suppose Mrs. Pons gave all Franklin the same picture she left at our house. But, Howard, I -ha 'n't talk to you any more, until you come out of the spell under which this ' ladve Taire' has thrown you." "Pardon me, my good Jennie; but this resemblance astonishes me," said Mr. Howard, with a smile and bow, as he offered his arm to Jane for a promenade. He again turned to Miss Hayes. "Her form, her fea- tures, her movements-and her voice!" He started, as her tones in speaking to Mrs. Pens, reached his ear. Mrs. Pons saw them, and hur- riedly made her way through the intervening crowd. "I have been looking for you, Jane-or Jennie I love to call you, it sounds so much more social-ever since Miss Hayes and Mr. Flanders entered the rooms. Do you know, Jane, I have pitched upon you for my sub lady-patroness, in this affair of ingratiating Miss Hayes? Where are Caroline and Miss Graham?" "They have lately left us, in company with Harry." Av, yes; they have gone to the sitting-room, doubtless; Fanny is at the piano. How pleasant it is! 'tis so delightful to see all one's friends   THE EASTERN STATES.            6! together, and to see them so happy!--Miss Hayes,"-and here she low- ered her voice to a confidential whisper-" isn't she a charming crea- ture?-so pleasant!-strange!-brought up in the woods with toads, and bears, and bearish people. I didn't wonder so much when I saw her in that odd, terrible dress; but now, how richly she is dressed! Mr. Gale says-and as a jeweller, he is a correct judge, no doubt-he says that one jewel she wears in her bosom, did not cost less than twenty-five dollars; he doubted if it did less than fifty. Ah! her mother is an odd woman. But may 1 have the pleasure of making you acquainted with Miss Hayes?" Thank you," answered Jane; "but we will wait until an introduc- tion can be brought about, without such direct efforts as would be neces- sary to bring us together through this crowd, Will this do, Mrs. Pons?" Oh, yes; any way to please you, and make your visit here agree- able. She is a delightful creature, if she is old Mrs. Hayes's daughter." "Yes; and I shall be happy to meet her, as soon as I can without disturbing her." "Yes ;-well, that is right-just like you-always kind and consider- ate. You have no fears of'rivalry here, of course." She laughed, and nodded her head at Mr. Howard's heart, as she spoke. "No; I see by that eye of yours, that you feel safe; and well you may, for Mr. How- ard is not blind." "Indeed, I sha'n't stay to be flattered in this way, Mrs. Pons," said Jane, slightly blushing. "There: now they are approaching us, in- troduce us, if you please." Mrs. Pons complied; and after many assurances made to each party, that they would be mutually delighted with each other, she left them. If Howard and Jane had been astonished at Maria Hayes's beauty, they were still more so at her sweetness, intelligence, and dignity. The easy familiarity of Howard's and Jane's manner, unmixed as It was, with evident efforts at extraordinary condescension, won her esteem and con- fidence at once; and made her forget that she was ignorant, unused to society, &amp;c., &amp;c. Or, this did occur to her once, when giving an opinion. She blushed slightly, and cast a troubled look about her, as if for an avenue of escape from all eyes. But immediately reassured by the politeness of her companions, she was again betrayed into an utterance of every sentiment. She spoke of her ignorance of society, and of books; of the delight she felt at every new accession of knowledge; and. of the discouragement, she sometimes felt, when she looked forward to what she had got to do, to fit herself for the society she most coveted. Her eyes filled as she spoke; and Jane, too, was affected. She threw her arm round her waist, and kissed her cheek. "Why, my dear Miss Hayes, we should all love you for your sweet candor; and-and--why, for a hundred other things, even if you were the inferior being you think you are. But-and yet I sha'n't tell you what I think about it; for it would disturb you, and confirm Howard's    <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6890-00000030"/> 62      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN opinions of my extemporan;eous enthusiasm. Were those the right words, Howard? Yet, Miss Hayes, I do love you just as if you were my own sister;-now, Howard, and Mr. Flanders, you are laughing at me, but I don't care;-and, Miss Hayes, I shall be just as happy as a bird, if you will come to our house every day; call for me when you want to walk, and tell me all about it, when you are sad and discouraged. We have a plenty of good books and pleasant company at our house. And if in any. thing I have the advantage of you, Miss Hayes, I owe it to these, not to any worth or worthiness of my own." In Jane's earnestness, she had forgotten that she had an auditor ex- cepting Maria. Her cheeks glowed, her eyes sparkled in the warmth and light of her affectionate enthusiasm; and she pressed Maria closer and still closer to her side. Maria was too happy and grateful for words; but her eyes were eloquent erough, as she turned them, full of tears, to Jane. It was a pretty picture; and so thought the Messrs. Howard and Flanders. Their eyes were yet turned on the lovely actors, when Caro- line joined them. She was followed by Miss Graham, who was dragging Fanny Pons through the crowd, attended by Professor Bancroft, and several gay young creatures. ' We shall set you down for in incorrigible truant, my dear Caroline," said Howard. My dear Caroline," repeated Jane, mentally. She thought she had never seen Howard look so happy as at that mo- nent-and all because Caroline had returned, after an absence of half an hour. There was a world of unhappiness in the thoughts that rushed through her mind in an instant. They were banished immediately, how- ever, with many self-reproaches for their indulgence. It was invariably so with Jane, that efforts to throw off sadness, were followed by a wild rayety, whose degree was graduated by the depth of the despondency that preceded them. So it was now. Far were those who watched her ani- mated manner from suspecting that feelings had just been driven from her heart, so sad, so degrading, that, for a moment, she almost longed to be freed for ever from their recurrence. And so it is: there is scarcely a human heart that does not endure human suffering, of some sort; and yet the man who rolls in wealth, the woman who flaunts in satins, and the young lady who laughs gayly in public, are looked up to with envy, by those very persons, who, but for the indulgence of this passion, would be, perhaps, happier than they. ("Who shall decide when doctors disagree?' I suppose you will ask," said the laughing Miss Graham, as she joined her friends. ",I will state the question between Miss Pons and myself, and upon whose decision Professor Bancroft is vibrating: Whose life is the happiest-that of the city or village belle, or of that nearly extinct species of bipeds, the retired shepherdess? On the strength of my own enjoyments, I contelid for the former, while Miss Pons--"   THE EASTERN STATES.            63 ,( Yes; I am for the romantic and unsophisticated pleasures of the rural shepherdess." "And now, fellowcitizens, please help the professor out of his statu quo by exhibiting the pro and con." "Miss Pons, I suppose your ideal of a shepherdess wears a dress of white muslin, with its skirt tastefully ga red up at the bottom by bouquets of flowers," said Jane; " her arms and neck, although constantly exposed to sun and wind, are as white as alabaster; she has roses and lilies for lips, cheeks, and brow; a row of pearls for teeth, and two ' bright par- ticular stars' for eyes. Her golden hair flows in long natural tresses, only partially confined by a wreath of wild flowers. On these, rests with careless and perfectly inimitable grace, a light hat, trimmed with roses, and veiled with gossamer-web." "Always providing that these flowers are culled, wreathed, and arranged by the loved hand of some youthful, tender shepherd, while sitting oni the greensward, gemmed with fragrant flowers; and beneath trees of deep poetic shade, filled with birds, pouring their sweetest notes," said Mr. Flanders, catching the tone of Jane's merriment. "Oh! a beautiful picture your combined talent has drawn!" exclaimed Miss Pons. "It shall be my model when I turn shepherdess." "Ah! and it is but a picture, Miss Pons," replied Jane, laughing. "Ha! I have you in my mind's eye now, Miss Pons. You are running in great distress, after two sheep which you suppose to be lost. You know if they are, you will be compelled to submit to a violent scolding when you return home; and, besides, lose the linsey-woolsey dress of which you have promise, with'the proviso that you take good care of the sheep. You have made your way through furze, and broom, and heather, until your faded, soiled, short-skirted, home-made, check dress is all in tatters. In attempting to leap a brook, you do not clear it quite, and one foot is immersed in the water. You then take off your-wet shoeand carry it in your hand, while its mate retains its place solely by strings of leather or eel-skin, which are tied round your ankle. Your arms and neck are bare and sunburnt. Your cross, gipsy-looking face is partially guarded from the sun's rays by an old palm-leaf bonnet, whose strings are frag- ments of an old red silk handkerchief, which you found one time when going to a far-off village with a basket of eggs to sell, and which you think prodigiously fine. There is a bunch of bows of the same material on the side of the crown. Well, while running on over hill and dingle, crying 'Cana!' you attempt to rush through a bed of flags, utterly reck- less of consequences in your desperation. You are lured on by two rocks of quartz, which you mistake for sheep. You suddenly find yourself in- extricably stuck in a quagmire; and naturally concluding that the Fates are all against you, you commence crying with all your remaining strength. At last a gentleman, a student of a far-off institute-who, by-the-by, has a notion that it is vastly beneficial to his health to kill himself walking, and who occasionally makes a few rhymes about rural sights, rural    <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6890-00000031"/> "      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN sounds, and rural maids-is attracted by your cries and rushes to the spot, with glorious anticipations of enrolling his name with that of Richard Cceur de Leon, and other knights-errant of the olden time. He calls his Sancho Panza to his aid, in the shape of a great black-and-white Bose, which the student has tried in vain to persuade his matter-of fact father to call Fido, and his matter-of-fact mother to use for a lap-dog. He is at a loss to conjecture what the cause of your distress may be; but he finds himself thinking of forced elopements, attacks of panthers, Italian ban- ditti, and Turkish marauders; and frames a dozen poems, ere he is level- led from his Parnassus, by coming round a nook near you. By means of his walking-stick, he and Bose succeed in getting you once more on terra firma ; and the poor fellow makes his bow to you, determined, in his heart, to think no more about rural maids." All laughed at Jane's picture-none more gayly than herself. But her heart was heavy; and she caught an opportunity, while Professor Ban. croft was rendering his verdict, to escape. She made her way to a win- dow, and sat down in its deep seat, completely concealed from observation by the long curtains. How grateful to her agitated feelings this retire. rnent! "For whom are you looking, Miss Graham?" she heard Mrs. Pons say, in passing. "Why, Jennie, surely!" replied Miss Graham, her voice almost choked with laughter. I am in haste to warn her of her danger; for her king- dom, I do believe, is to be divided and given to the Medes and Persians, alias Caroline and Miss Hayes. There, see. Mrs. Pens! Mr. Flanders has returned to claim Miss Hayes; and now Howard is pouring nice sayings into Caroline's willing ear. Mrs. Pens, do help me to find Jennie! For the first time this evening, I am entirely out of mischief. I have been trying to plague Mr. Baldwin; but he is perfectly invulnerable. His self-esteem makes him -" Here her voice was lost in the distance. Jane again gave herself up to her melancholy reveries, from which she waKsoon startled in a most painful manner. "Ah me!" exclaimed Miss Gass, who, it seemed, had heard the pre- ceding conversation, "I guess Miss Graham need n't worry herself. Alice told Mrs. Gould, Mrs. Gould told Miss Norton, when she was nere, and Miss Norton told me, that Mr. Howard and Caroline Ambrose are ep- gaged. She had overheard something between some of them, Miss Nor- ton said Mrs. Gould supposed. At any rate, she was very sure about it. And any one might know, if they know anything, that Mr. Howard would n't marry such a witch cat as Jane." "Perhaps so," answered one, in whom Jane recognized Mrs. Baldwin. She would have left her retreat; but she could not bring herself to af interruption so unpleasant as this would be, both to herself and them. "Perhaps so; but Jane is a clever girl, I always thought. I have always been in hopes she would marry our John-his edication is so good!   THE EASTERN STATES.            65 We've spent more than a hundred aoiiars on him since his poor father died; ,and he is going to be a doctor so-is studying along with Harry Ambrose-and often at the colonel's:-I was really in hopes it would be a match." "La! I don't see what makes everybody think so much of those Am- brose girls. They are nothing more than common, after all." "No; so I have told mamma a hundred times. She almost worships them," interrupted Fanny Pons, who had just joined them. "Oh dear!" exclaimed Miss Gass, tossing her head and curling her little nose in infinite disgust. , "I like Caroline best-Jane is so rude! I always feel as if she were laughing at me." "I am superior to suspicions of this sort," said FaOny, " but I dislike her style of manner. I wish she would read 'The Young Ladies' Friend,' and the 'Young Ladies' Own Book,' and others of the same character that I have read: I think she would be more circumspect." "Why, I don't know," said Mrs. Baldwin, meekly. "John thinks there is nobody like her, or half so good, or so handsome. I hope Mr. Howard will marry Caroline." "He won't marry Jane; so you may be satisfied on that score," replied the amiable Miss Gass. "He talks about her being so pert and forward. He says she is much too fond of him for his enjoyment there." Mrs. Baldwin bit her lip. "Too fond of him, did he say? Well, I must tell John of this, and he will look around him a little sharper. I told him, says I, 'This Mr. Howard is so handsome, and rich, and such a favorite with the colonel and his wife, you'd best offer at once;' but John seemed to think nobody could cut him out. Do you really think she is fond?" "Why, yes," answered Miss Pens; "one can see it in every glance, tone, and movement, When they are together. Yet that he prefers Caro- line, is equally evident. So Miss Jane may as well make up her mind to exchange the myrtle for the willow; and I hope it will prove a civil- izing process." "Hut tut, girls!" said Mr. Gates, looking suddenly up from a book he was reading at a table near them, and peeping over his spectacles. He slowly approached them, with his mild but searching eyes fixed on their downcast and blushing faces, while one hand rested impressively upon- the open page of the book he had been reading. He was an intelligent, wealthy bachelor, of some fifty or sixty years; " a caustic-a real, genu- ine old bachelor," Fanny Pons called him. Well, he was a caustic-a purely genuine article, as our newspaper say-healing as well as cura. tive. He need not be described to the general reader any further than this. He was so exactly the counterpart of Miss Sedgwick'9' Cousin Frank," in the last number of the "Democratic Review," and of the elderly gentleman, in particular, of Mrs. Seba Smith's chapter on old gentlemen in general, that when he first appeared abroad after the ap- pearance of those papers, on all sides it was-"Mr. Gates, why didn't    <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6890-00000032"/> "      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN you tell me you were acquainted with Mrs. Seba Smith? She told all about you in the last ' Ladies' Companion ;'" or, "Uncle Gates, I would like to know who told Mrs. Seba Smith how Caroline, and Jane, and Sara, and I, always make you our first and dernier resort in all emergencies. Are you in her correspondence?"This was in '38; and just a few davs since, when Mrs. Pons met him in the street-"Why, my good friend, when did you sit to Miss Sedgwick for your portrait? Every lady in Franklin is so anxious to know! As Professor Bancroft says, 't is a !rfectfarc simile. Fanny denies the resemblance. Some way, you have never been a favorite of hers, Mr. Gates. Oh! have you heard about lr s. Frank fIoward? 'Tis delightful-so pleasant!" But to return to the party at Mrs. Pons's. The girls were inexpressibly mortified and vexed, on ascertaining that Mr. Gates had been hearing their uncharitable strictures. "Who would have guessed it, when he appeared so totally absorbed in his book?-the hypocrite!" thought Fanny Pons. ' La! wqell, I guess nobody cares," thought Miss Gass;-yet that she c Ared, was obvious. Her eyes were still bent in shame upon the fan she "was demolishinF. and when she looked up at length, with a desperate attempt at smiling all in unconcern, "grinned horribly," &amp;c., thought Mr. Gates. After looking quietly at them a few moments, Mr. Gates commenced reading from the book he held-Miss Sedgwick's "Means and Ends :" "'The most prevailing fault of conversation in the country, and, I be- lieve, in all social communities, is gossiping. As weeds most infest the richest soil, so gossiping most abounds amid the social virtues in small towns, where there is the most extended mutual acquaintance, where per- sons live in the closest intimacy, resembling a large family circle. To disturb the sweet uses of the little community by gossiping, is surely to forfeit the benefit of one of the kindest arrangements of Providence. In great and busy cities, where people live in total ignorance of their neigh- bors, where they cannot know how they live, and hardly know when they die, there is no neighborhood, and no gossiping, But need there be this poisonous weed among the flowers-this blight upon the fruit, my young friends?'" The girls knew very well, that Mr. Gates always said and did just what he pleased, and that there was no use, at all, in being vexed about it. And, besides, the coolness, dignity-and withal, good nature of his manner, fairly precluded the possibility of the thing; and induced them to submit to his refined mode of castigation with the best grace they could assume. -Poor Jenlie heard not a word of the conversation beyond what related to herself. "Oh dear! how vexatious! She was sure there never did occur anything so intolerable; and wished Howard had stayed at the south, or west, or anywhere, rather than come to Franklin, to make her miserable." So far Jane had proceeded when interrupted by Miss Gra- ham's merry tones. She was approaching the window, where Jane sat.   1 H L LA.   . ..L IN ST!ATES.     '67 Professor Bancroft, do let me look in your pocket, for one Jennie Am- brose," said she; and Jane laughed in spite of her vexation. Miss Gra- ham flung back the curtain. "There! you child! You don't know that you are advertised, literally advertised. Come and see." She took Jane's arm, and led her to the door, between the sitting-room and the parlor; and surely she was advertised. On a small scrap of paper, in Miss Graham's chirography, was the following: "Strayed or stolen from the subscriber, Jennie Ambrose. 'Said Jennie was a young creature of eighteen summers-number of winters not certainly ascertained-tall as an Amazon, dignified as Juno, beautiful and happy as Venus, graceful as Hebe, animated as Terpsichore, and beloved by all, as the reflected figure of Narcissus, by himself. Whosoever will return said Jennie, to said Jennie's anxious, and afflicted, and agonizing friends, or give infor- mation respecting her, shall receive his or her weight in flowers, rubies, rainbows, satin, velvet, diamonds and gold." "Nonsense, Nora!" said Jane, as she finished reading. "Why, my dear, I did but rhapsodize myself into an imitation of certain poetasters, and novelists;" replied Miss Graham. "Nonsense!" and Jane looked as if she thought everything in the world nonsense, as she snatched down the paper. "Come, Nora, let's go home; I am tired to death, almost." "Mirabile dictu!-- tired to death, almost!' Why, Jennie, I don't know you;" said Miss Graham, holding her back at arm's-length, and surveying her whole figure. "You look, 'fore all the world, like one in despair." "And so I am. But there comes Caroline and Howard! Oh dear! Let us go, dear Nora;--no, they see us. Well, do talk as fast as you can, Nora. Do n't give him a chance to look at me, or to speak to me." "Why, what do. you mean, dear Jane? Your arm trembles." "Don't ask me now. I will tell you all some time;--only do as I wish."  Miss Graham was excessively puzzled; but she managed none the less adroitly. To the great relief of Jane, who felt the smallness of their party a restraint, they were soon joined by others, and she again found a chance of escape. But not, as before, was her flight successful. She had gained the hall with the purpose of going to Fanny's study, where she meant to remain the rest of the evening, with a few quiet elderly people, who had occupied the room since their arrival. She heard a quick step behind her, and: looking round, she saw Mr. Howard. With his usual tenderness of manner, and the delight he always manifested on finding himself by her side, after the shortest absence, he took her hand and drew it through his arm. Everything Jane had heard and seen that evening, memories of all she had enjoyed in his society, and a dread of all she must suffer in its loss, passed through her mind in a moment, and she felt like one stupefied. She trembled so, that she could scarcely stand, even,with the support Howard's arm afforded; and leaning against I    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6890-00000033"/> 68      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN the wall, she burst into tears. Howard appeared much shocked. He clasped her hand closer in his, encircled her waist to support her, and begged an explanation. - This Jane was immediately determined on not giving; and as all tenderness gave way to indignation against such duplicities as Howard's, she broke impatiently from his arms, dashed off her tears, and with a proud step entered the study. He followed her in a sort of dreamy wonder; but Jane purposely *sut out all chance of communication, by taking a seat between two grave matrons, who were delighted by this new accession to their number. Mr. Luton, of the lower village, drew Howard into a conversation about abolition; and, meanwhile, Jane had leisure to sustain her part in a discussion of the utility and pleasure of large parties, and to reflect that by such open ex- pressions of displeasure, she would put upon herself the necessity of coming to an explanation. This was a species of humility she could in no wise impose upon herself; so she resolved to treat Howard just so courteously that he could find no grounds of complaint. Mrs. Luton expressed a conviction from which Jane dissented. Mrs. Luton was not quite sure she was right; she would ask her husband. She appealed to him, accordingly; and he, in his turn, to Howard. In this way Howard was drawn into the controversy, and to the side of Jane. At length it was decided that, although man was not set down in a large party at creation, it might sometimes be proper, and right, and pleasant, for one to meet all one's friends under one roof. "Miss Ambrose," said Howard, hesitatingly--he had lately called hei Jennie-"Miss Ambrose, I fear Miss Graham will be compelled to ad- vertise you again. Shall I accompany you to her?" Jane took his arm, and began talking with all earnestness and rapidity of just the things that were farthest from her heart. But it would not do. Howard detained her on the way, and again demanded an explanation. Jane attempted to laugh, and to run away from him; but he was decidedly serious; and he again begged her, as she valued his peace, to tell him if he had been so unfortunate as to offend her. Jane an- swered evasively. "Why, Mr. Howard, you know I always act just as I feel. And you know there is no mortal-at least, no mortal lady-who does not some- times feel like crying and pouting. I heard something from two ladies that vexed and mortified me; and I was running off to cry or pout it out alone, when you interrupted me. But you see I was not to be cheated out of my relief, even by your presence; so I pouted and cried. Now I feel better. Yet I shall doubtless be disturbed in some way a hundred times; and a hundred times adopt the same ready and efficacious ,anacea; and you must not, in one other instance, plague me by demand- ing explanations, when none are to be given. Do you promise compli- ance? Ah, I shall not give you up for that sober shake of your head; say, do you promise?"   THE EASTERN STATES.            69 "t Yes, Miss Ambrose, yes;-if you do not wish my interference. Yet you do not know how unwillingly I gave up that sweet, sisterly con- fidence, which has been so dear to me." His voice trembled; and, for a moment, Jane felt as if she had been inflicting, instead of receiving, an injury. "Sisterly confidence!" thought she. Yes, he is to be my brother; the husband of my own dear Caro- line; and I will forgive him. But how amazing! So fond of him, for- sooth! These unpleasant cogitations occupied her until they reached the parlor. Howard led her in silence to Caroline. He remained near her the rest of the evening-accompanied her and Caroline home-but every appearance of his accustomed vivacity had fled. Jane attempted to com- mand her usual cheerfulness, but her tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of her mouth. She felt as if her heart were bursting; and never was re- lief greater than hers, when she locked her chamber door and gave her- self up to bitter tears. CHAPTER XII. SHE passed a restless and miserable night. Several times she fell into an uneasy slumber, from which she was aroused by horrible dreams of precipices in the way she must tread; of serpents springing up in her pathway, and coiling about her; and of frightful people, with eyes and mouths sufficiently capacious and awful to destroy her. The morning found her nervous and unrefreshed; her head ached violently; and she determined on making this an apology for remaining in her room through the day. Not until evening did she venture below stairs. On entering the sitting-room, she found Howard and Frederic alone. The evening w, as delightful; and Jane proposed a walk in the yard to Frederic. He invited Howard to accompany them. He half rose as if in compliance  then sat down and looked in Jane's face, as if for her permission. This she granted with a smile; and they were leaving the house, when Fred- eric suddenly recollected that he was to meet the rest of a committee of arrangements fo/a forth-coming boat-ride. Jane dreaded being left alone with Howard, and drew back half-involuntarily when he offered his arm. But recollecting what she owed him in the character of a guest ;-herself, if she would effect the concealment she desired ;-and affected by the expression of painful feeling which settled on Howard's features, she took his arm and they proceededupon their walk. Instead of throwing off her depression, as she wished, she found it every moment increasing by the silence and dejection of Howard. She felt that, whatever might be the cause, he was at least half as miserable as herself. His step had lost all its elasticity, and was heavy and mechanical. His eyes were bent upon the ground-his arms folded upon his breast-and such was the melan- 5        ,   {i    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6890-00000034"/> 70      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN choly dejection of his whole air, that Jane could have wept for him as easily as for herself. '"You find me a dull companion this evening, Mr. Howard," said she; bilt my headache has made me so nervous and low-spirited, I don't know whhat to do or say. I long to creep into some sly niche, and, statue-like, s:ay in just that spot for ever." Mr. Howard did not reply for some moments; and when he did, it was ill the slow, sad tones one's youthful fancy associates with Watts's lyric: '- Hark! from the tombs a doleful sound," &amp;c. Again they walked on in silence. They stood a few minutes by the conservatory, as if it had been the grave of a dear friend; and then Jane proposed returning to the hlouse, on the plea of avoiding the heavy dews. To her great relief-for she tfelt ready to sink beneath her reflections-she saw her little dog running to meet her. He sprang to her head, wagged his tail, licked her hands and face, and exhibited sundry other canine tokens of joy and fondness. "Ah, my good Fido!" said Jane, stooping to pat his head. "He is a fond creature, Miss Ambrose," said Howard, evidently as much relieved as Jane by this interruption. "Yes; he is my best friend-next to papa, and mamma, and--" There! Jane had grown misanthropic in one short day. She really f:-lt that "all mankind are a worthless pack ;" and that she had not a friend in the world, except her father, her mother, and her little dog. The family had gathered in the sitting-room; and Jane saw pleasant faces and heard pleasant tones, as she passed along the colonnade before tihe windows. The sitting-room door was open; and, waving her hand for Howard to enter, she passed on,vand went up-stairs to her own room. hlle knew it was their time for pleasant chat and singing; but she felt as i ' she could no more command herself to sing, or even to enter that room, than she could stem that torrent of agitated feeling, or trace it to its source. She found herself without one means of relief. Having never needed them, she had failed to secure for herself ballast and rudder. Silken sail and gilded oar were enough for such sails as hers had hitherto been, upon the sea of pleasure; but she found them wholly useless in the present storm. "Where is Jennie?" said the colonel, pausing in the midst of an ani- mated discussion with Caroline and Miss Graham, about dictates of con- science; and, in connection, about Paley, Parkhurst, and " good old Saint Paul." "I do n't know; I supposed she had just gone to her room for a mo- ment," answered Mrs. Ambrose.. They looked to Howard, as if for an explanation; but he turned away to make some far-fetched remark to Henry. Miss Graham ran to the (bot of the stairs, and sang: Dearest, for thee, thee only, These mountain wilds are sweet to me; Each crag and mountain lonely, le blat because 't is loved by tlhe."   THE EASTERN STATES.            71 "The Mountain Bugle ' was then new to tnem, and a great favorite. Every evening, for more than a week, they had sung it in their circle; and often it had thrilled Jane so rapturously, that she could scarcely breathe. Now it fell on her ear like a dirge. Presently, as she had anticipated, she heard light footsteps on the stairs; and she had only time to throw her hair all about her face, and place herself before the mirror, before Miss Graham entered. "Ha, truant! So, I have caught you at your devotions, at what a saucy gentleman in Boston calls woman's shrine." Jane forced a laugh, so loud, indeed, that it reached the ears of the sitting-room occupants-Howard inclusive-but as unnatural and hollow as can be conceived. "Well, come, Jennie; we are waiting for you to sing with us," said Miss Graham; and as she tumbled over the contents of Jane's toilet- drawer, she sang: "From the home by thee made dear;" Then starting up-"Come, Jennie dear; put your hair back just so- there; for in that careless mode it always looks best, or makes you look best, which is the same thing, as Mr. Baldwin proved to-day in a pro. found dissertation of three hours' length. He inquired very mournfully, Jennie, whether your affection of the head-for so he dubbed your head- ache-were at all vertiginous, and left his regret ful com-pli-ments for you; and-Oh, Jennie! here is the new moon. Let's look at it, and say three times: "New moon! new moon! hail unto thee! When to sleep I bow my head, Let the man I am to wed, Smile on me.' And then we shall know whether you aye to marry Baldwin, and I How- ard, as present appearances indicate." Jane's laugh became even more gay, as she forced herself to join in Miss Graham's merriment. Her hair arranged to her satisfaction, she attended Miss Graham to the sitting-room; and when there, dreading the vacuum in the conversation, which might give her time for thought, or Howard time to attend to her, she kept herself and all the rest in a state of tumultuous merriment. Several times, during the evening, Howard found himself admiring her singular grace and vivacity, the brilliancy of her humor, and the jingling melody of her childish laugh ;--it was but for a moment.  Recollections of her inconsistencies broke the laugh upon his lips, and clouded his brow. As the hour for devotional exercises drew near, Jane went back to the sofa, and seated herself where she could neither see Howard, or be seen by him. On becoming quiet, she felt all the fatigue she had incurred by the extraordinary exertions she had been making. It seemed to her, that she could not endure the re-    <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6890-00000035"/> 72      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN straints imposed by society, another half hour, so completely exhausted was she; and great was her relief when Alice and James appeared with their bibles. Mr. Ambrose read a touching and beautiful portion of the Psalms, and then prayed. Meanwhile Jane leaned upon the arm of the sofa, buried her face in her handkerchief, and, in a flood of tears, gave vent to emotions that seemed suffocating her. Her passion was silent. Ioward only saw it in the convulsions of her form. He heard scarcely a word of the prayer; and immediately upon its conclusion, he retired to his room, to think about that strange Jennie-her capriciousness, her beauty, her smiles and her tears. His sleeping dreams took the hue of his waking ones, and were but new editions of hours, pleasant and sad, he lhad spent with Jane since his arrival at Franklin. "And this is what is meant by heaviness of heart," thought Jane, on the following morning, as she threw open her window and sat down by it. She had one feeling only: that was of excessive weariness and de- pression; one wish: that was, that it was for her to sit there always, without a single effort, mental or physical. Howard passed her window on his return from an early walk. He saw her; and half-forgetful of what had recently happened, he was on the point of kissing his hand to her; but Jane's pale and melancholy face did not allow him to forget himself so far. He bowed slightly, with a sickly attempt to smile; and then, quickening his step, was soon out of sight. Jane kept her eye fixed a long time on the spot where his form disappeared. "This will never do," said she, starting up as if in the attempt to arouse herself-" this won't do; my spirits will fall below a possibility of raising them; and he will again demand an explanation; and this I shall never, never give-no! So, Frank, all the delights of our intercourse are at an end. Would to Heaven our intercourse itself might end as suddenly. But he shall be deceived. 1I will convince him and others that I am not the fond, pert, forward being he supposed. That does not sound like Howard; and yet, he said it. 'Much too fond of him for his perfect enjoyment.' Nonsense, Howard! you shall see that I can leave you to your perfect enjoyment. Yes, he shall be deceived. Deception! I abhor it! And yet, Frank, you have forced me to it." She stood leaning on her desk until the breakfast-bell rang. She started, caught up her flageolet, and played a light air. As she hoped, llis gave her nerves a healthy spring; and when Miss Graham called for her on her way to the dining-room, she met her with much of her usual animation. All the rest of the family had assembled when they entered. She nodded gayly to them, en masse; and, instead of taking her accustomed seat opposite Howard, she shook her finger, with an air of playful triumph, at Caroline, and threw herself into her seat beside Miss Graham. Caroline had nothing left for her, but to take the seat Jane had vacated. "Jane, how capricious! What is this for!" inquired she, while seat- ing herself.   THE EAS'I'ERN STATES.           73 a' Why, firstly, as old Father Lawrence says-firstly, because I wish- ed to please you and Mr. Howard. Secondly, because I wish to tell Nora my dream, that she may give me the interpretation thereof." "Ha! I had forgotten, as I live," exclaimed Miss Graham, dropping her knife and fork. "What did I dream? Gone! I had just caught ai glimpse of something pleasant as it flitted from my cranium. You must know, friends," added she, looking round upon the group--" you must know that Jennie and I said 'New moon, new moon,' et cetera, at the moon last evening; and then you know, colonel, and you know, Mrs. Ambrose, and you, Caroline, Hal, Howard, Fred, and all, that one will certainly marry the person one dreans about. 'T is too bad! I meant to dream about the ugliest chap in creation, just to make it the more amusing. Jennie, who are you going to marry?" "Mr. Baldwin, it seems, for he 'smiled on me."' Ellenora and Jane seemed under the same impulse. They both half rose, clasped their hands, and then sat down to laugh. "Well," said Frederic with comical seriousness, "you can doubtless calculate correctly from such premises, at what time you will demand bridal favors." For the first time during breakfast, Jane's eyes met Howard's, when she raised them to answer her brother. His were bent steadily on her, with a mingled expression of sadness and reproach; but he withdrew them immediately on their meeting hers. Jane felt the blood rush to her face and neck. Her pulsations became so violent and rapid, as almost to deafen her; and the lively reply died on her lips. But her agitation was unnoticed, for Miss Graham answered for her. "Oh! she will be in no haste to consummate her unhappiness. You know Baldwin is in rather bad favor in her quarter." "Nay, my dear," answered Jane: "hast forgotten how we ruralized in our walk by the river? how we botanized in the garden? moralized over Shakspere? sentimentalized over Byron? and-and tantalized over -and tantalized everywhere?" "Ha, ha! yes, Jennie, you did tantalize everywhere. Nay, there is no use in protestations; for I remember your opinion of him :-' One would as lief sit down in a ruined monastery, to read "Young's Night Thoughts" by moonlight, with no companions but bats and owls, as to find one's self fastened to him in a tete-a-tete.' Dost remember this, Jennie?" "Yes, and the old adage, likewise:-' One extreme follows another!' Ah, nous verrons, Nora." Then turning to her mother, "Mamma, I want your leave to spend the day with the Holts. Alice saw little Charley last evening, and he said his mother is very fele, and very anxious to see me. Our visitors will excuse me." She turned to Miss Graham, but could not bring herself to meet How. ard's glance again.    <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6890-00000036"/> 74      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFEIN "I shall reckon it a deliverance, sha' n't you, Howard?" said Miss ( raham. To Jane's great relief, her mother rose from the table: all followed, and Jane ran immediately from the room; not, however, until she heard Miss Graham say: Ah! stop, Mr. Howard. Sha' n't we feel it a deliverance?" ' Yes; no-or I do not know," answered Howard. There was some- thin, in his tones and his hesitation, that brought tears to Jane's eyes, and lo,ngings for reconciliation to her heart. But then came recollections of all she had heard, and with them a sort of exultation, in the thought that she was giving -him pain by her coldness. Ah, Jane! miserable com- forters were yours! and miserably did they sustain you! CHAPTER XIII. To Maria Iayes, the party at Mrs. Pons's was a scene of unmixed de- light. She felt as if transferred at once to enchanted ground; for like enchantment had seemed the scenes in the "Children of the Abbey," since informed by her mother that they had no realities in life; and ,very character in that book had left its image in her heart, for which she found a counterpart at Mrs. Pons's. Mr. Flanders had every virtue and every grace of Mortimer;-and if she might have trusted the mourn. fil, but evidently sincere, praises of her mother, the flatteries her cousin looked, as in mute surprise and pleasure he gazed on her, after the com- Iletion of her toilet; the encomiums she heard on all sides, on entering the rooms and afterward, and the attentions she received, she would have fancied herself in possession of the sweetness and amiability of Amanda. In Jane and Miss Graham, she found the ease and gayety of "the light- hearted Macqueens ;" in Caroline, the dignity and mildness of the lady Araminta. Mr. Howard's was the quiet playfulness and lordly bearing of Bingley, at first; but she went to sleep, wondering which was most like Mortimner, Howart or Flanders. She rose next morning with a light and happy heart. On the evening of the eighth, she and her cousin were to sail with the Ambroses, their guests, and others on the river. On the linlt, they were engaged to accompany Professor Bancroft, his pupils, and a large party of the villagers, to the lake; and in a few days, she was to accompany Jane alone in a ramble through the "Indian Carry- ing Way ;" there to search for arrows, remains of pottery, and other rel. ics foind thele, round the "Ox Bow,"-a curve of Hogarthian beauty and grace, in the Winnipiseogee river, near its confluence with the Pen. ligcwansset; thence, to follow a romantic well-trodden path, through   THE EASTERN STATES.            75 groves, fields, and pastures, up rt, old farmer Taylor's on the interval. There they would be regaled with honey, maple-sugar, jellies, home. brewed, &amp;c. by Mrs. Taylor, and be shown fat hogs, half as large as elephants, curious hens with a sort of imperial crowns, which the Tay- lors called " top-knots," peacocks, an India parrot, which did just nothing at all but mock people, an English rabbit, and a tamed crow, robin and woodpecker, by Mr. Taylor himself. This good, warm-hearted couple, nad no children, and on these, their pets, they lavished all their fondness and pride; and they were never so happy as when presenting them to the admiration of visitors. So Jane had told Maria; and she was think- ing of all this when she entered the parlor where her cousin sat, engaged in reading. He took her hand in his, and kissed her cheek. "Well, my cousin, I need not ask how you find yourself this morn- ing?" said he. "I see you have not suffered by one night's dissipation." "Suffered! No, indeed, cousin. But all was so strange and beautiful, I feel as if it must be a drea-m." Mrs. Hayes entered. "Good morning, dear mother," said Maria. "You and cousin were right: the study 6f human nature is indeed pleasant." "Then you did like the party, Maria?" "Oh! yes." "But, Maria, you mustn't expect to find every page as pleasant as this; must she, aunt?" "No, no; I guess she must n't. You'll find dark, dark pages yet; and perhaps you 'll wish some day, that you had n't begun the study." "Perhaps so, mother; but I will hope otherwise." "Yes, yes; 't is easy to hope at your age; and I pray that the time may never come, when you will have no hope in time to come-no pleas- ure in the past or present; for 't is an awful situation to be in, Mari." The poor woman shuddered as she concluded. "Yes, mother, it must be," saidMaria, attempting to speak cheerfully; "and we have reason to be grateful that it is not ours. Mother, I long to have you see those Ambroses. You will love Mrs. Ambrose, she is so good, and sensible, and humble, too. I thought I should feel desolate, indeed, cousin, especially if parted from you a moment. But those dear, kind Ambrose girls, and Miss Graham--thoughtless as she appears- seemed to enter right into my feelings; and, without being troublesome, too, as Mrs. Pons's kindness sometimes made her, they paid me just the attentions I needed, to make me forget that I was a stranger, and ignorant of almost all necessary things."  "And Mr. Henry Ambrose, how did you like him, cousin?" asked Mr. Flanders. "Why, I admire him; he is a noble fellow. I heard Mrs. Pons telling the Misses Clement, of Boscaven, that he is engaged to Miss Graham. This seems quite probable; for he hovered about her all the evening, or, at least, attempted to; but she is so much like a will-o'.th'-wisp, there was G   #    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6890-00000037"/> 76      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN no such thing as keeping near her. Is n't that Baldwin an odd specimen, cousin "  "Quite, I think, from the little I saw of him. He came into our circle when you were engaged in conversation with Mrs. Ambrose and Howard. He had been making a solitary circuit round the rooms, pour passer le temps, he said; and he straightway began to lecture on physics and meta. physics-on extraordinary developments, by means of which metaphysics are no longer meta phusis--on the primum mobile of physical and meta. physical action; and sundry other things of like character. All this he appeared to do, to demonstrate to us his erudition, which was contempt. ibly shallow, as would have been seen in his miserable attempts at dis. play, even if his blundering use and articulation of the Latin and French he quoted, and the general mistiness of his ideas, had not shown it. A scholar wears his knowledge as naturally as he wears his hat, and is no more proud of one than the other. Such is Mr. Howard;'and such Mr. Henry Ambrose." "Yes; so it seems to me. But how did you manage to shake him off so soon? He looked, when joining your party, as if fastening himself for the evening." "Miss Jane Ambrose, in the very spirit of mischief, dispatched him in search of her fan. She only knew that she left it in the dining-room, parlor, dressing room, or study." "IIa! that was like her.' Mother, she has promised to call here often; and you will love her. Cousin, if you do fall in love with her, as it seems to me you must, I suppose you will have a plenty of cousin's room in your heart for me; else, I shal be half-jealous in spite of myself." "I sha'n't assure you of this, Maria," answered Mr. Flanders, laughing. (" owe you some little torment for your inflictions upon me last evening. You must know, aunt, that Maria was so captivated by the fine personal appearance, talent, and polite attentions of Mr. Howard, that she had neither eyes, nor ears, nor even 'cousin's room,' in her heart for me." Maria laughed and blushed. "Well, cousin, do you know they all said we are enough alike to be brother and sister? and Mr. Howard and Mrs. Ambrose, were both very much startled by my extraordinary re. semblance to Mrs. Howard." Maria said no more; for her attention was drawn to her mother, by her heavy breathing, lustreless eye, and pale cheek. She soon rose, and with difficulty made her way to her room. Maria followed her, and at- tempted to assist her; but with something of her old asperity, she shook her off, and ordered her to return to the breakfast-room. Maria burst into tears as soon as she reached the room she had left. "Oh! my poor mother! Cousin, she must die of this terrible disease; and Hhow wretched I shall be! Why must ft ever be so I I can't lecollect a time when I was very happy, that something did not come to   -THE EASTERN STATES..

Flanders leaned over hf chair, and tenderly laid his -hand on her head. . "The, yery hairs of your head are all numbered, my sweet cousin. There is one who will never leave- you, nor forsake you; and He is of more value than allearthly comforts. Think of this, my Maria, in all times of trial; and, trust me, you are to see many days of happiness yet."  "Ah! so I have always hoped, in -spite of every reason to fear the contrary; and this has. been a sort of vague comfort to me, ever since I have remembered. Yet, 't was all visionary; and I begin ,to feel that it is." -        . .. . She passed a wretched forenoon; but when her mother rejoined them at dinner, she had regained'-her usual calmness; and Maria, always ready to hope, fund herself.. again looking forward to days and years of happiness, and even congratulating herself on the pleasantness of her own situation .  Weeks passed on. For Maria, the instructions of her cousin, the in. timacy of the Ambroses, and their visitors, together with tie society ot the first and best in the village, had finished the beautiful handiwork of nature. But she still had her one sorrow.; andiit was the increasing de- bility and melancholy of her mother. Yet ,she had wept in the fullness of her happiness, while sailing down the Merrimac,--when dark shadows were on the banks, and dark reflections on the waters; when no sound was heard save the low, rich tones of the village band in a contiguous boat; and when a day of excessive sultriness, rendered the cool, clear air of evening doubly delicious and exhilarating. And she had grown faint, and almost breathless with the 'emotions of rapture and awe, that thrilled her whole frame, as from the top of an island, that shoots up like a pyramid in the Winnipiseogee, she took in a view ofthe whole scene- Governor's Island, with its broad, waving fields of grain and grass ; its stately and hospitable mansion, and its cottages ;-the blue waters of the lake that spread out far and,wide before them, studded with countless islands of verdant and picturesque beauty, in the determination of whose outlines and relative positions, nature indeed designed with a perfect mind, and worked with a perfect hand.  All this, and much more, Maria had felt and enjoyed. Jane iad,shared all her diversions, yet maugre these, aid irnumerable other happy in. cidentals, she had grown languid and-pale. -Mrs. Ambrose and Caroline felt many tender anxieties about, this -chabge$ but finding their efforts to ascertain its cause, alike unavailing to themselves, and annoying to Jane, they relinquished all,'but their efforts to win her back to her usualcheer. fulness, by, increasing. tendetness! toward her.: ;As Jane Ppromised Miss Graham at Mrs. Pons's,'she told herthe' cause of, her emotion; and now she was ready to release her from all embarrassing situations, with a    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6890-00000038"/> 78      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN tact which seemed all in carelessness, but which originated really in her love for Jane, and her earnest desires fqr her peace. When Jane was joked by a neighbor upon Mr. Howard's attentions to her, and her pros. pects of an early removal to Virginia, as sometimes happened in Howard's presence, Miss Graham always turned the tide against herself, by de. claring, that it was she with whom Howard was going to elope. When Jane was in danger of being left alone with Howard-..an event which she dreaded above all things; and which he seemed, at first, most to desire-Miss Graham always started out from some niche near, to Jane's unspeakable relief. Howard, at length, abandoned all efforts for an in. terview. He was still devoted to Caroline; and Maria seemed to fill the place in his heart formerly occupied by Jane. At last, the time allotted for Miss Graham's stay expired; and she re. turned home, leaving Jane utterly disconsolate: and yet she sometimes congratulated herself on her loss; for now she had a sufficient plea for sadness and all its manifestations, such as swollen eyes, absence of mind, defective appetite, &amp;c. It was conjectured by all Franklin, that Miss Graham would soon'return to them as the bride of Henry-now that his studies were completed, and now that he was about to be associated in his office with the superannuated, but still skillful Dr. Hammond. These conjectures became absolute certainty, when, on hinting them to Henry, he only smiled and said nothing. "Well," said the good Mr. Herbert, 4 if you do get that girl, you'll . get a prize. Nothing gloomy can live where she is; and you will be as happy as a king all your life." "You 'll get a critter that you 'll have to see to, that 's a fact," said old Mr. Holt; "or else she'll turn your house upside down, and you topsy. turvy, especially when your Jane gets along with her." That Henry fully believed this, is not likely; for he only laughed. After Miss Graham's departure, Jane spent more time in her room, devoted more to the young widow Holt, whose fast-failing appetite and strength warned her of a premature grave; and she spent a week at one time with the Taylors. Mrs. Taylor was ill; she felt for Jane all the fondness of a mother; and Jane willingly conceded to her wishes in re. maining with her until she was convalescent. On her return home, she was shocked at the alteration in Howard's look and manner. She had scarcely looked at him for weeks before leaving home; but now that her eyes were fixed on his pale, thoughtful face, she did not withdraw them until they met his. She blushed deeply, and then became deadly pale. She rose to leave the room; but trembled so that she could not stand, and sank again on the sofa. Howard approached her, extending his hand to her as he said, "Miss AmbroeJennie-will you---  " when he was interrupted by Caroline's entrance, turned, and left the room. Jane bent her head over an open book she held in her hand, until Caroline found the paper for which she was looking,-iand left the room. She hoped Howard would return; for, much as she felt he had wronged her, his   THE EASTERN STATES.            79 evident unhappiness made her pity him, and long to be restored again to his friendship. She trembled asshe heard him descending the stairs; but instead of entering, he left the house and walked toward Mrs. Hayes's. On his return, which was in a few moments, Jane had been joined by others of the family. He brought intelligence that astonished and grieved 'them all: Mrs. Hayes and her daughter took the noithernstage that morn. ing, without giving any one an intimation 6f their purpose'or route. Flan.. ders had left Franklin a few days previously, for the purpose of spending a few days in Boston. He returned at the appointed time, and found a note in the post-office, where it had been left by little Henry Pons at Maria's request. It was written in haste and evident agitation, and ran as follows: "MY DEAR, DEAR CoSIN :--I have had only time to dress as hastily as possible, since my poor mother told me that we areto take the stage this morning for-I know not where; and she refuses to tell me, yet more in dread and grief, it seems, than in unkindness. She has been making preparations ever since you left. I have assisted her in her plans, little thinking they were to take me far, far from you and happiness. But she is my mother-a poor, sick, unhappy woman; and I shall go wherever she sees fit to take me ;-and, oh! cousin, I feel now that it will be to an early grave. But it will not trouble me-: I even long to be there, now that all hope is gone. This was all that made life tolerable until I found you. Now-   but' no more. I have left a little parcel of presents for those I love best, in a paper among the flowers on the .north side of the little arbor.. The bosom-pin and the pencil-cuse; mother says, were given to me when I was a child, together With the ring I wear,-!I shall not part with that. Accept the pin, dear cousin; 'tisaa poor expression of the esteem and gratitude I feel for you. Mr. Howard has been as a brother to me: give him the pencil-case-he has oftenadmired its curious style of construction. Those locks of hair, cut just now from my head, give to those dear, dear Ambrose girls. Tell them I shall love them'and pray for them while I live. Oh, my God! shall I never meet any of you again? You would tell me, my cousin, that we shall meet in heaven: this is indeed a comfort to me now.' "I shall inform you of our location if mother does not forbid it, as I fear she will.  "The stage is at the hotel; and here is the good little HeiryePons, come to make his usual morning call. I shall leave this note with him. Oh! how hiy head whirls! I can scarcely'see. God bless you, dear cousin!    '         'Your own.     MARIA." Mr. Flanders took the note and the gifts together to Mr. Ambrose's. His whole frame shook so that he could scarcely open the note or read it; and many were the tears Mrs. Ambrose and her daughters shed for their unfortunate friend.    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6890-00000039"/> 80      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN Flanders had now no nome at Franklin. He spent a few days with the Ambroses, in hopes of finding someclue to this mysterious movement on the part of his aunt; but finding none, with a heavy heart he returned to his home. "' Woes cluster upon us, dear sister," said Caroline, as, on the evening after his departure, she entered Jane's room. "Howard has just received a letter from home, urging his immediate return, on account of the sudden and alarming illness of his mother. He is completely overcome." Jane flung her arms round Caroline's neck, and the sisters wept in each other's arms. Poor Jane felt that her days of happiness were over; that trial was to follow close upon trial, as long as she could bear up under them. When they went below-stairs, Howard was in his room, busied with Henry in preparations for an early departure on the morrow; and did not join the family until' the hour for prayer. A funeral sadness and silence pervaded the whole group. They all knelt with Mr. Ambrose, and when he prayed for Mrs. Howard, they longed to prostrate themselves to the very dust in supplications for her life. He prayed for Howard and for his family-that they might meet again, and renew their delightful intercourse on earth, if it might be; if not, that they might all meet in that world where death and partings are no more. His voice was scarcely audible; and sobs from every bosom present mingled with his prayers. They rose onthe next morning to an early breakfast. It was scarcely tasted; and just as they rose from the table, the stage coach wheeled rapidly up the avenue and round the carriage-sweep. (' Good-bye, and God bless you!" said the colonel, as he wrung How. ard's hand. "Return to us if possible. Come here as you would go to a father's house: a son could not be more welcome." "Yes;' tell your mother that you leave those in Franklin--"Mrs. Ambrose began; but the idea that she might be framing a message to one who was in eternity, awed and overpowered her; and she pressed How- ard's hand in silence. Howard exchanged adieus with Caroline, Henry, and Frederic, and then turned to Jane. She had thrown herself in a chair; she was lean- ing her forehead on a table, and sobbing like a child. The calmness she acquired before leaving her room, and which she sustained with no small effort during breakfast, fled her entirely when adieus were being given. Howard bent over her. "Dear Jane!" said he. But she only sobbed the more, without look. ing up. "All ready " cried the driver. Mr. Howard clasped Jane's hand in both his, pressed it to his lips, and then rushed from the house. *    lTHEJ EkASTERN STATES.          81 CHAPRTER XIV. "POOR Maria! I shall die if you mourn so; it brings on that terrible eling in my head. But when you go to fixing up the house, and sweep- g off the sticks and straws from the green, and putting thingsin nice -der, then I think we are contented, and that all is right again.", So said Mrs. Hayes to Maria, as she entered the room where she was tting, with her face buried in her hands, sobbing as if her heart were reaking. "Poor child! you shall have money; you may buy books, flower- eds, and anything you want. Next year, you shall have a garden a ousand times, prettier than any at Franklin. Yoa shall---. but, Mari, hat is that music?" She approached the window where Maria sat, and w a beautiful young Indian girl approaching, singing in the wildest, earest tones, "Home, sweet home." Maria had heard it but once fore, when sailing on the far off Merrimac. And need the reader be d what it was that opened the flood-gates of emotion, which, with mag- mnimous reference to her mother's comfort, Maria had, until now, kept iperviously closed? No; it will be known that "sound of days that ere no more," were borne upon that lay-that memories of the' beauti- I Merrimac; loved, pleasant, and congenial associates;$ the witcheries the hour and the music-that these, with all their thrilling associations, ,re troubling the waters of her inmost soul. But prayers, too, for resig- tion and peace-For strength and grace to fulfil the hard task assigned r in life, mingled with her tears. And those who have ti ied the worth prayer in hours of suffering, will not wonder that there came a calm. ss and sweet dignity over her manner, which, united to her singular auty and gracefulness, made her seem, in the eyes of her idolizing rent, a being of almost supernatural loveliness. "Ah, poor Mar!" said she, with her eyes riveted on her face; " no )nder that you weary for bette? things-you were made fr them. But hould die if you did leave me alone." ' Leave you alone ' No, dear mother. I was cruel t b disturb you but I could not avoid it. 'T is almost night; let us aall that poor 'i in to stay ;-'t is a great way to a house." And it was a great way- to a hosise; for to a desolate spot in the north rt of Vermont, fifty miles from their old residence, Mrs. Hayes had ten Maria. She refused to inform her zany further than that the little nfort she had left, and perhaps her life, depended upon their remaining rest of her days in that spot; and that, without any communication :h their Franklin friends. Her- manner, as she made this dreadful nmunication, convinced Maria ofits truth; - and twhat sadrfices soever  night cost her,she promised to make no effoit to frustraie her mother's ns. But how utterly she regretted that she had beeii carried from her    <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6890-00000040"/> 82      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN seclusion, just to taste the thousand sweets of social intercourse, of know. ledge, of love for the lovely, and then to be'so cruelly snatched away from them for ever! The next moment she reproached herself for her ingratitude. Surely it was something that she had known that dear cou. sin; that she had been led by him to a better knowledge of creation and the Creator. Now she looked up to the stars, and he had taught her to call them by their names; she looked at the flowers, and at everything in nature, organic and inorganic, and he had initiated her into their mys. teries. Ten thousand beauties, and ten thousand sublimities, once unper. ceived even by her, now started out in the light of science, and filled her heart with love, and admiration, and awe. Her cousin had taught her a higher, holier trust in God, by correcting her narrow views of his pur. poses, character, and providences; and she now looked up to him as a tender father, who, whatever he would do by her, would do all things well. No wonder, then, that her cousin's idea was associated with all her enjoyments-all her thoughts. No wonder that he came at last, "All sainted, and inshrined to be The idol of hermemory." And no wonder the thought that she had parted with him for ever; and that, too, under circumstances calculated to throw a stain of suspicion over her, did, at times, rush upon her with heart-sickening power. But she brought an uncommon degree of inherent strength and perseverance -both moral and intellectual-to her work of contentment, together with an humble sense of all she owed her heavenly Parent, and of hope and trust in his protective power. These sustained her under all her regrets for the past, and her hopelessness of the future. These enabled her, through the long, dreary winter months, to bear even cheerfully up, under her own privations and toils, and her mother's increasing illness and despondency. Welcome to the girl were the earliest tokens of spring. And when the time came that she could visit the new, wild scenes of her neighborhood; when the song of birds and hum of insects were again in her ear, and the little wild flower looked up to her as she passed; she felt that there was not another blessing for which she ought to pine. CHAPTER XV. MBANWHLE, but'few events worthy of record had occurred at Frank. lin. Mrs. Holt had gone home; and to the last, Jane watched her comr. fort with a sister's care. In her ministries to her, in witnessing her trials and her resignation under them, Jane found holy and healing in- fluences for her own spirit. She became a more thoughtful and a better   THE EASTERN. STATES.           83 being-more lowly in her own 'eyes, and more lovely in the estimation of all around her. Henry was fairly established in the practice of his profession, with Doctor Hammond. Every week, there came to himn a neatly folded, perfumed, gilt edged sheet, all covered with the prettiest little characters that ever pretty fairy or pretty lady traced. None but Henry knew their import; yet, that they were of intense and most pleasing interest to him, none doubted who saw his emotion, as he read, or-the serious, but happy thoughtfulness they always induced. Sidney had returned to Franklin. He had been absent since the com. mencement of our story, on a western tour, for the purpose of purchasing lands for his future occupancy, if, upon comparison, he gave that place the preference to his own New England. He weighed them well-the advantages and disadvantages in points of wealth, social privileges, moral and intellectual condition, &amp;c.; and the results were, a conversion to one of Dudley Leavitt's homely, but significant truisms:- "If a family would but voluntarily live as meanly here, as they would be forced to do there, they would gradually become rich;" and a determination to pur. chase a small, but valuable farm, in his native town; and to make vol. untarily some of the sacrifices-these he would. be compelled to make by going west-by way of enlarging his farm somewhat, filling his library,  and procuring for himself time for social intercourse, and literary and scientific pursuits. Of this, he informed the happy Caroline, as soon as he could draw her from the family and the neighbors, who followed him to Mr. Ambrose's, whither he repaired almost immediately upon his arrival. "And now he has decided on not going west, all my dread of an event that uust soon take place, is at an end; and I shall no longer avoid speaking freely about it to you, dear Jane," said Caroline afterward. She blushed as she spoke; Jane became pale and faint. "What event, dear sister?' Caroline again blushed and laughed.  "I thought your ready conjectures would save me all awkward ex. planations. I mean my marriage." "With Howard, surely," gasped Jane.  "With Howard?-no, child!  Strange! and yet you are serious about it. You tremble, Jane." "Marriage with whom?" "Why, with your good friend,Sid, of course." Caroline would again have laughed, at being forced to so much, by Jane's determined blindness, but that her agitation both puzzled and alarmed her. Convictions of a dreadful misapprehension on her part.- of having allowed herself to be deceived by idle, ill-nature gossip; and induced to frame her deportment by its influences of having destroyed her own, and perhaps another's happiness, (for recolhections of ewry sad and tender look, tone, and. action of Howard's were with her now,) rushed    <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6890-00000041"/> 84      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN uoon her with overpowering energy. As soon as she was sufficiently composed, she told Caroline all-all she had heard, and all she had suf- fered. Alice was called in; and, as they expected, declared her inno- cence in regard to all communications respecting Howard's and Caroline's engagement. She had, indeed, been questioned on this point by several curious people, but declared herself ignorant of the matter of Howard's partiality, if, indeed, he felt any. She was asked, if he did not talk most, arnd most seriously, with Caroline; and with truth, answered in the afnfrmative. For a moment, Jane believed all she had heard to be equally unfounded-originating, not in deliberate falsehood, or in malice prepense, but in conjectures of little minds, which became, as they were circulated, matters of sober fact. "I can never forgive myself for my folly, and even wickedness; for I was betrayed into acting a most ungenerous, deceptive part;-but per- haps 't is well for me. I have learned a lesson worth a thousand times more than all this world's wisdom, and which, perhaps, suffering only could have taught me-a deep and humble sense of my dependence on God. I do feel, in my heart, sister, that without Him I can do nothing;- that if I had been guided by Him, instead of my own weak, erring judg- ment and impulses, I should have viewed the subject calmly; and with earnest prayers for correct conclusions and judicious conduct, how dif- ferently 1 should have acted --not merely in consequence of prayer, in- dependent of its elevating, purifying effects on the heart." Caroline was so agitated, she could not speak; and Jane continued: Cheerfulness of disposition-the habit of looking on the bright side, people call it-may sometimes serve one; but there are a thousand cir- cumstances in life, in which it will prove wholly ineffectual, if unregu- lated by religious principle." The bell rang, which called them to prayers; and they were no mean offerings, those dear girls brought that night to their Maker. Their father's thanks for mercies; his confessions of sinfulness, weakness, and dependence; and his pleadings for strength and wisdom from above-all met an answering thrill in their hearts; and they rose from their knees, with renewed trust, love, peace, and humility. CHAPTER XVI. MAAMNA, l9ok out, I tell you now; Mrs. Pons is coming down street just like a streak," said Susan Eastman, as she rushed into the sitting- room, upsetting two or three crickets and ottomans in her way. She was dragging a beautifully embroidered silk apron by the strings. "There, Netty, see your apron; ha, ha! you would have laughed. Kit had   THE EASTERN STATES.            85 been playing with it until she was all snarled up in the strings, I sup- pose; for the first-ha, ha!-the first I saw of her, she was rolling down stairs in it, frightened almost to death, poor thing. Why don't you take care of your things, Net? I'd make her, mamma." The mother smiled-good easy woman-as she always did at Jean- ette's mishaps; and so the poor girl had never yet been brought to feel that her. inadvertent habits were really a misfortune, rather than just causes of mirth. "There goes Mrs. Pons into Mrs. Herbert's. -It tickles me-that is the way she always goes, popping in, and popping out again. Net, she 'll be here in ten minutes; and you 'd better scrabble, I tell you now. See! ha!-bub has been biting your shoe, until his face is as nasty. Here, bright-eyed little rogue! give it me-there, Netty, now put it on- no; not slip-shod-there; now let me hook your dress-your cravat don't half cover the gap-Oh! how tight! I should think you would do something else, but just laugh and grow fatl and your stays are all out of kilter-lacing broke, and all full of knots-what makes you wear stays? the Ambrose girls don't, Mrs. Pens says. There, now you are pretty well harnessed." "Emeline, do lend me your handkerchief," said Jeanette, laughing. "I have lost mine; and I want something to cover this grease-spot on my apron." "Why not take your apron off?" "Oh! my dress is ten times worse. Do n't you remember how Jacob and I spattered ink all over it, in that last spree?" "Why, Jeanette! you ruin dresses faster than we can make them. You ought to be more careful; papa says he is growing poor every day," said Emeline.  "I know it; but we won't think about that. Susan, pass mamma's basket; I am going to be diligent now." "This will answer two good ends," said Mrs. Eastman; "keep you out of mischief, and your work will help us a great deal." "Would help you, mamma, if she'd hold out;" said Susan. "But, Net, you are just like Leonora, that my Sabbath-school book tells about. She roused herself up, and kept rousing herself up, to do great things, she thought; and by the time she got fairly to work, she was fairly used up. Her mamma told her she used all her--all her-I forget what- energy, I believe it was, in getting fairly to work. That's the way you do, Net; and so you do just nothing in the world, but help Zeke." "Nothing but help Zeke? What do you mean, Sue?" "Why, do n't you know, Net?-heard papa tell, as well as I; Why, old Mr. Webster-when they lived down here, at the lower village- went away one day, after stinting Zeke and Dan. Well, ivhen he came home, sure enough, the work was n't done. ' What have you been doing, Ezekiel?' said the old Mr. Webster, 'Nothing, father!'

But see! here is Mrs. Polls coming; and Netty, you ain't half done." Si'1h flew to arrange her hair. Oh, I never was so delighted!-and so anxious for poor Maria too!" '- \ lained Mrs. Pons, leaving half the questions put to her by Mrs. 1;.i-rman, unanswered. Why, wliat is the matter with Maria, Mrs. Pons? has she got dead, -, is she married?" asked Susan; but Mrs. Pons would scarcely have i (',dt'd the heaviest tocsin in Popedom, then. She threw herself into a clair ; and after drawing two or three long breaths, for purposes of :pprld, it seemed, she again set out. * It would be so delightful! but, as Mrs. Ambrose says, I fear it c*.n s all too late." *'What is it?" eagerly demanded Mrs. Eastman. ' Oh! I am so excited! I forgot, I had not told you all about it ;" ;,otilher long breath-" why, I have been in to Colonel Ambrose's-we 'e l,Iin very intimate lately-and while I was there, a letter came to the 1,.'(,ncl, from our friend Howard, that threw them into a terrible panic; air\l no wonder-I only got a part of it-we were all so flustered! but 1 1:now what it amounts to Mr. Howard has ascertained some way- t'i, re was something about a pencil-case Maria gave him here-and ;J!,ut their neighbors' descriptions, &amp;c., I believe-that Maria Hayes is P'1 Fanny Howard, herself--ister to our Mr. Howard-named for I5I:.. Ambrose-with half a million, nearly." She lifted both hands, n D was greeted by a simultaneous burst of surprise from her auditors; ,i ,t even excepting the precocious little Susan, who stood by Jeanette, a.-anging hir hair. "Yes ;" continued, Mrs. Pons, " only think! what an a\\ ful thing! Mrs. Hayes-somehow I can 't help pitying the woman-but sit (dleserves terrible punishment, for carrying the poor girl off, especially." Mrs. Eastman again lifted both hands; Jeanette rocked the more as- silLi,usly, and Emeline with difficulty restrained her tears. I)o you suppose she feared detection?" she asked. Yes, no doubt of it, they all think; but I think as Mrs. Sprague dfns-and what a good, devoted saint, she is-I think some terrible juldglment will follow her, go where she will."  Why, how does it happen? how has she been concealed?" "Why, I could n't get all the particulars; but, someway I can always g(rt a great deal from a little, and yet be correct;-I have often sur- pri.,ed myself in this-and Fanny says, if my lot had been cast in Greece or RIme, in their palmy days, L should have been worshipped as a sybil; and if in the days of Salem witchcraft, . should have been burnt or Inllll, a a witch; and if in the times of chivalry, my reputation as a weird woman, might have rivalled that of Mag Moluc. But, poor Maria! she is n't out of my mind a moment. What were you inquiring about, Mrs. Eastman? Oh! I know; as I said, I could n't get all the particu.   THE EASTERN STATES.            837 tars; but-she-why she was put with a nurse in her mother's illness- 'her nurse's daughter, of hers-that is, Maria's, or rather Fanny's age, died; and Mrs. Hayes, or Haines was her true name, ran off with the little Fanny. The discovery comes, some way, from-oh! I told you about the pencil-case; that, and. a bosom-pin and ring, those splendid things she wore, you know-were-or happened to be in a box of cloth. ing, sent with the little Fanny, to Mrs. Hayes, or Mrs. Haines. And there is some safer clue, in the complexions of the two children, &amp;c. But I must be going. Mr. Howard says he shall find his sister, if in human means. I shall always rejoice, when I think that I was the means of introducing her into notice here; she was a delightful creature -I saw from the first-so pleasant, and elegant! Oh! and Mr. Howard mentions that this discovery has given his mother's already feeble health a severe shock. I feel so for them, I do n't know what to-do ;-and the  colonel's folks feel as bad, I do believe, as if she was their own child and sister; and no wonder, they are such public-spirited people, and she is such a charming girl. But I declare I must go. I have several more calls to make, and I must get home in season to see to dinner." So, then, there is an end to all things. All this time there had been only space for the insertion of an occasional-" yes," from Mrs. Eastman, or "sure enough!" from Jeanette, and an " oh, my!" from Susan. "Fanny is at home, is n't she?" asked Mrs. Eastman. "Yes; but she is a mere child lately, in domestic matters. You know she reads, plays her piano, draws, paints, and does all such things; and some way such girls are never worth much about the house. They are always afraid of soiling their hands, or clothes-or, generally-  Mrs: Ambrose and her daughters manage differently.. She says now she is growing old, and her daughters are young and vigorous, it is for them to take the heaviest part of the family cares and toils ;-next to Alice, I sup- pose, though she did not say so. She is always 'right about such things. But who has her tact? And her daughters are just like her. They all manage to do all sorts of farmer-wQrk, without making such horrible drudges of themselves as some ladies do by such means. I have some- times thought it is done by their not being ashamed to do anything that is useful and necessary; but by respecting themselves the more for being well employed. And so they maintain a dignity and gentility really charming. 'T is as Professor Bancroft says-they have the tact of doing in ungenteel thing genteelly-and this is delightful. Fanny is different. She is mortified to death, almost, if she is caught doing anything but dling." "Well, there is a great deal of difference in girls about such things," said Mrs. Eastman, yawning. . I never thought of it before; .but, now, )ur Emeline does more work in a day than Jeanette does in a week, or, I night say, in a month; but you know she--" "Well, mother," interrupted Jeanette, laughing-" well, you know it s n't because I am afraid of soiling my clothes and hands; for I never    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6890-00000043"/> 88      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN feel so well as when I plunge head and ears into some bad job-washing, sifting meal, picking chickens, or anything that makes a perfect fright of me.  Ha, ha! and emptying feathers and filling a bed-ah, there is rtothing like it, especially if one has a black mering dress to put on, as I have. But I am sick of it in just five minutes. Then I want to run into Mrs. Cummings's and Mrs. Herbert's back doors, set them all to laughing at mle, and then run home, look up in a glass, and then sit down in a rocking-chair to laugh at myself. You laugh at me, Mrs. Pons; but you may depend on it, there is nothing like it. Give my love to Fanny, and tell her to try it, if she wants rare comfort." Mrs. Pons laughed; but her brow was soon clouded by recollections of Maria. She sighed-rose in a hurried manner-and took leave. * What she said was indeed true. She conjectured much of it; but so accustomed was she to generalizing from particulars, that she seldom failed in point of correctness. All acquitted her of mischievous intentions in this, yet the really prudent kept a constant watch upon themselves whlln in her presence, unless thrown from their guard by surprise-as were the Ambroses in the present instance-or by some other cause. In compliance with Howard's request, the colonel made every exertion in his power to learn the retreat of thes fugitives. The driver who took tlhem from Franklin, could trace them no farther than Haverhill, where he left them. He wrote to Pickwacket-the only town they had been lieard to mention. The postmaster could ascertain nothing subsequent t,) their removal to New-England, six months previous. With a sad heatt, Mr. Ambrose communicated his failure to Howard. Every line of his reply breathed the most bitter disappointment. He dreaded its effects on his mother's health; for she seemed completely prostrated by the shock. Her message to Mrs. Ambrose was: "Tell her to pray for her poor heart-broken friend-that she may have strength from above to sus. tain her. And, oh! tell her to bless God at every breath, that her hus- band and children are spared to her. She knows not the blessed mercy (f the dispensation." And Mrs. Ambrose did bless God. She did pray in anxious and a. io-t despairing fervor, for her beloved and severely tried friend. She wrote, urging her to bear herself up for her son's sake, and for the sake of all those friends whose peace was bound up in hers; and to come to thenm. and remain while Howard prosecuted his researches for her daugh. ier. But, alas! for Mrs. Howard! her spirit had been too many times lowered down, to spring now with ease to its wonted position. She con- tinned very ill during the winter; and, meanwhile, her son seldom left her hbdside, except for occasional communications to the Ambroses and Mr. Flanders. It was decided that Mr. Flanders should accompany him to Canada, as soon as Mrs. Howard could travel. He'was most sanguine in his hopes of finding his aunt there, by means of advertisements, if all other things failed. His hopes infused new courage into Mrs. Howard; and now that her son was to have such a companion, her repugnance to his   THE EASTERN STATES.            89 plan of personal search was half gone. Her health began to mend, but so tardily, that it was late in the spring before her physician would- allow her to travel. In accordance with his advice, they were to visit Saratoga first, and remain there a short time for the benefit of the spring-waters. By assignation, Flanders and his family were to meet them there. Hence Mrs. Howard was to be attended by the latter, via'New-York and Bos. ton, at which places friends of theirs resided, to Franklin; and Howard and Flanders were to proceed immediately to Canada. Mrs. Howard's heart sunk within her, as she slowly relinquished her son's hand, after he had placed her in the carriage that was to take her from him. But as she proceeded, her sadness-gradually yielded, in a de- gree, to the intelligence of Mr. Flanders, his wife and daughter, to their efforts to divert her, and to the influences of new scenes. They travelled by easy stages, and stopped for the examination of things pleasing and  curious, en route. But not long had any of these the power to cheat her into complete forgetfulness of her children. The friends-Mrs. Ambrose and Mis. Howard-had been prepared to witness changes in each other's appearance; still they were shocked at first-especially Mrs. Ambrose-by the faded and wan looks of her once beautiful Martha. They wept in each other's arms. Healthy employ- ment, regular habits, and a life of almost unclouded serenity, had spared Mrs. Ambrose many of the tokens of age, found on her less fortunate Afriend. Yet changed she was, since Mrs. Howard saw her a sprightly girl of sixteen. "But I should have known you," said Mrs. Howard. "Yes, you are less changed than I thought at first. Your eyes and mouth wear the same expression of quiet, but heart-felt enjoyment. Your forehead has much of the fairness, and your cheek the glow and roundness of your former days-and that smile! oh! 't is just like my old playmate and comforter, Fanny Hall. Strange! is it not, Mrs. Ambrose? A superficial observer would have thought me the oak, and you the slender reed that finds sup. port in its trunk, and comfort in its shade. But very different it was; and even now I seem as if resting, after years of weariness-as if ush. ered into some loved, all-sufficient presence, after years of loneliness. Ah, my friend! yours is a blessed lot--to be all your life happy, and con- ferring solid happiness on others." Mrs. Howard had dispatched a note,to Mrs. Ambrose while at Boston, informing her on what day they would arrive at Franklin; but owing to a careless detention on the route, it was not received until the day of their arrival, and after they had accepted the " compliments, and would spend the next afternoon with them if they were not engaged," of the Mrs. Law- rence, Cummings, Pons, Herbert, and their daughters. Invitations had been extended to others, so that quite a gathering was anticipated. Mrs. Howard shrunk from the efforts she must make to sustain herself in a party of strangers, until Mrs. Ambrose guarantied her all the privi. leges of an invalid.' Nothing could equal the delight of Mrs. Pons's    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6890-00000044"/> 90      JENNY AMBROSE; GR, LWFE IN expectations. She heard from a neighbor, who happened to be at the colo- nel's at the time of the arrival of their visitors, that Mrs. Howard was a glo- rious woman-all velvet, satin, and lace. To please a woman of that sort, she concluded would require no small amount of exertion at her toilet; and it was amusing to see the elaborate display of obsolete jewels and finery she nresented. Even Mrs. Eastman and Jeanette were somewhat aroused from their accustomed lethargy. The latter spent fullfive minutes in the ar- rangement of her hair. By much entreaty, she was induced to put on a new pair of shoes, although, as she declared before leaving home, and after she reached Mr. Ambrose's, there was no other thing in the world she hated so much, excepting work. Mrs. Cummings had been much in soci- ety; she knew that good, intelligent people were pretty much the same, the world over; and could not bring herself to feel any uncommon soli- citude about this occasion. In fitting themselves for their part in society, Mrs. Herbert and her daughter aimed not so much to adorn the body, as to enrich and beautify the mind-to lay up there, funds from which to draw for pleasing and profitable conversation. They were much loved, and their society was much sought by the best part of the community; but not fron their gaudy or rich apparel, with which money may clothe a fool-as saith Emerson's spelling-book. Quite as a matter of course, Miss Fanny Pons came in full dress; and it was strange-surprising- she thought, that a lady so elegantly attired as Mrs. Howard, should meet her advances with such chilling politeness; and, almost at the same mo- nlent, enter into a familiar chat with Sara Herbert, who was in a calico dress-a neat and highly becoming one, true-yet nothing but calico forsooth! Mrs. Pens moved about like a troubled spirit, taking especial pains to say pleasant things to every one that came'in her way, until she hit upon a vacancy by the side of Mrs. Howard. "We owe you much for this gratification, Mrs. Howard," said she, considerably embarrassed, between her consciousness of vanity of pur- pose, and her fears of using her favorite epithets-delightful and pleasant, which Fanny had just proscribed, with the assurance that they utterly spoilt her conversation. But she was none the less determined in her plan, of making Mrs. Howard understand just how pleasant she was, and how benevolent:-how she had liked her son, and patronized her daughter, &amp;c. &amp;c. Mrs. LHoward bowed slightly, and looked steadily in her face, as if wait- ing to learn to what this was the exordium. "W 'e are all deli-happy to see you, as the mother of our charming friends, Howard and the dear Maria, or rather Fanny. Poor girl! I have felt so for her! and for you too, madam;-it must have been such a trial for a fond mother!" There! Mrs. Pons had put herself well under weigh. Of course, she talked steadily an hour--and yet she did not; for when she launched at length into conjectures about how Howard would some day marry Jane, and about how delighted Fanny would be--she had fbr-   THE EASTERN STATES.            91 gotten Fanny's lesson, in her pleased excitemlent-she raised her eye and met a withering look from that young lady. It was a startling twinge that same look gave to Mrs. Pons's approbativeness. She concluded in  an embarrassed way, and in a few moments followed Mrs. Eastman from the room, to inform her that her cravat *as falling from her shoulders- that a bunch of her cap-trimmings was unfastened, and that her collar was turned half round. Mrs. Howard turned to Caroline. "Well, Miss Ambrose, I too had some very pleasant speculations upon results that might come of his long stay here, and his high regard for you and your sister. They differed from that lady's, however, in objects. Jane was the heroine of her imaginings, it seems: I had several reasons for employing you. He wrote and talked most of you-with the excep- tion, indeed, of his first letters. By way of confirming my hopes, I ral- lied him upon the subject; and in reply, he informed me of your engage. ment to a gentleman here. And,"-she lowered her voice, and her air of pleasantry gave way to a troubled look-" and there is an entanglement in Virginia-so, at least, the lady's family have positively assured me. She is certainly beautiful, and accomplished too; and well-connected," she added, musingly; " but then there are circumstances in the case, which I shouid have hoped would be a barrier to her marriage with Frank. I have approached the subject several times, but he sedulously avoids it. She sighed deeply, as she concluded, and proposed retiring to walk in the shrubbery, back of the house. Jane was at a flower-stand near, with Fanny Pons, who was discours- ing about a new plant; and endeavoring to decide with correctness, by a course of logical, philosophical pros and cons, whether said plant was, in reality, a prithee geranium, rock daisy, or feather-plant-for each of these titles, she knew, were appropriated to it in different places. Mean- time, Jane occasionally nodded, shook her head, or smiled perforce, in the most mechanical way in the world. But scarce a word did she hear, shy was so absorbed in the conversation of Mrs. Howard and Caroline-not a syllable of which escaped her ear.' Well! so it was nothing to her if Mr. Howard would soon be there, to receive her better hospitalities, and her acknowledgments. Indeed, she thought it would be better to make no acknowledgments; for she had few, if any reasons, for supposing there had been any misapprehensions on her part, with regard to his opinions of herself. And be that as it might, he would be indifferent now about her intentions; and only anxious to exchange them for those of his Vir- ginia love. So far Jane had mused, when she was aroused by a laugh, and a call to her from the piazza. Jeanette was there alone. Th1e girl had entangled herself fairly, and purposely, in the thorns of a tall rose- tree, and the tendrils of a woodbine, that scrambled up a pillar of the piazza near; and her musical laugh was ringing out loud enough to be heard all about the village. On getting fairly released, her hair was all about her face and ears, a sleeve of her muslin dress was torn, and her    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6890-00000045"/> 92      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN hands and face were scratcnea. Happy was she; for she walked into the house, set them all-even Mrs. Sprague, among the rest-laughing at her, and then placed herself before a large mirror, fbr the purpose, as she said, of having a good time laughing at herself. Had she been ugly in face or form, the deformity, when she put herself into such a plight, -would have been complete, and consequently revolting, instead of ludicrous. But her full, fair face was really beautiful, except that it lacked the expression common to her years. Her form, too, had a deli- cacy and elasticity which could not be concealed by the most uncouth attire; and all her movements were as easy and playful as a child's. Unfortunate for Jeanette that they were so; else, she had met reproof instead of laughter: and this mischievous fault would not have been per- petuated, a speck upon the diamond's surface. CHAPTER XVII. "ETTERS came from our travellers, dated at Pickwacket, and many other towns in Canada and in the State of Vermont, written while awaiting the results of issuing advertisements and agents; but no tidings of the fugi- tives. At length, one dated at Burlington stated that, despairing of suc- cess, they would, on the following day, bend their course to Franklin. They proposed returning by a circuitous route, taking Niagara and Sara- toga in their way-partly for the sake of again seeing those places, but much more in the hope of diverting their minds from their disappoint- ment, and allowing Mrs. Howard time to recover the first shock before their meeting. It would be in vain to attempt a description of Mrs. Howard's disap- pointment. Her kind friends did all for her that love and sympathy could (do; but she sunk under it. Her rhind seemed suddenly to have lost all its elasticity, her nervous system to have been completely prostrated, her whole system to have received a fatal shock. The colonel and his wife accompanied her to Hopkinton, and to the houses of several in Concord, who had been her associates at school-with the hope that new scenes and pleasant reminiscences would give her mind a healthful spring. In the meantime, how was it with Jane?. Why, she was pale and sad, but perfectly calm. Yet she dreaded the approaching meeting. "Were that over," she thought, twenty times in a day-"( were that over, I could neet all the rest calmly." It was early evening; and Mrs. Howard, in a rich, white dishabille, was reclining languidly on a sofa, in the darkened parlor. Jane sat at ner side on a low ottoman, with one small, fair arm encircling Mrs. How- ard's waist, and one of her hands clasped in her own. The colonel sat   THE EASTERN STATES.            93 in his easy chair near a window, from which he occasionally moved the curtain a little, while he read, without comprehending it, a paragraph in the last "Journal." Mrs. Ambrose sat near him, holding a small bible, she had been reading. Her eyes were fixed with anxious solicitude on the face of her poor friend. Caroline sat at the piano, and, ever anon, listlessly ran the keys through a strain or two of some melancholy air. Mrs. Howard had been a long time silent, and when at length she spoke, she evinced what had been the burden of her thoughts: "Yes; to mor- row, it may be, Frank and his frind will be here." A shudder passed over ner frame. "And then you will be happier, dear Mrs. Howard," said Jane, in her tender earnestness, bending her face nearer Mrs. Howard's. Mrs. Howard shook her head hopelessly. "Life is so short," pursued Jane, " and you will so soon meet all your lost ones in Heaven; your union there will be sweeter, it seems to me, from your having reached it through much tribulation." "My sweet young comforter!" exclaimed Miss Howard, "you have indeed shown me things in their true light; for what are the sufferings of the brief period we call life, compared with the never-ending felicities we shall enjoy while ' drawing the breath of the true life.'" All were affected. Mrs. Howard flung her arm round Jane's neck, and pressed her lips to her cheek. Just at that moment, Frederic usher- ed in Howard. One half hour before, the meeting so suddenly would have completely overcome Mrs. Howard; and Jane, too, would fiave suffered. But their feelings had just been chastened and subdued into a calm not easily broken by the most startling incidents. Mrs. Howard clasped her son in her arms, and kissed his brow. "' The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away!" said sh'e, as she turned her eyes, glowing in the light ot faith and trust, to his agitated face. He turned from her to Jane, clasped her hand in his, and pressed it hurriedly to his lips. His meeting with the colonel, his wife, and Caroline, was touch. ingly tender. Jane alone was perfectly calm, self-possessed and digni- fied. Even when she raised her'eyes, and they met those of Howard, fixed upon her face with their wonted expression of inquiry and sadness, hers did not fall. Higher emotions than earthly love or earthly fear filled her heart, and infused a sweet serenity into her whole appearance, "Well, my son, your mission has failed," said Mrs. Howard, in a  tremulous tone. "But while you are spared to me and these dear friends, I ought not to repine. And this sweet child "-taking Jane's hand--" has twined herself about my affections so strongly, that I would scarcely value a seven-years' servitude, if she might be my reward." "And then, my mother, if you might have your Fanny, too," said Howard ;-his voice was almost choked with emotion evidently delight- ful. Mrs. Howard looked earnestly and quickly in his face. 'i You have not found my child! Oh! speak, in mercy, or my head-" she clasped her hands. and then caught his arm. y2    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6890-00000046"/> "      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN "Yes! dear mother, your sufferings are at an end. We have found her!" "My God, I thank thee!" she exclaimed; and bursting into tears, she sank hack into Jane's arms. In answer to their inquiries, Howard informed them that he had left his sister with Mr. Flanders, at the hotel. They were to follow him, as soon ns ihe had had time to prepare his mother for her reception. "And here they are now," said the colonel, stepping forward to con. lcl(t tlbeln.            J The agitated Fanny sprang past him into the parlor, and, with a con- vulsive shriek, threw herself into her mother's arms, which were opened to receive her. They seemed to forget that there were others in exist- ence. Again and again, Mrs. Howard held her daughter out from her, looked earnestly in her face, and then in smiles or tears-for they were strolling together-she clasped her in her arms and kissed her cheek. Fanny was evidently shocked by the pale face and shadowy form of her mot he r. "Mv poor, poor mother!" said she, in a voice of such pity and ten- dlerness, that it drew tears to the eyes of all present. She suddenly re- collected herself, and turned to the rest of her friends. Her meeting with them, especially with Jane, was but little less tender than with her nother. "Now, my friend-sister-everything-now your generous heart will be rewarded for your kindness to a poor, ignorant outcast, by seeing her happy in a mother's and a brother's love." Jane could only answer by again kissing her. Mr. Flanders had been almost entirely overlooked; still, he forbade all apologies. In preparing supper for the travellers, and in making arrangements for the accommodation of their new guests, all the family were soon en. arred. Howard went out for the purpose of taking a solitary stroll, and visiting loved haunts in the yard, garden and shrubbery. Judging that the mother and daughter would like to be left to a free interchange of thoughts, Flanders rose for the purpose of repairing to the sitting-room. He hesitated, and turned round to Fanny. She rose, smiled, and extended her hand to him. "Mother, you must help me to be grateful to this dear friend-cousin I can call you no longer, William." Flanders took her hand in both of his. "But, my dear Fanny, there is a sweeter name by which I would love to have you call me." Fanny trembled and turned pale. Flanders encircled her waist with his arm, and gently drew her to his side. 'He, too, was excessively agi- tated. "Oh, my dear Mrs. Howard, let me urge you to take to your heart yet another child, who will love you and watch over your comfort, and thus put a seal to my happiness." Mrs. Howard smiled and turned toward Fanny. "And to my happiness, too, dear mother," said she, the ingenuous blood rising to her face.   'THE EAS I'ER N STATES.          9 ' Yes, my children, with pride and pleasure. I feel that I cannot be sufficiently grateful, Fanny, that you gave your affections to the only being I knew, with whom I would be perfectly willing to divide my em. pire in your heart." Mrs. Howard pressed their united hands in hers as she spoke. Flan. 7 ders took Fanny to his heart, kissed her cheek, and then hurried from the room. CHAPTER XVIII. ITMMEDIATELY upon leaving Burlington, the friends bent their course to Niagara. They stopped to spend the night at Buffalo. On their return from a ramble, their attention was arrested by the wildest, sweetest voice that ever broke from mortal throat, singing "Home." They look- ed in the direction of the sound, and saw a young Indian girl, decked from head to foot with the gayest ornaments of Indian and European cos- tume. The street she was walking intersected theirs, and they stopped at the crossing until she came up. She looked up as she approached; but immediately dropped her eyes, in real or pretended modesty-it seemed the former. .Just as passing them, she commenced singing the "Mountain Bugle." "Heavens!" they both exclaimed, starting as if by an electric shock. "How much like Maria's peculiar manner of singing it," said Mr. Flanders. They acknowledged to each other the idleness of the curiosity; still, they felt unable to restrain it. They followed the girl. "Maiden, will you tell me from whom you learnt the 'Mountain Bu- gle?'" inquired Flanders. "Of Snow-Flake, me call her; for light and pure is her spirit as the feathery flakes that were falling fast on her cot when we met; and she smiled upon her dark sister Orooka." '"Snow-Flake? and what did others call her?" "Maria-Maria Hayes." The agitation of the friends at this intelligence, can better be conceived than described. They inquired farther, learned Maria's residence; and after expressing their thanks, and offering the girl a piece of gold, which she declined with a somewhat haughty air, they turned to their lodgings. It will readily le conjectured, that this was the same Indian girl men. tioned in a former part of the work. She was then returning to her tribe, in which her father held no mean rank, after spending the fashion. able season at Saratoga. She spent some days with Maria then. More disgusted than ever with the customs of her people, and lured too, by the rich presents of clothing and jewels; by the attentions of the ladies, and    <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6890-00000047"/> 96      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN the flatteries of the gentlemen; by her love of novelty; and, at the same time, by longings for an element more congenial to her lofty and delicate spirit, than the wilds of Canada, she left her home on the following spring, for the purpose of visiting Saratoga. She visited Maria by the way. Maria would gladly have retained her with her. She loved the artless, noble creature; and she dreaded the corrupting influences she would meet at Saratoga. But Orooka could not be induced to relinquish her plan; she, however, promised strict ad- herence to Maria's advice about the regulation of her deportment while there. Howard and Flanders started very early on the following morning; and after a forced ride of fifty miles, over horrid roads, they reached Georgetown, the town where Mrs. Hayes resided. There was a miser- able village, two miles, the Indian girl informed them, from her residence. On entering it, they saw a funeral party alight from wagons at the en- trance of a graveyard. The villagers of both sexes, and all ages, were gathered about the yard and open grave. Partly to obtain necessary directions respecting their course, and partly to witness the simple but affecting spectacle, they alighted and mingled with the crowd. There were but two mourners, it appeared-a female, in deep mourning, and a venerable, white-haired gentleman, on whose arm she was leaning. Others followed them, but apparently neighbors only. The lady was tall and graceful, closely veiled, richly attired; and as unlike the rough beings around her, as a tender and splendid tropical exotic, to the ruggid, stinted flower of the mountain side. After observing her a moment in silence, the eyes of the travellers met with mutual expressions of doubt and inquiry. "Ah!" exclaimed a by-stander, with a long sigh, "'t is but a sorry life the old woman has led, as they tell. But she's got home to glory now, no doubt; for, by what our minister says, she's like the thief on the cross-like the man that came at the 'leventh hour-like the prodigal son-and like-" "Lor, father! don't go on so," said a youthful Amazon, at his side. "What a picter her darter is! If I didn't know, I should think she come right straight down from the clouds; should n't you, Jule?" Yes; it does one's soul good to look at her, to see her step-every. thing she does is so lady-like. 'T is like the swing of the branches of that handsome tree there-like seeing a deer bound over the rocks and hills-like . " "There, there, Jule! you are just like father; always full of your likes.

"They say Lawyer Maf- fit has lit on her to make a wife of her; amnd-- " he was here interrupted by the lady's sobbing, as the clod struck the coffin. Howard and Flanders could no longer restrain their impatient   THE EASTERN STATES.            97 curiosity; they rushed forward through the crowd to the grave. The lady-it was Maria-saw them, started, flung back her veil, and with a half suppressed shriek, fell into the arms of Flanders, who sprang for- ward to her support. She was already worn out by her toils, her grief, and her anxieties. This meeting, so sudden, unexpected and welcome, quite overcame her, and she nearly fainted. "Cousin-brother!" she faintly ejaculated, extending her hand to Howard. The good old clergyman-the white-haired gentleman, who supported Maria-raised his dull, weak eyes to Heaven, and then bent them on the strangers. "Peace be with ye, strangers; for ye bring peace to the or- phan, I trust," said he. Tears fell fast from the females, who stood near enough to comprehend the meaning of this scene; and rough, dark men, drew their toil-hardened hands across their eyes, to hide their sympathy. "Ha! I should like pretty fair to have 'Squire Maffit see this! I guess 't would make him think of what I told him. 'I never see a girl,' says I, 'that had just her bewitching ways, that wan't as ugly as sin.' .He was  as mad as a halter. I tell y! but I guess he'd be after believing it if he was here now. She. puts on such smart-feeling ways! she goes into the meeting-house, always, as though the floor wa'n't good enough for her to go on. I told 'Squire Maffit-says I,' if you marry her, you 'll just have to go to carpeting your floor, that's all.'" Thus spoke a short, dumpy body, whose'face was all fat, freckles, and perspiration; whose foot was like a pudding bag; and whose short waist was bounded, on one side, by a nicely-starched cotton tucker-the re- mains of one of Esquire Maffit's rufflds-and on the other, by a broad, flaming, red and yellow belt-ribbon, compressed in some parts into a string. She was the daughter of Mynheer Broek, him of the village-inn, whose house was the residence of Esquire Maffit, while he was looking about him for a lucrative post. In one of his peregrinations, he came upon Mrs. Hayes's cottage; and a sight of its junior occupant determined his purpose of remaining, pro tempore, at least, at the village of Georgetown. This would have delighted Miss Ruby Broek, but that she entertained suspicions as to "the moving why" he did it, founded upon his inquiries about Miss Hayes, and his rapturous extollations of her beauty. i And then, he suddenly betook himself to long walks, for his hcalth's sake, ostensibly; but in reality to exhibit his glossy beaver, and his suit of broadcloth, which, he well knew, contrasted admirably with the homemade costume of" the natives." "'But, Lawyer Maffit, what the deuce makes you al'ers walk one way? the tother road is pleasantest, everybody knows," said Van Broek, 'chuckling, and giving "Lawyer Maffit" a tremendous slap upon his shoulder. Maffit laughed in a way that he meant should be perfectly intelligible, strutted largely across the sanded floor, which the now irritated Ruby had swept in a fanciful way, in diamonds, squares, circles, herring bones, and    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6890-00000048"/> 98      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN trees, the circumference of whose fruit exceeded that of the trunks, and all this, with an eye single to Lawyer Maffit's admiration. 'Twas provoking, Ruby; and so thou didst appear to think, when he put that climax to his dignity and consequence, by wheeling half round on his heel; meanwhile thrusting his right arm beneath the skirt of his coat, and ensconcing the thumb of his left hand in the arm-hole of his vest. "Oh, my.! I'd like masterly well to box his ears for him, that's a fact," muttered she, as she snapped a large stick she had been twisting, and threw it out of a window. "So important!" and she looked omi- nously at Lawyer Maffit, and then at his pet Towser. Maffit saw it all, but only laughed the louder. The puppy! was n't he, Ruby? "Why," answered he, at length-"- why, you know the other road is somewhat hilly-at least, more so than the one that leads out Mrs. Hayes's way." "MArs. Hayes's way! oh, Lor!" said Ruby. "I guess we know a thing or two. Lor! did n't I heal father say, t' other day, that man or beast could go easier where 't was a part of the way up hill? and did n't you say 't was 'cause the musketers, or sonthing of that sort?-you need n't grin,' sir!-did n't you say them things, whatever they be, a part worked up hill, and a part down, so that they could all rest if 't was hilly? did n't you?" "Ha, Ruby! you are too hard on me-decidedly too hard. You are sharp enough for a lawyer. The laugh with which he wheeled round to leave the room, was as loud as he could possibly render it.  "Lor!" screamed Ruby. "Thunder!" said Maffit, turning round in pretended terror. Miss Ruby gave old Towser a wrathful kick; and he ran howling from the house. "There, Ruby! that answered finely for reverberations; but, contrary to the common order of nature, the flash comes last." Again he laughed; and, leaving the house immediately, walked directly toward Mrs. Hayes's. He had managed to introduce himself to Mrs. Hayes and Maria; and presuming upon the fineness of his cloth, and his Esquireship, he com- menced his suit to Maria. She repulsed him in undisguised contempt, so gross and palpable were his vanity and selfishness. His self-esteem led him to impute this to the diffidence of the girl, and so persevered in his attentions. Most assiduous were they during Mrs. Hayes's illness; for he had begun to consider his success as indispensable to his happiness. As Maria commanded, he maintained a strict silence with regard to his wishes; but he watched for opportunities of serving her, by those offices which her cares, or her sex, rendered her incapable of performing for her- self. Mrs Hayes's mental sufferings were such as to distress Maria, beyond conception. She could not endure to have Maria out of her sight a   THE EASTERN STATES.            99 -- moment; and yet, when she fixed her eyes on her face, as she often did, \  it seemed that the emotions which shook her frame must destroy her.- / The good minister of the village sought in vain to soothe her to peage/ :? The sinfulness of one act, the neglect to take up, when it was mostr her' duty, the heaviest part of the cross, were the burden of all her convic- tions. But when assured by the physician that she could survive no longer, all struggles were at an end. "Come to-morrow, Mr. Lawrence," said she to her minister, as he took up his hat to leave her-" come to-morrow, and I will tell you all-yes; and why did I ever care? They could but strip my darling from me, and put this poor body in prison ;-but 't was no more than I deserved- not so much as I deserved-no!" Maria knew not whether to expect the revelation of some dreadful crime, or to suspect her mother of aberration of intellect. But many things, such as she let fall in the conversation just related, made her tremblingly anxious about her communications, whatever they might be. At an early hour the next day, Mr. Lawrence repaired to the cottage. Mrs. Hayes requested Maria to bring writing materials, that Mr. Lawrence might write as she dictated. "There, now, Mari, my poor child, go to your room. You 'll soon know all. Yes, I shall hold out but a little longer; and I could n't meet your loving eye after I had told you all." Maria's tears fell upon her mother's face as she arranged her pillows; and she turned back, after closing the door, to beg her mother not to fatigue herself. She then went to her own room; and almost breathless with apprehension, she flung herself on her knees to weep and pray. She was aroused, after a long interval, by the opening of her mother's door. Daughter," said Mr. Lawrence; and Maria hastened to the spot. The countenances of Mr. Lawrence and' Mrs. Hayes bore traces of vio. lent emotion; but they were then calm. "Let us pray," said Mr. Lawrence. He and Maria knelt together by the bed; and long and earnestly did he wrestle for the sick one, and for " the daughter." Maria looked up to her mother once; her hands were clasped upon her bosom, and her eyes were raised up to Heaven in supplication. When they rose, the spirit had fled; and an expression of calmness and peace had settled upon her fea- tures. "Gone home-borne on the wings of prayer!" exclaimed Mr. Law- rence, clasping his hands in christian exultation. - Two of the nearest neighbors had entered, while they were at prayers. To these, Mr. Lawrence, and the housekeeper, Maria, resigned the melan. choly task of preparing for the burial; and in compliance with the reite. rated request of Mr. Lawrence, who hoped; by the means, to arouse her from the gloomy torpor that seemed settling upon her, she went to her room to read the papers he had drawn up.    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6890-00000049"/> 100      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN With the principal facts the reader has already been made acquainted; and with many of the trials to which a consciousness of her guilt exposed her. Her detail of these, her prayers for forgiveness from Maria and Heaven, rung every fibre of Maria's heart. She stated, that when she fbrmed her plan of escape with Mrs. Howard's infant, she was almost distracted by the loss of her own only darling; that she had no expecta- tions, then, of Mrs. Howard's long surviving her husband, or of her recov- ering her reason, if she was spared; that if she did, she had yet other children, while herself had none. The result of these speculations is known. She remained at the west until the frequency of migrations from the middle States, led her to fear detection; and then they removed to Canada. By the purchase of a wild lot on going west, by its improvement, and by its sale subsequently, when a village of considerable importance had started up near, Mr. Ilayes amassed quite a fortune. But not a farthing was expended in improving their condition, further than in the purchase of comparative ease. He was a meek man, completely passive under his wife's most tyrannical impositions, although his conscience and his natural tastes would have induced a line of proceedings totally different from that marked out by his wife. He would have given Maria the advantages of society and education; but Mrs. Hayes scouted the idea in infinite scorn-it was so plain that these privileges, aided by her beauty and elegance, would lead to suspicions, if not to a disiovery, of her parentage. By-and-by, Mr. Haves sickened and died. In their isolated situation, upon a cold, barren soil, and upon a spot exposed to all the bitter rigors of a northern winter, Mrs. Hayes saw the impracticability of remaining; and longing once more to see her aged mother, if living, she repaired to Fraaklin. But her mother died many years before, leaving her little cottage, its contents, and a garden, to her daughter, if she came to claim it; if not, subject to the discretionary disposal of her agent. Mrs. Hayes felt many misgiv. ings about remaining there, founded upon the improved state of society there. She dreaded its effect on Maria; but, at length, determined on running her weird. By pretending great poverty, and living secluded; by keeping Maria constantly employed, constantly harassed, and degraded by her provocations, she hoped to avoid what she dreaded above all things-the loss of Maria, and the punishment of herself; and the former came not from her love of the girl, but from the principle by which the wretched, tattered, shivering miser clutches closer his glittering treasure, the longer he watches it, and the more anxiety its accumulation and re. tention cost him. Then came feeble health, renewed fears of detection- growing out of Maria's intercourse with Howard-and better feelings for her child, and dread of losing her society. Under these influences she left Franklin. But she still found herself in the condition described by Milton: "Which way I fly is hell--mylf am hell."   THE EASTERN STATES.           101 I Maria understood just how Mrs. Hayes had been led on, step by step, from a single act of injustice, perpetrated when her loss had nearly de. prived her of her reason. She thought of her tenderness toward her during the last year; of her sufferings, repentance, and death-and she could find in her heart no sentiments but tenderness and affection. But when she thought of her own mother, her brother, of Flanders-her cousin no longer, yet, how dear to her !-of the prospect of meeting them and her Franklin friends so soon, how wildly her heart beat! how the blood Xrushed through her veins ! And when the last rite of affection for her mother had been performed, when Howard and Flanders had rewarded the good clergyman and the neighbors for their kindness to her; and when she had turned with them from the scenes of her late sufferings, she felt as if her happiness were something tangible, taking a firm hold upon her heart. Hitherto, when her. sky was clear, she invariably found herself' instinctively looking round for some dark cloud, that was prepa- ring to break upon her head. Now, she felt a sense of perfect safety and permanent peace, which was as novel as it was delightful to her. " Do you know, Maria," said Flanders, when he and Maria were left alone, while Howard took a moonlight ramble by the beautiful little lake in Canaan, where they had stopped for the night-" do you know, I some. times fear that even ' the cousin's room' you had in your heart for me, .will soon be filled by new objects ?" '"No, no, never, William! You were as kind as an angel to me, when you saw me an ignorant, poor, despised being. You gave me knowledge andi happiness-for 't is true, that to you I am indebted for all the happiness I have ever enjoyed; and I shall always feel a gratitude to you I can never express." She raised her eyes, swimming in tears of grateful emotion, to Flan. ders, as she spoke. He pressed her hand closer in his; then bent his eyes to the floor. They walked    -across the room  several times in silence. " Gratitude sounds coldly, Maria, when I hear it from your lips," resumed Flanders, musingly.  " I ask nothing on the ground of what you consider favors. I found a sweet reward in the act of conferring them. But if you--if, by-and-by, you can find a warmer, tenderer sentiment for me than gratitude, you will make me the happiest man in the world." His tones were low and tremulous as the night-winds; and they thrilled Maria's frame, so that she could scarcely stand, even with the support his arm afforded.  This Flanders perceived, but he dared not interpret it favorably.. Be it known, that he had been considerably indisposed, phys- ically, for several days; and on this evening his disease had communi- cated itself to the spiritual man. Under other circumstances, he would have counted on his high favor with Maria-his talents, wealth, and con. sciousness of worth; offered himself with a certainty of acceptance, and thrown down his glove to the whole world. 7     <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6890-00000050"/> 102      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN "Pardon me, dear Maria, for distressing you," he said, in a low, des. pending tone; " you will be my friend,-and--" "Yes; your friend, anything else you wish, dear William; and all thr your own sake, not gratitude's, too," said the ingenuous, blushing girl. Then Flanders's rapture was as excessive as his despondency had been. He caught her to his bosom, and imprinted a passionate kiss upon her lips. ' My wife, will you be?-my own sweet wife?" Maria could not resist laughing at the intense earnestness and delight of his manner. "Yes, William, anything-yes, your wife." Again he caught her in his arms. "And no being on earth will be so happy!-you are so good, so beau- tiful!-and you are to be all my own!" There is no computing how many extravagant things he would have said and done; but Maria laughed outright, and Howard came in upon them, just as he was about stopping her laugh with another kiss. "And so, Flanders-and so, sister-well; and so it seems 1 have lost one of the prettiest love-scenes in the world by this walk. Pray, sister, lid he propose, like the hero of his last tale; or did he do it by pan- tomimic gestures, like his Herbert?" Does the reader know that Flanders was an author? It was even so. Maria laughed, blushed, and looked up to Flanders.  "Ah, dear Maria, you must tell him, for I am sure I cannot. I must have done it in a a very foolish way; for Maria laughed most mischiev- ously at me." Howard became suddenly serious; kissed his sister, shook Flanders warmly by the hand, and then left the room. CHAPTER XIX. MRs. HAYES left Maria-or Fanny, as we shall hereafter call her-her sole heiress. On the day after her arrival at Franklin, accompanied by her mother-who was astonishingly recovered-and Flanders, she visited the cottage. To say that she regretted Mrs. Hayes, would not be true; yet she felt a sadness like that of the grave stealing over her, as she walked through the deserted rooms, and sat down to rest in the lonely little parlor. Howard did not accompany them, as was his intention when they left the house; but leaving them in the yard, he bent his course to the grove back of the colonel's buildings. It so happened that Jane, longing for complete solitude, where she might give free current to her reflections for one half hour, without danger of observation, left the house by a back way, and took the path leading   THE EASTERN STATES.            103 to the 'oods. She had not walked far before she heard the crash of dried limbs of trees, and, turning quickly round, shb saw Howard. Evidently he had not seen her. "Pert, forward-much too fond of himn for his peace," thought Jane, and she turned for a precipitate flight; but a sense of the impropriety of beating so rapid a retreat, in case Howard perceived her, induced more leisure. Wild-flowers were growing all along the path; and she set herself about gathering a bunch for a vase, as she proceeded homeward. But it was little she cared about them then; for her thoughts were upon Howard-upon the ungenerous construction he had put upon the famil- iarity 6and playfulness so natural to her, which grew so legitimately out of their situation, and which he had invited, nay, urged. She was not indignant; she felt none of the excitement, which erst was wont to mani- fest itself in tears or laughter; but, on the contrary, a calm sense of wrongs received: and it was this which infused a stateliness into her manner, and a coldness into her look'and tone, when .Howard joined her. which made his eye fall and the blood mount to his forehead. "Do n't let me disturb your solitude, Mr. Howard," said she. "I sup- posed you accompanied Mrs. Howard and her daughter." She quickened her step, for the purpose of leaving him: still he kept by her side, and still he was silent. To relieve the awkwardness of their situation, which she saw, by a glance at Howard's face, was more em- barrassing to him than to herself, she showed him a beautiful fringed gentian which she had just found. "There is something very pretty about this flower," said she. "I have forgotten the author's name, and where I found it. The little I recollect is the lesson of the flower in late autumn: So, child of earth, when from thee go The beautiful and kind, Would'st wear like me a happy smile? Be cheerful and resigned? Then upward, upward lift thine eye, And look, like me, to Heaven.' Such to me, of late," continued she, " is the language of every flower that meets my eye. I may suffer here.-may lose friends, health-be cruelly wronged by those I honored and trusted; but He who so clothes the flowers of the field, 'will also take care of me." "Thank Heaven, my dear Miss Ambrose, for giving you this trust, before sufferings of the kind you mention, taught you its necessity in the struggles that are before you." As he spoke, he took Jane's hand, drew it through his arm, and retained it in his own. "No, Mr. Howard; I did not fin! it until I met injustice where I least expected, and was thus led to look for something ',without variableness or shadow of turning."' "  I have suspicions, Miss Ambrose; but I dare not seek to correct or confirm them, by asking your confidence: you have forbidden this." He paused, but Jane remained silent. "If I might hope that you.--"    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6890-00000051"/> 104      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN "Jennie!" shouted some one approaching: it was old farmer Taylor. "Jennie, I suppose you will never forgive me for this intrusion," said he, shaking her and Howard warmly by the hand; " but your mother told me I should find you out here alone, after flowers, she supposed." "Oh! no apologies, if you please, Mr. Taylor: you can never intrude," said Jane; and she said it in all sincerity, for the interruption was a relief to her now agitated feelings. "How is Mrs. Taylor?" "Well, this is just what I came to tell you about. If you don't come to the help, Jennie, I don't know what I shall do. Dr. Hammond has 'given up the ship.'" "Is she really worse, then?" ' Why, only in the nervous part. You know she seldom has the hor- rors; and when she does, they rage terribly, and seem a real disease, which she has no power over. I tell her, I never feel so recpnciled to my frequent ups and downs, as I do when she has one of her tough spells upon her. She thinks this morning that she is going to live but a little longer, and that it is no matter if she don't: nobody cares anything about her-not even Jennie Ambrose." "Oh, I am sorry!" exclaimed Jane, in real concern for Mrs. Taylor and her faithful "old man," as she called him., She saw that he was struggling sturdily to keep "the best side out." ("Well, my good Mr. Taylor," continued she, "I will go up and spend the rest of the day with her, if mamma and our visitors will excuse me." "Ah, bless you, Jennie!" exclaimed he, with grateful earnestness. "I knew you would; and it always takes you to cure her when she is so nervous. I came down with my chaise. I'm going into the store, and I'll take you along with me then, if you say so. I suppose you won't be jealous of such an old, decrepit, homely man as I be, if I do carry off your lady?" he added, turning to Howard with a smile. "Oh no, certainly not;-but, Jane, may I go up and bring you home to night?" "You may come up in welcome; we'll all-even little Jennie here- be glad enough to see you," answered Mr. Taylor, laughing, and peeping archly in Jane's blushing face. "But I don't think we can spare her till to-morrow; and I'll tell you why. I have engaged to meet my brother of Dumbarton at Concord, this afternoon; and I can't get back till very late-near midnight. Our girl had the promise of going as far as Boscaven, to her mother's, to stay till I came back, if Jennie could go up. So you had better wait until morning, Mr. Howard; or, to please yourself and Jennie, you can come up to-night and stay till morning. Will that do, Jennie?" But they had reached the door, add Fanny came out to meet them, much to Jane's relief; tor it precluded a necessity of reply to Mr. Tay- lor's raillery and Howard's proposal. Fanny, " by advice of council," had decided on selling the oottage and its appurtenances; and it had already been agreed that that day must be   THE EASTERN STATES.           105 spent in supervisions necessary to their disposal. So Jane obtained ready consent to her visit. "You won't find your son of much service to you to-day, madam," said Mr. Taylor to Mrs. Howard, as he gathered up his reins. Howard was heloing Jane into the chaise. "Indeed! why, sir?" asked Mrs. Howard, smiling already in anticipa. tion of his reply. "Why, here is the magnet that will be drawing his thoughts off from everything else all day; and mark me as not being 'one of the prophets,' if it do n't draw him before night." "I would like to believe you, sir," said Mrs: Howard, stepping forward to kiss Jane's glowing cheek. Jane bent her head to receive the affectionate salutation. Her eyes filled-she hastily threw her veil over her face-bowed to them all-and Mr. Taylor turned his horse from the door. Jane found her own sadness gradually fleeing before her efforts to arouse Mrs. Taylor; and at night she felt happier than she had before for many months. Her power over Mrs. Taylor seemed almost magical. For several days she had kept her room, and felt a loathing of food of every kind. Jane prepared her dinner. "'T is certainly no better than we have atuevery meal; but hands that I love prepared it for me, and you can never know how good it tastes," said. Mrs. Taylor, with a smile, extending her plate for further supplies. After a hearty dinner, Jane read to her awhile, and then took her to the garden, to assist her in training plants that had been neglected during her illness; at night the old lady seemed to have entirely shaken off her depression. Mr. Taylor met his brother at Boscaven; hence, he was enabled to reach home before sunset. The maid returned with him; and he was likewise accompanied by hls niece, a lively creature of fifteen, whom her father had brought to Boscaven, for the, purpose of sending her on to. spend some time with the Taylors. "You must know, aunt, that father's farm was overstocked by both bipeds and quadrupeds. So he thought he would send off some of the wildest and most useless of each kind; and these happened to be my own self-a harum-scarum eolt-and three or four 'yellins'-it tickles me to death to hear old Aunt Tib call them. And-oh! there is a kitten!- I am just as glad as I can be. Kit! you and I shall have some good times. And, aunt, you must know-for they told me to tell you about it as soon as I got here-that they made out a set of laws as strict as those of old Lycurgus. You ain't to let me tear the house down over your heads-or pull the hills out there, up by the roots-or cut up any queer capers witth the Pennigewasset-or--ha, ha!-the funniest thing that they got up among them was, that I should go barefooted, as this would answer two good purposes-save ten, pairs of shoes per month-and, be- sides, uncle-ha, ha!-I guess you'll be tickled-besides, uncle, you    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6890-00000052"/> 106      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN would find toe-nails enough to repair all your stone-walls. And mother said-and a puppy, too, if I live! How is it that your kitten and puppy always stay a kitten and puppy? You are laughing at me; but, if I live! you have had a puppy and kitten every time I have been here since I have remembered; and I shall ransack every nook about here for a fountain of youth." Jane decided on returning home that night; and as no Howard had yet arrived, Mr. Taylor sent his man out to harness another horse. Mr. Taylor accompanied him, and reentered the sitting-room in a moment, accompanied by Baldwin, who was going immediately to the village, and requested the honor of conveying Jane. She would much rather have been attended by Mr. Taylor, but she could not say so without absolute rudeness; and hence took a place at his side. He began telling her about a friend of theirs whom he had just visited in Hill, and who was not expected to survive the night. Jane was so absorbed in his communi- cations that she did not observe the approach of a carriage, until she was startled by a self-complaisant "Good evening-how d'ye do, Mr. How- ard?" from Baldwin. She hastily turned her head, and saw Howard ap- proaching them in a buggy. He bowed coldly. Jane blushed-she hardly knew why-in shame at being seen with Baldwin, and in disap- pointment. She could not dbny to herself that he had superseded How- ard. It was by a powerful mental effort that she 'regained her usual self-possession, and compelled herself to lend an ear polite to Mr. Bald- win; and she had seldom felt such a sense of relief from something trou- blesome, as when she sprung from his carriage at their own door. She gave him a hasty "Thank you-good evening," and ran into the house to avoid being followed by him. ' I am sorry you calne with him," said Fanny. "Frank wished to go early to bring you," said Mrs. Howard; "but Mr. Luton called, relative to the purchase of Fanny's place; and his visit was prolonged to a tedious length. I think Frank looked at his watch twenty times while he sat here, and as often walked to the window' and looked out in the direction of Mr. Taylor's. Here he comes." lie did not enter immediately, and Jane left the room to remove her bonnet and shawl. When she returned, Mrs. Howard was reading a let- ter Frederic had just brought from the office. Howard entered the room by another door at the same time. A letter from Miss Wise, Frank," said Mrs. Howard. "She is in high. spirits it seems-is about to accompany her father in a tour to Eu- rope. She says," continued she, after reading further-" she says, ' rive my love to dear Frank. Tell him I cling to his promise, like a dlvingI man to a straw.'" Mrs. Howard fixed her eyes searchingly on her son's face, as she con- cluded. He looked at Jane, colored slightly, and then walked to a window. At that moment Jane reqvived a call from Frederic, for advice about the arrangement of some trees just received by stage. After a   1THE EASTERN STATES.           107 tew moments consultation, it was-decided that Henry must be appealed to, in order to determine the locality of some trees he had ordered, and with whose habits he alone was acquainted. Jane inquired for him in the sitting-room.  "He is in the parlor, I think: I just saw him enter," answered Mrs. Ambrose. He was standing at a window, with his back toward the door when Jane entered, and so abstracted, that he did not observe her entrance. She sprung lightly across the carpet, jumped upon a cricket behind him, flung both arms round his neck, and kissed his cheek. "Now confess, Harry, where were you?" she began; but she inter- rupted herself with a slight shriek, covered her face with her hands, and sunk upon the sofa. It was Howard instead of Henry. "Oh! what will he think of me now?-pert, forward," thought Jane. She heard him approaching her, and ran immediately from the room. She had no time for more mortifying reflections, for she met Henry and Frederic at the door; and, throwing on her bonnet, she accompanied them to the yard, where the colonel and John were already at work. Fanny soon joined them, with her, brother. "Frederic, Caroline and William, have been vibrating these two hours, upon an abstruse chemical question, and yet 'still remain in .tatu quo.' Caroline says you saw some experiments which will help you to set the matter at rest. Please go; and Henry, please revenge me upon William for his disloyalty to me in this instance, by being my knight in a ramble- it is so pleasant!" . She took Henry's arm, after' He had offered a few more suggestions to John. "As mistress of ceremonies, Jennie and Frank, I commend you to each other," resumed she, nodding at Jane with an air of arch triumph. "Will you oblige us in this, Miss Ambrose?" said Howard, offering his arm. Jane bowed, took his arm, and started off rapidly, in the purpose of overtaking Fanny and 'Henry. But they walked on with a degree of rapidity which precluded the possibility of the thing, Fanny turned half round several times, waved her handkerchief, and again hurried forward. Howard and Jane both laughed heartily, gave up the pursuit, and walked on in a loitering step, suited to an evening of such stillness and beauty. Jane lost sight of all unpleasant recollections, gave herself up to the in- fluences of the scene, and-was happy. Howard, too, was unusually animated. He had thrown off the sadness and reserve, which had marked his manner since his arrival; and. was, as in the early days ot their in- tercourse, cheerful, tender, and enthusiastic. They paused frequently- now to look at the river, where it leaped and sparkled in the moonlight, then at the shrubbery and trees along the banks, in whose dark recesses a thousand fireflies were gamboling; and again they seemed almost to forget to move, so occupied were they in listening to each other's tones. forge to mve, s IL;UILU FS LI 1 ru-;p    <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6890-00000053"/> 108     JENNY AIMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN "Oh, how delightful are all of natuie's influences!" exclaimed Jane. With a soft sigh of pleasure, and a look of sweet earnestness, she turned to Howard. He pressed her hand closer in his. "Yes, dear Jane, but dearer to me than anything else in the world, would be the constant companionship and sympathy of a beloved being, whose thoughts would be as my thoughts." Jane would have found his emotion contagious, but that she thought of Miss Wise, nothing doubting that she was the "beloved being"Howard ilad in his thoughts at that moment. "Yes; I presume that would be pleasant for you," answered she care- sslvy. Howard looked inquiringly in her face. "I judged from what I have cnjinved since I came to Franklin-from what I enjoy now, Miss Am- brose." Jane seemed determined not to understand him. "Yes; 't is pleasant here; and this is one of the prettiest evenings I have ever known. I have found enough pleasure, nearly to counterbalance the mortifying circumstances that have beset me on all sides to-day." "M1ortifying circumstances, Miss Ambrose?" "Yes; for instance, intruding myself upon your solitude this morning." ' Intruding yourself, Jane!" said Howard, half reproachfully. "Yes; and then running away from you with Baldwin; or, upon a second thought, that did but offset the morning's intrusion. And then-" she blushed and hesitated as she continued-" and then, as if that were not enough to constitute my 'day of misfortunes,' my evil genius set me upon you in that awful mistake. You understood it all, surely; you did not think it further proof that I am pert, forward, and so on, Mr. Hloward, as you- "She paused. Howard seemed not to comprehend the meaning of her last words. ' You mistook me for your brother," said he, smiling, and peeping under Jane's bonnet with an archness that made her blush and avert her thee. They heard merry tones behind them, and turning, they saw Flanders and Caroline-near them. Others were behind them; and they distinguished the voices of Sidney, Frederic, Miss Herbert, and Jeanette Eastman. Flanders demanded Fanny at Howard's hands.  "Yes," ,aid Caroline, "ever since she left the room, he has been like one distraught. He has said carbonic acid when he meant caloric, as I inferred from the connection, and Fanny, when he meant voltaic battery." "Well, Carl, you need n't say a word," said Jeanette. "I have some most pretty things' to say about you. I never saw you do such a roguish thing before Caroline. Would you have believed it of her, Mr. Howard, she is such a paragon of propriety, as Fanny Pons says? Just as she and Mr. Flanders were coming out of the yard, Sidney, Sara and ! hailed them, on our way to the colonel's. What did Carl do, but jump, just like a frolicsome kitten, and then run, taking Mr. Flanders along with her. ' Tell it not.' And see, Carl! this is what I shall call   THE EASTERN STATES.            109 the catastrophe." She held up the bottom of her dress, which was badly torn. "There! here was but a little crevice, no more than, so long," measuring by her arm, "caused by climbing into one of our back win. dows, when a sheep I had provoked was after me. Well, Sidney too was distraught, it seems, for he performed sundry droll pedal gesticula- tions, by way of overtaking you; and at last he thrust his boot through the hole in my dress, and you see 'tis a hole no longer. Here come Miss Howard and Henry. Sara! Jane! help me just to break up this order of travel. There is nothing in this world annoys me so much as system; and if Mr. Lane happens to be at all methodical, I shall put him in the plight of Hogarth's ' Enraged Musician,' outright." She threw herself upon the arms of Fanny and Henry, and separating them, sent Fanny on, while she took Henry's arm; but seeing Flanders approach Fanny, she sprang forward to intercept him. She stepped on her torn dress, but had only a moment to clap her hands and laugh at the fiagment she had left lying in the road, before bounding forward to take the arm Flanders was presenting to Fanny. Then she looked round upon the group and laughed. "There! just such a snarl as I like to see things in. Mother says that when she comes to visit me, she shall find just such a little clearing in the centre of my 'diggins ;' and that all around the edges will be stowed away, in 'confusion worse confounded,' ladles, shovels, rugs, pails, and so on, to the end, of the list of a housekeeper's paraphernalia. She says, I shall be as likely to hang Mr. Lane's collars and bosoms on the top of a brass kettle to dry, as any way." '"Pray, what does this mean, Jeanette? Surely you are not going to marry that old bachelor!"' said Jane. "Why, yes I am, my dear; and 't is for the purpose of inviting you all, en masse, collectively, tout ensemble, 4.c., et cetera, et id allis, as Bald- win would say-ha! how did I begin, Jennie? I've forgotten, and can't, for the life of me, tell how to finish ;-and this comes of sprinkling paren- theses into the middle of my sentences, against the express laws of Dr. Blair. Well, will you all come to my wedding, next Monday evening, at eight o'clock?" She concluded, with unusual seriousness and dignlty. "You cannot be serious in this, Jeanette-you are not to marry that old gentleman-at least, not so soon," said Caroline. "But I am. Have n't I always said I would marry a man old enough to be my grandfather, or no one? 'T will, be so delightful to be 'an old man's darling!' He is noble, rich, and good. He loves me; and I find I am beginning to love hi m." "But, how have you been so secret?" "So Sara asked me.

The thoughtless girl was so convulsed with laughter, that she could scarcely return their parting salutation, as the party separated at the entrance of the avenue. CHAPTER XX. THERE was joy at Franklin; and especially in the household of our friends, the Ambroses; for Henry, accompanied by Sidney and Caroline, had gone to Boston, to bring Miss Graham, as his bride, to Franklin. "I certainly never was so delighted!" exclaimed Mrs. Pons, as she 'just dropped in " at Mr. Eastman's. ( At what, Mrs. Pons?" inquired Mrs. Eastman, moving a chair toward Mrs. Pons, without rising. "Why, Henry has gone to bring Miss Graham to town, as Mrs. Henry Ambrose; you know that, of course. Well, and Mr. Flanders received a letter from his family, dated at Montpelier. They are to visit their friends at Meredith, and spend a short time at the lake, where Mrs. How- ard and her daughter, who have never been there, and Mr. Flanders, have gone to meet them. Mr. Howard preferred staying with his Jane, it seems. Ah! we shall see who is right about that affair, very soon, Mrs. Eastman. 'Twill be the most charming match that ever came off in this town. And Mr. Flanders and the dear Miss Howard-nothing could be pleasanter! What great things sometimes come from the least beginnings, Mrs. Eastman!" Well-they do-but I don't know that I ever thought of it before." "Oh! I have, many times. I have just come from the colonel's. T is s'-ange! they are very happy, no doubt; but as calm as if nothing uncomn on was going on. Mrs. Ambrose goes round the house singing, in her quiet way; she and Alice, and widow Lawton, who is helping them, are filling their capacious pantry with cakes of different kinds, pies, tarts, bread, blanc-mange, custards, and every such thing one could think of, while the colonel, and Mr. Howard-now that the finishing stroke is put to Henry's beautiful house-are, under Jane's skillful superintend- ence, giving a touch of magic to the whole house." ( Well-Abby Gass was in here this afternoon; she said they were turning the house upside down; but one never knows what to make of her stories." "No: Abby is a very good girl-in her way, and I would n't say anything against her for the world; but I do wish she loved her neigh- bors better, 't is so delightful! They have n't torn up carpets, scarcely   THE EASTERN STATES.-           " the worse for wear; or sent off sofas, side-boards,- book-cases, chairs, tables, mirrors, crockery, and so on-as I knew some families in my brother's circle to do, while I was in Philadelphia-to make way for carpets, sofas, chairs, &amp;c., more costly in material, more modern and splendid in style. But, as I have known them to do before-as I have done myself-they have made changes that give to everything an appear- ance equally new and charming. They have moved all of their plants- and I never saw such a full and beautiful variety-into the long-entry, together with maps, and pictures in abundance, and the bird-cages, and, altogether, it has decidedly the charming look of a very paradise,. But 1 declare I must go. They are expecting their friends from Boston, and from the lake, too, to-morrow evening. How delightful it will be! I shall long to be in the middle of it; but-then I suppose the house will be pretty well filled with their visitors-or, there! Mrs. Eastman! they'll a part of them lodge at Henry's-that is just what they 'll do; I wonder it did n't occur to me before. They say Mr. Graham has fur- nished it in a splendid way, from top to bottom. We can't see from our house; and, besides, 'twas nearly dark when the things came into the village. Mrs. Eastman, you must call ;-or they say-or from what they say, I infer that Miss Graham's brother and sister are coming up with them to stop awhile. How pleasant it will be!-and, Mrs. Eastman, here will be two more delightful matches for somebody. Quite likely Frederic will come in for the lady; and for the gentleman-really I can't think who it will be likely to be. Nous verrons, as Fanny says. But good afternoon, Mrs. Eastman." The reader knows enough of Mrs. Pons, to rely on all that she .ffirmed, and all that she conjectured; and so our tale of proceedings at the colo- nel's is almost told. The misses of the "Juvenile Howard Association " met on that after- noon, at Mrs. Herbert's. "I've got a card, that Aunt Clara drew me for the dear, sweet Miss Graham, when she gets to Franklin-Mrs. Henry Ambrose," said little Clara Lawrence, as she drew herself farther and farther yet back in her chair; she was so short her feet could not reach the floor. "Oh! I am just as glad about her coming," said Susan Eastman. "Ha! I love to hear Mrs Pons talk about it, and see Fan look old-maidish." ' Fanny Pons do n't look old-maidish, Miss Susan," said Clara; and she tossed her curls, and dropped more than a dozen stitches as she said it. "Aunt Clara says she is an old maid, herself; and she is no more like Fanny Pons than you or I am. She's as pretty as anybody; she sings and laughs as neat as my Canaries, and she is as good and sweet- tempered as molasses-candy-now." Susan laughed; and finally, when Clara had caught all of her stitches fairly, she .laughed too. ( You would all have laughed well, if you had been at our house this morning when the stage come, I tell you now," said Susan. "We had    <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6890-00000055"/> "2      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN a box from Jeanette. We all expected something nice; and one guessed one thing, and another, another thing, while papa was unravelling paper after paper; and at last, he found written on one, 'A specimen of my cooking,' or something of that sort; and when he emptied that paper- ha, ha!-I shall laugh as long as I live, when I think of it, I know I shall-out tumbled two biscuits, solid as lead, and burnt to a cinder, al- most. One was for Emeline, and the other for Jennie. I went into the colonel's to carry her's; and they are making their house look like a palace, I tell you." Yes, all because those Boston folks are coming up," said Pheby Gass. "For my part, I do n't think they are any better than common folks; and mother and Abby say they do n't." "I guess they ain't doing it because those Boston folks are coming up, neither, madam," said Clara. "I have known them to do so a thousand time,; and our folks do just so; and they say it's about as well as having new furniture, and all, it makes everythitng look so new, clean, and nice." Oh, yes! do n't you all remember how we did a year ago, when we met there?" asked Susan. ' Oh, yes!" and "So do I, too!" passed through the animated group. "I shall remember it as long as I live, the room looked so beautiful! and it seemed so cool, and everything in the room was shaded so by the green festoons and flowers! I can 't remember all about it now, 't is so long, you know ; and 1 feel just as if it was all a picture, or a dream, or it seems just as beautiful as I think heaven must be, from what folks say about it." "Yes-yes-that is what I told mamma," answered the modest little Emma Gates, blushing and stammering in her childish timidity and ear- nestness." "Well-I 'll tell you what let's do," said Susan: "let's hurry as tight as we can, get our stints done, and then take Joe, and Lewis, and George, and go to the woods and wreathe a lot of evergreens and oak- leaves, and get lots and lots of wild-flowers, just as we did then." There was not one dissenting voice, except from Pheby Gass. Her's was overruled; and most dexterously did they ply their nimble fingers at their tasks. These completed, they ran to the woods; and in an hour or two, repaired to Jane with their beautiful offerings; and with glistening eyes and happy hearts, they watched their arrangements, by Howard and Jane, into festoons around the walls, windows, paintings, statues and busts, of the dining-hall. Poor Pheby alone, seemed not to partake the general ,jayety. Her mother, and her sister Abby, were exceedingly ill-tem. pe red; and, what is much worse than passionate ebullitions of temper- because more deliberately indulged-they were cross and malicious. Of course, Pheby (rank often of the bitter waters of contention and sarcasm; and, of course, there accumulated, at last, a fountain of bitter waters in her young heart. This was the more to be regretted; for, in early child- hood, she had been a happy, frolicsome creature, beautiful as a cherub.   THE EASTERN STATES.            113 There she stood, with her arms folded on her breast, her head- thrown back, her brow disfigured by a frown, and her lips by an ill-natured com- pression. The freckled, ill-featured, deformed Emma Gates-with all her natural imperfections--was yet beautiful in comparison; for pleas- ant thoughts nestled "in the blue heaven of her eye." Intellectual strength and activity lit up all her features, and made them lovely. Ar- dent affections infused themselves into all her actions, and made them graceful. So thought Jane, as she put back her braids from her face and kissed her. "Well, come girls; I sha'n't stay any longer, for mother will scold my head off," said Pheby, starting toward the door. The rest all went to Jane for a kiss, and then followed her. CHAPTER XXI. A BEAUTIFUL twilight came on; and although fatigued by the labors of the day, Howard and Jane could not deny themselves their accustomed walk. The colonel and his wife excused themselves on account of their fatigue; Frederic plead an engagement, and Howard and Jane went out alone. "We have been so happy-at least I have-these two days we have spent alone, that I half dread to morrow's accession, although it brings a mother and sister," said Mr. Howard. "You avoid me so sedulously, Jane! you are so cold and repelling, if, after hours, perhaps days of lone- liness, I find a place at your side! I have no right to complain; but most earnestly do I long for more of your confidence and favor; and I would not shrink from any efforts that might gain for me a place in your esteem. What can I do, dearest Jane?" "Refute reports I have had of certain scandalous insinuations against tme; or explain to me, satisfactorily, why you made them-and-" she paused, too much agitated to speak. "Scandalous insinuations-please explain yourself." "I will, for I hate this concealment-it has been pressing down upon my heart like an incubus, months. Do you remember all that. happened between us at Mrs. Pons's?" "I do-your emotion there; and I have always felt, that that had something to do with our subsequent painful estrangement. [ have been on the point, a hundred times, of again asking ap explanation; but was deterred by your commands to the contrary. Now tell me all about it." "Well: I took a window-seat alone, where I was concealed by the hangings; and while there I overheard a conversation, the amount of which was, that you had been heard to say that ' I was pert-forward-.-    <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6890-00000056"/> "4      JENNY AMBROSE; OR, LIFE IN much too fond of you, for your perfect enjoyment at our house-that you vastly preferred Caroline,' &amp;c. 'Tis a humiliating confession-but it was this that disturbed me so much that evening; 't is this that has made my conduct such an inconsistent piece ever since." "And did you believe me capable of such meanness?-could you, Jane." "At times, when in conversation with you alone, your mahner was so kind, that I forgot or disbelieved it all; and then I was very happy again. But I knew, when I thought of my manner toward you, that it had been very familiar, and confidential. I had never treated you as perhaps a lady should treat a stranger. So I reasoned; and again had no doubts about the truth of those reports. Sometimes I was vexed, sometimes grieved, as you saw-and sometimes I sought a Lethean draught in a whirlpool of gayety. Now, Howard, I have confessed all but this-if you did say those things, I think you wronged me; still, I have forgiven you, in spite of myself. 'If you did not, I am very sorry that the har- mony of' our intercourse met such a harsh and permanent jar. I think more of this now, that we are so soon to part-perhaps for ever." "So far was I from censuring your deportment, Jane, it was for this sweet confidence, this childlike and beautiful simplicity, that I loved you from the first hour of our intimacy. The coldness and evident dislike which followed, gave me more pain than I have the power of telling. This does not explain anything, but I trust it satisfies you." "Oh, yes! and can you forgive me for ever doubting such goodness as yours?  "I have nothing to forgive, dear Jane. Would that this explanation had come earlier." He paused, and thoughts of Miss Wise rushed upon Jane with heart. sickening influences. "There have been months of alienation," resumed Howard, "and now, as you say, we are about to part, and perhaps, for ever!" * His voice was almost inaudible from emotion; and Jane felt his hand, which held hers, tremble. "Jane, I shall have no concealments on my part. You are dearer to mne a thousand times than any earthly being; and to make you mine by the tenderest, sweetest of ties, is the most earnest wish of my heart, May I hope, dearest Jane, that you can love me? and-" Jane's emotion interrupted him. She became pale and faint, and so oppressed, that she could scarcely breathe; and dropping Howard's arm, she sunk, nearly fainting, on the bank of the river-path where they were walking. Howard hastily threw off her bonnet. The cool air in her face revived her, and she burst into tears. Howard pressed her closer and closer to his heart. He wiped her tears from her face, and she per- nitted him to seal their contract by one fervid kiss upon her lips. Hours they sat there, heedless alike of time, the beauties of the even- ing, and everything but the presence of all they loved best on earth.   THE EASTERN' STATES.           115 Many times they asked themselves and each other, if their nappiness was indeed real; for it followed so unexpectedly upon the greatest despond- ency, as to seem like a dream to them. But to give to their cup the mixed nature of all earthly draughts, there came thoughts of the approaching parting. It had been settled tha the  Howards should accompany the Flanders on their return home. "You must write to me every week, twice evory week, dear Howard, while you are gone, or I shall torment myself with fears that you are sick--or allowing that Miss Wise to rival me." They both laughed. "Ah, now I recollect!" said Howard. "She sent me a message about my promise to her. I was embarrassed-and you-you ran from the room. And so, you were jealous? but seriously, love, did you think the promise she alluded to, one of marriage?"  "Yes; from your confusion, and from certain insinuations to that amount, which your mother had from Miss Wise's family. Now confess." "Yes-that she, only, was acquainted with my love for you, and your dislike for me." "Yes, Howard; dislike was the right word," said Jane, still laughing. ' And so--" "And so she suspected unfair play, somewhere; and insisted on my promise to seek an explanation, before my return to Virginia. Hence her message."  It was late when they reached home, and all the family had retired,. except Mr. and Mrs. Ambrose. They could not conceal their happiness. Howard asked, and obtained permission, to make Jane his "ain wee wife."' The joy of the parents at the happiness of their child, was chast- ened by the idea of losing her society. "And so it must always be with our pleasures here," said the colonel. "And it is well; for we should never look to heaven as the better land, if we might find perfect happiness on earth."  "Nor taste the Christian's sweetest privilege, Mr. Ambrose; a hum- ble, child-like trust in our heavenly Father, as a refuge in time of trouble. We are too apt to lose sight of this when in perfect prosperity." We do not know what trials may come upon our friends, to perpet- uate this feelingof dependence on Heaven; but to part with their beloved Jane, is hot of the number. On the following morning, the Flanders and Howards, left Franklin for Connecticut and Virginia, with the plan of selling their estates there, and removing to Franklin. Arrangements to this effect had already, in the last three days, been made there. The Howards had withdrawn their proposals for the sale of the cottage, and contracted with the Messrs. Hunt &amp; Ladd, for the erection of a new and beautiful house, after the model of the English cottages, on the site of the old house. This was to be completed in two months, the period allotted for their ab. sence; and was to be occupied by Flanders and Fanny. Esquire Her.    <pb n="116" xml:id="VAC6890-00000057"/> "6          JENNY ABROSE. vey, just over the way, had long been seeking a purchaser to his large, valuable, and beautiful farm; which lay stretched out on the Merrimac, below the village. The buildings were elegant; and so capacious and numerous, and the farm was so large, withal, that it was purchased for the joint occupancy of Howard and Sidney. And the suit of rooms, which Frank and Jane thought just the pleasantest in their house, were to be fitted up purposely for Mrs. Howard. And-"How fortunate for Esquire Flanders!" said all Franklin, except Mrs. Sprague; and- i "What a wise and wonrderful dispensation of Providence!" said she; for just at that time, Mr. Norris, not "the last man," but the last intempe- rate man in the village, found himself compelled, by a brief but, reck- less course of " riotous living," to dispose of the elegant situation left him by his fiugal and hard-working father. "Wonderful dispensation of Providence," forsooth! it needed no more curiosity, than little Susan Eastman possessed, to see that it was the natural consequence of folly, "Anybody would come off so, who did just nothing at all but drink rum, and help Zeke, like Mr. Norris ;" so said Susan, as Mrs. Sprague left Mr. Eastman's on her round in the distribution of her sage reflections upon the subject. Tl is situation was purchased by the elder Flanders. On the sabbath subsequent to the return of the Howards and Flanders to Franklin, Fanny, Caroline and Jane, gave themselves up to the chosen of their hearts, at the altar of the village ohurch. When Mrs. Howard took the happy, but weeping Jane to her arms, as they entered their own home, she felt that there was nothing more for her to ask; and hurrying to her chamber, she poured out the gratitude of an overcharged heart, in thanksgivin, to Heaven. Mrs. Ambrose's emotion was as deep, but more subdued. It betrayed itself only to the close observer, in an occasional filling of her mild eye, a quivering of her lip, a trembling of her voice as she spoke, or when she went about the lIml:e singing in her quiet way. But it rose from her heart, at every breath-a grateful incense to Him, who in blessing, had never ceased to bless her; and in pleading that so many rich gifts might not wean her from the Giver. Howard and his wife sat hours with their hands fondly clasped, seldom speaking-so quiet is perfect contentment-except when rallied by the ever lively Ellenora, or her equally gay and lovely sister. "And the dear Fanny and Caroline, (for so I still love to call them) are as happy as mortals can be," said Mrs. Pons. "And Mrs. Howard, and Esquire Flanders and his lady-both so eccentric, and yet so de- lightful-and their sweet daughters-I declare I think our village is be- coining the most delightful in the world! And then, if Daniel Webster * woulid only come home and stay, now there is such a fuss in the Cabinet!" THE END.       </p>
