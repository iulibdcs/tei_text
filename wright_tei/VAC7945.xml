               <head type="sub">THE OLD TOWN.</head>
               <p>THE setting sunbeams slant over the antique gateway of Sorrento, fusing into a
                  golden bronze the brown freestone vestments of old Saint Antonio, who with his
                  heavy stone mitre and upraised hands has for centuries kept watch thereupon.</p>
               <p>A quiet time he has of it up there in the golden Italian air, in petrified act of
                  blessing, while orange lichens and green mosses from year to year embroider quaint
                  patterns on the seams of his sacerdotal vestments, and small tassels of grass
                  volunteer to ornament the folds of his priestly drapery, and golden showers of
                  blossoms from some more hardy plant fall from his ample sleeve-cuffs. Little birds
                  perch and chitter and wipe their beaks unconcernedly, now on the tip of his nose
                  and now on the point of his mitre, while the world below goes on its way pretty
                  much as it did when the good saint was alive, and, in despair of the human
                  brotherhood, took to preaching to the birds and the fishes.</p>
               <p>Whoever passed beneath this old arched gateway, thus saint-guarded, in the year of
                  our Lord's grace——, might have seen under its shadow, sitting opposite to a stand
                  of golden oranges, the little Agnes.</p>
               <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7945-00000005"/>
               <p>A very pretty picture was she, reader,—with such a face as you sometimes see
                  painted in those wayside shrines of sunny Italy, where the lamp burns pale at
                  evening, and gillyflower and cyclamen are renewed with every morning.</p>
               <p>She might have been fifteen or thereabouts, but was so small of stature that she
                  seemed yet a child. Her black hair was parted in a white unbroken seam down to the
                  high forehead, whose serious arch, like that of a cathedral-door, spoke of thought
                  and prayer. Beneath the shadows of this brow lay brown, translucent eyes, into
                  whose thoughtful depths one might look as pilgrims gaze into the waters of some
                  saintly well, cool and pure down to the unblemished sand at the bottom. The small
                  lips had a gentle compression, which indicated a repressed strength of feeling;
                  while the straight line of the nose, and the flexible, delicate nostril, were
                  perfect as in those sculptured fragments of the antique which the soil of Italy so
                  often gives forth to the day from the sepulchres of the past. The habitual pose of
                  the head and face had the shy uplooking grace of a violet; and yet there was a
                  grave tranquillity of expression, which gave a peculiar degree of character to the
                  whole figure.</p>
               <p>At the moment at which we have called your attention, the fair head is bent, the
                  long eyelashes lie softly down on the pale, smooth cheek; for the Ave Maria bell
                  is sounding from the Cathedral of Sorrento, and the child is busy with her
                  beads.</p>
               <p>By her side sits a woman of some threescore years, tall, stately, and squarely
                  formed, with ample breadth of back and size of chest, like the robust dames of
                  Sorrento. Her strong Roman nose, the firm, determined outline of her mouth, and a
                  certain energy in every motion, speak the woman of will and purpose. There is a
                  degree of vigor in the decision with which she lays down her spindle and bows her
                  head, as a good Christian of those days would, at the swinging of the evening
                  bell.</p>
               <p>But while the soul of the child in its morning freshness, free from pressure or
                  conscience of earthly care, rose like an illuminated mist to heaven, the words the
                  white-haired woman repeated were twined with threads of worldly prudence,—thoughts
                  of how many oranges she had sold, with a rough guess at the probable amount for
                  the day,—and her fingers wandered from her beads a moment to see if the last coin
                  had been swept from the stand into her capacious pocket, and her eyes wandering
                  after them suddenly made her aware of the fact that a handsome cavalier was
                  standing in the gate, regarding her pretty grandchild with looks of undisguised
                  admiration.</p>
               <p>"Let him look!" she said to herself, with a grim clasp on her rosary;—"a fair face
                  draws buyers, and our oranges must be turned into money; but he who does more than
                  look has an affair with me;—so gaze away, my master, and take it out in buying
                     oranges!—<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Ave Maria! ora pro nobis, nunc et</foreign>,"
                  etc., etc.</p>
               <p>A few moments, and the wave of prayer which had flowed down the quaint old shadowy
                  street, bowing all heads as the wind bowed the scarlet tassels of neighboring
                  clover-fields, was passed, and all the world resumed the work of earth just where
                  they left off when the bell began.</p>
               <p>"Good even to you, pretty maiden!" said the cavalier, approaching the stall of the
                  orange-woman with the easy, confident air of one secure of a ready welcome, and
                  bending down on the yet prayerful maiden the glances of a pair of piercing hazel
                  eyes that looked out on each side of his aquiline nose with the keenness of a
                  falcon's.</p>
               <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7945-00000006"/>
               <p>"Good even to you, pretty one! We shall take you for a saint, and worship you in
                  right earnest, if you raise not those eyelashes soon."</p>
               <p>"Sir! my lord!" said the girl,—a bright color flushing into her smooth brown
                  cheeks, and her large dreamy eyes suddenly upraised with a flutter, as of a bird
                  about to take flight.</p>
               <p>"Agnes, bethink yourself!" said the white-haired dame;—"the gentleman asks the
                  price of your oranges;—be alive, child!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, my lord," said the young girl, "here are a dozen fine ones."</p>
               <p>"Well, you shall give them me, pretty one," said the young man, throwing a gold
                  piece down on the stand with a careless ring.</p>
               <p>"Here, Agnes, run to the stall of Raphael the poulterer for change," said the
                  adroit dame, picking up the gold.</p>
               <p>"Nay, good mother, by your leave," said the unabashed cavalier; "I make my change
                  with youth and beauty thus!" And with the word he stooped down and kissed the fair
                  forehead between the eyes.</p>
               <p>"For shame, Sir!" said the elderly woman, raising her distaff,—her great
                  glittering eyes flashing beneath her silver hair like tongues of lightning from a
                  white cloud. "Have a care!—this child is named for blessed Saint Agnes, and is
                  under her protection."</p>
               <p>"The saints must pray for us, when their beauty makes us forget ourselves," said
                  the young cavalier, with a smile. "Look me in the face, little one," he
                  added;—"say, wilt thou pray for me?"</p>
               <p>The maiden raised her large serious eyes, and surveyed the haughty, handsome face
                  with that look of sober inquiry quiry which one sometimes sees in young children,
                  and the blush slowly faded from her cheek, as a cloud fades after sunset.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lord," she answered, with a grave simplicity,—"I <emph>will</emph> pray
                  for you."</p>
               <p>"And hang this upon the shrine of Saint Agnes for my sake," he added, drawing from
                  his finger a diamond ring, which he dropped into her hand; and before mother or
                  daughter could add another word or recover from their surprise, he had thrown the
                  corner of his mantle over his shoulder and was off down the narrow street, humming
                  the refrain of a gay song.</p>
               <p>"You have struck a pretty dove with that bolt," said another cavalier, who
                  appeared to have been observing the proceeding, and now, stepping forward, joined
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Like enough," said the first, carelessly.</p>
               <p>"The old woman keeps her mewed up like a singing-bird," said the second; "and if a
                  fellow wants speech of her, it's as much as his crown is worth; for Dame Elsie has
                  a strong arm, and her distaff is known to be heavy."</p>
               <p>"Upon my word," said the first cavalier, stopping and throwing a glance
                  backward,—"where do they keep her?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, in a sort of pigeon's nest up above the Gorge; but one never sees her, except
                  under the fire of her grandmother's eyes. The little one is brought up for a
                  saint, they say, and goes nowhere but to mass, confession, and the sacrament."</p>
               <p>"Humph?" said the other, "she looks like some choice old picture of Our Lady,—not
                  a drop of human blood in her. When I kissed her forehead, she looked into my
                     face<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7945-00000007"/> as grave and innocent as a babe.
                  One is tempted to try what one can do in such a case."</p>
               <p>"Beware the grandmother's distaff!" said the other, laughing.</p>
               <p>"I've seen old women before," said the cavalier, as they turned down the street
                  and were lost to view.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the grandmother and grand-daughter were roused from the mute
                  astonishment in which they were gazing after the young cavalier by a tittering
                  behind them; and a pair of bright eyes looked out upon them from beneath a bundle
                  of long, crimson-headed clover, whose rich carmine tints were touched to brighter
                  life by setting sun-beams.</p>
               <p>There stood Giulietta, the head coquette of the Sorrento girls, with her broad
                  shoulders, full chest, and great black eyes, rich and heavy as those of the
                  silver-haired ox for whose benefit she had been cutting clover. Her bronzed cheek
                  was smooth as that of any statue, and showed a color like that of an open
                  pomegranate; and the opulent, lazy abundance of her ample form, with her leisurely
                  movements, spoke an easy and comfortable nature,—that is to say, when Giulietta
                  was pleased; for it is to be remarked that there lurked certain sparkles deep down
                  in her great eyes, which might, on occasion, blaze out into sheet-lightning, like
                  her own beautiful skies, which, lovely as they are, can thunder and sulk with
                  terrible earnestness when the fit takes them. At present, however, her face was
                  running over with mischievous merriment, as she slyly pinched little Agnes by the
                  ear.</p>
               <p>"So you know not you gay cavalier, little sister?" she said, looking askance at
                  her from under her long lashes.</p>
               <p>"No, indeed! What has an honest girl to do with knowing gay cavaliers?" said Dame
                  Elsie, bestirring herself with packing the remaining oranges into a basket, which
                  she covered trimly with a heavy linen towel of her own weaving. "Girls never come
                  to good who let their eyes go walking through the earth, and have the names of all
                  the wild gallants on their tongues. Agnes knows no such nonsense,—blessed be her
                  gracious patroness, with Our Lady and Saint Michael!"</p>
               <p>"I hope there is no harm in knowing what is right before one's eyes," said
                  Giulietta. "Anybody must be blind and deaf not to know the Lord Adrian. All the
                  girls in Sorrento know him. They say he is even greater than he appears,—that he
                  is brother to the King himself; at any rate, a handsomer and more gallant
                  gentleman never wore spurs."</p>
               <p>"Let him keep to his own kind," said Elsie. "Eagles make bad work in dove-cots. No
                  good comes of such gallants for us."</p>
               <p>"Nor any harm, that I ever heard of," said Giulietta. "But let me see, pretty
                  one,—what did he give you? Holy Mother! what a handsome ring!"</p>
               <p>"It is to hang on the shrine of Saint Agnes," said the younger girl, looking up
                  with simplicity.</p>
               <p>A loud laugh was the first answer to this communication. The scarlet clover-tops
                  shook and quivered with the merriment.</p>
               <p>"To hang on the shrine of Saint Agnes!" Giulietta repeated. "That is a little too
                  good!"</p>
               <p>"Go, go, you baggage!" said Elsie, wrathfully brandishing her spindle. "If ever
                  you get a husband, I hope he'll give you a good beating! You need it, I warrant!
                     Always<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7945-00000008"/> stopping on the bridge there,
                  to have cracks with the young men! Little enough you know of saints, I dare say!
                  So keep away from <emph>my</emph> child!—Come, Agnes," she said, as she lifted the
                  orange-basket on to her head; and, straightening her tall form, she seized the
                  girl by the hand to lead her away.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE DOVE-COT.</head>
               <p>THE old town of Sorrento is situated on an elevated plateau, which stretches into
                  the sunny waters of the Mediterranean, guarded on all sides by a barrier of
                  mountains which defend it from bleak winds and serve to it the purpose of walls to
                  a garden. Here, groves of oranges and lemons, with their almost fabulous
                  coincidence of fruitage with flowers, fill the air with perfume, which blends with
                  that of roses and jessamines; and the fields are so starred and enamelled with
                  flowers that they might have served as the type for those Elysian realms sung by
                  ancient poets. The fervid air is fanned by continual sea-breezes, which give a
                  delightful elasticity to the otherwise languid climate. Under all these cherishing
                  influences; the human being develops a wealth and luxuriance of physical beauty
                  unknown in less favored regions. In the region about Sorrento one may be said to
                  have found the land where beauty is the rule and not the exception. The
                  singularity there is not to see handsome points of physical proportion, but rather
                  to see those who are without them. Scarce a man, woman, or child you meet who has
                  not some personal advantage to be commended, while even striking beauty is common.
                  Also, under these kindly skies, a native courtesy and gentleness of manner make
                  themselves felt. It would seem as if humanity, rocked in this flowery cradle, and
                  soothed by so many daily caresses and appliances of nursing Nature, grew up with
                  all that is kindliest on the outward,—not repressed and beat in, as<pb n="16-17"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000009"/> under the inclement atmosphere and stormy skies of
                  the North.</p>
               <p>The town of Sorrento itself overhangs the sea, skirting along rocky shores, which,
                  hollowed here and there into picturesque grottoes, and fledged with a wild plumage
                  of brilliant flowers and trailing vines, descend in steep precipices to the water.
                  Along the shelly beach, at the bottom, one can wander to look out on the loveliest
                  prospect in the world. Vesuvius rises with its two peaks softly clouded in blue
                  and purple mists, which blend with its ascending vapors,—Naples and the adjoining
                  villages at its base gleaming in the distance like a fringe of pearls on a regal
                  mantle. Nearer by, the picturesque rocky shores of the island of Capri seem to
                  pulsate through the dreamy, shifting mists that veil its sides; and the sea
                  shimmers and glitters like the neck of a peacock with an iridescent mingling of
                  colors: the whole air is a glorifying medium, rich in prismatic hues of
                  enchantment.</p>
               <p>The town on three sides is severed from the main land by a gorge two hundred feet
                  in depth and forty or fifty in breadth, crossed by a bridge resting on double
                  arches, the construction of which dates back to the time of the ancient Romans.
                  This bridge affords a favorite lounging-place for the inhabitants, and at evening
                  a motley assemblage may be seen lolling over its moss-grown sides,—men with their
                  picturesque knit caps of scarlet or brown falling gracefully on one shoulder, and
                  women with their shining black hair and the enormous pearl ear-rings which are the
                  pride and heirlooms of every family. The present traveller at Sorrento may
                  remember standing on this bridge and looking down the gloomy depths of the gorge,
                  to where a fair villa, with its groves of orange-trees and gardens, overhangs the
                  tremendous depths below.</p>
               <p>Hundreds of years since, where this villa now stands was the simple dwelling of
                  the two women whose history we have begun to tell you. There you might have seen a
                  small stone cottage with a two-arched arcade in front, gleaming brilliantly white
                  out of the dusky foliage of an orange-orchard. The dwelling was wedged like a
                  bird-box between two fragments of rock, and behind it the land rose rocky, high,
                  and steep, so as to form a natural wall. A small ledge or terrace of cultivated
                  land here hung in air,—below it, a precipice of two hundred feet down into the
                  Gorge of Sorrento. A couple of dozen orange-trees, straight and tall, with
                  healthy, shining bark, here shot up from the fine black volcanic soil, and made
                  with their foliage a twilight shadow on the ground, so deep that no vegetation,
                  save a fine velvet moss, could dispute their claim to its entire nutritious
                  offices. These trees were the sole wealth of the women and the sole ornament of
                  the garden; but, as they stood there, not only laden with golden fruit, but
                  fragrant with pearly blossoms, they made the little rocky platform seem a perfect
                  Garden of the Hesperides. The stone cottage, as we have said, had an open,
                  whitewashed arcade in front, from which one could look down into the gloomy depths
                  of the gorge, as into some mysterious underworld. Strange and weird it seemed,
                  with its fathomless shadows and its wild grottoes, over which hung, silently
                  waving, long pendants of ivy, while dusky gray aloes uplifted their horned heads
                  from great rock-rifts, like elfin spirits struggling upward out of the shade. Nor
                  was wanting the usual gentle poetry of flowers; for white iris leaned its fairy
                  pavilion over the black void like a pale-cheeked princess from the window of some
                  dark enchanted castle, and scarlet geranium and golden broom and crimson gladiolus
                  waved and glowed in the shifting beams of<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7945-00000010"/>
                  the sunlight. Also there was in this little spot what forms the charm of Italian
                  gardens always,—the sweet song and prattle of waters. A clear mountain-spring
                  burst through the rock on one side of the little cottage, and fell with a lulling
                  noise into a quaint moss-grown water-trough, which had been in former times the
                  sarcophagus of some old Roman sepulchre. Its sides were richly sculptured with
                  figures and leafy scrolls and arabesques, into which the sly-footed lichens with
                  quiet growth had so insinuated themselves as in some places almost to obliterate
                  the original design; while, round the place where the water fell, a veil of ferns
                  and maiden's hair, studded with tremulous silver drops, vibrated to its soothing
                  murmur. The superfluous waters, drained off by a little channel on one side, were
                  conducted through the rocky parapet of the garden, whence they trickled and
                  tinkled from rock to rock, falling with a continual drip among the swaying ferns
                  and pendent ivy-wreaths, till they reached the little stream at the bottom of the
                  gorge. This parapet or garden-wall was formed of blocks or fragments of what had
                  once been white marble, the probable remains of the ancient tomb from which the
                  sarcophagus was taken. Here and there a marble acanthus-leaf, or the capital of an
                  old column, or a fragment of sculpture jutted from under the mosses, ferns, and
                  grasses with which prodigal Nature had filled every interstice and carpeted the
                  whole. These sculptured fragments everywhere in Italy seem to whisper from the
                  dust, of past life and death, of a cycle of human existence forever gone, over
                  whose tomb the life of to-day is built.</p>
               <p>"Sit down and rest, my dove," said Dame Elsie to her little charge, as they
                  entered their little enclosure.</p>
               <p>Here she saw for the first time, what she had not noticed in the heat and hurry of
                  her ascent, that the girl was panting and her gentle bosom rising and falling in
                  thick heart-beats, occasioned by the haste with which she had drawn her
                  onward.</p>
               <p>"Sit down, dearie, and I will get you a bit of supper."</p>
               <p>"Yes, grandmother, I will. I must tell my beads once for the soul of the handsome
                  gentleman that kissed my forehead to-night."</p>
               <p>"How did you know that he was handsome, child?" said the old dame, with some
                  sharpness in her voice.</p>
               <p>"He bade me look on him, grandmother, and I saw it."</p>
               <p>"You must put such thoughts away, child," said the old dame.</p>
               <p>"Why must I?" said the girl, looking up with an eye as clear and unconscious as
                  that of a three-year old child.</p>
               <p>"If she does not think, why should I tell her?" said Dame Elsie, as she turned to
                  go into the house, and left the child sitting on the mossy parapet that overlooked
                  the gorge. Thence she could see far off, not only down the dim, sombre abyss, but
                  out to the blue Mediterranean beyond, now calmly lying in swathing-bands of
                  purple, gold, and orange, while the smoky cloud that overhung Vesuvius became
                  silver and rose in the evening light.</p>
               <p>There is always something of elevation and purity that seems to come over one from
                  being in an elevated region. One feels morally as well as physically above the
                  world, and from that clearer air able to look down on it calmly with disengaged
                  freedom. Our little maiden sat for a few moments gazing, her large brown eyes
                  dilating with a tremulous lustre, as if tears were half of a mind to start in
                  them, and her lips apart with a delicate earnestness, like one who is pursuing
                  some pleasing inner thought. Suddenly rousing<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000011"/> herself, she began by breaking the freshest
                  orange-blossoms from the golden-fruited trees, and, kissing and pressing them to
                  her bosom, she proceeded to remove the faded flowers of the morning from before a
                  little rude shrine in the rock, where, in a sculptured niche, was a picture of the
                  Madonna and Child, with a locked glass door in front of it. The picture was a
                  happy transcript of one of the fairest creations of the religious school of
                  Florence, done by one of those rustic copyists of whom Italy is full, who appear
                  to possess the instinct of painting, and to whom we owe many of those sweet faces
                  which sometimes look down on us by the wayside from rudest and homeliest
                  shrines.</p>
               <p>The poor fellow by whom it had been painted was one to whom years before Dame
                  Elsie had given food and shelter for many months during a lingering illness; and
                  he had painted so much of his dying heart and hopes into it that it had a peculiar
                  and vital vividness in its power of affecting the feelings. Agnes had been
                  familiar with this picture from early infancy. No day of her life had the flowers
                  failed to be freshly placed before it. It had seemed to smile down sympathy on her
                  childish joys, and to cloud over with her childish sorrows. It was less a picture
                  to her than a presence; and the whole air of the little orange-garden seemed to be
                  made sacred by it. When she had arranged her flowers, she kneeled down and began
                  to say prayers for the soul of the young gallant.</p>
               <p>"Holy Jesus," she said, "he is young, rich, handsome, and a king's brother; and
                  for all these things the Fiend may tempt him to forget his God and throw away his
                  soul. Holy Mother, give him good counsel!"</p>
               <p>"Come, child, to your supper," said Dame Elsie. "I have milked the goats, and
                  everything is ready."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE GORGE.</head>
               <p>AFTER her light supper was over, Agnes took her distaff, wound with shining white
                  flax, and went and seated herself in her favorite place, on the low parapet that
                  overlooked the gorge.</p>
               <p>This ravine, with its dizzy depths, its waving foliage, its dripping springs, and
                  the low murmur of the little stream that pursued its way far down at the bottom,
                  was one of those things which stimulated her impressible imagination, and filled
                  her with a solemn and vague delight. The ancient Italian tradition made it the
                  home of fauns and dryads, wild woodland creatures, intermediate links between
                  vegetable life and that of sentient and reasoning humanity. The more earnest faith
                  that came in with Christianity, if it had its brighter lights in an immortality of
                  blessedness, had also its deeper shadows in the intenser perceptions it awakened
                  of sin and evil, and of the mortal struggle by which the human spirit must avoid
                  endless woe and rise to endless felicity. The myths with which the colored Italian
                  air was filled in mediæval ages no longer resembled those graceful, floating,
                  cloud-like figures one sees in the ancient chambers of Pompeii,—the bubbles and
                  rainbows of human fancy, rising aimless and buoyant, with a mere freshness of
                  animal life, against a black background of utter and hopeless ignorance as to
                  man's past or future. They were rather expressed by solemn images<pb n="22-23"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000012"/> of mournful, majestic angels and of triumphant
                  saints, or fearful, warning presentations of loathsome fiends. Each lonesome gorge
                  and sombre dell had tales no more of tricky fauns and dryads, but of those
                  restless, wandering demons who, having lost their own immortality of blessedness,
                  constantly lie in wait to betray frail humanity, and cheat it of that glorious
                  inheritance bought by the Great Redemption.</p>
               <p>The education of Agnes had been one which rendered her whole system peculiarly
                  sensitive and impressible to all influences from the invisible and unseen. Of this
                  education we shall speak more particularly hereafter. At present we see her
                  sitting in the twilight on the moss-grown marble parapet, her distaff, with its
                  silvery flax, lying idly in her hands, and her widening dark eyes gazing intently
                  into the gloomy gorge below, from which arose the far-off complaining babble of
                  the brook at the bottom and the shiver and sigh of evening winds through the
                  trailing ivy. The white mist was slowly rising, wavering, undulating, and creeping
                  its slow way up the sides of the gorge. Now it hid a tuft of foliage, and now it
                  wreathed itself around a horned clump of aloes, and, streaming far down below it
                  in the dimness, made it seem like the goblin robe of some strange, supernatural
                  being.</p>
               <p>The evening light had almost burned out in the sky: only a band of vivid red lay
                  low in the horizon out to sea, and the round full moon was just rising like a
                  great silver lamp, while Vesuvius with its smoky top began in the obscurity to
                  show its faintly flickering fires. A vague agitation seemed to oppress the child;
                  for she sighed deeply, and often repeated with fervor the Ave Maria.</p>
               <p>At this moment there began to rise from the very depths of the gorge below her the
                  sound of a rich tenor voice, with a slow, sad modulation, and seeming to pulsate
                  upward through the filmy, shifting mists. It was one of those voices which seem
                  fit to be the outpouring of some spirit denied all other gifts of expression, and
                  rushing with passionate fervor through this one gate of utterance. So distinctly
                  were the words spoken, that they seemed each one to rise as with a separate
                  intelligence out of the mist, and to knock at the door of the heart. <q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>There was such an intense earnestness in these sounds, that large tears gathered
                  in the wide dark eyes, and fell one after another upon the sweet alyssum and
                  maiden's-hair that grew in the crevices of the marble wall. She shivered and drew
                  away from the parapet, and thought of stories she had heard the nuns tell of
                  wandering spirits who sometimes in lonesome places pour forth such entrancing
                  music as bewilders the brain of the unwary listener, and leads him to some fearful
                  destruction.</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7945-00000013"/>
               <p>"Agnes!" said the sharp voice of old Elsie, appearing at the door,—here! where are
                  you!"</p>
               <p>"Here, grandmamma."</p>
               <p>"Who's that singing this time o' night?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know, grandmamma."</p>
               <p>Somehow the child felt as if that singing were strangely sacred to her,—a
                     <emph>rapport</emph> between her and something vague and invisible which might
                  yet become dear.</p>
               <p>"Is't down in the gorge?" said the old woman, coming with her heavy, decided step
                  to the parapet, and looking over, her keen black eyes gleaming like dagger-blades
                  into the mist. "If there's anybody there," she said, "let them go away, and not be
                  troubling honest women with any of their caterwauling. Come, Agnes," she said,
                  pulling the girl by the sleeve, "you must be tired, my lamb! and your
                  evening-prayers are always so long, best be about them, girl, so that old
                  grandmamma may put you to bed. What ails the girl? Been crying! Your hand is cold
                  as a stone."</p>
               <p>"Grandmamma, what if that might be a spirit?" she said. "Sister Rosa told me
                  stories of singing spirits that have been in this very gorge."</p>
               <p>"Likely enough," said Dame Elsie; "but what's that to us? Let 'em sing!—so long as
                  we don't listen, where's the harm done? We will sprinkle holy water all round the
                  parapet, and say the office of Saint Agnes, and let them sing till they are
                  hoarse."</p>
               <p>Such was the triumphant view which this energetic good woman took of the power of
                  the means of grace which her church placed at her disposal.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, while Agnes was kneeling at her evening-prayers, the old dame
                  consoled herself with a soliloquy, as with a brush she vigorously besprinkled the
                  premises with holy water.</p>
               <p>"Now, here's the plague of a girl! If she's handsome,—and nobody wants one that is
                  n't,—why, then, it's a purgatory to look after her. This one is good enough,—none
                  of your hussies, like Giulietta: but the better they are, the more sure to have
                  fellows after them. A murrain on that cavalier,—king's brother, or what not!—it
                  was he serenading, I'll be bound. I must tell Antonio, and have the girl married,
                  for aught I see: and I don't want to give her to him either; he did n't bring her
                  up. There's no peace for us mothers. Maybe I'll tell Father Francesco about it.
                  That's the way poor little Isella was carried away. Singing is of the Devil, I
                  believe; it always bewitches girls. I'd like to have poured some hot oil down the
                  rocks: I'd have made him squeak in another tone, I reckon. Well, well! I hope I
                  shall come in for a good seat in paradise for all the trouble I've had with her
                  mother, and am like to have with her,—that's all!"</p>
               <p>In an hour more, the large, round, sober moon was shining fixedly on the little
                  mansion in the rocks, silvering the glossy darkness of the orange-leaves, while
                  the scent of the blossoms arose like clouds about the cottage. The moonlight
                  streamed through the unglazed casement, and made a square of light on the little
                  bed where Agnes was sleeping, in which square her delicate face was framed, with
                  its tremulous and spiritual expression most resembling in its sweet plaintive
                  purity some of the Madonna faces of Frà Angelico,—those tender wild-flowers of
                  Italian religion and poetry.</p>
               <p>By her side lay her grandmother, with those sharp, hard, clearly cut features, so
                  worn and bronzed by time, so lined with labor and care, as to resemble one of the
                  Fates in the picture of Michel Angelo; and even in her sleep she held<pb n="26-27"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000014"/> the delicate lily hand of the child in her own
                  hard, brown one, with a strong and determined clasp.</p>
               <p>While they sleep, we must tell something more of the story of the little Agnes,—of
                  what she is, and what are the causes which have made her such.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">WHO AND WHAT.</head>
               <p>OLD Elsie was not born a peasant. Originally she was the wife of a steward in one
                  of those great families of Rome whose state and traditions were princely. Elsie,
                  as her figure and profile and all her words and movements indicated, was of a
                  strong, shrewd, ambitious, and courageous character, and well disposed to turn to
                  advantage every gift with which Nature had endowed her.</p>
               <p>Providence made her a present of a daughter whose beauty was wonderful, even in a
                  country where beauty is no uncommon accident. In addition to her beauty, the
                  little Isella had quick intelligence, wit, grace, and spirit. As a child she
                  became the pet and plaything of the Princess whom Elsie served. This noble lady,
                  pressed by the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ennui</foreign> which is always the moth
                  and rust on the purple and gold of rank and wealth, had, as other noble ladies had
                  in those days, and have now, sundry pets: greyhounds, white and delicate, that
                  looked as if they were made of Sèvres china; spaniels with long silky ears and
                  fringy paws; apes and monkeys, that made at times sad devastations in her
                  wardrobe; and a most charming little dwarf, that was ugly enough to frighten the
                  very owls, and spiteful as he was ugly. She had, moreover, peacocks, and macaws,
                  and parrots, and all sorts of singing-birds, and falcons of every breed, and
                  horses, and hounds,—in short, there is no saying what she did <emph>not</emph>
                  have. One day she took it into her<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7945-00000015"/> head
                  to add the little Isella to the number of her acquisitions. With the easy grace of
                  aristocracy, she reached out her jewelled hand and took Elsie's one flower to add
                  to her conservatory,—and Elsie was only too proud to have it so.</p>
               <p>Her daughter was kept constantly about the person of the Princess, and instructed
                  in all the wisdom which would have been allowed her, had she been the Princess's
                  own daughter, which, to speak the truth, was in those days nothing very
                  profound,—consisting of a little singing and instrumentation, a little embroidery
                  and dancing, with the power of writing her own name and of reading a
                  love-letter.</p>
               <p>All the world knows that the very idea of a pet is something to be spoiled for the
                  amusement of the pet-owner; and Isella was spoiled in the most particular and
                  circumstantial manner. She had suits of apparel for every day in the year, and
                  jewels without end,—for the Princess was never weary of trying the effect of her
                  beauty in this and that costume; so that she sported through the great grand halls
                  and down the long aisles of the garden much like a bright-winged humming-bird, or
                  a damsel-fly all green and gold. She was a genuine child of Italy,—full of
                  feeling, spirit, and genius,—alive in every nerve to the finger-tips; and under
                  the tropical sunshine of her mistress's favor she grew as an Italian rose-bush
                  does, throwing its branches freakishly over everything in a wild labyrinth of
                  perfume, brightness, and thorns.</p>
               <p>For a while her life was a triumph, and her mother triumphed with her at an humble
                  distance. The Princess was devoted to her with the blind fatuity with which ladies
                  of rank at times will invest themselves in a caprice. She arrogated to herself all
                  the praises of her beauty and wit, allowed lowed her to flirt and make conquests
                  to her heart's content, and engaged to marry her to some handsome young officer of
                  her train, when she had done being amused with her.</p>
               <p>Now we must not wonder that a young head of fifteen should have been turned by
                  this giddy elevation, nor that an old head of fifty should have thought all things
                  were possible in the fortune of such a favorite. Nor must we wonder that the young
                  coquette, rich in the laurels of a hundred conquests, should have turned her
                  bright eyes on the son and heir, when he came home from the University of Bologna.
                  Nor is it to be wondered at that this same son and heir, being a man as well as a
                  Prince, should have done as other men did,—fallen desperately in love with this
                  dazzling, sparkling, piquant mixture of matter and spirit, which no university can
                  prepare a young man to comprehend,—which always seemed to run from him, and yet
                  always threw a Parthian shot behind her as she fled. Nor is it to be wondered at,
                  if this same prince, after a week or two, did not know whether he was on his head
                  or his heels, or whether the sun rose in the east or the south, or where he stood,
                  or whither he was going.</p>
               <p>In fact, the youthful pair very soon came into that dreamland where are no more
                  any points of the compass, no more division of time, no more latitude and
                  longitude, no more up and down, but only a general wandering among enchanted
                  groves and singing nightingales.</p>
               <p>It was entirely owing to old Elsie's watchful shrewdness and address that the
                  lovers came into this paradise by the gate of marriage; for the young man was
                  ready to offer anything at the feet of his divinity, as the old mother was not
                  slow to perceive.</p>
               <p>So they stood at the altar for the time being a pair of as<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000016"/> true lovers as Romeo and Juliet: but then, what has
                  true love to do with the son of a hundred generations and heir to a Roman
                  principality?</p>
               <p>Of course, the rose of love, having gone through all its stages of bud and blossom
                  into full flower, must next begin to drop its leaves. Of course. Who ever heard of
                  an immortal rose?</p>
               <p>The time of discovery came. Isella was found to be a mother; and then the storm
                  burst upon her and drabbled her in the dust as fearlessly as the summer-wind
                  sweeps down and besmirches the lily it has all summer been wooing and
                  flattering.</p>
               <p>The Princess was a very pious and moral lady, and of course threw her favorite out
                  into the street as a vile weed, and virtuously ground her down under her jewelled
                  high-heeled shoes.</p>
               <p>She could have forgiven her any common frailty;—of course it was natural that the
                  girl should have been seduced by the all-conquering charms of her son;—but aspire
                  to <emph>marriage</emph> with their house!—pretend to be her son's
                     <emph>wife!</emph> Since the time of Judas had such treachery ever been heard
                  of?</p>
               <p>Something was said of the propriety of walling up the culprit alive,—a mode of
                  disposing of small family-matters somewhat <foreign xml:lang="FRA">à la
                     mode</foreign> in those times. But the Princess acknowledged herself foolishly
                  tender, and unable quite to allow this very obvious propriety in the case.</p>
               <p>She contented herself with turning mother and daughter into the streets with every
                  mark of ignominy, which was reduplicated by every one of her servants, lackeys,
                  and court-companions, who, of course, had always known just how the thing must
                  end.</p>
               <p>As to the young Prince he acted as a well-instructed young nobleman should, who
                  understands the great difference there is between the tears of a duchess and those
                  of low-born women. No sooner did he behold his conduct in the light of his
                  mother's countenance than he turned his back on his low marriage with edifying
                  penitence. He did not think it necessary to convince his mother of the real
                  existence of a union whose very supposition made her so unhappy, and occasioned
                  such an uncommonly disagreeable and tempestuous state of things in the well-bred
                  circle where his birth called him to move. Being, however, a religious youth, he
                  opened his mind to his family-confessor, by whose advice he sent a messenger with
                  a large sum of money to Elsie, piously commending her and her daughter to the
                  Divine protection. He also gave orders for an entire new suit of raiment for the
                  Virgin Mary in the family-chapel, including a splendid set of diamonds, and
                  promised unlimited candles to the altar of a neighboring convent. If all this
                  could not atone for a youthful error, it was a pity. So he thought, as he drew on
                  his riding-gloves and went off on a hunting-party, like a gallant and religious
                  young nobleman.</p>
               <p>Elsie, meanwhile, with her forlorn and disgraced daughter, found a temporary
                  asylum in a neighboring mountain-village, where the poor, bedrabbled,
                  broken-winged song-bird soon panted and fluttered her little life away.</p>
               <p>When the once beautiful and gay Isella had been hidden in the grave, cold and
                  lonely, there remained a little wailing infant, which Elsie gathered to her
                  bosom.</p>
               <p>Grim, dauntless, and resolute, she resolved, for the sake of this hapless one, to
                  look life in the face once more, and try the battle under other skies.</p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7945-00000017"/>
               <p>Taking the infant in her arms, she travelled with her far from the scene of her
                  birth, and set all her energies at work to make for her a better destiny than that
                  which had fallen to the lot of her unfortunate mother.</p>
               <p>She set about to create her nature and order her fortunes with that sort of
                  downright energy with which resolute people always attack the problem of a new
                  human existence. This child <emph>should be happy</emph>; the rocks on which her
                  mother was wrecked she should never strike upon,—they were all marked on Elsie's
                  chart. Love had been the root of all poor Isella's troubles,—and Agnes never
                  should know love, till taught it safely by a husband of Elsie's own choosing.</p>
               <p>The first step of security was in naming her for the chaste Saint Agnes, and
                  placing her girlhood under her special protection. Secondly, which was quite as
                  much to the point, she brought her up laboriously in habits of incessant
                  industry,—never suffering her to be out of her sight, or to have any connection or
                  friendship, except such as could be carried on under the immediate supervision of
                  her piercing black eyes. Every night she put her to bed as if she had been an
                  infant, and, wakening her again in the morning, took her with her in all her daily
                  toils,—of which, to do her justice, she performed all the hardest portion, leaving
                  to the girl just enough to keep her hands employed and her head steady.</p>
               <p>The peculiar circumstance which had led her to choose the old town of Sorrento for
                  her residence, in preference to any of the beautiful villages which impearl that
                  fertile plain, was the existence there of a flourishing convent dedicated to Saint
                  Agnes, under whose protecting shadow her young charge might more securely spend
                  the earlier years of her life.</p>
               <p>With this view, having hired the domicile we have already ready described, she
                  lost no time in making the favorable acquaintance of the sisterhood,—never coming
                  to them empty-handed. The finest oranges of her garden, the whitest flax of her
                  spinning, were always reserved as offerings at the shrine of the patroness whom
                  she sought to propitiate for her grandchild.</p>
               <p>In her earliest childhood the little Agnes was led toddling to the shrine by her
                  zealous relative; and at the sight of her fair, sweet, awe-struck face, with its
                  viny mantle of encircling curls, the torpid bosoms of the sisterhood throbbed with
                  a strange, new pleasure, which they humbly hoped was not sinful,—as agreeable
                  things, they found, generally were. They loved the echoes of her little feet down
                  the damp, silent aisles of their chapel, and her small, sweet, slender voice, as
                  she asked strange baby-questions, which, as usual with baby-questions, hit all the
                  insoluble points of philosophy and theology exactly on the head.</p>
               <p>The child became a special favorite with the Abbess, Sister Theresa, a tall, thin,
                  bloodless, sad-eyed woman, who looked as if she might have been cut out of one of
                  the glaciers of Monte Rosa, but in whose heart the little fair one had made
                  herself a niche, pushing her way up through, as you may have seen a lovely
                  blue-fringed gentian standing in a snow-drift of the Alps with its little ring of
                  melted snow around it.</p>
               <p>Sister Theresa offered to take care of the child at any time when the grandmother
                  wished to be about her labors; and so, during her early years, the little one was
                  often domesticated for days together at the Convent. A perfect mythology of
                  wonderful stories encircled her, which the good sisters were never tired of
                  repeating to each other. They were the simplest sayings and doings of
                     childhood,—<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7945-00000018"/> handfuls of such
                  wild-flowers as bespread the green turf of nursery-life everywhere, but miraculous
                  blossoms in the eyes of these good women, whom Saint Agnes had unwittingly
                  deprived of any power of making comparisons or ever having Christ's sweetest
                  parable of the heavenly kingdom enacted in homes of their own.</p>
               <p>Old Jocunda, the porteress, never failed to make a sensation with her one
                  stock-story of how she found the child standing on her head and crying,—having
                  been put into this reversed position in consequence of climbing up on a high stool
                  to get her little fat hand into the vase of holy water, failing in which Christian
                  attempt, her heels went up and her head down, greatly to her dismay.</p>
               <p>"Nevertheless," said old Jocunda, gravely, "it showed an edifying turn in the
                  child; and when I lifted the little thing up, it stopped crying the minute its
                  little fingers touched the water, and it made a cross on its forehead as sensible
                  as the oldest among us. Ah, sisters, there's grace there, or I'm mistaken."</p>
               <p>All the signs of an incipient saint were, indeed, manifested in the little one.
                  She never played the wild and noisy plays of common children, but busied herself
                  in making altars and shrines, which she adorned with the prettiest flowers of the
                  gardens, and at which she worked hour after hour in the quietest and happiest
                  earnestness. Her dreams were a constant source of wonder and edification in the
                  Convent, for they were all of angels and saints; and many a time, after hearing
                  one, the sisterhood crossed themselves, and the Abbess said, "<foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">Ex oribus parvulorum</foreign>." Always sweet, dutiful,
                  submissive, cradling herself every night with a lulling of sweet hymns and infant
                  murmur of prayers, and found sleeping in her little white bed with her crucifix
                  clasped to her bosom, it was no wonder that the Abbess thought her the special
                  favorite of her divine patroness, and, like her, the subject of an early vocation
                  to be the celestial bride of One fairer than the children of men, who should
                  snatch her away from all earthly things, to be united to Him in a celestial
                  paradise.</p>
               <p>As the child grew older, she often sat at evening with wide, wondering eyes,
                  listening over and over again to the story of the fair Saint Agnes:—How she was a
                  princess, living in her father's palace, of such exceeding beauty and grace that
                  none saw her but to love her, yet of such sweetness and humility as passed all
                  comparison; and how, when a heathen prince would have espoused her to his son, she
                  said, "Away from me, tempter! for I am betrothed to a lover who is greater and
                  fairer than any earthly suitor,—he is so fair that the sun and moon are ravished
                  by his beauty, so mighty that the angels of heaven are his servants;" how she bore
                  meekly with persecutions and threatenings and death for the sake of this unearthly
                  love; and when she had poured out her blood, how she came to her mourning friends
                  in ecstatic vision, all white and glistening, with a fair lamb by her side, and
                  bade them weep not for her, because she was reigning with Him whom on earth she
                  had preferred to all other lovers. There was also the legend of the fair Cecilia,
                  the lovely musician whom angels had rapt away to their choirs; the story of that
                  queenly saint, Catharine, who passed through the courts of heaven, and saw the
                  angels crowned with roses and lilies, and the Virgin on her throne, who gave her
                  the wedding-ring that espoused her to be the bride of the King Eternal.</p>
               <p>Fed with such legends, it could not be but that a child with a sensitive, nervous
                  organization and vivid imagination<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7945-00000019"/> should
                  have grown up with an unworldly and spiritual character, and that a poetic mist
                  should have enveloped all her outward perceptions similar to that palpitating veil
                  of blue and lilac vapor that enshrouds the Italian landscape.</p>
               <p>Nor is it to be marvelled at, if the results of this system of education went far
                  beyond what the good old grandmother intended. For, though a stanch good
                  Christian, after the manner of those times, yet she had not the slightest mind to
                  see her grand-daughter a nun; on the contrary, she was working day and night to
                  add to her dowry, and had in her eye a reputable middle-aged blacksmith, who was a
                  man of substance and prudence, to be the husband and keeper of her precious
                  treasure. In a home thus established she hoped to enthrone herself, and provide
                  for the rearing of a generation of stout-limbed girls and boys who should grow up
                  to make a flourishing household in the land. This subject she had not yet broached
                  to her grand-daughter, though daily preparing to do so,—deferring it, it must be
                  told, from a sort of jealous, yearning craving to have wholly to herself the child
                  for whom she had lived so many years.</p>
               <p>Antonio, the blacksmith to whom this honor was destined, was one of those
                  broad-backed, full-chested, long-limbed fellows one shall often see around
                  Sorrento, with great, kind, black eyes like those of an ox, and all the attributes
                  of a healthy, kindly, animal nature. Contentedly he hammered away at his business;
                  and certainly, had not Dame Elsie of her own providence elected him to be the
                  husband of her fair grand-daughter, he would never have thought of the matter
                  himself; but, opening the black eyes aforenamed upon the girl, he perceived that
                  she was fair, and also received an inner light through Dame Elsie as to the amount
                  of her dowry; and, putting these matters together, conceived a kindness for the
                  maiden, and awaited with tranquillity the time when he should be allowed to
                  commence his wooing.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <head type="sub">IL PADRE FRANCESCO.</head>
               <p>THE next morning Elsie awoke, as was her custom, when the very faintest hue of
                  dawn streaked the horizon. A hen who has seen a hawk balancing his wings and
                  cawing in mid-air over her downy family could not have awakened with her feathers,
                  metaphorically speaking, in a more bristling state of caution.</p>
               <p>"Spirits in the gorge, quotha?" said she to herself, as she vigorously adjusted
                  her dress. "I believe so,—spirits in good sound bodies, I believe; and next we
                  shall hear, there will be rope-ladders, and climbings, and the Lord knows what. I
                  shall go to confession this very morning, and tell Father Francesco the danger;
                  and instead of taking her down to sell oranges, suppose I send her to the sisters
                  to carry the ring and a basket of oranges?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, ah!" she said, pausing, after she was dressed, and addressing a coarse print
                  of Saint Agnes pasted against the wall,—"you look very meek there, and it was a
                  great thing no doubt to die as you did; but if you'd lived to be married and bring
                  up a family of girls, you'd have known something greater. Please, don't take
                  offence with a poor old woman who has got into the way of speaking her mind
                  freely! I'm foolish, and don't know much,—so, dear lady, pray for me!" And old
                  Elsie bent her knee and crossed herself reverently, and then went out, leaving her
                  young charge still sleeping.</p>
               <p>It was yet dusky dawn when she might have been seen kneeling, with her sharp,
                  clear-cut profile, at the grate of a confession-box in a church in Sorrento.
                  Within was seated a personage who will have some influence on our story, and who
                  must therefore be somewhat minutely introduced to the reader.</p>
               <p>Il Padre Francesco had only within the last year arrived in the neighborhood,
                  having been sent as superior of a brotherhood of Capuchins, whose convent was
                  perched on a crag in the vicinity. With this situation came a pastoral care of the
                  district; and Elsie and her grand-daughter found in him a spiritual pastor very
                  different from the fat, jolly, easy Brother Girolamo, to whose place he had been
                  appointed. The latter had been one of those numerous priests taken from the
                  peasantry, who never rise above the average level of thought of the body from
                  which they are drawn. Easy, gossipy, fond of good living and good stories,
                  sympathetic in troubles and in joys, he had been a general favorite in the
                  neighborhood, without exerting any particularly spiritualizing influence.</p>
               <p>It required but a glance at Father Francesco to see that he was in all respects
                  the opposite of this. It was evident that he came from one of the higher classes,
                  by that indefinable air of birth and breeding which makes itself felt under every
                  change of costume. Who he might be, what might have been his past history, what
                  rank he might have borne, what part played in the great warfare of life, was all
                  of course sunk in the oblivion of his religious profession, where, as at the
                  grave, a man laid down name and fame and past history and worldly goods,<pb
                     n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7945-00000021"/> and took up a coarse garb and a name
                  chosen from the roll of the saints, in sign that the world that had known him
                  should know him no more.</p>
               <p>Imagine a man between thirty and forty, with that round, full, evenly developed
                  head, and those chiselled features, which one sees on ancient busts and coins no
                  less than in the streets of modern Rome. The cheeks were sunken and sallow; the
                  large, black, melancholy eyes had a wistful, anxious, penetrative expression, that
                  spoke a stringent, earnest spirit, which, however deep might be the grave in which
                  it lay buried, had not yet found repose. The long, thin, delicately formed hands
                  were emaciated and bloodless; they clasped with a nervous eagerness a rosary and
                  crucifix of ebony and silver,—the only mark of luxury that could be discerned in a
                  costume unusually threadbare and squalid. The whole picture of the man, as he sat
                  there, had it been painted and hung in a gallery, was such as must have stopped
                  every person of a certain amount of sensibility before it with the conviction that
                  behind that strong, melancholy, earnest figure and face lay one of those hidden
                  histories of human passion in which the vivid life of mediæval Italy was so
                  fertile.</p>
               <p>He was listening to Elsie, as she kneeled, with that easy air of superiority which
                  marks a practised man of the world, yet with a grave attention which showed that
                  her communication had awakened the deepest interest in his mind. Every few moments
                  he moved slightly in his seat, and interrupted the flow of the narrative by an
                  inquiry concisely put, in tones which, clear and low, had a solemn and severe
                  distinctness, producing, in the still, dusky twilight of the church, an almost
                  ghostly effect.</p>
               <p>When the communication was over, he stepped out of the confessional and said to
                  Elsie in parting,—"My daughter, you have done well to take this in time. The
                  devices of Satan in our corrupt times are numerous and artful, and they who keep
                  the Lord's sheep must not sleep. Before many days I will call and examine the
                  child; meanwhile I approve your course."</p>
               <p>It was curious to see the awe-struck, trembling manner in which old Elsie,
                  generally so intrepid and commanding, stood before this man in his brown rough
                  woollen gown with his corded waist; but she had an instinctive perception of the
                  presence of the man of superior birth no less than a reverence for the man of
                  religion.</p>
               <p>After she had departed from the church, the Capuchin stood lost in thought; and to
                  explain his revery, we must throw some further light on his history.</p>
               <p>Il Padre Francesco, as his appearance and manner intimated, was in truth from one
                  of the most distinguished families of Florence. He was one of those whom an
                  ancient writer characterizes as "men of longing desire." Born with a nature of
                  restless stringency that seemed to doom him never to know repose, excessive in all
                  things, he had made early trial of ambition, of war, and of what the gallants of
                  his time called love,—plunging into all the dissipated excesses of a most
                  dissolute age, and outdoing in luxury and extravagance the foremost of his
                  companions.</p>
               <p>The wave of a great religious impulse—which in our times would have been called a
                  revival—swept over the city of Florence, and bore him, with multitudes of others,
                  to listen to the fervid preaching of the Dominican monk, Jerome Savonarola; and
                  amid the crowd that trembled, wept, and beat their breasts under his awful
                  denunciations, he, too,<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7945-00000022"/> felt within
                  himself a heavenly call,—the death of an old life, and the uprising of a new
                  purpose.</p>
               <p>The colder manners and more repressed habits of modern times can give no idea of
                  the wild fervor of a religious revival among a people so passionate and
                  susceptible to impressions as the Italians. It swept society like a spring torrent
                  from the sides of the Apennines, bearing all before it. Houses were sacked with
                  religious fervor by penitent owners, and licentious pictures and statuary and
                  books, and all the thousand temptations and appliances of a luxurious age, were
                  burned in the great public square. Artists convicted of impure and licentious
                  designs threw their palettes and brushes into the expiatory flames, and retired to
                  convents, till called forth by the voice of the preacher, and bid to turn their
                  art into higher channels. Since the days of Saint Francis no such profound
                  religious impulse had agitated the Italian community.</p>
               <p>In our times a conversion is signalized by few outward changes, however deep the
                  inner life; but the life of the Middle Ages was profoundly symbolical, and always
                  required the help of material images in its expression.</p>
               <p>The gay and dissolute young Lorenzo Sforza took leave of the world with rites of
                  awful solemnity. He made his will and disposed of all his worldly property, and
                  assembling his friends, bade them the farewell of a dying man. Arrayed as for the
                  grave, he was laid in his coffin, and thus carried from his stately dwelling by
                  the brethren of the Misericordia, who, in their ghostly costume, with mournful
                  chants and lighted candles, bore him to the tomb of his ancestors, where the
                  coffin was deposited in the vault, and its occupant passed the awful hours of the
                  night in darkness and solitude. Thence he was carried, the next day, almost in a
                  state of insensibility, to a neighboring convent of the severest order, where, for
                  some weeks, he observed a penitential retreat of silence and prayer, neither
                  seeing nor hearing any living being but his spiritual director.</p>
               <p>The effect of all this on an ardent and sensitive temperament can scarcely be
                  conceived; and it is not to be wondered at that the once gay and luxurious Lorenzo
                  Sforza, when emerging from this tremendous discipline, was so wholly lost in the
                  worn and weary Padre Francesco that it seemed as if in fact he had died and
                  another had stepped into his place. The face was ploughed deep with haggard
                  furrows, and the eyes were as those of a man who has seen the fearful secrets of
                  another life. He voluntarily sought a post as far removed as possible from the
                  scenes of his early days, so as more completely to destroy his identity with the
                  past; and he devoted himself with enthusiasm to the task of awakening to a higher
                  spiritual life the indolent, self-indulgent monks of his order, and the ignorant
                  peasantry of the vicinity.</p>
               <p>But he soon discovered, what every earnest soul learns who has been baptized into
                  a sense of things invisible, how utterly powerless and inert any mortal man is to
                  inspire others with his own insights and convictions. With bitter discouragement
                  and chagrin, he saw that the spiritual man must forever lift the dead weight of
                  all the indolence and indifference and animal sensuality that surround him,—that
                  the curse of Cassandra is upon him, forever to burn and writhe under awful visions
                  of truths which no one around him will regard. In early life the associate only of
                  the cultivated and the refined, Father Francesco could not but experience at times
                  an insupportable <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ennui</foreign> in listening to the
                  confessions of people who had never learned either to<pb n="44-45"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000023"/> think or to feel with any degree of distinctness,
                  and whom his most fervent exhortations could not lift above the most trivial
                  interests of a mere animal life. He was weary of the childish quarrels and
                  bickerings of the monks, of their puerility, of their selfishness and
                  self-indulgence, of their hopeless vulgarity of mind, and utterly discouraged with
                  their inextricable labyrinths of deception. A melancholy deep as the grave seized
                  on him, and he redoubled his austerities, in the hope that by making life painful
                  he might make it also short.</p>
               <p>But the first time that the clear, sweet tones of Agnes rang in his ears at the
                  confessional, and her words, so full of unconscious poetry and repressed genius,
                  came like a strain of sweet music through the grate, he felt at his heart a thrill
                  to which it had long been a stranger, and which seemed to lift the weary, aching
                  load from off his soul, as if some invisible angel had borne it up on his
                  wings.</p>
               <p>In his worldly days he had known women as the gallants in Boccaccio's romances
                  knew them, and among them one enchantress whose sorceries had kindled in his heart
                  one of those fatal passions which burn out the whole of a man's nature, and leave
                  it, like a sacked city, only a smouldering heap of ashes. Deepest, therefore,
                  among his vows of renunciation had been those which divided him from all
                  womankind. The gulf that parted him and them was in his mind deep as hell, and he
                  thought of the sex only in the light of temptation and danger. For the first time
                  in his life, an influence serene, natural, healthy, and sweet breathed over him
                  from the mind of a woman,—an influence so heavenly and peaceful that he did not
                  challenge or suspect it, but rather opened his worn heart insensibly to it, as one
                  in a fetid chamber naturally breathes freer when the fresh air is admitted.</p>
               <p>How charming it was to find his most spiritual exhortations seized upon with the
                  eager comprehension of a nature innately poetic and ideal! Nay, it sometimes
                  seemed to him as if the suggestions which he gave her dry and leafless she brought
                  again to him in miraculous clusters of flowers, like the barren rod of Joseph,
                  which broke into blossoms when he was betrothed to the spotless Mary; and yet,
                  withal, she was so humbly unconscious, so absolutely ignorant of the beauty of all
                  she said and thought, that she impressed him less as a mortal woman than as one of
                  those divine miracles in feminine form of which he had heard in the legends of the
                  saints.</p>
               <p>Thenceforward his barren, discouraged life began to blossom with way-side
                  flowers,—and he mistrusted not the miracle, because the flowers were all heavenly.
                  The pious thought or holy admonition that he saw trodden under the swinish feet of
                  the monks he gathered up again in hope,—<emph>she</emph> would understand it; and
                  gradually all his thoughts became like carrier-doves, which, having once learned
                  the way to a favorite haunt, are ever fluttering to return thither.</p>
               <p>Such is the wonderful power of human sympathy, that the discovery even of the
                  existence of a soul capable of understanding our inner life often operates as a
                  perfect charm; every thought, and feeling, and aspiration carries with it a new
                  value, from the interwoven consciousness that attends it of the worth it would
                  bear to that other mind; so that, while that person lives, our existence is
                  doubled in value, even though oceans divide us.</p>
               <p>The cloud of hopeless melancholy which had brooded over the mind of Father
                  Francesco lifted and sailed away, he knew not why, he knew not when. A secret
                  joyfulness and alacrity possessed his spirits; his prayers became more fervent<pb
                     n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7945-00000024"/> vent and his praises more frequent. Until
                  now, his meditations had been most frequently those of fear and wrath,—the awful
                  majesty of God, the terrible punishment of sinners, which he conceived with all
                  that haggard, dreadful sincerity of vigor which characterized the modern Etruscan
                  phase of religion of which the "Inferno" of Dante was the exponent and the
                  out-come. His preachings and his exhortations had dwelt on that lurid world seen
                  by the severe Florentine, at whose threshold hope forever departs, and around
                  whose eternal circles of living torture the shivering spirit wanders dismayed and
                  blasted by terror.</p>
               <p>He had been shocked and discouraged to find how utterly vain had been his most
                  intense efforts to stem the course of sin by presenting these images of terror:
                  how hard natures had listened to them with only a coarse and cruel appetite, which
                  seemed to increase their hardness and brutality; and how timid ones had been
                  withered by them, like flowers scorched by the blast of a furnace; how, in fact,
                  as in the case of those cruel executions and bloody tortures then universal in the
                  jurisprudence of Europe, these pictures of eternal torture seemed to exert a
                  morbid demoralizing influence which hurried on the growth of iniquity.</p>
               <p>But since his acquaintance with Agnes, without his knowing exactly why, thoughts
                  of the Divine Love had floated into his soul, filling it with a golden cloud like
                  that which of old rested over the mercy-seat in that sacred inner temple where the
                  priest was admitted alone. He became more affable and tender, more tolerant to the
                  erring, more fond of little children; would stop sometimes to lay his hand on the
                  head of a child, or to raise up one who lay overthrown in the street. The song of
                  little birds and the voices of animal mal life became to him full of tenderness;
                  and his prayers by the sick and dying seemed to have a melting power, such as he
                  had never known before. It was spring in his soul,—soft, Italian spring,—such as
                  brings out the musky breath of the cyclamen, and the faint, tender perfume of the
                  primrose, in every moist dell of the Apennines.</p>
               <p>A year passed in this way, perhaps the best and happiest of his troubled life,—a
                  year in which, insensibly to himself, the weekly interviews with Agnes at the
                  confessional became the rallying-points around which the whole of his life was
                  formed, and she the unsuspected spring of his inner being.</p>
               <p>It was his duty, he said to himself, to give more than usual time and thought to
                  the working and polishing of this wondrous jewel which had so unexpectedly been
                  intrusted to him for the adorning of his Master's crown; and so long as he
                  conducted with the strictest circumspection of his office, what had he to fear in
                  the way of so delightful a duty? He had never touched her hand; never had even the
                  folds of her passing drapery brushed against his garments of mortification and
                  renunciation; never, even in pastoral benediction, had he dared lay his hand on
                  that beautiful head. It is true, he had not forbidden himself to raise his glance
                  sometimes when he saw her coming in at the church-door and gliding up the aisle
                  with downcast eyes, and thoughts evidently so far above earth, that she seemed,
                  like one of Frà Angelico's angels, to be moving on a cloud, so encompassed with
                  stillness and sanctity that he held his breath as she passed.</p>
               <p>But in the confession of Dame Elsie that morning he had received a shock which
                  threw his whole interior being into a passionate agitation which dismayed and
                  astonished him.</p>
               <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7945-00000025"/>
               <p>The thought of Agnes, his spotless lamb, exposed to lawless and licentious
                  pursuit, of whose nature and probabilities his past life gave him only too clear
                  an idea, was of itself a very natural source of anxiety. But Elsie had unveiled to
                  him her plans for her marriage, and consulted him on the propriety of placing
                  Agnes immediately under the protection of the husband she had chosen for her; and
                  it was this part of her communication which had awakened the severest internal
                  recoil, and raised a tumult of passions which the priest vainly sought either to
                  assuage or understand.</p>
               <p>As soon as his morning duties were over, he repaired to his convent, sought his
                  cell, and, prostrate on his face before the crucifix, began his internal reckoning
                  with himself. The day passed in fasting and solitude.</p>
               <p>It is now golden evening, and on the square, flat roof of the convent, which,
                  high-perched on a crag, overlooks the bay, one might observe a dark figure slowly
                  pacing backward and forward. It is Father Francesco; and as he walks up and down,
                  one could see by his large, bright, dilated eye, by the vivid red spot on either
                  sunken cheek, and by the nervous energy of his movements, that he is in the very
                  height of some mental crisis,—in that state of placid <foreign xml:lang="GRC"
                     >extase</foreign> in which the subject supposes himself perfectly calm, because
                  every nerve is screwed to the highest point of tension and can vibrate no
                  more.</p>
               <p>What oceans had that day rolled over him and swept him, as one may see a little
                  boat rocked on the capricious surges of the Mediterranean! Were, then, all his
                  strivings and agonies in vain? Did he love this woman with any earthly love? Was
                  he jealous of the thought of a future husband? Was it a tempting demon that said
                  to him, "Lorenzo Sforza might have shielded this treasure from the profanation of
                  lawless violence, from the brute grasp of an inappreciative peasant, but Father
                  Francesco cannot"? There was a moment when his whole being vibrated with a
                  perception of what a marriage bond might have been that was indeed a sacrament,
                  and that bound together two pure and loyal souls who gave life and courage to each
                  other in all holy purposes and heroic deeds; and he almost feared that he had
                  cursed his vows,—those awful vows, at whose remembrance his inmost soul shivered
                  through every nerve.</p>
               <p>But after hours of prayer and struggle, and wave after wave of agonizing
                  convulsion, he gained one of those high points in human possibility where souls
                  can stand a little while at a time, and where all things seem so transfigured and
                  pure that they fancy themselves thenceforward forever victorious over evil.</p>
               <p>As he walks up and down in the gold-and-purple evening twilight, his mind seems to
                  him calm as that glowing sea that reflects the purple shores of Ischia, and the
                  quaint, fantastic grottos and cliffs of Capri. All is golden and glowing; he sees
                  all clear; he is delivered from his spiritual enemies; he treads them under his
                  feet.</p>
               <p>Yes, he says to himself, he loves Agnes,—loves her all-sacredly as her guardian
                  angel does, who ever beholdeth the face of her Father in Heaven. Why, then, does
                  he shrink from her marriage? Is it not evident? Has that tender soul, that poetic
                  nature, that aspiring genius, anything in common with the vulgar, coarse details
                  of a peasant's life? Will not her beauty always draw the eye of the licentious,
                  expose her artless innocence to solicitation which will annoy her and bring upon
                  her head the<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7945-00000026"/> inconsiderate jealousy of
                  her husband? Think of Agnes made subject to the rude authority, to the stripes and
                  correction, which men of the lower class, under the promptings of jealousy, do not
                  scruple to inflict on their wives! What career did society, as then organized,
                  present to such a nature, so perilously gifted in body and mind? He has the
                  answer. The Church has opened a career to woman which all the world denies
                  her.</p>
               <p>He remembers the story of the dyer's daughter of Siena, the fair Saint Catharine.
                  In his youth he had often visited the convent where one of the first artists of
                  Italy has immortalized her conflicts and her victories, and knelt with his mother
                  at the altar where she now communes with the faithful. He remembered how, by her
                  sanctity, her humility, and her holy inspirations of soul, she had risen to the
                  courts of princes, whither she had been sent as ambassadress to arrange for the
                  interests of the Church; and then rose before his mind's eye the gorgeous picture
                  of Pinturicchio, where, borne in celestial repose and purity amid all the powers
                  and dignitaries of the Church, she is canonized as one of those that shall reign
                  and intercede with Christ in heaven.</p>
               <p>Was it wrong, therefore, in him, though severed from all womankind by a gulf of
                  irrevocable vows, that he should feel a kind of jealous property in this gifted
                  and beautiful creature? and though he might not, even in thought, dream of
                  possessing her himself, was there sin in the vehement energy with which his whole
                  nature rose up in him to say that no other man should,—that she should be the
                  bride of Heaven alone?</p>
               <p>Certainly, if there were, it lurked far out of sight; and the priest had a case
                  that might have satisfied a conscience even more fastidious;—and he felt a sort of
                  triumph in the results of his mental scrutiny.</p>
               <p>Yes, she should ascend from glory to glory,—but <emph>his</emph> should be the
                  hand that should lead her upward. <emph>He</emph> would lead her within the
                  consecrated grate,—<emph>he</emph> would pronounce the awful words that should
                  make it sacrilege for all other men to approach her; and yet through life
                     <emph>he</emph> should be the guardian and director of her soul, the one being
                  to whom she should render an obedience as unlimited as that which belongs to
                  Christ alone.</p>
               <p>Such were the thoughts of this victorious hour,—which, alas! were destined to fade
                  as those purple skies and golden fires gradually went out, leaving, in place of
                  their light and glory, only the lurid glow of Vesuvius.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE WALK TO THE CONVENT.</head>
               <p>ELSIE returned from the confessional a little after sunrise, much relieved and
                  satisfied. Padre Francesco had shown such a deep interest in her narrative that
                  she was highly gratified. Then he had given her advice which exactly accorded with
                  her own views; and such advice is always regarded as an eminent proof of sagacity
                  in the giver.</p>
               <p>On the point of the marriage he had recommended delay,—a course quite in
                  accordance with Elsie's desire, who, curiously enough, ever since her treaty of
                  marriage with Antonio had been commenced, had cherished the most whimsical,
                  jealous dislike of him, as if he were about to get away her grandchild from her;
                  and this rose at times so high that she could scarcely speak peaceably to him,—a
                  course of things which caused Antonio to open wide his great soft ox-eyes, and
                  wonder at the ways of woman-kind; but he waited the event in philosophic
                  tranquillity.</p>
               <p>The morning sunbeams were shooting many a golden shaft among the orange-trees when
                  Elsie returned and found Agnes yet kneeling at her prayers.</p>
               <p>"Now, my little heart," said the old woman, when their morning meal was done, "I
                  am going to give you a holiday to-day. I will go with you to the Convent, and you
                  shall spend the day with the sisters, and so carry Saint Agnes her ring."</p>
               <p>"Oh, thank you, grandmamma! how good you are! May I stop a little on the way, and
                  pick some cyclamen and myrtles and daisies for her shrine?"</p>
               <p>"Just as you like, child; but if you are going to do that, we must be off soon,
                  for I must be at my stand betimes to sell oranges: I had them all picked this
                  morning while my little darling was asleep."</p>
               <p>"You always do everything, grandmamma, and leave me nothing to do: it is not fair.
                  But, grandmamma, if we are going to get flowers by the way, let us follow down the
                  stream, through the gorge, out upon the sea-beach, and so walk along the sands,
                  and go by the back path up the rocks to the Convent: that walk is so shady and
                  lovely at this time in the morning, and it is so fresh along by the sea-side!"</p>
               <p>"As you please, dearie; but first fill a little basket with our best oranges for
                  the sisters."</p>
               <p>"Trust me for that!" And the girl ran eagerly to the house, and drew from her
                  treasures a little white wicker basket, which she proceeded to line curiously with
                  orange-leaves, sticking sprays of blossoms in a wreath round the border.</p>
               <p>"Now for some of our best blood-oranges!" she said;—"old Jocunda says they put her
                  in mind of pomegranates. And here are some of these little ones,—see here,
                  grandmamma!" she exclaimed, as she turned and held up a branch just broken, where
                  five small golden balls grew together with a pearly spray of white buds just
                  beyond them.</p>
               <p>The exercise of springing up for the branch had sent a vivid glow into her clear
                  brown cheek, and her eyes were dilated with excitement and pleasure; and as she
                  stood joyously<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7945-00000028"/> ously holding the branch,
                  while the flickering shadows fell on her beautiful face, she seemed more like a
                  painter's dream than a reality.</p>
               <p>Her grandmother stood a moment admiring her.</p>
               <p>"She's too good and too pretty for Antonio or any other man: she ought to be kept
                  to look at," she said to herself. "If I could keep her always, no man should have
                  her; but death will come, and youth and beauty go, and so somebody must care for
                  her."</p>
               <p>When the basket was filled and trimmed, Agnes took it on her arm. Elsie raised and
                  poised on her head the great square basket that contained her merchandise, and
                  began walking erect and straight down the narrow rocky stairs that led into the
                  gorge, holding her distaff with its white flax in her hands, and stepping as
                  easily as if she bore no burden.</p>
               <p>Agnes followed her with light, irregular movements, glancing aside from time to
                  time, as a tuft of flowers or a feathery spray of leaves attracted her fancy. In a
                  few moments her hands were too full, and her woollen apron of many-colored stripes
                  was raised over one arm to hold her treasures, while a hymn to Saint Agnes, which
                  she constantly murmured to herself, came in little ripples of sound, now from
                  behind a rock, and now out of a tuft of bushes, to show where the wanderer was
                  hid. The song, like many Italian ones, would be nothing in English,—only a musical
                  repetition of sweet words to a very simple and childlike idea, the <foreign
                     xml:lang="ITA">bella, bella, bella</foreign> ringing out in every verse with a
                  tender joyousness that seemed in harmony with the waving ferns and pendent flowers
                  and long ivy-wreaths from among which its notes issued. "Beautiful and sweet
                  Agnes," it said, in a thousand tender repetitions, "make me like thy little white
                  lamb! Beautiful Agnes, take me to the green fields where Christ's lambs are
                  feeding! Sweeter than the rose, fairer than the lily, take me where thou art!"</p>
               <p>At the bottom of the ravine a little stream tinkles its way among stones so mossy
                  in their deep, cool shadow as to appear all verdure; for seldom the light of the
                  sun can reach the darkness where they lie. A little bridge, hewn from solid rock,
                  throws across the shrunken stream an arch much wider than its waters seem to
                  demand; for in spring and autumn, when the torrents wash down from the mountains,
                  its volume is often suddenly increased.</p>
               <p>This bridge was so entirely and evenly grown over with short thick moss that it
                  might seem cut of some strange kind of living green velvet, and here and there it
                  was quaintly embroidered with small blossoming tufts of white alyssum, or feathers
                  of ferns and maiden's-hair which shook and trembled to every breeze. Nothing could
                  be lovelier than this mossy bridge, when some stray sunbeam, slanting up the
                  gorge, took a fancy to light it up with golden hues, and give transparent
                  greenness to the tremulous thin leaves that waved upon it.</p>
               <p>On this spot Elsie paused a moment, and called back after Agnes, who had
                  disappeared into one of those deep grottos with which the sides of the gorge are
                  perforated, and which are almost entirely veiled by the pendent ivy-wreaths.</p>
               <p>"Agnes! Agnes! wild girl! come quick!"</p>
               <p>Only the sound of "<foreign xml:lang="ITA">Bella, bella Agnella</foreign>" came
                  out of the ivy-leaves to answer her; but it sounded so happy and innocent that
                  Elsie could not forbear a smile, and in a moment Agnes came springing down with a
                  quantity of the feathery lycopodium in her hands, which grows nowhere so well as
                  in moist and dripping places.</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7945-00000029"/>
               <p>Out of her apron were hanging festoons of golden broom, crimson gladiolus, and
                  long, trailing sprays of ivy; while she held aloft in triumph a handful of the
                  most superb cyclamen, whose rosy crowns rise so beautifully above their dark
                  quaint leaves in moist and shady places.</p>
               <p>"See, see, grandmother, what an offering I have! Saint Agnes will be pleased with
                  me to-day; for I believe in her heart she loves flowers better than gems."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, wild one,—time flies, we must hurry." And crossing the bridge
                  quickly, the grandmother struck into a mossy foot-path that led them, after some
                  walking, under the old Roman bridge at the gateway of Sorrento. Two hundred feet
                  above their heads rose the mighty arches, enamelled with moss and feathered with
                  ferns all the way; and below this bridge the gorge grew somewhat wider, its sides
                  gradually receding and leaving a beautiful flat tract of land, which was laid out
                  as an orange-orchard. The golden fruit was shut in by rocky walls on either side
                  which here formed a perfect hot-bed, and no oranges were earlier or finer.</p>
               <p>Through this beautiful orchard the two at length emerged from the gorge upon the
                  sea-sands, where lay the blue Mediterranean swathed in bands of morning mist, its
                  many-colored waters shimmering with a thousand reflected lights, and old Capri
                  panting through sultry blue mists, and Vesuvius with his cloud-spotted sides and
                  smoke-wreathed top burst into view. At a little distance a boat-load of bronzed
                  fishermen had just drawn in a net, from which they were throwing out a quantity of
                  sardines, which flapped and fluttered in the sunshine like scales of silver. The
                  wind blowing freshly bore thousands of little purple waves to break one after
                  another at the foamy line which lay on the sand.</p>
               <p>Agnes ran gayly along the beach with her flowers and vines fluttering from her gay
                  striped apron, and her cheeks flushed with exercise and pleasure,—sometimes
                  stopping and turning with animation to her grandmother to point out the various
                  floral treasures that enamelled every crevice and rift of the steep wall of rock
                  which rose perpendicularly above their heads in that whole line of the shore which
                  is crowned with the old city of Sorrento: and surely never did rocky wall show to
                  the open sea a face more picturesque and flowery. The deep red cliff was hollowed
                  here and there into fanciful grottos, draped with every varied hue and form of
                  vegetable beauty. Here a crevice high in air was all abloom with purple
                  gillyflower, and depending in festoons above it the golden blossoms of the broom;
                  here a cleft seemed to be a nestling-place for a colony of gladiolus, with its
                  crimson flowers and blade-like leaves; here the silver-frosted foliage of the
                  miller-geranium, or of the wormwood, toned down the extravagant brightness of
                  other blooms by its cooler tints. In some places it seemed as if a sort of floral
                  cascade were tumbling confusedly over the rocks, mingling all hues and all forms
                  in a tangled mass of beauty.</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said old Elsie, as Agnes pointed to some superb gillyflowers which
                  grew nearly half-way up the precipice,—"is the child possessed? You have all the
                  gorge in your apron already. Stop looking, and let us hurry on."</p>
               <p>After a half-hour's walk, they came to a winding staircase cut in the rock, which
                  led them a zigzag course up through galleries and grottos looking out through
                  curious windows and loop-holes upon the sea, till finally they emerged at the old
                  sculptured portal of a shady garden which was surrounded by the cloistered arcades
                  of the Convent of Saint Agnes.</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7945-00000030"/>
               <p>The Convent of Saint Agnes was one of those monuments in which the piety of the
                  Middle Ages delighted to commemorate the triumphs of the new Christianity over the
                  old Heathenism.</p>
               <p>The balmy climate and paradisiacal charms of Sorrento and the adjacent shores of
                  Naples had made them favorite resorts during the latter period of the Roman
                  Empire,—a period when the whole civilized world seemed to human view about to be
                  dissolved in the corruption of universal sensuality. The shores of Baiæ were
                  witnesses of the orgies and cruelties of Nero and a court made in his likeness,
                  and the palpitating loveliness of Capri became the hot-bed of the unnatural vices
                  of Tiberius. The whole of Southern Italy was sunk in a debasement of animalism and
                  ferocity which seemed irrecoverable, and would have been so, had it not been for
                  the handful of salt which a Galilean peasant had about that time cast into the
                  putrid, fermenting mass of human society.</p>
               <p>We must not wonder at the zeal which caused the artistic Italian nature to love to
                  celebrate the passing away of an era of unnatural vice and demoniac cruelty by
                  visible images of the purity, the tenderness, the universal benevolence which
                  Jesus had brought into the world.</p>
               <p>Some time about the middle of the thirteenth century, it had been a favorite
                  enterprise of a princess of a royal family in Naples to erect a convent to Saint
                  Agnes, the guardian of female purity, out of the wrecks and remains of an ancient
                  temple of Venus, whose white pillars and graceful acanthus-leaves once crowned a
                  portion of the precipice on which the town was built, and were reflected from the
                  glassy blue of the sea at its feet. It was said that this princess was the first
                  lady abbess. Be that as it may, it proved to be a favorite retreat for many ladies
                  of rank and religious aspiration, whom ill-fortune in some of its varying forms
                  led to seek its quiet shades, and it was well and richly endowed by its royal
                  patrons.</p>
               <p>It was built after the manner of conventual buildings generally,—in a hollow
                  square, with a cloistered walk around the inside looking upon a garden.</p>
               <p>The portal at which Agnes and her grandmother knocked, after ascending the winding
                  staircase cut in the precipice, opened through an arched passage into this
                  garden.</p>
               <p>As the ponderous door swung open, it was pleasant to hear the lulling sound of a
                  fountain, which came forth with a gentle patter, like that of soft summer rain,
                  and to see the waving of rose-bushes and golden jessamines, and smell the perfumes
                  of orange-blossoms mingling with those of a thousand other flowers.</p>
               <p>The door was opened by an odd-looking portress. She might be seventy-five or
                  eighty; her cheeks were of the color of very yellow parchment drawn in dry
                  wrinkles; her eyes were those large, dark, lustrous ones so common in her country,
                  but seemed, in the general decay and shrinking of every other part of her face, to
                  have acquired a wild, unnatural appearance; while the falling away of her teeth
                  left nothing to impede the meeting of her hooked nose with her chin. Add to this,
                  she was hump-backed, and twisted in her figure; and one needs all the force of her
                  very good-natured, kindly smile to redeem the image of poor old Jocunda from
                  association with that of some Thracian witch, and cause one to see in her the
                  appropriate portress of a Christian institution.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, Agnes fell upon her neck and imprinted a very fervent kiss upon what
                  was left of her withered cheek,<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7945-00000031"/> and was
                  repaid by a shower of those epithets of endearment which in the language of Italy
                  fly thick and fast as the petals of the orange-blossom from her groves.</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said old Elsie,—"I'm going to leave her here to-day. You've no
                  objections, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"Bless the sweet lamb, no! She belongs here of good right. I believe blessed Saint
                  Agnes has adopted her; for I've seen her smile, plain as could be, when the little
                  one brought her flowers."</p>
               <p>"Well, Agnes," said the old woman, "I shall come for you after the Ave Maria."
                  Saying which, she lifted her basket and departed.</p>
               <p>The garden where the two were left was one of the most peaceful retreats that the
                  imagination of a poet could create.</p>
               <p>Around it ran on all sides the Byzantine arches of a cloistered walk, which,
                  according to the quaint, rich fashion of that style, had been painted with
                  vermilion, blue, and gold. The vaulted roof was spangled with gold stars on a blue
                  ground, and along the sides was a series of fresco pictures representing the
                  various scenes in the life of Saint Agnes; and as the foundress of the Convent was
                  royal in her means, there was no lack either of gold or gems or of gorgeous
                  painting.</p>
               <p>Full justice was done in the first picture to the princely wealth and estate of
                  the fair Agnes, who was represented as a pure-looking, pensive child, standing in
                  a thoughtful attitude, with long ripples of golden hair flowing down over a simple
                  white tunic, and her small hands clasping a cross on her bosom, while, kneeling at
                  her feet, obsequious slaves and tire-women were offering the richest gems and the
                  most gorgeous robes to her serious and abstracted gaze.</p>
               <p>In another, she was represented as walking modestly to school, and winning the
                  admiration of the son of the Roman Prætor, who fell sick—so says the legend—for
                  the love of her.</p>
               <p>Then there was the demand of her hand in marriage by the princely father of the
                  young man, and her calm rejection of the gorgeous gifts and splendid gems which he
                  had brought to purchase her consent.</p>
               <p>Then followed in order her accusation before the tribunals as a Christian, her
                  trial, and the various scenes of her martyrdom.</p>
               <p>Although the drawing of the figures and the treatment of the subjects had the
                  quaint stiffness of the thirteenth century, their general effect, as seen from the
                  shady bowers of the garden, was of a solemn brightness, a strange and fanciful
                  richness, which was poetical and impressive.</p>
               <p>In the centre of the garden was a fountain of white marble, which evidently was
                  the wreck of something that had belonged to the old Greek temple. The statue of a
                  nymph sat on a green mossy pedestal in the midst of a sculptured basin, and from a
                  partially reversed urn on which she was leaning a clear stream of water dashed
                  down from one mossy fragment to another, till it lost itself in the placid
                  pool.</p>
               <p>The figure and face of this nymph, in their classic finish of outline, formed a
                  striking contrast to the drawing of the Byzantine paintings within the cloisters,
                  and their juxtaposition in the same enclosure seemed a presentation of the spirit
                  of a past and present era: the past so graceful in line, so perfect and airy in
                  conception, so utterly without spiritual aspiration or life; the present limited
                  in artistic power, but so earnest, so intense, seeming to struggle and burn, amid
                     its<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7945-00000032"/> stiff and restricted boundaries,
                  for the expression of some diviner phase of humanity.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, the nymph of the fountain, different in style and execution as it
                  was, was so fair a creature, that it was thought best, after the spirit of those
                  days, to purge her from all heathen and improper histories by baptizing her in the
                  waters of her own fountain, and bestowing on her the name of the saint to whose
                  convent she was devoted. The simple sisterhood, little conversant in nice points
                  of antiquity, regarded her as Saint Agnes dispensing the waters of purity to her
                  convent; and marvellous and sacred properties were ascribed to the water, when
                  taken fasting with a sufficient number of prayers and other religious exercises.
                  All around the neighborhood of this fountain the ground was one bed of blue and
                  white violets, whose fragrance filled the air, and which were deemed by the nuns
                  to have come up there in especial token of the favor with which Saint Agnes
                  regarded the conversion of this heathen relic to pious and Christian uses.</p>
               <p>This nymph had been an especial favorite of the childhood of Agnes, and she had
                  always had a pleasure which she could not exactly account for in gazing upon it.
                  It is seldom that one sees in the antique conception of the immortals any trace of
                  human feeling. Passionless perfection and repose seem to be their uniform
                  character. But now and then from the ruins of Southern Italy fragments have been
                  dug, not only pure in outline, but invested with a strange pathetic charm, as if
                  the calm, inviolable circle of divinity had been touched by some sorrowing sense
                  of that unexplained anguish with which the whole lower creation groans. One sees
                  this mystery of expression in the face of that strange and beautiful Psyche which
                  still enchants the Museum of Naples. Something of this charm of mournful pathos
                  lingered on the beautiful features of this nymph,—an expression so delicate and
                  shadowy that it seemed to address itself only to finer natures. It was as if all
                  the silent, patient woe and discouragement of a dumb antiquity had been congealed
                  into this memorial. Agnes was often conscious, when a child, of being saddened by
                  it, and yet drawn towards it with a mysterious attraction.</p>
               <p>About this fountain, under the shadow of bending rose-trees and yellow jessamines,
                  was a circle of garden-seats, adopted also from the ruins of the past. Here a
                  graceful Corinthian capital, with every white acanthus-leaf perfect, stood in a
                  mat of acanthus-leaves of Nature's own making, glossy green and sharply cut; and
                  there was a long portion of a frieze sculptured with graceful dancing figures; and
                  in another place a fragment of a fluted column, with lycopodium and colosseum vine
                  hanging from its fissures in graceful draping. On these seats Agnes had dreamed
                  away many a tranquil hour, making garlands of violets, and listening to the
                  marvellous legends of old Jocunda.</p>
               <p>In order to understand anything of the true idea of conventual life in those days,
                  we must consider that books were as yet unknown, except as literary rarities, and
                  reading and writing were among the rare accomplishments of the higher classes; and
                  that Italy, from the time that the great Roman Empire fell and broke into a
                  thousand shivers, had been subject to a continual series of conflicts and
                  struggles, which took from life all security. Norman, Dane, Sicilian, Spaniard,
                  Frenchman, and German mingled and struggled, now up and now down; and every
                  struggle was attended by the little ceremonies of sacking towns, burning villages,
                  and routing out entire populations to utter misery and wretchedness<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000033"/> ness. During these tumultuous ages, those buildings
                  consecrated by a religion recognized alike by all parties afforded to misfortune
                  the only inviolable asylum, and to feeble and discouraged spirits the only home
                  safe from the prospect of reverses.</p>
               <p>If the destiny of woman is a problem that calls for grave attention even in our
                  enlightened times, and if she is too often a sufferer from the inevitable
                  movements of society, what must have been her position and needs in those ruder
                  ages, unless the genius of Christianity had opened refuges for her weakness, made
                  inviolable by the awful sanctions of religion?</p>
               <p>What could they do, all these girls and women together, with the twenty-four long
                  hours of every day, without reading or writing, and without the care of children?
                  Enough: with their multiplied diurnal prayer periods, with each its chants and
                  ritual of observances,—with the preparation for meals, and the clearing away
                  thereafter,—with the care of the chapel, shrine, sacred gifts, drapery, and
                  ornaments,—with embroidering altar-cloths and making sacred tapers,—with preparing
                  conserves of rose-leaves and curious spiceries,—with mixing drugs for the
                  sick,—with all those mutual offices and services to each other which their
                  relations in one family gave rise to,—and with divers feminine gossipries and
                  harmless chatterings and cooings, one can conceive that these dove-cots of the
                  Church presented often some of the most tranquil scenes of those convulsive and
                  disturbed periods.</p>
               <p>Human nature probably had its varieties there as other-where. There were there the
                  domineering and the weak, the ignorant and the vulgar, and the patrician and the
                  princess, and though professedly all brought on the footing of sisterly equality,
                  we are not to suppose any Utopian degree of perfection among them. The way of pure
                  spirituality was probably, in the convent as well as out, that strait and narrow
                  one which there be few to find. There, as elsewhere, the devotee who sought to
                  progress faster toward heaven than suited the paces of her fellow-travellers was
                  reckoned a troublesome enthusiast, till she got far enough in advance to be
                  worshipped as a saint.</p>
               <p>Sister Theresa, the abbess of this convent, was the youngest daughter in a
                  princely Neapolitan family, who from her cradle had been destined to the cloister,
                  in order that her brother and sister might inherit more splendid fortunes and form
                  more splendid connections. She had been sent to this place too early to have much
                  recollection of any other mode of life; and when the time came to take the
                  irrevocable step, she renounced with composure a world she had never known.</p>
               <p>Her brother had endowed her with a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">livre des
                     heures</foreign>, illuminated with all the wealth of blue and gold and divers
                  colors which the art of those times afforded,—a work executed by a pupil of the
                  celebrated Frà Angelico; and the possession of this treasure was regarded by her
                  as a far richer inheritance than that princely state of which she knew nothing.
                  Her neat little cell had a window that looked down on the sea,—on Capri, with its
                  fantastic grottos,—on Vesuvius, with its weird daily and nightly changes. The
                  light that came in from the joint reflection of sea and sky gave a golden and
                  picturesque coloring to the simple and bare furniture, and in sunny weather she
                  often sat there, just as a lizard lies upon a wall, with the simple, warm,
                  delightful sense of living and being amid scenes of so much beauty. Of the life
                  that people lived in the outer world, the struggle<pb n="66-67"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000034"/> gle, the hope, the fear, the vivid joy, the bitter
                  sorrow, Sister Theresa knew nothing. She could form no judgment and give no advice
                  founded on any such experience.</p>
               <p>The only life she knew was a certain ideal one, drawn from the legends of the
                  saints; and her piety was a calm, pure enthusiasm which had never been disturbed
                  by a temptation or a struggle. Her rule in the Convent was even and serene; but
                  those who came to her flock from the real world, from the trials and temptations
                  of a real experience, were always enigmas to her, and she could scarcely
                  comprehend or aid them.</p>
               <p>In fact, since in the cloister, as everywhere else, character will find its level,
                  it was old Jocunda who was the real governess of the Convent. Jocunda was
                  originally a peasant woman, whose husband had been drafted to some of the wars of
                  his betters, and she had followed his fortunes in the camp. In the sack of a
                  fortress, she lost her husband and four sons, all the children she had, and
                  herself received an injury which distorted her form, and so she took refuge in the
                  Convent. Here her energy and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">savoir-faire</foreign>
                  rendered her indispensable in every department. She made the bargains, bought the
                  provisions, (being allowed to sally forth for these purposes,) and formed the
                  medium by which the timid, abstract, defenceless nuns accomplished those material
                  relations with the world with which the utmost saintliness cannot afford to
                  dispense. Besides and above all this, Jocunda's wide experience and endless
                  capabilities of narrative made her an invaluable resource for enlivening any dull
                  hours that might be upon the hands of the sisterhood; and all these
                  recommendations, together with a strong mother-wit and native sense, soon made her
                  so much the leading spirit in the Convent vent that Mother Theresa herself might
                  be said to be under her dominion.</p>
               <p>"So, so," she said to Agnes, when she had closed the gate after Elsie,—"you never
                  come empty-handed. What lovely oranges!—worth double any that one can buy of
                  anybody else but your grandmother."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and these flowers I brought to dress the altar."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes! Saint Agnes has given you a particular grace for that," said
                  Jocunda.</p>
               <p>"And I have brought a ring for her treasury," said Agnes, taking out the gift of
                  the Cavalier.</p>
               <p>"Holy Mother! here is something, to be sure!" said Jocunda, catching it eagerly.
                  "Why, Agnes, this is a diamond,—and as pretty a one as ever I saw. How it shines!"
                  she added, holding it up. "That's a prince's present. How did you get it?"</p>
               <p>"I want to tell our mother about it," said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"You do?" said Jocunda. "You'd better tell me. I know fifty times as much about
                  such things as she."</p>
               <p>"Dear Jocunda, I will tell you, too; but I love Mother Theresa, and I ought to
                  give it to her first."</p>
               <p>"As you please, then," said Jocunda. "Well, put your flowers here by the fountain,
                  where the spray will keep them cool, and we will go to her."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE DAY AT THE CONVENT.</head>
               <p>THE Mother Theresa sat in a sort of withdrawing-room, the roof of which rose in
                  arches, starred with blue and gold like that of the cloister, and the sides were
                  frescoed with scenes from the life of the Virgin. Over every door, and in
                  convenient places between the paintings, texts of Holy Writ were illuminated in
                  blue and scarlet and gold, with a richness and fancifulness of outline, as if
                  every sacred letter had blossomed into a mystical flower. The Abbess herself, with
                  two of her nuns, was busily embroidering a new altar-cloth, with a lavish
                  profusion of adornment; and, from time to time, their voices rose in the musical
                  tones of an ancient Latin hymn. The words were full of that quaint and mystical
                  pietism with which the fashion of the times clothed the expression of devotional
                  feeling:— <q>

                     </lg>
                  </note>This little canticle was, in truth, very different from the hymns to Venus
                  which used to resound in the temple which the convent had displaced. The voices
                  which sung were of a deep, plaintive contralto, much resembling the richness of a
                  tenor, and as they moved in modulated waves of chanting sound the effect was
                  soothing and dreamy. Agnes stopped at the door to listen.</p>
               <p>"Stop, dear Jocunda," she said to the old woman, who was about to push her way
                  abruptly into the room, "wait till it is over."</p>
               <p>Jocunda, who was quite matter-of-fact in her ideas of religion, made a little
                  movement of impatience, but was recalled to herself by observing the devout
                  absorption with which Agnes, with clasped hands and downcast head, was mentally
                  joining in the hymn with a solemn brightness in her young face.</p>
               <p>"If she hasn't got a vocation, nobody ever had one," said Jocunda, mentally.
                  "Deary me, I wish I had more of one myself!"</p>
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7945-00000036"/>
               <p>When the strain died away, and was succeeded by a conversation on the respective
                  merits of two kinds of gold embroidering-thread, Agnes and Jocunda entered the
                  apartment. Agnes went forward and kissed the hand of the Mother reverentially.</p>
               <p>Sister Theresa we have before described as tall, pale, and sad-eyed,—a moonlight
                  style of person, wanting in all those elements of warm color and physical solidity
                  which give the impression of a real vital human existence. The strongest affection
                  she had ever known had been that which had been excited by the childish beauty and
                  graces of Agnes, and she folded her in her arms and kissed her forehead with a
                  warmth that had in it the semblance of maternity.</p>
               <p>"Grandmamma has given me a day to spend with you, dear mother," said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"Welcome, dear little child!" said Mother Theresa. "Your spiritual home always
                  stands open to you."</p>
               <p>"I have something to speak to you of in particular, my mother," said Agnes,
                  blushing deeply.</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" said the Mother Theresa, a slight movement of curiosity arising in her
                  mind as she signed to the two nuns to leave the apartment.</p>
               <p>"My mother," said Agnes, "yesterday evening, as grandmamma and I were sitting at
                  the gate, selling oranges, a young cavalier came up and bought oranges of me, and
                  he kissed my forehead and asked me to pray for him, and gave me this ring for the
                  shrine of Saint Agnes."</p>
               <p>"Kissed your forehead!" said Jocunda, "here's a pretty go! it is n't like you,
                  Agnes, to let him."</p>
               <p>"He did it before I knew," said Agnes. "Grandmamma reproved him, and then he
                  seemed to repent, and gave this ring for the shrine of Saint Agnes."</p>
               <p>"And a pretty one it is, too," said Jocunda. "We have n't a prettier in all our
                  treasury. Not even the great emerald the Queen gave is better in its way than
                  this."</p>
               <p>"And he asked you to pray for him?" said Mother Theresa.</p>
               <p>"Yes, mother dear; he looked right into my eyes and made me look into his, and
                  made me promise;—and I knew that holy virgins never refused their prayers to any
                  one that asked, and so I followed their example."</p>
               <p>"I'll warrant me he was only mocking at you for a poor little fool," said Jocunda;
                  "the gallants of our day don't believe much in prayers."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps so, Jocunda," said Agnes, gravely; "but if that be the case, he needs
                  prayers all the more."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Mother Theresa. "Remember the story of the blessed Saint Dorothea,—how
                  a wicked young nobleman mocked at her, when she was going to execution, and said,
                  'Dorothea, Dorothea, I will believe, when you shall send me down some of the
                  fruits and flowers of Paradise;' and she, full of faith, said, 'To-day I will send
                  them;' and, wonderful to tell, that very day, at evening, an angel came to the
                  young man with a basket of citrons and roses, and said, 'Dorothea sends thee
                  these, wherefore believe.' See what grace a pure maiden can bring to a thoughtless
                  young man,—for this young man was converted and became a champion of the
                  faith."</p>
               <p>"That was in the old times," said Jocunda, sceptically. "I don't believe setting
                  the lamb to pray for the wolf will do much in our day. Prithee, child, what manner
                  of man was this gallant?"</p>
               <p>"He was beautiful as an angel," said Agnes, "only it was not a good beauty. He
                  looked proud and sad, both,—like<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7945-00000037"/> one who
                  is not at ease in his heart. Indeed, I feel very sorry for him; his eyes made a
                  kind of trouble in my mind, that reminds me to pray for him often."</p>
               <p>"And I will join my prayers to yours, dear daughter," said the Mother Theresa; "I
                  long to have you with us, that we may pray together every day;—say, do you think
                  your grandmamma will spare you to us wholly before long?"</p>
               <p>"Grandmamma will not hear of it yet," said Agnes; "and she loves me so, it would
                  break her heart, if I should leave her, and she could not be happy here;—but,
                  mother, you have told me we could carry an altar always in our hearts, and adore
                  in secret. When it is God's will I should come to you, He will incline her
                  heart."</p>
               <p>"Between you and me, little one," said Jocunda, "I think there will soon be a
                  third person who will have something to say in the case."</p>
               <p>"Whom do you mean?" said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"A husband," said Jocunda; "I suppose your grandmother has one picked out for you.
                  You are neither hump-backed nor cross-eyed, that you should n't have one as well
                  as other girls."</p>
               <p>"I don't want one, Jocunda; and I have promised to Saint Agnes to come here, if
                  she will only get grandmother to consent."</p>
               <p>"Bless you, my daughter!" said Mother Theresa; "only persevere and the way will be
                  opened."</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said Jocunda, "we'll see. Come, little one, if you would n't have
                  your flowers wilt, we must go back and look after them."</p>
               <p>Reverently kissing the hand of the Abbess, Agnes withdrew with her old friend, and
                  crossed again to the garden to attend to her flowers.</p>
               <p>"Well now, childie," said Jocunda, "you can sit here and weave your garlands,
                  while I go and look after the conserves of raisins and citrons that Sister
                  Cattarina is making. She is stupid at anything but her prayers, is Cattarina. Our
                  Lady be gracious to me! I think I got my vocation from Saint Martha, and if it
                  wasn't for me, I don't know what would become of things in the Convent. Why, since
                  I came here, our conserves, done up in fig-leaf packages, have had quite a run at
                  Court, and our gracious Queen herself was good enough to send an order for a
                  hundred of them last week. I could have laughed to see how puzzled the Mother
                  Theresa looked;—much she knows about conserves! I suppose she thinks Gabriel
                  brings them straight down from Paradise, done up in leaves of the tree of life.
                  Old Jocunda knows what goes to their making up; she's good for something, if she
                  is old and twisted; many a scrubby old olive bears fat berries," said the old
                  portress, chuckling.</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear Jocunda," said Agnes, "why must you go this minute? I want to talk with
                  you about so many things!"</p>
               <p>"Bless the sweet child! it does want its old Jocunda, does it?" said the old
                  woman, in the tone with which one caresses a baby. "Well, well, it should then!
                  Just wait a minute, till I go and see that our holy Saint Cattarina has n't fallen
                  a-praying over the conserving-pan. I'll be back in a moment."</p>
               <p>So saying, she hobbled off briskly, and Agnes, sitting down on the fragment
                  sculptured with dancing nymphs, began abstractedly pulling her flowers towards
                  her, shaking from them the dew of the fountain.</p>
               <p>Unconsciously to herself, as she sat there, her head drooped into the attitude of
                  the marble nymph, and her<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7945-00000038"/> sweet features
                  assumed the same expression of plaintive and dreamy thoughtfulness; her heavy dark
                  lashes lay on her pure waxen cheeks like the dark fringe of some tropical flower.
                  Her form, in its drooping outlines, scarcely yet showed the full development of
                  womanhood, which after-years might unfold into the ripe fulness of her
                  country-women. Her whole attitude and manner were those of an exquisitely
                  sensitive and highly organized being, just struggling into the life of some
                  mysterious new inner birth,—into the sense of powers of feeling and being hitherto
                  unknown even to herself.</p>
               <p>"Ah," she softly sighed to herself, "how little I am! how little I can do! Could I
                  convert one soul! Ah, holy Dorothea, send down the roses of heaven into his soul,
                  that he also may believe!"</p>
               <p>"Well, my little beauty, you have not finished even one garland," said the voice
                  of old Jocunda, bustling up behind her. "Praise to Saint Martha, the conserves are
                  doing well, and so I catch a minute for my little heart."</p>
               <p>So saying, she sat down with her spindle and flax by Agnes, for an afternoon
                  gossip.</p>
               <p>"Dear Jocunda, I have heard you tell stories about spirits that haunt lonesome
                  places. Did you ever hear about any in the gorge?"</p>
               <p>"Why, bless the child, yes,—spirits are always pacing up and down in lonely
                  places. Father Anselmo told me that; and he had seen a priest once that had seen
                  that in the Holy Scriptures themselves,—so it must be true."</p>
               <p>"Well, did you ever hear of their making the most beautiful music?"</p>
               <p>"Have n't I?" said Jocunda,—"to be sure I have,—singing enough to draw the very
                  heart out of your body,— it's an old trick they have. Why I want to know if you
                  never heard about the King of Amalfi's son coming home from fighting for the Holy
                  Sepulchre? Why, there's rocks not far out from this very town where the Sirens
                  live; and if the King's son had n't had a holy bishop on board, who slept every
                  night with a piece of the true cross under his pillow, the green ladies <choice>
                     <sic>wonld</sic>
                     <corr>would</corr>
                  </choice> have sung him straight into perdition. They are very fair-spoken at
                  first, and sing so that a man gets perfectly drunk with their music, and longs to
                  fly to them; but they suck him down at last under water, and strangle him, and
                  that's the end of him."</p>
               <p>"You never told me about this before, Jocunda."</p>
               <p>"Have n't I, child? Well, I will now. You see, this good bishop, he dreamed three
                  times that they would sail past these rocks, and he was told to give all the
                  sailors holy wax from an altar-candle to stop their ears, so that they should n't
                  hear the music. Well, the King's son said he wanted to hear the music, so he would
                  n't have his ears stopped; but he told 'em to tie him to the mast, so that he
                  could hear it, but not to mind a word he said, if he begged 'em ever so hard to
                  untie him.</p>
               <p>"Well, you see they did it; and the old bishop, he had his ears sealed up tight,
                  and so did all the men; but the young man stood tied to the mast, and when they
                  sailed past he was like a demented creature. He called out that it was his lady
                  who was singing, and he wanted to go to her,—and his mother, who they all knew was
                  a blessed saint in paradise years before; and he commanded them to untie him, and
                  pulled and strained on his cords to get free; but they only tied him the tighter,
                  and so they got him past,—for, thanks to the holy wax, the sailors never heard a
                  word, and so they kept their senses. So they all got safe home;<pb n="76-77"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000039"/> but the young prince was so sick and pining that he
                  had to be exorcised and prayed for seven times seven days before they could get
                  the music out of his head."</p>
               <p>"Why," said Agnes, "do those Sirens sing there yet?"</p>
               <p>"Well, that was a hundred years ago. They say the old bishop, he prayed 'em down;
                  for he went out a little after on purpose, and gave 'em a precious lot of holy
                  water; most likely he got 'em pretty well under, though my husband's brother says
                  he's heard 'em singing in a small way, like frogs in spring-time; but he gave 'em
                  a pretty wide berth. You see, these spirits are what's left of old heathen times,
                  when, Lord bless us! the earth was just as full of 'em as a bit of old cheese is
                  of mites. Now a Christian body, if they take reasonable care, can walk quit of
                  'em; and if they have any haunts in lonesome and doleful places, if one puts up a
                  cross or a shrine, they know they have to go."</p>
               <p>"I am thinking," said Agnes, "it would be a blessed work to put up some shrines to
                  Saint Agnes and our good Lord in the gorge, and I'll promise to keep the lamps
                  burning and the flowers in order."</p>
               <p>"Bless the child!" said Jocunda, "that is a pious and Christian thought."</p>
               <p>"I have an uncle in Florence who is a father in the holy convent of San Marco, who
                  paints and works in stone,—not for money, but for the glory of God; and when he
                  comes this way I will speak to him about it," said Agnes. "About this time in the
                  spring he always visits us."</p>
               <p>"That's mighty well thought of," said Jocunda. "And now, tell me, little lamb,
                  have you any idea who this grand cavalier may be that gave you the ring?"</p>
               <p>"No," said Agnes, pausing a moment over the garland of flowers she was
                  weaving,—"only Giulietta told me that he was brother to the King. Giulietta said
                  everybody knew him."</p>
               <p>"I'm not so sure of that," said Jocunda. "Giulietta always thinks she knows more
                  than she does."</p>
               <p>"Whatever he may be, his worldly state is nothing to me," said Agnes. "I know him
                  only in my prayers."</p>
               <p>"Ay, ay," muttered the old woman to herself, looking obliquely out of the corner
                  of her eye at the girl, who was busily sorting her flowers; "perhaps he will be
                  seeking some other acquaintance."</p>
               <p>"You have n't seen him since?" said Jocunda.</p>
               <p>"Seen him? Why, dear Jocunda, it was only last evening"——</p>
               <p>"True enough. Well, child, don't think too much of him. Men are dreadful
                  creatures,—in these times especially; they snap up a pretty girl as a fox does a
                  chicken, and no questions asked."</p>
               <p>"I don't think he looked wicked, Jocunda; he had a proud sorrowful look. I don't
                  know what could make a rich, handsome young man sorrowful; but I feel in my heart
                  that he is not happy. Mother Theresa says that those who can do nothing but pray
                  may convert princes without knowing it."</p>
               <p>"Maybe it is so," said Jocunda, in the same tone in which thrifty professors of
                  religion often assent to the same sort of truths in our days. "I've seen a good
                  deal of that sort of cattle in my day; and one would think, by their actions, that
                  praying souls must be scarce where they came from."</p>
               <p>Agnes abstractedly stooped and began plucking handfuls of lycopodium, which was
                  growing green and feathery on one side of the marble frieze on which she was
                  sitting; in so doing, a fragment of white marble, which had been overgrown<pb
                     n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7945-00000040"/> grown in the luxuriant green, appeared to
                  view. It was that frequent object in the Italian soil,—a portion of an old Roman
                  tombstone. Agnes bent over, intent on the mystic "<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Dîs
                     Manibus</foreign>," in old Roman letters.</p>
               <p>"Lord bless the child! I've seen thousands of them," said Jocunda; "it's some old
                  heathen's grave, that's been in hell these hundred years."</p>
               <p>"In hell?" said Agnes, with a distressful accent.</p>
               <p>"Of course," said Jocunda. "Where should they be? Serves 'em right, too; they were
                  a vile old set."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Jocunda, it's dreadful to think of, that they should have been in hell all
                  this time."</p>
               <p>"And no nearer the end than when they began," said Jocunda.</p>
               <p>Agnes gave a shivering sigh, and, looking up into the golden sky that was pouring
                  such floods of splendor through the orange-trees and jasmines, thought, How could
                  it be that the world could possibly be going on so sweet and fair over such an
                  abyss?</p>
               <p>"Oh, Jocunda!" she said, "it does seem <emph>too</emph> dreadful to believe! How
                  could they help being heathen,—being born so,—and never hearing of the true
                  Church?"</p>
               <p>"Sure enough," said Jocunda, spinning away energetically, "but that's no business
                  of mine; my business is to save <emph>my</emph> soul, and that's what I came here
                  for. The dear saints know I found it dull enough at first, for I'd been used to
                  jaunting round with my old man and the boys; but what with marketing and
                  preserving, and one thing and another, I get on better now, praise to Saint
                  Agnes!"</p>
               <p>The large, dark eyes of Agnes were fixed abstractedly on the old woman as she
                  spoke, slowly dilating, with a sad, mysterious expression, which sometimes came
                  over them.</p>
               <p>"Ah! how can the saints themselves be happy?" she said. "One might be willing to
                  wear sackcloth and sleep on the ground, one might suffer ever so many years and
                  years, if only one might save some of them."</p>
               <p>"Well, it does seem hard," said Jocunda; "but what's the use of thinking of it?
                  Old Father Anselmo told us in one of his sermons that the Lord wills that his
                  saints should come to rejoice in the punishment of all heathens and heretics; and
                  he told us about a great saint once, who took it into his head to be distressed
                  because one of the old heathen whose books he was fond of reading had gone to
                  hell,—and he fasted and prayed, and would n't take no for an answer, till he got
                  him out."</p>
               <p>"He did, then?" said Agnes, clasping her hands in an ecstasy.</p>
               <p>"Yes; but the good Lord told him never to try it again,—and He struck him dumb, as
                  a kind of hint, you know. Why, Father Anselmo said that even getting souls out of
                  purgatory was no easy matter. He told us of one holy nun who spent nine years
                  fasting and praying for the soul of her prince, who was killed in a duel, and then
                  she saw in a vision that he was only raised the least little bit out of the
                  fire,—and she offered up her life as a sacrifice to the Lord to deliver him, but,
                  after all, when she died he was n't quite delivered. Such things made me think
                  that a poor old sinner like me would never get out at all, if I did n't set about
                  it in earnest,—though it a'n't all nuns that save their souls either. I remember
                  in Pisa I saw a great picture of the Judgment-Day in the Campo Santo, and there
                  were lots of abbesses, and nuns, and monks, and bishops too, that the devils were
                  clearing off into the fire."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Jocunda, how dreadful that fire must be!"</p>
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7945-00000041"/>
               <p>"Yes," said Jocunda. "Father Anselmo said hell-fire was n't like any kind of fire
                  we have here,—made to warm us and cook our food,—but a kind made especially to
                  torment body and soul, and not made for anything else. I remember a story he told
                  us about that. You see, there was an old duchess that lived in a grand old
                  castle,—and a proud, wicked old thing enough; and her son brought home a handsome
                  young bride to the castle, and the old duchess was jealous of her,—'cause, you
                  see, she hated to give up her place in the house, and the old family-jewels, and
                  all the splendid things,—and so one time, when the poor young thing was all
                  dressed up in a set of the old family-lace, what does the old hag do but set fire
                  to it!"</p>
               <p>"How horrible!" said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"Yes; and when the young thing ran screaming in her agony, the old hag stopped her
                  and tore off a pearl rosary that she was wearing, for fear it should be spoiled by
                  the fire."</p>
               <p>"Holy Mother! can such things be possible?" said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"Well, you see, she got her pay for it. That rosary was of famous old pearls that
                  had been in the family a hundred years; but from that moment the good Lord struck
                  it with a curse, and filled it white-hot with hell-fire, so that, if anybody held
                  it a few minutes in their hand, it would burn to the bone. The old sinner made
                  believe that she was in great affliction for the death of her daughter-in-law, and
                  that it was all an accident, and the poor young man went raving mad,—but that
                  awful rosary the old hag could n't get rid of. She could n't give it away,—she
                  could n't sell it,—but back it would come every night, and lie right over her
                  heart, all white-hot with the fire that burned in it. She gave it to a convent,
                  and she sold it to a merchant, but back it came; and she locked it up in the
                  heaviest chests, and she buried it down in the lowest vaults, but it always came
                  back in the night, till she was worn to a skeleton; and at last the old thing died
                  without confession or sacrament, and went where she belonged. She was found lying
                  dead in her bed one morning, and the rosary was gone; but when they came to lay
                  her out, they found the marks of it burned to the bone into her breast. Father
                  Anselmo used to tell us this, to show us a little what hell-fire was like."</p>
               <p>"Oh, please, Jocunda, don't let us talk about it any more," said Agnes.</p>
               <p>Old Jocunda, with her tough, vigorous organization and unceremonious habits of
                  expression, could not conceive the exquisite pain with which this whole
                  conversation had vibrated on the sensitive being at her right hand,—that what
                  merely awoke her hard-corded nerves to a dull vibration of not unpleasant
                  excitement was shivering and tearing the tenderer chords of poor little Psyche
                  beside her.</p>
               <p>Ages before, beneath those very skies that smiled so sweetly over her,—amid the
                  bloom of lemon and citron, and the perfume of jasmine and rose, the gentlest of
                  old Italian souls had dreamed and wondered what might be the unknown future of the
                  dead, and, learning his lesson from the glorious skies and gorgeous shores which
                  witnessed how magnificent a Being had given existence to man, had recorded his
                  hopes of man's future in the words—<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Aut beatus, aut
                     nihil</foreign>; but, singular to tell, the religion which brought with it all
                  human tenderness and pities,—the hospital for the sick, the refuge for the orphan,
                  the enfranchisement of the slave,—this religion brought also the news of the
                  eternal, hopeless, living torture of the great majority of mankind,<pb n="82-83"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000042"/> past and present. Tender spirits, like those of
                  Dante, carried this awful mystery as a secret and unexplained anguish; saints
                  wrestled with God and wept over it; but still the awful fact remained, spite of
                  Church and sacrament, that the gospel was in effect, to the majority of the human
                  race, not the glad tidings of salvation, but the sentence of unmitigable doom.</p>
               <p>The present traveller in Italy sees with disgust the dim and faded frescoes in
                  which this doom is portrayed in all its varied refinements of torture; and the
                  vivid Italian mind ran riot in these lurid fields, and every monk who wanted to
                  move his audience was in his small way a Dante. The poet and the artist give only
                  the highest form of the ideas of their day, and he who cannot read the "Inferno"
                  with firm nerves may ask what the same representations were likely to have been in
                  the grasp of coarse and common minds.</p>
               <p>The first teachers of Christianity in Italy read the Gospels by the light of those
                  fiendish fires which consumed their fellows. Daily made familiar with the
                  scorching, the searing, the racking, the devilish ingenuities of torture, they
                  transferred them to the future hell of the torturers. The sentiment within us
                  which asserts eternal justice and retribution was stimulated to a kind of madness
                  by that first baptism of fire and blood, and expanded the simple and grave
                  warnings of the gospel into a lurid poetry of physical torture. Hence, while
                  Christianity brought multiplied forms of mercy into the world, it failed for many
                  centuries to humanize the savage forms of justice; and rack and wheel, fire and
                  fagot were the modes by which human justice aspired to a faint imitation of what
                  divine justice was supposed to extend through eternity.</p>
               <p>But it is remarkable always to observe the power of individual dividual minds to
                  draw out of the popular religious ideas of their country only those elements which
                  suit themselves, and to drop others from their thought. As a bee can extract pure
                  honey from the blossoms of some plants whose leaves are poisonous, so some souls
                  can nourish themselves only with the holier and more ethereal parts of popular
                  belief.</p>
               <p>Agnes had hitherto dwelt only on the cheering and the joyous features of her
                  faith; her mind loved to muse on the legends of saints and angels and the glories
                  of paradise, which, with a secret buoyancy, she hoped to be the lot of every one
                  she saw. The mind of the Mother Theresa was of the same elevated cast, and the
                  terrors on which Jocunda dwelt with such homely force of language seldom made a
                  part of her instructions.</p>
               <p>Agnes tried to dismiss these gloomy images from her mind, and, after arranging her
                  garlands, went to decorate the shrine and altar,—a cheerful labor of love, in
                  which she delighted.</p>
               <p>To the mind of the really spiritual Christian of those ages the air of this lower
                  world was not as it is to us, in spite of our nominal faith in the Bible, a blank,
                  empty space from which all spiritual sympathy and life have fled, but, like the
                  atmosphere with which Raphael has surrounded the Sistine Madonna, it was full of
                  sympathizing faces, a great "cloud of witnesses." The holy dead were not gone from
                  earth; the Church visible and invisible were in close, loving, and constant
                  sympathy,—still loving, praying, and watching together, though with a veil
                  between.</p>
               <p>It was at first with no idolatrous intention that the prayers of the holy dead
                  were invoked in acts of worship. Their prayers were asked simply because they were
                  felt to be as really present with their former friends and as truly sympathetic<pb
                     n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7945-00000043"/> pathetic as if no veil of silence had
                  fallen between. In time this simple belief had its intemperate and idolatrous
                  exaggerations,—the Italian soil always seeming to have a fiery and volcanic
                  forcing power, by which religious ideas overblossomed themselves, and grew wild
                  and ragged with too much enthusiasm; and, as so often happens with friends on
                  earth, these too much loved and revered invisible friends became eclipsing screens
                  instead of transmitting mediums of God's light to the soul.</p>
               <p>Yet we can see in the hymns of Savonarola, who perfectly represented the attitude
                  of the highest Christian of those times, how perfect might be the love and
                  veneration for departed saints without lapsing into idolatry, and with what an
                  atmosphere of warmth and glory the true belief of the unity of the Church, visible
                  and invisible, could inspire an elevated soul amid the discouragements of an
                  unbelieving and gainsaying world.</p>
               <p>Our little Agnes, therefore, when she had spread all her garlands out, seemed
                  really to feel as if the girlish figure that smiled in sacred white from the
                  altar-piece was a dear friend who smiled upon her, and was watching to lead her up
                  the path to heaven.</p>
               <p>Pleasantly passed the hours of that day to the girl, and when at evening old Elsie
                  called for her, she wondered that the day had gone so fast.</p>
               <p>Old Elsie returned with no inconsiderable triumph from her stand. The cavalier had
                  been several times during the day past her stall, and once, stopping in a careless
                  way to buy fruit, commented on the absence of her young charge. This gave Elsie
                  the highest possible idea of her own sagacity and shrewdness, and of the
                  promptitude with which she had taken her measures, so that she was in as good
                  spirits as people commonly are who think they have performed some stroke of
                  generalship.</p>
               <p>As the old woman and young girl emerged from the dark-vaulted passage that led
                  them down through the rocks on which the convent stood to the sea at its base, the
                  light of a most glorious sunset burst upon them, in all those strange and magical
                  mysteries of light which any one who has walked that beach of Sorrento at evening
                  will never forget.</p>
               <p>Agnes ran along the shore, and amused herself with picking up little morsels of
                  red and black coral, and those fragments of mosaic pavements, blue, red, and
                  green, which the sea is never tired of casting up from the thousands of ancient
                  temples and palaces which have gone to wreck all around these shores.</p>
               <p>As she was busy doing this, she suddenly heard the voice of Giulietta behind
                  her.</p>
               <p>"So ho, Agnes! where have you been all day?"</p>
               <p>"At the Convent," said Agnes, raising herself from her work, and smiling at
                  Giulietta, in her frank, open way.</p>
               <p>"Oh, then you really did take the ring to Saint Agnes?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure I did," said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"Simple child!" said Giulietta, laughing; "that was n't what he meant you to do
                  with it. He meant it for you,—only your grandmother was by. You never will have
                  any lovers, if she keeps you so tight."</p>
               <p>"I can do without," said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"I could tell you something about this one," said Giulietta.</p>
               <p>"You did tell me something yesterday," said Agnes.</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7945-00000044"/>
               <p>"But I could tell you some more. I know he wants to see you again."</p>
               <p>"What for?" said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"Simpleton, he's in love with you. You never had a lover;—it's time you had."</p>
               <p>"I don't want one, Giulietta. I hope I never shall see him again."</p>
               <p>"Oh, nonsense, Agnes! Why, what a girl you are! Why, before I was as old as you, I
                  had half-a-dozen lovers."</p>
               <p>"Agnes," said the sharp voice of Elsie, coming up from behind, "don't run on ahead
                  of me again;—and you, Mistress Baggage, let my child alone."</p>
               <p>"Who's touching your child?" said Giulietta, scornfully. "Can't a body say a civil
                  word to her?"</p>
               <p>"I know what you would be after," said Elsie,—"filling her head with talk of all
                  the wild, loose gallants; but she is for no such market, I promise you! Come,
                  Agnes."</p>
               <p>So saying, old Elsie drew Agnes rapidly along with her, leaving Giulietta rolling
                  her great black eyes after them with an air of infinite contempt.</p>
               <p>"The old kite!" she said; "I declare he shall get speech of the little dove, if
                  only to spite her. Let her try her best, and see if we don't get round her before
                  she knows it. Pietro says his master is certainly wild after her, and I have
                  promised to help him."</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, just as old Elsie and Agnes were turning into the orange-orchard which
                  led into the Gorge of Sorrento, they met the cavalier of the evening before.</p>
               <p>He stopped, and, removing his cap, saluted them with as much deference as if they
                  had been princesses. Old Elsie frowned, and Agnes blushed deeply;—both hurried
                  forward. Looking back, the old woman saw that he was walking slowly behind them,
                  evidently watching them closely, yet not in a way sufficiently obtrusive to
                  warrant an open rebuff.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE CAVALIER.</head>
               <p>NOTHING can be more striking, in common Italian life, than the contrast between
                  out-doors and in-doors. Without, all is fragrant and radiant; within, mouldy,
                  dark, and damp. Except in the well-kept palaces of the great, houses in Italy are
                  more like dens than habitations, and a sight of them is a sufficient reason to the
                  mind of any inquirer, why their vivacious and handsome inhabitants spend their
                  life principally in the open air. Nothing could be more perfectly paradisiacal
                  than this evening at Sorrento. The sun had sunk, but left the air full of diffused
                  radiance, which trembled and vibrated over the thousand many-colored waves of the
                  sea. The moon was riding in a broad zone of purple, low in the horizon, her silver
                  forehead somewhat flushed in the general rosiness that seemed to penetrate and
                  suffuse every object. The fishermen, who were drawing in their nets, gayly
                  singing, seemed to be floating on a violet-and-gold-colored flooring that broke
                  into a thousand gems at every dash of the oar or motion of the boat. The old stone
                  statue of Saint Antonio looked down in the rosy air, itself tinged and brightened
                  by the magical colors which floated round it. And the girls and men of Sorrento
                  gathered in gossiping knots on the old Roman bridge that spanned the gorge, looked
                  idly down into its dusky shadows, talking the while, and playing the time-honored
                  game of flirtation which has gone on in all climes and languages since man and
                  woman began.</p>
               <p>Conspicuous among them all was Giulietta, her blue-black hair recently braided and
                  polished to a glossy radiance, and all her costume arranged to show her comely
                  proportions to the best advantage,—her great pearl ear-rings shaking as she tossed
                  her head, and showing the flash of the emerald in the middle of them. An Italian
                  peasant-woman may trust Providence for her gown, but ear-rings she attends to
                  herself,—for what is life without them? The great pearl ear-rings of the Sorrento
                  women are accumulated, pearl by pearl, as the price of years of labor. Giulietta,
                  however, had come into the world, so to speak, with a gold spoon in her
                  mouth,—since her grandmother, a thriving, stirring, energetic body, had got
                  together a pair of ear-rings of unmatched size, which had descended as heirlooms
                  to her, leaving her nothing to do but display them, which she did with the freest
                  good-will. At present she was busily occupied in coquetting with a tall and
                  jauntily-dressed fellow, wearing a plumed hat and a red sash, who seemed to be
                  mesmerized by the power of her charms, his large dark eyes following every
                  movement, as she now talked with him gayly and freely, and now pretended errands
                  to this and that and the other person on the bridge, stationing herself here and
                  there, that she might have the pleasure of seeing herself followed.</p>
               <p>"Giulietta," at last said the young man, earnestly, when he found her accidentally
                  standing alone by the parapet, "I must be going to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Well, what is that to me?" said Giulietta, looking wickedly from under her
                  eyelashes.</p>
               <p>"Cruel girl! you know"——</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7945-00000046"/>
               <p>"Nonsense, Pietro! I don't know anything about you;" but as Giulietta said this,
                  her great, soft, dark eyes looked out furtively, and said just the contrary.</p>
               <p>"You will go with me?"</p>
               <p>"Did I ever hear anything like it? One can't be civil to a fellow but he asks her
                  to go to the world's end. Pray, how far is it to your dreadful old den?"</p>
               <p>"Only two days' journey, Giulietta."</p>
               <p>"Two days!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my life; and you shall ride."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Sir,—I wasn't thinking of walking. But seriously, Pietro, I am afraid
                  it's no place for an honest girl to be in."</p>
               <p>"There are lots of honest women there,—all our men have wives; and our captain has
                  put his eye on one, too, or I'm mistaken."</p>
               <p>"What! little Agnes?" said Giulietta. "He will be bright that gets her. That old
                  dragon of a grandmother is as tight to her as her skin."</p>
               <p>"Our captain is used to helping himself," said Pietro. "We might carry them both
                  off some night, and no one the wiser; but he seems to want to win the girl to come
                  to him of her own accord. At any rate, we are to be sent back to the mountains
                  while he lingers a day or two more round here.</p>
               <p>"I declare, Pietro, I think you all little better than Turks or heathens, to talk
                  in that way about carrying off women; and what if one should be sick and die among
                  you? What is to become of one's soul, I wonder?"</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! don't we have priests? Why, Giulietta, we are all very pious, and never
                  think of going out without saying our prayers. The Madonna is a kind Mother, and
                  will wink very hard on the sins of such good sons as we are. There is n't a place
                  in all Italy where she is kept better in candles, and in rings and bracelets, and
                  everything a woman could want. We never come home without bringing her something;
                  and then we have lots left to dress all our women like princesses; and they have
                  nothing to do from morning till night but play the lady. Come now?"</p>
               <p>At the moment this conversation was going on in the balmy, seductive evening air
                  at the bridge, another was transpiring in the Albergo della Torre, one of those
                  dark, musty dens of which we have been speaking. In a damp, dirty chamber, whose
                  brick floor seemed to have been unsuspicious of even the existence of brooms for
                  centuries, was sitting the cavalier whom we have so often named in connection with
                  Agnes. His easy, high-bred air, his graceful, flexible form and handsome face
                  formed a singular contrast to the dark and mouldy apartment, at whose single
                  unglazed window he was sitting. The sight of this splendid man gave an impression
                  of strangeness, in the general bareness, much as if some marvellous jewel had been
                  unaccountably found lying on that dusty brick floor.</p>
               <p>He sat deep in thought, with his elbow resting on a rickety table, his large,
                  piercing dark, eyes seeming intently to study the pavement.</p>
               <p>The door opened, and a gray-headed old man entered, who approached him
                  respectfully.</p>
               <p>"Well, Paolo?" said the cavalier, suddenly starting.</p>
               <p>"My Lord, the men are all going back to-night."</p>
               <p>"Let them go, then," said the cavalier, with an impatient movement. "I can follow
                  in a day or two."</p>
               <p>"Ah, my Lord, if I might make so bold, why should you<pb n="92-93"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000047"/> expose your person by staying longer? You may be
                  recognized and"——</p>
               <p>"No danger," said the other, hastily.</p>
               <p>"My Lord, you must forgive me, but I promised my dear lady, your mother, on her
                  death-bed"——</p>
               <p>"To be a constant plague to me," said the cavalier, with a vexed smile and an
                  impatient movement; "but speak on, Paolo,—for when you once get anything on your
                  mind, one may as well hear it first as last."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, my Lord, this girl,—I have made inquiries, and every one reports her
                  most modest and pious,—the only grandchild of a poor old woman. Is it worthy of a
                  great lord of an ancient house to bring her to shame?"</p>
               <p>"Who thinks of bringing her to shame? 'Lord of an ancient house'!" added the
                  cavalier, laughing bitterly,—"a landless beggar, cast out of everything,—titles,
                  estates, all! Am I, then, fallen so low that my wooing would disgrace a
                  peasant-girl?"</p>
               <p>"My Lord, you cannot mean to woo a peasant-girl in any other way than one that
                  would disgrace her,—one of the House of Sarelli, that goes back to the days of the
                  old Roman Empire!"</p>
               <p>"And what of the 'House of Sarelli that goes back to the days of the old Roman
                  Empire'? It is lying like weeds' roots uppermost in the burning sun. What is left
                  to me but the mountains and my sword? No, I tell you, Paolo, Agostino Sarelli,
                  cavalier of fortune, is not thinking of bringing disgrace on a pious and modest
                  maiden, unless it would disgrace her to be his wife."</p>
               <p>"Now may the saints above help us! Why, my Lord, our house in days past has been
                  allied to royal blood. I could tell you how Joachim VI."——</p>
               <p>"Come, come, my good Paolo, spare me one of your chapters of genealogy. The fact
                  is, my old boy, the world is all topsy-turvy, and the bottom is the top, and it is
                  n't much matter what comes next. Here are shoals of noble families uprooted and
                  lying round like those aloes that the gardener used to throw over the wall in
                  spring-time; and there is that great boar of a Cæsar Borgia turned in to batten
                  and riot over our pleasant places."</p>
               <p>"Oh, my Lord," said the old serving-man, with a distressful movement, "we have
                  fallen on evil times, to be sure, and they say his Holiness has excommunicated us.
                  Anselmo heard that in Naples yesterday."</p>
               <p>"Excommunicated!" said the young man,—every feature of his fine face, and every
                  nerve of his graceful form seeming to quiver with the effort to express supreme
                  contempt. "Excommunicated! I should <emph>hope</emph> so! One would hope through
                  Our Lady's grace to act so that Alexander, and his adulterous, incestuous, filthy,
                  false-swearing, perjured, murderous crew, <emph>would</emph> excommunicate us! In
                  these times, one's only hope of paradise lies in being excommunicated."</p>
               <p>"Oh, my dear master," said the old man, falling on his knees, "what is to become
                  of us? That I should live to hear you talk like an infidel and unbeliever!"</p>
               <p>"Why, hear you, poor old fool! Did you never hear in Dante of the Popes that are
                  burning in hell? Was n't Dante a Christian, I beg to know?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, my Lord, my Lord! a religion got out of poetry, books, and romances won't do
                  to die by. We have no business with the affairs of the Head of the Church,—it's
                  the Lord's appointment. We have only to shut our eyes and obey. It may all do well
                  enough to talk so when you are<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7945-00000048"/> young and
                  fresh; but when sickness and death come, then we <emph>must</emph> have
                  religion,—and if we have gone out of the only true Roman Catholic Apostolic
                  Church, what becomes of our souls? Ah, I misdoubted about your taking so much to
                  poetry, though my poor mistress was so proud of it; but these poets are all
                  heretics, my Lord,—that's my firm belief. But, my Lord, if you do go to hell, I'm
                  going there with you; I'm sure I never could show my face among the saints, and
                  you not there."</p>
               <p>"Well, come, then, my poor Paolo," said the cavalier, stretching out his hand to
                  his serving-man, "don't take it to heart so. Many a better man than I has been
                  excommunicated and cursed from toe to crown, and been never a whit the worse for
                  it. There's Jerome Savonarola there in Florence—a most holy man, they say, who has
                  had revelations straight from heaven—has been excommunicated; but he preaches and
                  gives the sacraments all the same, and nobody minds it."</p>
               <p>"Well, it's all a maze to me," said the old serving-man, shaking his white head.
                  "I can't see into it. I don't dare to open my eyes for fear I should get to be a
                  heretic; it seems to me that everything is getting mixed up together. But one must
                  hold on to one's religion; because, after we have lost everything in this world,
                  it would be too bad to burn in hell forever at the end of that."</p>
               <p>"Why, Paolo, I am a good Christian. I believe, with all my heart, in the Christian
                  religion, like the fellow in Boccaccio,—because I think it must be from God, or
                  else the Popes and Cardinals would have had it out of the world long ago. Nothing
                  but the Lord Himself could have kept it against them."</p>
               <p>"There you are, my dear master, with your romances! Well, well, well! I don't know
                  how it 'll end. I say my prayers, and try not to inquire into what's too high for
                  me. But now, dear master, will you stay lingering after this girl till some of our
                  enemies hear where you are and pounce down upon us? Besides, the troop are never
                  so well affected when you are away; there are quarrels and divisions."</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said the cavalier, with an impatient movement,—"one day longer. I
                  must get a chance to speak with her once more. I <emph>must</emph> see her."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE ARTIST MONK.</head>
               <p>ON the evening when Agnes and her grandmother returned from the Convent, as they
                  were standing after supper looking over the garden parapet into the gorge, their
                  attention was caught by a man in an ecclesiastical habit, slowly climbing the
                  rocky pathway towards them.</p>
               <p>"Is n't that brother Antonio?" said Dame Elsie, leaning forward to observe more
                  narrowly. "Yes, to be sure it is!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, how glad I am!" exclaimed Agnes, springing up with vivacity, and looking
                  eagerly down the path by which the stranger was approaching.</p>
               <p>A few moments more of clambering, and the stranger met the two women at the gate
                  with a gesture of benediction.</p>
               <p>He was apparently a little past the middle point of life, and entering on its
                  shady afternoon. He was tall and well proportioned, and his features had the spare
                  delicacy of the Italian outline. The round brow, fully developed in all the
                  perceptive and æsthetic regions,—the keen eye, shadowed by long, dark lashes,—the
                  thin, flexible lips,—the sunken cheek, where, on the slightest emotion, there
                  fluttered a brilliant flush of color,—all were signs telling of the enthusiast in
                  whom the nervous and spiritual predominated over the animal.</p>
               <p>At times, his eye had a dilating brightness, as if from the flickering of some
                  inward fire which was slowly consuming the mortal part, and its expression was
                  brilliant even to the verge of insanity.</p>
               <p>His dress was the simple, coarse, white stuff-gown of the Dominican friars, over
                  which he wore a darker travelling-garment of coarse cloth, with a hood, from whose
                  deep shadows his bright mysterious eyes looked like jewels from a cavern. At his
                  side dangled a great rosary and cross of black wood, and under his arm he carried
                  a portfolio secured with a leathern strap, which seemed stuffed to bursting with
                  papers.</p>
               <p>Father Antonio, whom we have thus introduced to the reader, was an itinerant
                  preaching monk from the Convent of San Marco in Florence, on a pastoral and
                  artistic tour through Italy.</p>
               <p>Convents in the Middle Ages were the retreats of multitudes of natures who did not
                  wish to live in a state of perpetual warfare and offence, and all the elegant arts
                  flourished under their protecting shadows. Ornamental gardening, pharmacy,
                  drawing, painting, carving in wood, illumination, and calligraphy were not
                  unfrequent occupations of the holy fathers, and the convent has given to the
                  illustrious roll of Italian Art some of its most brilliant names. No institution
                  in modern Europe had a more established reputation in all these respects than the
                  Convent of San Marco in Florence. In its best days, it was as near an approach to
                  an ideal community, associated to unite religion, beauty, and utility, as ever has
                  existed on earth. It was a retreat from the commonplace prose of life into an
                  atmosphere at once devotional and poetic; and prayers and sacred hymns consecrated
                  the elegant labors of the chisel and the pencil, no less than the more homely ones
                  of the still and the crucible. San Marco, far from being that kind of sluggish
                  lagoon often<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7945-00000050"/> imagined in conventual life,
                  was rather a sheltered hot-bed of ideas,—fervid with intellectual and moral
                  energy, and before the age in every radical movement. At this period, Savonarola,
                  the poet and prophet of the Italian religious world of his day, was superior of
                  this convent, pouring through all the members of the order the fire of his own
                  impassioned nature, and seeking to lead them back to the fervors of more primitive
                  and evangelical ages, and in the reaction of a worldly and corrupt Church was
                  beginning to feel the power of that current which at last drowned his eloquent
                  voice in the cold waters of martyrdom. Savonarola was an Italian Luther,—differing
                  from the great Northern Reformer as the more ethereally strung and nervous Italian
                  differs from the bluff and burly German; and like Luther he became in his time the
                  centre of every living thing in society about him. He inspired the pencils of
                  artists, guided the counsels of statesmen, and, a poet himself, was an inspiration
                  to poets. Everywhere in Italy the monks of his order were travelling, restoring
                  the shrines, preaching against the voluptuous and unworthy pictures with which
                  sensual artists had desecrated the churches, and calling the people back by their
                  exhortations to the purity of primitive Christianity.</p>
               <p>Father Antonio was a younger brother of Elsie, and had early become a member of
                  the San Marco, enthusiastic not less in religion than in Art. His intercourse with
                  his sister had few points of sympathy, Elsie being as decided a utilitarian as any
                  old Yankee female born in the granite hills of New Hampshire, and pursuing with a
                  hard and sharp energy her narrow plan of life for Agnes. She regarded her brother
                  as a very properly religious person, considering his calling, but was a little
                  bored with his exuberant devotion, and absolutely indifferent to his artistic
                  enthusiasm. Agnes, on the contrary, had from a child attached herself to her uncle
                  with all the energy of a sympathetic nature, and his yearly visits had been looked
                  forward to on her part with intense expectation. To him she could say a thousand
                  things which she instinctively concealed from her grandmother; and Elsie was well
                  pleased with the confidence, because it relieved her a little from the vigilant
                  guardianship that she otherwise held over the girl. When Father Antonio was near,
                  she had leisure now and then for a little private gossip of her own, without the
                  constant care of supervising Agnes.</p>
               <p>"Dear uncle, how glad I am to see you once more!" was the eager salutation with
                  which the young girl received the monk, as he gained the little garden. "And you
                  have brought your pictures;—oh, I know you have so many pretty things to show
                  me!"</p>
               <p>"Well, well, child," said Elsie, "don't begin upon that now. A little talk of
                  bread and cheese will be more in point. Come in, brother, and wash your feet, and
                  let me beat the dust out of your cloak, and give you something to stay Nature; for
                  you must be fasting."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sister," said the monk; "and as for you, pretty one, never mind what
                  she says. Uncle Antonio will show his little Agnes everything by-and-by.—A good
                  little thing it is, sister."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes,—good enough,—and too good," said Elsie, bustling about;—"roses can't
                  help having thorns, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"Only our ever-blessed Rose of Sharon, the dear mystical Rose of Paradise, can
                  boast of having no thorns," said the monk, bowing and crossing himself
                  devoutly.</p>
               <p>Agnes clasped her hands on her bosom and bowed also,<pb n="100-101"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000051"/> while Elsie stopped with her knife in the middle of
                  a loaf of black bread, and crossed herself with somewhat of impatience,—like a
                  worldly-minded person of our day, who is interrupted in the midst of an
                  observation by a grace.</p>
               <p>After the rites of hospitality had been duly observed, the old dame seated herself
                  contentedly in her door with her distaff, resigned Agnes to the safe guardianship
                  of her uncle, and had a feeling of security in seeing them sitting together on the
                  parapet of the garden, with the portfolio spread out between them,—the warm
                  twilight glow of the evening sky lighting up their figures as they bent in ardent
                  interest over its contents. The portfolio showed a fluttering collection of
                  sketches,—fruits, flowers, animals, insects, faces, figures, shrines, buildings,
                  trees,—all, in short, that might strike the mind of a man to whose eye nothing on
                  the face of the earth is without beauty and significance.</p>
               <p>"Oh, how beautiful!" said the girl, taking up one sketch, in which a bunch of rosy
                  cyclamen was painted rising out of a bed of moss.</p>
               <p>"Ah, that indeed, my dear!" said the artist. "Would you had seen the place where I
                  painted it! I stopped there to recite my prayers one morning; 't was by the side
                  of a beautiful cascade, and all the ground was covered with these lovely
                  cyclamens, and the air was musky with their fragrance.—Ah, the bright rose-colored
                  leaves! I can get no color like them, unless some angel would bring me some from
                  those sunset clouds yonder."</p>
               <p>"And oh, dear uncle, what lovely primroses!" pursued Agnes, taking up another
                  paper.</p>
               <p>"Yes, child; but you should have seen them when I was coming down the south side
                  of the Apennines;—these were everywhere so pale and sweet, they seemed like the
                  humility ity of our Most Blessed Mother in her lowly mortal state. I am minded to
                  make a border of primroses to the leaf in the Breviary where is the 'Hail,
                  Mary!'—for it seems as if that flower doth ever say, 'Behold the handmaid of the
                  Lord!'"</p>
               <p>"And what will you do with the cyclamen, uncle? does not that mean something!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, daughter," replied the monk, readily entering into that symbolical strain
                  which permeated all the heart and mind of the religious of his day,—"I
                     <emph>can</emph> see a meaning in it. For you see that the cyclamen puts forth
                  its leaves in early spring deeply engraven with mystical characters, and loves
                  cool shadows, and moist, dark places, but comes at length to wear a royal crown of
                  crimson; and it seems to me like the saints who dwell in convents and other
                  prayerful places, and have the word of God graven in their hearts in youth, till
                  these blossom into fervent love, and they are crowned with royal graces."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" sighed Agnes, "how beautiful and how blessed to be among such!"</p>
               <p>"Thou sayest well, dear child. Blessed are the flowers of God that grow in cool
                  solitudes, and have never been profaned by the hot sun and dust of this
                  world!"</p>
               <p>"I should like to be such a one," said Agnes. "I often think, when I visit the
                  sisters at the Convent, that I long to be one of them."</p>
               <p>"A pretty story!" said Dame Elsie, who had heard the last words,—"go into a
                  convent and leave your poor grandmother all alone, when she has toiled night and
                  day for so many years to get a dowry for you and find you a worthy husband!"</p>
               <p>"I don't want any husband in this world, grandmamma," said Agnes.</p>
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7945-00000052"/>
               <p>"What talk is this? Not want a good husband to take care of you when your poor old
                  grandmother is gone? Who will provide for you?"</p>
               <p>"He who took care of the blessed Saint Agnes, grandmamma."</p>
               <p>"Saint Agnes, to be sure! That was a great many years ago, and times have altered
                  since then;—in these days girls must have husbands. Is n't it so, brother
                  Antonio?"</p>
               <p>"But if the darling hath a vocation?" said the artist, mildly.</p>
               <p>"Vocation! I'll see to that! She sha'n't have a vocation! Suppose I'm going to
                  delve, and toil, and spin, and wear myself to the bone, and have her slip through
                  my fingers at last with a vocation? No, indeed!"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, dear grandmother, don't be angry!" said Agnes. "I will do just as you
                  say,—only I don't want a husband."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, my little heart,—one thing at a time; you sha'n't have him till you
                  say yes willingly," said Elsie, in a mollified tone.</p>
               <p>Agnes turned again to the portfolio and busied herself with it, her eyes dilating
                  as she ran over the sketches.</p>
               <p>"Ah! what pretty, pretty bird is this?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"Knowest thou not that bird, with his little red beak?" said the artist. "When our
                  dear Lord hung bleeding, and no man pitied him, this bird, filled with tender
                  love, tried to draw out the nails with his poor little beak,—so much better were
                  the birds than we hard-hearted sinners!—hence he hath honor in many pictures. See
                  here,—I shall put him into the office of the Sacred Heart, in a little nest
                  curiously built in a running vine of passion-flower. See here, daughter,—I have a
                  great commission to execute a Breviary for our house, and our holy Father was
                  pleased to say that the spirit of the blessed Angelico had in some little humble
                  measure descended on me, and now I am busy day and night; for not a twig rustles,
                  not a bird flies, nor a flower blossoms, but I begin to see therein some hint of
                  holy adornment to my blessed work."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Uncle Antonio, how happy you must be!" said Agnes,—her large eyes filling
                  with tears.</p>
               <p>"Happy!—child, am I not?" said the monk, looking up and crossing himself. "Holy
                  Mother, am I not? Do I not walk the earth in a dream of bliss, and see the
                  footsteps of my Most Blessed Lord and his dear Mother on every rock and hill? I
                  see the flowers rise up in clouds to adore them. What am I, unworthy sinner, that
                  such grace is granted me? Often I fall on my face before the humblest flower where
                  my dear Lord hath written his name, and confess I am unworthy the honor of copying
                  his sweet handiwork."</p>
               <p>The artist spoke these words with his hands clasped and his fervid eyes upraised,
                  like a man in an ecstasy; nor can our more prosaic English give an idea of the
                  fluent naturalness and grace with which such images melt into that lovely tongue
                  which seems made to be the natural language of poetry and enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>Agnes looked up to him with humble awe, as to some celestial being; but there was
                  a sympathetic glow in her face, and she put her hands on her bosom, as her manner
                  often was when much moved, and, drawing a deep sigh, said,—</p>
               <p>"Would that such gifts were mine!"</p>
               <p>"They are thine, sweet one," said the monk. "In Christ's dear kingdom is no mine
                  or thine, but all that<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7945-00000053"/> each hath is the
                  property of others. I never rejoice so much in my art as when I think of the
                  communion of saints, and that all that our Blessed Lord will work through me is
                  the property of the humblest soul in his kingdom. When I see one flower rarer than
                  another, or a bird singing on a twig, I take note of the same, and say, 'This
                  lovely work of God shall be for some shrine, or the border of a missal, or the
                  foreground of an altar-piece, and thus shall his saints be comforted.'"</p>
               <p>"But," said Agnes, fervently, "how little can a poor young maiden do! Ah, I do so
                  long to offer myself up in some way to the dear Lord, who gave himself for us, and
                  for his Most Blessed Church!"</p>
               <p>As Agnes spoke these words, her cheek, usually so clear and pale, became suffused
                  with a tremulous color, and her dark eyes had a deep, divine expression;—a moment
                  after, the color slowly faded, her head drooped, and her long, dark lashes fell on
                  her cheek, while her hands were folded on her bosom. The eye of the monk was
                  watching her with an enkindled glance.</p>
               <p>"Is she not the very presentment of our Blessed Lady in the Annunciation?" said he
                  to himself. "Surely, this grace is upon her for this special purpose. My prayers
                  are answered.</p>
               <p>"Daughter," he began, in a gentle tone, "a glorious work has been done of late in
                  Florence under the preaching of our blessed Superior. Could you believe it,
                  daughter, in these times of backsliding and rebuke there have been found painters
                  base enough to paint the pictures of vile, abandoned women in the character of our
                  Blessed Lady; yea, and princes have been found wicked enough to buy them and put
                  them up in churches, so that the people have had the Mother of all Purity
                  presented to them in the guise of a vile harlot. Is it not dreadful?"</p>
               <p>"How horrible!" said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"Ah, but you should have seen the great procession through Florence, when all the
                  little children were inspired by the heavenly preaching of our dear Master. These
                  dear little ones, carrying the blessed cross and singing the hymns our Master had
                  written for them, went from house to house and church to church, demanding that
                  everything that was vile and base should be delivered up to the flames,—and the
                  people, beholding, thought that the angels had indeed come down, and brought forth
                  all their loose pictures and vile books, such as Boccaccio's romances and other
                  defilements, and the children made a splendid bonfire of them in the Grand Piazza,
                  and so thousands of vile things were consumed and scattered. And then our blessed
                  Master exhorted the artists to give their pencils to Christ and his Mother, and to
                  seek for her image among pious and holy women living a veiled and secluded life,
                  like that our Lady lived before the blessed Annunciation. 'Think you,' he said,
                  'that the blessed Angelico obtained the grace to set forth our Lady in such
                  heavenly wise by gazing about the streets on mincing women tricked out in all the
                  world's bravery?—or did he not find her image in holy solitudes, among modest and
                  prayerful saints?'"</p>
               <p>"Ah," said Agnes, drawing in her breath with an expression of awe, "what mortal
                  would dare to sit for the image of our Lady!"</p>
               <p>"Dear child, there be women whom the Lord crowns with beauty when they know it
                  not, and our dear Mother sheds so much of her spirit into their hearts that it
                  shines out in their faces; and among such must the painter look. Dear<pb
                     n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7945-00000054"/> little child, be not ignorant that our
                  Lord hath shed this great grace on thee. I have received a light that thou art to
                  be the model for the 'Hail Mary!' in my Breviary."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, no, no! it cannot be!" said Agnes, covering her face with her hands.</p>
               <p>"My daughter, thou art very beautiful, and this beauty was given thee not for
                  thyself, but to be laid like a sweet flower on the altar of thy Lord. Think how
                  blessed, if, through thee, the faithful be reminded of the modesty and humility of
                  Mary, so that their prayers become more fervent,—would it not be a great
                  grace?"</p>
               <p>"Dear uncle," said Agnes, "I am Christ's child. If it be as you say,—which I did
                  not know,—give me some days to pray and prepare my soul, that I may offer myself
                  in all humility."</p>
               <p>During this conversation Elsie had left the garden and gone a little way down the
                  gorge, to have a few moments of gossip with an old crony. The light of the evening
                  sky had gradually faded away, and the full moon was pouring a shower of silver
                  upon the orange-trees. As Agnes sat on the parapet, with the moonlight streaming
                  down on her young, spiritual face, now tremulous with deep suppressed emotion, the
                  painter thought he had never seen any human creature that looked nearer to his
                  conception of a celestial being.</p>
               <p>They both sat awhile in that kind of quietude which often falls between two who
                  have stirred some deep fountain of emotion. All was so still around them, that the
                  drip and trickle of the little stream which fell from the garden wall into the
                  dark abyss of the gorge could well be heard as it pattered from one rocky point to
                  another, with a slender, lulling sound.</p>
               <p>Suddenly the reveries of the two were disturbed by the shadow of a figure which
                  passed into the moonlight and seemed to rise from the side of the gorge. A man
                  enveloped in a dark cloak with a peaked hood stepped across the moss-grown garden
                  parapet, stood a moment irresolute, then the cloak dropped suddenly from him, and
                  the cavalier stood in the moonlight before Agnes. He bore in his hand a tall stalk
                  of white lily, with open blossoms and buds and tender fluted green leaves, such as
                  one sees in a thousand pictures of the Annunciation. The moonlight fell full upon
                  his face, revealing his haughty yet beautiful features, agitated by some profound
                  emotion. The monk and the girl were both too much surprised for a moment to utter
                  a sound; and when, after an instant, the monk made a half-movement as if to
                  address him, the cavalier raised his right hand with a sudden authoritative
                  gesture which silenced him. Then turning toward Agnes, he kneeled, and kissing the
                  hem of her robe, and laying the lily in her lap, "Holiest and dearest," he said,
                  "oh, forget not to pray for me!" He rose again in a moment, and, throwing his
                  cloak around him, sprang over the garden wall, and was heard rapidly descending
                  into the shadows of the gorge.</p>
               <p>All this passed so quickly that it seemed to both the spectators like a dream. The
                  splendid man, with his jewelled weapons, his haughty bearing, and air of easy
                  command, bowing with such solemn humility before the peasant-girl, reminded the
                  monk of the barbaric princes in the wonderful legends he had read, who had been
                  drawn by some heavenly inspiration to come and render themselves up to the
                  teachings of holy virgins, chosen of the Lord, in divine solitudes. In the
                  poetical world in which he lived all such marvels were possible. There were a
                  thousand precedents for them in that devout dream-land, "The Lives of the
                  Saints."</p>
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7945-00000055"/>
               <p>"My daughter," he said, after looking vainly down the dark shadows upon the path
                  of the stranger, "have you ever seen this man before?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, uncle; yesterday evening I saw him for the first time, when sitting at my
                  stand at the gate of the city. It was at the Ave Maria; he came up there and asked
                  my prayers, and gave me a diamond ring for the shrine of Saint Agnes, which I
                  carried to the convent to-day."</p>
               <p>"Behold, my dear daughter, the confirmation of what I have just said to thee! It
                  is evident that our Lady hath endowed thee with the great grace of a beauty which
                  draws the soul upward towards the angels, instead of downward to sensual things,
                  like the beauty of worldly women. What saith the blessed poet Dante of the beauty
                  of the holy Beatrice?—that it said to every man who looked on her,
                     '<emph>Aspire!</emph>'<ref rend="super" target="#note_002" xml:id="return_002"
                     >1</ref>

                           <l>That every tongue becometh trembling mute</l>

               <p>"I would," said Agnes, thoughtfully, "that I knew who this stranger is, and what
                  is his great trouble and need,—his eyes are so full of sorrow. Giulietta said he
                  was the King's brother, and was called the Lord Adrian. What sorrow can he have,
                  or what need for the prayers of a poor maid like me?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps the Lord hath pierced him with a longing after the celestial beauty and
                  heavenly purity of paradise, and wounded him with a divine sorrow, as happened to
                  Saint Francis and to the blessed Saint Dominic," said the monk. "Beauty is the
                  Lord's arrow, wherewith he pierceth to the inmost soul, with a divine longing and
                  languishment which find rest only in him. Hence thou seest the wounds of love in
                  saints are always painted by us with holy flames ascending from them. Have good
                  courage, sweet child, and pray with fervor for this youth; for there be no prayers
                  sweeter before the throne of God than those of spotless maidens. The Scripture
                  saith, 'My beloved feedeth among the lilies.'"</p>
               <p>At this moment the sharp, decided tramp of Elsie was heard reëntering the
                  garden.</p>
               <p>"Come, Agnes," she said, "it is time for you to begin your prayers, or, the saints
                  know, I shall not get you to bed till midnight. I suppose prayers are a good
                  thing," she added, seating herself wearily; "but if one must have so many of them,
                  one must get about them early. There's reason in all things."</p>
               <p>Agnes, who had been sitting abstractedly on the parapet, with her head drooped
                  over the lily-spray, now seemed to collect herself. She rose up in a grave and
                  thoughtful manner, and, going forward to the shrine of the Madonna, removed the
                  flowers of the morning, and holding the vase under the spout of the fountain, all
                  feathered with waving<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7945-00000056"/> maiden-hair,
                  filled it with fresh water, the drops falling from it in a thousand little silver
                  rings in the moonlight.</p>
               <p>"I have a thought," said the monk to himself, drawing from his girdle a pencil and
                  hastily sketching by the moonlight. What he drew was a fragile maiden form,
                  sitting with clasped hands on a mossy ruin, gazing on a spray of white lilies
                  which lay before her. He called it, The Blessed Virgin pondering the Lily of the
                  Annunciation.</p>
               <p>"Hast thou ever reflected," he said to Agnes, "what that lily might be like which
                  the angel Gabriel brought to our Lady?—for, trust me, it was no mortal flower, but
                  grew by the river of life. I have often meditated thereon, that it was like unto
                  living silver with a light in itself, like the moon,—even as our Lord's garments
                  in the Transfiguration, which glistened like the snow. I have cast about in myself
                  by what device a painter might represent so marvellous a flower."</p>
               <p>"Now, brother Antonio," said Elsie, "if you begin to talk to the child about such
                  matters, our Lady alone knows when we shall get to bed. I am sure I'm as good a
                  Christian as anybody; but, as I said, there's reason in all things, and one cannot
                  always be wondering and inquiring into heavenly matters,—as to every feather in
                  Saint Michael's wings, and as to our Lady's girdle and shoestrings and thimble and
                  work-basket; and when one gets through with our Lady, then one has it all to go
                  over about her mother, the blessed Saint Anne (may her name be ever praised!). I
                  mean no disrespect, but I am certain the saints are reasonable folk and must see
                  that poor folk must live, and, in order to live, must think of something else now
                  and then besides <emph>them</emph>. That's my mind, brother."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, sister," said the monk placidly, "no doubt you are right. There shall
                  be no quarrelling in the Lord's vineyard; every one hath his manner and place, and
                  you follow the lead of the blessed Saint Martha, which is holy and honorable."</p>
               <p>"Honorable! I should think it might be!" said Elsie. "I warrant me, if everything
                  had been left to Saint Mary's doings, our Blessed Lord and the Twelve Apostles
                  might have gone supperless. But it's Martha gets all the work, and Mary all the
                  praise."</p>
               <p>"Quite right, quite right," said the monk, abstractedly, while he stood out in the
                  moonlight busily sketching the fountain. By just such a fountain, he thought, our
                  Lady might have washed the clothes of the Blessed Babe. Doubtless there was some
                  such in the court of her dwelling, all mossy, and with sweet waters forever
                  singing a song of praise therein.</p>
               <p>Elsie was heard within the house meanwhile making energetic commotion, rattling
                  pots and pans, and producing decided movements among the simple furniture of the
                  dwelling, probably with a view to preparing for the night's repose of the
                  guest.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Agnes, kneeling before the shrine, was going through with great feeling
                  and tenderness the various manuals and movements of nightly devotion which her own
                  religious fervor and the zeal of her spiritual advisers had enjoined upon her.
                  Christianity, when it entered Italy, came among a people every act of whose life
                  was colored and consecrated by symbolic and ritual acts of heathenism. The only
                  possible way to uproot this was in supplanting it by Christian ritual and
                  symbolism equally minute and pervading. Besides, in those ages when the Christian
                  preacher was utterly destitute of all the help which the press now<pb n="112-113"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000057"/> gives in keeping under the eye of converts the
                  great inspiring truths of religion, it was one of the first offices of every saint
                  whose preaching stirred the heart of the people, to devise symbolic forms, signs,
                  and observances, by which the mobile and fluid heart of the multitude might
                  crystallize into habits of devout remembrance. The rosary, the crucifix, the
                  shrine, the banner, the procession, were catechisms and tracts invented for those
                  who could not read, wherein the substance of pages was condensed and gave itself
                  to the eye and the touch. Let us not, from the height of our day, with the better
                  appliances which a universal press gives us, sneer at the homely rounds of the
                  ladder by which the first multitudes of the Lord's followers climbed
                  heavenward.</p>
               <p>If there seemed somewhat mechanical in the number of times which Agnes repeated
                  the "Hail, Mary!"—in the prescribed number of times she rose or bowed or crossed
                  herself or laid her forehead in low humility on the flags of the pavement, it was
                  redeemed by the earnest fervor which inspired each action. However foreign to the
                  habits of a Northern mind or education such a mode of prayer may be, these forms
                  to her were all helpful and significant, her soul was borne by them Godward,—and
                  often, as she prayed, it seemed to her that she could feel the dissolving of all
                  earthly things, and the pressing nearer and nearer of the great cloud of witnesses
                  who ever surround the humblest member of Christ's mystical body. <q>

               <p>Certain English writers, looking entirely from a worldly and philosophical
                  stand-point, are utterly at a loss to account for the power which certain Italian
                  women of obscure birth came to exercise in the councils of nations merely by the
                  force of a mystical piety; but the Northern mind of Europe is entirely unfitted to
                  read and appreciate the psychological religious phenomena of Southern races. The
                  temperament which in our modern days has been called the mediïstic, and which with
                  us is only exceptional, is more or less a race-peculiarity of Southern climates,
                  and gives that objectiveness to the conception of spiritual things from which grew
                  up a whole ritual and a whole world of religious Art. The Southern saints and
                  religious artists were seers,—men and women of that peculiar fineness and delicacy
                  of temperament which made them especially apt to receive and project outward the
                  truths of the spiritual life; they were in that state of "divine madness" which is
                  favorable to the most intense conception of the poet and artist, and something of
                  this influence descended through all the channels of the people.</p>
               <p>When Agnes rose from prayer, she had a serene, exalted expression, like one who
                  walks with some unseen excellence and meditates on some untold joy. As she was
                  crossing the court to come towards her uncle, her eye was attracted by the sparkle
                  of something on the ground, and, stooping, she picked up a heart-shaped locket,
                  curiously made of a large amethyst, and fastened with a golden arrow. As she
                  pressed upon this, the locket opened and disclosed to her view a folded paper. Her
                  mood at this moment was so calm and elevated that she received the incident with
                  no start or shiver of the nerves. To her it seemed a Providential token, which
                  would probably bring to her some further knowledge of this mysterious being who
                  had been so especially confided to her intercessions.</p>
               <p>Agnes had learned of the Superior of the Convent the art<pb n="114-115"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000058"/> of reading writing, which would never have been the
                  birth-right of the peasant-girl in her times, and the moon had that dazzling
                  clearness which revealed every letter. She stood by the parapet, one hand lying in
                  the white blossoming alyssum which filled its marble crevices, while she read and
                  seriously pondered the contents of the paper. <q>

               </p>
               <p>There might have been times in Agnes's life when the reception of this note would
                  have astonished and perplexed her; but the whole strain of thought and
                  conversation this evening had been in exalted and poetical regions, and the soft
                  stillness of the hour, the wonderful calmness and clearness of the moonlight, all
                  seemed in unison with the strange incident that had occurred, and with the still
                  stranger tenor of the paper. The soft melancholy, half-religious tone of it was in
                  accordance with the whole under-current of her life, and prevented that start of
                  alarm which any homage of a more worldly form might have excited. It is not to be
                  wondered at, therefore, that she read it many times with pauses and intervals of
                  deep thought, and then with a movement of natural and girlish curiosity examined
                  the rich jewel which had enclosed it. At last, seeming to collect her thoughts,
                  she folded the paper and replaced it in its sparkling casket, and, unlocking the
                  door of the shrine, laid the gem with its enclosure beneath the lily-spray, as
                  another offering to the Madonna. "Dear Mother," she said, "if indeed it be so, may
                  he rise from loving me to loving thee and thy dear Son, who is Lord of all! Amen!"
                  Thus praying, she locked the door and turned thoughtfully to her repose, leaving
                  the monk pacing up and down in the moonlit garden.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the cavalier was standing on the velvet mossy bridge which spanned the
                  stream at the bottom of the gorge, watching the play of moonbeams on layer after
                  layer of tremulous silver foliage in the clefts of the black, rocky walls on
                  either side. The moon rode so high in the deep violet-colored sky, that her beams
                  came down almost vertically, making green and translucent the leaves through which
                  they passed, and throwing strongly marked shadows here and there on the
                  flower-embroidered moss of the old bridge. There was that solemn, plaintive
                  stillness in the air which makes the least sound—the hum of an insect's wing, the
                  cracking of a twig, the patter of falling water—so distinct and impressive.</p>
               <p>It needs not to be explained how the cavalier, following the steps of Agnes and
                  her grandmother at a distance, had threaded the path by which they ascended to
                  their little sheltered nook,—how he had lingered within hearing of Agnes's voice,
                  and, moving among the surrounding rocks and trees, and drawing nearer and nearer
                  as evening shadows drew on, had listened to the conversation, hoping that<pb
                     n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7945-00000059"/> some unexpected chance might gain him a
                  moment's speech with his enchantress.</p>
               <p>The reader will have gathered from the preceding chapter that the conception which
                  Agnes had formed as to the real position of her admirer from the reports of
                  Giulietta was false, and that in reality he was not Lord Adrian, the brother of
                  the King, but an outcast and landless representative of one branch of an ancient
                  and noble Roman family, whose estates had been confiscated and whose relations had
                  been murdered, to satisfy the boundless rapacity of Cæsar Borgia, the infamous
                  favorite of the notorious Alexander VI.</p>
               <p>The natural temperament of Agostino Sarelli had been rather that of the poet and
                  artist than of the warrior. In the beautiful gardens of his ancestral home it had
                  been his delight to muse over the pages of Dante; to sing to the lute, and to
                  write in the facile flowing rhyme of his native Italian, the fancies of the
                  dream-land of his youth.</p>
               <p>He was the younger brother of the family,—the favorite son and companion of his
                  mother, who, being of a tender and religious nature, had brought him up in habits
                  of the most implicit reverence and devotion for the institutions of his
                  fathers.</p>
               <p>The storm which swept over his house, and blasted all his worldly prospects,
                  blasted, too, and withered all those religious hopes and beliefs by which alone
                  sensitive and affectionate natures can be healed of the wounds of adversity
                  without <unclear>leaving</unclear> distortion or scar. For his house had been
                  over-thrown, his elder brother cruelly and treacherously murdered, himself and his
                  retainers robbed and cast out, by a man who had the entire sanction and support of
                  the Head of the Christian Church, the Vicar of Christ on Earth. So said the
                  current belief of his times,—the faith in which his sainted mother died; and the
                  difficulty with which a man breaks away from such ties is in exact proportion to
                  the refinement and elevation of his nature.</p>
               <p>In the mind of our young nobleman there was a double current. He was a Roman, and
                  the traditions of his house went back to the time of Mutius Scævola; and his old
                  nurse had often told him that grand story of how the young hero stood with his
                  right hand in the fire rather than betray his honor. If the legends of Rome's
                  ancient heroes cause the pulses of colder climes and alien races to throb with
                  sympathetic heroism, what must their power be to one who says, "<emph>These were
                     my fathers</emph>"? Agostino read Plutarch, and thought, "I, too, am a
                  Roman!"—and then he looked on the power that held sway over the Tarpeian Rock and
                  the halls of the old "Sanctus Senatus," and asked himself, "By what right does it
                  hold these?" He knew full well that in the popular belief all those hardy and
                  virtuous old Romans whose deeds of heroism so transported him were burning in hell
                  for the crime of having been born before Christ; and he asked himself, as he
                  looked on the horrible and unnatural luxury and vice which defiled the Papal chair
                  and ran riot through every ecclesiastical order, whether such men, without faith,
                  without conscience, and without even decency, were indeed the only authorized
                  successors of Christ and his Apostles?</p>
               <p>To us, of course, from our modern stand-point, the question has an easy
                  solution,—but not so in those days, when the Christianity of the known world was
                  in the Romish church, and when the choice seemed to be between that and
                  infidelity. Not yet had Luther flared aloft the bold, cheery torch which showed
                  the faithful how to disentangle Christianity from Ecclesiasticism. Luther in those
                  days was a<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7945-00000060"/> star lying low in the gray
                  horizon of a yet unawakened dawn.</p>
               <p>All through Italy at this time there was the restless throbbing and pulsating, the
                  aimless outreach of the popular heart, which marks the decline of one cycle of
                  religious faith and calls for some great awakening and renewal. Savonarola, the
                  priest and prophet of this dumb desire, was beginning to heave a great heart of
                  conflict towards that mighty struggle with the vices and immoralities of his time
                  in which he was yet to sink a martyr; and even now his course was beginning to be
                  obstructed by the full energy of the whole aroused serpent brood which hissed and
                  knotted in the holy places of Rome.</p>
               <p>Here, then, was our Agostino, with a nature intensely fervent and poetic, every
                  fibre of whose soul and nervous system had been from childhood skilfully woven and
                  intertwined with the ritual and faith of his fathers, yearning towards the grave
                  of his mother, yearning towards the legends of saints and angels with which she
                  had lulled his cradle slumbers and sanctified his childhood's pillow, and yet
                  burning with the indignation of a whole line of old Roman ancestors against an
                  injustice and oppression wrought under the full approbation of the head of that
                  religion. Half his nature was all the while battling the other half. Would he be
                  Roman, or would he be Christian? All the Roman in him said "No!" when he thought
                  of submission to the patent and open injustice and fiendish tyranny which had
                  disinherited him, slain his kindred, and held its impure reign by torture and by
                  blood. He looked on the splendid snow-crowned mountains whose old silver senate
                  engirdles Rome with an eternal and silent majesty of presence, and he thought how
                  often in ancient times they had been a shelter to free blood that would not endure
                  oppression; and so gathering to his banner the crushed and scattered retainers of
                  his father's house, and offering refuge and protection to multitudes of others
                  whom the crimes and rapacities of the Borgias had stripped of possessions and
                  means of support, he fled to a fastness in the mountains between Rome and Naples,
                  and became an independent chieftain, living by his sword.</p>
               <p>The rapacity, cruelty, and misgovernment of the various regular authorities of
                  Italy at this time made brigandage a respectable and honored institution in the
                  eyes of the people, though it was ostensibly banned both by Pope and Prince.
                  Besides, in the multitude of contending factions which were every day wrangling
                  for supremacy, it soon became apparent, even to the ruling authorities, that a
                  band of fighting-men under a gallant leader, advantageously posted in the
                  mountains and understanding all their passes, was a power of no small importance
                  to be employed on one side or the other; and therefore it happened, that, though
                  nominally outlawed or excommunicated, they were secretly protected on both sides,
                  with a view to securing their assistance in critical turns of affairs.</p>
               <p>Among the common people of the towns and villages their relations were of the most
                  comfortable kind, their depredations being chiefly confined to the rich and
                  prosperous, who, as they wrung their wealth out of the people, were not considered
                  particular objects of compassion when the same kind of high-handed treatment was
                  extended toward themselves.</p>
               <p>The most spirited and brave of the young peasantry, if they wished to secure the
                  smiles of the girls of their neighborhood, and win hearts past redemption, found
                  no surer avenue to favor than in joining the brigands. The leaders<pb n="120-121"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000061"/> of these bands sometimes piqued themselves on
                  elegant tastes and accomplishments; and one of them is said to have sent to the
                  poet Tasso, in his misfortunes and exile, an offer of honorable asylum and
                  protection in his mountain-fortress.</p>
               <p>Agostino Sarelli saw himself, in fact, a powerful chief; and there were times when
                  the splendid scenery of his mountain-fastness, its inspiring air, its wild
                  eagle-like grandeur, independence, and security, gave him a proud contentment, and
                  he looked at his sword and loved it as a bride. But then again there were moods in
                  which he felt all that yearning and disquiet of soul which the man of wide and
                  tender moral organization must feel who has had his faith shaken in the religion
                  of his fathers. To such a man the quarrel with his childhood's faith is a
                  never-ending anguish; especially is it so with a religion so objective, so
                  pictorial, and so interwoven with the whole physical and nervous nature of man, as
                  that which grew up and flowered in modern Italy.</p>
               <p>Agostino was like a man who lives in an eternal struggle of
                  self-justification,—his reason forever going over and over with its plea before
                  his regretful and never-satisfied heart, which was drawn every hour of the day by
                  some chain of memory towards the faith whose visible administrators he detested
                  with the whole force of his moral being. When the vesper-bell, with its plaintive
                  call, rose amid the purple shadows of the olive-silvered mountains,—when the
                  distant voices of chanting priest and choir reached him solemnly from afar,—when
                  he looked into a church with its cloudy pictures of angels, and its window-panes
                  flaming with venerable forms of saints and martyrs,—it roused a yearning anguish,
                  a pain and conflict, which all the efforts of his reason could not subdue. How to
                  be a Christian and yet defy the authorized Head of the Christian Church, or how to
                  be a Christian and recognize foul men of obscene and rapacious deeds as Christ's
                  representatives, was the inextricable Gordian knot, which his sword could not
                  divide. He dared not approach the Sacrament, he dared not pray, and sometimes he
                  felt wild impulses to tread down in riotous despair every fragment of a religious
                  belief which seemed to live in his heart only to torture him. He had heard priests
                  scoff over the wafer they consecrated,—he had known them to mingle poison for
                  rivals in the sacramental wine,—and yet God had kept silence and not struck them
                  dead; and like the Psalmist of old he said, "Verily, I have cleansed my heart in
                  vain, and washed my hands in innocency. Is there a God that judgeth in the
                  earth?"</p>
               <p>The first time he saw Agnes bending like a flower in the slanting evening sunbeams
                  by the old gate of Sorrento, while he stood looking down the kneeling street and
                  striving to hold his own soul in the sarcastic calm of utter indifference, he felt
                  himself struck to the heart by an influence he could not define. The sight of that
                  young face, with its clear, beautiful lines, and its tender fervor, recalled a
                  thousand influences of the happiest and purest hours of his life, and drew him
                  with an attraction he vainly strove to hide under an air of mocking gallantry.</p>
               <p>When she looked him in the face with such grave, surprised eyes of innocent
                  confidence, and promised to pray for him, he felt a remorseful tenderness as if he
                  had profaned a shrine. All that was passionate, poetic, and romantic in his nature
                  was awakened to blend itself in a strange mingling of despairing sadness and of
                  tender veneration about this sweet image of perfect purity and faith. Never does
                  love strike<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7945-00000062"/> so deep and immediate a
                  root as in a sorrowful and desolated nature; there it has nothing to dispute the
                  soil, and soon fills it with its interlacing fibres.</p>
               <p>In this case it was not merely Agnes that he sighed for, but she stood to him as
                  the fair symbol of that life-peace, that rest of soul which he had lost, it seemed
                  to him, forever.</p>
               <p>"Behold this pure, believing child," he said to himself,—"a true member of that
                  blessed Church to which thou art a rebel! How peacefully this lamb walketh the old
                  ways trodden by saints and martyrs, while thou art an infidel and unbeliever!" And
                  then a stern voice within him answered,—"What then? Is the Holy Ghost indeed alone
                  dispensed through the medium of Alexander and his scarlet crew of cardinals? Hath
                  the power to bind and loose in Christ's Church been indeed given to whoever can
                  buy it with the wages of robbery and oppression? Why does every prayer and pious
                  word of the faithful reproach me? Why is God silent? Or is there any God? Oh,
                  Agnes, Agnes! dear lily! fair lamb! lead a sinner into the green pastures where
                  thou restest!"</p>
               <p>So wrestled the strong nature, tempest-tossed in its strength,—so slept the
                  trustful, blessed in its trust,—then in Italy, as now in all lands.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE INTERVIEW.</head>
               <p>THE dreams of Agnes, on the night after her conversation with the monk and her
                  singular momentary interview with the cavalier, were a strange mixture of images,
                  indicating the peculiarities of her education and habits of daily thought.</p>
               <p>She dreamed that she was sitting alone in the moonlight, and heard some one
                  rustling in the distant foliage of the orange-groves, and from them came a young
                  man dressed in white of a dazzling clearness like sunlight; large pearly wings
                  fell from his shoulders and seemed to shimmer with a phosphoric radiance; his
                  forehead was broad and grave, and above it floated a thin, tremulous tongue of
                  flame; his eyes had that deep, mysterious gravity which is so well expressed in
                  all the Florentine paintings of celestial beings: and yet, singularly enough, this
                  white-robed, glorified form seemed to have the features and lineaments of the
                  mysterious cavalier of the evening before,—the same deep, mournful, dark eyes,
                  only that in them the light of earthly pride had given place to the calm, strong
                  gravity of an assured peace,—the same broad forehead,—the same delicately
                  chiselled features, but elevated and etherealized, glowing with a kind of interior
                  ecstasy. He seemed to move from the shadow of the orange-trees with a backward
                  floating of his lustrous garments, as if borne on a cloud just along the surface
                  of the ground; and in his hand he held the lily-spray<pb n="124-125"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000063"/> spray, all radiant with a silvery, living light,
                  just as the monk had suggested to her a divine flower might be. Agnes seemed to
                  herself to hold her breath and marvel with a secret awe, and, as often happens in
                  dreams, she wondered to herself,—"Was this stranger, then, indeed, not even
                  mortal, not even a king's brother, but an angel?—How strange," she said to
                  herself, "that I should never have seen it in his eyes!" Nearer and nearer the
                  vision drew, and touched her forehead with the lily, which seemed dewy and icy
                  cool; and with the contact it seemed to her that a delicious tranquillity, a calm
                  ecstasy, possessed her soul, and the words were impressed in her mind, as if
                  spoken in her ear, "The Lord hath sealed thee for his own!"—and then, with the
                  wild fantasy of dreams, she saw the cavalier in his wonted form and garments, just
                  as he had kneeled to her the night before, and he said, "Oh, Agnes! Agnes! little
                  lamb of Christ, love me and lead me!"—and in her sleep it seemed to her that her
                  heart stirred and throbbed with a strange, new movement in answer to those sad,
                  pleading eyes, and thereafter her dream became more troubled.</p>
               <p>The sea was beginning now to brighten with the reflection of the coming dawn in
                  the sky, and the flickering fire of Vesuvius was waxing sickly and pale; and while
                  all the high points of rocks were turning of a rosy purple, in the weird depths of
                  the gorge were yet the unbroken shadows and stillness of night. But at the
                  earliest peep of dawn the monk had risen, and now, as he paced up and down the
                  little garden, his morning hymn mingled with Agnes's dreams,—words strong with all
                  the nerve of the old Latin, which, when they were written, had scarcely ceased to
                  be the spoken tongue of Italy.<q>

               <p>The hymn in every word well expressed the character and habitual pose of mind of
                  the singer, whose views of<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7945-00000064"/> earthly
                  matters were as different from the views of ordinary working mortals as those of a
                  bird, as he flits and perches and sings, must be from those of the four-footed ox
                  who plods. The "<foreign xml:lang="LAT">sobriam ebrietatem spiritus</foreign>" was
                  with him first constitutional, as a child of sunny skies, and then cultivated by
                  every employment and duty of the religious and artistic career to which from
                  childhood he had devoted himself. If perfect, unalloyed happiness has ever existed
                  in this weary, work-day world of ours, it has been in the bosoms of some of those
                  old religious artists of the Middle Ages, whose thoughts grew and flowered in
                  prayerful shadows, bursting into thousands of quaint and fanciful blossoms on the
                  pages of missal and breviary. In them the fine life of color, form, and symmetry,
                  which is the gift of the Italian, formed a rich stock on which to graft the true
                  vine of religious faith, and rare and fervid were the blossoms.</p>
               <p>For it must be remarked in justice of the Christian religion, that the Italian
                  people never rose to the honors of originality in the beautiful arts till inspired
                  by Christianity. The Art of ancient Rome was a second-hand copy of the original
                  and airy Greek,—often clever, but never vivid and self-originating. It is to the
                  religious Art of the Middle Ages, to the Umbrian and Florentine schools
                  particularly, that we look for the peculiar and characteristic flowering of the <q>

                  </q> Italian mind. When the old Greek Art revived again in modern Europe, though
                  at first it seemed to add richness and grace to this peculiar development, it
                  smothered and killed it at last, as some brilliant tropical parasite exhausts the
                  life of the tree it seems at first to adorn. Raphael and Michel Angelo mark both
                  the perfected splendor and the commenced decline of original Italian Art; and just
                  in proportion as their ideas grew less Christian and more Greek did the peculiar
                  vividness and intense flavor of Italian nationality pass away from them. They
                  became again like the ancient Romans, gigantic imitators and clever copyists,
                  instead of inspired kings and priests of a national development.</p>
               <p>The tones of the monk's morning hymn awakened both Agnes and Elsie, and the latter
                  was on the alert instantly.</p>
               <p>"Bless my soul!" she said, "brother Antonio has a marvellous power of lungs; he is
                  at it the first thing in the morning. It always used to be so; when he was a boy,
                  he would wake me up before daylight singing."</p>
               <p>"He is happy, like the birds," said Agnes, "because he flies near heaven."</p>
               <p>"Like enough: he was always a pious boy; his prayers and his pencil were ever
                  uppermost: but he was a poor hand at work: he could draw you an olive-tree on
                  paper; but set him to dress it, and any fool would have done better."</p>
               <p>The morning rites of devotion and the simple repast being over, Elsie prepared to
                  go to her business. It had occurred to her that the visit of her brother was an
                  admirable pretext for withdrawing Agnes from the scene of her daily traffic, and
                  of course, as she fondly supposed, keeping her from the sight of the suspected
                  admirer.</p>
               <p>Neither Agnes nor the monk had disturbed her serenity<pb n="128-129"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000065"/> by recounting the adventure of the evening before.
                  Agnes had been silent from the habitual reserve which a difference of nature ever
                  placed between her and her grandmother,—a difference which made confidence on her
                  side an utter impossibility. There are natures which ever must be silent to other
                  natures, because there is no common language between them. In the same house, at
                  the same board, sharing the same pillow even, are those forever strangers and
                  foreigners, whose whole stock of intercourse is limited to a few brief phrases on
                  the commonest material wants of life, and who, as soon as they try to go farther,
                  have no words that are mutually understood.</p>
               <p>"Agnes," said her grandmother, "I shall not need you at the stand to-day. There is
                  that new flax to be spun, and you may keep company with your uncle. I'll warrant
                  me, you'll be glad enough of that!"</p>
               <p>"Certainly I shall," said Agnes, cheerfully. "Uncle's comings are my
                  holidays."</p>
               <p>"I will show you somewhat further on my Breviary," said the monk. "Praised be God,
                  many new ideas sprang up in my mind last night, and seemed to shoot forth in
                  blossoms. Even my dreams have often been made fruitful in this divine work."</p>
               <p>"Many a good thought comes in dreams," said Elsie; "but, for my part, I work too
                  hard and sleep too sound to get much that way."</p>
               <p>"Well, brother," said Elsie, after breakfast, "you must look well after Agnes
                  to-day; for there be plenty of wolves go round, hunting these little lambs."</p>
               <p>"Have no fear, sister," said the monk, tranquilly; "the angels have her in charge.
                  If our eyes were only clear-sighted, we should see that Christ's little ones are
                  never alone."</p>
               <p>"All that is fine talk, brother; but I never found that the angels attended to any
                  of my affairs, unless I looked after them pretty sharp myself; and as for girls,
                  the dear Lord knows they need a legion apiece to look after them. What with
                  roystering fellows and smooth-tongued gallants, and with silly, empty-headed
                  hussies like that Giulietta, one has much ado to keep the best of them straight.
                  Agnes is one of the best, too,—a well-brought up, pious, obedient girl, and
                  industrious as a bee. Happy is the husband who gets her. I would I knew a man good
                  enough for her."</p>
               <p>This conversation took place while Agnes was in the garden picking oranges and
                  lemons, and filling the basket which her grandmother was to take to the town. The
                  silver ripple of a hymn that she was singing came through the open door; it was
                  part of a sacred ballad in honor of Saint Agnes:— <q>

                        <l rend="ti-1">That speaks of Him who died for me.</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Hear you now, sister," said the monk, "how the Lord keeps the door of this
                  maiden's heart? There is no fear of her; and I much doubt, sister, whether you
                  would do well to interfere with the evident call this child hath to devote herself
                  wholly to the Lord."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you talk, brother Antonio, who never had a child in your life, and don't know
                  how a mother's heart warms towards her children and her children's children! The
                     saints,<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7945-00000066"/> as I said, must be
                  reasonable, and ought n't to be putting vocations into the head of an old woman's
                  only staff and stay; and if they ought n't to, why, then, they won't. Agnes is a
                  pious child, and loves her prayers and hymns; and so she will love her husband,
                  one of these days, as an honest woman should."</p>
               <p>"But you know, sister, that the highest seats in Paradise are reserved for the
                  virgins who follow the Lamb."</p>
               <p>"Maybe so," said Elsie, stiffly; "but the lower seats are good enough for Agnes
                  and me. For my part, I would rather have a little comfort as I go along, and put
                  up with less in Paradise, (may our dear Lady bring us safely there!) say I."</p>
               <p>So saying, Elsie raised the large, square basket of golden fruit to her head, and
                  turned her stately figure towards the scene of her daily labors.</p>
               <p>The monk seated himself on the garden-wall, with his portfolio by his side, and
                  seemed busily sketching and retouching some of his ideas. Agnes wound some
                  silvery-white flax round her distaff, and seated herself near him under an
                  orange-tree; and while her small fingers were twisting the flax, her large,
                  thoughtful eyes were wandering off on the deep blue sea, pondering over and over
                  the strange events of the day before, and the dreams of the night.</p>
               <p>"Dear child," said the monk, "have you thought more of what I said to you?"</p>
               <p>A deep blush suffused her cheek as she answered,—</p>
               <p>"Yes, uncle; and I had a strange dream last night."</p>
               <p>"A dream, my little heart? Come, then, and tell it to its uncle. Dreams are the
                  hushing of the bodily senses, that the eyes of the Spirit may open."</p>
               <p>"Well, then," said Agnes, "I dreamed that I sat pondering as I did last evening in
                  the moonlight, and that an angel came forth from the trees"——</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" said the monk, looking up with interest; "what form had he?"</p>
               <p>"He was a young man, in dazzling white raiment, and his eyes were deep as
                  eternity; and over his forehead was a silver flame, and he bore a lily-stalk in
                  his hand, which was like what you told of, with light in itself."</p>
               <p>"That must have been the holy Gabriel," said the monk, "the angel that came to our
                  blessed Mother. Did he say aught?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, he touched my forehead with the lily, and a sort of cool rest and peace went
                  all through me, and he said, 'The Lord hath sealed thee for his own!'"</p>
               <p>"Even so," said the monk, looking up, and crossing himself devoutly, "by this
                  token I know that my prayers are answered."</p>
               <p>"But, dear uncle," said Agnes, hesitating and blushing painfully, "there was one
                  singular thing about my dream,—this holy angel had yet a strange likeness to the
                  young man that came here last night, so that I could not but marvel at it."</p>
               <p>"It may be that the holy angel took on him in part this likeness to show how
                  glorious a redeemed soul might become, that you might be encouraged to pray. The
                  holy Saint Monica thus saw the blessed Augustine standing clothed in white among
                  the angels while he was yet a worldling and unbeliever, and thereby received the
                  grace to continue her prayers for thirty years, till she saw him a holy bishop.
                  This is a sure sign that this young man, whoever he may be, shall attain Paradise
                  through your prayers. Tell<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7945-00000067"/> me, dear
                  little heart, is this the first angel thou hast seen?"</p>
               <p>"I never dreamed of them before. I have dreamed of our Lady, and Saint Agnes, and
                  Saint Catharine of Siena; and sometimes it seemed that they sat a long time by my
                  bed, and sometimes it seemed that they took me with them away to some beautiful
                  place where the air was full of music, and sometimes they filled my hands with
                  such lovely flowers that when I waked I was ready to weep that they could no more
                  be found. Why, dear uncle, do <emph>you</emph> see angels often?"</p>
               <p>"Not often, dear child, but sometimes a little glimpse. But you should see the
                  pictures of our holy Father Angelico, to whom the angels appeared constantly; for
                  so blessed was the life he lived, that it was more in heaven than on earth. He
                  would never cumber his mind with the things of this world, and would not paint for
                  money, nor for prince's favor; nor would he take places of power and trust in the
                  Church, or else, so great was his piety, they had made a bishop of him; but he
                  kept ever aloof and walked in the shade. He used to say, 'They that would do
                  Christ's work must walk with Christ.' His pictures of angels are indeed wonderful,
                  and their robes are of all dazzling colors, like the rainbow. It is most surely
                  believed among us that he painted to show forth what he saw in heavenly
                  vision."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said Agnes, "how I wish I could see some of these things!"</p>
               <p>"You may well say so, dear child. There is one picture of Paradise painted on
                  gold, and there you may see our Lord in the midst of the heavens crowning his
                  blessed Mother, and all the saints and angels surrounding; and the colors are so
                  bright that they seem like the sunset clouds,—golden, and rosy, and purple, and
                  amethystine, and green like the new, tender leaves of spring: for, you see, the
                  angels are the Lord's flowers and birds that shine and sing to gladden his
                  Paradise, and there is nothing bright on earth that is comparable to them,—so said
                  the blessed Angelico, who saw them. And what seems worthy of note about them is
                  their marvellous lightness, that they seem to float as naturally as the clouds do,
                  and their garments have a divine grace of motion like vapor that curls and wavers
                  in the sun. Their faces, too, are most wonderful; for they seem so full of purity
                  and majesty, and withal humble, with an inexpressible sweetness; for, beyond all
                  others it was given to the holy Angelico to paint the immortal beauty of the
                  soul."</p>
               <p>"It must be a great blessing and favor for you, dear uncle, to see all these
                  things," said Agnes; "I am never tired of hearing you tell of them."</p>
               <p>"There is one little picture," said the monk, "wherein he hath painted the death
                  of our dear Lady; and surely no mortal could ever conceive anything like her sweet
                  dying face, so faint and weak and tender that each man sees his own mother dying
                  there, yet so holy that one feels that it can be no other than the mother of our
                  Lord; and around her stand the disciples mourning; but above is our blessed Lord
                  himself, who receives the parting spirit, as a tender new-born babe, into his
                  bosom: for so the holy painters represented the death of saints, as of a birth in
                  which each soul became a little child of heaven."</p>
               <p>"How great grace must come from such pictures!" said Agnes. "It seems to me that
                  the making of such holy things is one of the most blessed of good works.—Dear
                  uncle," she said, after a pause, "they say that this deep<pb n="134-135"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000068"/> gorge is haunted by evil spirits, who often waylay
                  and bewilder the unwary, especially in the hours of darkness."</p>
               <p>"I should not wonder in the least," said the monk; "for you must know, child, that
                  our beautiful Italy was of old so completely given up and gone over to idolatry
                  that even her very soil casts up fragments of temples and stones that have been
                  polluted. Especially around these shores there is scarcely a spot that hath not
                  been violated in all times by vilenesses and impurities such as the Apostle saith
                  it is a shame even to speak of. These very waters cast up marbles and fragments of
                  colored mosaics from the halls which were polluted with devil-worship and
                  abominable revellings; so that, as the Gospel saith that the evil spirits cast out
                  by Christ walk through waste places, so do they cling to these fragments of their
                  old estate."</p>
               <p>"Well, uncle, I have longed to consecrate the gorge to Christ by having a shrine
                  there, where I might keep a lamp burning."</p>
               <p>"It is a most pious thought, child."</p>
               <p>"And so, dear uncle, I thought that you would undertake the work. There is one
                  Pietro hereabout who is a skilful worker in stone, and was a playfellow of
                  mine,—though of late grandmamma has forbidden me to talk with him,—and I think he
                  would execute it under your direction."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, my little heart, it shall be done," said the monk, cheerfully; "and I
                  will engage to paint a fair picture of our Lady to be within; and I think it would
                  be a good thought to have a pinnacle on the outside, where should stand a statue
                  of Saint Michael with his sword. Saint Michael is a brave and wonderful angel, and
                  all the devils and vile spirits are afraid of him. I will set about the devices
                  to-day."</p>
               <p>And cheerily the good monk began to intone a verse of an old hymn,— <q>

               <p>In such talk and work the day passed away to Agnes; but we will not say that she
                  did not often fall into deep musings on the mysterious visitor of the night
                  before. Often while the good monk was busy at his drawing, the distaff would droop
                  over her knee and her large dark eyes become intently fixed on the ground, as if
                  she were pondering some absorbing subject.</p>
               <p>Little could her literal, hard-working grandmother, or her artistic, simple-minded
                  uncle, or the dreamy Mother Theresa, or her austere confessor, know of the strange
                  forcing process which they were all together uniting to carry on in the mind of
                  this sensitive young girl. Absolutely secluded by her grandmother's watchful care
                  from any actual knowledge and experience of real life, she had no practical tests
                  by which to correct the dreams of that inner world in which she delighted to live
                  and move, and which was peopled with martyrs, saints, and angels, whose deeds were
                  possible or probable only in the most exalted regions of devout poetry.</p>
               <p>So she gave her heart at once and without reserve to an enthusiastic desire for
                  the salvation of the stranger, whom Heaven, she believed, had directed to seek her
                  intercessions; and when the spindle drooped from her hand, and her eyes became
                  fixed on vacancy, she found herself wondering who he might really be, and longing
                  to know yet a little more of him.</p>
               <p>Towards the latter part of the afternoon, a hasty messenger<pb n="136-137"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000069"/> senger came to summon her uncle to administer the
                  last rites to a man who had just fallen from a building, and who, it was feared,
                  might breathe his last unshriven.</p>
               <p>"Dear daughter, I must hasten and carry Christ to this poor sinner," said the
                  monk, hastily putting all his sketches and pencils into her lap. "Have a care of
                  these till I return,—that is my good little one!"</p>
               <p>Agnes carefully arranged the sketches and put them into the book, and then,
                  kneeling before the shrine, began prayers for the soul of the dying man.</p>
               <p>She prayed long and fervently, and so absorbed did she become, that she neither
                  saw nor heard anything that passed around her.</p>
               <p>It was, therefore, with a start of surprise, as she rose from prayer, that she saw
                  the cavalier sitting on one end of the marble sarcophagus, with an air so composed
                  and melancholy that he might have been taken for one of the marble knights that
                  sometimes are found on tombs.</p>
               <p>"You are surprised to see me, dear Agnes," he said, with a calm, slow utterance,
                  like a man who has assumed a position he means fully to justify; "but I have
                  watched day and night, ever since I saw you, to find one moment to speak with you
                  alone."</p>
               <p>"My Lord," said Agnes, "I humbly wait your pleasure. Anything that a poor maiden
                  may rightly do I will endeavor, in all loving duty."</p>
               <p>"Whom do you take me for, Agnes, that you speak thus?" said the cavalier, smiling
                  sadly.</p>
               <p>"Are you not the brother of our gracious King?" said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"No, dear maiden; and if the kind promise you lately made me is founded on this
                  mistake, it may be retracted."</p>
               <p>"No, my Lord," said Agnes,—"though I now know not who you are, yet if in any
                  strait or need you seek such poor prayers as mine, God forbid I should refuse
                  them!"</p>
               <p>"I am, indeed, in strait and need, Agnes; the sun does not shine on a more
                  desolate man than I am,—one more utterly alone in the world; there is no one left
                  to love me. Agnes, can you not love me a little?—let it be ever so little, it
                  shall content me."</p>
               <p>It was the first time that words of this purport had ever been addressed to Agnes;
                  but they were said so simply, so sadly, so tenderly, that they somehow seemed to
                  her the most natural and proper things in the world to be said; and this poor
                  handsome knight, who looked so earnest and sorrowful,—how could she help
                  answering, "Yes?" From her cradle she had always loved everybody and everything,
                  and why should an exception be made in behalf of a very handsome, very strong, yet
                  very gentle and submissive human being, who came and knocked so humbly at the door
                  of her heart? Neither Mary nor the saints had taught her to be hard-hearted.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my Lord," she said, "you may believe that I will love and pray for you; but
                  now, you must leave me, and not come here any more,—because grandmamma would not
                  be willing that I should talk with you, and it would be wrong to disobey her, she
                  is so very good to me."</p>
               <p>"But, dear Agnes," began the cavalier, approaching her, "I have many things to say
                  to you,—I have much to tell you."</p>
               <p>"But I know grandmamma would not be willing," said Agnes; "indeed you must not
                  come here any more."</p>
               <p>"Well, then," said the stranger, "at least you will meet me at some time,—tell me
                  only where."</p>
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7945-00000070"/>
               <p>"I cannot,—indeed, I cannot," said Agnes, distressed and embarrassed. "Even now,
                  if grandmamma knew you were here, she would be so angry."</p>
               <p>"But how can you pray for me, when you know nothing of me?"</p>
               <p>"The dear Lord knoweth you," said Agnes; "and when I speak of you, He will know
                  what you need."</p>
               <p>"Ah, dear child, how fervent is your faith! Alas for me, I have lost the power of
                  prayer! I have lost the believing heart my mother gave me,—my dear mother who is
                  now in heaven."</p>
               <p>"Ah, how can that be?" said Agnes. "Who could lose faith in so dear a Lord as
                  ours, and so loving a mother?"</p>
               <p>"Agnes, dear little lamb, you know nothing of the world; and I should be most
                  wicked to disturb your lovely peace of soul with any sinful doubts. Oh, Agnes,
                  Agnes, I am most miserable, most unworthy!"</p>
               <p>"Dear Sir, should you not cleanse your soul by the holy sacrament of confession,
                  and receive the living Christ within you? For he says, 'Without me ye can do
                  nothing.'"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Agnes, sacrament and prayer are not for such as me! It is only through your
                  pure prayers I can hope for grace."</p>
               <p>"Dear Sir, I have an uncle, a most holy man, and gentle as a lamb. He is of the
                  convent San Marco in Florence, where there is a most holy prophet risen up."</p>
               <p>"Savonarola?" said the cavalier, with flashing eyes.</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is he. You should hear my uncle talk of him, and how blessed his
                  preaching has been to many souls. Dear Sir, come some time to my uncle."</p>
               <p>At this moment the sound of Elsie's voice was heard ascending the path to the
                  gorge outside, talking with Father Antonio, who was returning.</p>
               <p>Both started, and Agnes looked alarmed.</p>
               <p>"Fear nothing, sweet lamb," said the cavalier; "I am gone."</p>
               <p>He kneeled and kissed the hand of Agnes, and disappeared at one bound over the
                  parapet on the side opposite that which they were approaching.</p>
               <p>Agnes hastily composed herself, struggling with that half-guilty feeling which is
                  apt to weigh on a conscientious nature that has been unwittingly drawn to act a
                  part which would be disapproved by those whose good opinion it habitually seeks.
                  The interview had but the more increased her curiosity to know the history of this
                  handsome stranger. Who, then, could he be? What were his troubles? She wished the
                  interview could have been long enough to satisfy her mind on these points. From
                  the richness of his dress, from his air and manner, from the poetry and the jewel
                  that accompanied it, she felt satisfied, that, if not what she supposed, he was at
                  least nobly born, and had shone in some splendid sphere whose habits and ways were
                  far beyond her simple experiences. She felt towards him somewhat of the awe which
                  a person of her condition in life naturally felt toward that brilliant aristocracy
                  which in those days assumed the state of princes, and the members of which were
                  supposed to look down on common mortals from as great a height as the stars regard
                  the humblest flowers of the field.</p>
               <p>"How strange," she thought, "that he should think so much of me! What can he see
                  in me? And how can it be that a great lord, who speaks so gently and is so
                  reverential to a poor girl, and asks prayers so humbly, can be so wicked and
                  unbelieving as he says he is? Dear God, it cannot be that he is an unbeliever; the
                  great Enemy has been permitted to try him, to suggest doubts to him, as he has
                     to<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7945-00000071"/> holy saints before now. How
                  beautifully he spoke about his mother!—tears glittered in his eyes then,—ah, there
                  must be grace there after all!"</p>
               <p>"Well, my little heart," said Elsie, interrupting her reveries, "have you had a
                  pleasant day?"</p>
               <p>"Delightful, grandmamma," said Agnes, blushing deeply with consciousness.</p>
               <p>"Well," said Elsie, with satisfaction, "one thing I know,—I've frightened off that
                  old hawk of a cavalier with his hooked nose. I have n't seen so much as the tip of
                  his shoe-tie to-day. Yesterday he made himself very busy around our stall; but I
                  made him understand that you never would come there again till the coast was
                  clear."</p>
               <p>The monk was busily retouching the sketch of the Virgin of the Annunciation. He
                  looked up, and saw Agnes standing gazing towards the setting sun, the pale olive
                  of her cheek deepening into a crimson flush. His head was too full of his own work
                  to give much heed to the conversation that had passed, but, looking at the glowing
                  face, he said to himself,—</p>
               <p>"Truly, sometimes she might pass for the rose of Sharon as well as the lily of the
                  valley!"</p>
               <p>The moon that evening rose an hour later than the night before, yet found Agnes
                  still on her knees before the sacred shrine, while Elsie, tired, grumbled at the
                  draft on her sleeping-time.</p>
               <p>"Enough is as good as a feast," she remarked between her teeth; still she had,
                  after all, too much secret reverence for her grandchild's piety openly to
                  interrupt her. But in those days, as now, there were the material and the
                  spiritual, the souls who looked only on things that could be seen, touched, and
                  tasted, and souls who looked on the things that were invisible.</p>
               <p>Agnes was pouring out her soul in that kind of yearning, passionate prayer
                  possible to intensely sympathetic people, in which the interests and wants of
                  another seem to annihilate for a time personal consciousness, and make the whole
                  of one's being seem to dissolve in an intense solicitude for something beyond
                  one's self. In such hours prayer ceases to be an act of the will, and resembles
                  more some over-powering influence which floods the soul from without, bearing all
                  its faculties away on its resistless tide.</p>
               <p>Brought up from infancy to feel herself in a constant circle of invisible
                  spiritual agencies, Agnes received this wave of intense feeling as an impulse
                  inspired and breathed into her by some celestial spirit, that thus she should be
                  made an interceding medium for a soul in some unknown strait or peril. For her
                  faith taught her to believe in an infinite struggle of intercession in which all
                  the Church Visible and Invisible were together engaged, and which bound them in
                  living bonds of sympathy to an interceding Redeemer, so that there was no want or
                  woe of human life that had not somewhere its sympathetic heart, and its
                  never-ceasing prayer before the throne of Eternal Love. Whatever may be thought of
                  the actual truth of this belief, it certainly was far more consoling than that
                  intense individualism of modern philosophy which places every soul alone in its
                  life-battle,—scarce even giving it a God to lean upon.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE CONFESSIONAL.</head>
               <p>THE reader, if a person of any common knowledge of human nature, will easily see
                  the direction in which a young, inexperienced, and impressible girl would
                  naturally be tending under all the influences which we perceive to have come upon
                  her.</p>
               <p>But in the religious faith which Agnes professed there was a modifying force,
                  whose power both for good and evil can scarcely be estimated.</p>
               <p>The simple Apostolic direction, "Confess your faults one to another," and the very
                  natural need of personal pastoral guidance and assistance to a soul in its
                  heavenward journey, had in common with many other religious ideas been forced by
                  the volcanic fervor of the Italian nature into a certain exaggerated proposition.
                  Instead of brotherly confession one to another, or the pastoral sympathy of a
                  fatherly elder, the religious mind of the day was instructed in an awful
                  mysterious sacrament of confession, which gave to some human being a divine right
                  to unlock the most secret chambers of the soul, to scrutinize and direct its most
                  veiled and intimate thoughts, and, standing in God's stead, to direct the current
                  of its most sensitive and most mysterious emotions.</p>
               <p>Every young aspirant for perfection in the religious life had to commence by an
                  unreserved surrender of the whole being in blind faith at the feet of some such
                  spiritual director, all whose questions must be answered, and all whose
                  injunctions obeyed, as from God himself. Thenceforward was to be no soul-privacy,
                  no retirement, nothing too sacred to be expressed, too delicate to be handled and
                  analyzed. In reading the lives of those ethereally made and moulded women who have
                  come down to our day canonized as saints in the Roman Catholic communion, one too
                  frequently gets the impression of most regal natures, gifted with all the most
                  divine elements of humanity, but subjected to a constant unnatural pressure from
                  the ceaseless scrutiny and ungenial pertinacity of some inferior and
                  uncomprehending person invested with the authority of a Spiritual Director.</p>
               <p>That there are advantages attending this species of intimate direction, when
                  wisely and skilfully managed, cannot be doubted. Grovelling and imperfect natures
                  have often thus been lifted up and carried in the arms of superior wisdom and
                  purity. The confession administered by a Fénelon or a Francis de Sales was
                  doubtless a beautiful and most invigorating ordinance; but the difficulty in its
                  actual working is the rarity of such superior natures,—the fact, that the most
                  ignorant and most incapable may be invested with precisely the same authority as
                  the most intelligent and skilful.</p>
               <p>He to whom the faith of Agnes obliged her to lay open her whole soul, who had a
                  right with probing-knife and lancet to dissect all the finest nerves and fibres of
                  her womanly nature, was a man who had been through all the wild and desolating
                  experiences incident to a dissipated and irregular life in those turbulent
                  days.</p>
               <p>It is true, that he was now with most stringent and earnest solemnity striving to
                  bring every thought and passion into captivity to the spirit of his sacred vows;
                  but still, when a man has once lost that unconscious soul-purity which exists<pb
                     n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7945-00000073"/> in a mind unscathed by the fires of
                  passion, no after-tears can weep it back again. No penance, no prayer, no anguish
                  of remorse can give back the simplicity of a soul that has never been stained.</p>
               <p>Il Padre Francesco had not failed to make those inquiries into the character of
                  Agnes's mysterious lover which he assumed to be necessary as a matter of pastoral
                  faithfulness.</p>
               <p>It was not difficult for one possessing the secrets of the confessional to learn
                  the real character of any person in the neighborhood, and it was with a kind of
                  bitter satisfaction which rather surprised himself that the father learned enough
                  ill of the cavalier to justify his using every possible measure to prevent his
                  forming any acquaintance with Agnes. He was captain of a band of brigands, and, of
                  course, in array against the State; he was excommunicated, and, of course, an
                  enemy of the Church. What but the vilest designs could be attributed to such a
                  man? Was he not a wolf prowling round the green, secluded pastures where as yet
                  the Lord's lamb had been folded in unconscious innocence?</p>
               <p>Father Francesco, when he next met Agnes at the confessional, put such questions
                  as drew from her the whole account of all that had passed between her and the
                  stranger. The recital on Agnes's part was perfectly translucent and pure, for she
                  had said no word and had had no thought that brought the slightest stain upon her
                  soul. Love and prayer had been the prevailing habit of her life, and in promising
                  to love and pray, she had had no worldly or earthly thought. The language of
                  gallantry, or even of sincere passion, had never reached her ear; but it had
                  always been as natural to her to love every human being as for a plant with
                  tendrils to throw them round the next plant, and therefore she entertained the
                  gentle guest who had lately found room in her heart without a question or a
                  scruple.</p>
               <p>As Agnes related her childlike story of unconscious faith and love, her listener
                  felt himself strangely and bitterly agitated. It was a vision of ignorant purity
                  and unconsciousness rising before him, airy and glowing as a child's soap-bubble,
                  which one touch might annihilate; but he felt a strange remorseful tenderness, a
                  yearning admiration, at its unsubstantial purity. There is something pleading and
                  pitiful in the simplicity of perfect ignorance,—a rare and delicate beauty in its
                  freshness, like the morning-glory cup, which, once withered by the heat, no second
                  morning can restore. Agnes had imparted to her confessor, by a mysterious
                  sympathy, something like the morning freshness of her own soul; she had redeemed
                  the idea of womanhood from gross associations, and set before him a fair ideal of
                  all that female tenderness and purity may teach to man. Her prayers,—well he
                  believed in them,—but he set his teeth with a strange spasm of inward passion,
                  when he thought of her prayers and love being given to another. He tried to
                  persuade himself that this was only the fervor of pastoral zeal against a vile
                  robber who had seized the fairest lamb of the sheepfold; but there was an
                  intensely bitter, miserable feeling connected with it, that scorched and burned
                  his higher aspirations like a stream of lava running among fresh leaves and
                  flowers.</p>
               <p>The conflict of his soul communicated a severity of earnestness to his voice and
                  manner which made Agnes tremble, as he put one probing question after another,
                  designed to awaken some consciousness of sin in her soul. Still, though troubled
                  and distressed by his apparent disapprobation<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000074"/> probation, her answers came always clear, honest,
                  unfaltering, like those of one who <emph>could</emph> not form an idea of
                  evil.</p>
               <p>When the confession was over, he came out of his recess to speak with Agnes a few
                  words face to face. His eyes had a wild and haggard earnestness, and a vivid
                  hectic flush on either cheek told how extreme was his emotion. Agnes lifted her
                  eyes to his with an innocent wondering trouble and an appealing confidence that
                  for a moment wholly unnerved him. He felt a wild impulse to clasp her in his arms;
                  and for a moment it seemed to him he would sacrifice heaven and brave hell, if he
                  could for one moment hold her to his heart, and say that he loved her,—her, the
                  purest, fairest, sweetest revelation of God's love that had ever shone on his
                  soul,—her, the only star, the only flower, the only dew-drop of a burning, barren,
                  weary life. It seemed to him that it was not the longing, gross passion, but the
                  outcry of his whole nature for something noble, sweet, and divine.</p>
               <p>But he turned suddenly away with a sort of groan, and, folding his robe over his
                  face, seemed engaged in earnest prayer. Agnes looked at him awe-struck and
                  breathless.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my father!" she faltered, "what have I done?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, my poor child," said the father, suddenly turning toward her with
                  recovered calmness and dignity; "but I behold in thee a fair lamb whom the roaring
                  lion is seeking to devour. Know, my daughter, that I have made inquiries
                  concerning this man of whom you speak, and find that he is an outlaw and a robber
                  and a heretic,—a vile wretch stained by crimes that have justly drawn down upon
                  him the sentence of excommunication from our Holy Father the Pope."</p>
               <p>Agnes grew deadly pale at this announcement.</p>
               <p>"Can it be possible?" she gasped. "Alas! what dreadful temptations have driven him
                  to such sins?"</p>
               <p>"Daughter, beware how you think too lightly of them, or suffer his good looks and
                  flattering words to blind you to their horror. You must from your heart detest him
                  as a vile enemy."</p>
               <p>"Must I, my father?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed you must."</p>
               <p>"But if the dear Lord loved us and died for us when we were his enemies, may we
                  not pity and pray for unbelievers? Oh, say, my dear father, is it not allowed to
                  us to pray for all sinners, even the vilest?"</p>
               <p>"I do not say that you may not, my daughter," said the monk, too conscientious to
                  resist the force of this direct appeal; "but, daughter," he added, with an energy
                  that alarmed Agnes, "you must watch your heart; you must not suffer your interest
                  to become a worldly love: remember that you are chosen to be the espoused of
                  Christ alone."</p>
               <p>While the monk was speaking thus, Agnes fixed on him her eyes with an innocent
                  mixture of surprise and perplexity, which gradually deepened into a strong gravity
                  of gaze, as if she were looking through him, through all visible things into some
                  far-off depth of mysterious knowledge.</p>
               <p>"My Lord will keep me," she said; "my soul is safe in His heart as a little bird
                  in its nest; but while I love Him, I cannot help loving everybody whom He loves,
                  even His enemies: and, father, my heart prays within me for this poor sinner,
                  whether I will or no; something within me continually intercedes for him."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Agnes! Agnes! blessed child, pray for me also," said the monk, with a sudden
                  burst of emotion which perfectly confounded his disciple. He hid his face with his
                  hands.</p>
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7945-00000075"/>
               <p>"My blessed father!" said Agnes, "how could I deem that holiness like yours had
                  any need of my prayers?"</p>
               <p>"Child! child! you know nothing of me. I am a miserable sinner, tempted of devils,
                  in danger of damnation."</p>
               <p>Agnes stood appalled at this sudden burst, so different from the rigid and
                  restrained severity of tone in which the greater part of the conversation had been
                  conducted. She stood silent and troubled; while he, whom she had always regarded
                  with such awful veneration, seemed shaken by some internal whirlwind of emotion
                  whose nature she could not comprehend.</p>
               <p>At length Father Francesco raised his head, and recovered his wonted calm severity
                  of expression.</p>
               <p>"My daughter," he said, "little do the innocent lambs of the flock know of the
                  dangers and conflicts through which the shepherds must pass who keep the Lord's
                  fold. We have the labors of angels laid upon us, and we are but men. Often we
                  stumble, often we faint, and Satan takes advantage of our weakness. I cannot
                  confer with you now as I would; but, my child, listen to my directions. Shun this
                  young man; let nothing ever lead you to listen to another word from him; you must
                  not even look at him, should you meet, but turn away your head and repeat a
                  prayer. I do not forbid you to practise the holy work of intercession for his
                  soul, but it must be on these conditions."</p>
               <p>"My father," said Agnes, "you may rely on my obedience"; and, kneeling, she kissed
                  his hand.</p>
               <p>He drew it suddenly away, with a gesture of pain and displeasure.</p>
               <p>"Pardon a sinful child this liberty," said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"You know not what you do," said the father, hastily. "Go, my daughter,—go at
                  once; I will confer with you some other time;" and hastily raising his hand in an
                  attitude of benediction, he turned and went into the confessional.</p>
               <p>"Wretch! hypocrite! whited sepulchre!" he said to himself,—"to warn this innocent
                  child against a sin that is all the while burning in my own bosom! Yes, I do love
                  her,—I do! I, that warn her against earthly love, I would plunge into hell itself
                  to win hers! And yet, when I know that the care of her soul is only a temptation
                  and a snare to me, I cannot, will not give her up! No, I cannot!—no, I will not!
                  Why should I <emph>not</emph> love her? Is she not pure as Mary herself? Ah,
                  blessed is he whom such a woman leads! And I—I—have condemned myself to the
                  society of swinish, ignorant, stupid monks,—I must know no such divine souls, no
                  such sweet communion! Help me, blessed Mary!—help a miserable sinner!"</p>
               <p>Agnes left the confessional perplexed and sorrowful. The pale, proud, serious face
                  of the cavalier seemed to look at her imploringly, and she thought of him now with
                  the pathetic interest we give to something noble and great exposed to some fatal
                  danger. "Could the sacrifice of my whole life," she thought, "rescue this noble
                  soul from perdition, then I shall not have lived in vain. I am a poor little girl;
                  nobody knows whether I live or die. He is a strong and powerful man, and many must
                  stand or fall with him. Blessed be the Lord that gives to his lowly ones a power
                  to work in secret places! How blessed should I be to meet him in Paradise, all
                  splendid as I saw him in my dream! Oh, that would be worth living for,—worth dying
                  for!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <head type="sub">PERPLEXITIES.</head>
               <p>AGNES returned from the confessional with more sadness than her simple life had
                  ever known before. The agitation of her confessor, the tremulous eagerness of his
                  words, the alternations of severity and tenderness in his manner to her, all
                  struck her only as indications of the very grave danger in which she was placed,
                  and the awfulness of the sin and condemnation which oppressed the soul of one for
                  whom she was conscious of a deep and strange interest.</p>
               <p>She had the undoubting, uninquiring reverence which a Christianly educated child
                  of those times might entertain for the visible head of the Christian Church, all
                  whose doings were to be regarded with an awful veneration which never even raised
                  a question.</p>
               <p>That the Papal throne was now filled by a man who had bought his election with the
                  wages of iniquity, and dispensed its powers and offices with sole reference to the
                  aggrandizement of a family proverbial for brutality and obscenity, was a fact well
                  known to the reasoning and enlightened orders of society at this time; but it did
                  not penetrate into those lowly valleys where the sheep of the Lord humbly
                  pastured, innocently unconscious of the frauds and violence by which their dearest
                  interests were bought and sold.</p>
               <p>The Christian faith we now hold, who boast our enlightened ened Protestantism, has
                  been transmitted to us through the hearts and hands of such,—who, while princes
                  wrangled with Pope, and Pope with princes, knew nothing of it all, but in lowly
                  ways of prayer and patient labor, were one with us of modern times in the great
                  central belief of the Christian heart, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain."</p>
               <p>As Agnes came slowly up the path towards the little garden, she was conscious of a
                  burden and weariness of spirit she had never known before. She passed the little
                  moist grotto, which in former times she never failed to visit to see if there were
                  any new-blown cyclamen, without giving it even a thought. A crimson spray of
                  gladiolus leaned from the rock and seemed softly to kiss her cheek, yet she
                  regarded it not; and once stopping and gazing abstractedly upward on the
                  flower-tapestried walls of the gorge, as they rose in wreath and garland and
                  festoon above her, she felt as if the brilliant yellow of the broom and the
                  crimson of the gillyflowers, and all the fluttering, nodding armies of brightness
                  that were dancing in the sunlight, were too gay for such a world as this, where
                  mortal sins and sorrows made such havoc with all that seemed brightest and best,
                  and she longed to fly away and be at rest.</p>
               <p>Just then she heard the cheerful voice of her uncle in the little garden above, as
                  he was singing at his painting. The words were those of that old Latin hymn of
                  Saint Bernard, which, in its English dress, has thrilled many a Methodist
                  class-meeting and many a Puritan conference, telling, in the welcome they meet in
                  each Christian soul, that there is a unity in Christ's Church which is not
                  outward,—a secret, invisible bond, by which, under warring names and badges of
                  opposition, His true followers have yet been one in Him, even though they
                  discerned it not.</p>

                  </note>The old monk sang with all his heart; and his voice, which had been a fine
                  one in its day, had still that power which comes from the expression of deep
                  feeling. One often hears this peculiarity in the voices of persons of genius and
                  sensibility, even when destitute of any real critical merit. They seem to be so
                  interfused with the emotions of the soul, that they strike upon the heart almost
                  like the living touch of a spirit.</p>
               <p>Agnes was soothed in listening to him. The Latin words, the sentiment of which had
                  been traditional in the Church from time immemorial, had to her a sacred fragrance
                  and odor; they were words apart from all common usage, a sacramental language,
                  never heard but in moments of devotion and aspiration,—and they stilled the
                  child's heart in its tossings and tempest, as when of old the Jesus they spake of
                  walked forth on the stormy sea.</p>

               <p>"What, my little one!" said the monk, looking over the wall; "I thought I heard
                  angels singing. Is it not a beautiful morning?"</p>
               <p>"Dear uncle, it is," said Agnes. "And I have been so glad to hear your beautiful
                  hymn!—it comforted me."</p>
               <p>"Comforted you, little heart? What a word is that! When you get as far along on
                  your journey as your old uncle, then you may talk of <emph>comfort</emph>. But who
                  thinks of comforting birds or butterflies or young lambs?"</p>
               <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7945-00000078"/>
               <p>"Ah, dear uncle, I am not so very happy," said Agnes, the tears starting into her
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>"Not happy?" said the monk, looking up from his drawing. "Pray, what's the matter
                  now? Has a bee stung your finger? or have you lost your nosegay over a rock? or
                  what dreadful affliction has come upon you?—hey, my little heart?"</p>
               <p>Agnes sat down on the corner of the marble fountain, and, covering her face with
                  her apron, sobbed as if her heart would break.</p>
               <p>"What has that old priest been saying to her in the confession?" said Father
                  Antonio to himself. "I dare say he cannot understand her. She is as pure as a
                  dew-drop on a cobweb, and as delicate; and these priests, half of them don't know
                  how to handle the Lord's lambs.—Come now, little Agnes," he said, with a coaxing
                  tone, "what is its trouble?—tell its old uncle,—there's a dear!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, uncle, I can't!" said Agnes, between her sobs.</p>
               <p>"Can't tell its uncle!—there's a pretty go! Perhaps you will tell grandmamma?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, no, no! not for the world!" said Agnes, sobbing still more bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Why, really, little heart of mine, this is getting serious," said the monk; "let
                  your old uncle try to help you."</p>
               <p>"It is n't for myself," said Agnes, endeavoring to check her feelings,—"it is not
                  for myself,—it is for another,—for a soul lost. Ah, my Jesus, have mercy!"</p>
               <p>"A soul lost? Our Mother forbid!" said the monk, crossing himself. "Lost in this
                  Christian land, so overflowing with the beauty of the Lord?—lost out of this fair
                  sheepfold of Paradise?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, lost," said Agnes, despairingly,—"and if somebody body do not save him, lost
                  forever; and it is a brave and noble soul, too,—like one of the angels that
                  fell."</p>
               <p>"Who is it dear?—tell me about it," said the monk. "I am one of the shepherds
                  whose place it is to go after that which is lost, even till I find it."</p>
               <p>"Dear uncle, you remember the youth who suddenly appeared to us in the moonlight
                  here a few evenings ago?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, indeed!" said the monk,—"what of him?"</p>
               <p>"Father Francesco has told me dreadful things of him this morning."</p>
               <p>"What things?"</p>
               <p>"Uncle, he is excommunicated by our Holy Father the Pope."</p>
               <p>Father Antonio, as a member of one of the most enlightened and cultivated
                  religious orders of the times, and as an intimate companion and disciple of
                  Savonarola, had a full understanding of the character of the reigning Pope, and
                  therefore had his own private opinion of how much his excommunication was likely
                  to be worth in the invisible world. He knew that the same doom had been threatened
                  towards his saintly master, for opposing and exposing the scandalous vices which
                  disgraced the high places of the Church; so that, on the whole, when he heard that
                  this young man was excommunicated, so far from being impressed with horror towards
                  him, he conceived the idea that he might be a particularly honest fellow and good
                  Christian. But then he did not hold it wise to disturb the faith of the
                  simple-hearted by revealing to them the truth about the head of the Church on
                  earth.</p>
               <p>While the disorders in those elevated regions filled the minds of the intelligent
                  classes with apprehension and alarm,<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7945-00000079"/>
                  they held it unwise to disturb the trustful simplicity of the lower orders, whose
                  faith in Christianity itself they supposed might thus be shaken. In fact, they
                  were themselves somewhat puzzled how to reconcile the patent and manifest fact,
                  that the actual incumbent of the Holy See was not under the guidance of any
                  spirit, unless it were a diabolical one, with the theory which supposed an
                  infallible guidance of the Holy Spirit to attend as a matter of course on that
                  position. Some of the boldest of them did not hesitate to declare that the Holy
                  City had suffered a foul invasion, and that a false usurper reigned in her sacred
                  palaces in place of the Father of Christendom. The greater part did as people now
                  do with the mysteries and discrepancies of a faith which on the whole they revere:
                  they turned their attention from the vexed question, and sighed and longed for
                  better days.</p>
               <p>Father Antonio did not, therefore, tell Agnes that the announcement which had
                  filled her with such distress was far less conclusive with himself of the ill
                  desert of the individual to whom it related.</p>
               <p>"My little heart," he answered, gravely, "did you learn the sin for which this
                  young man was excommunicated?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, me! my dear uncle, I fear he is an infidel,—an unbeliever. Indeed, now I
                  remember it, he confessed as much to me the other day."</p>
               <p>"Where did he tell you this?"</p>
               <p>"You remember, my uncle, when you were sent for to the dying man? When you were
                  gone, I kneeled down to pray for his soul; and when I rose from prayer, this young
                  cavalier was sitting right here, on this end of the fountain. He was looking
                  fixedly at me, with such sad eyes, so full of longing and pain, that it was quite
                  piteous; and he spoke to me so sadly, I could not but pity him."</p>
               <p>"What did he say to you, child?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, father, he said that he was all alone in the world, without friends, and
                  utterly desolate, with no one to love him; but worse than that, he said he had
                  lost his faith, that he could not believe."</p>
               <p>"What did you say to him?"</p>
               <p>"Uncle, I tried, as a poor girl might, to do him some good. I prayed him to
                  confess and take the sacrament; but he looked almost fierce when I said so. And
                  yet I cannot but think, after all, that he has not lost all grace, because he
                  begged me so earnestly to pray for him; he said his prayers could do no good, and
                  wanted mine. And then I began to tell him about you, dear uncle, and how you came
                  from that blessed convent in Florence, and about your master Savonarola; and that
                  seemed to interest him, for he looked quite excited, and spoke the name over, as
                  if it were one he had heard before. I wanted to urge him to come and open his case
                  to you; and I think perhaps I might have succeeded, but that just then you and
                  grandmamma came up the path; and when I heard you coming, I begged him to go,
                  because you know grandmamma would be very angry, if she knew that I had given
                  speech to a man, even for a few moments; she thinks men are so dreadful."</p>
               <p>"I must seek this youth," said the monk, in a musing tone; "perhaps I may find out
                  what inward temptation hath driven him away from the fold."</p>
               <p>"Oh, do, dear uncle! do!" said Agnes, earnestly. "I am sure that he has been
                  grievously tempted and misled, for he seems to have a noble and gentle nature; and
                  he spoke so feelingly of his mother, who is a saint in heaven; and he seemed so
                  earnestly to long to return to the bosom of the Church."</p>
               <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7945-00000080"/>
               <p>"The Church is a tender mother to all her erring children," said the monk.</p>
               <p>"And don't you think that our dear Holy Father the Pope will forgive him?" said
                  Agnes. "Surely, he will have all the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who would
                  rejoice in one sheep found more than in all the ninety-and-nine who went not
                  astray."</p>
               <p>The monk could scarcely repress a smile at imagining Alexander the Sixth in this
                  character of a good shepherd, as Agnes's enthusiastic imagination painted the head
                  of the Church; and then he gave an inward sigh, and said, softly, "Lord, how
                  long?"</p>
               <p>"I think," said Agnes, "that this young man is of noble birth, for his words and
                  his bearing and his tones of voice are not those of common men; even though he
                  speaks so humbly and gently, there is yet something princely that looks out of his
                  eyes, as if he were born to command; and he wears strange jewels, the like of
                  which I never saw, on his hands and at the hilt of his dagger,—yet he seems to
                  make nothing of them. But yet, I know not why, he spoke of himself as one utterly
                  desolate and forlorn. Father Francesco told me that he was captain of a band of
                  robbers who live in the mountains. One cannot think it is so."</p>
               <p>"Little heart," said the monk tenderly, "you can scarcely know what things befall
                  men in these distracted times, when faction wages war with faction, and men
                  pillage and burn and imprison, first on this side, then on that. Many a son of a
                  noble house may find himself homeless and landless, and, chased by the enemy, may
                  have no refuge but the fastnesses of the mountains. Thank God, our lovely Italy
                  hath a noble backbone of these same mountains, which afford shelter to her
                  children in their straits."</p>
               <p>"Then you think it possible, dear uncle, that this may not be a bad man, after
                  all?"</p>
               <p>"Let us hope so, child. I will myself seek him out; and if his mind have been
                  chafed by violence or injustice, I will strive to bring him back into the good
                  ways of the Lord. Take heart, my little one,—all will yet be well. Come now,
                  little darling, wipe your bright eyes, and look at these plans I have been making
                  for the shrine we were talking of, in the gorge. See here, I have drawn a goodly
                  arch with a pinnacle. Under the arch, you see, shall be the picture of our Lady
                  with the blessed Babe. The arch shall be cunningly sculptured with vines of ivy
                  and passion-flower; and on one side of it shall stand Saint Agnes with her
                  lamb,—and on the other, Saint Cecilia, crowned with roses; and on this pinnacle,
                  above all, Saint Michael, all in armor, shall stand leaning,—one hand on his
                  sword, and holding a shield with the cross upon it."</p>
               <p>"Ah, that will be beautiful!" said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"You can scarcely tell," pursued the monk, "from this faint drawing, what the
                  picture of our Lady is to be; but I shall paint her to the highest of my art, and
                  with many prayers that I may work worthily. You see, she shall be standing on a
                  cloud with a background all of burnished gold, like the streets of the New
                  Jerusalem; and she shall be clothed in a mantle of purest blue from head to foot,
                  to represent the unclouded sky of summer; and on her forehead she shall wear the
                  evening star, which ever shineth when we say the Ave Maria; and all the borders of
                  her blue vesture shall be cunningly wrought with fringes of stars; and the dear
                  Babe shall lean his little cheek to hers so peacefully, and there shall be a clear
                  shining of love through her face, and a heavenly restfulness, that it shall do
                  one's heart<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7945-00000081"/> good to look at her. Many a
                  blessed hour shall I have over this picture,—many a hymn shall I sing as my work
                  goes on. I must go about to prepare the panels forthwith; and it were well, if
                  there be that young man who works in stone, to have him summoned to our
                  conference."</p>
               <p>"I think," said Agnes, "that you will find him in the town; he dwells next to the
                  cathedral."</p>
               <p>"I trust he is a youth of pious life and conversation," said the monk. "I must
                  call on him this afternoon; for he ought to be stirring himself up by hymns and
                  prayers, and by meditations on the beauty of saints and angels, for so goodly a
                  work. What higher honor or grace can befall a creature than to be called upon to
                  make visible to men that beauty of invisible things which is divine and eternal?
                  How many holy men have given themselves to this work in Italy, till, from being
                  overrun with heathen temples, it is now full of most curious and wonderful
                  churches, shrines, and cathedrals, every stone of which is a miracle of beauty! I
                  would, dear daughter, you could see our great Duomo in Florence, which is a
                  mountain of precious marbles and many-colored mosaics; and the Campanile that
                  riseth thereby is like a lily of Paradise,—so tall, so stately, with such an
                  infinite grace, and adorned all the way up with holy emblems and images of saints
                  and angels; nor is there any part of it, within or without, that is not finished
                  sacredly with care, as an offering to the most perfect God. Truly, our fair
                  Florence, though she be little, is worthy, by her sacred adornments, to be worn as
                  the lily of our Lady's girdle, even as she hath been dedicated to her."</p>
               <p>Agnes seemed pleased with the enthusiastic discourse of her uncle. The tears
                  gradually dried from her eyes as she listened to him, and the hope so natural to
                  the young and untried heart began to reassert itself. God was merciful, the world
                  beautiful; there was a tender Mother, a reigning Saviour, protecting angels and
                  guardian saints: surely, then, there was no need to despair of the recall of any
                  wanderer; and the softest supplication of the most ignorant and unworthy would be
                  taken up by so many sympathetic voices in the invisible world, and borne on in so
                  many waves of brightness to the heavenly throne, that the most timid must have
                  hope in prayer.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon, the monk went to the town to seek the young artist, and also to
                  inquire for the stranger for whom his pastoral offices were in requisition, and
                  Agnes remained alone in the little solitary garden.</p>
               <p>It was one of those rich slumberous afternoons of spring that seem to bathe earth
                  and heaven with an Elysian softness; and from her little lonely nook shrouded in
                  dusky shadows by its orange-trees, Agnes looked down the sombre gorge to where the
                  open sea lay panting and palpitating in blue and violet waves, while the little
                  white sails of fishing-boats drifted hither and thither, now silvered in the
                  sunshine, now fading away like a dream into the violet vapor bands that mantled
                  the horizon. The weather would have been oppressively sultry but for the gentle
                  breeze which constantly drifted landward with coolness in its wings. The hum of
                  the old town came to her ear softened by distance and mingled with the patter of
                  the fountain and the music of birds singing in the trees overhead. Agnes tried to
                  busy herself with her spinning; but her mind constantly wandered away, and stirred
                  and undulated with a thousand dim and unshaped thoughts and emotions, of which she
                  vaguely questioned in her own mind. Why did Father Francesco warn her so solemnly
                  against an earthly love? Did he not<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7945-00000082"/>
                  know her vocation? But still he was wisest and must know best; there must be
                  danger, if he said so. But then, this knight had spoken so modestly, so humbly,—so
                  differently from Giulietta's lovers!—for Giulietta had sometimes found a chance to
                  recount to Agnes some of her triumphs. How could it be that a knight so brave and
                  gentle, and so piously brought up, should become an infidel? Ah, uncle Antonio was
                  right,—he must have had some foul wrong, some dreadful injury! When Agnes was a
                  child, in travelling with her grandmother through one of the highest passes of the
                  Apennines, she had chanced to discover a wounded eagle, whom an arrow had pierced,
                  sitting all alone by himself on a rock, with his feathers ruffled, and a film
                  coming over his great, clear, bright eye,—and, ever full of compassion, she had
                  taken him to nurse, and had travelled for a day with him in her arms; and the
                  mournful look of his regal eyes now came into her memory. "Yes," she said to
                  herself, "he is like my poor eagle! The archers have wounded him, so that he is
                  glad to find shelter even with a poor maid like me; but it was easy to see my
                  eagle had been king among birds, even as this knight is among men. Certainly, God
                  must love him,—he is so beautiful and noble! I hope dear uncle will find him this
                  afternoon; he knows how to teach him;—as for me, I can only pray."</p>
               <p>Such were the thoughts that Agnes twisted into the shining white flax, while her
                  eyes wandered dreamily over the soft hazy landscape. At last, lulled by the
                  shivering sound of leaves, and the bird-songs, and wearied with the agitations of
                  the morning, her head lay back against the end of the sculptured fountain, the
                  spindle slowly dropped from her hand, and her eyes were closed in sleep, the
                  murmur of the fountain still sounding in her dreams. In her dreams she seemed to
                  be wandering far away among the purple passes of the Apennines, where she had come
                  years ago when she was a little girl; with her grandmother she pushed through old
                  olive-groves, weird and twisted with many a quaint gnarl, and rustling their pale
                  silvery leaves in noonday twilight. Sometimes she seemed to carry in her bosom a
                  wounded eagle, and often she sat down to stroke it and to try to give it food from
                  her hand, and as often it looked upon her with a proud, patient eye, and then her
                  grandmother seemed to shake her roughly by the arm and bid her throw the silly
                  bird away;—but then again the dream changed, and she saw a knight lie bleeding and
                  dying in a lonely hollow,—his garments torn, his sword broken, and his face pale
                  and faintly streaked with blood; and she kneeled by him, trying in vain to stanch
                  a deadly wound in his side, while he said reproachfully, "Agnes, dear Agnes, why
                  would you not save me?" and then she thought he kissed her hand with his cold
                  dying lips; and she shivered and awoke,—to find that her hand was indeed held in
                  that of the cavalier, whose eyes met her own when first she unclosed them, and the
                  same voice that spoke in her dream said, "Agnes, dear Agnes!"</p>
               <p>For a moment she seemed stupefied and confounded, and sat passively regarding the
                  knight, who kneeled at her feet and repeatedly kissed her hand, calling her his
                  saint, his star, his life, and whatever other fair name poetry lends to love. All
                  at once, however, her face flushed crimson red, she drew her hand quickly away,
                  and, rising up, made a motion to retreat, saying, in a voice of alarm,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, my Lord, this must not be! I am committing deadly sin to hear you. Please,
                  please go! please leave a poor girl!"</p>
               <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7945-00000083"/>
               <p>"Agnes, what does this mean?" said the cavalier. "Only two days since, in this
                  place, you promised to love me; and that promise has brought me from utter despair
                  to love of life. Nay, since you told me that, I have been able to pray once more;
                  the whole world seems changed for me: and now will you take it all away,—you, who
                  are all I have on earth?"</p>
               <p>"My Lord, I did not know then that I was sinning. Our dear Mother knows I said
                  only what I thought was true and right, but I find it was a sin."</p>
               <p>"A sin <emph>to love</emph>, Agnes? Heaven must be full of sin, then; for there
                  they do nothing else."</p>
               <p>"Oh, my Lord, I must not argue with you; I am forbidden to listen even for a
                  moment. Please go. I will never forget you, Sir,—never forget to pray for you, and
                  to love you as they love in heaven; but I am forbidden to speak with you. I fear I
                  have sinned in hearing and saying even this much."</p>
               <p>"Who forbids you, Agnes? Who has the right to forbid your good, kind heart to
                  love, where love is so deeply needed and so gratefully received?"</p>
               <p>"My holy father, whom I am bound to obey as my soul's director," said Agnes; "he
                  has forbidden me so much as to listen to a word, and yet I have listened to many.
                  How could I help it?"</p>
               <p>"Ever these priests!" said the cavalier, his brow darkening with an impatient
                  frown; "wolves in sheep's clothing!"</p>
               <p>"Alas!" said Agnes, sorrowfully, "why will you"——</p>
               <p>"Why will I what?" he said, facing suddenly toward her, and looking down with a
                  fierce, scornful determination.</p>
               <p>"Why will you be at war with the Holy Church? Why will you peril your eternal
                  salvation?"</p>
               <p>"Is there a Holy Church? Where is it? Would there were one! I am blind and cannot
                  see it. Little Agnes, you promised to lead me; but you drop my hand in the
                  darkness. Who will guide me, if <emph>you</emph> will not?"</p>
               <p>"My Lord, I am most unfit to be your guide. I am a poor girl, without any
                  learning; but there is my uncle I spoke to you of. Oh, my Lord, if you only would
                  go to him, he is wise and gentle both. I must go in now, my Lord,—indeed, I must.
                  I must not sin further. I must do a heavy penance for having listened and spoken
                  to you, after the holy father had forbidden me."</p>
               <p>"No, Agnes, you shall <emph>not</emph> go in," said the cavalier, suddenly
                  stepping before her and placing himself across the doorway; "you
                     <emph>shall</emph> see me, and hear me too. I take the sin on myself; you
                  cannot help it. How will you avoid me? Will you fly now down the path of the
                  gorge? I will follow you,—I am desperate. I had but one comfort on earth, but one
                  hope of heaven, and that through you; and you, cruel, are so ready to give me up
                  at the first word of your priest!"</p>
               <p>"God knows if I do it willingly," said Agnes; "but I know it is best; for I feel I
                  should love you too well, if I saw more of you. My Lord, you are strong and can
                  compel me, but I beg you to leave me."</p>
               <p>"Dear Agnes, could you really feel it possible that you might love me too well?"
                  said the cavalier, his whole manner changing. "Ah! could I carry you far away to
                  my home in the mountains, far up in the beautiful blue mountains, where the air is
                  so clear, and the weary, wrangling world lies so far below that one forgets it
                  entirely, you should be my wife, my queen, my express. You should lead me where
                  you would; your word should be my law.<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7945-00000084"/>
                  I will go with you wherever you will,—to confession, to sacrament, to prayers,
                  never so often; never will I rebel against your word; if you decree, I will bend
                  my neck to king or priest; I will reconcile me with anybody or anything only for
                  your sweet sake; you shall lead me all my life; and when we die, I ask only that
                  you may lead me to our Mother's throne in heaven, and pray her to tolerate me for
                  your sake. Come, now, dear, is not even one unworthy soul worth saving?"</p>
               <p>"My Lord, you have taught me how wise my holy father was in forbidding me to
                  listen to you. He knew better than I how weak was my heart, and how I might be
                  drawn on from step to step till——My Lord, I must be no man's wife. I follow the
                  blessed Saint Agnes? May God give me grace to keep my vows without wavering!—for
                  then I shall gain power to intercede for you and bring down blessings on your
                  soul. Oh, never, never speak to me so again, my Lord!—you will make me very,
                     <emph>very</emph> unhappy. If there is any truth in your words, my Lord, if you
                  really love me, you will go, and you will never try to speak to me again."</p>
               <p>"Never, Agnes? never? Think what you are saying!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I do think! I know it must be best," said Agnes, much agitated; "for, if I
                  should see you often and hear your voice, I should lose all my strength. I could
                  never resist, and I should lose heaven for you and me too. Leave me, and I will
                  never, never forget to pray for you; and go quickly too, for it is time for my
                  grandmother to come home, and she would be so angry,—she would never believe I had
                  not been doing wrong, and perhaps she would make me marry somebody that I do not
                  wish to. She has threatened that many times; but I beg her to leave me free to go
                  to my sweet home in the convent and my dear Mother Theresa."</p>
               <p>"They shall never marry you against your will, little Agnes, I pledge you my
                  knightly word. I will protect you from that. Promise me, dear, that, if ever you
                  be man's wife, you will be mine. Only promise me that, and I will go."</p>
               <p>"Will you?" said Agnes, in an ecstacy of fear and apprehension, in which there
                  mingled some strange troubled gleams of happiness. "Well, then, I will. Ah! I hope
                  it is no sin!"</p>
               <p>"Believe me, dearest, it is not," said the knight. "Say it again,—say, that I may
                  hear it,—say, 'If ever I am man's wife, I will be thine,'—say it, and I will
                  go."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, my Lord, if ever I am man's wife, I will be thine," said Agnes. "But
                  I will be no man's wife. My heart and hand are promised elsewhere. Come, now, my
                  Lord, your word must be kept."</p>
               <p>"Let me put this ring on your finger, lest you forget," said the cavalier. "It was
                  my mother's ring, and never during her lifetime heard anything but prayers and
                  hymns. It is saintly, and worthy of thee."</p>
               <p>"No, my Lord, I may not. Grandmother would inquire about it. I cannot keep it; but
                  fear not my forgetting: I shall never forget you."</p>
               <p>"Will you ever want to see me, Agnes?"</p>
               <p>"I hope not, since it is not best. But you do not go."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, farewell, my little wife! farewell, till I claim thee!" said the
                  cavalier, as he kissed her hand, and vaulted over the wall.</p>
               <p>"How strange that I <emph>cannot</emph> make him understand!" said Agnes, when he
                  was gone. "I must have sinned, I must<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7945-00000085"/>
                  have done wrong; but I have been trying all the while to do right. Why would he
                  stay so, and look at me so with those deep eyes? I was very hard with him,—very! I
                  trembled for him, I was so severe; and yet it has not discouraged him enough. How
                  strange that he would call me so, after all, when I explained to him I never could
                  marry!—Must I tell all this to Father Francesco? How dreadful! How he looked at me
                  before! How he trembled and turned away from me! What will he think now? Ah, me!
                  why must I tell <emph>him?</emph> If I could only confess to my mother Theresa,
                  that would be easier. We have a mother in heaven to hear us; why should we not
                  have a mother on earth? Father Francesco frightens me so! His eyes burn me! They
                  seem to burn into my soul, and he seems angry with me sometimes, and sometimes
                  looks at me so strangely! Dear, blessed Mother," she said, kneeling at the shrine,
                  "help thy little child! I do not want to do wrong: I want to do right. Oh that I
                  could come and live with thee!"</p>
               <p>Poor Agnes! a new experience had opened in her heretofore tranquil life, and her
                  day was one of conflict. Do what she would, the words that had been spoken to her
                  in the morning would return to her mind, and sometimes she awoke with a shock of
                  guilty surprise at finding she had been dreaming over what the cavalier said to
                  her of living with him alone, in some clear, high, purple solitude of those
                  beautiful mountains which she remembered as an enchanted dream of her childhood.
                  Would he really always love her, then, always go with her to prayers and mass and
                  sacrament, and be reconciled to the Church, and should she indeed have the joy of
                  feeling that this noble soul was led back to heavenly peace through her? Was not
                  this better than a barren life of hymns and prayers in a cold convent? Then the
                  very voice that said these words, that voice of veiled strength and manly daring,
                  that spoke with such a gentle pleading, and yet such an undertone of authority, as
                  if he had a right to claim her for himself,—she seemed to feel the tones of that
                  voice in every nerve;—and then the strange thrilling pleasure of thinking that he
                  loved her so. Why should he, this strange, beautiful knight? Doubtless he had seen
                  splendid high-born ladies,—he had seen even queens and princesses,—and what could
                  he find to like in her, a poor little peasant? Nobody ever thought so much of her
                  before, and he was so unhappy without her;—it was strange he should be; but he
                  said so, and it must be true. After all, Father Francesco might be mistaken about
                  his being wicked. On the whole, she felt sure he was mistaken, at least in part.
                  Uncle Antonio did not seem to be so much shocked at what she told him; he knew the
                  temptations of men better, perhaps, because he did not stay shut up in one
                  convent, but travelled all about, preaching and teaching. If only he could see
                  him, and talk with him, and make him a good Christian,—why, then, there would be
                  no further need of her;—and Agnes was surprised to find what a dreadful, dreary
                  blank appeared before her when she thought of this. Why should she wish him to
                  remember her, since she never could be his?—and yet nothing seemed so dreadful as
                  that he should forget her. So the poor little innocent fly beat and fluttered in
                  the mazes of that enchanted web, where thousands of her frail sex have beat and
                  fluttered before.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE MONK AND THE CAVALIER.</head>
               <p>FATHER ANTONIO had been down through the streets of the old town of Sorrento,
                  searching for the young stone-cutter, and, finding him, had spent some time in
                  enlightening him as to the details of the work he wished him to execute.</p>
               <p>He found him not so easily kindled into devotional fervors as he had fondly
                  imagined, nor could all his most devout exhortations produce one quarter of the
                  effect upon him that resulted from the discovery that it was the fair Agnes who
                  originated the design and was interested in its execution. Then did the large
                  black eyes of the youth kindle into something of sympathetic fervor, and he
                  willingly promised to do his very best at the carving.</p>
               <p>"I used to know the fair Agnes well, years ago," he said, "but of late she will
                  not even look at me; yet I worship her none the less. Who can help it that sees
                  her? I don't think she is so hard-hearted as she seems; but her grandmother and
                  the priests won't so much as allow her to lift up her eyes when one of us young
                  fellows goes by. Twice these five years past have I seen her eyes, and then it was
                  when I contrived to get near the holy water when there was a press round it of a
                  saint's day, and I reached some to her on my finger, and then she smiled upon me
                  and thanked me. Those two smiles are all I have had to live on for all this time.
                  Perhaps, if I work very well, she will give me another, and perhaps she will say,
                  'Thank you, my good Pietro!' as she used to, when I brought her birds' eggs or
                  helped her across the ravine, years ago."</p>
               <p>"Well, my brave boy, do your best," said the monk, "and let the shrine be of the
                  fairest white marble. I will be answerable for the expense; I will beg it of those
                  who have substance."</p>
               <p>"So please you, holy father," said Pietro, "I know of a spot, a little below here
                  on the coast, where was a heathen temple in the old days; and one can dig
                  therefrom long pieces of fair white marble, all covered with heathen images. I
                  know not whether your Reverence would think them fit for Christian purposes."</p>
               <p>"So much the better, boy! so much the better!" said the monk, heartily. "Only let
                  the marble be fine and white, and it is as good as converting a heathen any time
                  to baptize it to Christian uses. A few strokes of the chisel will soon demolish
                  their naked nymphs and other such rubbish, and we can carve holy virgins, robed
                  from head to foot in all modesty, as becometh saints."</p>
               <p>"I will get my boat and go down this very afternoon," said Pietro; "and, Sir, I
                  hope I am not making too bold in asking you, when you see the fair Agnes, to
                  present unto her this lily, in memorial of her old playfellow."</p>
               <p>"That I will, my boy! And now I think of it, she spoke kindly of you as one that
                  had been a companion in her childhood, but said her grandmother would not allow
                  her to speak to you now."</p>
               <p>"Ah, that is it!" said Pietro. "Old Elsie is a fierce old kite, with strong beak
                  and long claws, and will not let the poor girl have any good of her youth. Some
                  say she means to marry her to some rich old man, and some say she will shut her up
                  in a convent, which I should say was a sore hurt<pb n="172-173"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000087"/> and loss to the world. There are a plenty of women,
                  whom nobody wants to look at, for that sort of work; and a beautiful face is a
                  kind of psalm which makes one want to be good."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, my boy, work well and faithfully for the saints on this shrine, and I
                  dare promise you many a smile from this fair maiden; for her heart is set upon the
                  glory of God and his saints, and she will smile on any one who helps on the good
                  work. I shall look in on you daily for a time, till I see the work well
                  started."</p>
               <p>So saying, the old monk took his leave. Just as he was passing out of the house,
                  some one brushed rapidly by him, going down the street. As he passed, the quick
                  eye of the monk recognized the cavalier whom he had seen in the garden but a few
                  evenings before. It was not a face and form easily forgotten, and the monk
                  followed him at a little distance behind, resolving, if he saw him turn in
                  anywhere, to follow and crave an audience of him.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, as he saw the cavalier entering under the low arch that led to his
                  hotel, he stepped up and addressed him with a gesture of benediction.</p>
               <p>"God bless you, my son!"</p>
               <p>"What would you with me, father?" said the cavalier, with a hasty and somewhat
                  suspicious glance.</p>
               <p>"I would that you would give me an audience of a few moments on some matters of
                  importance," said the monk, mildly.</p>
               <p>The tones of his voice seemed to have excited some vague remembrance in the mind
                  of the cavalier; for he eyed him narrowly, and seemed trying to recollect where he
                  had seen him before. Suddenly a light appeared to flash upon his mind; for his
                  whole manner became at once more cordial.</p>
               <p>"My good father," he said, "my poor lodging and leisure are at your service for
                  any communication you may see fit to make."</p>
               <p>So saying, he led the way up the damp, ill-smelling stone staircase, and opened
                  the door of the deserted room where we have seen him once before. Closing the
                  door, and seating himself at the one rickety table which the room afforded, he
                  motioned to the monk to be seated also; then taking off his plumed hat, he threw
                  it negligently on the table beside him, and passing his white, finely formed hand
                  through the black curls of his hair, he tossed them carelessly from his forehead,
                  and, leaning his chin in the hollow of his hand, fixed his glittering eyes on the
                  monk in a manner that seemed to demand his errand.</p>
               <p>"My Lord," said the monk, in those gentle, conciliating tones which were natural
                  to him, "I would ask a little help of you in regard of a Christian undertaking
                  which I have here in hand. The dear Lord hath put it into the heart of a pious
                  young maid of this vicinity to erect a shrine to the honor of our Lady and her
                  dear Son in this gorge of Sorrento, hard by. It is a gloomy place in the night,
                  and hath been said to be haunted by evil spirits; and my fair niece, who is full
                  of all holy thoughts, desired me to draw the plan for this shrine, and, so far as
                  my poor skill may go, I have done so. See here, my Lord, are the drawings."</p>
               <p>The monk laid them down on the table, his pale cheek flushing with a faint glow of
                  artistic enthusiasm and pride, as he explained to the young man the plan and
                  drawings.</p>
               <p>The cavalier listened courteously, but without much apparent interest, till the
                  monk drew from his portfolio a paper and said,—</p>
               <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7945-00000088"/>
               <p>"This, my Lord, is my poor and feeble conception of the most sacred form of our
                  Lady, which I am to paint for the centre of the shrine."</p>
               <p>He laid down the paper, and the cavalier, with a sudden exclamation, snatched it
                  up, looking at it eagerly.</p>
               <p>"It is she!" he said; "it is her very self!—the divine Agnes,—the lily flower,—the
                  sweet star,—the only one among women!"</p>
               <p>"I see you have recognized the likeness," said the monk, blushing. "I know it hath
                  been thought a practice of doubtful edification to represent holy things under the
                  image of aught earthly; but when any mortal seems especially gifted with a
                  heavenly spirit outshining in the face, it may be that our Lady chooses that
                  person to reveal herself in."</p>
               <p>The cavalier was gazing so intently on the picture that he scarcely heard the
                  apology of the monk; he held it up, and seemed to study it with a long admiring
                  gaze.</p>
               <p>"You have great skill with your pencil, my father," he said; "one would not look
                  for such things from under a monk's hood."</p>
               <p>"I belong to the San Marco in Florence, of which you may have heard," said Father
                  Antonio, "and am an unworthy disciple of the traditions of the blessed Angelico,
                  whose visions of heavenly things are ever before us; and no less am I a disciple
                  of the renowned Savonarola, of whose fame all Italy hath heard before now."</p>
               <p>"Savonarola?" said the other, with eagerness,—"he that makes these vile miscreants
                  that call themselves Pope and cardinals tremble? All Italy, all Christendom, is
                  groaning and stretching out the hand to him to free them from these abominations.
                  My father, tell me of Savonarola: how goes he, and what success hath he?"</p>
               <p>"My son, it is now many months since I left Florence; since which time I have been
                  sojourning in by-places, repairing shrines and teaching the poor of the Lord's
                  flock, who are scattered and neglected by the idle shepherds, who think only to
                  eat the flesh and warm themselves with the fleece of the sheep for whom the Good
                  Shepherd gave his life. My duties have been humble and quiet; for it is not given
                  to me to wield the sword of rebuke and controversy, like my great master."</p>
               <p>"And you have not heard, then," said the cavalier, eagerly, "that they have
                  excommunicated him?"</p>
               <p>"I knew that was threatened," said the monk, "but I did not think it possible that
                  it could befall a man of such shining holiness of life, so signally and openly
                  owned of God that the very gifts of the first Apostles seem revived in him."</p>
               <p>"Does not Satan always hate the Lord," said the cavalier. "Alexander and his
                  councils are possessed of the Devil, if ever men were,—and are sealed as his
                  children by every abominable wickedness. The Devil sits in Christ's seat, and hath
                  stolen his signet-ring, to seal decrees against the Lord's own followers. What are
                  Christian men to do in such case?"</p>
               <p>The monk sighed and looked troubled.</p>
               <p>"It is hard to say," he answered. "So much I know,—that before I left Florence our
                  master wrote to the King of France touching the dreadful state of things at Rome,
                  and tried to stir him up to call a general council of the Church. I much fear me
                  this letter may have fallen into the hands of the Pope."</p>
               <p>"I tell you, father," said the young man, starting up and laying his hand on his
                  sword, "<emph>we must fight!</emph> It is the<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000089"/> sword that must decide this matter! Was not the
                  Holy Sepulchre saved from the Infidels by the sword?—and once more the sword must
                  save the Holy City from worse infidels than the Turks. If such doings as these are
                  allowed in the Holy City, another generation there will be no Christians left on
                  earth. Alexander and Cæsar Borgia and the Lady Lucrezia are enough to drive
                  religion from the world. They make us long to go back to the traditions of our
                  Roman fathers,—who were men of cleanly and honorable lives and of heroic deeds,
                  scorning bribery and deceit. They honored God by noble lives, little as they knew
                  of Him. But these men are a shame to the mothers that bore them."</p>
               <p>"You speak too truly, my son," said the monk. "Alas! the creation groaneth and
                  travaileth in pain with these things. Many a time and oft have I seen our master
                  groaning and wrestling with God on this account. For it is to small purpose that
                  we have gone through Italy preaching and stirring up the people to more holy
                  lives, when from the very hill of Zion, the height of the sanctuary, come down
                  these streams of pollution. It seems as if the time had come that the world could
                  bear it no longer."</p>
               <p>"Well, if it come to the trial of the sword, as come it must," said the cavalier,
                  "say to your master that Agostino Sarelli has a band of one hundred tried men and
                  an impregnable fastness in the mountains, where he may take refuge, and where they
                  will gladly hear the Word of God from pure lips. They call us robbers,—us who have
                  gone out from the assembly of robbers, that we might lead honest and cleanly
                  lives. There is not one among us that hath not lost houses, lands, brothers,
                  parents, children, or friends through their treacherous cruelty. There be those
                  whose wives and sisters have been forced into the Borgia harem; there be those
                  whose children have been tortured before their eyes,—those who have seen the
                  fairest and dearest slaughtered by these hell-hounds, who yet sit in the seat of
                  the Lord and give decrees in the name of Christ. Is there a God? If there be, why
                  is He silent?"</p>
               <p>"Yea, my son, there is a God," said the monk; "but His ways are not as ours. A
                  thousand years in His sight are but as yesterday, as a watch in the night. He
                  shall come, and shall not keep silence."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you do not know, father," said the young man, "that I, too, am
                  excommunicated. I am excommunicated, because, Cæsar Borgia having killed my oldest
                  brother, and dishonored and slain my sister, and seized on all our possessions,
                  and the Pope having protected and confirmed him therein, I declare the Pope to be
                  not of God, but of the Devil. I will not submit to him, nor be ruled by him; and I
                  and my fellows will make good our mountains against him and his crew with such
                  right arms as the good Lord hath given us."</p>
               <p>"The Lord be with you, my son!" said the monk; "and the Lord bring His Church out
                  of these deep waters! Surely, it is a lovely and beautiful Church, made dear and
                  precious by innumerable saints and martyrs who have given their sweet lives up
                  willingly for it; and it is full of records of righteousness, of prayers and alms
                  and works of mercy that have made even the very dust of our Italy precious and
                  holy. Why hast Thou abandoned this vine of Thy planting, O Lord? The boar out of
                  the wood doth waste it; the wild beast of the field doth devour it. Return, we
                  beseech Thee, and visit this vine of Thy planting!"</p>
               <p>The monk clasped his hands and looked upward pleadingly<pb n="178-179"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000090"/> ingly, the tears running down his wasted cheeks.
                  Ah, many such strivings and prayers in those days went up from silent hearts in
                  obscure solitudes, that wrestled and groaned under that mighty burden which Luther
                  at last received strength to heave from the heart of the Church.</p>
               <p>"Then, father, you do admit that one may be banned by the Pope, and may utterly
                  refuse and disown him, and yet be a Christian?"</p>
               <p>"How can I otherwise?" said the monk. "Do I not see the greatest saint this age or
                  any age has ever seen under the excommunication of the greatest sinner? Only, my
                  son, let me warn you. Become not irreverent to the true Church, because of a false
                  usurper. Reverence the sacraments, the hymns, the prayers all the more for this
                  sad condition in which you stand. What teacher is more faithful in these respects
                  than my master? Who hath more zeal for our blessed Lord Jesus, and a more living
                  faith in Him? Who hath a more filial love and tenderness towards our blessed
                  Mother? Who hath more reverent communion with all the saints than he? Truly, he
                  sometimes seems to me to walk encompassed by all the armies of heaven,—such a
                  power goes forth in his words, and such a holiness in his life."</p>
               <p>"Ah," said Agostino, "would I had such a confessor! The sacraments might once more
                  have power for me, and I might cleanse my soul from unbelief."</p>
               <p>"Dear son," said the monk, "accept a most unworthy, but sincere follower of this
                  holy prophet, who yearns for thy salvation. Let me have the happiness of granting
                  to thee the sacraments of the Church, which, doubtless, are thine by right as one
                  of the flock of the Lord Jesus. Come to me some day this week in confession, and
                  thereafter thou shalt receive the Lord within thee, and be once more united to
                  Him."</p>
               <p>"My good father," said the young man, grasping his hand, and much affected, "I
                  will come. Your words have done me good; but I must think more of them. I will
                  come soon; but these things cannot be done without pondering; it will take some
                  time to bring my heart into charity with all men."</p>
               <p>The monk rose up to depart, and began to gather up his drawings.</p>
               <p>"For this matter, father," said the cavalier, throwing several gold pieces upon
                  the table, "take these, and as many more as you need ask for your good work. I
                  would willingly pay any sum," he added, while a faint blush rose to his cheek, "if
                  you would give me a copy of this. Gold would be nothing in comparison with
                  it."</p>
               <p>"My son," said the monk, smiling, "would it be to thee an image of an earthly or a
                  heavenly love?"</p>
               <p>"Of both, father," said the young man. "For that dear face has been more to me
                  than prayer or hymn; it has been even as a sacrament to me, and through it I know
                  not what of holy and heavenly influences have come to me."</p>
               <p>"Said I not well," said the monk, exulting, "that there were those on whom our
                  Mother shed such grace that their very beauty led heavenward? Such are they whom
                  the artist looks for, when he would adorn a shrine where the faithful shall
                  worship. Well, my son, I must use my poor art for you; and as for gold, we of our
                  convent take it not except for the adorning of holy things, such as this
                  shrine."</p>
               <p>"How soon shall it be done?" said the young man, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Patience, patience, my Lord! Rome was not built in a day, and our art must work
                  by slow touches; but I will do my best. But wherefore, my Lord, cherish this
                  image?"</p>
               <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7945-00000091"/>
               <p>"Father, are you of near kin to this maid?"</p>
               <p>"I am her mother's only brother."</p>
               <p>"Then I say to you, as the nearest of her male kin, that I seek this maid in pure
                  and honorable marriage; and she hath given me her promise, that, if ever she be
                  wife of mortal man, she will be mine."</p>
               <p>"But she looks not to be wife of any man," said the monk; "so, at least, I have
                  heard her say; though her grandmother would fain marry her to a husband of her
                  choosing. 'T is a wilful woman, is my sister Elsie, and a worldly,—not easy to
                  persuade, and impossible to drive."</p>
               <p>"And she hath chosen for this fair angel some base peasant churl who will have no
                  sense of her exceeding loveliness? By the saints, if it come to this, I will carry
                  her away with the strong arm!"</p>
               <p>"That is not to be apprehended just at present. Sister Elsie is dotingly fond of
                  the girl, which hath slept in her bosom since infancy."</p>
               <p>"And why should I not demand her in marriage of your sister?" said the young
                  man.</p>
               <p>"My Lord, you are an excommunicated man, and she would have horror of you. It is
                  impossible; it would not be to edification to make the common people judges in
                  such matters. It is safest to let their faith rest undisturbed, and that they be
                  not taught to despise ecclesiastical censures. This could not be explained to
                  Elsie; she would drive you from her doors with her distaff, and you would scarce
                  wish to put your sword against it. Besides, my Lord, if you were not
                  excommunicated, you are of noble blood, and this alone would be a fatal objection
                  with my sister, who hath sworn on the holy cross that Agnes shall never love one
                  of your race."</p>
               <p>"What is the cause of this hatred?"</p>
               <p>"Some foul wrong which a noble did her mother," said the monk; "for Agnes is of
                  gentle blood on her father's side."</p>
               <p>"I might have known it," said the cavalier to himself; "her words and ways are
                  unlike anything in her class.—Father," he added, touching his sword, "we soldiers
                  are fond of cutting all Gordian knots, whether of love or religion, with this. The
                  sword, father, is the best theologian, the best casuist. The sword rights wrongs
                  and punishes evildoers, and some day the sword may cut the way out of this
                  embarrass also."</p>
               <p>"Gently, my son! gently!" said the monk; "nothing is lost by patience. See how
                  long it takes the good Lord to make a fair flower out of a little seed; and He
                  does all quietly, without bluster. Wait on Him a little in peacefulness and
                  prayer, and see what He will do for thee."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you are right, my father," said the cavalier, cordially. "Your counsels
                  have done me good, and I shall seek them further. But do not let them terrify my
                  poor Agnes with dreadful stories of the excommunication that hath befallen me. The
                  dear saint is breaking her good little heart for my sins, and her confessor
                  evidently hath forbidden her to speak to me or look at me. If her heart were left
                  to itself, it would fly to me like a little tame bird, and I would cherish it
                  forever; but now she sees sin in every innocent, womanly thought,—poor little dear
                  child-angel that she is!"</p>
               <p>"Her confessor is a Franciscan," said the monk, who, good as he was, could not
                  escape entirely from the ruling prejudice of his order,—"and, from what I know of
                  him, I should think might be unskilful in what pertaineth to the<pb n="182-183"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000092"/> nursing of so delicate a lamb. It is not every one
                  to whom is given the gift of rightly directing souls."</p>
               <p>"I'd like to carry her off from him!" said the cavalier, between his teeth. "I
                  will, too, if he is not careful!" Then he added aloud, "Father, Agnes is
                  mine,—mine by the right of the truest worship and devotion that man could ever pay
                  to woman,—mine because she loves me. For I know she loves me; I know it far better
                  than she knows it herself, the dear innocent child! and I will not have her torn
                  from me to waste her life in a lonely, barren convent, or to be the wife of a
                  stolid peasant. I am a man of my word, and I will vindicate my right to her in the
                  face of God and man."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, my son, as I said before, patience,—one thing at a time. Let us say
                  our prayers and sleep to-night, to begin with, and to-morrow will bring us fresh
                  counsel."</p>
               <p>"Well, my father, you will be for me in this matter?" said the young man.</p>
               <p>"My son, I wish you all happiness; and if this be for your best good and that of
                  my dear niece, I wish it. But, as I said, there must be time and patience. The way
                  must be made clear. I will see how the case stands; and you may be sure, when I
                  can in good conscience, I will befriend you."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my father, thank you!" said the young man, bending his knee to receive
                  the monk's parting benediction.</p>
               <p>"It seems to me not best," said the monk, turning once more, as he was leaving the
                  threshold, "that you should come to me at present where I am,—it would only raise
                  a storm that I could not allay; and so great would be the power of the forces they
                  might bring to bear on the child, that her little heart might break and the saints
                  claim her too soon."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, father, come hither to me to-morrow at this same hour, if I be not
                  too unworthy of your pastoral care."</p>
               <p>"I shall be too happy, my son," said the monk. "So be it."</p>
               <p>And he turned from the door just as the bell of the cathedral struck the Ave
                  Maria, and all in the street bowed in the evening act of worship.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE MONK'S STRUGGLE.</head>
               <p>THE golden sunshine of the spring morning was deaden to a sombre tone in the
                  shadowy courts of the Capuchin convent. The reddish brown of the walls was flecked
                  with gold and orange spots of lichen; and here and there, in crevices, tufts of
                  grass, or even a little bunch of gold-blooming flowers, looked hardily forth into
                  the shadowy air. A covered walk, with stone arches, enclosed a square filled with
                  dusky shrubbery. There were tall funereal cypresses, whose immense height and
                  scraggy profusion of decaying branches showed their extreme old age. There were
                  gaunt, gnarled olives, with trunks twisted in immense serpent folds, and bows
                  wreathed and knotted into wild, unnatural contractions, as if their growth had
                  been a series of spasmodic convulsions, instead of a calm and gentle development
                  of Nature. There were overgrown clumps of aloes, with the bare skeletons of former
                  flower-stalks standing erect among their dusky horns or lying rotting on the
                  ground beside them. The place had evidently been intended for the culture of
                  shrubbery and flowers, but the growth of the trees had long since so intercepted
                  the sunlight and fresh air that not even grass could find root beneath their
                  branches. The ground was covered with a damp green mould, strewn here and there
                  with dead boughs, or patched with tufts of fern and lycopodium, throwing out their
                  green hairy roots into the moist soil. A few half-dead roses and jasmines,
                  remnants of former days of flowers, still maintained a struggling existence, but
                  looked wan and discouraged in the effort, and seemed to stretch and pine vaguely
                  for a freer air. In fact, the whole garden might be looked upon as a sort of
                  symbol of the life by which it was surrounded,—a life stagnant, unnatural, and
                  unhealthy, cut off from all those thousand stimulants to wholesome development
                  which are afforded by the open plain of human existence, where strong natures grow
                  distorted in unnatural efforts, though weaker ones find in its lowly shadows a
                  congenial refuge.</p>
               <p>We have given the brighter side of conventual life in the days we are describing:
                  we have shown it as often a needed shelter of woman's helplessness during ages of
                  political uncertainty and revolution; we have shown it as the congenial retreat
                  where the artist, the poet, the student, and the man devoted to ideas found
                  leisure undisturbed to develop themselves under the consecrating protection of
                  religion. The picture would be unjust to truth, did we not recognize, what, from
                  our knowledge of human nature, we must expect, a conventual life of far less
                  elevated and refined order. We should expect that institutions which guarantied to
                  each individual a livelihood, without the necessity of physical labor or the
                  responsibility of supporting a family, might in time come to be incumbered with
                  many votaries in whom indolence and improvidence were the only impelling motives.
                  In all ages of the world the unspiritual are the majority,—the spiritual the
                  exceptions. It was to the <emph>multitude</emph> that Jesus said, "Ye seek me, not
                  because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did <emph>eat</emph> and were
                  filled,"—and the multitude has been much of the same mind from that day to
                  this.</p>
               <p>The convent of which we speak had been for some years<pb n="186-187"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000094"/> under the lenient rule of the jolly Brother
                  Girolamo,—an easy, wide-spread, loosely organized body, whose views of the purpose
                  of human existence were decidedly Anacreontic. Fasts he abominated,—night-prayers
                  he found unfavorable to his constitution; but he was a judge of olives and good
                  wine, and often threw out valuable hints in his pastoral visits on the cooking of
                  maccaroni, for which he had himself elaborated a savory recipe; and the cellar and
                  larder of the convent, during his pastorate, presented so many urgent
                  solicitations to conventual repose, as to threaten an inconvenient increase in the
                  number of brothers. The monks in his time lounged in all the sunny places of the
                  convent like so many loose sacks of meal, enjoying to the full the <foreign
                     xml:lang="ITA">dolce far niente</foreign> which seems to be the universal rule
                  of Southern climates. They ate and drank and slept and snored; they made pastoral
                  visits through the surrounding community which were far from edifying; they
                  gambled, and tippled, and sang most unspiritual songs; and keeping all the while
                  their own private pass-key to Paradise tucked under their girdles, were about as
                  jolly a set of sailors to Eternity as the world had to show. In fact, the climate
                  of Southern Italy and its gorgeous scenery are more favorable to voluptuous
                  ecstasy than to the severe and grave warfare of the true Christian soldier. The
                  sunny plains of Capua demoralized the soldiers of Hannibal, and it was not without
                  a reason that ancient poets made those lovely regions the abode of Sirens whose
                  song maddened by its sweetness, and of a Circe who made men drunk with her sensual
                  fascinations, till they became sunk to the form of brutes. Here, if anywhere, is
                  the lotos-eater's paradise,—the purple skies, the enchanted shores, the soothing
                  gales, the dreamy mists, which all conspire to melt the energy of the will, and to
                  make existence either a half doze of dreamy apathy or an awaking of mad
                  delirium.</p>
               <p>It was not from dreamy, voluptuous Southern Italy that the religious progress of
                  the Italian race received any vigorous impulses. These came from more northern and
                  more mountainous regions, from the severe, clear heights of Florence, Perugia, and
                  Assisi, where the intellectual and the moral both had somewhat of the old Etruscan
                  earnestness and gloom.</p>
               <p>One may easily imagine the stupid alarm and helpless confusion of these easy-going
                  monks, when their new Superior came down among them hissing with a white heat from
                  the very hottest furnace-fires of a new religious experience, burning and
                  quivering with the terrors of the world to come,—pale, thin, eager, tremulous, and
                  yet with all the martial vigor of the former warrior, and all the habits of
                  command of a former princely station. His reforms gave no quarter to right or
                  left; sleepy monks were dragged out to midnight-prayers, and their devotions
                  enlivened with vivid pictures of hell-fire and ingenuities of eternal torment
                  enough to stir the blood of the most torpid. There was to be no more gormandizing,
                  no more wine-bibbing; the choice old wines were placed under lock and key for the
                  use of the sick and poor in the vicinity; and every fast of the Church, and every
                  obsolete rule of the order, were revived with unsparing rigor. It is true, they
                  hated their new Superior with all the energy which laziness and good-living had
                  left them, but they every soul of them shook in their sandals before him; for
                  there is a true and established order of mastery among human beings, and when a
                  man of enkindled energy and intense will comes among a flock of irresolute
                  commonplace individuals, he subjects them to himself by a sort of moral<pb
                     n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7945-00000095"/> paralysis similar to what a great,
                  vigorous gymnotus distributes among a fry of inferior fishes. The bolder ones, who
                  made motions of rebellion, were so energetically swooped upon, and consigned to
                  the discipline of dungeon and bread-and-water, that less courageous natures made a
                  merit of siding with the more powerful party, mentally resolving to carry by fraud
                  the points which they despaired of accomplishing by force.</p>
               <p>On the morning we speak of, two monks might have been seen lounging on a stone
                  bench by one of the arches, looking listlessly into the sombre garden-patch we
                  have described. The first of these, Father Anselmo, was a corpulent fellow, with
                  an easy swing of gait, heavy animal features, and an eye of shrewd and stealthy
                  cunning: the whole air of the man expressed the cautious, careful voluptuary. The
                  other, Father Johannes, was thin, wiry, and elastic, with hands like birds' claws,
                  and an eye that reminded one of the crafty cunning of a serpent. His smile was a
                  curious blending of shrewdness and malignity. He regarded his companion from time
                  to time obliquely from the corners of his eyes, to see what impression his words
                  were making, and had a habit of jerking himself up in the middle of a sentence and
                  looking warily round to see if any one were listening, which indicated habitual
                  distrust.</p>
               <p>"Our holy Superior is out a good while this morning," he said, at length.</p>
               <p>The observation was made in the smoothest and most silken tones, but they carried
                  with them such a singular suggestion of doubt and inquiry that they seemed like an
                  accusation.</p>
               <p>"Ah?" replied the other, perceiving evidently some intended undertone of suspicion
                  lurking in the words, but apparently resolved not to commit himself to his
                  companion.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the first; "the zeal of the house of the Lord consumes him, the
                  blessed man!"</p>
               <p>"Blessed man!" echoed the second, rolling up his eyes, and giving a deep sigh,
                  which shook his portly proportions so that they quivered like jelly.</p>
               <p>"If he goes on in this way much longer," continued Father Johannes, "there will
                  soon be very little mortal left of him; the saints will claim him."</p>
               <p>Father Anselmo gave something resembling a pious groan, but darted meanwhile a
                  shrewd observant glance at the speaker.</p>
               <p>"What would become of the convent, were he gone?" said Father Johannes. "All these
                  blessed reforms which he has brought about would fall back; for our nature is
                  fearfully corrupt, and ever tends to wallow in the mire of sin and pollution. What
                  changes hath he wrought in us all! To be sure, the means were sometimes severe. I
                  remember, brother, when he had you under ground for more than ten days. My heart
                  was pained for you; but I suppose you know that it was necessary, in order to
                  bring you to that eminent state of sanctity where you now stand."</p>
               <p>The heavy, sensual features of Father Anselmo flushed up with some emotion,
                  whether of anger or of fear it was hard to tell; but he gave one hasty glance at
                  his companion, which, if a glance could kill, would have struck him dead, and then
                  there fell over his countenance, like a veil, an expression of sanctimonious
                  humility, as he replied,—</p>
               <p>"Thank you for your sympathy, dearest brother. I remember, too, how I felt for you
                  that week when you were fed only on bread and water, and had to take it on your<pb
                     n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7945-00000096"/> knees off the floor, while the rest of
                  us sat at table. How blessed it must be to have one's pride brought down in that
                  way! When our dear, blessed Superior first came, brother, you were as a bullock
                  unaccustomed to the yoke, but now what a blessed change! It must give you so much
                  peace! How you must love him!"</p>
               <p>"I think we love him about equally," said Father Johannes, his dark, thin features
                  expressing the concentration of malignity. "His labors have been blessed among us.
                  Not often does a faithful shepherd meet so loving a flock. I have been told that
                  the great Peter Abelard found far less gratitude. They tried to poison him in the
                  most holy wine."</p>
               <p>"How absurd!" interrupted Father Anselmo, hastily; "as if the blood of the Lord,
                  as if our Lord himself could be made poison!"</p>
               <p>"Brother, it is a fact," insisted the former, in tones silvery with humility and
                  sweetness.</p>
               <p>"A fact that the most holy blood can be poisoned?" replied the other, with horror
                  evidently genuine.</p>
               <p>"I grieve to say, brother," said Father Johannes, "that in my profane and worldly
                  days I tried that experiment on a dog, and the poor brute died in five minutes.
                  Ah, brother," he added, observing that his obese companion was now thoroughly
                  roused, "you see before you the chief of sinners! Judas was nothing to me; and
                  yet, such are the triumphs of grace, I am an unworthy member of this most blessed
                  and pious brotherhood; but I do penance daily in sackcloth and ashes for my
                  offence."</p>
               <p>"But, Brother Johannes, was it really so? did it really happen?" inquired Father
                  Anselmo, looking puzzled. "Where, then, is our faith?"</p>
               <p>"Doth our faith rest on human reason, or on the evidence of our senses, Brother
                  Anselmo? I bless God that I have arrived at that state where I can adoringly say,
                  'I believe, because it is impossible.' Yea, brother, I know it to be a fact that
                  the ungodly have sometimes destroyed holy men, like our Superior, who could not be
                  induced to taste wine for any worldly purpose, by drugging the blessed cup; so
                  dreadful are the ragings of Satan in our corrupt nature!"</p>
               <p>"I can't see into that," said Father Anselmo, still looking confused.</p>
               <p>"Brother," answered Father Johannes, "permit an unworthy sinner to remind you that
                  you must not try to see into anything; all that is wanted of you in our most holy
                  religion is to shut your eyes and believe; all things are possible to the eye of
                  faith. Now, humanly speaking," he added, with a peculiarly meaning look, "who
                  would believe that you kept all the fasts of our order, and all the extraordinary
                  ones which it hath pleased our blessed Superior to lay upon us, as you surely do?
                  A worldling might swear, to look at you, that such flesh and color must come in
                  some way from good meat and good wine; but we remember how the three children
                  throve on the pulse and rejected the meat from the king's table."</p>
               <p>The countenance of Father Anselmo expressed both anger and alarm at this
                  home-thrust, and the changes did not escape the keen eye of Father Johannes, who
                  went on.</p>
               <p>"I directed the eyes of our holy father upon you as a striking example of the
                  benefits of abstemious living, showing that the days of miracles are not yet past
                  in the Church, as some sceptics would have us believe. He seemed to study you
                  attentively. I have no doubt he will honor you with some more particular
                  inquiries,—the blessed saint!"</p>
               <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7945-00000097"/>
               <p>Father Anselmo turned uneasily on his seat and stealthily eyed his companion, to
                  see, if possible, how much real knowledge was expressed by his words, and then
                  answered on quite another topic.</p>
               <p>"How this garden has fallen to decay! We miss old Father Angelo sorely, who was
                  always trimming and cleansing it. Our Superior is too heavenly-minded to have much
                  thought for earthly things, and so it goes."</p>
               <p>Father Johannes watched this attempt at diversion with a glitter of stealthy
                  malice, and, seeming to be absorbed in contemplation, broke out again exactly
                  where he had left off on the unwelcome subject.</p>
               <p>"I mind me now, Brother Anselmo, that, when you came out of your cell to prayers,
                  the other night, your utterance was thick, and your eyes heavy and watery, and
                  your gait uncertain. One would swear that you had been drunken with new mine; but
                  we knew it was all the effect of fasting and devout contemplation, which
                  inebriates the soul with holy raptures, as happened to the blessed Apostles on the
                  day of Pentecost. I remarked the same to our holy father, and he seemed to give it
                  earnest heed, for I saw him watching you through all the services. How blessed is
                  such watchfulness!"</p>
               <p>"The Devil take him!" said Father Anselmo, suddenly thrown off his guard; but
                  checking himself, he added, confusedly,—"I mean"——</p>
               <p>"I understand you, brother," said Father Johannes; "it is a motion of the old
                  nature not yet entirely subdued. A little more of the discipline of the lower
                  vaults, which you have found so precious, will set all that right."</p>
               <p>"You would not inform against me?" said Father Anselmo, with an expression of
                  alarm.</p>
               <p>"It would be my duty, I suppose," said Father Johannes, with a sigh; "but, sinner
                  that I am, I never could bring my mind to such proceedings with the vigor of our
                  blessed father. Had I been Superior of the convent, as was talked of, how
                  differently might things have proceeded! I should have erred by a sinful laxness.
                  How fortunate that it was he, instead of such a miserable sinner as myself!"</p>
               <p>"Well, tell me, then, Father Johannes,—for your eyes are shrewd as a
                     lynx's,—<emph>is</emph> our good Superior so perfect as he seems? or does he
                  have his little private comforts sometimes, like the rest of us? Nobody, you know,
                  can stand it to be always on the top round of the ladder to Paradise. For my part,
                  between you and me, I never believed all that story they read to us so often about
                  Saint Simeon Stylites, who passed so many years on the top of a pillar and never
                  came down. Trust me, the old boy found his way down sometimes, when all the world
                  was asleep, and got somebody to do duty for him meantime, while he took a little
                  something comfortable. Is it not so?"</p>
               <p>"I am told to believe, and I do believe," said Father Johannes, casting down his
                  eyes, piously; "and, dear brother, it ill befits a sinner like me to reprove; but
                  it seemeth to me as if you make too much use of the eyes of carnal inquiry.
                  Touching the life of our holy father, I cannot believe the most scrupulous watch
                  can detect anything in his walk or conversation other than appears in his
                  profession. His food is next to nothing,—a little chopped spinach or some bitter
                  herb cooked without salt for ordinary days, and on fast days he mingles this with
                  ashes, according to a saintly rule. As for sleep, I believe he does without it;
                  for at no time of the night, when I have knocked at the door of his cell, have I
                  found him sleeping. He is always at his prayers<pb n="194-195"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000098"/> or breviary. His cell hath only a rough, hard board
                  for a bed, with a log of rough wood for a pillow; yet he complains of that as
                  tempting to indolence."</p>
               <p>Father Anselmo shrugged his fat shoulders, ruefully.</p>
               <p>"It's all well enough," he said, "for those that want to take this hard road to
                  Paradise; but why need they drive the flock up with them?"</p>
               <p>"True enough, Brother Anselmo," said Father Johannes; "but the flock will rejoice
                  in it in the end, doubtless. I understand he is purposing to draw yet stricter the
                  reins of discipline. We ought to be thankful."</p>
               <p>"Thankful? We can't wink but six times a week now," said Father Anselmo; "and by
                  and by he won't let us wink at all."</p>
               <p>"Hist! hush! here he comes," said Father Johannes. "What ails him? he looks wild,
                  like a man distraught."</p>
               <p>In a moment more, in fact, Father Francesco strode hastily through the corridor,
                  with his deep-set eyes dilated and glittering, and a vivid hectic flush on his
                  hollow cheeks. He paid no regard to the salutation of the obsequious monks; in
                  fact, he seemed scarcely to see them, but hurried in a disordered manner through
                  the passages and gained the room of his cell, which he shut and locked with a
                  violent clang.</p>
               <p>"What has come over him now?" said Father Anselmo.</p>
               <p>Father Johannes stealthily followed some distance, and then stood with his lean
                  neck outstretched and his head turned in the direction where the Superior had
                  disappeared. The whole attitude of the man, with his acute glittering eye, might
                  remind one of a serpent making an observation before darting after his prey.</p>
               <p>"Something is working him," he said to himself; "what may it be?"</p>
               <p>Meanwhile that heavy oaken door had closed on a narrow cell,—bare of everything
                  which could be supposed to be a matter of convenience in the abode of a human
                  being. A table of the rudest and most primitive construction was garnished with a
                  skull, whose empty eye-holes and grinning teeth were the most conspicuous objects
                  in the room. Behind this stood a large crucifix, manifestly the work of no common
                  master, and bearing evident traces in its workmanship of Florentine art: it was,
                  perhaps, one of the relics of the former wealth of the nobleman who had buried his
                  name and worldly possessions in this living sepulchre. A splendid manuscript
                  breviary, richly illuminated, lay open on the table; and the fair fancy of its
                  flowery letters, the lustre of gold and silver on its pages, formed a singular
                  contrast to the squalid nakedness of everything else in the room. This book, too,
                  had been a family heirloom; some lingering shred of human and domestic affection
                  sheltered itself under the protection of religion in making it the companion of
                  his self-imposed life of penance and renunciation.</p>
               <p>Father Francesco had just returned from the scene in the confessional we have
                  already described. That day had brought to him one of those pungent and vivid
                  inward revelations which sometimes overset in a moment some delusion that has been
                  the cherished growth of years. Henceforth the reign of self-deception was
                  past,—there was no more self-concealment, no more evasion. He loved Agnes,—he knew
                  it,—he said it over and over again to himself with a stormy intensity of energy;
                  and in this hour the whole of his nature seemed to rise in rebellion against the
                  awful barriers which hemmed in and threatened this passion. He now saw clearly
                  that all that he had been calling fatherly tenderness, pastoral zeal, Christian
                  unity, and a thousand other evangelical<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7945-00000099"/>
                  ical names, was nothing more nor less than a passion that had gone to the roots of
                  existence and absorbed into itself all that there was of him. Where was he to look
                  for refuge? What hymn, what prayer had he not blent with her image? It was this
                  that he had given to her as a holy lesson,—it was that that she had spoken of to
                  him as the best expression of her feelings. This prayer he had explained to
                  her,—he remembered just the beautiful light in her eyes, which were fixed on his
                  so trustingly. How dear to him had been that unquestioning devotion, that tender,
                  innocent humility!—how dear, and how dangerous!</p>
               <p>We have read of flowing rivulets, wandering peacefully without ripple or
                  commotion, so long as no barrier stayed their course, suddenly chafing in angry
                  fury when an impassable dam was thrown across their waters. So any affection,
                  however genial and gentle in its own nature, may become an ungovernable, ferocious
                  passion, by the intervention of fatal obstacles in its course. In the case of
                  Father Francesco, the sense of guilt and degradation fell like a blight over all
                  the past that had been so ignorantly happy. He thought he had been living on
                  manna, but found it poison. Satan had been fooling him, leading him on blind-fold,
                  and laughing at his simplicity, and now mocked at his captivity. And how nearly
                  had he been hurried by a sudden and overwhelming influence to the very brink of
                  disgrace! He felt himself shiver and grow cold to think of it. A moment more and
                  he had blasted that pure ear with forbidden words of passion; and even now he
                  remembered, with horror, the look of grave and troubled surprise in those
                  confiding eyes, that had always looked up to him trustingly, as to God. A moment
                  more and he had betrayed the faith he taught her, shattered her trust in the holy
                  ministry, and perhaps imperilled her salvation. He breathed a sigh of relief when
                  he thought of it,—he had not betrayed himself, he had not fallen in her esteem, he
                  still stood on that sacred vantage-ground where his power over her was so great,
                  and where at least he possessed her confidence and veneration. There was still
                  time for recollection, for self-control, for a vehement struggle which should set
                  all right again: but, alas! how shall a man struggle who finds his whole inner
                  nature boiling in furious rebellion against the dictates of his conscience,—self
                  against self?</p>
               <p>It is true, also, that no passions are deeper in their hold, more pervading and
                  more vital to the whole human being, than those that make their first entrance
                  through the higher nature, and, beginning with a religious and poetic ideality,
                  gradually work their way through the whole fabric of the human existence. From
                  grosser passions, whose roots lie in the senses, there is always a refuge in man's
                  loftier nature. He can cast them aside with contempt, and leave them as one whose
                  lower story is flooded can remove to a higher loft, and live serenely with a purer
                  air and wider prospect. But to love that is born of ideality, of intellectual
                  sympathy, of harmonies of the spiritual and immortal nature, of the very poetry
                  and purity of the soul, if it be placed where reason and religion forbid its
                  exercise and expression, what refuge but the grave,—what hope but that wide
                  eternity where all human barriers fall, all human relations end, and love ceases
                  to be a crime? A man of the world may struggle by change of scene, place, and
                  employment. He may put oceans between himself and the things that speak of what he
                  desires to forget. He may fill the void in his life with the stirring excitement
                  of the battle-field, or the whirl of travel from city to city, or the press of
                  business and care. But what<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7945-00000100"/> help is
                  there for him whose life is tied down to the narrow sphere of the convent,—to the
                  monotony of a bare cell, to the endless repetition of the same prayers, the same
                  chants the same prostrations, especially when all that ever redeemed it from
                  monotony has been that image and that sympathy which conscience now bids him
                  forget?</p>
               <p>When Father Francesco precipitated himself into his cell and locked the door, it
                  was with the desperation of a man who flies from a mortal enemy. It seemed to him
                  that all eyes saw just what was boiling within him,—that the wild thoughts that
                  seemed to scream their turbulent importunities in his ears were speaking so loud
                  that all the world would hear. He should disgrace himself before the brethren whom
                  he had so long been striving to bring to order and to teach the lessons of holy
                  self-control. He saw himself pointed at, hissed at, degraded, by the very men who
                  had quailed before his own reproofs; and scarcely, when he had bolted the door
                  behind him, did he feel himself safe. Panting and breathless, he fell on his knees
                  before the crucifix, and, bowing his head in his hands, fell forward upon the
                  floor. As a spent wave melts at the foot of a rock, so all his strength passed
                  away, and he lay awhile in a kind of insensibility,—a state in which, though
                  consciously existing, he had no further control over his thoughts and feelings. In
                  that state of dreamy exhaustion his mind seemed like a mirror, which, without
                  vitality or will of its own, simply lies still and reflects the objects that may
                  pass over it. As clouds sailing in the heavens cast their images, one after
                  another, on the glassy floor of a waveless sea, so the scenes of his former life
                  drifted in vivid pictures athwart his memory. He saw his father's palace,—the
                  wide, cool, marble halls,—the gardens resounding with the voices of falling
                  waters. He saw the fair face of his mother, and played with the jewels upon her
                  hands. He saw again the picture of himself, in all the flush of youth and health,
                  clattering on horseback through the streets of Florence with troops of gay young
                  friends, now dead to him as he to them. He saw himself in the bowers of gay
                  ladies, whose golden hair, lustrous eyes, and siren wiles came back shivering and
                  trembling in the waters of memory in a thousand undulating reflections. There were
                  wild revels,—orgies such as Florence remembers with shame to this day. There was
                  intermingled the turbulent din of arms,—the haughty passion, the sudden
                  provocation, the swift revenge. And then came the awful hour of conviction, the
                  face of that wonderful man whose preaching had stirred all souls,—and then those
                  fearful days of penance,—that darkness of the tomb,—that dying to the world,—those
                  solemn vows, and the fearful struggles by which they had been followed.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my God!" he cried, "is it all in vain?—so many prayers? so many
                  struggles?—and shall I fail of salvation at last?"</p>
               <p>He seemed to himself as a swimmer, who, having exhausted his last gasp of strength
                  in reaching the shore, is suddenly lifted up on a cruel wave and drawn back into
                  the deep. There seemed nothing for him but to fold his arms and sink.</p>
               <p>For he felt no strength now to resist,—he felt no wish to conquer,—he only prayed
                  that he might lie there and die. It seemed to him that the love which possessed
                  him and tyrannized over his very being was a doom,—a curse sent upon him by some
                  malignant fate with whose power it was vain to struggle. He detested his work,—he
                  detested his duties,—he loathed his vows,—and there was not a thing<pb n="200-201"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000101"/> in his whole future to which he looked forward
                  otherwise than with the extreme of aversion, except one to which he clung with a
                  bitter and defiant tenacity,—the spiritual guidance of Agnes. Guidance!—he laughed
                  aloud, in the bitterness of his soul, as he thought of this. He was her guide,—her
                  confessor,—to him she was bound to reveal every change of feeling; and this love
                  that he too well perceived rising in her heart for another,—he would wring from
                  her own confessions the means to repress and circumvent it. If she could not be
                  his, he might at least prevent her from belonging to any other,—he might at least
                  keep her always within the sphere of his spiritual authority. Had he not a right
                  to do this?—had he not a right to cherish an evident vocation,—a right to reclaim
                  her from the embrace of an excommunicated infidel, and present her as a chaste
                  bride at the altar of the Lord? Perhaps, when that was done, when an irrevocable
                  barrier should separate her from all possibility of earthly love, when the awful
                  marriage-vow should have been spoken which should seal her heart for heaven alone,
                  he might recover some of the blessed calm which her influence once brought over
                  him, and these wild desires might cease, and these feverish pulses be still.</p>
               <p>Such were the vague images and dreams of the past and future that floated over his
                  mind, as he lay in a heavy sort of lethargy on the floor of his cell, and hour
                  after hour passed away. It grew afternoon, and the radiance of evening came on.
                  The window of the cell overlooked the broad Mediterranean, all one blue glitter of
                  smiles and sparkles. The white-winged boats were flitting lightly to and fro, like
                  gauzy-winged insects in the summer air,—the song of the fishermen drawing their
                  nets on the beach floated cheerily upward. Capri lay like a half-dissolved opal in
                  shimmering clouds of mist, and Naples gleamed out pearly clear in the purple
                  distance. Vesuvius, with its cloud-spotted sides, its garlanded villas and
                  villages, its silvery crown of vapor, seemed a warm-hearted and genial old giant
                  lying down in his gorgeous repose, and holding all things on his heaving bosom in
                  a kindly embrace.</p>
               <p>So was the earth flooded with light and glory, that the tide poured into the cell,
                  giving the richness of an old Venetian painting to its bare and squalid furniture.
                  The crucifix glowed along all its sculptured lines with rich golden hues. The
                  breviary, whose many-colored leaves fluttered as the wind from the sea drew
                  inward, was yet brighter in its gorgeous tints. It seemed a sort of devotional
                  butterfly perched before the grinning skull, which was bronzed by the enchanted
                  light into warmer tones of color, as if some remembrance of what once it saw and
                  felt came back upon it. So also the bare, miserable board which served for the
                  bed, and its rude pillow, were glorified. A stray sunbeam, too, fluttered down on
                  the floor like a pitying spirit, to light up that pale, thin face, whose classic
                  outlines had now a sharp, yellow setness, like that of swooning or death; it
                  seemed to linger compassionately on the sunken, wasted cheeks, on the long black
                  lashes that fell over the deep hollows beneath the eyes like a funereal veil. Poor
                  man! lying crushed and torn, like a piece of rockweed wrenched from its rock by a
                  storm, and thrown up withered upon the beach!</p>
               <p>From the leaves of the breviary there depends, by a fragment of gold braid, a
                  sparkling something that wavers and glitters in the evening light. It is a cross
                  of the cheapest and simplest material, that once belonged to Agnes. She lost it
                  from her rosary at the confessional, and Father Francesco saw it fall, yet would
                  not warn her of the loss, for he<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7945-00000102"/> longed
                  to possess something that had belonged to her. He made it a mark to one of her
                  favorite hymns; but she never knew where it had gone. Little could she dream, in
                  her simplicity, what a power she held over the man who seemed to her an object of
                  such awful veneration. Little did she dream that the poor little tinsel cross had
                  such a mighty charm with it, and that she herself, in her childlike simplicity,
                  her ignorant innocence, her peaceful tenderness and trust, was raising such a
                  turbulent storm of passion in the heart which she supposed to be above the reach
                  of all human changes.</p>
               <p>And now, through the golden air, the Ave Maria is sounding from the convent-bells,
                  and answered by a thousand tones and echoes from the churches of the old town, and
                  all Christendom gives a moment's adoring pause to celebrate the moment when an
                  angel addressed to a mortal maiden words that had been wept and prayed for during
                  thousands of years. Dimly they sounded through his ear, in that half-deadly
                  trance,—not with plaintive sweetness and motherly tenderness, but like notes of
                  doom and vengeance. He felt rebellious impulses within, which rose up in hatred
                  against them, and all that recalled to his mind the faith which seemed a tyranny,
                  and the vows which appeared to him such a hopeless and miserable failure.</p>
               <p>But now there came other sounds nearer and more earthly. His quickened senses
                  perceive a busy patter of sandalled feet outside his cell, and a whispering of
                  consultation,—and then the silvery, snaky tones of Father Johannes, which had that
                  oily, penetrative quality which passes through all substances with such
                  distinctness.</p>
               <p>"Brethren," he said, "I feel bound in conscience to knock. Our blessed Superior
                  carries his mortifications altogether too far. His faithful sons must beset him
                  with filial inquiries."</p>
               <p>The condition in which Father Francesco was lying, like many abnormal states of
                  extreme exhaustion, seemed to be attended with a mysterious quickening of the
                  magnetic forces and intuitive perceptions. He felt the hypocrisy of those tones,
                  and they sounded in his ear like the suppressed hiss of a deadly serpent. He had
                  always suspected that this man hated him to the death; and he felt now that he was
                  come with his stealthy tread and his almost supernatural power of prying
                  observation, to read the very inmost secrets of his heart. He knew that he longed
                  for nothing so much as the power to hurl him from his place and to reign in his
                  stead; and the instinct of self-defence roused him. He started up as one starts
                  from a dream, waked by a whisper in the ear, and, raising himself on his elbow,
                  looked towards the door.</p>
               <p>A cautious rap was heard, and then a pause. Father Francesco smiled with a
                  peculiar and bitter expression. The rap became louder, more energetic, stormy at
                  last, intermingled with vehement calls on his name.</p>
               <p>Father Francesco rose at length, settled his garments, passed his hands over his
                  brow, and then, composing himself to an expression of deliberate gravity, opened
                  the door and stood before them.</p>
               <p>"Holy father," said Father Johannes, "the hearts of your sons have been saddened.
                  A whole day have you withdrawn your presence from our devotions. We feared you
                  might have fainted, your pious austerities so often transcend the powers of
                  Nature."</p>
               <p>"I grieve to have saddened the hearts of such affectionate sons," said the
                  Superior, fixing his eye keenly on Father<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7945-00000103"
                  /> Johannes; "but I have been performing a peculiar office of prayer to-day for a
                  soul in deadly peril, and have been so absorbed therein that I have known nothing
                  that passed. There is a soul among us, brethren," he added, "that stands at this
                  moment so near to damnation that even the most blessed Mother of God is in doubt
                  for its salvation, and whether it can be saved at all God only knows."</p>
               <p>These words, rising up from a tremendous groundswell of repressed feeling, had a
                  fearful, almost supernatural earnestness that made the body of the monks tremble.
                  Most of them were conscious of living but a shabby, shambling, dissembling life,
                  evading in very possible way the efforts of their Superior to bring them up to the
                  requirements of their profession; and therefore, when these words were bolted out
                  among them with such a glowing intensity, every one of them began mentally feeling
                  for the key of his own private and interior skeleton-closet, and wondering which
                  of their ghastly occupants was coming to light now.</p>
               <p>Father Johannes alone was unmoved, because he had long since ceased to have a
                  conscience. A throb of moral pulsation had for years been an impossibility to the
                  dried and hardened fibre of his inner nature. He was one of those real, genuine,
                  thorough unbelievers in all religion and all faith and all spirituality, whose
                  unbelief grows only more callous by the constant handling of sacred things.
                  Ambition was the ruling motive of his life, and every faculty was sharpened into
                  such acuteness under its action that his penetration seemed at times almost
                  preternatural.</p>
               <p>While he stood with downcast eyes and hands crossed upon his breast, listening to
                  the burning words which remorse and despair wrung from his Superior, he was calmly
                  and warily studying to see what could be made of the evident dent interior
                  conflict that convulsed him. Was there some secret sin? Had that sanctity at last
                  found the temptation that was more than a match for it? And what could it be?</p>
               <p>To a nature with any strong combative force there is no tonic like the presence of
                  a secret and powerful enemy, and the stealthy glances of Father Johannes's serpent
                  eye did more towards restoring Father Francesco to self-mastery than the most
                  conscientious struggles could have done. He grew calm, resolved, determined.
                  Self-respect was dear to him,—and dear to him no less that reflection of
                  self-respect which a man reads in other eyes. He would not forfeit his conventual
                  honor, or bring a stain on his order, or, least of all, expose himself to the
                  scoffing eye of a triumphant enemy. Such were the motives that now came to his
                  aid, while as yet the whole of his inner nature rebelled at the thought that he
                  must tear up by the roots and wholly extirpate this love that seemed to have sent
                  its fine fibres through every nerve of his being. "No!" he said to himself, with a
                  fierce interior rebellion, "<emph>that</emph> I will not do! Right or wrong, come
                  heaven, come hell, I <emph>will</emph> love her: and if lost I must be, lost I
                  will be!" And while this determination lasted, prayer seemed to him a mockery. He
                  dared not pray alone now, when most he needed prayer; but he moved forward with
                  dignity towards the convent-chapel to lead the vesper devotions of his brethren.
                  Outwardly he was calm and rigid as a statue; but as he commenced the service, his
                  utterance had a terrible meaning and earnestness that were felt even by the most
                  drowsy and leaden of his flock. It is singular how the dumb, imprisoned soul,
                  locked within the walls of the body, sometimes gives such a piercing power to the
                  tones of the voice during the<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7945-00000104"/> access of
                  a great agony. The effect is entirely involuntary, and often against the most
                  strenuous opposition of the will; but one sometimes hears another reading or
                  repeating words with an intense vitality, a living force, which tells of some
                  inward anguish or conflict of which the language itself gives no expression.</p>
               <p>Never were the long-drawn intonations of the chants and prayers of the Church
                  pervaded by a more terrible, wild fervor than the Superior that night breathed
                  into them. They seemed to wail, to supplicate, to combat, to menace, to sink in
                  despairing pauses of helpless anguish, and anon to rise in stormy agonies of
                  passionate importunity; and the monks quailed and trembled, they scarce knew why,
                  with forebodings of coming wrath and judgment.</p>
               <p>In the evening exhortation, which it had been the Superior's custom to add to the
                  prayers of the vesper-hour, he dwelt with a terrible and ghastly eloquence on the
                  loss of the soul.</p>
               <p>"Brethren," he said, "believe me, the very first hour of a damned spirit in hell
                  will outweigh all the prosperities of the most prosperous life. If you could gain
                  the whole world, that one hour of hell would outweigh it all; how much more such
                  miserable, pitiful scraps and fragments of the world as they gain who for the sake
                  of a little fleshly ease neglect the duties of a holy profession! There is a broad
                  way to hell through a convent, my brothers, where miserable wretches go who have
                  neither the spirit to serve the Devil wholly, nor the patience to serve God; there
                  be many shaven crowns that gnash their teeth in hell to-night,—many a monk's robe
                  is burning on its owner in living fire, and the devils call him a fool for
                  choosing to be damned in so hard a way. 'Could you not come here by some easier
                  road than a cloister?' they ask. 'If you must sell your soul, why did you not get
                  something for it?' Brethren, there be devils waiting for some of us; they are
                  laughing at your paltry shifts and evasions, at your efforts to make things
                  easy,—for they know how it will all end at last. Rouse yourselves! Awake!
                  Salvation is no easy matter,—nothing to be got between sleeping and waking. Watch,
                  pray, scourge the flesh, fast, weep, bow down in sackcloth, mingle your bread with
                  ashes, if by any means ye may escape the everlasting fire!"</p>
               <p>"Bless me!" said Father Anselmo, when the services were over, casting a
                  half-scared glance after the retreating figure of the Superior as he left the
                  chapel, and drawing a long breath; "it's enough to make one sweat to hear him go
                  on. What has come over him? Anyhow, I'll give myself a hundred lashes this very
                  night: something must be done."</p>
               <p>"Well," said another, "I confess I did hide a cold wing of fowl in the sleeve of
                  my gown last fast-day. My old aunt gave it to me, and I was forced to take it for
                  relation's sake; but I'll do so no more, as I'm a living sinner. I'll do a penance
                  this very night."</p>
               <p>Father Johannes stood under one of the arches that looked into the gloomy garden,
                  and, with his hands crossed upon his breast, and his cold, glittering eye fixed
                  stealthily now on one and now on another, listened with an ill-disguised sneer to
                  these hasty evidences of fear and remorse in the monks, as they thronged the
                  corridor on the way to their cells. Suddenly turning to a young brother who had
                  lately joined the convent, he said to him,—</p>
               <p>"And what of the pretty Clarice, my brother?"</p>
               <p>The blood flushed deep into the pale cheek of the young<pb n="208-209"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000105"/> monk, and his frame shook with some interior
                  emotion as he answered,—</p>
               <p>"She is recovering."</p>
               <p>"And she sent for thee to shrive her?"</p>
               <p>"My God!" said the young man, with an imploring, wild expression in his dark eyes,
                  "she did; but I would not go."</p>
               <p>"Then Nature is still strong," said Father Johannes, pitilessly eying the young
                  man.</p>
               <p>"When will it ever die?" said the stripling, with a despairing gesture; "it heeds
                  neither heaven nor hell."</p>
               <p>"Well, patience, boy! if you have lost an earthly bride, you have gained a
                  heavenly one. The Church is our espoused in white linen. Bless the Lord, without
                  ceasing, for the exchange."</p>
               <p>There was an inexpressible mocking irony in the tones in which this was said, that
                  made itself felt to the finely vitalized spirit of the youth, though to all the
                  rest it sounded like the accredited average pious talk which is more or less the
                  current coin of religious organizations.</p>
               <p>Now no one knows through what wanton deviltry Father Johannes broached this
                  painful topic with the poor youth; but he had a peculiar faculty, with his smooth
                  tones and his sanctimonious smiles, of thrusting red-hot needles into any wounds
                  which he either knew or suspected under the coarse woollen robes of his brethren.
                  He appeared to do it in all coolness, in a way of psychological investigation.</p>
               <p>He smiled, as the youth turned away, and a moment after started as if a thought
                  had suddenly struck him.</p>
               <p>"I have it!" he said to himself. "There may be a woman at the bottom of this
                  discomposure of our holy father; for he is wrought upon by something to the very
                  bottom of his soul. I have not studied human nature so many years for nothing.
                  Father Francesco hath been much in the guidance of women. His preaching hath
                  wrought upon them, and perchance among them.—Aha!" he said to himself, as he paced
                  up and down. "I have it! I'll try an experiment upon him!"</p>

               <head type="sub">THE SERPENT'S EXPERIMENT.</head>
               <p>FATHER FRANCESCO sat leaning his head on his hand by the window of his cell,
                  looking out upon the sea as it rose and fell, with the reflections of the fast
                  coming stars glittering like so many jewels on its breast. The glow of evening had
                  almost faded, but there was a wan, tremulous light from the moon, and a clearness
                  produced by the reflection of such an expanse of water, which still rendered
                  objects in his cell quite discernible.</p>
               <p>In the terrible denunciations and warnings just uttered, he had been preaching to
                  himself, striving to bring a force on his own soul by which he might reduce its
                  interior rebellion to submission; but, alas! when was ever love cast out by fear?
                  He knew not as yet the only remedy for such sorrow,—that there is a love celestial
                  and divine, of which earthly love in its purest form is only the sacramental
                  symbol and emblem, and that this divine love can by God's power so outflood human
                  affections as to bear the soul above all earthly idols to its only immortal rest.
                  This great truth rises like a rock amid stormy seas, and many is the sailor
                  struggling in salt and bitter waters who cannot yet believe it is to be found. A
                  few saints like Saint Augustin had reached it,—but through what buffetings, what
                  anguish!</p>
               <p>At this moment, however, there was in the heart of the father one of those
                  collapses which follow the crisis of some mortal struggle. He leaned on the
                  window-sill, exhausted and helpless.</p>
               <p>Suddenly, a kind of illusion of the senses came over him, such as is not
                  infrequent to sensitive natures in severe crises of mental anguish. He thought he
                  heard Agnes singing, as he had sometimes heard her when he had called in his
                  pastoral ministrations at the little garden and paused awhile outside that he
                  might hear her finish a favorite hymn, which, like a shy bird, she sung all the
                  more sweetly for thinking herself alone.</p>
               <p>Quite as if they were sung in his ear, and in her very tones, he heard the words
                  of Saint Bernard, which we have already introduced to our reader:— <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Jesu dulcis memoria,</l>
                        <l>Dans vera cordi gaudia:</l>
                        <l>Sed super mel et omnia</l>
                        <l>Ejus dulcis præsentia.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Jesu, spes pœnitentibus,</l>
                        <l>Quam pius es petentibus,</l>
                        <l>Quam bonus te quærentibus,</l>
                        <l>Sed quis invenientibus!"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> Soft and sweet and solemn was the illusion, as if some spirit breathed them
                  with a breath of tenderness over his soul; and he threw himself with a burst of
                  tears before the crucifix.</p>
               <p>"O Jesus, where, then, art Thou? Why must I thus suffer? She is not the one
                  altogether lovely; it is Thou,—Thou, her Creator and mine! Why, why cannot I find
                  Thee? Oh, take from my heart all other love but Thine alone!"</p>
               <p>Yet even this very prayer, this very hymn, were blent with the remembrance of
                  Agnes; for was it not she who first had taught him the lesson of heavenly love?
                  Was not she the first one who had taught him to look upward to Jesus<pb
                     n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7945-00000107"/> other than as an avenging judge? Michel
                  Angelo has embodied in a fearful painting, which now deforms the Sistine Chapel,
                  that image of stormy vengeance which a religion debased by force and fear had
                  substituted for the tender, good shepherd of earlier Christianity. It was only in
                  the heart of a lowly maiden that Christ had been made manifest to the eye of the
                  monk, as of old he was revealed to the world through a virgin. And how could he,
                  then, forget her, or cease to love her, when every prayer and hymn, every sacred
                  round of the ladder by which he must climb, was so full of memorials of her? While
                  crying and panting for the supreme, the divine, the invisible love, he found his
                  heart still craving the visible one,—the one so well known, revealing itself to
                  the senses, and bringing with it the certainty of visible companionship.</p>
               <p>As he was thus kneeling and wrestling with himself, a sudden knock at his door
                  startled him. He had made it a point, never, at any hour of the day or night, to
                  deny himself to a brother who sought him for counsel, however disagreeable the
                  person and however unreasonable the visit. He therefore rose and unbolted the
                  door, and saw Father Johannes standing with folded arms and downcast head, in an
                  attitude of composed humility.</p>
               <p>"What would you with me, brother?" he asked, calmly.</p>
               <p>"My father, I have a wrestling of mind for one of our brethren whose case I would
                  present to you."</p>
               <p>"Come in, my brother," said the Superior. At the same time he lighted a little
                  iron lamp, of antique form, such as are still in common use in that region, and
                  seating himself on the board which served for his couch, made a motion to Father
                  Johannes to be seated also.</p>
               <p>The latter sat down, eying, as he did so, the whole interior terior of the
                  apartment, so far as it was revealed by the glimmer of the taper.</p>
               <p>"Well, my son," said Father Francesco, "what is it?"</p>
               <p>"I have my doubts of the spiritual safety of Brother Bernard," said Father
                  Johannes.</p>
               <p>"Wherefore?" asked the Superior, briefly.</p>
               <p>"Holy father, you are aware of the history of the brother, and of the worldly
                  affliction that drove him to this blessed profession?"</p>
               <p>"I am," replied the Superior, with the same brevity.</p>
               <p>"He narrated it to me fully," said Father Johannes. "The maiden he was betrothed
                  to was married to another in his absence on a long journey, being craftily made to
                  suppose him dead."</p>
               <p>"I tell you I know the circumstances," said the Superior.</p>
               <p>"I merely recalled them, because, moved doubtless by your sermon, he dropped words
                  to me to-night which led me to suppose that this sinful, earthly love was not yet
                  extirpated from his soul. Of late the woman was sick and nigh unto death, and sent
                  for him."</p>
               <p>"But he did not go?" interposed Father Francesco.</p>
               <p>"No, he did not,—grace was given him thus far,—but he dropped words to me to the
                  effect, that in secret he still cherished the love of this woman; and the awful
                  words your Reverence has been speaking to us to-night have moved me with fear for
                  the youth's soul, of the which I, as an elder brother, have had some charge, and I
                  came to consult with you as to what help there might be for him."</p>
               <p>Father Francesco turned away his head a moment and there was a pause; at last he
                  said, in a tone that seemed like the throb of some deep, interior anguish,—</p>
               <p>"The Lord help him!"</p>
               <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7945-00000108"/>
               <p>"Amen!" said Father Johannes, taking keen note of the apparent emotion.</p>
               <p>"You must have experience in these matters, my father," he added, after a
                  pause,—"so many hearts have been laid open to you. I would crave to know of you
                  what you think is the safest and most certain cure for this love of woman, if once
                  it hath got possession of the heart."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Death!</emph>" said Father Francesco, after a solemn pause.</p>
               <p>"I do not understand you," said Father Johannes.</p>
               <p>"My son," said Father Francesco, rising up with an air of authority, "you do
                     <emph>not</emph> understand,—there is nothing in you by which you should
                  understand. This unhappy brother hath opened his case to me, and I have counselled
                  him all I know of prayer and fastings and watchings and mortifications. Let him
                  persevere in the same; and if all these fail, the good Lord will send the other in
                  His own time. There is an end to all things in this life, and that end shall
                  certainly come at last. Bid him persevere and hope in this.—And now, brother,"
                  added the Superior, with dignity, "if you have no other query, time flies and
                  eternity comes on,—go, watch and pray, and leave me to my prayers, also."</p>
               <p>He raised his hand with a gesture of benediction, and Father Johannes, awed in
                  spite of himself, felt impelled to leave the apartment.</p>
               <p>"Is it so, or is it not?" he said. "I cannot tell. He did seem to wince and turn
                  away his head when I proposed the case; but then he made fight at last. I cannot
                  tell whether I have got any advantage or not; but patience! we shall see!"</p>

               <head type="sub">ELSIE PUSHES HER SCHEME.</head>
               <p>THE good Father Antonio returned from his conference with the cavalier with many
                  subjects for grave pondering. This man, as he conjectured, so far from being an
                  enemy either of Church or State, was in fact in many respects in the same position
                  with his revered master,—as nearly so as the position of a layman was likely to
                  resemble that of an ecclesiastic. His denial of the Visible Church, as represented
                  by the Pope and Cardinals, sprang not from an irreverent, but from a reverent
                  spirit. To accept <emph>them</emph> as exponents of Christ and Christianity was to
                  blaspheme and traduce both, and therefore he only could be counted in the highest
                  degree Christian who stood most completely opposed to them in spirit and
                  practice.</p>
               <p>His kind and fatherly heart was interested in the brave young nobleman. He
                  sympathized fully with the situation in which he stood, and he even wished success
                  to his love; but then how was he to help him with Agnes, and above all with her
                  old grandmother, without entering on the awful task of condemning and exposing
                  that sacred authority which all the Church had so many years been taught to regard
                  as infallibly inspired? Long had all the truly spiritual members of the Church who
                  gave ear to the teachings of Savonarola felt that the nearer they followed Christ
                  the more open was their growing antagonism to the Pope and the Cardinals;<pb
                     n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7945-00000109"/> but still they hung back from the
                  responsibility of inviting the people to an open revolt.</p>
               <p>Father Antonio felt his soul deeply stirred with the news of the excommunication
                  of his saintly master; and he marvelled, as he tossed on his restless bed through
                  the night, how he was to meet the storm. He might have known, had he been able to
                  look into a crowded assembly in Florence about this time, when the unterrified
                  monk thus met the news of his excommunication:—</p>
               <p>"There have come decrees from Rome, have there? They call me a son of perdition.
                  Well, thus may you answer:—He to whom you give this name hath neither favorites
                  nor concubines, but gives himself solely to preaching Christ. His spiritual sons
                  and daughters, those who listen to his doctrine, do not pass their time in
                  infamous practices. They confess, they receive the communion, they live honestly.
                  This man gives himself up to exalt the Church of Christ: you to destroy it. The
                  time approaches for opening the secret chamber: we will give but one turn of the
                  key, and there will come out thence such an infection, such a stench of this city
                  of Rome, that the odor shall spread through all Christendom, and all the world
                  shall be sickened."</p>
               <p>But Father Antonio was of himself wholly unable to come to such a courageous
                  result, though capable of following to the death the master who should do it for
                  him. His was the true artist nature, as unfit to deal with rough human forces as a
                  bird that flies through the air is unfitted to a hand-to-hand grapple with the
                  armed forces of the lower world. There is strength in these artist natures.
                  Curious computations have been made of the immense muscular power that is brought
                  into exercise when a swallow skims so smoothly through the blue sky; but the
                  strength is of a kind unadapted to mundane uses, and needs the ether for its
                  display. Father Antonio could create the beautiful; he could warm, could elevate,
                  could comfort; and when a stronger nature went before him, he could follow with an
                  unquestioning tenderness of devotion: but he wanted the sharp, downright power of
                  mind that could cut and cleave its way through the rubbish of the past, when its
                  institutions, instead of a commodious dwelling, had come to be a loath-some
                  prison. Besides, the true artist has ever an enchanted island of his own; and when
                  this world perplexes and wearies him, he can sail far away and lay his soul down
                  to rest, as Cytherea bore the sleeping Ascanius far from the din of battle, to
                  sleep on flowers and breathe the odor of a hundred undying altars to Beauty.</p>
               <p>Therefore, after a restless night, the good monk arose in the first purple of the
                  dawn, and instinctively betook him to a review of his drawings for the shrine, as
                  a refuge from troubled thought. He took his sketch of the Madonna and Child into
                  the morning twilight and began meditating thereon, while the clouds that lined the
                  horizon were glowing rosy purple and violet with the approaching day.</p>
               <p>"See there!" he said to himself, "yonder clouds have exactly the rosy purple of
                  the cyclamen which my little Agnes loves so much;—yes, I am resolved that this
                  cloud on which our Mother standeth shall be of a cyclamen color. And there is that
                  star, like as it looked yesterday evening, when I mused upon it. Methought I could
                  see our Lady's clear brow, and the radiance of her face, and I prayed that some
                  little power might be given to show forth that which transports me."</p>
               <p>And as the monk plied his pencil, touching here and<pb n="218-219"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000110"/> there, and elaborating the outlines of his drawing,

               <p>As the monk sung, Agnes soon appeared at the door.</p>
               <p>"Ah, my little bird, you are there!" he said looking up.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Agnes, coming forward, and looking over his shoulder at his work.</p>
               <p>"Did you find that young sculptor?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"That I did,—a brave boy, too, who will row down the coast and dig us marble from

               <p>"Pietro was always a good boy," said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"Stay," said the monk, stepping into his little sleeping-room; "he sent you this
                  lily; see, I have kept it in water all night."</p>
               <p>"Poor Pietro, that was good of him!" said Agnes. "I would thank him, if I could.
                  But, uncle," she added, in a hesitating voice, "did you see anything of that—other
                  one?"</p>
               <p>"That I did, child,—and talked long with him."</p>
               <p>"Ah, uncle, is there any hope for him?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, there is hope,—great hope. In fact, he has promised to receive me again, and
                  I have hopes of leading him to the sacrament of confession, and after that"——</p>
               <p>"And then the Pope will forgive him!" said Agnes, joyfully.</p>
               <p>The face of the monk suddenly fell; he was silent, and went on retouching his
                  drawing.</p>
               <p>"Do you not think he will?" said Agnes, earnestly. "You said the Church was ever
                  ready to receive the repentant."</p>
               <p>"The True Church will receive him," said the monk, evasively; "yes, my little one,
                  there is no doubt of it."</p>
               <p>"And it is not true that he is captain of a band of robbers in the mountains?"
                  said Agnes. "May I tell Father Francesco that it is not so?"</p>
               <p>"Child, this young man hath suffered a grievous wrong and injustice; for he is
                  lord of an ancient and noble estate, out of which he hath been driven by the cruel
                  injustice of a most wicked and abominable man, the Duke di Valentinos,<ref

                  he hath been driven with his retainers to a fortress in the mountains."</p>
               <p>"But," said Agnes, with flushed cheeks, "why does not our blessed Father
                  excommunicate this wicked duke? Surely this knight hath erred; instead of taking
                  refuge in the mountains, he ought to have fled with his followers to Rome, where
                  the dear Father of the Church hath a house for all the oppressed. It must be so
                  lovely to be the father of all men, and to take in and comfort all those who are
                  distressed and sorrowful, and to right the wrongs of all that are oppressed, as
                  our dear Father at Rome doth!"</p>
               <p>The monk looked up at Agnes's clear glowing face with a sort of wondering
                  pity.</p>
               <p>"Dear little child," he said, "there is a Jerusalem above which is mother of us

               <p>Agnes felt perplexed, and looked earnestly at her uncle as he stooped over his
                  drawing, and saw that there were deep lines of anxiety on his usually clear,
                  placid face,—a look as of one who struggles mentally with some untold trouble.</p>
               <p>"Uncle," she said, hesitatingly, "may I tell Father Francesco what you have been
                  telling me of this young man?"</p>
               <p>"No, my little one,—it were not best. In fact, dear child, there be many things in
                  his case impossible to explain, even to you;—but he is not so altogether hopeless
                  as you thought; in truth, I have great hopes of him. I have admonished him to come
                  here no more, but I shall see him again this evening."</p>
               <p>Agnes wondered at the heaviness of her own little heart, as her kind old uncle
                  spoke of his coming there no more. Awhile ago she dreaded his visits as a most
                  fearful temptation, and thought perhaps he might come at any hour; now she was
                  sure he would not, and it was astonishing what a weight fell upon her.</p>
               <p>"Why am I not thankful?" she asked herself. "Why am I not joyful? Why should I
                  wish to see him again, when I should only be tempted to sinful thoughts, and when
                  my dear uncle, who can do so much for him, has his soul in charge? And what is
                  this which is so strange in his case? There is some mystery, after all,—something,
                  perhaps, which I ought not to wish to know. Ah, how little can we know of this
                  great wicked world, and of the reasons which our superiors give for their conduct!
                  It is ours humbly to obey, without a question or a doubt. Holy Mother, may I not
                  sin through a vain curiosity or self-will! May I ever say, as thou didst, 'Behold
                  the handmaid of the Lord! be it unto me according to His word!'"</p>
               <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7945-00000112"/>
               <p>And Agnes went about her morning devotions with fervent zeal, and did not see the
                  monk as he dropped the pencil, and, covering his face with his robe, seemed to
                  wrestle in some agony of prayer.</p>
               <p>"Shepherd of Israel," he said, "why hast Thou forgotten this vine of Thy planting?
                  The boar out of the wood doth waste it, the wild beast of the field doth devour
                  it. Dogs have encompassed Thy beloved; the assembly of the violent have surrounded
                  him. How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge?"</p>
               <p>"Now, really, brother," said Elsie, coming towards him, and interrupting his
                  meditations in her bustling, business way, yet speaking in a low tone that Agnes
                  should not hear,—"I want you to help me with this child in a good common-sense
                  fashion: none of your high-flying notions about saints and angels, but a little
                  good common talk for every-day people that have their bread and salt to look
                  after. The fact is, brother, this girl must be married. I went last night to talk
                  with Antonio's mother, and the way is all open as well as any living girl could
                  desire. Antonio is a trifle slow, and the high-flying hussies call him stupid; but
                  his mother says a better son never breathed, and he is as obedient to all her
                  orders now as when he was three years old. And she has laid up plenty of household
                  stuff for him, and good hard gold pieces to boot: she let me count them myself,
                  and I showed her that which I had scraped together, and she counted it, and we
                  agreed that the children that come of such a marriage would come into the world
                  with something to stand on. Now Agnes is fond of you, brother, and perhaps it
                  would be well for you to broach the subject. The fact is, when I begin to talk,
                  she gets her arms round my old neck and falls to weeping and kissing me at such a
                  rate as makes a fool of me. If the child would only be rebellious, one could do
                  something; but this love takes all the stiffness out of one's joints; and she
                  tells me she never wants a husband, and she will be content to live with me all
                  her life. The saints know it is n't for my happiness to put her out of my old
                  arms; but I can't last forever,—my old back grows weaker every year; and Antonio
                  has strong arms to defend her from all these roystering fellows who fear neither
                  God nor man, and swoop up young maids as kites do chickens. And then he is as
                  gentle and manageable as a this-year ox; Agnes can lead him by the horn,—she will
                  be a perfect queen over him; for he has been brought up to mind the women."</p>
               <p>"Well, sister," said the monk, "hath our little maid any acquaintance with this
                  man? Have they ever spoken together?"</p>
               <p>"Not much. I have never brought them to a very close acquaintance; and that is
                  what is to be done. Antonio is not much of a talker; to tell the truth, he does
                  not know as much to say as our Agnes: but the man's place is not to say fine
                  things, but to do the hard work that shall support the household."</p>
               <p>"Then Agnes hath not even seen him?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, at different times I have bid her regard him, and said to her, 'There goes a
                  proper man and a good Christian,—a man who minds his work and is obedient to his
                  old mother: such a man will make a right good husband for some girl some
                  day.'"</p>
               <p>"And did you ever see that her eye followed him with pleasure?"</p>
               <p>"No, neither him nor any other man, for my little Agnes hath no thought of that
                  kind; but, once married, she will<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7945-00000113"/> like
                  him fast enough. All I want is to have you begin the subject, and get it into her
                  head a little."</p>
               <p>Father Antonio was puzzled how to meet this direct urgency of his sister. He could
                  not explain to her his own private reasons for believing that any such attempt
                  would be utterly vain, and only bring needless distress on his little favorite. He
                  therefore answered,—</p>
               <p>"My good sister, all such thoughts lie so far out of the sphere of us monks, that
                  you could not choose a worse person for such an errand. I have never had any
                  communings with the child than touching the beautiful things of my art, and
                  concerning hymns and prayers and the lovely world of saints and angels, where they
                  neither marry nor are given in marriage; and so I should only spoil your
                  enterprise, if I should put my unskilful hand to it."</p>
               <p>"At any rate," said Elsie, "don't you approve of my plan?"</p>
               <p>"I should approve of anything that would make our dear little one safe and happy,
                  but I would not force the matter against her inclinations. You will always regret
                  it, if you make so good a child shed one needless tear. After all, sister, what
                  need of haste? 'T is a young bird yet. Why push it out of the nest? When once it
                  is gone, you will never get it back. Let the pretty one have her little day to
                  play and sing and be happy. Does she not make this garden a sort of Paradise with
                  her little ways and her sweet words? Now, my sister, these all belong to you; but,
                  once she is given to another, there is no saying what may come. One thing only may
                  you count on with certainty: that these dear days, when she is all day by your
                  side and sleeps in your bosom all night, are over,—she will belong to you no more,
                  but to a strange man who hath neither toiled nor wrought for her, and all her
                  pretty ways and dutiful thoughts must be for him."</p>
               <p>"I know it, I know it," said Elsie, with a sudden wrench of that jealous love
                  which is ever natural to strong, passionate natures. "I'm sure it is n't for my
                  own sake I urge this. I grudge him the girl. After all, he is but a stupid head.
                  What has he ever done, that such good-fortune should befall him? He ought to fall
                  down and kiss the dust of my shoes for such a gift, and I doubt me much if he will
                  ever think to do it. These men think nothing too good for them. I believe, if one
                  of the crowned saints in heaven were offered them to wife, they would think it all
                  quite natural, and not a whit less than their requirings."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, sister," said the monk, soothingly, "why press this matter? why
                  hurry? The poor little child is young; let her frisk like a lamb, and dance like a
                  butterfly, and sing her hymns every day like a bright bird. Surely the Apostle
                  saith, 'He that giveth his maid in marriage doeth well, but he that giveth her not
                  doeth better.'"</p>
               <p>"But I have opened the subject already to old Meta," said Elsie; "and if I don't
                  pursue it, she will take it into her head that her son is lightly regarded, and
                  then her back will be up, and one may lose the chance; and on the whole,
                  considering the money and the fellow, I don't know a safer way to settle the
                  girl."</p>
               <p>"Well, sister, as I have remarked," said the monk, "I could not order my speech to
                  propose anything of this kind to a young maid; I should so bungle that I might
                  spoil all. You must even propose it yourself."</p>
               <p>"I would not have undertaken it," said Elsie, "had I not been frightened by that
                  hook-nosed old kite of a cavalier that has been sailing and perching round. We are
                  two lone<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7945-00000114"/> women here, and the times are
                  unsettled, and one never knows, that hath so fair a prize, but she may be carried
                  off, and then no redress from any quarter."</p>
               <p>"You might lodge her in the convent," said the monk.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and then, the first thing I should know, they would have got her away from
                  me entirely. I have been well pleased to have her much with the sisters hitherto,
                  because it kept her from hearing the foolish talk of girls and gallants,—and such
                  a flower would have had every wasp and bee buzzing round it. But now the time is
                  coming to marry her, I much doubt these nuns. There's old Jocunda is a sensible
                  woman, who knew something of the world before she went there,—but the Mother
                  Theresa knows no more than a baby; and they would take her in, and make her as
                  white and as thin as that moon yonder now the sun has risen; and little good
                  should I have of her, for I have no vocation for the convent,—it would kill me in
                  a week. No,—she has seen enough of the convent for the present. I will even take
                  the risk of watching her myself. Little has this gallant seen of her, though he
                  has tried hard enough! But to-day I may venture to take her down with me."</p>
               <p>Father Antonio felt a little conscience-smitten in listening to these triumphant
                  assertions of old Elsie; for he knew that she would pour all her vials of wrath on
                  his head, did she know, that, owing to his absence from his little charge, the
                  dreaded invader had managed to have two interviews with her grandchild, on the
                  very spot that Elsie deemed the fortress of security; but he wisely kept his own
                  counsel, believing in the eternal value of silence. In truth, the gentle monk
                  lived so much in the unreal and celestial world of Beauty, that he was by no means
                  a skilful guide for the passes of common life. Love, other than that ethereal real
                  kind which aspires towards Paradise, was a stranger to his thoughts, and he
                  constantly erred in attributing to other people natures and purposes as unworldly
                  and spiritual as his own. Thus had he fallen, in his utter simplicity, into the
                  attitude of a go-between protecting the advances of a young lover with the shadow
                  of his monk's gown, and he became awkwardly conscious, that, if Elsie should find
                  out the whole truth, there would be no possibility of convincing her that what had
                  been done in such sacred simplicity on all sides was not the basest
                  manœuvring.</p>
               <p>Elsie took Agnes down with her to the old stand in the gateway of the town. On
                  their way, as had probably been arranged, Antonio met them. We may have introduced
                  him to the reader before, who likely enough has forgotten by this time our
                  portraiture; so we shall say again, that the man was past thirty, tall, straight,
                  well-made, even to the tapering of his well-formed limbs, as are the generality of
                  the <choice>
                     <sic>peasanty</sic>
                     <corr>peasantry</corr>
                  </choice> of that favored region. His teeth were white as sea-pearl; his cheek,
                  though swarthy, had a deep, healthy flush; and his great velvet black eyes looked
                  straight out from under their long silky lashes, just as do the eyes of the
                  beautiful oxen of his country, with a languid, changeless tranquillity, betokening
                  a good digestion, and a well-fed, kindly animal nature. He was evidently a
                  creature that had been nourished on sweet juices and developed in fair pastures,
                  under genial influences of sun and weather,—one that would draw patiently in
                  harness, if required, without troubling his handsome head how he came there, and,
                  his labor being done, would stretch his healthy body to rumination, and rest with
                  serene, even unreflecting quietude.</p>
               <p>He had been duly lectured by his mother, this morning<pb n="228-229"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000115"/> ing, on the propriety of commencing his wooing, and
                  was coming towards them with a bouquet in his hand.</p>
               <p>"See there," said Elsie,—"there is our young neighbor Antonio coming towards us.
                  There is a youth whom I am willing you should speak to,—none of your ruffian
                  gallants, but steady as an ox at his ox at his work, and as kind at the crib.
                  Happy will the girl be that gets him for a husband!"</p>
               <p>Agnes was somewhat troubled and saddened this morning, and absorbed in cares quite
                  new to her life before; but her nature was ever kindly and social, and it had been
                  laid under so many restrictions by her grandmother's close method of bringing up,
                  that it was always ready to rebound in favor of anybody to whom she allowed her to
                  show kindness. So, when the young man stopped and shyly reached forth to her a
                  knot of scarlet poppies <choice>
                     <sic>interminged</sic>
                     <corr>intermingled</corr>
                  </choice> with bright vetches and wild blue larkspurs, she took it graciously,
                  and, frankly beaming a smile into his face, said,—</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my good Antonio!" Then fastening them in the front of her
                  bodice,—"There, they are beautiful!" she said, looking up with the simple
                  satisfaction of a child.</p>
               <p>"They are not half so beautiful as you are," said the young peasant; "everybody
                  likes you."</p>
               <p>"You are very kind, I am sure," said Agnes. "I like everybody, as far as
                  grandmamma thinks it best."</p>
               <p>"I am glad of that," said Antonio, "because then I hope you will like me."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, certainly, I do; grandmamma says you are very good, and I like all good
                  people."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, pretty Agnes," said the young man, "let me carry your basket."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you don't need to; it does not tire me."</p>
               <p>"But I should like to do something for you," insisted the young man, blushing
                  deeply.</p>
               <p>"Well, you may, then," said Agnes, who began to wonder at the length of time her
                  grandmother allowed this conversation to go on without interrupting it, as she
                  generally had done when a young man was in the case. Quite to her astonishment,
                  her venerable relative, instead of sticking as close to her as her shadow, was
                  walking forward very fast without looking behind.</p>
               <p>"Now, Holy Mother," said that excellent matron, "do help this young man to bring
                  this affair out straight, and give an old woman, who has had a world of troubles,
                  a little peace in her old age!"</p>
               <p>Agnes found herself, therefore, quite unusually situated, alone in the company of
                  a handsome young man, and apparently with the consent of her grandmother. Some
                  girls might have felt emotions of embarrassment, or even alarm, at this new
                  situation; but the sacred loneliness and seclusion in which Agnes had been
                  educated had given her a confiding fearlessness, such as voyagers have found in
                  the birds of bright foreign islands which have never been invaded by man. She
                  looked up at Antonio with a pleased, admiring smile,—much such as she would have
                  given, if a great handsome stag, or other sylvan companion, had stepped from the
                  forest and looked a friendship at her through his large liquid eyes. She seemed,
                  in an innocent, frank way, to like to have him walking by her, and thought him
                  very good to carry her basket,—though, as she told him, he need not do it, it did
                  not tire her in the least.</p>
               <p>"Nor does it tire me, pretty Agnes," said he, with an embarrassed laugh. "See what
                  a great fellow I am,—how strong! Look,—I can bend an iron bar in my hands! I<pb
                     n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7945-00000116"/> am as strong as an ox,—and I should
                  like always to use my strength for you."</p>
               <p>"Should you? How very kind of you! It is very Christian to use one's strength for
                  others, like the good Saint Christopher."</p>
               <p>"But I would use my strength for you because—I love you, gentle Agnes!"</p>
               <p>"That is right, too," replied Agnes. "We must all love one another, my good
                  Antonio."</p>
               <p>"You must know what I mean," said the young man. "I mean that I want to marry
                  you."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry for that, Antonio," replied Agnes, gravely; "because I do not want to
                  marry you. I am never going to marry anybody."</p>
               <p>"Ah, girls always talk so, my mother told me; but nobody ever heard of a girl that
                  did not want a husband; that is impossible," said Antonio, with simplicity.</p>
               <p>"I believe girls generally do, Antonio; but I do not: my desire is to go to the
                  convent."</p>
               <p>"To the convent, pretty Agnes? Of all things, what should you want to go to the
                  convent for? You never had any trouble. You are young, and handsome, and healthy,
                  and almost any of the fellows would think himself fortunate to get you."</p>
               <p>"I would go there to live for God and pray for souls," said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"But your grandmother will never let you; she means you shall marry me. I heard
                  her and my mother talking about it last night; and my mother bade me come on, for
                  she said it was all settled."</p>
               <p>"I never heard anything of it," said Agnes, now for the first time feeling
                  troubled. "But, my good Antonio, if you really do like me and wish me well, you
                  will not want to distress me?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly not."</p>
               <p>"Well, it <emph>will</emph> distress me very, very much, if you persist in wanting
                  to marry me, and if you say any more on the subject."</p>
               <p>"Is that really so?" said Antonio, fixing his great velvet eyes with an honest
                  stare on Agnes.</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is so, Antonio; you may rely upon it."</p>
               <p>"But look here, Agnes, are you quite sure? Mother says girls do not always know
                  their mind."</p>
               <p>"But I know mine, Antonio. Now you really will distress and trouble me very much,
                  if you say anything more of this sort."</p>
               <p>"I declare, I am sorry for it," said the young man. "Look ye, Agnes,—I did not
                  care half as much about it this morning as I do now. Mother has been saying this
                  great while that I must have a wife, that she was getting old; and this morning
                  she told me to speak to you. I thought you would be all ready,—indeed I did."</p>
               <p>"My good Antonio, there are a great many very handsome girls who would be glad, I
                  suppose, to marry you. I believe other girls do not feel as I do. Giulietta used
                  to laugh and tell me so."</p>
               <p>"That Giulietta was a splendid girl," said Antonio. "She used to make great eyes
                  at me, and try to make me play the fool; but my mother would not hear of her. Now
                  she has gone off with a fellow to the mountains."</p>
               <p>"Giulietta gone?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, have n't you heard of it? She's gone with one of the fellows of that dashing
                  young robber-captain that has been round our town so much lately. All the girls
                  are wild<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7945-00000117"/> after these mountain fellows.
                  A good, honest boy like me, that hammers away at his trade, they think nothing of;
                  whereas one of these fellows with a feather in his cap has only to twinkle his
                  finger at them, and they are off like a bird."</p>
               <p>The blood rose in Agnes's cheeks at this very unconscious remark; but she walked
                  along for some time with a countenance of grave reflection.</p>
               <p>They had now gained the street of the city, where old Elsie stood at a little
                  distance waiting for them.</p>
               <p>"Well, Agnes," said Antonio, "so you really are in earnest?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly I am."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, let us be good friends, at any rate," said the young man.</p>
               <p>"Oh, to be sure, I will," said Agnes, smiling with all the brightness her lovely
                  face was capable of. "You are a kind, good man, and I like you very much. I will
                  always remember you kindly."</p>
               <p>"Well, good-bye, then," said Antonio, offering his hand.</p>
               <p>"Good-bye," said Agnes, cheerfully giving hers.</p>
               <p>Elsie, beholding the cordiality of this parting, comforted herself that all was
                  right, and ruffled all her feathers with the satisfied pride of a matron whose
                  family plans are succeeding.</p>
               <p>"After all," she said to herself, "brother was right,—best let young folks settle
                  these matters themselves. Now see the advantage of such an education as I have
                  given Agnes! Instead of being betrothed to a good, honest, forehanded fellow, she
                  might have been losing her poor, silly heart to some of these lords or gallants
                  who throw away a girl as one does an orange when they have sucked it. Who knows
                  what mischief this cavalier might have done, if I had not been so watchful? Now
                  let him come prying and spying about, she will have a husband to defend her. A
                  smith's hammer is better than an old woman's spindle, any day."</p>
               <p>Agnes took her seat with her usual air of thoughtful gravity, her mind seeming to
                  be intensely preoccupied, and her grandmother, though secretly exulting in the
                  supposed cause, resolved not to open the subject with her till they were at home
                  or alone at night.</p>
               <p>"I have my defence to make to Father Francesco, too," she said to herself, "for
                  hurrying on this betrothal against his advice; but one must manage a little with
                  these priests,—the saints forgive me! I really think sometimes, because they can't
                  marry themselves, they would rather see every pretty girl in a convent than with a
                  husband. It's natural enough, too. Father Francesco will be like the rest of the
                  world: when he can't help a thing, he will see the will of the Lord in it."</p>
               <p>Thus prosperously the world seemed to go with old Elsie. Meantime, when her back
                  was turned, as she was kneeling over her basket, sorting out lemons, Agnes
                  happened to look up, and there, just under the arch of the gateway, where she had
                  seen him the first time, sat the cavalier on a splendid horse, with a white
                  feather streaming backward from his black riding-hat and dark curls.</p>
               <p>He bowed low and kissed his hand to her, and before she knew it her eyes met his,
                  which seemed to flash light and sunshine all through her; and then he turned his
                  horse and was gone through the gate, while she, filled with self-reproach, was
                  taking her little heart to task for the instantaneous throb of happiness which had
                  passed through her whole being at that sight. She had not turned away her head,
                  nor said a<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7945-00000118"/> prayer, as Father Francesco
                  told her to do, because the whole thing had been sudden as a flash; but now it was
                  gone, she prayed, "My God, help me not to love him!—let me love Thee alone!" But
                  many times in the course of the day, as she twisted her flax, she found herself
                  wondering whither he could be going. Had he really gone to that enchanted
                  cloud-land, in the old purple Apennines, whither he wanted to carry her,—gone,
                  perhaps, never to return? That was best. But was he reconciled with the Church?
                  Was that great, splendid soul that looked out of those eyes to be forever lost, or
                  would the pious exhortations of her uncle avail? And then she thought he had said
                  to her, that, if she would go with him, he would confess and take the sacrament,
                  and be reconciled with the Church, and so his soul be saved.</p>
               <p>She resolved to tell this to Father Francesco. Perhaps he would——No,—she shivered
                  as she remembered the severe, withering look with which the holy father had spoken
                  of him, and the awfulness of his manner,—he would never consent. And then her
                  grandmother——No, there was no possibility.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Agnes's good old uncle sat in the orange-shaded garden, busily
                  perfecting his sketches; but his mind was distracted, and his thoughts
                  wandered,—and often he rose, and, leaving his drawings, would pace up and down the
                  little place, absorbed in earnest prayer. The thought of his master's position was
                  hourly growing upon him. The real world with its hungry and angry tide was each
                  hour washing higher and higher up on the airy shore of the ideal, and bearing the
                  pearls and enchanted shells of fancy out into its salt and muddy waters.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my master my father!" he said, "is the martyr's crown of fire indeed waiting
                  thee? Will God desert His own? But was not Christ crucified?—and the disciple is
                  not above his master, nor the servant above his lord. But surely Florence will not
                  consent. The whole city will make a stand for him;—they are ready, if need be, to
                  pluck out their eyes and give them to him. Florence will certainly be a refuge for
                  him. But why do I put confidence in man? In the Lord alone have I righteousness
                  and strength."</p>
               <p>And the old monk raised the psalm, "<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Quare fremunt
                     gentes</foreign>," and his voice rose and fell through the flowery recesses and
                  dripping grottoes of the old gorge, sad and earnest like the protest of the few
                  and feeble of Christ's own against the rushing legions of the world. Yet, as he
                  sang, courage and holy hope came into his soul from the sacred words,—just such
                  courage as they afterwards brought to Luther and to the Puritans in later
                  times.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE MONK'S DEPARTURE.</head>
               <p>THE three inhabitants of the little dovecot were sitting in their garden after
                  supper, enjoying the cool freshness. The place was perfumed with the smell of
                  orange-blossoms, brought out by gentle showers that had fallen during the latter
                  part of the afternoon, and all three felt the tranquilizing effects of the sweet
                  evening air. The monk sat bending over his drawings, resting the frame on which
                  they lay on the mossy garden-wall, so as to get the latest advantage of the rich
                  golden twilight which now twinkled through the sky. Agnes sat by him on the same
                  wall,—now glancing over his shoulder at his work, and now leaning thoughtfully on
                  her elbow, gazing pensively down into the deep shadows of the gorge, or out where
                  the golden light of evening streamed under the arches of the old Roman bridge, to
                  the wide, bright sea beyond.</p>
               <p>Old Elsie bustled about with unusual content in the lines of her keen wrinkled
                  face. Already her thoughts were running on household furnishing and bridal finery.
                  She unlocked an old chest which from its heavy quaint carvings of dark wood must
                  have been some relic of the fortunes of her better days, and, taking out of a
                  little till of the same a string of fine silvery pearls, held them up admiringly
                  to the evening light. A splendid pair of pearl ear-rings also was produced from
                  the same receptacle.</p>
               <p>She sighed at first, as she looked at these things, and then smiled with rather an
                  air of triumph, and, coming to where Agnes reclined on the wall, held them up
                  playfully before her.</p>
               <p>"See here, little one!" she said.</p>
               <p>"Oh, what pretty things!—where did they come from?" said Agnes, innocently.</p>
               <p>"Where did they? Sure enough! Little did you or any one else know old Elsie had
                  things like these! But she meant her little Agnes should hold up her head with the
                  best. No girl in Sorrento will have such wedding finery as this?"</p>
               <p>"Wedding finery, grandmamma," said Agnes, faintly,—"what does that mean?"</p>
               <p>"What does that mean, sly-boots? Ah, you know well enough! What were you and
                  Antonio talking about all the time this morning? Did he not ask you to marry
                  him?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, grandmamma; but I told him I was not going to marry. You promised me, dear
                  grandmother, right here, the other night, that I should not marry till I was
                  willing; and I told Antonio I was not willing."</p>
               <p>"The girl says but true, sister," said the monk; "you remember you gave her your
                  word that she should not be married till she gave her consent willingly."</p>
               <p>"But, Agnes, my pretty one, what can be the objection?" said old Elsie, coaxingly.
                  "Where will you find a better-made man, or more honest, or more kind?—and he is
                  handsome;—and you will have a home that all the girls will envy."</p>
               <p>"Grandmamma, remember, you promised me,—you <emph>promised</emph> me," said Agnes,
                  looking distressed, and speaking earnestly.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, child! but can't I ask a civil question, if I did? What is your
                  objection to Antonio?"</p>
               <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7945-00000120"/>
               <p>"Only that I don't want to be married."</p>
               <p>"Now you know, child," said Elsie, "I never will consent to your going to a
                  convent. You might as well put a knife through my old heart as talk to me of that.
                  And if you don't go, you must marry somebody; and who could be better than
                  Antonio?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, grandmamma, am I not a good girl? What have I done, that you are so anxious
                  to get me away from you?" said Agnes. "I like Antonio well enough, but I like you
                  ten thousand times better. Why cannot we live together just as we do now? I am
                  strong. I can work a great deal harder than I do. You ought to let me work more,
                  so that you need not work so hard and tire yourself,—let me carry the heavy
                  basket, and dig round the trees."</p>
               <p>"Pooh! a pretty story!" said Elsie. "We are two lone women, and the times are
                  unsettled; there are robbers and loose fellows about, and we want a
                  protector."</p>
               <p>"And is not the good Lord our protector?—has He not always kept us, grandmother?"
                  said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"Oh, that's well enough to say, but folks can't always get along so;—it's far
                  better trusting the Lord with a good strong man about,—like Antonio, for instance.
                  I should like to see the man that would dare be uncivil to <emph>his</emph> wife.
                  But go your ways,—it's no use toiling away one's life for children, who, after
                  all, won't turn their little finger for you."</p>
               <p>"Now, dear grandmother," said Agnes, "have I not said I would do everything for
                  you, and work hard for you? Ask me to do anything else in the world, grandmamma; I
                  will do anything to make you happy, except marry this man,—that I cannot."</p>
               <p>"And that is the only thing I want you to do. Well, I suppose I may as well lock
                  up these things; I see my gifts are not cared for."</p>
               <p>And the old soul turned and went in quite testily, leaving Agnes with a grieved
                  heart, sitting still by her uncle.</p>
               <p>"Never weep, little one," said the kind old monk, when he saw the silent tears
                  falling one after another; "your grandmother loves you, after all, and will come
                  out of this, if we are quiet."</p>
               <p>"This is such a beautiful world," said Agnes, "who would think it would be such a
                  hard one to live in?—such battles and conflicts as people have here!"</p>
               <p>"You say well, little heart; but great is the glory to be revealed; so let us have
                  courage."</p>
               <p>"Dear uncle, have you heard any ill-tidings of late?" asked Agnes. "I noticed this
                  morning you were cast down, and to-night you look so tired and sad."</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear child,—heavy tidings have indeed come. My dear master at Florence is
                  hard beset by wicked men, and in great danger,—in danger, perhaps, of falling a
                  martyr to his holy zeal for the blessed Jesus and his Church."</p>
               <p>"But cannot our holy father, the Pope, protect him? You should go to Rome directly
                  and lay the case before him."</p>
               <p>"It is not always possible to be protected by the Pope," said Father Antonio,
                  evasively. "But I grieve much, dear child, that I can be with you no longer. I
                  must gird up my loins and set out for Florence, to see with my own eyes how the
                  battle is going for my holy master."</p>
               <p>"Ah, must I lose you, too, my dear, best friend?" said Agnes. "What shall I
                  do?"</p>
               <p>"Thou hast the same Lord Jesus, and the same dear Mother, when I am gone. Have
                  faith in God, and cease not to pray for His Church,—and for me too."</p>
               <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7945-00000121"/>
               <p>"That I will, dear uncle! I will pray for you more than ever,—for prayer now will
                  be all my comfort. But," she added, with hesitation, "oh, uncle, you promised to
                  visit <emph>him!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Never fear, little Agnes,—I will do that. I go to him this very night,—now
                  even,—for the daylight waxes too scant for me to work longer."</p>
               <p>"But you will come back and stay with us to-night, uncle?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I will,—but to-morrow morning I must be up and away with the birds; and I
                  have labored hard all day to finish the drawings for the lad who shall carve the
                  shrine, that he may busy himself thereon in my absence."</p>
               <p>"Then you will come back?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, dear heart, I will come back; of that be assured. Pray God it be
                  before long, too."</p>
               <p>So saying, the good monk drew his cowl over his head, and, putting his portfolio
                  of drawings under his arm, began to wend his way towards the old town.</p>
               <p>Agnes watched him departing, her heart in a strange flutter of eagerness and
                  solicitude. What were these dreadful troubles which were coming upon her good
                  uncle?—who those enemies of the Church that beset that saintly teacher he so much
                  looked up to? And why was lawless violence allowed to run such riot in Italy, as
                  it had in the case of the unfortunate cavalier? As she thought things over, she
                  was burning with a repressed desire to <emph>do</emph> something herself to abate
                  these troubles.</p>
               <p>"I am not a knight," she said to herself, "and I cannot fight for the good cause.
                  I am not a priest, and I cannot argue for it. I cannot preach and convert sinners.
                  What, then, can I do? I can pray. Suppose I should make a pilgrimage grimage?
                  Yes,—that would be a good work, and I will. I will walk to Rome, praying at every
                  shrine and holy place; and then, when I come to the Holy City, whose very dust is
                  made precious with the blood of the martyrs and saints, I will seek the house of
                  our dear father, the Pope, and entreat his forgiveness for this poor soul. He will
                  not scorn me, for he is in the place of the blessed Jesus, and the richest
                  princess and the poorest maiden are equal in his sight. Ah, that will be
                  beautiful! Holy Mother," she said, falling on her knees before the shrine, "here I
                  vow and promise that I will go praying to the Holy City. Smile on me and help
                  me!"</p>
               <p>And by the twinkle of the flickering lamp which threw its light upon the picture,
                  Agnes thought surely the placid face brightened to a tender maternal smile, and
                  her enthusiastic imagination saw in this an omen of success.</p>
               <p>Old Elsie was moody and silent this evening,—vexed at the thwarting of her
                  schemes. It was the first time that the idea had ever gained a foothold in her
                  mind, that her docile and tractable grandchild could really have for any serious
                  length of time a will opposed to her own, and she found it even now difficult to
                  believe it. Hitherto she had shaped her life as easily as she could mould a
                  biscuit, and it was all plain sailing before her. The force and decision of this
                  young will rose as suddenly upon her as the one rock in the middle of the ocean
                  which a voyager unexpectedly discovered by striking on it.</p>
               <p>But Elsie by no means regarded the game as lost. She mentally went over the field,
                  considering here and there what was yet to be done.</p>
               <p>The subject had fairly been broached. Agnes had listened to it, and parted in
                  friendship from Antonio. Now<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7945-00000122"/> his old
                  mother must be soothed and pacified; and Antonio must be made to persevere.</p>
               <p>"What is a girl worth that can be won at the first asking?" quoth Elsie. "Depend
                  upon it, she will fall to thinking of him, and the next time she sees him she will
                  give him a good look. The girl never knew what it was to have a lover. No wonder
                  she does n't take to it at first; there's where her bringing up comes in, so
                  different from other girls'. Courage, Elsie! Nature will speak in its own
                  time."</p>
               <p>Thus soliloquizing, she prepared to go a few steps from their dwelling, to the
                  cottage of Meta and Antonio, which was situated at no great distance.</p>
               <p>"Nobody will think of coming here this time o' night," she said, "and the girl is
                  in for a good hour at least with her prayers, and so I think I may venture. I
                  don't really like to leave her, but it's not a great way, and I shall be back in a
                  few moments. I want just to put a word into old Meta's ear, that she may teach
                  Antonio how to demean himself."</p>
               <p>And so the old soul took her spinning and away she went, leaving Agnes absorbed in
                  her devotions.</p>
               <p>The solemn starry night looked down steadfastly on the little garden. The evening
                  wind creeping with gentle stir among the orange-leaves, and the falling waters of
                  the fountain dripping their distant, solitary way down from rock to rock through
                  the lonely gorge, were the only sounds that broke the stillness.</p>
               <p>The monk was the first of the two to return; for those accustomed to the habits of
                  elderly cronies on a gossiping expedition of any domestic importance will not be
                  surprised that Elsie's few moments of projected talk lengthened imperceptibly into
                  hours.</p>
               <p>Agnes came forward anxiously to meet her uncle. He seemed wan and haggard, and
                  trembling with some recent emotion.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter with you, dear uncle?" she asked. "Has anything happened?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, child, nothing. I have only been talking on painful subjects, deep
                  perplexities, out of which I can scarcely see my way. Would to God this night of
                  life were past, and I could see morning on the mountains!"</p>
               <p>"My uncle, have you not, then, succeeded in bringing this young man to the bosom
                  of the True Church?"</p>
               <p>"Child, the way is hedged up, and made almost impassable by difficulties you
                  little wot of. They cannot be told to you; they are enough to destroy the faith of
                  the very elect."</p>
               <p>Agnes's heart sank within her; and the monk, sitting down on the wall of the
                  garden, clasped his hands over one knee and gazed fixedly before him.</p>
               <p>The sight of her uncle,—generally so cheerful, so elastic, so full of bright
                  thoughts and beautiful words,—so utterly cast down, was both a mystery and a
                  terror to Agnes.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my uncle," she said, "it is hard that I must not know, and that I can do
                  nothing, when I feel ready to die for this cause! What is one little life? Ah, if
                  I had a thousand to give, I could melt them all into it, like little drops of rain
                  in the sea! Be not utterly cast down, good uncle! Does not our dear Lord and
                  Saviour reign in the heavens yet?"</p>
               <p>"Sweet little nightingale!" said the monk, stretching his hand towards her. "Well
                  did my master say that he gained strength to his soul always by talking with
                  Christ's little children!"</p>
               <p>"And all the dear saints and angels, they are not dead or<pb n="244-245"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000123"/> idle either," said Agnes, her face kindling; "they
                  are busy all around us. I know not what this trouble is you speak of; but let us
                  think what legions of bright angels and holy men and women are caring for us."</p>
               <p>"Well said, well said, dear child! There is, thank God, a Church Triumphant,—a
                  crowned queen, a glorious bride; and the poor, struggling Church Militant shall
                  rise to join her! What matter, then, though our way lie through dungeon and
                  chains, through fire and sword, if we may attain to that glory at last?"</p>
               <p>"Uncle, are there such dreadful things really before you?"</p>
               <p>"There may be, child. I say of my master, as did the holy Apostles: 'Let us also
                  go, that we may die with him.' I feel a heavy presage. But I must not trouble you,
                  child. Early in the morning I will be up and away. I go with this youth, whose
                  pathway lies a certain distance along mine, and whose company I seek for his good
                  as well as my pleasure."</p>
               <p>"You go with <emph>him?</emph>" said Agnes, with a start of surprise.</p>
               <p>"Yes; his refuge in the mountains lies between here and Rome, and he hath kindly
                  offered to bring me on my way faster than I can go on foot; and I would fain see
                  our beautiful Florence as soon as may be. O Florence, Florence, Lily of Italy!
                  wilt thou let thy prophet perish?"</p>
               <p>"But, uncle, if he die for the faith, he will be a blessed martyr. That crown is
                  worth dying for," said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"You say well, little one,—you say well! '<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Ex oribus
                     parvulorum</foreign>.' But one shrinks from that in the person of a friend
                  which one could cheerfully welcome for one's self. Oh, the blessed cross! never is
                  it welcome to the flesh, and yet how joyfully the spirit may walk under it!"</p>
               <p>"Dear uncle, I have made a solemn vow before our Holy Mother this night," said
                  Agnes, "to go on a pilgrimage to Rome, and at every shrine and holy place to pray
                  that these great afflictions which beset all of you may have a happy issue."</p>
               <p>"My sweet heart, what have you done? Have you considered the unsettled roads, the
                  wild, unruly men that are abroad, the robbers with which the mountains are
                  filled?"</p>
               <p>"These are all Christ's children and my brothers," said Agnes; "for them was the
                  most holy blood shed, as well as for me. They cannot harm one who prays for
                  them."</p>
               <p>"But, dear heart of mine, these ungodly brawlers think little of prayer; and this
                  beautiful, innocent little face will but move the vilest and most brutal thoughts
                  and deeds."</p>
               <p>"Saint Agnes still lives, dear uncle,—and He who kept her in worse trial. I shall
                  walk through them all pure as snow,—I am assured I shall. The star which led the
                  wise men and stood over the young child and his mother will lead me, too."</p>
               <p>"But your grandmother?"</p>
               <p>"The Lord will incline her heart to go with me. Dear uncle, it does not beseem a
                  child to reflect on its elders, yet I cannot but see that grandmamma loves this
                  world and me too well for her soul's good. This journey will be for her eternal
                  repose."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, dear one, I cannot now advise. Take advice of your confessor, and the
                  blessed Lord and his holy Mother be with you! But come now, I would soothe myself
                  to sleep; for I have need of good rest to-night. Let us sing together our dear
                  master's hymn of the Cross."</p>
               <p>And the monk and the maiden sung together:—<pb n="246-247"

               <p>As the monk sung, his soul seemed to fuse itself into the sentiment with that
                  natural grace peculiar to his nation. He walked up and down the little garden,
                  apparently forgetful of Agnes or of any earthly presence, and in the last verses
                  stretched his hands towards heaven with streaming tears and a fervor of utterance
                  indescribable.</p>
               <p>The soft and passionate tenderness of the Italian words must exhale in an English
                  translation, but enough may remain to show that the hymns with which Savonarola at
                  this time sowed the mind of Italy often mingled the Moravian quaintness and energy
                  with the Wesleyan purity and tenderness. One of the great means of popular reform
                  which he proposed was the supplanting of the obscene and licentious songs, which
                  at that time so generally defiled the minds of the young, by religious words and
                  melodies. The<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7945-00000125"/> children and young people
                  brought up under his influence were sedulously stored with treasures of sacred
                  melody, as the safest companions of leisure hours, and the surest guard against
                  temptation.</p>
               <p>"Come now, my little one," said the monk, after they had ceased singing, as he
                  laid his hand on Agnes's head. "I am strong now; I know where I stand. And you, my
                  little one, you are one of my master's 'Children of the Cross.' You must sing the
                  hymns of our dear master, that I have taught you, when I am far away. A hymn is a
                  singing angel, and goes walking through the earth, scattering the devils before
                  it. Therefore he who creates hymns imitates the most excellent and lovely works of
                  our Lord God, who made the angels. These hymns watch our chamber-door, they sit
                  upon our pillow, they sing to us when we awake; and therefore our master was
                  resolved to sow the minds of his young people with them, as our lovely Italy is
                  sown with the seeds of all colored flowers. How lovely has it often been to me, as
                  I sat at my work in Florence, to hear the little children go by, chanting of Jesus
                  and Mary,—and young men singing to young maidens, not vain flatteries of their
                  beauty, but the praises of the One only Beautiful, whose smile sows heaven with
                  stars like flowers! Ah, in my day I have seen blessed times in Florence! Truly was
                  she worthy to be called the Lily City!—for all her care seemed to be to make white
                  her garments to receive her Lord and Bridegroom. Yes, though she had sinned like
                  the Magdalen, yet she loved much, like her. She washed His feet with her tears,
                  and wiped them with the hair of her head. Oh, my beautiful Florence, be true to
                  thy vows, be true to thy Lord and Governor, Jesus Christ, and all shall be
                  well!"</p>
               <p>"Amen, dear uncle!" said Agnes. "I will not fail to pray day and night, that thus
                  it may be. And now, if you must travel so far, you must go to rest. Grandmamma has
                  gone long ago. I saw her steal by as we were singing."</p>
               <p>"And is there any message from my little Agnes to this young man?" asked the
                  monk.</p>
               <p>"Yes. Say to him that Agnes prays daily that he may be a worthy son and soldier of
                  the Lord Jesus."</p>
               <p>"Amen, sweet heart! Jesu and His sweet Mother bless thee!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE PENANCE.</head>
               <p>THE course of our story requires us to return to the Capuchin convent, and to the
                  struggles and trials of its Superior; for in his hands is the irresistible
                  authority which must direct the future life of Agnes.</p>
               <p>From no guilty compliances, no heedless running into temptation, had he come to
                  love her. The temptation had met him in the direct path of duty; the poison had
                  been breathed in with the perfume of sweetest and most life-giving flowers: nor
                  could he shun that temptation, nor cease to inhale that fatal sweetness, without
                  confessing himself vanquished in a point where, in his view, to yield was to be
                  lost. The subtle and deceitful visit of Father Johannes to his cell had the effect
                  of thoroughly rousing him to a complete sense of his position, and making him feel
                  the immediate, absolute necessity of bringing all the energy of his will, all the
                  resources of his nature to bear on its present difficulties. For he felt, by a
                  fine intuition, that already he was watched and suspected;—any faltering step now,
                  any wavering, any change in his mode of treating his female penitents, would be
                  maliciously noted. The military education of his early days had still left in his
                  mind a strong residuum of personal courage and honor, which made him regard it as
                  dastardly to flee when he ought to conquer, and therefore he set his face as a
                  flint for victory.</p>
               <p>But reviewing his interior world, and taking a survey of the work before him, he
                  felt that sense of a divided personality which often becomes so vivid in the
                  history of individuals of strong will and passion. It seemed to him that there
                  were two men within him: the one turbulent, passionate, demented; the other vainly
                  endeavoring by authority, reason, and conscience to bring the rebel to subjection.
                  The discipline of conventual life, the extraordinary austerities to which he had
                  condemned himself, the monotonous solitude of his existence, all tended to exalt
                  the vivacity of the nervous system, which, in the Italian constitution, is at all
                  times disproportionately developed; and when those weird harp-strings of the
                  nerves are once thoroughly unstrung, the fury and tempest of the discord sometimes
                  utterly bewilders the most practised self-government.</p>
               <p>But he felt that <emph>something</emph> must be done with himself, and done
                  immediately; for in a few days he must again meet Agnes at the confessional. He
                  must meet her, not with weak tremblings and passionate fears, but calm as Fate,
                  inexorable as the Judgment-Day. He must hear her confession, not as man, but as
                  God; he must pronounce his judgments with a divine dispassionateness. He must dive
                  into the recesses of her secret heart, and, following with subtile analysis all
                  the fine courses of those fibres which were feeling their blind way towards an
                  earthly love, must tear them remorselessly away. Well could he warn her of the
                  insidiousness of earthly affections; better than any one else he could show her
                  how a name that was blended with her prayers and borne before the sacred shrine in
                  her most retired and solemn hours might at last come to fill all her heart with a
                  presence too dangerously dear. He must direct her gaze up those mystical heights
                  where an unearthly marriage awaited<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7945-00000127"/>
                  her, its sealed and spiritual bride; he must hurry her footsteps onward to the
                  irrevocable issue.</p>
               <p>All this was before him. But ere it could be done, he must subdue himself,—he must
                  become calm and pulseless, in deadly resolve; and what prayer, what penance might
                  avail for this? If all that he had already tried had so miserably failed, what
                  hope? He resolved to quit for a season all human society, and enter upon one of
                  those desolate periods of retreat from earthly converse well known in the annals
                  of saintship as most prolific in spiritual victories.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, on the day after the conversation with Father Johannes, he startled
                  the monks by announcing to them that he was going to leave them for several
                  days.</p>
               <p>"My brothers," he said, "the weight of a fearful penance is laid upon me, which I
                  must work out alone. I leave you to-day, and charge you not to seek to follow my
                  footsteps; but, as you hope to escape hell, watch and wrestle for me and
                  yourselves during the time I am gone. Before many days <choice>
                     <sic>I I</sic>
                     <corr>I</corr>
                  </choice> hope to return to you with renewed spiritual strength."</p>
               <p>That evening, while Agnes and her uncle were sitting together in their
                  orange-garden, mingling their parting prayers and hymns, scenes of a very
                  different description surrounded the Father Francesco.</p>
               <p>One who looks on the flowery fields and blue seas of this enchanting region thinks
                  that the Isles of the Blest could scarcely find on earth a more fitting image; nor
                  can he realize, till experience proves it to him, that he is in the immediate
                  vicinity of a weird and dreary region which might represent no less the goblin
                  horrors of the damned.</p>
               <p>Around the foot of Vesuvius lie fair villages and villas garlanded with roses and
                  flushing with grapes whose juice gains warmth from the breathing of its
                  subterraneous fires, while just above them rises a region more awful than can be
                  created by the action of any common causes of sterility. There, immense tracts
                  sloping gradually upward show a desolation so peculiar, so utterly unlike every
                  common solitude of Nature, that one enters upon it with the shudder we give at
                  that which is wholly unnatural. On all sides are gigantic serpent convolutions of
                  black lava, their immense folds rolled into every conceivable contortion, as if,
                  in their fiery agonies, they had struggled and wreathed and knotted together, and
                  then grown cold and black with the imperishable signs of those terrific
                  convulsions upon them. Not a blade of grass, not a flower, not even the hardiest
                  lichen, springs up to relieve the utter deathliness of the scene. The eye wanders
                  from one black, shapeless mass to another, and there is ever the same suggestion
                  of hideous monster life,—of goblin convulsions and strange fiend-like agonies in
                  some age gone by. One's very footsteps have an unnatural, metallic clink, and
                  one's garments brushing over the rough surface are torn and fretted by its sharp,
                  remorseless touch,—as if its very nature were so pitiless and acrid that the
                  slightest contact revealed it.</p>
               <p>The sun was just setting over the beautiful Bay of Naples,—with its enchanted
                  islands, its jewelled city, its flowery villages, all bedecked and bedropped with
                  strange shiftings and flushes of prismatic light and shade, as if they belonged to
                  some fairy-land of perpetual festivity and singing,—when Father Francesco stopped
                  in his toilsome ascent up the mountain, and seating himself on ropy ridges of
                  black lava, looked down on the peaceful landscape.</p>
               <p>Above his head, behind him, rose the black cone of the mountain, over whose top
                  the lazy clouds of thin white smoke were floating, tinged with the evening light;
                  around him, the desolate convulsed waste,—so arid, so supernaturally<pb
                     n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7945-00000128"/> dreary; and below, like a soft
                  enchanted dream, the beautiful bay, the gleaming white villas and towers, the
                  picturesque islands, the gliding sails, flecked and streaked and dyed with the
                  violet and pink and purple of the evening sky. The thin new moon and one
                  glittering star trembled through the rosy air.</p>
               <p>The monk wiped from his brow the sweat that had been caused by the toil of his
                  hurried journey, and listened to the bells of the Ave Maria pealing from the
                  different churches of Naples, filling the atmosphere with a soft tremble of solemn
                  dropping sound, as if spirits in the air took up and repeated over and over the
                  angelic salutation which a thousand earthly lips were just then uttering.
                  Mechanically he joined in the invocation which at that moment united the hearts of
                  all Christians, and as the words passed his lips, he thought, with a sad, desolate
                  longing, of the hour of death of which they spake.</p>
               <p>"It must come at last," he said. "Life is but a moment. Why am I so cowardly? why
                  so unwilling to suffer and to struggle? Am I a warrior of the Lord, and do I
                  shrink from the toils of the camp, and long for the ease of the court before I
                  have earned it? Why do we clamor for happiness? Why should we sinners be happy?
                  And yet, O God, why is the world made so lovely as it lies there, why so
                  rejoicing, and so girt with splendor and beauty, if we are never to enjoy it? If
                  penance and toil were all we were sent here for, why not make a world grim and
                  desolate as this around me?—then there would be nothing to seduce us. But our path
                  is a constant fight; Nature is made only to be resisted; we must walk the sharp
                  blade of the sword over the fiery chasm to Paradise. Come, then!—no shrinking!—let
                  me turn my back on everything dear and beautiful, as now on this landscape!"</p>
               <p>He rose and commenced the perpendicular ascent of the cone, stumbling and climbing
                  over the huge sliding blocks of broken lava, which grated and crunched beneath his
                  feet with a harsh metallic ring. Sometimes a broken fragment or two would go
                  tinkling down the rough path behind him, and sometimes it seemed as if the whole
                  loose black mass from above were about to slide, like an avalanche, down upon his
                  head;—he almost hoped it would. Sometimes he would stop, overcome by the toil of
                  the ascent, and seat himself for a moment on a black fragment, and then his eye
                  would wander over the wide and peaceful panorama below. He seemed to himself like
                  a fly perched upon some little roughness of a perpendicular wall, and felt a
                  strange airy sense of pleasure in being thus between earth and heaven. A sense of
                  relief, of beauty, and peacefulness would steal over him, as if he were indeed
                  something disfranchised and disembodied, a part of the harmonious and beautiful
                  world that lay stretched out beneath him; in a moment more he would waken himself
                  with a start, and resume his toilsome journey with a sullen and dogged
                  perseverance.</p>
               <p>At last he gained the top of the mountain,—that weird, strange region where the
                  loose, hot soil, crumbling beneath his feet, was no honest foodful mother-earth,
                  but an acrid mass of ashes and corrosive minerals. Arsenic, sulphur, and many a
                  sharp and bitter salt were in all he touched, every rift in the ground hissed with
                  stifling steam, while rolling clouds of dun sullen smoke, and a deep hollow
                  booming, like the roar of an immense furnace, told his nearness to the great
                  crater. He penetrated the sombre tabernacle, and stood on the very brink of a huge
                  basin, formed by a wall of rocks around a sunken plain, in the midst of which rose
                  the black cone of the subterraneous furnace, which crackled and roared<pb
                     n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7945-00000129"/> and from time to time spit up burning
                  stones and cinders or oozed out slow ropy streams of liquid fire.</p>
               <p>The sulphurous cliffs were dyed in many a brilliant shade of brown and orange by
                  the admixture of various ores, but their brightness seemed strange and unnatural,
                  and the dizzying whirls of vapor, now enveloping the whole scene in gloom, now
                  lifting in this spot and now in that, seemed to magnify the dismal pit to an
                  indefinite size. Now and then there would come up from the very entrails of the
                  mountain a sort of convulsed sob of hollow sound, and the earth would quiver
                  beneath his feet, and fragments from the surrounding rocks would scale off and
                  fall with crashing reverberations into the depth beneath; at such moments it would
                  seem as if the very mountain were about to crush in and bear him down in its
                  ruins.</p>
               <p>Father Francesco, though blinded by the smoke and choked by the vapor, could not
                  be content without descending into the abyss and exploring the very <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">penetralia</foreign> of its mysteries. Steadying his way by
                  means of a cord which he fastened to a firm projecting rock, he began slowly and
                  painfully clambering downward. The wind was sweeping across the chasm from behind,
                  bearing the noxious vapors away from him, or he must inevitably have been stifled.
                  It took him some little time, however, to effect his descent; but at length he
                  found himself fairly landed on the dark floor of the gloomy enclosure.</p>
               <p>The ropy, pitch-black undulations of lava yawned here and there in red-hot cracks
                  and seams, making it appear to be only a crust over some fathomless depth of
                  molten fire, whose moanings and boilings could be heard below. These dark
                  congealed billows creaked and bent as the monk stepped upon them, and burned his
                  feet through his coarse sandals; yet he stumbled on. Now and then his foot would
                  crush in, where the lava had hardened in a thinner crust, and he would draw it
                  suddenly back from the lurid red-hot metal beneath. The staff on which he rested
                  was constantly kindling into a light blaze as it slipped into some heated hollow,
                  and he was fain to beat out the fire upon the cooler surface. Still he went on
                  half-stifled by the hot and pungent vapor, but drawn by that painful, unnatural
                  curiosity which possesses one in a nightmare dream. The great cone in the centre
                  was the point to which he wished to attain,—the nearest point which man can gain
                  to this eternal mystery of fire. It was trembling with a perpetual vibration, a
                  hollow, pulsating undertone of sound like the surging of the sea before a storm,
                  and the lava that boiled over its sides rolled slowly down with a strange
                  creaking; it seemed the condensed, intensified essence and expression of eternal
                  fire, rising and still rising from some inexhaustible fountain of burning.</p>
               <p>Father Francesco drew as near as he could for the stifling heat and vapor, and,
                  resting on his staff, stood gazing intently. The lurid light of the fire fell with
                  an unearthly glare on his pale, sunken features, his wild, haggard eyes, and his
                  torn and disarranged garments. In the awful solitude and silence of the night he
                  felt his heart stand still, as if indeed he had touched with his very hand the
                  gates of eternal woe, and felt its fiery breath upon his cheek. He half-imagined
                  that the seams and clefts which glowed in lurid lines between the dark billows
                  would gape yet wider and show the blasting secrets of some world of fiery despair
                  below. He fancied that he heard behind and around the mocking laugh of fiends, and
                  that confused clamor of mingled shrieks and lamentations which Dante describes as
                     filling<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7945-00000130"/> ing the dusky approaches to
                  that forlorn realm where hope never enters.</p>
               <p>"Ah, God," he exclaimed, "for this vain life of man! They eat, they drink, they
                  dance, they sing, they marry and are given in marriage, they have castles and
                  gardens and villas, and the very beauty of Paradise seems over it all,—and yet how
                  close by burns and roars the eternal fire! Fools that we are, to clamor for
                  indulgence and happiness in this life, when the question is, to escape everlasting
                  burnings! If I tremble at this outer court of God's wrath and justice, what must
                  be the fires of hell? These are but earthly fires; they can but burn the body:
                  those are made to burn the soul; they are undying as the soul is. What would it be
                  to be dragged down, down, down, into an abyss of soul-fire hotter than this for
                  ages on ages? This might bring merciful death in time: that will have no end."</p>
               <p>The monk fell on his knees and breathed out piercing supplications. Every nerve
                  and fibre within him seemed tense with his agony of prayer. It was not the outcry
                  for purity and peace, not a tender longing for forgiveness, not a filial remorse
                  for sin, but the nervous anguish of him who shrieks in the immediate apprehension
                  of an unendurable torture. It was the cry of a man upon the rack, the despairing
                  scream of him who feels himself sinking in a burning dwelling. Such anguish has
                  found an utterance in Stradella's celebrated "Pietà, Signore," which still tells
                  to our ears, in its wild moans and piteous shrieks, the religious conceptions of
                  his day; for there is no phase of the Italian mind that has not found expression
                  in its music.</p>
               <p>When the oppression of the heat and sulphurous vapor became too dreadful to be
                  borne, the monk retraced his way and climbed with difficulty up the steep sides of
                  the crater, till he gained the summit above, where a comparatively free air
                  revived him. All night he wandered up and down in that dreary vicinity, now
                  listening to the mournful roar and crackle of the fire, and now raising his voice
                  in penitential psalms or the notes of that terrific "Dies Iræ" which sums up all
                  the intense fear and horror with which the religion of the Middle Ages clothed the
                  idea of the final catastrophe of humanity. Sometimes prostrating himself with his
                  face towards the stifling soil, he prayed with agonized intensity till Nature
                  would sink in a temporary collapse, and sleep, in spite of himself, would steal
                  over him.</p>
               <p>So waned the gloomy hours of the night away, till the morning broke in the east,
                  turning all the blue wavering floor of the sea to crimson brightness, and bringing
                  up, with the rising breeze, the barking of dogs, the lowing of kine, the songs of
                  laborers and boatmen, all fresh and breezy from the repose of the past night.</p>
               <p>Father Francesco heard the sound of approaching footsteps climbing the lava path,
                  and started with a nervous trepidation. Soon he recognized a poor peasant of the
                  vicinity, whose child he had tended during a dangerous illness. He bore with him a
                  little basket of eggs, with a melon and a fresh green salad.</p>
               <p>"Good-morning, holy father," he said, bowing humbly. "I saw you coming this way
                  last night, and I could hardly sleep for thinking of you; and my good woman,
                  Teresina, would have it that I should come out to look after you. I have taken the
                  liberty to bring a little offering;—it was the best we had."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my son," said the monk, looking wistfully at the fresh, honest face of
                  the peasant. "You have taken<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7945-00000131"/> too much
                  trouble for such a sinner. I must not allow myself such indulgences."</p>
               <p>"But your Reverence must live. Look you," said the peasant, "at least your
                  reverence will take an egg. See here, how handily I can cook one," he added,
                  striking his stick into a little cavity of a rock, from which, as from an
                  escape-valve, hissed a jet of hot steam,—"see here, I nestle the egg in this
                  little cleft, and it will be done in a twinkling. Our good God gives us our fire
                  for nothing here."</p>
               <p>There was something wholesomely kindly and cheerful in the action and expression
                  of the man, which broke upon the overstrained and disturbed musings of the monk
                  like daylight on a ghastly dream. The honest, loving heart sees love in
                  everything; even the fire is its fatherly helper, and not its avenging enemy.</p>
               <p>Father Francesco took the egg, when it was done, with a silent gesture of
                  thanks.</p>
               <p>"If I might make bold to say," said the peasant, encouraged, "your Reverence
                  should have some care for yourself. If a man will not feed himself, the good God
                  will not feed him; and we poor people have too few friends already to let such as
                  you die. Your hands are trembling, and you look worn out. Surely you should take
                  something more, for the very love of the poor."</p>
               <p>"My son, I am bound to do a heavy penance, and to work out a great conflict. I
                  thank you for your undeserved kindness. Leave me now to myself, and come no more
                  to disturb my prayers. Go, and God bless you!"</p>
               <p>"Well," said the peasant, putting down the basket and melon, "I shall leave these
                  things here, any way, and I beg your Reverence to have a care of yourself.
                  Teresina fretted all night for fear something might come to you. The
                     bambino<foreign xml:lang="ITA">bino</foreign> that you cured is grown a stout
                  little fellow, and eats enough for two,—and it is all of you; so she cannot forget
                  it. She is a busy little woman, is Teresina; and when she gets a thought in her
                  head, it buzzes, buzzes, like a fly in a bottle, and she will have it your
                  Reverence is killing yourself by inches, and says she, 'What will all the poor do
                  when he is gone?' So your Reverence must pardon us. We mean it all for the
                  best."</p>
               <p>So saying, the man turned and began sliding and slipping down the steep ashy sides
                  of the mountain cone with a dexterity which carried him to the bottom in a few
                  moments; and on he went, sending back after him a cheerful little air, the refrain
                  of which is still to be heard in our days in that neighborhood. A word or two of
                  the gay song fluttered back on the ear of the monk,— <q>
                     <l>"Tutta gioja, tutta festa."</l>
                  </q> So gay and airy it was in its ringing cadence that it seemed a musical laugh
                  springing from sunny skies, and came fluttering into the dismal smoke and gloom of
                  the mountain-top like a very butterfly of sound. It struck on the sad, leaden ear
                  of the monk much as we might fancy the carol of a robin over a grave might seem,
                  could the cold sleeper below wake one moment to its perception. If it woke one
                  regretful sigh and drew one wandering look downward to the elysian paradise that
                  lay smiling at the foot of the mountain, he instantly suppressed the feeling, and
                  set his face in its old deathly stillness.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">CLOUDS DEEPENING.</head>
               <p>AFTER the departure of her uncle to Florence, the life of Agnes was troubled and
                  harassed from a variety of causes.</p>
               <p>First, her grandmother was sulky and moody, and though saying nothing directly on
                  the topic nearest her heart, yet intimating by every look and action that she
                  considered Agnes as a most ungrateful and contumacious child. Then there was a
                  constant internal perplexity,—a constant wearying course of self-interrogation and
                  self-distrust, the pain of a sensitive spirit which doubts at every moment whether
                  it may not be falling into sin. The absence of her kind uncle at this time took
                  from her the strongest support on which she had leaned in her perplexities.
                  Cheerful, airy, and elastic in his temperament, always full of fresh-springing and
                  beautiful thoughts, as an Italian dell is of flowers, the charming old man seemed,
                  while he stayed with Agnes, to be the door of a new and fairer world, where she
                  could walk in air and sunshine, and find utterance for a thousand thoughts and
                  feelings which at all other times lay in cold repression in her heart. His
                  counsels were always so wholesome, his sympathies so quick, his devotion so
                  fervent and cheerful, that while with him Agnes felt the burden of her life
                  insensibly lifted and carried for her as by some angel guide.</p>
               <p>Now they had all come back upon her, heavier a thousand-fold sand-fold than ever
                  they had been before. Never did she so much need counsel and guidance,—never had
                  she so much within herself to be solved and made plain to her own comprehension;
                  yet she thought with a strange shiver of her next visit to her confessor. That
                  austere man, so chilling, so awful, so far above all conception of human
                  weaknesses, how should she dare to lay before him all the secrets of her breast,
                  especially when she must confess to having disobeyed his most stringent commands?
                  She had had another interview with this forbidden son of perdition, but how it was
                  she knew not. How could such things have happened? Instead of shutting her eyes
                  and turning her head and saying prayers, she had listened to a passionate
                  declaration of love, and his last word had called her his wife. Her heart thrilled
                  every time she thought of it; and somehow she could not feel sure that it was
                  exactly a thrill of penitence. It was all like a strange dream to her; and
                  sometimes she looked at her little brown hands and wondered if he really had
                  kissed them,—he, the splendid strange vision of a man, the prince from fairy-land!
                  Agnes had never read romances, it is true, but she had been brought up on the
                  legends of the saints, and there never was a marvel possible to human conception
                  that had not been told there. Princes had come from China and Barbary and
                  Abyssinia and every other strange out-of-the-way place, to kneel at the feet of
                  fair, obdurate saints who would not even turn the head to look at them; but she
                  had acted, she was conscious, after a much more mortal fashion, and so made
                  herself work for confession and penance. Yet certainly she had not meant to do so;
                  the interview came on her so suddenly, so unexpectedly; and somehow he
                     <emph>would</emph> speak, and he would not go when she asked him to; and<pb
                     n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7945-00000133"/> she remembered how he looked when he
                  stood right before her in the door-way and told her she <emph>should</emph> hear
                  him,—how the color flushed up in his cheeks, what a fire there was in his great
                  dark eyes; he looked as if he were going to do something desperate then; it made
                  her hold her breath even now to think of it.</p>
               <p>"These princes and nobles," she thought, "are so used to command, it is no wonder
                  they make us feel as if they must have their will. I have heard grandmother call
                  them wolves and vultures, that are ready to tear us poor folk to pieces; but I am
                  sure he seems gentle. I'm sure it is n't wicked or cruel for him to want to make
                  me his wife; and he could n't know, of course, why it was n't right he should; and
                  it really is beautiful of him to love me so. Oh, if I were only a princess, and he
                  loved me that way, how glad I should be to give up everything and go to him alone!
                  And then we would pray together; and I really think that would be much better than
                  praying all alone. He said men had so much more to tempt them. Ah, that is true!
                  How can little moles that grub in the ground know of the dangers of eagles that
                  fly to the very sun? Holy Mother, look mercifully upon him and save his soul!"</p>
               <p>Such were the thoughts of Agnes the day when she was preparing for her confession;
                  and all the way to church she found them floating and dissolving and reappearing
                  in new forms in her mind, like the silvery smoke-clouds which were constantly
                  veering and sailing over Vesuvius.</p>
               <p>Only one thing was firm and never changing, and that was the purpose to reveal
                  everything to her spiritual director. When she kneeled at the confessional with
                  closed eyes, and began her whispered acknowledgements, she tried to feel as if she
                  were speaking in the ear of God alone,—that God whose spirit she was taught to
                  believe, for the time being, was present in His minister before whom her inmost
                  heart was to be unveiled.</p>
               <p>He who sat within had just returned from his lonely retreat with his mind and
                  nerves in a state of unnatural tension,—a sort of ecstatic clearness and calmness,
                  which he mistook for victory and peace. During those lonely days when he had
                  wandered afar from human converse, and was surrounded only by objects of
                  desolation and gloom, he had passed through as many phases of strange, unnatural
                  experience as there were flitting smoke-wreaths eddying about him.</p>
               <p>There are depths in man's nature and his possibilities which no plummet has ever
                  sounded,—the wild, lonely joys of fanatical excitement, the perfectly ravenous
                  appetite for self-torture, which seems able, in time, to reverse the whole human
                  system, and make a heaven of hell. How else can we understand the facts related
                  both in Hindoo and in Christian story, of those men and women who have found such
                  strange raptures in slow tortures, prolonged from year to year, till pain became a
                  habit of body and mind? It is said, that, after the tortures of the rack, the
                  reaction of the overstrained nerves produces a sense of the most exquisite relief
                  and repose; and so when mind and body are harrowed, harassed to the very outer
                  verge of endurance, come wild throbbings and transports, and strange celestial
                  clairvoyance, which the mystic hails as the descent of the New Jerusalem into his
                  soul.</p>
               <p>It had seemed to Father Francesco, when he came down from the mountain, that he
                  had left his body behind him,—that he had left earth and earthly things; his very
                  feet touching the ground seemed to tread not on rough, resisting soil, but upon
                  elastic cloud. He saw a strange excess of beauty<pb n="266-267"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000134"/> in every flower, in every leaf, in the wavering
                  blue of the sea, in the red grottoed rocks that overhung the shore, with their
                  purple, green, orange, and yellow hangings of flower-and-leaf-tapestry. The songs
                  of the fishermen on the beach, the peasant-girls cutting flowery fodder for the
                  cattle, all seemed to him to have an unnatural charm. As one looking through a
                  prism sees a fine bordering of rainbow on every object, so he beheld a glorified
                  world. His former self seemed to him something forever past and gone. He looked at
                  himself as at another person, who had sinned and suffered, and was now resting in
                  beatified repose; and he fondly thought all this was firm reality, and believed
                  that he was now proof against all earthly impressions, able to hear and to judge
                  with the dispassionate calmness of a disembodied spirit. He did not know that this
                  high-strung calmness, this fine clearness, were only the most intense forms of
                  nervous sensibility, and as vividly susceptible to every mortal impression as is
                  the vitalized chemical plate to the least action of the sun's rays.</p>
               <p>When Agnes began her confession, her voice seemed to him to pass through every
                  nerve; it seemed as if he could feel her presence thrilling through the very wood
                  of the confessional. He was astonished and dismayed at his own emotion. But when
                  she began to speak of the interview with the cavalier, he trembled from head to
                  foot with uncontrollable passion. Nature long repressed came back in a tempestuous
                  reaction. He crossed himself again and again, he tried to pray, and blessed those
                  protecting shadows which concealed his emotion from the unconscious one by his
                  side. But he set his teeth in deadly resolve, and his voice, as he questioned her,
                  came forth cutting and cold as ice crystals.</p>
               <p>"Why did you listen to a word?"</p>
               <p>"My father, it was so sudden. He wakened me from sleep. I answered him before I
                  thought."</p>
               <p>"You should not have been sleeping. It was a sinful indolence."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my father."</p>
               <p>"See now to what it led. The enemy of your soul, ever watching, seized this moment
                  to tempt you."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my father."</p>
               <p>"Examine your soul well," said Father Francesco, in a tone of austere severity
                  that made Agnes tremble. "Did you not find a secret pleasure in his words?"</p>
               <p>"My father, I fear I did," said she, with a trembling voice.</p>
               <p>"I knew it! I knew it!" the priest muttered to himself, while the great drops
                  started on his forehead, in the intensity of the conflict he repressed. Agnes
                  thought the solemn pause that followed was caused by the horror that had been
                  inspired by her own sinfulness.</p>
               <p>"You did not, then, heartily and truly wish him to go from you?" pursued the cold,
                  severe voice.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my father, I did. I wished him to go with all my soul."</p>
               <p>"Yet you say you found pleasure in his being near you," said Father Francesco,
                  conscious how every string of his own being, even in this awful hour, was
                  vibrating with a sort of desperate, miserable joy in being once more near to
                  her.</p>
               <p>"Ah," sighed Agnes, "that is true, my father,—woe is me! Please tell me how I
                  could have helped it. I was pleased before I knew it."</p>
               <p>"And you have been thinking of what he said to you<pb n="268-269"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000135"/> with pleasure since?" pursued the confessor, with
                  an intense severity of manner, deepening as he spoke.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>have</emph> thought of it," faltered Agnes.</p>
               <p>"Beware how you trifle with the holy sacrament! Answer frankly. You have thought
                  of it <emph>with pleasure</emph>. Confess it."</p>
               <p>"I do not understand myself exactly," said Agnes. "I have thought of it partly
                  with pleasure and partly with pain."</p>
               <p>"Would you like to go with him and be his wife, as he said?"</p>
               <p>"If it were right, father,—not otherwise."</p>
               <p>"Oh, foolish child! oh, blinded soul! to think of right in connection with an
                  infidel and heretic! Do you not see that all this is an artifice of Satan? He can
                  transform himself into an angel of light. Do you suppose this heretic would be
                  brought back to the Church by a foolish girl? Do you suppose it is your prayers he
                  wants? Why does he not seek the prayers of the Church,—of holy men who have power
                  with God? He would bait his hook with this pretence that he may catch your soul.
                  Do you believe me?"</p>
               <p>"I am bound to believe you, my father."</p>
               <p>"But you do not. Your heart is going after this wicked man."</p>
               <p>"Oh, my father, I do not wish it should. I never wish or expect to see him more. I
                  only pray for him that his soul may not be lost."</p>
               <p>"He has gone, then?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my father. And he went with my uncle, a most holy monk, who has undertaken
                  the work of his salvation. He listens to my uncle, who has hopes of restoring him
                  to the Church."</p>
               <p>"That is well. And now, my daughter, listen to me. You must root out of your
                  thought every trace and remembrance of these words of sinful earthly love which he
                  hath spoken. Such love would burn your soul to all eternity with fire that never
                  could be quenched. If you can tear away all roots and traces of this from your
                  heart, if by fasting and prayer and penance you can become worthy to be a bride of
                  your divine Lord, then your prayers will gain power, and you may prevail to secure
                  his eternal salvation. But listen to me, daughter,—listen and tremble! If ever you
                  should yield to his love and turn back from this heavenly marriage to follow him,
                  you will accomplish his damnation and your own; to all eternity he will curse you,
                  while the fire rages and consumes him,—he will curse the hour that he first saw
                  you."</p>
               <p>These words were spoken with an intense vehemence which seemed almost
                  supernatural. Agnes shivered and trembled; a vague feeling of guilt overwhelmed
                  and disheartened her; she seemed to herself the most lost and abandoned of human
                  beings.</p>
               <p>"My father, I shall think no penance too severe that may restore my soul from this
                  sin. I have already made a vow to the blessed Mother that I will walk on foot to
                  the Holy City, praying in every shrine and holy place; and I humbly ask your
                  approval."</p>
               <p>This announcement brought to the mind of the monk a sense of relief and
                  deliverance. He felt already, in the terrible storm of agitation which this
                  confession had aroused within him, that nature was not dead, and that he was
                  infinitely farther from the victory of passionless calm than he had supposed. He
                  was still a man,—torn with human passions, with a love which he must never
                  express, and a<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7945-00000136"/> jealousy which burned
                  and writhed at every word which he had wrung from its unconscious object.
                  Conscience had begun to whisper in his ear that there would be no safety to him in
                  continuing this spiritual dictatorship to one whose every word unmanned him,—that
                  it was laying himself open to a ceaseless temptation, which in some blinded,
                  dreary hour of evil might hurry him into acts of horrible sacrilege; and he was
                  once more feeling that wild, stormy revolt of his inner nature that so distressed
                  him before he left the convent.</p>
               <p>This proposition of Agnes' struck him as a compromise. It would take her from him
                  only for a season, she would go under his care and direction, and he would
                  gradually recover his calmness and self-possession in her absence. Her pilgrimage
                  to the holy places would be a most proper and fit preparation for the solemn
                  marriage-rite which should forever sunder her from all human ties, and make her
                  inaccessible to all solicitations of human love. Therefore, after an interval of
                  silence, he answered,—</p>
               <p>"Daughter, your plan is approved. Such pilgrimages have ever been held meritorious
                  works in the Church, and there is a special blessing upon them."</p>
               <p>"My father," said Agnes, "it has always been in my heart from my childhood to be
                  the bride of the Lord; but my grandmother, who brought me up, and to whom I owe
                  the obedience of a daughter, utterly forbids me: she will not hear a word of it.
                  No longer ago than last Monday she told me I might as well put a knife into her
                  heart as speak of this."</p>
               <p>"And you, daughter, do you put the feelings of any earthly friend before the love
                  of your Lord and Creator who laid down His life for you? Hear what He saith:— 'He
                  that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me.'"</p>
               <p>"But my poor old grandmother has no one but me in the world, and she has never
                  slept a night without me; she is getting old, and she has worked for me all her
                  good days;—it would be very hard for her to lose me."</p>
               <p>"Ah, false, deceitful heart! Has, then, thy Lord not labored for thee? Has He not
                  borne thee through all the years of thy life? And wilt thou put the love of any
                  mortal before His?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Agnes, with a sort of hardy sweetness,—"but my Lord does not need
                  me as grandmother does; He is in glory, and will never be old or feeble; I cannot
                  work for Him and tend Him as I shall her. I cannot see my way clear at present;
                  but when she is gone, or if the saints move her to consent, I shall then belong to
                  God alone."</p>
               <p>"Daughter, there is some truth in your words; and if your Lord accepts you, He
                  will dispose her heart. Will she go with you on this pilgrimage?"</p>
               <p>"I have prayed that she might, father,—that her soul may be quickened; for I fear
                  me, dear old grandmamma has found her love for me a snare,—she has thought too
                  much of my interests and too little of her own soul, poor grandmamma!"</p>
               <p>"Well, child, I shall enjoin this pilgrimage on her as a penance."</p>
               <p>"I have grievously offended her lately," said Agnes, "in rejecting an offer of
                  marriage with a man on whom she had set her heart, and therefore she does not
                  listen to me as she is wont to do."</p>
               <p>"You have done right in refusing, my daughter. I will speak to her of this, and
                  show her how great is the sin of<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7945-00000137"/>
                  opposing a holy vocation in a soul whom the Lord calls to Himself, and enjoin her
                  to make reparation by uniting with you in this holy work."</p>
               <p>Agnes departed from the confessional without even looking upon the face of her
                  director, who sat within listening to the rustle of her dress as she
                  rose,—listening to the soft fall of her departing footsteps, and praying that
                  grace might be given him not to look after her: and he did not, though he felt as
                  if his life were going with her.</p>
               <p>Agnes tripped round the aisle to a little side-chapel where a light was always
                  kept burning by her before a picture of Saint Agnes, and, kneeling there, waited
                  till her grandmother should be through with her confession.</p>
               <p>"Ah, sweet Saint Agnes," she said, "pity me! I am a poor ignorant young girl, and
                  have been led into grievous sin; but I did not mean to do wrong,—I have been
                  trying to do right; pray for me, that I may overcome as you did. Pray our dear
                  Lord to send you with us on this pilgrimage, and save us from all wicked and
                  brutal men who would do us harm. As the Lord delivered you in sorest straits,
                  keeping soul and body pure as a lily, ah, pray Him to keep me! I love you
                  dearly,—watch over me and guide me."</p>
               <p>In those days of the Church, such addresses to the glorified saints had become
                  common among all Christians. They were not regarded as worship, any more than a
                  similar outpouring of confidence to a beloved and revered friend yet in the body.
                  Among the hymns of Savonarola is one addressed to Saint Mary Magdalen, whom he
                  regarded with an especial veneration. The great truth, that God is not the God of
                  the dead, but of the living, that <emph>all</emph> live to Him, was in those ages
                  with the truly religious a part of spiritual consciousness. The saints of the
                  Church Triumphant, having ing become one with Christ as he is one with the Father,
                  were regarded as invested with a portion of his divinity, and as the ministering
                  agency through which his mediatorial government on earth was conducted; and it was
                  thought to be in the power of the sympathetic heart to attract them by the outflow
                  of its affections, so that their presence often overshadowed the walks of daily
                  life with a cloud of healing and protecting sweetness.</p>
               <p>If the enthusiasm of devotion in regard to these invisible friends became
                  extravagant and took the language due to God alone, it was no more than the fervid
                  Italian nature was always doing with regard to visible objects of affection. Love
                  with an Italian always tends to become worship, and some of the language of the
                  poets addressed to earthly loves rises into intensities of expression due only to
                  the One, Sovereign, Eternal Beauty. One sees even in the writings of Cicero that
                  this passionate adoring kind of love is not confined to modern times. When he
                  loses the daughter in whom his heart is garnered up, he finds no comfort except in
                  building a temple to her memory,—a blind outreaching towards the saint-worship of
                  modern times.</p>
               <p>Agnes rose from her devotions, and went with downcast eyes, her lips still
                  repeating prayers, to the font of holy water, which was in a dim shadowy corner,
                  where a painted window cast a gold and violet twilight. Suddenly there was a
                  rustle of garments in the dimness, and a jewelled hand essayed to pass holy water
                  to her on the tip of its finger. This mark of Christian fraternity, common in
                  those times, Agnes almost mechanically accepted, touching her slender finger to
                  the one extended, and making the sign of the cross, while she raised her eyes to
                  see who stood there. Gradually the haze cleared from her mind, and she awoke to
                  the consciousness<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7945-00000138"/> sciousness that it
                  was the cavalier! He moved to come towards her, with a bright smile on his face;
                  but suddenly she became pale as one who has seen a spectre, and, pushing from her
                  with both hands, she said faintly, "Go, go!" and turned and sped up the aisle
                  silently as a sunbeam, joining her grandmother, who was coming from the
                  confessional with a gloomy and sullen brow.</p>
               <p>Old Elsie had been enjoined to unite with her grandchild in this scheme of a
                  pilgrimage, and received the direction with as much internal contumacy as would a
                  thriving church-member of Wall Street a proposition to attend a protracted meeting
                  in the height of the business season. Not but that pilgrimages were holy and
                  gracious works,—she was too good a Christian not to admit that,—but why must holy
                  and gracious works be thrust on her in particular? There were saints enough who
                  liked such things; and people <emph>could</emph> get to heaven without,—if not
                  with a very abundant entrance, still in a modest way,—and Elsie's ambition for
                  position and treasure in the spiritual world was of a very moderate cast.</p>
               <p>"Well, now, I hope you are satisfied," she said to Agnes, as she pulled her along
                  with no very gentle hand; "you've got me sent off on a pilgrimage,—and my old
                  bones must be rattling up and down all the hills between here and Rome,—and who's
                  to see to the oranges?—they'll all be stolen, every one."</p>
               <p>"Grandmother," began Agnes in a pleading voice——</p>
               <p>"Oh, you hush up! I know what you're going to say: 'The good Lord will take care
                  of them.' I wish He may! He has His hands full, with all the people that go cawing
                  and psalm-singing like so many crows, and leave all their affairs to Him!"</p>
               <p>Agnes walked along disconsolate, with her eyes full of tears, which coursed one
                  another down her pale cheeks.</p>
               <p>"There's Antonio," pursued Elsie, "would perhaps look after things a little. He is
                  a good fellow, and only yesterday was asking if he could n't do something for us.
                  It's you he does it for,—but little you care who loves you, or what they do for
                  you!"</p>
               <p>At this moment they met old Jocunda, whom we have before introduced to the reader
                  as portress of the Convent. She had on her arm a large square basket, which she
                  was storing for its practical uses.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, Saint Agnes be praised, I have found you at last," she said. "I was
                  wanting to speak about some of your blood-oranges for conserving. An order has
                  come down from our dear gracious lady, the Queen, to prepare a lot for her own
                  blessed eating, and you may be sure I would get none of anybody but you.—But
                  what's this, my little heart, my little lamb?—crying?—tears in those sweet eyes?
                  What's the matter now?"</p>
               <p>"Matter enough for me!" said Elsie. "It's a weary world we live in. A body can't
                  turn any way and not meet with trouble. If a body brings up a girl one way, why,
                  every fellow is after her, and one has no peace; and if a body brings her up
                  another way, she gets her head in the clouds, and there's no good of her in this
                  world. Now look at that girl,—does n't everybody say it's time she were
                  married?—but no marrying for her! Nothing will do but we must off to Rome on a
                  pilgrimage,—and what's the good of that, I want to know? If it's praying that's to
                  be done, the dear saints know she's at it from morning till night,—and lately
                  she's up and down three or four times a night with some prayer or other."</p>
               <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7945-00000139"/>
               <p>"Well, well," said Jocunda, "who started this idea?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Father Francesco and she got it up between them,—and nothing will do but I
                  must go, too."</p>
               <p>"Well, now, after all, my dear," said Jocunda, "do you know, I made a pilgrimage
                  once, and it is n't so bad. One gets a good deal by it, first and last. Everybody
                  drops something into your hand as you go, and one gets treated as if one were
                  somebody a little above the common; and then in Rome one has a princess or a
                  duchess or some noble lady who washes one's feet, and gives one a good supper, and
                  perhaps a new suit of clothes, and all that,—and ten to one there comes a pretty
                  little sum of money to boot, if one plays one's cards well. A pilgrimage is n't
                  bad, after all;—one sees a world of fine things, and something new every day."</p>
               <p>"But who is to look after our garden and dress our trees?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, now, there's Antonio, and old Meta his mother," said Jocunda, with a knowing
                  wink at Agnes. "I fancy there are friends there that would lend a hand to keep
                  things together against the little one comes home. If one is going to be married,
                  a pilgrimage brings good luck in the family. All the saints take it kindly that
                  one comes so far to see them, and are more ready to do a good turn for one when
                  one needs it. The blessed saints are like other folks,—they like to be treated
                  with proper attention."</p>
               <p>This view of pilgrimages from the material stand-point had more effect on the mind
                  of Elsie than the most elaborate appeals of Father Francesco. She began to
                  acquiesce, though with a reluctant air.</p>
               <p>Jocunda, seeing her words had made some impression, pursued her advantage on the
                  spiritual ground.</p>
               <p>"To be sure," she added, "I don't know how it is with you; but I know that
                     <emph>I</emph> have, one way and another, rolled up quite an account of sins in
                  my life. When I was tramping up and down with my old man through the country,—now
                  in this castle and then in that camp, and now and then in at the sacking of a city
                  or village, or something of the kind,—the saints forgive us!—it does seem as if
                  one got into things that were not of the best sort, in such times. It's true, it's
                  been wiped out over and over by the priest; but then a pilgrimage is a good thing
                  to make all sure, in case one's good works should fall short of one's sins at
                  last. I can tell you, a pilgrimage is a good round weight to throw into the scale;
                  and when it comes to heaven and hell, you know, my dear, why, one cannot be too
                  careful."</p>
               <p>"Well, that may be true enough," said Elsie,—"though, as to my sins, I have tried
                  to keep them regularly squared up and balanced as I went along. I have always been
                  regular at confession, and never failed a jot or tittle in what the holy father
                  told me. But there may be something in what you say; one can't be too sure; and so
                  I'll e'en school my old bones into taking this tramp."</p>
               <p>That evening, as Agnes was sitting in the garden at sunset, her grandmother
                  bustling in and out, talking, groaning, and hurrying in her preparations for the
                  anticipated undertaking, suddenly there was a rustling in the branches overhead,
                  and a bouquet of rose-buds fell at her feet. Agnes picked it up, and saw a scrip
                  of paper coiled among the flowers. In a moment remembering the apparition of the
                  cavalier in the church in the morning, she doubted not from whom it came. So
                  dreadful had been the effect of the scene at the confessional, that the thought of
                  the near presence of her lover brought only terror. She turned pale;<pb
                     n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7945-00000140"/> her hands shook. She shut her eyes, and
                  prayed that she might not be left to read the paper; and then, summoning all her
                  resolution, she threw the bouquet with force over the wall. It dropped down, down,
                  down the gloomy, shadowy abyss, and was lost in the damp caverns below.</p>
               <p>The cavalier stood without the wall, waiting for some responsive signal in reply
                  to his missive. It had never occurred to him that Agnes would not even read it,
                  and he stood confounded when he saw it thrown back with such apparent rudeness. He
                  remembered her pale, terrified look on seeing him in the morning. It was not
                  indifference or dislike, but mortal fear, that had been shown in that pale
                  face.</p>
               <p>"These wretches are practising on her," he said, in wrath,—"filling her head with
                  frightful images, and torturing her sensitive conscience till she sees sin in the
                  most natural and innocent feelings."</p>
               <p>He had learned from Father Antonio the intention of Agnes to go on a pilgrimage,
                  and he longed to see and talk with her, that he might offer her his protection
                  against dangers which he understood far better than she. It had never even
                  occurred to him that the door for all possible communication would be thus
                  suddenly barred in his face.</p>
               <p>"Very well," he said to himself, with a darkening brow,—"let them have it their
                  own way here. She must pass through my dominions before she can reach Rome, and I
                  will find a place where I <emph>can</emph> be heard, without priest or grandmother
                  to let or hinder. She is mine, and I will care for her."</p>
               <p>But poor Agnes had the woman's share of the misery to bear, in the fear and
                  self-reproach and distress which every movement of this kind cost her. The
                  involuntary thrill at seeing her lover, at hearing from him, the conscious
                  struggle which it cost her to throw back his gift, were all noted by her accusing
                  conscience as so many sins. The next day she sought again her confessor, and began
                  an entrance on those darker and more chilly paths of penance, by which, according
                  to the opinion of her times, the peculiarly elect of the Lord were supposed to be
                  best trained. Hitherto her religion had been the cheerful and natural expression
                  of her tender and devout nature according to the more beautiful and engaging
                  devotional forms of her Church. During the year when her confessor had been,
                  unconsciously to himself, led by her instead of leading, her spiritual food had
                  been its beautiful old hymns and prayers, which she found no weariness in often
                  repeating. But now an unnatural conflict was begun in her mind, directed by a
                  spiritual guide in whom every natural and normal movement of the soul had given
                  way before a succession of morbid and unhealthful experiences. From that day Agnes
                  wore upon her heart one of those sharp instruments of torture which in those times
                  were supposed to be a means of inward grace,—a cross with seven steel points for
                  the seven sorrows of Mary. She fasted with a severity which alarmed her
                  grandmother, who in her inmost heart cursed the day that ever she had placed her
                  in the way of saintship.</p>
               <p>"All this will just end in spoiling her beauty,—making her as thin as a
                  shadow,"—said Elsie; "and she was good enough before."</p>
               <p>But it did not spoil her beauty,—it only changed its character. The roundness and
                  bloom melted away,—but there came in their stead that solemn, transparent
                  clearness of countenance, that spiritual light and radiance, which the old
                  Florentine painters gave to their Madonnas.</p>
               <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7945-00000141"/>
               <p>It is singular how all religious exercises and appliances take the character of
                  the nature that uses them. The pain and penance, which so many in her day bore as
                  a cowardly expedient for averting divine wrath, seemed, as she viewed them, a
                  humble way of becoming associated in the sufferings of her Redeemer. "<foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">Jesu dulcis memoria</foreign>," was the thought that carried a
                  redeeming sweetness with every pain. Could she thus, by suffering with her Lord,
                  gain power like Him to save,—a power which should save that soul so dear and so
                  endangered! "Ah," she thought, "I would give my life-blood, drop by drop, if only
                  it might avail for his salvation!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <head type="sub">FLORENCE AND HER PROPHET.</head>
               <p>IT was drawing towards evening, as two travellers, approaching Florence from the
                  south, checked their course on the summit of one of the circle of hills which
                  command a view of the city, and seemed to look down upon it with admiration. One
                  of these was our old friend Father Antonio, and the other the cavalier. The former
                  was mounted on an ambling mule, whose easy pace suited well with his meditative
                  habits; while the other reined in a high-mettled steed, who, though now somewhat
                  jaded under the fatigue of a long journey, showed by a series of little lively
                  motions of his ears and tail, and by pawing the ground impatiently, that he had
                  the inexhaustible stock of spirits which goes with good blood.</p>
               <p>"There she lies, my Florence," said the monk, stretching his hands out with
                  enthusiasm. "Is she not indeed a sheltered lily growing fair among the hollows of
                  the mountains? Little she may be, Sir, compared to old Rome; but every inch of her
                  is a gem,—every inch!"</p>
               <p>And, in truth, the scene was worthy of the artist's enthusiasm. All the
                  overhanging hills that encircle the city with their silvery olive-gardens and
                  their pearl-white villas were now lighted up with evening glory. The old gray
                  walls of the convents of San Miniato and the Monte Oliveto were touched with
                  yellow; and even the black obelisks of the cypresses in their cemeteries had here
                  and there streaks and<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7945-00000142"/> dots of gold,
                  fluttering like bright birds among their gloomy branches. The distant snow-peaks
                  of the Apennines, which even in spring long wear their icy mantles, were
                  shimmering and changing like an opal ring with tints of violet, green, blue, and
                  rose, blended in inexpressible softness by that dreamy haze which forms the
                  peculiar feature of Italian skies.</p>
               <p>In this loving embrace of mountains lay the city, divided by the Arno as by a line
                  of rosy crystal barred by the graceful arches of its bridges. Amid the crowd of
                  palaces and spires and towers rose central and conspicuous the great Duomo, just
                  crowned with that magnificent dome which was then considered a novelty and a
                  marvel in architecture, and which Michel Angelo looked longingly back upon when he
                  was going to Rome to build that more wondrous orb of Saint Peter's. White and
                  stately by its side shot up the airy shaft of the Campanile; and the violet vapor
                  swathing the whole city in a tender indistinctness, these two striking objects,
                  rising by their magnitude far above it, seemed to stand alone in a sort of airy
                  grandeur.</p>
               <p>And now the bells of the churches were sounding the Ave Maria, filling the air
                  with sweet and solemn vibrations, as if angels were passing to and fro over head,
                  harping as they went; and ever and anon the great bell of the Campanile came
                  pulsing in with a throb of sound of a quality so different that one hushed one's
                  breath to hear. It might be fancied to be the voice of one of those kingly
                  archangels that one sees drawn by the old Florentine religious artists,—a voice
                  grave and unearthly, and with a plaintive undertone of divine mystery.</p>
               <p>The monk and the cavalier bent low in their saddles, and seemed to join devoutly
                  in the worship of the hour.</p>
               <p>One need not wonder at the enthusiasm of the returning pilgrim of those days for
                  the city of his love, who feels the charm that lingers around that beautiful place
                  even in modern times. Never was there a spot to which the heart could insensibly
                  grow with a more home-like affection,—never one more thoroughly consecrated in
                  every stone by the sacred touch of genius.</p>
               <p>A republic, in the midst of contending elements, the history of Florence, in the
                  Middle Ages, was a history of what shoots and blossoms the Italian nature might
                  send forth, when rooted in the rich soil of liberty. It was a city of poets and
                  artists. Its statesmen, its merchants, its common artisans, and the very monks in
                  its convents, were all pervaded by one spirit. The men of Florence in its best
                  days were men of a large, grave, earnest mould. What the Puritans of New England
                  wrought out with severest earnestness in their reasonings and their lives these
                  early Puritans of Italy embodied in poetry, sculpture, and painting. They built
                  their Cathedral and their Campanile, as the Jews of old built their Temple, with
                  awe and religious fear, that they might thus express by costly and imperishable
                  monuments their sense of God's majesty and beauty. The modern traveller who visits
                  the churches and convents of Florence, or the museums where are preserved the
                  fading remains of its early religious Art, if he be a person of any sensibility,
                  cannot fail to be affected with the intense gravity and earnestness which pervade
                  them. They seem less to be paintings for the embellishment of life than eloquent
                  picture-writing by which burning religious souls sought to preach the truths of
                  the invisible world to the eye of the multitude. Through all the deficiencies of
                  perspective, coloring, and outline incident to the childhood and early youth of
                  Art, one feels the<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7945-00000143"/> passionate purpose
                  of some lofty soul to express ideas of patience, self-sacrifice, adoration, and
                  aspiration far transcending the limits of mortal capability.</p>
               <p>The angels and celestial beings of these grave old painters are as different from
                  the fat little pink Cupids or lovely laughing children of Titian and Correggio as
                  are the sermons of President Edwards from the love-songs of Tom Moore. These old
                  seers of the pencil give you grave, radiant beings, strong as man, fine as woman,
                  sweeping downward in lines of floating undulation, and seeming by the ease with
                  which they remain poised in the air to feel none of that earthly attraction which
                  draws material bodies earthward. Whether they wear the morning star on their
                  forehead, or bear the lily or the sword in their hand, there is still that
                  suggestion of mystery and power about them, that air of dignity and repose, that
                  speak the children of a nobler race than ours. One could well believe such a being
                  might pass in his serene poised majesty of motion through the walls of a gross
                  material dwelling without deranging one graceful fold of his swaying robe or
                  unclasping the hands folded quietly on his bosom. Well has a modern master of art
                  and style said of these old artists, "Many pictures are ostentatious exhibitions
                  of the artist's power of speech, the clear and vigorous elocution of useless and
                  senseless words; while the earlier efforts of Giotto and Cimabue are the burning
                  messages of prophecy delivered by the stammering lips of infants."</p>
               <p>But at the time we write, Florence had passed through her ages of primitive
                  religious and republican simplicity, and was fast hastening to her downfall. The
                  genius, energy, and prophetic enthusiasm of Savonarola had made, it is true, a
                  desperate rally on the verge of the precipice; but no one man has ever power to
                  turn back the downward slide of a whole generation.</p>
               <p>When Father Antonio left Sorrento in company with the cavalier, it was the
                  intention of the latter to go with him only so far as their respective routes
                  should lie together. The band under the command of Agostino was posted in a ruined
                  fortress in one of those airily perched old mountain-towns which form so
                  picturesque and characteristic a feature of the Italian landscape. But before they
                  reached this spot, the simple, poetic, guileless monk, with his fresh artistic
                  nature, had so won upon his travelling companion that a most enthusiastic
                  friendship had sprung up between them, and Agostino could not find it in his heart
                  at once to separate from him. Tempest-tossed and homeless, burning with a sense of
                  wrong, alienated from the faith of his fathers through his intellect and moral
                  sense, yet clinging to it with his memory and imagination, he found in the tender
                  devotional fervor of the artist monk a reconciling and healing power. He shared,
                  too, in no small degree, the feelings which now possessed the breast of his
                  companion for the great reformer whose purpose seemed to meditate nothing less
                  than the restoration of the Church of Italy to the primitive apostolic simplicity.
                  He longed to see him,—to listen to the eloquence of which he had heard so much.
                  Then, too, he had thoughts that but vaguely shaped themselves in his mind. This
                  noble man, so brave and courageous, menaced by the forces of a cruel tyranny,
                  might he not need the protection of a good sword? He recollected, too, that he had
                  an uncle high in the favor of the King of France, to whom he had written a full
                  account of his own situation. Might he not be of use in urging this uncle to
                  induce the French King to throw before Savonarola the shield of his protection<pb
                     n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7945-00000144"/> tion? At all events, he entered
                  Florence this evening with the burning zeal of a young neophyte who hopes to
                  effect something himself for a glorious and sacred cause embodied in a leader who
                  commands his deepest veneration.</p>
               <p>"My son," said Father Antonio, as they raised their heads after the evening
                  prayer, "I am at this time like a man who, having long been away from his home,
                  fears, on returning, that he shall hear some evil tidings of those he hath left. I
                  long, yet dread, to go to my dear Father Girolamo and the beloved brothers in our
                  house. There is a presage that lies heavy on my heart, so that I cannot shake it
                  off. Look at our glorious old Duomo;—doth she not sit there among the houses and
                  palaces as a queen-mother among nations,—worthy, in her greatness and beauty, to
                  represent the Church of the New Jerusalem, the Bride of the Lord? Ah, I have seen
                  it thronged and pressed with the multitude who came to crave the bread of life
                  from our master!"</p>
               <p>"Courage, my friend!" said Agostino; "it cannot be that Florence will suffer her
                  pride and glory to be trodden down. Let us hasten on, for the shades of evening
                  are coming fast, and there is a keen wind sweeping down from your snowy
                  mountains."</p>
               <p>And the two soon found themselves plunging into the shadows of the streets,
                  threading their devious way to the convent.</p>
               <p>At length they drew up before a dark wall, where the Father Antonio rung a
                  bell.</p>
               <p>A door was immediately opened, a cowled head appeared, and a cautious voice
                  asked,—</p>
               <p>"Who is there?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, is that you, good Brother Angelo?" said Father Antonio, cheerily.</p>
               <p>"And is it you, dear Brother Antonio? Come in! come in!" was the cordial response,
                  as the two passed into the court; "truly, it will make all our hearts leap to see
                  you."</p>
               <p>"And, Brother Angelo, how is our dear father? I have been so anxious about
                  him!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, fear not!—he sustains himself in God, and is full of sweetness to us
                  all."</p>
               <p>"But do the people stand by him, Angelo, and the Signoria?"</p>
               <p>"He has strong friends as yet, but his enemies are like ravening wolves. The Pope
                  hath set on the Franciscans, and they hunt him as dogs do a good stag.—But whom
                  have you here with you?" added the monk, raising his torch and regarding the
                  knight.</p>
               <p>"Fear him not; he is a brave knight and good Christian, who comes to offer his
                  sword to our father and seek his counsels."</p>
               <p>"He shall be welcome," said the porter, cheerfully. "We will have you into the
                  refectory forthwith, for you must be hungry."</p>
               <p>The young cavalier, following the flickering torch of his conductor, had only a
                  dim notion of long cloistered corridors, out of which now and then, as the light
                  flared by, came a golden gleam from some quaint old painting, where the pure angel
                  forms of Angelico stood in the gravity of an immortal youth, or the Madonna, like
                  a bending lily, awaited the message of Heaven; but when they entered the
                  refectory, a cheerful voice addressed them, and Father Antonio was clasped in the
                  embrace of the father so much beloved.</p>
               <p>"Welcome, welcome, my dear son!" said that rich voice which had thrilled so many
                  thousand Italian hearts with its<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7945-00000145"/> music.
                  "So you are come back to the fold again. How goes the good work of the Lord?"</p>
               <p>"Well, everywhere," said Father Antonio; and then, recollecting his young friend,
                  he suddenly turned and said,—</p>
               <p>"Let me present to you one son who comes to seek your instructions,—the young
                  Signor Agostino, of the noble house of Sarelli."</p>
               <p>The Superior turned to Agostino with a movement full of a generous frankness, and
                  warmly extended his hand, at the same time fixing upon him the mesmeric glance of
                  a pair of large, deep blue eyes, which might, on slight observation, have been
                  mistaken for black, so great was their depth and brilliancy.</p>
               <p>Agostino surveyed his new acquaintance with that mingling of ingenuous respect and
                  curiosity with which an ardent young man would regard the most distinguished
                  leader of his age, and felt drawn to him by a certain atmosphere of vital
                  cordiality such as one can feel better than describe.</p>
               <p>"You have ridden far to-day, my son,—you must be weary," said the Superior,
                  affably,—"but here you must feel yourself at home; command us in anything we can
                  do for you. The brothers will attend to those refreshments which are needed after
                  so long a journey; and when you have rested and supped, we shall hope to see you a
                  little more quietly."</p>
               <p>So saying, he signed to one or two brothers who stood by, and, commending the
                  travellers to their care, left the apartment.</p>
               <p>In a few moments a table was spread with a plain and wholesome repast, to which
                  the two travellers sat down with appetites sharpened by their long journey.</p>
               <p>During the supper, the brothers of the convent, among whom Father Antonio had
                  always been a favorite, crowded around him in a state of eager excitement.</p>
               <p>"You should have been here the last week," said one; "such a turmoil as we have
                  been in!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said another,—"the Pope hath set on the Franciscans, who, you know, are
                  always ready enough to take up with anything against our order, and they have been
                  pursuing our father like so many hounds."</p>
               <p>"There hath been a whirlwind of preaching here and there," said a third,—"in the
                  Duomo, and Santa Croce, and San Lorenzo; and they have battled to and fro, and all
                  the city is full of it."</p>
               <p>"Tell him about yesterday, about the ordeal," shouted an eager voice.</p>
               <p>Two or three voices took up the story at once, and began to tell it,—all the
                  others correcting, contradicting, or adding incidents. From the confused fragments
                  here and there Agostino gathered that there had been on the day before a popular
                  spectacle in the grand piazza, in which, according to an old superstition of the
                  Middle Ages, Frà Girolamo Savonarola and his opponents were expected to prove the
                  truth of their words by passing unhurt through the fire; that two immense piles of
                  combustibles had been constructed with a narrow passage between, and the whole
                  magistracy of the city convened, with a throng of the populace, eager for the
                  excitement of the spectacle; that the day had been spent in discussions, and
                  scruples, and preliminaries; and that, finally, in the afternoon, a violent storm
                  of rain arising had dispersed the multitude and put a stop to the whole
                  exhibition.</p>
               <p>"But the people are not satisfied," said Father Angelo;<pb n="290-291"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000146"/> "and there are enough mischief-makers among them to
                  throw all the blame on our father."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said one, "they say he wanted to burn the Holy Sacrament, because he was
                  going to take it with him into the fire."</p>
               <p>"As if it could burn!" said another voice.</p>
               <p>"It would to all human appearance, I suppose," said a third.</p>
               <p>"Any way," said a fourth, "there is some mischief brewing; for here is our friend
                  Prospero Rondinelli just come in, who says, when he came past the Duomo, he saw
                  people gathering, and heard them threatening us: there were as many as two
                  hundred, he thought."</p>
               <p>"We ought to tell Father Girolamo," exclaimed several voices.</p>
               <p>"Oh, he will not be disturbed!" said Father Angelo. "Since these affairs, he hath
                  been in prayer in the chapter-room before the blessed Angelico's picture of the
                  Cross. When we would talk with him of these things, he waves us away, and says
                  only, 'I am weary; go and tell Jesus.'"</p>
               <p>"He bade me come to him after supper," said Father Antonio. "I will talk with
                  him."</p>
               <p>"Do so,—that is right," said two or three eager voices, as the monk and Agostino,
                  having finished their repast, arose to be conducted to the presence of the
                  father.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE ATTACK ON SAN MARCO.</head>
               <p>THEY found him in a large and dimly lighted apartment, sitting absorbed in pensive
                  contemplation before a picture of the Crucifixion by Frà Angelico, which, whatever
                  might be its <foreign xml:lang="FRA">naïve</foreign> faults of drawing and
                  perspective, had an intense earnestness of feeling, and, though faded and dimmed
                  by the lapse of centuries, still stirs in some faint wise even the practised
                     <foreign xml:lang="ITA">dilettanti</foreign> of our day.</p>
               <p>The face upon the cross, with its majestic patience, seemed to shed a blessing
                  down on the company of saints of all ages who were grouped by their representative
                  men at the foot. Saint Dominic, Saint Ambrose, Saint Augustin, Saint Jerome, Saint
                  Francis, and Saint Benedict were depicted as standing before the Great Sacrifice
                  in company with the Twelve Apostles, the two Maries, and the fainting mother of
                  Jesus,—thus expressing the unity of the Church Universal in that great victory of
                  sorrow and glory. The painting was enclosed above by a semicircular bordering
                  composed of medallion heads of the Prophets, and below was a similar medallion
                  border of the principal saints and worthies of the Dominican order. In our day
                  such pictures are visited by tourists with red guide-books in their hands, who
                  survey them in the intervals of careless conversation; but they were painted by
                  the simple artist on his knees, weeping and praying as he worked, and the sight of
                  them was accepted by like simple-hearted Christians as a perpetual sacrament of
                  the eye, by which they received Christ into their souls.</p>
               <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7945-00000147"/>
               <p>So absorbed was the father in the contemplation of this picture, that he did not
                  hear the approaching footsteps of the knight and monk. When at last they came so
                  near as almost to touch him, he suddenly looked up, and it became apparent that
                  his eyes were full of tears.</p>
               <p>He rose, and, pointing with a mute gesture toward the painting, said,—</p>
               <p>"There is more in that than in all Michel Angelo Buonarotti hath done yet, though
                  he be a God-fearing youth,—more than in all the heathen marbles in Lorenzo's
                  gardens. But sit down with me here. I have to come here often, where I can refresh
                  my courage."</p>
               <p>The monk and knight seated themselves, the latter with his attention riveted on
                  the remarkable man before him. The head and face of Savonarola are familiar to us
                  by many paintings and medallions, which, however, fail to impart what must have
                  been that effect of his personal presence which so drew all hearts to him in his
                  day. The knight saw a man of middle age, of elastic, well-knit figure, and a
                  flexibility and grace of motion which seemed to make every nerve, even to his
                  finger-ends, vital with the expression of his soul. The close-shaven crown and the
                  plain white Dominican robe gave a severe and statuesque simplicity to the lines of
                  his figure. His head and face, like those of most of the men of genius whom modern
                  Italy has produced, were so strongly cast in the antique mould as to leave no
                  doubt of the identity of modern Italian blood with that of the great men of
                  ancient Italy. His low, broad forehead, prominent Roman nose, well-cut, yet fully
                  outlined lips, and strong, finely moulded jaw and chin, all spoke the old Roman
                  vigor and energy, while the flexible delicacy of all the muscles of his face and
                  figure gave an inexpressible fascination to his appearance. Every emotion and
                  changing thought seemed to flutter and tremble over his countenance as the shadow
                  of leaves over sunny water. His eye had a wonderful dilating power, and when he
                  was excited seemed to shower sparks; and his voice possessed a surprising scale of
                  delicate and melodious inflections, which could take him in a moment through the
                  whole range of human feeling, whether playful and tender or denunciatory and
                  terrible. Yet, when in repose among his friends, there was an almost childlike
                  simplicity and artlessness of manner which drew the heart by an irresistible
                  attraction. At this moment it was easy to see by his pale cheek and the furrowed
                  lines of his face that he had been passing through severe struggles; but his mind
                  seemed stayed on some invisible centre, in a solemn and mournful calm.</p>
               <p>"Come, tell me something of the good works of the Lord in our Italy, brother," he
                  said, with a smile which was almost playful in its brightness. "You have been
                  through all the lowly places of the land, carrying our Lord's bread to the poor,
                  and repairing and beautifying shrines and altars by the noble gift that is in
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Yes, father," said the monk; "and I have found that there are many sheep of the
                  Lord that feed quietly among the mountains of Italy, and love nothing so much as
                  to hear of the dear Shepherd who laid down His life for them."</p>
               <p>"Even so, even so," said the Superior, with animation; "and it is the thought of
                  these sweet hearts that comforts me when my soul is among lions. The foundation
                  standeth sure,—the Lord knoweth them that are His."</p>
               <p>"And it is good and encouraging," said Father Antonio,<pb n="294-295"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000148"/> "to see the zeal of the poor, who will give their
                  last penny for the altar of the Lord, and who flock so to hear the word and take
                  the sacraments. I have had precious seasons of preaching and confessing, and have
                  worked in blessedness many days restoring and beautifying the holy pictures and
                  statues whereby these little ones have been comforted. What with the wranglings of
                  princes and the factions and disturbances in our poor Italy, there be many who
                  suffer in want and loss of all things, so that no refuge remains to them but the
                  altars of our Jesus, and none cares for them but He."</p>
               <p>"Brother," said the Superior, "there be thousands of flowers fairer than man ever
                  saw that grow up in waste places and in deep dells and shades of mountains; but
                  God bears each one in His heart, and delighteth Himself in silence with them: and
                  so doth He with these poor, simple, unknown souls. The True Church is not a
                  flaunting queen who goes boldly forth among men displaying her beauties, but a
                  veiled bride, a dove that is in the cleft of the rocks, whose voice is known only
                  to the Beloved. Ah! when shall the great marriage-feast come, when all shall
                  behold her glorified? I had hoped to see the day here in Italy: but now"——</p>
               <p>The father stopped, and seemed to lapse into unconscious musing,—his large eye
                  growing fixed and mysterious in its expression.</p>
               <p>"The brothers have been telling me somewhat of the tribulations you have been
                  through," said Father Antonio, who thought he saw a good opening to introduce the
                  subject nearest his heart.</p>
               <p>"No more of that!—no more!" said the Superior, turning away his head with an
                  expression of pain and weariness; "rather let us look up. What think you, brother,
                  are all <emph>these</emph> doing now?" he said, pointing to the saints in the
                  picture. "They are all alive and well, and see clearly through our darkness."
                  Then, rising up, he added, solemnly, "Whatever man may say or do, it is enough for
                  me to feel that my dearest Lord and His blessed Mother and all the holy
                  archangels, the martyrs and prophets and apostles, are with me. The end is
                  coming."</p>
               <p>"But, dearest father," said Antonio, "think you the Lord will suffer the wicked to
                  prevail?"</p>
               <p>"It may be for a time," said Savonarola. "As for me, I am in His hands only as an
                  instrument. He is master of the forge and handles the hammer, and when He has done
                  using it He casts it from Him. Thus He did with Jeremiah, whom He permitted to be
                  stoned to death when his preaching mission was accomplished; and thus He may do
                  with <emph>this</emph> hammer when He has done using it."</p>
               <p>At this moment a monk rushed into the room with a face expressive of the utmost
                  terror, and called out,—</p>
               <p>"Father, what shall we do? The mob are surrounding the convent! Hark! hear them at
                  the doors!"</p>
               <p>In truth, a wild, confused roar of mingled shrieks, cries, and blows came in
                  through the open door of the apartment; and the pattering sound of approaching
                  footsteps was heard like showering rain-drops along the cloisters.</p>
               <p>"Here come Messer Nicolo de' Lapi, and Francesco Valori!" called out a voice.</p>
               <p>The room was soon filled with a confused crowd, consisting of distinguished
                  Florentine citizens, who had gained admittance through a secret passage, and the
                  excited novices and monks.</p>
               <p>"The streets outside the convent are packed close with<pb n="296-297"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000149"/> men," cried one of the citizens; "they have
                  stationed guards everywhere to cut off our friends who might come to help us."</p>
               <p>"I saw them seize a young man who was quietly walking, singing psalms, and slay
                  him on the steps of the Church of the Innocents," said another; "they cried and
                  hooted, 'No more psalm-singing!'"</p>
               <p>"And there's Arnolfo Battista," said a third;—"he went out to try to speak to
                  them, and they have killed him,—cut him down with their sabres."</p>
               <p>"Hurry! hurry! barricade the door! arm yourselves!" was the cry from other
                  voices.</p>
               <p>"Shall we fight, father? shall we defend ourselves?" cried others, as the monks
                  pressed around their Superior.</p>
               <p>When the crowd first burst into the room, the face of the Superior flushed, and
                  there was a slight movement of surprise; then he seemed to recollect himself, and
                  murmuring, "I expected this, but not so soon," appeared lost in mental prayer. To
                  the agitated inquiries of his flock, he answered,—"No, brothers; the weapons of
                  monks must be spiritual, not carnal." Then lifting on high a crucifix, he
                  said,—"Come with me, and let us walk in solemn procession to the altar, singing
                  the praises of our God."</p>
               <p>The monks, with the instinctive habit of obedience, fell into procession behind
                  their leader, whose voice, clear and strong, was heard raising the Psalm,
                     "<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Quare fremunt gentes</foreign>":—</p>
               <p>"Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</p>
               <p>"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together,
                  against the Lord, and against his Anointed, saying,—</p>
               <p>"'Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.'</p>
               <p>"He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in
                  derision."</p>
               <p>As one voice after another took up the chant, the solemn enthusiasm rose and
                  deepened, and all present, whether ecclesiastics or laymen, fell into the
                  procession and joined in the anthem. Amid the wild uproar, the din and clatter of
                  axes, the thunders of heavy battering-implements on the stone walls and portals,
                  came this long-drawn solemn wave of sound, rising and falling,—now drowned in the
                  savage clamors of the mob, and now bursting out clear and full like the voices of
                  God's chosen amid the confusion and struggles of all the generations of this
                  mortal life.</p>
               <p>White-robed and grand the procession moved on, while the pictured saints and
                  angels on the walls seemed to smile calmly down upon them from a golden twilight.
                  They passed thus into the sacristy, where with all solemnity and composure they
                  arrayed their Father and Superior for the last time in his sacramental robes, and
                  then, still chanting, followed him to the high altar, where all bowed in prayer.
                  And still, whenever there was a pause in the stormy uproar and fiendish clamor,
                  might be heard the clear, plaintive uprising of that strange singing,—"O Lord,
                  save thy people, and bless thine heritage!"</p>
               <p>It needs not to tell in detail what history has told of that tragic night: how the
                  doors at last were forced, and the mob rushed in; how citizens and friends, and
                  many of the monks themselves, their instinct of combativeness overcoming their
                  spiritual beliefs, fought valiantly, and used torches and crucifixes for purposes
                  little contemplated when they were made.</p>
               <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7945-00000150"/>
               <p>Fiercest among the combatants was Agostino, who three times drove back the crowd
                  as they were approaching the choir, where Savonarola and his immediate friends
                  were still praying. Father Antonio, too, seized a sword from the hand of a fallen
                  man and laid about him with an impetuosity which would be inexplicable to any who
                  do not know what force there is in gentle natures when the objects of their
                  affections are assailed. The artist monk fought for his master with the blind
                  desperation with which a woman fights over the cradle of her child.</p>
               <p>All in vain! Past midnight, and the news comes that artillery is planted to blow
                  down the walls of the convent, and the magistracy, who up to this time have lifted
                  not a finger to repress the tumult, send word to Savonarola to surrender himself
                  to them, together with the two most active of his companions, Frà Domenico da
                  Pescia and Frà Silvestro Maruffi, as the only means of averting the destruction of
                  the whole order. They offer him assurances of protection and safe return, which he
                  does not in the least believe: nevertheless, he feels that his hour is come, and
                  gives himself up.</p>
               <p>His preparations were all made with a solemn method which showed that he felt he
                  was approaching the last act in the drama of life. He called together his flock,
                  scattered and forlorn, and gave them his last words of fatherly advice,
                  encouragement, and comfort,—ending with the remarkable declaration, "A Christian's
                  life consists in doing good and suffering evil." "I go with joy to this
                  marriage-supper," he said, as he left the church for the last sad preparations. He
                  and his doomed friends then confessed and received the sacrament, and after that
                  he surrendered himself into the hands of the men who he felt in his prophetic soul
                  had come to take him to torture and to death.</p>
               <p>As he gave himself into their hands, he said, "I commend to your care this flock
                  of mine, and these good citizens of Florence who have been with us;" and then once
                  more turning to his brethren, said,—"Doubt not, my brethren. God will not fail to
                  perfect His work. Whether I live or die, He will aid and console you."</p>
               <p>At this moment there was a struggle with the attendants in the outer circle of the
                  crowd, and the voice of Father Antonio was heard crying out earnestly,—"Do not
                  hold me! I will go with him! I must go with him!"—"Son," said Savonarola, "I
                  charge you on your obedience not to come. It is I and Frà Domenico who are to die
                  for the love of Christ." And thus, at the ninth hour of the night, he passed the
                  threshold of San Marco.</p>
               <p>As he was leaving, a plaintive voice of distress was heard from a young novice who
                  had been peculiarly dear to him, who stretched his hands after him,
                  crying,—"Father! father! why do you leave us desolate?" Whereupon he turned back a
                  moment, and said,—"God will be your help. If we do not see each other again in
                  this world, we surely shall in heaven."</p>
               <p>When the party had gone forth, the monks and citizens stood looking into each
                  other's faces, listening with dismay to the howl of wild ferocity that was rising
                  around the departing prisoner.</p>
               <p>"What shall we do?" was the outcry from many voices.</p>
               <p>"I know what I shall do," said Agostino. "If any man here will find me a fleet
                  horse, I will start for Milan this very hour; for my uncle is now there on a
                  visit, and he is a counsellor of weight with the King of France: we must get the
                  King to interfere."</p>
               <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7945-00000151"/>
               <p>"Good! good! good!" rose from a hundred voices.</p>
               <p>"I will go with you," said Father Antonio. "I shall have no rest till I do
                  something."</p>
               <p>"And I," quoth Jacopo Niccolini, "will saddle for you, without delay, two horses
                  of part Arabian blood, swift of foot, and easy, and which will travel day and
                  night without sinking."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE CATHEDRAL.</head>
               <p>THE rays of the setting sun were imparting even more than their wonted
                  cheerfulness to the airy and bustling streets of Milan. There was the usual rush
                  and roar of busy life which mark the great city, and the display of gay costumes
                  and brilliant trappings proper to a ducal capital which at that time gave the law
                  to Europe in all matters of taste and elegance, even as Paris does now. It was, in
                  fact, from the reputation of this city in matters of external show that our
                  English term Milliner was probably derived; and one might well have believed this,
                  who saw the sweep of the ducal cortege at this moment returning in pomp from the
                  afternoon airing. Such glittering of gold-embroidered mantles, such bewildering
                  confusion of colors, such flashing of jewelry from cap and dagger-hilt and
                  finger-ring, and even from bridle and stirrup, testified that the male sex at this
                  period in Italy were no whit behind the daughters of Eve in that passion for
                  personal adornment which our age is wont to consider exclusively feminine. Indeed,
                  all that was visible to the vulgar eye of this pageant was wholly masculine;
                  though no one doubted that behind the gold-embroidered curtains of the litters
                  which contained the female notabilities of the court still more dazzling wonders
                  might be concealed. Occasionally a white jewelled hand would draw aside one of
                  these screens, and a pair of eyes brighter than any gems<pb n="302-303"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000152"/> would peer forth; and then there would be tokens of
                  a visible commotion among the plumed and gemmed cavaliers around, and one young
                  head would nod to another with jests and quips, and there would be bowing and
                  curveting and all the antics and caracolings supposable among gay young people on
                  whom the sun shone brightly, and who felt the world going well around them, and
                  deemed themselves the observed of all observers.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the mute, subservient common people looked on all this as a part of
                  their daily amusement. Meek dwellers in those dank, noisome caverns, without any
                  opening but a street-door, which are called dwelling-places in Italy, they lived
                  in uninquiring good-nature, contentedly bringing up children on coarse bread,
                  dirty cabbage-stumps, and other garbage, while all that they could earn was sucked
                  upward by capillary attraction to nourish the extravagance of those upper classes
                  on which they stared with such blind and ignorant admiration.</p>
               <p>This was the lot they believed themselves born for, and which every exhortation of
                  their priests taught them to regard as the appointed ordinance of God. The women,
                  to be sure, as women always will be, were true to the instinct of their sex, and
                  crawled out of the damp and vile-smelling recesses of their homes with solid gold
                  ear-rings shaking in their ears, and their blue-black lustrous hair ornamented
                  with a glittering circle of steel pins or other quaint coiffure. There was sense
                  in all this: for had not even Dukes of Milan been found so condescending and
                  affable as to admire the charms of the fair in the lower orders, whence had come
                  sons and daughters who took rank among princes and princesses? What father, or
                  what husband, could be insensible to prospects of such honor? What priest would
                  not readily absolve such sin? Therefore one might have observed more than one
                  comely dark-eyed woman, brilliant as some tropical bird in the colors of her
                  peasant dress, who cast coquettish glances toward high places, not unacknowledged
                  by patronizing nods in return, while mothers and fathers looked on in triumph.
                  These were the days for the upper classes: the Church bore them all in her bosom
                  as a tender nursing-mother, and provided for all their little peccadilloes with
                  even grandmotherly indulgence, and in return the world was immensely deferential
                  towards the Church; and it was only now and then some rugged John Baptist, in
                  raiment of camel's hair, like Savonarola, who dared to speak an indecorous word of
                  God's truth in the ear of power, and Herod and Herodias had ever at hand the good
                  old recipe for quieting such disturbances. John Baptist was beheaded in prison,
                  and then all the world and all the Scribes and Pharisees applauded; and only a few
                  poor disciples were found to take up the body and go and tell Jesus.</p>
               <p>The whole piazza around the great Cathedral is at this moment full of the dashing
                  cavalcade of the ducal court, looking as brilliant in the evening light as a field
                  of poppy, corn-flower, and scarlet clover at Sorrento; and there, amid the flutter
                  and rush, the amours and intrigues, the court scandal, the laughing, the gibing,
                  the glitter, and dazzle, stands that wonderful Cathedral, that silent witness,
                  that strange, pure, immaculate mountain of airy, unearthly loveliness,—the most
                  striking emblem of God's mingled vastness and sweetness that ever it was given to
                  human heart to devise or hands to execute. If there be among the many mansions of
                  our Father above, among the houses not made with hands, aught purer and fairer, it
                  must be the work of those grand spirits who inspired and presided over the
                     erection<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7945-00000153"/> tion of this celestial
                  miracle of beauty. In the great, vain, wicked city, all alive with the lust of the
                  flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, it seemed to stand as much
                  apart and alone as if it were in the solemn desolation of the Campagna, or in one
                  of the wide deserts of Africa,—so little part or lot did it appear to have in
                  anything earthly, so little to belong to the struggling, bustling crowd who
                  beneath its white dazzling pinnacles seemed dwarfed into crawling insects. They
                  who could look up from the dizzy, frivolous life below saw far, far above them, in
                  the blue Italian air, thousands of glorified saints standing on a thousand airy
                  points of brilliant whiteness, ever solemnly adoring. The marble which below was
                  somewhat touched and soiled with the dust of the street seemed gradually to refine
                  and brighten as it rose into the pure regions of the air, till at last in those
                  thousand distant pinnacles it had the ethereal translucence of wintry frost-work,
                  and now began to glow with the violet and rose hues of evening, in solemn
                  splendor.</p>
               <p>The ducal cortege sweeps by; but we have mounted the dizzy, dark staircase that
                  leads to the roof, where, amid the bustling life of the city, there is a promenade
                  of still and wondrous solitude. One seems to have ascended in those few moments
                  far beyond the tumult and dust of earthly things, to the silence, the clearness,
                  the tranquillity of ethereal regions. The noise of the rushing tides of life below
                  rises only in a soft and distant murmur; while around, in the wide, clear
                  distance, is spread a prospect which has not on earth its like or its equal. The
                  beautiful plains of Lombardy lie beneath like a map, and the northern horizon-line
                  is glittering with the entire sweep of the Alps, like a solemn senate of
                  archangels with diamond mond mail and glittering crowns. Mont Blanc, Monte Rosa
                  with its countenance of light, the Jungfrau and all the weird brothers of the
                  Oberland, rise one after another to the delighted gaze, and the range of the Tyrol
                  melts far off into the blue of the sky. On another side, the Apennines, with their
                  picturesque outlines and cloud-spotted sides, complete the enclosure. All around,
                  wherever the eye turns, is the unbroken phalanx of mountains; and this temple,
                  with its thousand saintly statues standing in attitudes of ecstasy and prayer,
                  seems like a worthy altar and shrine for the beautiful plain which the mountains
                  enclose: it seems to give all Northern Italy to God.</p>
               <p>The effect of the statues in this high, pure air, in this solemn, glorious
                  scenery, is peculiar. They seem a meet companionship for these exalted regions.
                  They seem to stand exultant on their spires, poised lightly as ethereal creatures,
                  the fit inhabitants of the pure blue sky. One feels that they have done with
                  earth; one can fancy them a band of white-robed kings and priests forever
                  ministering in that great temple of which the Alps and the Apennines are the walls
                  and the Cathedral the heart and centre. Never were Art and Nature so majestically
                  married by Religion in so worthy a temple.</p>
               <p>One form could be discerned standing in rapt attention, gazing from a platform on
                  the roof upon the far-distant scene. He was enveloped in the white coarse woollen
                  gown of the Dominican monks, and seemed wholly absorbed in meditating on the scene
                  before him, which appeared to move him deeply; for, raising his hands, he repeated
                  aloud from the Latin Vulgate the words of an Apostle:—</p>
               <p>"Accessistis ad Sion montem et civitatem Dei viventis, Jerusalem cælestem, et
                  multorum millium angelorum frequentiam<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7945-00000154"/>

                     heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general
                     assembly and church of the first-born, which are written in heaven."</p>
               </note>
               <p>At this moment the evening worship commenced within the Cathedral, and the whole
                  building seemed to vibrate with the rising swell of the great organ, while the
                  grave, long-drawn tones of the Ambrosian Liturgy rose surging in waves and dying
                  away in distant murmurs, like the rolling of the tide on some ocean-shore. The
                  monk turned and drew near to the central part of the roof to listen, and as he
                  turned he disclosed the well-known features of Father Antonio.</p>
               <p>Haggard, weary, and travel-worn, his first impulse, on entering the city, was to
                  fly to this holy solitude, as the wandering sparrow of sacred song sought her nest
                  amid the altars of God's temple. Artist no less than monk, he found in this
                  wondrous shrine of beauty a repose both for his artistic and his religious nature;
                  and while waiting for Agostino Sarelli to find his uncle's residence, he had
                  determined to pass the interval in this holy solitude. Many hours had be paced
                  alone up and down the long promenades of white marble which run everywhere between
                  forests of dazzling pinnacles and flying buttresses of airy lightness. Now he
                  rested in fixed attention against the wall above the choir, which he could feel
                  pulsating with throbs of sacred sound, as if a great warm heart were beating
                  within the fair marble miracle, warming it into mysterious life and sympathy.</p>
               <p>"I would now that boy were here to worship with me," he said. "No wonder the
                  child's faith fainteth: it takes such monuments as these of the Church's former
                  days to strengthen one's hopes. Ah, woe unto those by whom such offence
                  cometh!"</p>
               <p>At this moment the form of Agostino was seen ascending the marble staircase.</p>
               <p>The eye of the monk brightened as he came towards him. He put out one hand eagerly
                  to take his, and raised the other with a gesture of silence.</p>
               <p>"Look," he said, "and listen! Is it not the sound of many waters and mighty
                  thunderings?"</p>
               <p>Agostino stood subdued for the moment by the magnificent sights and sounds; for,
                  as the sun went down, the distant mountains grew every moment more unearthly in
                  their brilliancy,—and as they lay in a long line, jewelled brightness mingling
                  with the cloud-wreaths of the far horizon, one might have imagined that he in
                  truth beheld the foundations of that celestial city of jasper, pearl, and
                  translucent gold which the Apostle saw, and that the risings and fallings of
                  choral sound which seemed to thrill and pulsate through the marble battlements
                  were indeed that song like many waters sung by the Church Triumphant above.</p>
               <p>For a few moments the monk and the young man stood in silence, till at length the
                  monk spoke.</p>
               <p>"You have told me, my son, that your heart often troubles you in being more Roman
                  than Christian; that you sometimes doubt whether the Church on earth be other than
                  a fiction or a fable. But look around us. Who are these, this great multitude who
                  praise and pray continually in this temple of the upper air? These are they who
                  have come out of great tribulation, having washed their robes and made them white
                  in the blood of the Lamb. These are not the men that have sacked cities, and made
                  deserts, and written their triumphs in blood and carnage. These be men that have
                  sheltered the poor, and built houses for orphans, and sold themselves into slavery
                  to redeem their brothers in<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7945-00000155"/> Christ.
                  These be pure women who have lodged saints, brought up children, lived holy and
                  prayerful lives. These be martyrs who have laid down their lives for the testimony
                  of Jesus. There were no such churches in old Rome,—no such saints."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Agostino, "one thing is certain. If such be the True Church, the Pope
                  and the Cardinals of our day have no part in it; for they are the men who sack
                  cities and make desolations, who devour widows' houses and for a pretence make
                  long prayers. Let us see one of <emph>them</emph> selling himself into slavery for
                  the love of anybody, while they seek to keep all the world in slavery to
                  themselves!"</p>
               <p>"That is the grievous declension our master weeps over," said the monk. "Ah, if
                  the Bishops of the Church now were like brave old Saint Ambrose, strong alone by
                  faith and prayer, showing no more favor to an unrepentant Emperor than to the
                  meanest slave, then would the Church be a reality and a glory! Such is my master.
                  Never is he afraid of the face of king or lord, when he has God's truth to speak.
                  You should have heard how plainly he dealt with our Lorenzo de' Medici on his
                  death-bed,—how he refused him absolution, unless he would make restitution to the
                  poor and restore the liberties of Florence."</p>
               <p>"I should have thought," said the young man, sarcastically, "that Lorenzo the
                  Magnificent might have got absolution cheaper than that. Where were all the
                  bishops in his dominion, that he must needs send for Jerome Savonarola?"</p>
               <p>"Son, it is ever so," replied the monk. "If there be a man that cares neither for
                  Duke nor Emperor, but for God alone, then Dukes and Emperors would give more for
                  his good word than for a whole dozen of common priests."</p>
               <p>"I suppose it is something like a rare manuscript or a singular gem: these
                     <foreign xml:lang="ITA">virtuosi</foreign> have no rest till they have clutched
                  it. The thing they cannot get is always the thing they want."</p>
               <p>"Lorenzo was always seeking our master," said the monk. "Often would he come
                  walking in our gardens, expecting surely he would hasten down to meet him; and the
                  brothers would run all out of breath to his cell to say, 'Father, Lorenzo is in
                  the garden.' 'He is welcome,' would he answer, with his pleasant smile. 'But,
                  father, will you not descend to meet him?' 'Hath he asked for me?' 'No.' 'Well,
                  then, let us not interrupt his meditations,' he would answer, and remain still at
                  his reading, so jealous was he lest he should seek the favor of princes and forget
                  God, as does all the world in our day."</p>
               <p>"And because he does not seek the favor of the men of this world he will be
                  trampled down and slain. Will the God in whom he trusts defend him?"</p>
               <p>The monk pointed expressively upward to the statues that stood glorified above
                  them, still wearing a rosy radiance, though the shadows of twilight had fallen on
                  all the city below.</p>
               <p>"My son," he said, "the victories of the True Church are not in time, but in
                  eternity. How many around us were conquered on earth that they might triumph in
                  heaven! What saith the Apostle? 'They were tortured, not accepting deliverance,
                  that they might obtain a better resurrection.'"</p>
               <p>"But, alas!" said Agostino, "are we never to see the right triumph here? I fear
                  that this noble name is written in blood, like so many of whom the world is not
                  worthy. Can one do nothing to help it?"</p>
               <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7945-00000156"/>
               <p>"How is that? What have you heard?" said the monk, eagerly. "Have you seen your
                  uncle?"</p>
               <p>"Not yet; he is gone into the country for a day,—so say his servants. I saw, when
                  the Duke's court passed, my cousin, who is in his train, and got a moment's speech
                  with him; and he promised, that, if I would wait for him here, he would come to me
                  as soon as he could be let off from his attendance. When he comes, it were best
                  that we confer alone."</p>
               <p>"I will retire to the southern side," said the monk, "and await the end of your
                  conference;" and with that he crossed the platform on which they were standing,
                  and, going down a flight of white marble steps, was soon lost to view amid the
                  wilderness of frost-like carved work.</p>
               <p>He had scarcely vanished, before footsteps were heard ascending the marble
                  staircase on the other side, and the sound of a voice humming a popular air of the
                  court.</p>
               <p>The stranger was a young man of about five-and-twenty, habited with all that
                  richness and brilliancy of coloring which the fashion of the day permitted to a
                  young exquisite. His mantle of purple velvet falling jauntily off from one
                  shoulder disclosed a doublet of amber satin richly embroidered with gold and
                  seed-pearl. The long white plume which drooped from his cap was held in its place
                  by a large diamond which sparkled like a star in the evening twilight. His finely
                  moulded hands were loaded with rings, and ruffles of the richest Venetian lace
                  encircled his wrists. He had worn over all a dark cloak with a peaked hood, the
                  usual evening disguise in Italy; but as he gained the top-stair of the platform,
                  he threw it carelessly down and gayly offered his hand.</p>
               <p>"Good even to you, cousin mine! So you see I am as true to my appointment as if
                  your name were Leonora or Camilla instead of Agostino. How goes it with you? I
                  wanted to talk with you below, but I saw we must have a place without listeners.
                  Our friends the saints are too high in heavenly things to make mischief by
                  eavesdropping."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Cousin Carlos, for your promptness. And now to the point. Did your
                  father, my uncle, get the letter I wrote him about a month since?"</p>
               <p>"He did; and he bade me treat with you about it. It's an abominable snarl this
                  they have got you into. My father says, your best way is to come straight to him
                  in France, and abide till things take a better turn: he is high in favor with the
                  King and can find you a very pretty place at court, and he takes it upon him in
                  time to reconcile the Pope. Between you and me, the old Pope has no special spite
                  in the world against <emph>you:</emph> he merely wants your lands for his son, and
                  as long as you prowl round and lay claim to them, why, you must stay
                  excommunicated; but just clear the coast and leave them peaceably and he will put
                  you back into the True Church, and my father will charge himself with your
                  success. Popes don't last forever, or there may come another falling out with the
                  King of France, and either way there will be a chance of your being one day put
                  back into your rights; meanwhile, a young fellow might do worse than have a good
                  place in our court."</p>
               <p>During this long monologue, which the young speaker uttered with all the flippant
                  self-sufficiency of worldly people with whom the world is going well, the face of
                  the young nobleman who listened presented a picture of many strong contending
                  emotions.</p>
               <p>"You speak," he said, "as if man had nothing to do in this world but seek his own
                  ease and pleasure. What lies<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7945-00000157"/> nearest my
                  heart is not that I am plundered of my estates, and my house uprooted, but it is
                  that my beautiful Rome, the city of my fathers, is a prisoner under the heel of
                  the tyrant. It is that the glorious religion of Christ, the holy faith in which my
                  mother died, the faith made venerable by all these saints around us, is made the
                  tool and instrument of such vileness and cruelty that one is tempted to doubt
                  whether it were not better to have been born of heathen in the good old times of
                  the Roman Republic,—God forgive me for saying so! Does the Most Christian King of
                  France know that the man who pretends to rule in the name of Christ is not a
                  believer in the Christian religion,—that he does not believe even in a God,—that
                  he obtained the holy seat by simony,—that he uses all its power to enrich a brood
                  of children whose lives are so indecent that it is a shame to modest lips even to
                     <emph>say</emph> what they do?"</p>
               <p>"Why, of course," said the other, "the King of France is pretty well informed
                  about all these things. You know old King Charles, when he marched through Italy,
                  had more than half a mind, they say, to pull the old Pope out of his place; and he
                  might have done it easily. My father was in his train at that time, and he says
                  the Pope was frightened enough. Somehow they made it all up among them, and
                  settled about their territories, which is the main thing, after all; and now our
                  new King, I fancy, does not like to meddle with him: between you and me, he has
                  his eye in another direction here. This gay city would suit him admirably, and he
                  fancies he can govern it as well as it is governed now. My father does not visit
                  here with his eyes shut, <emph>I</emph> can tell you. But as to the Pope——Well,
                  you see such things are delicate to handle. After all, my dear Agostino, we are
                  not priests,—our business is with this world; and, no matter how they came by
                  them, these fellows have the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and one cannot afford
                  to quarrel with them,—we must have the ordinances, you know, or what becomes of
                  our souls? Do you suppose, now, that I should live as gay and easy a life as I do,
                  if I thought there were any doubt of my salvation? It's a mercy to us sinners that
                  the ordinances are not vitiated by the sins of the priests; it would go hard with
                  us, if they were: as it is, if they will live scandalous lives, it is their
                  affair, not ours."</p>
               <p>"And is it nothing," replied the other, "to a true man who has taken the holy vows
                  of knighthood on him, whether his Lord's religion be defamed and dishonored and
                  made a scandal and a scoffing? Did not all Europe go out to save Christ's holy
                  sepulchre from being dishonored by the feet of the Infidel? and shall we let
                  infidels have the very house of the Lord, and reign supreme in His holy
                  dwelling-place? There has risen a holy prophet in Italy, the greatest since the
                  time of Saint Francis, and his preaching hath stirred all hearts to live more
                  conformably with our holy faith; and now for his pure life and good works he is
                  under excommunication of the Pope, and they have seized and imprisoned him, and
                  threaten his life."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you mean Savonarola," said the other. "Yes, we have heard of him,—a most
                  imprudent, impracticable fellow, who will not take advice nor be guided. My
                  father, I believe, thought well of him once, and deemed that in the distracted
                  state of Italy he might prove serviceable in forwarding some of his plans: but he
                  is wholly wrapt up in his own notions; he heeds no will but his own."</p>
               <p>"Have you heard anything," said Agostino, "of a letter which he wrote to the King
                  of France lately, stirring him up<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7945-00000158"/> to
                  call a General Council of the Christian Church to consider what is to be done
                  about the scandals at Rome?"</p>
               <p>"Then he has written one, has he?" replied the young man; "then the story that I
                  have heard whispered about here must be true. A man who certainly is in a
                  condition to know told me day before yesterday that the Duke had arrested a
                  courier with some such letter, and sent it on to the Pope: it is likely, for the
                  Duke hates Savonarola. If that be true, it will go hard with him yet; for the Pope
                  has a long arm for an enemy."</p>
               <p>"And so," said Agostino, with an expression of deep concern, "that letter, from
                  which the good man hoped so much, and which was so powerful, will only go to
                  increase his danger!"</p>
               <p>"The more fool he!—he might have known that it was of no use. Who was going to
                  take his part against the Pope?"</p>
               <p>"The city of Florence has stood by him until lately," said Agostino,—"and would
                  again, with a little help."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! never think it, my dear Agostino! Depend upon it, it will end as such
                  things always do, and the man is only a madman that undertakes it. Hark ye,
                  cousin, what have <emph>you</emph> to do with this man? Why do you attach yourself
                  to the side that is <emph>sure</emph> to lose? I cannot conceive what you would be
                  at. This is no way to mend your fortunes. Come to-night to my father's palace: the
                  Duke has appointed us princely lodgings, and treats us with great hospitality, and
                  my father has plans for your advantage. Between us, there is a fair young ward of
                  his, of large estates and noble blood, whom he designs for you. So you see, if you
                  turn your attention in this channel, there may come a reinforcement of the family
                  property, which will enable you to hold out until the Pope dies, or some prince or
                  other gets into a quarrel with him, which is always happening, and then a move may
                  be made for you. My father, I'll promise you, is shrewd enough, and always keeps
                  his eye open to see where there is a joint in the harness, and have a trusty
                  dagger-blade all whetted to stick under. Of course, he means to see you righted;
                  he has the family interest at heart, and feels as indignant as you could at the
                  rascality which has been perpetrated; but I am quite sure he will tell you that
                  the way is not to come out openly against the Pope and join this fanatical
                  party."</p>
               <p>Agostino stood silent, with the melancholy air of a man who has much to say, and
                  is deeply moved by considerations which he perceives it would be utterly idle and
                  useless to attempt to explain. If the easy theology of his friend were indeed
                  true,—if the treasures of the heavenly kingdom, glory, honor, and immortality,
                  could indeed be placed in unholy hands, to be bought and sold and traded in,—if
                  holiness of heart and life, and all those nobler modes of living and being which
                  were witnessed in the histories of the thousand saints around him, were indeed but
                  a secondary thing in the strife for worldly place and territory,—what, then,
                  remained for the man of ideas, of aspirations? In such a state of society, his
                  track must be like that of the dove in sacred history, who found no rest for the
                  sole of her foot.</p>
               <p>Agostino folded his arms and sighed deeply, and then made answer mechanically, as
                  one whose thoughts are afar off.</p>
               <p>"Present my duty," he said, "to my uncle, your father and say to him that I will
                  wait on him to-night."</p>
               <p>"Even so," said the young man, picking up his cloak and<pb n="316-317"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000159"/> folding it about him. "And now, you know, I must
                  go. Don't be discouraged; keep up a good heart; you shall see what it is to have
                  powerful friends to stand by you; all will be right yet. Come, will you go with me
                  now?"</p>
               <p>"Thank you," said Agostino, "I think I would be alone a little while. My head is
                  confused, and I would fain think over matters a little quietly."</p>
               <p>"Well, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au revoir</foreign>, then. I must leave you to the
                  company of the saints. But be sure and come early."</p>
               <p>So saying, he threw his cloak over his shoulder and sauntered carelessly down the
                  marble steps, humming again the gay air with which he had ascended.</p>
               <p>Left alone, Agostino once more cast a glance on the strangely solemn and
                  impressive scene around him. He was standing on a platform of the central tower
                  which over-looked the whole building. The round, full moon had now risen in the
                  horizon, displacing by her solemn brightness the glow of twilight; and her beams
                  were reflected by the delicate frost-work of the myriad pinnacles which rose in a
                  bewildering maze at his feet. It might seem to be some strange enchanted garden of
                  fairy-land, where a luxuriant and freakish growth of Nature had been suddenly
                  arrested and frozen into eternal stillness. Around in the shadows at the foot of
                  the Cathedral the lights of the great gay city twinkled and danced and veered and
                  fluttered like fireflies in the damp, dewy shadows of some moist meadow in summer.
                  The sound of clattering hoofs and rumbling wheels, of tinkling guitars and gay
                  roundelays, rose out of that obscure distance, seeming far off and plaintive like
                  the dream of a life that is past. The great church seemed a vast world; the long
                  aisles of statued pinnacles with their pure floorings of white marble appeared as
                  if they might be the corridors of heaven; and it seemed as if the crowned and
                  sceptred saints in their white marriage-garments might come down and walk there,
                  without ever a spot of earth on their unsullied whiteness.</p>
               <p>In a few moments Father Antonio had glided back to the side of the young man, whom
                  he found so lost in reverie that not till he laid his hand upon his arm did he
                  awaken from his meditations.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" he said, with a start, "my father, is it you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my son. What of your conference? Have you learned anything?"</p>
               <p>"Father, I have learned far more than I wished to know."</p>
               <p>"What is it, my son? Speak it at once."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, I fear that the letter of our holy father to the King of France has
                  been intercepted here in Milan, and sent to the Pope."</p>
               <p>"What makes you think so?" said the monk, with an eagerness that showed how much
                  he felt the intelligence.</p>
               <p>"My cousin tells me that a person of consideration in the Duke's household, who is
                  supposed to be in a position to know, told him that it was so."</p>
               <p>Agostino felt the light grasp which the monk had laid upon his arm gradually
                  closing with a convulsive pressure, and that he was trembling with intense
                  feeling.</p>
               <p>"Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight!" he said, after a few
                  moments of silence.</p>
               <p>"It is discouraging," said Agostino, "to see how little these princes care for the
                  true interests of religion and the service of God,—how little real fealty there is
                  to our Lord Jesus."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the monk, "all seek their own, and not the<pb n="318-319"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000160"/> things that are Christ's. It is well written, 'Put
                  not your trust in princes.'"</p>
               <p>"And what prospect, what hope do you see for him?" said Agostino. "Will Florence
                  stand firm?"</p>
               <p>"I could have thought so once," said the monk,—"in those days when I have seen
                  counsellors and nobles and women of the highest degree all humbly craving to hear
                  the word of God from his lips, and seeming to seek nothing so much as to purify
                  their houses, their hands, and their hearts, that they might be worthy citizens of
                  that commonwealth which has chosen the Lord Jesus for its gonfalonier. I have seen
                  the very children thronging to kiss the hem of his robe, as he walked through the
                  streets; but, oh, my friend, did not Jerusalem bring palms and spread its garments
                  in the way of Christ only four days before he was crucified?"</p>
               <p>The monk's voice here faltered. He turned away and seemed to wrestle with a
                  tempest of suppressed sobbing. A moment more, he looked heavenward and pointed up
                  with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Son," he said, "you ask <emph>what hope there is</emph>. I answer, There is hope
                  of such crowns as these wear who came out of great tribulation and now reign with
                  Christ in glory."</p>

               <head type="sub">THE PILGRIMAGE.</head>
               <p>THE morning sun rose clear and lovely on the old red rocks of Sorrento, and danced
                  in a thousand golden scales and ripples on the wide Mediterranean. The shadows of
                  the gorge were pierced by long golden shafts of light, here falling on some moist
                  bed of crimson cyclamen, there shining through a waving tuft of gladiolus, or
                  making the abundant yellow fringes of the broom more vivid in their brightness.
                  The velvet-mossy old bridge, in the far shadows at the bottom, was lit up by a
                  chance beam, and seemed as if it might be something belonging to fairy-land.</p>
               <p>There had been a bustle and stir betimes in the little dove-cot, for to-morrow the
                  inmates were to leave it for a long, adventurous journey.</p>
               <p>To old Elsie, the journey back to Rome, the city of her former days of prosperity,
                  the place which had witnessed her ambitious hopes, her disgrace and downfall, was
                  full of painful ideas. There arose to her memory, like a picture, those princely
                  halls, with their slippery, cold mosaic floors, their long galleries of statues
                  and paintings, their enchanting gardens, musical with the voice of mossy
                  fountains, fragrant with the breath of roses and jasmines, where the mother of
                  Agnes had spent the hours of her youth and beauty. She seemed to see her flitting
                  hither and thither down the stately ilex-avenues, like some gay singing-bird, to
                  whom were given gilded cages and a constant round of caresses<pb n="320-321"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000161"/> and sweets, or like the flowers in the parterres,
                  which lived and died only as the graceful accessories of the grandeur of an old
                  princely family.</p>
               <p>She compared, mentally, the shaded and secluded life which Agnes had led with the
                  specious and fatal brilliancy which had been the lot of her mother,—her simple
                  peasant garb with those remembered visions of jewelry and silk and embroideries
                  with which the partial patronage of the Duchess or the ephemeral passion of her
                  son had decked out the poor Isella; and then came swelling at her heart a
                  tumultuous thought, one which she had repressed and kept down for years with all
                  the force of pride and hatred. Agnes, peasant-girl though she seemed, had yet the
                  blood of that proud old family in her veins; the marriage had been a true one; she
                  herself had witnessed it.</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed," she said to herself, "were justice done, she would now be a
                  princess,—a fit mate for the nobles of the land; and here I ask no more than to
                  mate her to an honest smith,—I that have seen a prince kneel to kiss her mother's
                  hand,—yes, he did,—entreat her on his knees to be his wife,—I saw it. But then,
                  what came of it? Was there ever one of these nobles that kept oath or promise to
                  us of the people, or that cared for us longer than the few moments we could serve
                  his pleasure? Old Elsie, you have done wisely! keep your dove out of the eagle's
                  nest: it is foul with the blood of poor innocents whom he has torn to pieces in
                  his cruel pride!"</p>
               <p>These thoughts swelled in silence in the mind of Elsie, while she was busy sorting
                  and arranging her household stores, and making those thousand-and-one preparations
                  known to every householder, whether of much or little, who meditates a long
                  journey.</p>
               <p>To Agnes she seemed more than ever severe and hard; yet probably there never was a
                  time when every pulse of her heart was beating more warmly for the child, and
                  every thought of the future was more entirely regulated with reference to her
                  welfare. It is no sinecure to have the entire devotion of a strong, enterprising,
                  self-willed friend, as Agnes had all her life found. One cannot gather grapes of
                  thorns or figs of thistles, and the affection of thorny and thistly natures has
                  often as sharp an acid and as long prickers as wild gooseberries,—yet it is their
                  best, and must be so accepted.</p>
               <p>Agnes tried several times to offer her help to her grandmother, but was refused so
                  roughly that she dared not offer again, and therefore went to her favorite station
                  by the parapet in the garden, whence she could look up and down the gorge, and
                  through the arches of the old mossy Roman bridge that spanned it far down by the
                  city-wall. All these things had become dear to her by years of familiar silent
                  converse. The little garden, with its old sculptured basin, and the ever-lulling
                  dash of falling water,—the tremulous draperies of maiden's-hair, always beaded
                  with shining drops,—the old shrine, with its picture, its lamp, and
                  flower-vase,—the tall, dusky orange-trees, so full of blossoms and fruit, so
                  smooth and shining in their healthy bark,—all seemed to her as so many dear old
                  friends whom she was about to leave, perhaps forever.</p>
               <p>What this pilgrimage would be like, she scarcely knew: days and weeks of
                  wandering,—over mountain-passes,—in deep, solitary valleys,—as years ago, when her
                  grandmother brought her, a little child, from Rome.</p>
               <p>In the last few weeks, Agnes seemed to herself to have become wholly another
                  being. Silently, insensibly, her feet<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7945-00000162"/>
                  had crossed the enchanted river that divides childhood from womanhood, and all the
                  sweet ignorant joys of that first early paradise lay behind her. Up to this time
                  her life had seemed to her a charming dream, full of blessed visions and images:
                  legends of saints, and hymns, and prayers had blended with flower-gatherings in
                  the gorge, and light daily toils.</p>
               <p>Now, a new, strange life had been born within her,—a life full of passions,
                  contradictions, and conflicts. A love had sprung up in her heart, strange and
                  wonderful, for one who till within these few weeks had been entirely unknown to
                  her, who had never toiled for, or housed, or clothed, or cared for her as her
                  grandmother had, and yet whom a few short interviews, a few looks, a few words,
                  had made to seem nearer and dearer than the old, tried friends of her childhood.
                  In vain she confessed it as a sin,—in vain she strove against it; it came back to
                  her in every hymn, in every prayer. Then she would press the sharp cross to her
                  breast, till a thousand stings of pain would send the blood in momentary rushes to
                  her pale cheek, and cause her delicate lips to contract with an expression of
                  stern endurance, and pray that by any penance and anguish she might secure his
                  salvation.</p>
               <p>To save one such glorious soul, she said to herself, was work enough for one
                  little life. She was willing to spend it all in endurance, unseen by him, unknown
                  to him, so that at last he should be received into that Paradise which her ardent
                  imagination conceived so vividly. Surely, there she should meet him, radiant as
                  the angel of her dream; and then she would tell him that it was all for his sake
                  that she had refused to listen to him here. And these sinful longings to see him
                  once more, these involuntary reachings of her soul after an earthly companionship,
                  she should find strength to overcome in this pilgrimage. She should go to
                  Rome,—the very city where the blessed Paul poured out his blood for the Lord
                  Jesus,—where Peter fed the flock, till his time, too, came to follow his Lord in
                  the way of the cross. She should even come near to her blessed Redeemer; she
                  should go up, on her knees, those very steps to Pilate's hall where He stood
                  bleeding, crowned with thorns,—His blood, perhaps, dropping on the very stones.
                  Ah, could any mortal love distract her there? Should she not there find her soul
                  made free of every earthly thrall to love her Lord alone,—as she had loved Him in
                  the artless and ignorant days of her childhood,—but better, a thousand times?</p>
               <p>"Good-morning to you, pretty dove!" said a voice from without the garden-wall; and
                  Agnes, roused from her revery, saw old Jocunda.</p>
               <p>"I came down to help you off," she said, as she came into the little garden. "Why,
                  my dear little saint! you are looking white as a sheet, and with those tears!
                  What's it all for, baby?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Jocunda! grandmamma is angry with me all the time now. I wish I could go once
                  more to the convent and see my dear Mother Theresa. She is angry, if I but name
                  it; and yet she will not let me do anything here to help her, and so I don't know
                     <emph>what</emph> to do."</p>
               <p>"Well, at any rate, don't cry, pretty one! Your grandmamma is worked with hard
                  thoughts. We old folks are twisted and crabbed and full of knots with
                  disappointment and trouble, like the mulberry-trees that they keep for vines to
                  run on. But I'll speak to her; I know her ways; she shall let you go; I'll bring
                  her round."</p>
               <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7945-00000163"/>
               <p>"So-ho, sister!" said the old soul, hobbling to the door, and looking in at Elsie,
                  who was sitting flat on the stone floor of her cottage, sorting a quantity of flax
                  that lay around her. The severe Roman profile was thrown out by the deep shadows
                  of the interior,—and the piercing black eyes, the silver-white hair, and the
                  strong, compressed lines of the mouth, as she worked, and struggled with the
                  ghosts of her former life, made her look like no unapt personification of one of
                  the Fates reviewing her flax before she commenced the spinning of some new web of
                  destiny.</p>
               <p>"Good-morning to you, sister!" said Jocunda. "I heard you were off to-morrow, and
                  I came to see what I could do to help you."</p>
               <p>"There's nothing to be done for me, but to kill me," said Elsie. "I am weary of
                  living."</p>
               <p>"Oh, never say that! Shake the dice again, my old man used to say,—God rest his
                  soul! Please Saint Agnes, you'll have a brave pilgrimage."</p>
               <p>"Saint Agnes be hanged!" said Elsie, gruffly. "I'm out with her. It was she put
                  all these notions into my girl's head. Because she did n't get married herself,
                  she don't want any one else to. She has no consideration. I've done with her: I
                  told her so this morning. The candles I've burned and the prayers I've gone
                  through with, that she might prosper me in this one thing! and it's all gone
                  against me. She's a baggage, and shall never see another penny of mine,—that's
                  flat!"</p>
               <p>Such vituperation of saints and sacred images may be heard to this day in Italy,
                  and is a common feature of idol-worship in all lands; for, however the invocation
                  of the saints could be vitalized in the hearts of the few spiritual, there is no
                  doubt that in the mass of the common people it had all the well-defined symptoms
                  of the grossest idolatry, among which fits of passionate irreverence are one. The
                  feeling, which tempts the enlightened Christian in sore disappointment and
                  vexation to rise in rebellion against a wise Providence, in the childish twilight
                  of uncultured natures finds its full expression unawed by reverence or fear.</p>
               <p>"Oh, hush, now!" said Jocunda. "What is the use of making her angry just as you
                  are going to Rome, where she has the most power? All sorts of ill-luck will befall
                  you. Make up with her before you start, or you may get the fever in the marshes
                  and die, and then who will take care of poor Agnes?"</p>
               <p>"Let Saint Agnes look after her; the girl loves her better than she does me or
                  anybody else," said Elsie. "If she cared anything about me, she'd marry and settle
                  down, as I want her to."</p>
               <p>"Oh, there you are wrong," said Jocunda. "Marrying is like your dinner: one is not
                  always in stomach for it, and one's meat is another's poison. Now who knows but
                  this pilgrimage may be the very thing to bring the girl round? I've seen people
                  cured of too much religion by going to Rome. You know things a'n't there as our
                  little saint fancies. Why, between you and me, the priests themselves have their
                  jokes on those who come so far to so little purpose. More shame for 'em, say I,
                  too; but we common people must n't look into such things too closely. Now take it
                  cheerfully, and you'll see the girl will come back tired of tramping and able to
                  settle down in a good home with a likely husband. I have a brother in Naples who
                  is turning a pretty penny in the fisheries; I will give you directions to find
                  him; his wife is a wholesome Christian woman; and if the little one be tired by
                  the time you get there, you<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7945-00000164"/> might do
                  worse than stop two or three days with them. It's a brave city; seems made to have
                  a good time in. Come, you let her just run up to the convent to bid good-by to the
                  Mother Theresa and the sisters."</p>
               <p>"I don't care where she goes," said Elsie, ungraciously.</p>
               <p>"There, now!" said Jocunda, coming out,—"Agnes, your grandmother bids you go to
                  the convent to say good-by to the sisters; so run along, there's a little dear.
                  The Mother Theresa talks of nothing else but you since she heard that you
                  meditated this; and she has broken in two her own piece of the True Cross which
                  she's carried in the gold and pearl reliquary that the Queen sent her, and means
                  to give it to you. One does n't halve such gifts, without one's whole heart goes
                  with them."</p>
               <p>"Dear mother!" said Agnes, her eyes filling with tears. "I will take her some
                  flowers and oranges for the last time. Do you know, Jocunda, I feel that I never
                  shall come back here to this dear little home where I have been so
                  happy?—everything sounds so mournful and looks so mournful!—I love everything here
                  so much!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear child, never give in to such fancies, but pluck up heart. You will be
                  sure to have luck, wherever you go,—especially since the mother will give you that
                  holy relic. I myself had a piece of Saint John Baptist's thumb-nail sewed up in a
                  leather bag, which I wore day and night all the years I was tramping up and down
                  with my old man; but when he died, I had it buried with him to ease his soul. For
                  you see, dear, he was a trooper, and led such a rackety, up-and-down life, that I
                  doubt but his confessions were but slipshod, and he needed all the help he could
                  get, poor old soul! It's a comfort to think he has it."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Jocunda, seems to me it were better to trust to the free love of our dear
                  Lord who died for us, and pray to Him, without ceasing, for his soul."</p>
               <p>"Like enough, dearie; but then, one can't be too sure, you know. And there is n't
                  the least doubt in my mind that that was a true relic, for I got it in the sack of
                  the city of Volterra, out of the private cabinet of a noble lady, with a lot of
                  jewels and other matters that made quite a little purse for us. Ah, that was a
                  time, when that city was sacked! It was hell upon earth for three days, and all
                  our men acted like devils incarnate; but then they always will in such cases. But
                  go your ways now, dearie, and I'll stay with your grandmamma; for, please God, you
                  must be up and away with the sun to-morrow."</p>
               <p>Agnes hastily arranged a little basket of fruit and flowers, and took her way down
                  through the gorge, under the Roman bridge, through an orange-orchard, and finally
                  came out upon the sea-shore, and so along the sands below the cliffs on which the
                  old town of Sorrento is situated.</p>
               <p>So cheating and inconsistent is the human heart, especially in the feminine
                  subject, that she had more than once occasion to chide herself for the thrill with
                  which she remembered passing the cavalier once in this orange-garden, and the sort
                  of vague hope which she detected that somewhere along this road he might appear
                  again.</p>
               <p>"How perfectly wicked and depraved I must be," she said to herself, "to find any
                  pleasure in such a thought of one I should pray never to meet again!"</p>
               <p>And so the little soul went on condemning herself in those exaggerated terms which
                  the religious vocabulary of conventual life furnished ready-made for the use of
                  penitents of every degree, till by the time she arrived at the convent she could
                  scarcely have been more oppressed with a sense<pb n="328-329"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000165"/> of sin, if she had murdered her grandmother and
                  eloped with the cavalier.</p>
               <p>On her arrival in the convent court, the peaceful and dreamy stillness contrasted
                  strangely with the gorgeous brightness of the day outside. The splendid sunshine,
                  the sparkling sea, the songs of the boatmen, the brisk passage of gliding sails,
                  the bright hues of the flowers that garlanded the rocks, all seemed as if the
                  earth had been arrayed for some gala-day; but the moment she had passed the
                  portal, the silent, mossy court, with its pale marble nymph, its lull of falling
                  water, its turf snow-dropt with daisies and fragrant with blue and white violets,
                  and the surrounding cloistered walks, with their pictured figures of pious
                  history, all came with a sad and soothing influence on her nerves.</p>
               <p>The nuns, who had heard the news of the projected pilgrimage, and regarded it as
                  the commencement of that saintly career which they had always predicted for her,
                  crowded around her, kissing her hands and her robe, and entreating her prayers at
                  different shrines of especial sanctity that she might visit.</p>
               <p>The Mother Theresa took her to her cell, and there hung round her neck, by a
                  golden chain, the relic which she designed for her, and of whose genuineness she
                  appeared to possess no manner of doubt.</p>
               <p>"But how pale you are, my sweet child!" she said. "What has happened to alter you
                  so much? Your cheeks look so thin, and there are deep, dark circles round your
                  eyes."</p>
               <p>"Ah, my mother, it is because of my sins."</p>
               <p>"Your sins, dear little one! What sins can you be guilty of?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, my dear mother, I have been false to my Lord, and let the love of an earthly
                  creature into my heart."</p>
               <p>"What can you mean?" said the mother.</p>
               <p>"Alas, dear mother, the cavalier who sent that ring!" said Agnes, covering her
                  face with her hands.</p>
               <p>Now the Mother Theresa had never left the walls of that convent since she was ten
                  years old,—had seen no men except her father and uncle, who once or twice made her
                  a short call, and an old hunchback who took care of their garden, safe in his
                  armor of deformity. Her ideas on the subject of masculine attractions were,
                  therefore, as vague as might be the conceptions of the eyeless fishes in the
                  Mammoth Cave of Kentucky with regard to the fruits and flowers above ground. All
                  that portion of her womanly nature which might have throbbed lay in a dead calm.
                  Still there was a faint flutter of curiosity, as she pressed Agnes to tell her
                  story, which she did with many pauses and sobs and blushes.</p>
               <p>"And is he so very handsome, my little heart?" she said, after listening. "What
                  makes you love him so much in so little time?"</p>
               <p>"Yes,—he is beautiful as an angel."</p>
               <p>"I never saw a young man, really," said the Mother Theresa. "Uncle Angelo was
                  lame, and had gray hair; and papa was very fat, and had a red face. Perhaps he
                  looks like our picture of Saint Sebastian;—I have often thought that I might be in
                  danger of loving a young man that looked like him."</p>
               <p>"Oh, he is more beautiful than that picture or any picture!" said Agnes,
                  fervently; "and, mother, though he is excommunicated, I can't help feeling that he
                  is as good as he is beautiful. My uncle had strong hopes that he should<pb
                     n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7945-00000166"/> restore him to the True Church; and to
                  pray for his soul I am going on this pilgrimage. Father Francesco says, if I will
                  tear away and overcome this love, I shall gain so much merit that my prayers will
                  have power to save his soul. Promise me, dear mother, that you and all the sisters
                  will help me with your prayers;—help me to work out this great salvation, and then
                  I shall be so glad to come back here and spend all my life in prayer!"</p>

               <head type="sub">THE MOUNTAIN FORTRESS.</head>
               <p>AND so on a bright spring morning our pilgrims started. Whoever has traversed the
                  road from Sorrento to Naples, that wonderful path along the high rocky shores of
                  the Mediterranean, must remember it only as a wild dream of enchantment. On one
                  side lies the sea, shimmering in bands of blue, purple, and green to the swaying
                  of gentle winds, exhibiting those magical shiftings and changes of color peculiar
                  to these waves. Near the land its waters are of pale, transparent emerald, while
                  farther out they deepen into blue and thence into a violet-purple, which again,
                  towards the horizon-line, fades into misty pearl-color. The shores rise above the
                  sea in wild, bold precipices, grottoed into fantastic caverns by the action of the
                  waves, and presenting every moment some new variety of outline. As the path of the
                  traveller winds round promontories whose mountain-heights are capped by white
                  villages and silvery with olive-groves, he catches the enchanting sea-view, now at
                  this point, and now at another, with Naples glimmering through the mists in the
                  distance, and the purple sides of Vesuvius ever changing with streaks and veins of
                  cloud-shadows, while silver vapors crown the summit. Above the road the steep
                  hills seem piled up to the sky,—every spot terraced, and cultivated with some form
                  of vegetable wealth, and the wild, untamable rocks garlanded over with golden
                  broom, crimson gilly-flowers, and a thousand other bright adornments. The road<pb
                     n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7945-00000167"/> lies through villages whose gardens and
                  orange-orchards fill the air with sweet scents, and whose rose-hedges sometimes
                  pour a perfect cascade of bloom and fragrance over the walls.</p>
               <p>Our travellers started in the dewy freshness of one of those gorgeous days which
                  seem to cast an illuminating charm over everything. Even old Elsie's stern
                  features relaxed somewhat under the balmy influences of sun and sky, and Agnes's
                  young, pale face was lit up with a brighter color than for many a day before.
                  Their pilgrimage through this beautiful country had few incidents. They walked in
                  the earlier and latter parts of the day, reposing a few hours at noon near some
                  fountain or shrine by the wayside,—often experiencing the kindly veneration of the
                  simple peasantry, who cheerfully offered them refreshments, and begged their
                  prayers at the holy places whither they were going.</p>
               <p>In a few days they reached Naples, where they made a little stop with the
                  hospitable family to whom Jocunda had recommended them. From Naples their path lay
                  through the Pontine Marshes; and though the malaria makes this region a word of
                  fear, yet it is no less one of strange, soft, enchanting beauty. A wide, sea-like
                  expanse, clothed with an abundance of soft, rich grass, painted with golden bands
                  and streaks of bright yellow flowers, stretches away to a purple curtain of
                  mountains, whose romantic outline rises constantly in a thousand new forms of
                  beauty. The upland at the foot of these mountains is beautifully diversified with
                  tufts of trees, and the contrast of the purple softness of the distant hills with
                  the dazzling gold and emerald of the wide meadow-tracts they enclose is a striking
                  feature in the landscape. Droves of silver-haired oxen, with their great, dreamy,
                  dark eyes and polished black horns, were tranquilly feeding knee-deep in the lush,
                  juicy grass, and herds of buffaloes, uncouth, but harmless, might be seen
                  pasturing or reposing in the distance. On either side of the way were waving
                  tracts of yellow fleur-de-lis, and beds of arum, with its arrowy leaves and white
                  blossoms. It was a wild luxuriance of growth, a dreamy stillness of solitude, so
                  lovely that one could scarce remember that it was deadly.</p>
               <p>Elsie was so impressed with the fear of the malaria, that she trafficked with an
                  honest peasant, who had been hired to take back to Rome the horses which had been
                  used to convey part of the suite of a nobleman travelling to Naples, to give them
                  a quicker passage across than they could have made on foot. It is true that this
                  was quite contrary to the wishes of Agnes, who felt that the journey ought to be
                  performed in the most toilsome and self-renouncing way, and that they should trust
                  solely to prayer and spiritual protection to ward off the pestilential
                  exhalations.</p>
               <p>In vain she quoted the Psalm, "Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night,
                  nor for the arrow that flieth by day, nor for the pestilence that walketh in
                  darkness, nor for the destruction that wasteth at noon-day," and adduced cases of
                  saints who had walked unhurt through all sorts of dangers.</p>
               <p>"There's no use talking, child," said Elsie. "I'm older than you, and have seen
                  more of real men and women; and whatever they did in old times, I know that
                  nowadays the saints don't help those that don't take care of themselves; and the
                  long and the short of it is, we must ride across those marshes, and get out of
                  them as quick as possible, or we shall get into Paradise quicker than we want
                  to."</p>
               <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7945-00000168"/>
               <p>In common with many other professing Christians, Elsie felt that going to Paradise
                  was the very dismallest of alternatives,—a thing to be staved off as long as
                  possible.</p>
               <p>After many days of journeying, the travellers, somewhat weary and foot-sore, found
                  themselves in a sombre and lonely dell of the mountains, about an hour before the
                  going down of the sun. The slanting yellow beams turned to silvery brightness the
                  ashy foliage of the gnarled old olives, which gaunt and weird clung with their
                  great, knotty, straggling roots to the rocky mountain-sides. Before them, the
                  path, stony, steep, and winding, was rising upward and still upward, and no
                  shelter for the night appeared, except in a distant mountain-town, which, perched
                  airily as an eagle's nest on its hazy height, reflected from the dome of its
                  church and its half-ruined old feudal tower the golden light of sunset. A
                  drowsy-toned bell was ringing out the Ave Maria over the wide purple solitude of
                  mountains, whose varying outlines were rising around.</p>
               <p>"You are tired, my little heart," said old Elsie to Agnes, who had drooped during
                  a longer walk than usual.</p>
               <p>"No, grandmamma," said Agnes, sinking on her knees to repeat her evening prayer,
                  which she did, covering her face with her hands.</p>
               <p>Old Elsie kneeled too; but, as she was praying,—being a thrifty old body in the
                  use of her time,—she cast an eye up the steep mountain-path and calculated the
                  distance of the little airy village. Just at that moment she saw two or three
                  horsemen, who appeared to be stealthily observing them from behind the shadow of
                  some large rocks.</p>
               <p>When their devotions were finished, she hurried on her grandchild, saying,—</p>
               <p>"Come, dearie! it must be we shall find a shelter soon."</p>
               <p>The horsemen now rode up behind them.</p>
               <p>"Good-evening, mother!" said one of them, speaking from under the shadow of a
                  deeply slouched hat.</p>
               <p>Elsie made no reply, but hurried forward.</p>
               <p>"Good-evening, pretty maid!" he said again, riding still nearer.</p>
               <p>"Go your ways in the name of God," said Elsie. "We are pilgrims, going for our
                  souls to Rome; and whoever hinders us will have the saints to deal with."</p>
               <p>"Who talks of hindering you, mother?" responded the other. "On the contrary, we
                  come for the express purpose of helping you along."</p>
               <p>"We want none of your help," said Elsie, gruffly.</p>
               <p>"See, now, how foolish you are!" said the horseman. "Don't you see that that town
                  is a good seven miles off, and not a bit of bed or supper to be had till you get
                  there, and the sun will be down soon? So mount up behind me, and here is a horse
                  for the little one."</p>
               <p>In fact, the horsemen at this moment opening disclosed to view a palfrey with a
                  lady's saddle, richly caparisoned, as if for a person of condition. With a sudden
                  movement, two of the men dismounted, confronted the travellers, and the one who
                  had acted as spokesman, approaching Agnes, said, in a tone somewhat
                  imperative,—</p>
               <p>"Come, young lady, it is our master's will that your poor little feet should have
                  some rest."</p>
               <p>And before Agnes could remonstrate, he raised her into the saddle as easily as if
                  she had been a puff of thistle-down, and then turning to Elsie, he said,—</p>
               <p>"For you, good mother, if you wish to keep up, you must e'en be content with a
                  seat behind me."</p>
               <p>"Who are you? and how dare you?" said Elsie, indignantly.</p>
               <pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7945-00000169"/>
               <p>"Good mother," said the man, "you see God's will is that you should submit,
                  because we are four to you two, and there are fifty more within call. So get up
                  without more words, and I swear by the Holy Virgin no harm shall be done you."</p>
               <p>Elsie looked and saw Agnes already some distance before her, the bridle of her
                  palfrey being held by one of the horsemen, who rode by her side and seemed to look
                  after her carefully; and so, without more ado, she accepted the services of the
                  man, and, placing her foot on the toe of his riding-boot, mounted to the crupper
                  behind him.</p>
               <p>"That is right," said he. "Now hold on to me lustily, and be not afraid."</p>
               <p>So saying, the whole troop began winding as rapidly as possible up the steep,
                  rocky path to the mountain-town.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the surprise and alarm of this most unexpected adventure, Agnes,
                  who had been at the very point of exhaustion from fatigue, could not but feel the
                  sensation of relief and repose which the seat in an easy saddle gave her. The
                  mountain air, as they arose, breathed fresh and cold on her brow, and a prospect
                  of such wondrous beauty unrolled beneath her feet that her alarm soon became lost
                  in admiration. The mountains that rose everywhere around them seemed to float in a
                  transparent sea of luminous vapor, with olive-orchards and well-tilled fields
                  lying in far, dreamy distances below, while out towards the horizon silver gleams
                  of the Mediterranean gradually widened to the view. Soothed by the hour, refreshed
                  by the air, and filled with admiration for the beauty of all she saw, she
                  surrendered herself to her situation with a feeling of solemn religious calm, as
                  to some unfolding of the Divine Will, which might unroll like the landscape
                  beneath her. They pursued their way in silence, rising higher and higher out of
                  the shadows of the deep valleys below, the man who conducted them observing a
                  strict reserve, but seeming to have a care for their welfare.</p>
               <p>The twilight yet burned red in the sky, and painted with solemn lights the mossy
                  walls of the little old town, as they plunged under a sombre antique gate-way, and
                  entered on a street as damp and dark as a cellar, which went up almost
                  perpendicularly between tall, black stone walls that seemed to have neither
                  windows nor doors. Agnes could only remember clambering upward, turning short
                  corners, clattering down steep stone steps, under low archways, along narrow,
                  ill-smelling passages, where the light that seemed so clear without the town was
                  almost extinguished in utter night.</p>
               <p>At last they entered the damp court of a huge, irregular pile of stone buildings.
                  Here the men suddenly drew up, and Agnes's conductor, dismounting, came and took
                  her silently from her saddle, saying briefly, "Come this way."</p>
               <p>Elsie sprang from her seat in a moment, and placed herself at the side of her
                  child.</p>
               <p>"No, good mother," said the man with whom she had ridden, seizing her powerfully
                  by the shoulders, and turning her round.</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?" said Elsie, fiercely. "Are you going to keep me from my own
                  child?"</p>
               <p>"Patience!" replied the man. "You can't help yourself, so recommend yourself to
                  God, and no harm shall come to you."</p>
               <p>Agnes looked back at her grandmother.</p>
               <p>"Fear not, dear grandmamma," she said, "the blessed angels will watch over
                  us."</p>
               <pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7945-00000170"/>
               <p>As she spoke, she followed her conductor through long, damp, mouldering passages,
                  and up flights of stone steps, and again through other long passages, smelling of
                  mould and damp, till at last he opened the door of an apartment from which
                  streamed a light so dazzling to the eyes of Agnes that at first she could form no
                  distinct conception as to where she was.</p>
               <p>As soon as her eyesight cleared, she found herself in an apartment which to her
                  simplicity seemed furnished with an unheard-of luxury. The walls were richly
                  frescoed and gilded, and from a chandelier of Venetian glass the light fell upon a
                  foot-cloth of brilliant tapestry which covered the marble floor. Gilded chairs and
                  couches, covered with the softest Genoese velvet, invited to repose; while tables
                  inlaid with choice mosaics stood here and there, sustaining rare vases, musical
                  instruments, and many of the light, fanciful ornaments with which, in those days,
                  the halls of women of condition were graced. At one end of the apartment was an
                  alcove, where the rich velvet curtains were looped away with heavy cords and
                  tassels of gold, displaying a smaller room, where was a bed with hangings of
                  crimson satin embroidered with gold.</p>
               <p>Agnes stood petrified with amazement, and put her hand to her head, as if to
                  assure herself by the sense of touch that she was not dreaming, and then, with an
                  impulse of curious wonder, began examining the apartment. The rich furniture and
                  the many adornments, though only such as were common in the daily life of the
                  great at that period, had for her simple eyes all the marvellousness of the most
                  incredible illusion. She touched the velvet couches almost with fear, and passed
                  from object to object in a sort of maze. When she arrived at the alcove, she
                  thought she heard a slight rustling within, and then a smothered laugh. Her heart
                  beat quick as she stopped to listen. There was a tittering sound, and a movement
                  as if some one were shaking the curtain, and at last Giulietta stood in the
                  door-way.</p>
               <p>For a moment Agnes stood looking at her in utter bewilderment. Yes, surely it was
                  Giulietta, dressed out in all the bravery of splendid apparel, her black hair
                  shining and lustrous, great solid ear-rings of gold shaking in her ears, and a row
                  of gold coins displayed around her neck.</p>
               <p>She broke into a loud laugh at the sight of Agnes's astonished face.</p>
               <p>"So, here you are!" she said. "Well, now, did n't I tell you so? You see he was in
                  love with you, just as I said; and if you would n't come to him of your own
                  accord, he must fly off with you."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Giulietta!" said Agnes, springing towards her and catching her hands, "what
                  does all this mean? and where have they carried poor grandmamma?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, never worry about her! Do you know you are in high favor here, and any one
                  who belongs to you gets good quarters? Your grandmother just now is at supper, I
                  doubt not, with my mother; and a jolly time they will have of it, gossiping
                  together."</p>
               <p>"Your mother here, too?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, simple, to be sure! I found it so much easier living here than in the old
                  town, that I sent for her, that she might have peace in her old age.—But how do
                  you like your room? Were you not astonished to see it so brave? Know, then, pretty
                  one, that it is all on account of the good courage of our band. For, you see, the
                  people there in Rome (we won't say who) had given away all our captain's lands and
                  palaces and villas to this one and that, as pleased<pb n="340-341"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000171"/> them; and one pretty little villa in the mountains
                  not far from here went to a stout old cardinal. What does a band of our men do,
                  one night, but pounce on old red-hat and tie him up, while they helped themselves
                  to what they liked through the house? True, they could n't bring house and all;
                  but they brought stores of rich furnishing, and left him thanking the saints that
                  he was yet alive. So we arranged your rooms right nobly, thinking to please our
                  captain when he comes. If you are not pleased, you will be ungrateful, that's
                  all."</p>
               <p>"Giulietta," said Agnes, who had scarcely seemed to listen to this prattle, so
                  anxious was she to speak of what lay nearest her heart, "I want to see grandmamma.
                  Can't you bring her to me?"</p>
               <p>"No, my little princess, I can't. Do you know you are my mistress now? Well, you
                  are; but there's one that's master of us both, and he says none must speak with
                  you till he has seen you."</p>
               <p>"And is he here?"</p>
               <p>"No, he has been some time gone Northward, and has not returned,—though we expect
                  him to-night. So compose yourself, and ask for anything in the world, but to see
                  your grandmother, and I will show that I am your humble servant to command."</p>
               <p>So saying, Giulietta courtesied archly and laughed, showing her white, shiny
                  teeth, which looked as bright as pearls.</p>
               <p>Agnes sat down on one of the velvet couches, and leaned her head on her hand.</p>
               <p>"Come, now, let me bring you some supper," said Giulietta. "What say you to a nice
                  roast fowl and a bottle of wine?"</p>
               <p>"How can you speak of such things in the holy time of Lent?" said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"Oh, never you fear about that! Our holy Father Stefano sets such matters right
                  for any of us in a twinkling, and especially would he do it for you."</p>
               <p>"Oh, but Giulietta, I don't want anything. I could n't eat, if I were to try."</p>
               <p>"Ta, ta, ta!" said Giulietta, going out. "Wait till you smell it. I shall be back
                  in a little while."</p>
               <p>And she left the room, locking the door after her.</p>
               <p>In a few moments she returned, bearing a rich silver tray, on which was a covered
                  dish that steamed a refreshing odor, together with a roll of white bread, and a
                  small glass <foreign xml:lang="FRA">flacon</foreign> containing a little choice
                  wine.</p>
               <p>By much entreaty and coaxing, Agnes was induced to partake of the bread, enough to
                  revive her somewhat after the toils of the day; and then, a little reassured by
                  the familiar presence of Giulietta, she began to undress, her former companion
                  officiously assisting her.</p>
               <p>"There, now, you are tired, my lady princess," she said. "I'll unlace your bodice.
                  One of these days your gowns will be all of silk, and stiff with gold and
                  pearls."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Giulietta," said Agnes, "don't!—let me,—I don't need help."</p>
               <p>"Ta, ta, ta!—you must learn to be waited on," said Giulietta, persisting. "But,
                  Holy Virgin! what is the matter here? Oh, Agnes, what <emph>are</emph> you doing
                  to yourself?"</p>
               <p>"It's a penance Giulietta," said Agnes, her face flushing.</p>
               <p>"Well, I should think it was! Father Francesco ought to be ashamed of himself; he
                  is a real butcher!"</p>
               <p>"He does it to save my soul, Giulietta. The cross of our Lord without will heal a
                  deadly wound within."</p>
               <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7945-00000172"/>
               <p>In her heart, Giulietta had somewhat of secret reverence for such austerities,
                  which the whole instruction of her time and country taught her to regard as
                  especially saintly. People who live in the senses more than in the world of
                  reflection feel the force of such outward appeals. Giulietta made the sign of the
                  cross, and looked grave for several minutes.</p>
               <p>"Poor little dove!" she said at last, "if your sins must needs be expiated so,
                  what will become of me? It must be that you will lay up stores of merit with God;
                  for surely your sins do not need <emph>all</emph> this. Agnes, you will be a saint
                  some day, like your namesake at the Convent, I truly do believe."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, no, Giulietta! don't talk so! God knows I wrestle with forbidden thoughts
                  all the while. I am no saint, but the chief of sinners."</p>
               <p>"That's what the saints all say," said Giulietta. "But, my dear princess, when
                     <emph>he</emph> comes, he will forbid this; he is lordly, and will not suffer
                  his little wife"——</p>
               <p>"Giulietta, don't speak so,—I cannot hear it,—I must not be his wife,—I am vowed
                  to be the spouse of the Lord."</p>
               <p>"And yet you love our handsome prince," said Giulietta; "and there is the great
                  sin you are breaking your little heart about. Well, now, it's all of that dry,
                  sour old Father Francesco. I never could abide him,—he made such dismal pother
                  about sin; old Father Girolamo was worth a dozen of him. If you would just see our
                  good Father Stefano, now, he would set your mind at ease about your vows in a
                  twinkling; and you must needs get them loosed, for our captain is born to command,
                  and when princes stoop to us peasant-girls, it is n't for us to say nay. It's
                  being good as Saint Michael himself for him to think of you only in the holy way
                  of marriage. I'll warrant me, there's many a lord cardinal at Rome that is n't so
                  good; and as to princes, he is one of a thousand, a most holy and religious
                  knight, or he would do as others do when they have the power."</p>
               <p>Agnes, confused and agitated, turned away, and, as if seeking refuge, laid her
                  down in the bed, looking timidly up at the unwonted splendor,—and then, hiding her
                  face in the pillow, began repeating a prayer.</p>
               <p>Giulietta sat by her a moment, till she felt, from the relaxing of the little
                  hand, that the reaction of fatigue and intense excitement was beginning to take
                  place. Nature would assert her rights, and the heavy curtain of sleep fell on the
                  weary little head. Quietly extinguishing the lights, Giulietta left the room,
                  locking the door.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE CRISIS.</head>
               <p>AGNES was so entirely exhausted with bodily fatigue and mental agitation that she
                  slept soundly till awakened by the beams of the morning sun. Her first glance up
                  at the gold-embroidered curtains of her bed occasioned a bewildered surprise;—she
                  raised herself and looked around, slowly recovering her consciousness and the
                  memory of the strange event which had placed her where she was. She rose hastily
                  and went to the window to look out. This window was in a kind of circular tower
                  projecting from the side of the building, such as one often sees in old Norman
                  architecture;—it overhung not only a wall of dizzy height, but a precipice with a
                  sheer descent of some thousand feet; and far below, spread out like a map in the
                  distance, lay a prospect of enchanting richness. The eye might wander over
                  orchards of silvery olives, plantations with their rows of mulberry-trees
                  supporting the vines, now in the first tender spring green, scarlet fields of
                  clover, and patches where the young corn was just showing its waving blades above
                  the brown soil. Here and there rose tufts of stone-pines with their dark
                  umbrella-tops towering above all other foliage, while far off in the blue distance
                  a silvery belt of glittering spangles showed where the sea closed in the
                  horizon-line. So high was the perch, so distant and dreamy the prospect, that
                  Agnes felt a sensation of giddiness, as if she were suspended over it in the
                  air,—and turned away from the window, to look again at what seemed to her the
                  surprising and unheard-of splendors of the apartment. There lay her simple peasant
                  garb on the rich velvet couch,—a strange sight in the midst of so much luxury.
                  Having dressed herself, she sat down, and, covering her face with her hands, tried
                  to reflect calmly on the position in which she was placed.</p>
               <p>With the education she had received, she could look on this strange interruption
                  of her pilgrimage only as a special assault upon her faith, instigated by those
                  evil spirits that are ever setting themselves in conflict with the just. Such
                  trials had befallen saints of whom she had read. They had been assailed by visions
                  of worldly ease and luxury suddenly presented before them, for which they were
                  tempted to deny their faith and sell their souls. Was it not, perhaps, as a
                  punishment for having admitted the love of an excommunicated heretic into her
                  heart, that this sore trial had been permitted to come upon her? And if she should
                  fail? She shuddered, when she recalled the severe and terrible manner in which
                  Father Francesco had warned her against yielding to the solicitations of an
                  earthly love. To her it seemed as if that holy man must have been inspired with a
                  prophetic foresight of her present position, and warned her against it. Those
                  awful words came burning into her mind as when they seemed to issue like the voice
                  of a spirit from the depths of the confessional:—"<emph>If ever you should yield
                     to his love, and turn back from this heavenly marriage to follow him, you will
                     accomplish his damnation and your own</emph>."</p>
               <p>Agnes trembled in an agony of real belief, and with a vivid terror of the world to
                  come such as belonged to the almost physical certainty with which the religious
                  teaching of her time presented it to the popular mind. Was she,<pb n="346-347"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000174"/> indeed, the cause of such awful danger to his soul?
                  Might a false step now, a faltering human weakness, indeed plunge that soul, so
                  dear, into a fiery abyss without bottom or shore? Should she forever hear his
                  shrieks of torture and despair, his curses on the hour he had first known her? Her
                  very blood curdled, her nerves froze, as she thought of it, and she threw herself
                  on her knees and prayed with an anguish that brought the sweat in beaded drops to
                  her forehead,—strange dew for so frail a lily!—and her prayer rose above all
                  intercession of saints, above the seat even of the Virgin Mother herself, to the
                  heart of her Redeemer, to Him who some divine instinct told her was alone mighty
                  to save. We of the present day may look on her distress as unreal, as the result
                  of a misguided sense of religious obligation; but the great Hearer of Prayer
                  regards each heart in its own scope of vision, and helps not less the mistaken
                  than the enlightened distress. And for that matter, who is enlightened? who
                  carries to God's throne a trouble or a temptation in which there is
                     <emph>not</emph> somewhere a misconception or a mistake?</p>
               <p>And so it came to pass. Agnes rose from prayer with an experience which has been
                  common to the members of the True Invisible Church, whether Catholic, Greek, or
                  Protestant. "In the day when I cried Thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me
                  with strength in my soul." She had that vivid sense of the sustaining presence and
                  sympathy of an Almighty Saviour which is the substance of which all religious
                  forms and appliances are the shadows; her soul was stayed on God, and was at
                  peace, as truly as if she had been the veriest Puritan maiden that ever worshipped
                  in a New-England meeting-house. She felt a calm superiority to all things
                  earthly,—a profound reliance on that invisible aid which comes from God alone.</p>
               <p>She was standing at her window, deep in thought, when Giulietta entered,—fresh and
                  blooming,—bearing the breakfast-tray.</p>
               <p>"Come, my little princess, here I am," she said, "with your breakfast! How do you
                  find yourself, this morning?"</p>
               <p>Agnes came towards her.</p>
               <p>"Bless us, how grave we are!" said Giulietta. "What has come over us?"</p>
               <p>"Giulietta, have you seen poor grandmamma this morning?"</p>
               <p>"Poor grandmamma!" said Giulietta, mimicking the sad tone in which Agnes
                  spoke,—"to be sure I have. I left her making a hearty breakfast. So fall to, and
                  do the same,—for you don't know who may come to see you this morning."</p>
               <p>"Giulietta, is he here?"</p>
               <p>"He!" said Giulietta, laughing. "Do hear the little bird! It begins to chirp
                  already! No, he is not here yet; but Pietro says he will come soon, and Pietro
                  knows all his movements."</p>
               <p>"Pietro is your husband?" said Agnes, inquiringly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, to be sure,—and a pretty good one, too, as men go," said Giulietta. "They
                  are sorry bargains, the best of them. But you'll get a prize, if you play your
                  cards well. Do you know that the King of Naples and the King of France have both
                  sent messages to our captain? Our men hold all the passes between Rome and Naples,
                  and so every one sees the sense of gaining our captain's favor. But eat your
                  breakfast, little one, while I go and see to Pietro and the men."</p>
               <p>So saying, she bustled out of the room, locking the door behind her.</p>
               <pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7945-00000175"/>
               <p>Agnes took a little bread and water,—resolved to fast and pray, as the only
                  defence against the danger in which she stood.</p>
               <p>After breakfasting, she retired into the inner room, and, opening the window, sat
                  down and looked out on the prospect, and then, in a low voice, began singing a
                  hymn of Savonarola's, which had been taught her by her uncle. It was entitled,
                  "Christ's Call to the Soul." The words were conceived in that tender spirit of
                  mystical devotion which characterizes all this class of productions. <q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>While Agnes was singing, the door of the outer room was slowly opened, and
                  Agostino Sarelli entered. He had just returned from Florence, having ridden day
                  and night to meet her whom he expected to find within the walls of his
                  fastness.</p>
               <p>He entered so softly that Agnes did not hear his approach, and he stood listening
                  to her singing. He had come back with his mind burning with indignation against
                  the Pope and the whole hierarchy then ruling in Rome; but conversation with Father
                  Antonio and the scenes he had witnessed at San Marco had converted the blind sense
                  of personal wrong into a fixed principle of moral indignation and opposition. He
                  no longer found himself checked by the pleading of his early religious
                  recollections; for now he had a leader who realized in his own person all his
                  conceptions of those primitive apostles and holy bishops who first fed the flock
                  of the Lord in Italy. He had heard from his lips the fearless declaration, "If
                  Rome is against me, know that it is not contrary to me, but to Christ, and its
                  controversy is with God: doubt not that God will conquer;" and he embraced the
                  cause with all the enthusiasm of patriotism and knighthood. In his view, the most
                  holy place of his religion had been taken by a robber, who reigned in the name of
                  Christ only to disgrace it; and he felt called to pledge his sword, his life, his
                  knightly honor to do battle against him. He had urged his uncle in Milan to make
                  interest for the cause of Savonarola with the King of France; and his uncle, with
                  that crafty diplomacy which in those days formed the staple of what was called
                  statesmanship, had seemed to listen favorably to his views,—intending, however, no
                  more by his apparent assent than to withdraw his nephew from the dangers in which
                  he stood in Italy, and bring him under his own influence and guardianship in the
                  court of France. But the wily diplomate had sent Agostino Sarelli from his
                  presence with the highest possible expectations of his influence both with the
                  King of France and the Emperor of Germany in the present religious crisis in
                  Italy.</p>
               <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC7945-00000176"/>
               <p>And now the time was come, Agostino thought, to break the spell under which Agnes
                  was held,—to show her the true character of the men whom she was beholding through
                  a mist of veneration arising entirely from the dewy freshness of ignorant
                  innocence. All the way home from Florence he had urged his horse onward, burning
                  to meet her, to tell her all that he knew and felt, to claim her as his own, and
                  to take her into the sphere of light and liberty in which he himself moved. He did
                  not doubt his power, when she should once be where he could speak with her freely,
                  without fear of interruption. Hers was a soul too good and pure, he said, to be
                  kept in chains of slavish ignorance any longer. When she ceased singing, he spoke
                  from the outer apartment,—"Agnes!"</p>
               <p>The name was uttered in the softest tone, but it sent the blood to her heart, as
                  if it were the summons of doom. Everything seemed to swim before her, and grow
                  dark for a moment; but by a strong effort she lifted her heart in prayer, and,
                  rising, came towards him.</p>
               <p>Agostino had figured her to himself in all that soft and sacred innocence and
                  freshness of bloom in which he had left her, a fair angel child, looking through
                  sad, innocent eyes on a life whose sins and sorrows, and deeper loves and hates,
                  she scarcely comprehended,—one that he might fold in his arms with protecting
                  tenderness, while he gently reasoned with her fears and prejudices; but the figure
                  that stood there in the curtained arch, with its solemn, calm, transparent
                  paleness of face, its large, intense dark eyes, now vivid with some mysterious and
                  concentrated resolve, struck a strange chill over him. Was it Agnes or a
                  disembodied spirit that stood before him? For a few moments there fell such a
                  pause between them as the intensity of some unexpressed feeling often brings with
                  it, and which seems like a spell.</p>
               <p>"Agnes! Agnes! is it you?" at last said the knight, in a low, hesitating tone.
                  "Oh, my love, what has changed you so? Speak!—do speak! Are you angry with me? Are
                  you angry that I brought you here?"</p>
               <p>"My Lord, I am not angry," said Agnes, speaking in a cold, sad tone; "but you have
                  committed a great sin in turning aside those vowed to a holy pilgrimage, and you
                  tempt me to sin by this conversation, which ought not to be between us."</p>
               <p>"Why not?" said Agostino. "You would not see me at Sorrento. I sought to warn you
                  of the dangers of this pilgrimage,—to tell you that Rome is not what you think it
                  is,—that it is not the seat of Christ, but a foul cage of unclean birds, a den of
                  wickedness,—that he they call Pope is a vile impostor"——</p>
               <p>"My Lord," said Agnes, speaking with a touch of something even commanding in her
                  tone, "you have me at advantage, it is true, but you ought not to use it in trying
                  to ruin my soul by blaspheming holy things." And then she added, in a tone of
                  indescribable sadness, "Alas, that so noble and beautiful a soul should be in
                  rebellion against the only True Church! Have you forgotten that good mother you
                  spoke of? What must she feel to know that her son is an infidel!"</p>
               <p>"I am not an infidel, Agnes; I am a true knight of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
                  Christ, and a believer in the One True, Holy Church."</p>
               <p>"How can that be?" said Agnes. "Ah, seek not to deceive me! My Lord, such a poor
                  little girl as I am is not worth the pains."</p>
               <pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7945-00000177"/>
               <p>"By the Holy Mother, Agnes, by the Holy Cross, I do not seek to deceive you! I
                  speak on my honor as a knight and gentleman. I love you truly and honorably, and
                  seek you among all women as my spotless wife, and would I lie to
                  <emph>you?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"My Lord, you have spoken words which it is a sin for me to hear, a peril to your
                  soul to say; and if you had not, you must not seek me as a wife. Holy vows are
                  upon me. I must be the wife of no man here; it is a sin even to think of it."</p>
               <p>"Impossible, Agnes!" said Agostino, with a start. "You have not taken the veil
                  already? If you had"——</p>
               <p>"No, my Lord, I have not. I have only promised and vowed in my heart to do so when
                  the Lord shall open the way."</p>
               <p>"But such vows, dear Agnes, are often dispensed; they may be loosed by the priest.
                  Now hear me,—only hear me. I believe as your uncle believes,—your good, pious
                  uncle, whom you love so much. I have taken the sacrament from his hand; he has
                  blessed me as a son. I believe as Jerome Savonarola believes. He it is, that holy
                  prophet, who has proclaimed this Pope and his crew to be vile usurpers, reigning
                  in the name of Christ."</p>
               <p>"My Lord! my Lord! I must not hear more! I must not,—I cannot,—I will not!" said
                  Agnes, becoming violently agitated, as she found herself listening with interest
                  to the pleadings of her lover.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Agnes, what has turned your heart against me? I thought you promised to love
                  me a little?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, hush! hush! don't plead with me!" she said, with a wild, affrighted look.</p>
               <p>He sought to come towards her, and she sprang forward and threw herself at his
                  feet.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my Lord, for mercy's sake let me go! Let us go on our way! We will pray for
                  you always,—yes, always!" And she looked up at him in an agony of earnestness.</p>
               <p>"Am I so hateful to you, then, Agnes?"</p>
               <p>"Hateful? Oh, no, no! God knows you are——I—I—yes, I love you too well, and you
                  have too much power over me; but, oh, do not use it! If I hear you talk I shall
                  yield,—I surely shall, and we shall be lost, both of us! Oh, my God! I shall be
                  the means of your damnation!"</p>
               <p>"Agnes!"</p>
               <p>"It is true! it is true! Oh, do not talk to me, but promise me, promise me, or I
                  shall die! Have pity on me! have pity on yourself!"</p>
               <p>In the agony of her feelings her voice became almost a shriek, and her wild,
                  affrighted face had a deadly pallor; she looked like one in a death-agony.
                  Agostino was alarmed, and hastened to soothe her, by promising whatever she
                  required.</p>
               <p>"Agnes, dear Agnes, I submit; only be calm. I promise anything,—anything in the
                  wide world you can ask."</p>
               <p>"Will you let me go?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"And will you let my poor grandmamma go with me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"And you will not talk with me any more?"</p>
               <p>"Not if you do not wish it. And now," he said, "that I have submitted to all these
                  hard conditions, will you suffer me to raise you?"</p>
               <p>He took her hands and lifted her up; they were cold, and she was trembling and
                  shivering. He held them a moment; she tried to withdraw them, and he let them
                  go.</p>
               <p>"Farewell, Agnes!" he said. "I am going."</p>
               <pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7945-00000178"/>
               <p>She raised both her hands and pressed the sharp cross to her bosom, but made no
                  answer.</p>
               <p>"I yield to your will," he continued. "Immediately when I leave you, your
                  grandmother will come to you, and the attendants who brought you here will conduct
                  you to the high-road. For me, since it is your will, I part here. Farewell,
                  Agnes!"</p>
               <p>He held out his hand, but she stood as before, pale and silent, with her hands
                  clasped on her breast.</p>
               <p>"Do your vows forbid even a farewell to a poor, humble friend?" said the knight,
                  in a low tone.</p>
               <p>"I cannot," said Agnes, speaking at broken intervals, in a suffocating voice,—"for
                     <emph>your</emph> sake I cannot! I bear this pain for you,—for
                     <emph>you!</emph> Oh, repent, and meet me in heaven!"</p>
               <p>She gave him her hand; she kneeled and kissed it, pressed it to his forehead, then
                  rose and left the room.</p>
               <p>For a moment after the departure of the cavalier, Agnes felt a bitter pang,—the
                  pain which one feels on first realizing that a dear friend is lost forever; and
                  then, rousing herself with a start and a sigh, she hurried into the inner room and
                  threw herself on her knees, giving thanks that the dreadful trial was past, and
                  that she had not been left to fail.</p>
               <p>In a few moments she heard the voice of her grandmother in the outer apartment,
                  and the old wrinkled creature clasped her grandchild in her arms, and wept with a
                  passionate abandonment of fondness, calling her by every tender and endearing name
                  which mothers give to their infants.</p>
               <p>"After all," said Elsie, "these are not such bad people, and I have been right
                  well entertained among them. They are of ourselves,—they do not prey on the poor,
                  but only on our enemies, the princes and nobles, who look on us as sheep to be
                  shorn and slaughtered for their wearing and eating. These men are none such, but
                  pitiful to poor peasants and old widows, whom they feed and clothe out of the
                  spoils of the rich. As to their captain,—would you believe it?—he is the same
                  handsome gentleman who once gave you a ring,—you may have forgotten him, as you
                  never think of such things, but I knew him in a moment,—and such a religious man,
                  that no sooner did he find that we were pilgrims on a holy errand, than he gave
                  orders to have us set free with all honor, and a band of the best of them to
                  escort us through the mountains; and the people of the town are all moved to do us
                  reverence, and coming with garlands and flowers to wish us well and ask our
                  prayers. So let us set forth immediately."</p>
               <p>Agnes followed her grandmother through the long passages and down the dark, mouldy
                  stairway to the court-yard, where two horses were standing caparisoned for them. A
                  troop of men in high peaked hats, cloaked and plumed, were preparing also to
                  mount, while a throng of women and children stood pressing around. When Agnes
                  appeared, enthusiastic cries were heard: "<foreign xml:lang="ITA">Viva Jesù!"
                     "Viva Maria!" "Viva! viva Jesù! nostro Rè!</foreign>" and showers of
                  myrtle-branches and garlands fell around. "Pray for us!" "Pray for us, holy
                  pilgrims!" was uttered eagerly by one and another. Mothers held up their children;
                  and beggars and cripples, aged and sick,—never absent in an Italian town,—joined
                  with loud cries in the general enthusiasm. Agnes stood amid it all, pale and
                  serene, with that elevated expression of heavenly calm on her features which is
                  often the clear shining of the soul after the wrench and torture of some great
                  interior conflict. She felt that the last earthly<pb n="356-357"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000179"/> chain was broken, and that now she belonged to
                  Heaven alone. She scarcely saw or heard what was around her, wrapt in the calm of
                  inward prayer.</p>
               <p>"Look at her! she is beautiful as the Madonna!" said one and another. "She is
                  divine as Santa Catarina!" said others. "She might have been the wife of our
                  chief, who is a nobleman of the oldest blood, but she chose to be the bride of the
                  Lord," said others: for Giulietta, with a woman's love of romancing, had not
                  failed to make the most among her companions of the love-adventures of Agnes.</p>
               <p>Agnes meanwhile was seated on her palfrey, and the whole train passed out of the
                  court-yard into the dim, narrow street,—men, women, and children following. On
                  reaching the public square, they halted a moment by the side of the antique
                  fountain to water their horses. The groups that surrounded it at this time were
                  such as a painter would have delighted to copy. The women and girls of this
                  obscure mountain-town had all that peculiar beauty of form and attitude which
                  appears in the studies of the antique; and as they poised on their heads their
                  copper water-jars of the old Etruscan pattern, they seemed as if they might be
                  statues of golden bronze, had not the warm tints of their complexion, the
                  brilliancy of their large eyes, and the bright picturesque colors of their attire
                  given the richness of painting to their classic outlines. Then, too, the men, with
                  their finely-moulded limbs, their figures so straight and strong and elastic,
                  their graceful attitudes, and their well-fitting, showy costumes, formed a no less
                  imposing feature in the scene. Among them all sat Agnes waiting on her palfrey,
                  seeming scarcely conscious of the enthusiasm which surrounded her. Some admiring
                  friend had placed in her hand a large bough of blossoming hawthorn, which she held
                  unconsciously, as, with a sort of childlike simplicity, she turned from right to
                  left, to make reply to the request for prayers, or to return thanks for the
                  offered benediction of some one in the crowd.</p>
               <p>When all the preparations were at last finished, the procession of mounted
                  horsemen, with a confused gathering of the population, passed down the streets to
                  the gates of the city, and as they passed they sang the words of the Crusaders'
                  Hymn, which had fluttered back into the traditionary memory of Europe from the
                  knights going to redeem the Holy Sepulchre. <q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>They were singing the second verse, as, emerging from the dark old gate-way of the
                  town, all the distant landscape of silvery olive-orchards, crimson clover-fields,
                     blossoming<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7945-00000180"/> almond-trees, fig-trees,
                  and grapevines, just in the tender green of spring, burst upon their view. Agnes
                  felt a kind of inspiration. From the high mountain elevation she could discern the
                  far-off brightness of the sea,—all between one vision of beauty,—and the religious
                  enthusiasm which possessed all around her had in her eye all the value of the most
                  solid and reasonable faith. With us, who may look on it from a colder and more
                  distant point of view, doubts may be suggested whether this <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">naïve</foreign> impressibility to religious influences, this
                  simple, whole-hearted abandonment to their expression, had any real practical
                  value. The fact that any or all of the actors might before night rob or stab or
                  lie quite as freely as if it had not occurred may well give reason for such a
                  question. Be this as it may, the phenomena is not confined to Italy or the
                  religion of the Middle Ages, but exhibits itself in many a prayer-meeting and
                  camp-meeting of modern days. For our own part, we hold it better to have even
                  transient upliftings of the nobler and more devout element of man's nature than
                  never to have any at all, and that he who goes on in worldly and sordid courses,
                  without ever a spark of religious enthusiasm or a throb of aspiration, is less of
                  a man than he who sometimes soars heaven-ward, though his wings be weak and he
                  fall again.</p>
               <p>In all this scene Agostino Sarelli took no part. He had simply given orders for
                  the safe-conduct of Agnes, and then retired to his own room. From a window,
                  however, he watched the procession as it passed through the gates of the city, and
                  his resolution was immediately taken to proceed at once by a secret path to the
                  place where the pilgrims should emerge upon the high-road.</p>
               <p>He had been induced to allow the departure of Agnes, from seeing the utter
                  hopelessness by any argument or persuasion suasion of removing a barrier that was
                  so vitally interwoven with the most sensitive religious nerves of her being. He
                  saw in her terrified looks, in the deadly paleness of her face, how real and
                  unaffected was the anguish which his words gave her; he saw that the very
                  consciousness of her own love to him produced a sense of weakness which made her
                  shrink in utter terror from his arguments.</p>
               <p>"There is no remedy," he said, "but to let her go to Rome and see with her own
                  eyes how utterly false and vain is the vision which she draws from the purity of
                  her own believing soul. What Christian would not wish that these fair dreams had
                  any earthly reality? But this gentle dove must not be left unprotected to fly into
                  that foul, unclean cage of vultures and harpies. Deadly as the peril may be to me
                  to breathe the air of Rome, I will be around her invisibly to watch over her."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">ROME.</head>
               <p>A VISION rises upon us from the land of shadows. We see a wide plain, miles and
                  miles in extent, rolling in soft billows of green, and girded on all sides by blue
                  mountains, whose silver crests gleaming in the setting sunlight tell that the
                  winter yet lingers on their tops, though spring has decked all the plain. So
                  silent, so lonely, so fair is this waving expanse with its guardian mountains, it
                  might be some wild solitude, an American prairie or Asiatic steppe, but that in
                  the midst thereof, on some billows of rolling land, we discern a city, sombre,
                  quaint, and old,—a city of dreams and mysteries,—a city of the living and the
                  dead. And this is Rome,—weird, wonderful, ancient, mighty Rome,—mighty once by
                  physical force and grandeur, mightier now in physical decadence and weakness by
                  the spell of a potent moral enchantment.</p>
               <p>As the sun is moving westward, the whole air around becomes flooded with a
                  luminousness which seems to transfuse itself with pervading presence through every
                  part of the city, and make all its ruinous and mossy age bright and living. The
                  air shivers with the silver vibrations of hundreds of bells, and the evening glory
                  goes up and down, soft-footed and angelic, transfiguring all things. The broken
                  columns of the Forum seem to swim in golden mist, and luminous floods fill the
                  Coliseum as it stands with its thousand arches looking out into the city like so
                  many sightless eye-holes in the skull of the past. The tender light pours up
                  streets dank and ill-paved,—into noisome and cavernous dens called houses, where
                  the peasantry of to-day vegetate in contented subservience. It illuminates many a
                  dingy court-yard, where the moss is green on the walls, and gurgling fountains
                  fall into quaint old sculptured basins. It lights up the gorgeous palaces of
                  Rome's modern princes, built with stones wrenched from ancient ruins. It streams
                  through a wilderness of churches, each with its tolling prayer-bell, and steals
                  through painted windows into the dazzling confusion of pictured and gilded glories
                  that glitter and gleam from roof and wall within. And it goes, too, across the
                  Tiber, up the filthy and noisome Ghetto, where, hemmed in by ghostly superstition,
                  the sons of Israel are growing up without vital day, like wan white plants in
                  cellars; and the black mournful obelisks of the cypresses in the villas around, it
                  touches with a solemn glory. The castle of St. Angelo looks like a great
                  translucent, luminous orb, and the statues of saints and apostles on the top of
                  St. John Lateran glow as if made of living fire, and seem to stretch out glorified
                  hands of welcome to the pilgrims that are approaching the Holy City across the
                  soft, palpitating sea of green that lies stretched like a misty veil around
                  it.</p>
               <p>Then, as now, Rome was an enchantress of mighty and wonderful power, with her
                  damp, and mud, and mould, her ill-fed, ill-housed populace, her ruins of old glory
                  rising dim and ghostly amid her palaces of to-day. With all her awful secrets of
                  rapine, cruelty, ambition, injustice,—with her foul orgies of unnatural
                  crime,—with the very corruption of the old buried Roman Empire steaming up as from
                  a charnel-house, and permeating all modern life with its effluvium of deadly
                  uncleanness,—still Rome had that strange,<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7945-00000182"
                  /> bewildering charm of melancholy grandeur and glory which made all hearts cleave
                  to her, and eyes and feet turn longingly towards her from the ends of the earth.
                  Great souls and pious yearned for her as for a mother, and could not be quieted
                  till they had kissed the dust of her streets. There they fondly thought was rest
                  to be found,—that rest which through all weary life ever recedes like the mirage
                  of the desert; there sins were to be shriven which no common priest might forgive,
                  and heavy burdens unbound from the conscience by an infallible wisdom; there was
                  to be revealed to the praying soul the substance of things hoped for, the evidence
                  of things not seen. Even the mighty spirit of Luther yearned for the breast of
                  this great unknown mother, and came humbly thither to seek the repose which he
                  found afterwards in Jesus.</p>
               <p>At this golden twilight-hour along the Appian Way come the pilgrims of our story
                  with prayers and tears of thankfulness. Agnes looks forward and sees the saintly
                  forms on St. John Lateran standing in a cloud of golden light and stretching out
                  protecting hands to bless her.</p>
               <p>"See, see, grandmother!" she exclaimed,—"yonder is our Father's house, and all the
                  saints beckon us home! Glory be to God who hath brought us hither!"</p>
               <p>Within the church the evening-service is going on, and the soft glory streaming in
                  reveals that dizzying confusion of riches and brightness with which the sensuous
                  and color-loving Italian delights to encircle the shrine of the Heavenly Majesty.
                  Pictured angels in cloudy wreaths smile down from the gold-fretted roofs and over
                  the round, graceful arches; and the floor seems like a translucent sea of precious
                  marbles and gems fused into solid brightness, and reflecting in long gleams and
                  streaks dim intimations of the sculptured and gilded glories above. Altar and
                  shrine are now veiled in that rich violet hue which the Church has chosen for its
                  mourning color; and violet vestments, taking the place of the gorgeous robes of
                  the ecclesiastics, tell the approach of that holy week of sadness when all
                  Christendom falls in penitence at the feet of that Almighty Love once sorrowful
                  and slain for her.</p>
               <p>The long-drawn aisles are now full to overflowing with that weird chanting which
                  one hears nowhere but in Rome at this solemn season. Those voices, neither of men
                  nor women, have a wild, morbid energy which seems to search every fibre of the
                  nervous system, and, instead of soothing or calming, to awaken strange yearning
                  agonies of pain, ghostly unquiet longings, and endless feverish, unrestful
                  cravings. The sounds now swell and flood the church as with a rushing torrent of
                  wailing and clamorous supplication,—now recede and moan themselves away to silence
                  in far-distant aisles, like the last faint sigh of discouragement and despair.
                  Anon they burst out from the room, they drop from arches and pictures, they rise
                  like steam from the glassy pavement, and, meeting, mingle in wavering clamors of
                  lamentation and shrieks of anguish. One might fancy lost souls from out the
                  infinite and dreary abysses of utter separation from God might thus wearily and
                  aimlessly moan and wail, breaking into agonized tumults of desire, and trembling
                  back into exhaustions of despair. Such music brings only throbbings and yearnings,
                  but no peace; and yonder, on the glassy floor, at the foot of a crucifix, a poor
                  mortal lies sobbing and quivering under its pitiless power, as if it had wrenched
                  every tenderest nerve of memory, and torn open every half-healed wound of the
                  soul.</p>
               <p>When the chanting ceases, he rises slow and tottering,<pb n="364-365"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000183"/> and we see in the wan face turning towards the dim
                  light the well-remembered features of Father Francesco. Driven to despair by the
                  wild, ungovernable force of his unfortunate love, weary of striving, overborne
                  with a hopeless and continually accumulating load of guilt, he had come to Rome to
                  lay down at the feet of heavenly wisdom the burden which he can no longer bear
                  alone; and rising now, he totters to a confessional where sits a holy cardinal to
                  whom has been deputed the office to hear and judge those sins which no subordinate
                  power in the Church is competent to absolve.</p>
               <p>Father Francesco kneels down with a despairing, confiding movement, such as one
                  makes, when, after a long struggle of anguish, one has found a refuge; and the
                  churchman within inclining his ear to the grating, the confession begins.</p>
               <p>Could we only be clairvoyant, it would be worth our while to note the difference
                  between the two faces, separated only by the thin grating of the confessional, but
                  belonging to souls whom an abyss wide as eternity must forever divide from any
                  common ground of understanding.</p>
               <p>On the one side, with ear close to the grate, is a round, smoothly developed
                  Italian head, with that rather tumid outline of features which one often sees in a
                  Roman in middle life, when easy living and habits of sensual indulgence begin to
                  reveal their signs in the countenance, and to broaden and confuse the clear-cut,
                  statuesque lines of early youth. Evidently, that is the head of an easy-going,
                  pleasure-loving man, who has waxed warm with good living, and performs the duties
                  of his office with an unctuous grace as something becoming and decorous to be gone
                  through with. Evidently, he is puzzled and half-contemptuous at the revelations
                  which come through the grating in hoarse whispers from those thin, trembling lips.
                  The other man, who speaks with the sweat of anguish beaded on his brow, with a
                  mortal pallor on his thin, worn cheeks, is putting questions to the celestial
                  guide within which seem to that guide the ravings of a crazed lunatic; and yet
                  there is a deadly, despairing earnestness in the appeal that makes an indistinct
                  knocking at the door of his heart, for the man is born of woman, and can feel that
                  somehow or other these are the words of a mighty agony.</p>
               <p>He addresses him some words of commonplace ghostly comfort, and gives a plenary
                  absolution. The Capuchin monk rises up and stands meekly wiping the sweat from his
                  brow, the churchman leaves his box, and they meet face to face, when each starts,
                  seeing in the other the apparition of a once well-known countenance.</p>
               <p>"What! Lorenzo Sforza!" said the churchman. "Who would have thought it? Don't you
                  remember me?"</p>
               <p>"Not Lorenzo Sforza," said the other, a hectic brilliancy flushing his pale cheek;
                  "that name is buried in the tomb of his fathers; he you speak to knows it no more.
                  The unworthy Brother Francesco, deserving nothing of God or man, is before
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Oh, come, come!" said the other, grasping his hand in spite of his resistance;
                  "that is all proper enough in its place; but between friends, you know, what's the
                  use? It's lucky we have you here now; we want one of your family to send on a
                  mission to Florence, and talk a little reason into the citizens and the Signoria.
                  Come right away with me to the Pope."</p>
               <p>"Brother, in God's name let me go! I have no mission to the great of this world;
                  and I cannot remember or be called by the name of other days, or salute kinsman or
                  acquaintance after the flesh, without a breach of vows."</p>
               <pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7945-00000184"/>
               <p>"Poh, poh! you are nervous, dyspeptic; you don't understand things. Don't you see
                  you are where vows can be bound and loosed? Come along, and let us wake you out of
                  this nightmare. Such a pother about a pretty peasant-girl! One of your rank and
                  taste, too! I warrant me the little sinner practised on you at the confessional. I
                  know their ways, the whole of them; but you mourn over it in a way that is
                  perfectly incomprehensible. If you had tripped a little,—paid a compliment, or
                  taken a liberty or two,—it would have been only natural; but this desperation,
                  when you have resisted like Saint Anthony himself, shows your nerves are out of
                  order and you need change."</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, brother, tempt me not!" said Father Francesco, wrenching himself
                  away, with such a haggard and insane vehemence as quite to discompose the
                  churchman; and drawing his cowl over his face, he glided swiftly down a side-aisle
                  and out the door.</p>
               <p>The churchman was too easy-going to risk the fatigue of a scuffle with a man whom
                  he considered as a monomaniac; but he stepped smoothly and stealthily after him
                  and watched him go out.</p>
               <p>"Look you," he said to a servant in violet livery who was waiting by the door,
                  "follow yonder Capuchin and bring me word where he abides.—He may be cracked," he
                  said to himself; "but, after all, one of his blood may be worth mending, and do us
                  good service either in Florence or Milan. We must have him transferred to some
                  convent here, where we can lay hands on him readily, if we want him."</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Father Francesco wends his way through many a dark and dingy street to
                  an ancient Capuchin convent, where he finds brotherly admission. Weary and
                  despairing spairing is he beyond all earthly despair, for the very altar of his
                  God seems to have failed him. He asked for bread, and has got a stone,—he asked a
                  fish, and has got a scorpion. Again and again the worldly, almost scoffing, tone
                  of the superior to whom he has been confessing sounds like the hiss of a serpent
                  in his ear.</p>
               <p>But he is sent for in haste to visit the bedside of the Prior, who has long been
                  sick and failing, and who gladly embraces this opportunity to make his last
                  confession to a man of such reputed sanctity in his order as Father Francesco. For
                  the acute Father Johannes, casting about for various means to empty the Superior's
                  chair at Sorrento, for his own benefit, and despairing of any occasion of
                  slanderous accusation, had taken the other tack of writing to Rome extravagant
                  laudations of such feats of penance and saintship in his Superior as in the view
                  of all the brothers required that such a light should no more be hidden in an
                  obscure province, but be set on a Roman candlestick, where it might give light to
                  the faithful in all parts of the world. Thus two currents of worldly intrigue were
                  uniting to push an unworldly man to a higher dignity than he either sought or
                  desired.</p>
               <p>When a man has a sensitive or sore spot in his heart, from the pain of which he
                  would gladly flee to the ends of the earth, it is marvellous what coincidences of
                  events will be found to press upon it wherever he may go. Singularly enough, one
                  of the first items in the confession of the Capuchin Superior related to Agnes,
                  and his story was in substance as follows. In his youth he had been induced by the
                  persuasions of the young son of a great and powerful family to unite him in the
                  holy sacrament of marriage with a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">protégée</foreign> of
                  his mother's; but the marriage being detected,<pb n="368-369"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000185"/> it was disavowed by the young nobleman, and the
                  girl and her mother chased out ignominiously, so that she died in great misery.
                  For his complicity in this sin the conscience of the monk had often troubled him,
                  and he had kept track of the child she left, thinking perhaps some day to make
                  reparation by declaring the true marriage of her mother. That the residence of
                  this young girl had been at Sorrento, where she had been living quite retired,
                  under the charge of her old grandmother,—and here the dying man made inquiry if
                  Father Francesco was acquainted with any young person answering to the description
                  which he gave.</p>
               <p>Father Francesco had no difficulty in recognizing the person,—and assured the
                  dying penitent, that, in all human probability, she was at this moment in Rome.
                  The monk then certified upon the holy cross to the true marriage of her mother,
                  and besought Father Francesco to make the same known to one of her kindred whom he
                  named. He further informed him, that this family, having fallen under the
                  displeasure of the Pope and his son, Cæsar Borgia, had been banished from the
                  city, and their property confiscated, so that there was none of them to be found
                  thereabouts except an aged widowed sister of the young man, who, having married
                  into a family in favor with the Pope, was allowed to retain her possessions, and
                  now resided in a villa near Rome, where she lived retired, devoting her whole life
                  to works of piety. The old man therefore conjured Father Francesco to lose no time
                  in making this religious lady understand the existence of so near a kinswoman, and
                  take her under her protection.—Thus strangely did Father Francesco find himself
                  again obliged to take up that enchanted thread which had led him into labyrinths
                  so fatal to his peace.</p>

               <p>AGNES entered the city of Rome in a trance of enthusiastic emotion, almost such as
                  one might imagine in a soul entering the heavenly Jerusalem above. To her exalted
                  ideas she was approaching not only the ground hallowed by the blood of apostles
                  and martyrs, not merely the tombs of the faithful, but the visible "general
                  assembly and church of the first-born which are written in heaven." Here reigned
                  the appointed representative of Jesus,—and she imagined a benignant image of a
                  prince clothed with honor and splendor, who was yet the righter of all wrongs, the
                  redresser of all injuries, the friend and succorer of the poor and needy; and she
                  was firm in a secret purpose to go to this great and benignant father, and on her
                  knees entreat him to forgive the sins of her lover, and remove the excommunication
                  that threatened at every moment his eternal salvation. For she trembled to think
                  of it,—a sudden accident, a thrust of a dagger, a fall from his horse, might put
                  him forever beyond the pale of repentance,—he might die unforgiven, and sink to
                  eternal pain.</p>
               <p>If any should wonder that a Christian soul could preserve within itself an image
                  so ignorantly fair, in such an age, when the worldliness and corruption in the
                  Papal chair were obtruded by a thousand incidental manifestations, and were
                  alluded to in all the calculations of simple common people, who looked at facts
                  with a mere view to the guidance of<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7945-00000186"/>
                  their daily conduct, it is necessary to remember the nature of Agnes's religious
                  training, and the absolute renunciation of all individual reasoning which from
                  infancy had been laid down before her as the first and indispensable prerequisite
                  of spiritual progress. To believe,—to believe utterly and blindly,—not only
                  without evidence, but against evidence,—to reject the testimony even of her
                  senses, when set against the simple affirmation of her superiors,—had been the
                  beginning, middle, and end of her religious instruction. When a doubt assailed her
                  mind on any point, she had been taught to retire within herself and repeat a
                  prayer; and in this way her mental eye had formed the habit of closing to anything
                  that might shake her faith as quickly as the physical eye closes at a threatened
                  blow. Then, as she was of a poetic and ideal nature, entirely differing from the
                  mass of those with whom she associated, she had formed that habit of abstraction
                  and mental revery which prevented her hearing or perceiving the true sense of a
                  great deal that went on around her. The conversations that commonly were carried
                  on in her presence had for her so little interest that she scarcely heard them.
                  The world in which she moved was a glorified world,—wherein, to be sure, the forms
                  of everyday life appeared, but appeared as different from what they were in
                  reality as the old mouldering daylight view of Rome is from the warm translucent
                  glory of its evening transfiguration.</p>
               <p>So in her quiet, silent heart she nursed this beautiful hope of finding in Rome
                  the earthly image of her Saviour's home above, of finding in the head of the
                  Church the real image of her Redeemer,—the friend to whom the poorest and lowliest
                  may pour out their souls with as much freedom as the highest and noblest. The
                  spiritual directors who had formed the mind of Agnes in her early days had been
                  persons in the same manner taught to move in an ideal world of faith. The Mother
                  Theresa had never seen the realities of life, and supposed the Church on earth to
                  be all that the fondest visions of human longing could paint it. The hard,
                  energetic, prose experience of old Jocunda, and the downright way with which she
                  sometimes spoke of things as a trooper's wife must have seen them, were repressed
                  and hushed down, as the imperfect faith of a half-reclaimed worldling,—they could
                  not be allowed to awaken her from the sweetness of so blissful a dream. In like
                  manner, when Lorenzo Sforza became Father Francesco, he strove with earnest prayer
                  to bury his gift of individual reason in the same grave with his family name and
                  worldly experience. As to all that transpired in the real world, he wrapped
                  himself in a mantle of imperturbable silence; the intrigues of popes and
                  cardinals, once well known to him, sank away as a forbidden dream; and by some
                  metaphysical process of imaginative devotion, he enthroned God in the place of the
                  dominant powers, and taught himself to receive all that came from them in
                  uninquiring submission, as proceeding from unerring wisdom. Though he had begun
                  his spiritual life under the impulse of Savonarola, yet so perfect had been his
                  isolation from all tidings of what transpired in the external world that the
                  conflict which was going on between that distinguished man and the Papal hierarchy
                  never reached his ear. He sought and aimed as much as possible to make his soul
                  like the soul of one dead, which adores and worships in ideal space, and forgets
                  forever the scenes and relations of earth; and he had so long contemplated Rome
                  under the celestial aspects of his faith, that, though the shock of his first
                  confession there had been painful, still it<pb n="372-373"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000187"/> was insufficient to shake his faith. It had been
                  God's will, he thought, that where he looked for aid he should meet only
                  confusion, and he bowed to the inscrutable will, and blindly adored the mysterious
                  revelation. If such could be the submission and the faith of a strong and
                  experienced man, who can wonder at the enthusiastic illusions of an innocent,
                  trustful child?</p>
               <p>Agnes and her grandmother entered the city of Rome just as the twilight had faded
                  into night; and though Agnes, full of faith and enthusiasm, was longing to begin
                  immediately the ecstatic vision of shrines and holy places, old Elsie commanded
                  her not to think of anything further that night. They proceeded, therefore, with
                  several other pilgrims who had entered the city, to a church specially set apart
                  for their reception, connected with which were large dormitories and a religious
                  order whose business was to receive and wait upon them, and to see that all their
                  wants were supplied. This religious foundation is one of the oldest in Rome; and
                  it is esteemed a work of especial merit and sanctity among the citizens to
                  associate themselves temporarily in these labors in Holy Week. Even princes and
                  princesses come, humble and lowly, mingling with those of common degree, and all,
                  calling each other brother and sister, vie in kind attentions to these guests of
                  the Church.</p>
               <p>When Agnes and Elsie arrived, several of these volunteer assistants were in
                  waiting. Agnes was remarked among all the rest of the company for her peculiar
                  beauty and the rapt enthusiastic expression of her face.</p>
               <p>Almost immediately on their entrance into the reception-hall connected with the
                  church, they seemed to attract the attention of a tall lady dressed in deep
                  mourning, and accompanied by a female servant, with whom she was conversing on
                  those terms of intimacy which showed confidential relations between the two.</p>
               <p>"See!" she said, "my Mona, what a heavenly face is there!—that sweet child has
                  certainly the light of grace shining through her. My heart warms to her."</p>
               <p>"Indeed," said the old servant, looking across, "and well it may,—dear lamb come
                  so far! But, Holy Virgin, how my head swims! How strange!—that child reminds me of
                  some one. My Lady, perhaps, may think of some one whom she looks like."</p>
               <p>"Mona, you say true. I have the same strange impression that I have seen a face
                  like hers, but who or where I cannot say."</p>
               <p>"What would my Lady say, if I said it was our dear Prince?—God rest his soul!"</p>
               <p>"Mona, it <emph>is</emph> so,—yes," added the lady, looking more intently,—"how
                  singular!—the very traits of our house in a peasant-girl! She is of Sorrento, I
                  judge, by her costume,—what a pretty one it is! That old woman is her mother,
                  perhaps. I must choose her for my care,—and, Mona, you shall wait on her
                  mother."</p>
               <p>So saying, the Princess Paulina crossed the hall, and, bending affably over Agnes,
                  took her hand and kissed her, saying,—</p>
               <p>"Welcome, my dear little sister, to the house of our Father!"</p>
               <p>Agnes looked up with strange, wondering eyes into the face that was bent to hers.
                  It was sallow and sunken, with deep lines of ill-health and sorrow, but the
                  features were noble, and must once have been beautiful; the whole action, voice,
                  and manner were dignified and impressive. Instinctively she felt that the lady was
                  of superior birth and<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC7945-00000188"/> breeding to any
                  with whom she had been in the habit of associating.</p>
               <p>"Come with me," said the lady; "and this—your mother"—she added.</p>
               <p>"She is my grandmother," said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, your grandmother, sweet child, shall be attended to by my good sister
                  Mona here."</p>
               <p>The Princess Paulina drew the hand of Agnes through her arm, and, laying her hand
                  affectionately on it, looked down and smiled tenderly on her.</p>
               <p>"Are you very tired, my dear?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! no!" said Agnes,—"I am so happy, so blessed to be here!"</p>
               <p>"You have travelled a long way?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, from Sorrento; but I am used to walking,—I did not feel it to be long,—my
                  heart kept me up,—I wanted to come home so much."</p>
               <p>"Home?" said the Princess.</p>
               <p>"Yes, to my soul's home,—the house of our dear Father the Pope."</p>
               <p>The Princess started, and looked incredulously down for a moment; then noticing
                  the confiding, whole-hearted air of the child, she sighed and was silent.</p>
               <p>"Come with me above," she said, "and let me attend a little to your comfort."</p>
               <p>"How good you are, dear lady!" said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"I am not good, my child,—I am only your unworthy sister in Christ;" and as the
                  lady spoke, she opened the door into a room where were a number of other female
                  pilgrims seated around the wall, each attended by a person whose peculiar care she
                  seemed to be.</p>
               <p>At the feet of each was a vessel of water, and when the seats were all full, a
                  cardinal in robes of office entered, and began reading prayers. Each lady present,
                  kneeling at the feet of her chosen pilgrim, divested them carefully of their worn
                  and travel-soiled shoes and stockings, and proceeded to wash them. It was not a
                  mere rose-water ceremony, but a good hearty washing of feet that for the most part
                  had great need of the ablution. While this service was going on, the cardinal read
                  from the Gospel how a Greater than they all had washed the feet of His disciples,
                  and said, "If I, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to
                  wash one another's feet." Then all repeated in concert the Lord's Prayer, while
                  each humbly kissed the feet she had washed, and proceeded to replace the worn and
                  travel-soiled shoes and stockings with new and strong ones, the gift of Christian
                  love. Each lady then led her charge into a room where tables were spread with a
                  plain and wholesome repast of all such articles of food as the season of Lent
                  allowed. Each placed her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">protégée</foreign> at table, and
                  carefully attended to all her wants at the supper, and afterwards dormitories were
                  opened for their repose.</p>
               <p>The Princess Paulina performed all these offices for Agnes with a tender
                  earnestness which won upon her heart. The young girl thought herself indeed in
                  that blessed society of which she had dreamed, where the high-born and the rich
                  become through Christ's love the servants of the poor and lowly,—and through all
                  the services she sat in a sort of dream of rapture. How lovely this reception into
                  the Holy City! how sweet thus to be taken to the arms of the great Christian
                  family, bound together in the charity which is the bond of perfectness!</p>
               <p>"Please tell me, dear lady," said Agnes, after supper, "who is that holy man that
                  prayed with us?"</p>
               <pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC7945-00000189"/>
               <p>"Oh, he—he is the Cardinal Capello," said the Princess.</p>
               <p>"I should like to have spoken with him," said Agnes.</p>
               <p>"Why, my child?"</p>
               <p>"I wanted to ask him when and how I could get speech with our dear Father the
                  Pope,—for there is somewhat on my mind that I would lay before him."</p>
               <p>"My poor little sister," said the Princess, much perplexed, "you do not understand
                  things. What you speak of is impossible. The Pope is a great king."</p>
               <p>"I know he is," said Agnes,—"and so is our Lord Jesus,—but every soul may come to
                  him."</p>
               <p>"I cannot explain to you now," said the Princess,—"there is not time to-night. But
                  I shall see you again. I will send for you to come to my house, and there talk
                  with you about many things which you need to know. Meanwhile, promise me, dear
                  child, not to try to do anything of the kind you spoke of until I have talked with
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Well, I will not," said Agnes, with a glance of docile affection, kissing the
                  hand of the Princess.</p>
               <p>The action was so pretty,—the great, soft, dark eyes looked so fawn-like and
                  confiding in their innocent tenderness, that the lady seemed much moved.</p>
               <p>"Our dear Mother bless thee, child!" she said, laying her hand on her head, and
                  stooping to kiss her forehead.</p>
               <p>She left her at the door of the dormitory.</p>
               <p>The Princess and her attendant went out of the church-door, where her litter stood
                  in waiting. The two took their seats in silence, and silently pursued their way
                  through the streets of the old dimly-lighted city and out of one of its principal
                  gates to the wide Campagna beyond. The villa of the Princess was situated on an
                  eminence at some distance from the city, and the night-ride to it was solemn and
                  solitary. They passed along the old Appian Way over pavements that had rumbled
                  under the chariot-wheels of the emperors and nobles of a by-gone age, while along
                  their way, glooming up against the clear of the sky, were vast shadowy piles,—the
                  tombs of the dead of other days. All mouldering and lonely, shaggy and fringed
                  with bushes and streaming wild vines through which the night-wind sighed and
                  rustled, they might seem to be pervaded by the restless spirits of the dead; and
                  as the lady passed them, she shivered, and, crossing herself, repeated an inward
                  prayer against wandering demons that walk in desolate places.</p>
               <p>Timid and solitary, the high-born lady shrank and cowered within herself with a
                  distressing feeling of loneliness. A childless widow in delicate health, whose
                  paternal family had been for the most part cruelly robbed, exiled, or destroyed by
                  the reigning Pope and his family, she felt her own situation a most unprotected
                  and precarious one, since the least jealousy or misunderstanding might bring upon
                  her, too, the ill-will of the Borgias, which had proved so fatal to the rest of
                  her race. No comfort in life remained to her but her religion, to whose practice
                  she clung as to her all; but even in this her life was embittered by facts to
                  which, with the best disposition in the world, she could not shut her eyes. Her
                  own family had been too near the seat of power not to see all the base intrigues
                  by which that sacred and solemn position of Head of the Christian Church had been
                  traded for as a marketable commodity. The pride, the indecency, the cruelty of
                  those who now reigned in the name of Christ came over her mind in contrast with
                  the picture painted by the artless, trusting faith of the peasant-girl with whom
                  she had just parted. Her mind had been too thoroughly drilled in the
                  non-reflective practice of her faith to<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7945-00000190"/>
                  dare to put forth any act of reasoning upon facts so visible and so
                  tremendous,—she rather trembled at herself for seeing what she saw and for knowing
                  what she knew, and feared somehow that this very knowledge might endanger her
                  salvation; and so she rode homeward cowering and praying like a frightened
                  child.</p>
               <p>"Does my Lady feel ill?" said the old servant, anxiously.</p>
               <p>"No, Mona, no,—not in body."</p>
               <p>"And what is on my Lady's mind now?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mona, it is only what is always there. To-morrow is Palm Sunday, and how can
                  I go to see the murderers and robbers of our house in holy places? Oh, Mona, what
                  can Christians do, when such men handle holy things? It was a comfort to wash the
                  feet of those poor simple pilgrims, who tread in the steps of the saints of old;
                  but how I felt when that poor child spoke of wanting to see the Pope!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Mona, "it's like sending the lamb to get spiritual counsel of the
                  wolf."</p>
               <p>"See what sweet belief the poor infant has! Should not the head of the Christian
                  Church be such as she thinks? Ah, in the old days, when the Church here in Rome
                  was poor and persecuted, there were popes who were loving fathers and not haughty
                  princes."</p>
               <p>"My dear Lady," said the servant, "pray, consider, the very stones have ears. We
                  don't know what day we may be turned out, neck and heels, to make room for some of
                  their creatures."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mona," said the lady, with some spirit, "I'm sure I have n't said any more
                  than you have."</p>
               <p>"Holy Mother! and so you have n't, but somehow things look more dangerous when
                  other people say them.—A pretty child that was, as you say; but that old thing,
                  her grandmother, is a sharp piece. She is a Roman, and lived here in her early
                  days. She says the little one was born hereabouts; but she shuts up her mouth like
                  a vice, when one would get more out of her."</p>
               <p>"Mona, I shall not go out to-morrow; but you go to the services, and find the girl
                  and her grandmother, and bring them out to me. I want to counsel the child."</p>
               <p>"You may be sure," said Mona, "that her grandmother knows the ins and outs of Rome
                  as well as any of us, for all she has learned to screw up her lips so tight."</p>
               <p>"At any rate, bring her to me, because she interests me."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, it shall be so," said Mona.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">PALM SUNDAY.</head>
               <p>THE morning after her arrival in Rome, Agnes was awakened from sleep by a solemn
                  dropping of bell-tones which seemed to fill the whole air, intermingled dimly at
                  intervals with long-drawn plaintive sounds of chanting. She had slept profoundly,
                  overwearied with her pilgrimage, and soothed by that deep lulling sense of quiet
                  which comes over one, when, after long and weary toils, some auspicious goal is at
                  length reached. She had come to Rome, and been received with open arms into the
                  household of the saints, and seen even those of highest degree imitating the
                  simplicity of the Lord in serving the poor. Surely, this was indeed the house of
                  God and the gate of heaven; and so the bell-tones and chants, mingling with her
                  dreams, seemed naturally enough angel-harpings and distant echoes of the perpetual
                  adoration of the blessed. She rose and dressed herself with a tremulous joy. She
                  felt full of hope that somehow—in what way she could not say—this auspicious
                  beginning would end in a full fruition of all her wishes, an answer to all her
                  prayers.</p>
               <p>"Well, child," said old Elsie, "you must have slept well; you look fresh as a
                  lark."</p>
               <p>"The air of this holy place revives me," said Agnes, with enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>"I wish I could say as much," said Elsie. "My bones ache yet with the tramp, and I
                  suppose nothing will do but we must go out now to all the holy places, up and down
                  and hither and yon, to everything that goes on. I saw enough of it all years ago
                  when I lived here."</p>
               <p>"Dear grandmother, if you are tired, why should you not rest? I can go forth alone
                  in this holy city. No harm can possibly befall me here. I can join any of the
                  pilgrims who are going to the holy places where I long to worship."</p>
               <p>"A likely story!" said Elsie. "I know more about old Rome than you do, and I tell
                  you, child, that you do not stir out a step without me; so if you must go, I must
                  go too,—and like enough it's for my soul's health. I suppose it is," she added,
                  after a reflective pause.</p>
               <p>"How beautiful it was that we were welcomed so last night!" said Agnes,—"that dear
                  lady was so kind to me!"</p>
               <p>"Ay, ay, and well she might be!" said Elsie, nodding her head. "But there's no
                  truth in the kindness of the nobles to us, child. They don't do it because they
                  love us, but because they expect to buy heaven by washing our feet and giving us
                  what little they can clip and snip off from their abundance."</p>
               <p>"Oh, grandmother," said Agnes, "how can you say so? Certainly, if any one ever
                  spoke and looked lovingly, it was that dear lady."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and she rolls away in her carriage, well content, and leaves you with a pair
                  of new shoes and stockings,—you, as worthy of a carriage and a palace as she."</p>
               <p>"No, grandmamma; she said she should send for me to talk more with her."</p>
               <p>"<emph>She</emph> said she should send for you?" said Elsie. "Well,<pb n="382-383"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000192"/> well, that is strange, to be sure!—that is
                  wonderful!" she added, reflectively. "But come, child, we must hasten through our
                  breakfast and prayers, and go to see the Pope, and all the great birds with fine
                  feathers that fly after him."</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed!" said Agnes, joyfully. "Oh, grandmamma, what a blessed sight it will
                  be!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, child, and a fine sight enough he makes with his great canopy and his plumes
                  and his servants and his trumpeters;—there is n't a king in Christendom that goes
                  so proudly as he."</p>
               <p>"No other king is worthy of it," said Agnes. "The Lord reigns in him."</p>
               <p>"Much you know about it!" said Elsie, between her teeth, as they started out.</p>
               <p>The streets of Rome through which they walked were damp and cellar-like, filthy
                  and ill-paved; but Agnes neither saw nor felt anything of inconvenience in this:
                  had they been floored, like those of the New Jerusalem, with translucent gold, her
                  faith could not have been more fervent.</p>
               <p>Rome is at all times a forest of quaint costumes, a pantomime of shifting scenic
                  effects of religious ceremonies. Nothing there, however singular, strikes the eye
                  as out-of-the-way or unexpected, since no one knows precisely to what religious
                  order it may belong, or what individual vow or purpose it may represent. Neither
                  Agnes nor Elsie, therefore, was surprised, when they passed through the door-way
                  to the street, at the apparition of a man covered from head to foot in a long robe
                  of white serge, with a high-peaked cap of the same material drawn completely down
                  over his head and face. Two round holes cut in this ghostly head-gear revealed
                  simply two black glittering eyes, which shone with that singular elfish effect
                  which belongs to the human eye when removed from its appropriate and natural
                  accessories. As they passed out, the figure rattled a box on which was painted an
                  image of despairing souls raising imploring hands from very red tongues of flame,
                  by which it was understood at once that he sought aid for souls in Purgatory.
                  Agnes and her grandmother each dropped therein a small coin and went on their way;
                  but the figure followed them at a little distance behind, keeping carefully within
                  sight of them.</p>
               <p>By means of energetic pushing and striving, Elsie contrived to secure for herself
                  and her grandchild stations in the piazza in front of the church, in the very
                  front rank, where the procession was to pass. A motley assemblage it was, this
                  crowd, comprising every variety of costume of rank and station and ecclesiastical
                  profession,—cowls and hoods of Franciscan and Dominican,—picturesque head-dresses
                  of peasant-women of different districts,—plumes and ruffs of more aspiring
                  gentility,—mixed with every quaint phase of foreign costume belonging to the
                  strangers from different parts of the earth;—for, like the old Jewish Passover,
                  this celebration of Holy Week had its assemblage of Parthians, Medes, Elamites,
                  dwellers in Mesopotamia, Cretes, and Arabians, all blending in one common
                  memorial.</p>
               <p>Amid the strange variety of persons among whom they were crowded, Elsie remarked
                  the stranger in the white sack, who had followed them, and who had stationed
                  himself behind them,—but it did not occur to her that his presence there was other
                  than merely accidental.</p>
               <p>And now came sweeping up the grand procession, brilliant with scarlet and gold,
                  waving with plumes, sparkling with gems,—it seemed as if earth had been ransacked
                  and human<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC7945-00000193"/> man invention taxed to
                  express the ultimatum of all that could dazzle and bewilder,—and, with a rustle
                  like that of ripe grain before a swaying wind, all the multitude went down on
                  their knees as the cortege passed. Agnes knelt, too, with clasped hands, adoring
                  the sacred vision enshrined in her soul; and as she knelt with upraised eyes, her
                  cheeks flushed with enthusiasm, her beauty attracted the attention of more than
                  one in the procession.</p>
               <p>"There is the model which our master has been looking for," said a young and
                  handsome man in a rich dress of black velvet, who, by his costume, appeared to
                  hold the rank of first chamberlain in the Papal suite.</p>
               <p>The young man to whom he spoke gave a bold glance at Agnes and answered,—</p>
               <p>"Pretty little rogue, how well she does the saint!"</p>
               <p>"One can see, that, with judicious arrangement, she might make a nymph as well as
                  a saint," said the first speaker.</p>
               <p>"A Daphne, for example," said the other, laughing.</p>
               <p>"And she would n't turn into a laurel, either," said the first. "Well, we must
                  keep our eye on her." And as they were passing into the church-door, he beckoned
                  to a servant in waiting and whispered something, indicating Agnes with a backward
                  movement of his hand.</p>
               <p>The servant, after this, kept cautiously within observing distance of her, as she
                  with the crowd pressed into the church to assist at the devotions.</p>
               <p>Long and dazzling were those ceremonies, when, raised on high like an enthroned
                  God, Pope Alexander VI. received the homage of bended knee from the ambassadors of
                  every Christian nation, from heads of all ecclesiastical orders, and from generals
                  and chiefs and princes and nobles, who, robed and plumed and gemmed in all the
                  brightest and proudest that earth could give, bowed the knee humbly and kissed his
                  foot in return for the palm-branch which he presented. Meanwhile, voices of
                  invisible singers chanted the simple event which all this splendor was
                  commemorating,—how of old Jesus came into Jerusalem meek and lowly, riding on an
                  ass,—how His disciples cast their garments in the way, and the multitude took
                  branches of palm-trees to come forth and meet Him,—how He was seized, tried,
                  condemned to a cruel death,—and the crowd, with dazzled and wondering eyes
                  following the gorgeous ceremonial, reflected little how great was the satire of
                  the contrast, how different the coming of that meek and lowly One to suffer and to
                  die from this triumphant display of worldly pomp and splendor in His professed
                  representative.</p>
               <p>But to the pure all things are pure, and Agnes thought only of the enthronement of
                  all virtues, of all celestial charities and unworldly purities in that splendid
                  ceremonial, and longed within herself to approach so near as to touch the hem of
                  those wondrous and sacred garments. It was to her enthusiastic imagination like
                  the unclosing of celestial doors, where the kings and priests of an eternal and
                  heavenly temple move to and fro in music, with the many-colored glories of
                  rainbows and sunset clouds. Her whole nature was wrought upon by the sights and
                  sounds of that gorgeous worship,—she seemed to burn and brighten like an
                  altar-coal, her figure appeared to dilate, her eyes grew deeper and shone with a
                  starry light, and the color of her cheeks flushed up with a vivid glow,—nor was
                  she aware how often eyes were turned upon her, nor how murmurs of admiration
                  followed all her absorbed, unconscious movements. "<foreign xml:lang="ITA">Ecco!
                     Eccola!</foreign>" was often repeated from mouth to mouth around her, but she
                  heard it not.</p>
               <pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC7945-00000194"/>
               <p>When at last the ceremony was finished, the crowd rushed again out of the church
                  to see the departure of various dignitaries. There was a perfect whirl of dazzling
                  equipages, and glittering lackeys, and prancing horses, crusted with gold, flaming
                  in scarlet and purple, retinues of cardinals and princes and nobles and
                  ambassadors all in one splendid confused jostle of noise and brightness.</p>
               <p>Suddenly a servant in a gorgeous scarlet livery touched Agnes on the shoulder, and
                  said, in a tone of authority,—</p>
               <p>"Young maiden, your presence is commanded."</p>
               <p>"Who commands it?" said Elsie, laying her hand on her grandchild's shoulder
                  fiercely.</p>
               <p>"Are you mad?" whispered two or three women of the lower orders to Elsie at once;
                  "don't you know who that is? Hush, for your life!"</p>
               <p>"I shall go with you, Agnes," said Elsie, resolutely.</p>
               <p>"No, you will not," said the attendant, insolently. "This maiden is commanded, and
                  none else."</p>
               <p>"He belongs to the Pope's nephew," whispered a voice in Elsie's ear. "You had
                  better have your tongue torn out than say another word." Whereupon, Elsie found
                  herself actually borne backward by three or four stout women.</p>
               <p>Agnes looked round and smiled on her,—a smile full of innocent trust,—and then,
                  turning, followed the servant into the finest of the equipages, where she was lost
                  to view.</p>
               <p>Elsie was almost wild with fear and impotent rage; but a low, impressive voice now
                  spoke in her ear. It came from the white figure which had followed them in the
                  morning.</p>
               <p>"Listen," it said, "and be quiet; don't turn your head, but hear what I tell you.
                  Your child is followed by those who will save her. Go your ways whence you came.
                  Wait till the hour after the Ave Maria, then come to the Porta San Sebastiano, and
                  all will be well."</p>
               <p>When Elsie turned to look she saw no one, but caught a distant glimpse of a white
                  figure vanishing in the crowd.</p>
               <p>She returned to her asylum, wondering and disconsolate, and the first person whom
                  she saw was old Mona.</p>
               <p>"Well, good-morrow, sister!" she said. "Know that I am here on a strange errand.
                  The Princess has taken such a liking to you that nothing will do but we must fetch
                  you and your little one out to her villa. I looked everywhere for you in church
                  this morning. Where have you hid yourselves?"</p>
               <p>"We were there," said Elsie, confused, and hesitating whether to speak of what had
                  happened.</p>
               <p>"Well, where is the little one? Get her ready; we have horses in waiting. It is a
                  good bit out of the city."</p>
               <p>"Alack!" said Elsie, "I know not where she is."</p>
               <p>"Holy Virgin!" said Mona, "how is this?"</p>
               <p>Elsie, moved by the necessity which makes it a relief to open the heart to some
                  one, sat down on the steps of the church and poured forth the whole story into the
                  listening ear of Mona.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, well!" said the old servant, "in our days, one does not wonder at
                  anything,—one never knows one day what may come the next,—but this is bad
                  enough!"</p>
               <p>"Do you think," said Elsie, "there is any hope in that strange promise?"</p>
               <p>"One can but try it," said Mona.</p>
               <p>"If you could but be there then," said Elsie, "and take us to your mistress."</p>
               <pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7945-00000195"/>
               <p>"Well, I will wait, for my mistress has taken an especial fancy to your little
                  one, more particularly since this morning, when a holy Capuchin came to our house
                  and held a long conference with her, and after he was gone I found my lady almost
                  in a faint, and she would have it that we should start directly to bring her out
                  here, and I had much ado to let her see that the child would do quite as well
                  after services were over. I tired myself looking about for you in the crowd."</p>
               <p>The two women then digressed upon various gossiping particulars, as they sat on
                  the old mossy, grass-grown steps, looking up over house-tops yellow with lichen,
                  into the blue spring air, where flocks of white pigeons were soaring and careering
                  in the soft, warm sunshine. Brightness and warmth and flowers seemed to be the
                  only idea natural to that charming weather, and Elsie, sad-hearted and foreboding
                  as she was, felt the benign influence. Rome, which had been so fatal a place to
                  her peace, yet had for her, as it has for every one, potent spells of a lulling
                  and soothing power. Where is the grief or anxiety that can resist the enchantment
                  of one of Rome's bright, soft, spring days?</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE NIGHT-RIDE.</head>
               <p>THE villa of the Princess Paulina was one of those soft, idyllic paradises which
                  lie like so many fairy-lands around the dreamy solitudes of Rome. They are so
                  fair, so wild, so still, these villas! Nature in them seems to run in such gentle
                  sympathy with Art, that one feels as if they had not been so much the product of
                  human skill as some indigenous growth of Arcadian ages. There are quaint terraces
                  shadowed by clipped ilex-trees, whose branches make twilight even in the sultriest
                  noon; there are long-drawn paths, through wildernesses where cyclamens blossom in
                  crimson clouds among crushed fragments of sculptured marble green with the moss of
                  ages, and glossy-leaved myrtles put forth their pale blue stars in constellations
                  under the leafy shadows. Everywhere is the voice of water, ever lulling, ever
                  babbling, and taught by Art to run in many a quaint caprice,—here to rush down
                  marble steps slippery with sedgy green, there to spout up in silvery spray, and
                  anon to spread into a cool, waveless lake, whose mirror reflects trees and flowers
                  far down in some visionary underworld. Then there are wide lawns, where the grass
                  in spring is a perfect rainbow of anemones, white, rose, crimson, purple, mottled,
                  streaked, and dappled with ever varying shade of sunset clouds. There are soft,
                  moist banks where purple and white violets grow large and fair, and trees all
                  interlaced with ivy, which runs and twines everywhere, intermingling its dark,
                     graceful<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC7945-00000196"/> leaves and vivid young
                  shoots with the bloom and leafage of all shadowy places.</p>
               <p>In our day, these lovely places have their dark shadow ever haunting their
                  loveliness: the malaria, like an unseen demon, lies hid in their sweetness. And in
                  the time we are speaking of, a curse not less deadly poisoned the beauties of the
                  Princess's villa,—the malaria of fear.</p>
               <p>The gravelled terrace in front of the villa commanded, through the clipped arches
                  of the ilex-trees, the Campagna with its soft, undulating bands of many-colored
                  green, and the distant city of Rome, whose bells were always filling the air
                  between with a tremulous vibration. Here, during the long sunny afternoon while
                  Elsie and Monica were crooning together on the steps of the church, the Princess
                  Paulina walked restlessly up and down, looking forth on the way towards the city
                  for the travellers whom she expected.</p>
               <p>Father Francesco had been there that morning and communicated to her the dying
                  message of the aged Capuchin, from which it appeared that the child who had so
                  much interested her was her near kinswoman. Perhaps, had her house remained at the
                  height of its power and splendor, she might have rejected with scorn the idea of a
                  kinswoman whose existence had been owing to a <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >mésalliance;</foreign> but a member of an exiled and disinherited family,
                  deriving her only comfort from unworldly sources, she regarded this event as an
                  opportunity afforded her to make expiation for one of the sins of her house. The
                  beauty and winning graces of her young kinswoman were not without their influence
                  in attracting a lonely heart deprived of the support of natural ties. The Princess
                  longed for something to love, and the discovery of a legitimate object of family
                  affection was an event in the weary monotony of her life; and therefore fore it
                  was that the hours of the afternoon seemed long while she looked forth towards
                  Rome, listening to the ceaseless chiming of its bells, and wondering why no one
                  appeared along the road.</p>
               <p>The sun went down, and all the wide plain seemed like the sea at twilight, lying
                  in rosy and lilac and purple shadowy bands, out of which rose the old city, solemn
                  and lonely as some enchanted island of dream-land, with a flush of radiance behind
                  it and a tolling of weird music filling all the air around. Now they are chanting
                  the Ave Maria in hundreds of churches, and the Princess worships in distant
                  accord, and tries to still the anxieties of her heart with many a prayer. Twilight
                  fades and fades, the Campagna becomes a black sea, and the distant city looms up
                  like a dark rock against the glimmering sky, and the Princess goes within and
                  walks restlessly through the wide halls, stopping first at one open window and
                  then at another to listen. Beneath her feet she treads a cool mosaic pavement
                  where laughing Cupids are dancing. Above, from the ceiling, Aurora and the Hours
                  look down in many-colored clouds of brightness. The sound of the fountains without
                  is so clear in the intense stillness that the peculiar voice of each one can be
                  told. That is the swaying noise of the great jet that rises from marble shells and
                  falls into a wide basin, where silvery swans swim round and round in enchanted
                  circles; and the other slenderer sound is the smaller jet that rains down its
                  spray into the violet-borders deep in the shrubbery; and that other, the shallow
                  babble of the waters that go down the marble steps to the lake. How dreamlike and
                  plaintive they all sound in the night stillness! The nightingale sings from the
                  dark shadows of the wilderness; and the musky odors of the cyclamen come floating
                  ever and anon through<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC7945-00000197"/> the casement, in
                  that strange, cloudy way in which flower scents seem to come and go in the air in
                  the night season.</p>
               <p>At last the Princess fancies she hears the distant tramp of horses' feet, and her
                  heart beats so that she can scarcely listen: now she hears it,—and now a rising
                  wind, sweeping across the Campagna, seems to bear it moaning away. She goes to a
                  door and looks out into the darkness. Yes, she hears it now, quick and
                  regular,—the beat of many horses' feet coming in hot haste along the road. Surely
                  the few servants whom she has sent cannot make all this noise! and she trembles
                  with vague affright. Perhaps it is a tyrannical message, bringing imprisonment and
                  death. She calls a maid, and bids her bring lights into the reception-hall. A few
                  moments more, and there is a confused stamping of horses' feet approaching the
                  house, and she hears the voices of her servants. She runs into the piazza, and
                  sees dismounting a knight who carries Agnes in his arms pale and fainting. Old
                  Elsie and Monica, too, dismount, with the Princess's men-servants; but, wonderful
                  to tell, there seems besides them to be a train of some hundred armed
                  horsemen.</p>
               <p>The timid Princess was so fluttered and bewildered that she lost all presence of
                  mind, and stood in uncomprehending wonder, while Monica pushed authoritatively
                  into the house, and beckoned the knight to bring Agnes and lay her on a sofa, when
                  she and old Elsie busied themselves vigorously with restoratives.</p>
               <p>The Lady Paulina, as soon as she could collect her scattered senses, recognized in
                  Agostino the banished lord of the Sarelli family, a race who had shared with her
                  own the hatred and cruelty of the Borgia tribe; and he in turn had recognized a
                  daughter of the Colonnas.</p>
               <p>He drew her aside into a small boudoir adjoining the apartment.</p>
               <p>"Noble lady," he said, "we are companions in misfortune, and so, I trust, you will
                  pardon what seems a tumultuous intrusion on your privacy. I and my men came to
                  Rome in disguise, that we might watch over and protect this poor innocent, who now
                  finds asylum with you."</p>
               <p>"My Lord," said the Princess, "I see in this event the wonderful working of the
                  good God. I have but just learned that this young person is my near kinswoman; it
                  was only this morning that the fact was certified to me on the dying confession of
                  a holy Capuchin, who privately united my brother to her mother. The marriage was
                  an indiscretion of his youth; but afterwards he fell into more grievous sin in
                  denying the holy sacrament, and leaving his wife to die in misery and dishonor,
                  and perhaps for this fault such great judgments fell upon him. I wish to make
                  atonement in such sort as is yet possible by acting as a mother to this
                  child."</p>
               <p>"The times are so troublous and uncertain," said Agostino, "that she must have
                  stronger protection than that of any woman. She is of a most holy and religious
                  nature, but as ignorant of sin as an angel who never has seen anything out of
                  heaven; and so the Borgias enticed her into their impure den, from which, God
                  helping, I have saved her. I tried all I could to prevent her coming to Rome, and
                  to convince her of the vileness that ruled here; but the poor little one could not
                  believe me, and thought me a heretic only for saying what she now knows from her
                  own senses."</p>
               <p>The Lady Paulina shuddered with fear.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible that you have come into collision with the dreadful Borgias? What
                  will become of us?"</p>
               <pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7945-00000198"/>
               <p>"I brought a hundred men into Rome in different disguises," said Agostino, "and we
                  gained over a servant in their household, through whom I entered and carried her
                  off. Their men pursued us, and we had a fight in the streets, but for the moment
                  we mustered more than they. Some of them chased us a good distance. But it will
                  not do for us to remain here. As soon as she is revived enough, we must retreat
                  towards one of our fastnesses in the mountains, whence, when rested, we shall go
                  northward to Florence, where I have powerful friends, and she has also an uncle, a
                  holy man, by whose counsels she is much guided."</p>
               <p>"You must take me with you," said the Princess, in a tremor of anxiety. "Not for
                  the world would I stay, if it be known you have taken refuge here. For a long time
                  their spies have been watching about me; they only wait for some occasion to seize
                  upon my villa, as they have on the possessions of all my father's house. Let me
                  flee with you. I have a brother-in-law in Florence who hath often urged me to
                  escape to him till times mend,—for, surely, God will not allow the wicked to bear
                  rule forever."</p>
               <p>"Willingly, noble lady, will we give you our escort,—the more so that this poor
                  child will then have a friend with her beseeming her father's rank. Believe me,
                  lady, she will do no discredit to her lineage. She was trained in a convent, and
                  her soul is a flower of marvellous beauty. I must declare to you here that I have
                  wooed her honorably to be my wife, and she would willingly be so, had not some
                  scruples of a religious vocation taken hold on her, to dispel which I look for the
                  aid of the holy father, her uncle."</p>
               <p>"It would be a most fit and proper thing," said the Princess, "thus to ally our
                  houses, in hope of some good time to come which shall restore their former
                  standing and possessions sions. Of course some holy man must judge of the obstacle
                  interposed by her vocation; but I doubt not the Church will be an indulgent mother
                  in a case where the issue seems so desirable."</p>
               <p>"If I be married to her," said Agostino, "I can take her out of all these strifes
                  and confusions which now agitate our Italy to the court of France, where I have an
                  uncle high in favor with the King, and who will use all his influence to compose
                  these troubles in Italy, and bring about a better day."</p>
               <p>While this conversation was going on, bountiful refreshments had been provided for
                  the whole party, and the attendants of the Princess received orders to pack all
                  her jewels and valuable effects for a sudden journey.</p>
               <p>As soon as preparations could be made, the whole party left the villa of the
                  Princess for a retreat in the Alban Mountains, where Agostino and his band had one
                  of their rendezvous. Only the immediate female attendants of the Princess, and one
                  or two men-servants, left with her. The silver plate, and all objects of
                  particular value, were buried in the garden. This being done, the keys of the
                  house were intrusted to a gray-headed servant, who with his wife had grown old in
                  the family.</p>
               <p>It was midnight before everything was ready for starting. The moon cast silver
                  gleams through the ilex-avenues, and caused the jet of the great fountain to look
                  like a wavering pillar of cloudy brightness, when the Princess led forth Agnes
                  upon the wide veranda. Two gentle, yet spirited little animals from the Princess's
                  stables were there awaiting them, and they were lifted into their saddles by
                  Agostino.</p>
               <p>"Fear nothing, Madam," he said, observing how the<pb n="396-397"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000199"/> hands of the Princess trembled; "a few hours will
                  put us in perfect safety, and I shall be at your side constantly."</p>
               <p>Then lifting Agnes to her seat, he placed the reins in her hand.</p>
               <p>"Are you rested?" he asked.</p>
               <p>It was the first time since her rescue that he had spoken to Agnes. The words were
                  brief, but no expressions of endearment could convey more than the manner in which
                  they were spoken.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my Lord," said Agnes firmly, "I am rested."</p>
               <p>"You think you can bear the ride?"</p>
               <p>"I can bear anything, so I escape," she said.</p>
               <p>The company were now all mounted, and were marshalled in regular order. A body of
                  armed men rode in front; then came Agnes and the Princess, with Agostino between
                  them, while two or three troopers rode on either side; Elsie, Monica, and the
                  servants of the Princess followed close behind, and the rear was brought up in
                  like manner by armed men.</p>
               <p>The path wound first through the grounds of the villa, with its plats of light and
                  shade, its solemn groves of stone-pines rising like palm-trees high in air above
                  the tops of all other trees, its terraces and statues and fountains,—all seeming
                  so lovely in the midnight stillness.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I am leaving all this forever," said the Princess.</p>
               <p>"Let us hope for the best," said Agostino. "It cannot be that God will suffer the
                  seat of the Apostles to be subjected to such ignominy and disgrace much longer. I
                  am amazed that no Christian kings have interfered before for the honor of
                  Christendom. I have it from the best authority that the King of Naples burst into
                  tears when he heard of the election of this wretch to be Pope. He said that it was
                  a scandal which threatened the very existence of Christianity. He has sent me
                  secret messages divers times expressive of sympathy, but he is not of himself
                  strong enough. Our hope must lie either in the King of France or the Emperor of
                  Germany: perhaps both will engage. There is now a most holy monk in Florence who
                  has been stirring all hearts in a wonderful way. It is said that the very gifts of
                  miracles and prophesy are revived in him, as among the holy Apostles, and he has
                  been bestirring himself to have a General Council of the Church to look into these
                  matters. When I left Florence, a short time ago, the faction opposed to him broke
                  into the convent and took him away. I myself was there."</p>
               <p>"What!" said Agnes, "did they break into the convent of the San Marco? My uncle is
                  there."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and he and I fought side by side with the mob who were rushing in."</p>
               <p>"Uncle Antonio fight!" said Agnes, in astonishment.</p>
               <p>"Even women will fight, when what they love most is attacked," said the
                  knight.</p>
               <p>He turned to her, as he spoke, and saw in the moonlight a flash from her eye, and
                  an heroic expression on her face, such as he had never remarked before; but she
                  said nothing. The veil had been rudely torn from her eyes; she had seen with
                  horror the defilement and impurity of what she had ignorantly adored in holy
                  places, and the revelation seemed to have wrought a change in her whole
                  nature.</p>
               <p>"Even you could fight, Agnes," said the knight, "to save your religion from
                  disgrace."</p>
               <p>"No," said she; "but," she added, with gathering firmness<pb n="398-399"
                     xml:id="VAC7945-00000200"/> ness, "I could die. I should be glad to die with
                  and for the holy men who would save the honor of the true faith. I should like to
                  go to Florence to my uncle. If he dies for his religion, I should like to die with
                  him."</p>
               <p>"Ah, live to teach it to me!" said the knight, bending towards her, as if to
                  adjust her bridle-rein, and speaking in a voice scarcely audible. In a moment he
                  was turned again towards the Princess, listening to her.</p>
               <p>"So it seems," she said, "that we shall be running into the thick of the conflict
                  in Florence."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but my uncle hath promised that the King of France shall interfere. I have
                  hope something may even now have been done. I hope to effect something
                  myself."</p>
               <p>Agostino spoke with the cheerful courage of youth. Agnes glanced timidly up at
                  him. How great the change in her ideas! No longer looking on him as a wanderer
                  from the fold, an enemy of the Church, he seemed now in the attitude of a champion
                  of the faith, a defender of holy men and things against a base usurpation. What
                  injustice had she done him, and how patiently had he borne that injustice! Had he
                  not sought to warn her against the danger of venturing into that corrupt city?
                  Those words which so much shocked her, against which she had shut her ears, were
                  all true; she had found them so; she could doubt no longer. And yet he had
                  followed her, and saved her at the risk of his life. Could she help loving one who
                  had loved her so much, one so noble and heroic? Would it be a sin to love him? She
                  pondered the dark warnings of Father Francesco, and then thought of the cheerful,
                  fervent piety of her old uncle. How warm, how tender, how life-giving had been his
                  presence always! how full of faith and prayer, how fruitful of heavenly words and
                  thoughts had been all his ministrations!—and yet it was for him and with him and
                  his master that Agostino Sarelli was fighting, and against him the usurping head
                  of the Christian Church. Then there was another subject for pondering during this
                  night-ride. The secret of her birth had been told her by the Princess, who claimed
                  her as kinswoman. It had seemed to her at first like the revelations of a dream;
                  but as she rode and reflected, gradually the idea shaped itself in her mind. She
                  was, in birth and blood, the equal of her lover, and henceforth her life would no
                  more be in that lowly plane where it had always moved. She thought of the little
                  orange-garden at Sorrento, of the gorge with its old bridge, the Convent, the
                  sisters, with a sort of tender, wondering pain. Perhaps she should see them no
                  more. In this new situation she longed once more to see and talk with her old
                  uncle, and to have him tell her what were her duties.</p>
               <p>Their path soon began to be a wild clamber among the mountains, now lost in the
                  shadow of groves of gray, rustling olives, whose knotted, serpent roots coiled
                  round the rocks, and whose leaves silvered in the moonlight whenever the wind
                  swayed them. Whatever might be the roughness and difficulties of the way, Agnes
                  found her knight ever at her bridle-rein, guiding and upholding, steadying her in
                  her saddle when the horse plunged down short and sudden descents, and wrapping her
                  in his mantle to protect her from the chill mountain-air. When the day was just
                  reddening in the sky, the whole troop made a sudden halt before a square stone
                  tower which seemed to be a portion of a ruined building, and here some of the men
                  dismounting knocked at an arched door. It was soon swung open by a woman with a
                  lamp in her hand, the light of which revealed very black hair and eyes, and heavy
                  gold ear-rings.</p>
               <pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC7945-00000201"/>
               <p>"Have my directions been attended to?" said Agostino, in a tone of command. "Are
                  there places made ready for these ladies to sleep?"</p>
               <p>"There are, my Lord," said the woman, obsequiously,—"the best we could get ready
                  on so short a notice."</p>
               <p>Agostino came up to the Princess. "Noble Madam," he said, "you will value safety
                  before all things; doubtless the best that can be done here is but poor, but it
                  will give you a few hours for repose where you may be sure of being in perfect
                  safety."</p>
               <p>So saying, he assisted her and Agnes to dismount, and Elsie and Monica also
                  alighting, they followed the woman into a dark stone passage and up some rude
                  stone steps. She opened at last the door of a brick-floored room, where beds
                  appeared to have been hastily prepared. There was no furniture of any sort except
                  the beds. The walls were dusty and hung with cobwebs. A smaller apartment opening
                  into this had beds for Elsie and Monica.</p>
               <p>The travellers, however, were too much exhausted with their night-ride to be
                  critical, the services of disrobing and preparing for rest were quickly concluded,
                  and in less than an hour all were asleep, while Agostino was busy concerting the
                  means for an immediate journey to Florence.</p>

               <p>FATHER ANTONIO sat alone in his cell in the San Marco in an attitude of deep
                  dejection. The open window looked into the garden of the convent, from which
                  steamed up the fragrance of violet, jasmine, and rose, and the sunshine lay fair
                  on all that was without. On a table beside him were many loose and scattered
                  sketches, and an unfinished page of the Breviary he was executing, rich in quaint
                  tracery of gold and arabesques, seemed to have recently occupied his attention,
                  for his palette was wet and many loose brushes lay strewed around. Upon the table
                  stood a Venetian glass with a narrow neck and a bulb clear and thin as a
                  soap-bubble, containing vines and blossoms of the passion-flower, which he had
                  evidently been using as models in his work.</p>
               <p>The page he was illuminating was the prophetic Psalm which describes the ignominy
                  and sufferings of the Redeemer. It was surrounded by a wreathed border of
                  thorn-branches interwoven with the blossoms and tendrils of the passion-flower,
                  and the initial letters of the first two words were formed by a curious
                  combination of the hammer, the nails, the spear, the crown of thorns, the cross,
                  and other instruments of the Passion; and clear, in red letter, gleamed out those
                  wonderful, mysterious words, consecrated by the remembrance of a more than mortal
                  anguish,—"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</p>
               <pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC7945-00000202"/>
               <p>The artist-monk had perhaps fled to his palette to assuage the throbbings of his
                  heart, as a mourning mother flies to the cradle of her child; but even there his
                  grief appeared to have overtaken him, for the work lay as if pushed from him in an
                  access of anguish such as comes from the sudden recurrence of some overwhelming
                  recollection. He was leaning forward with his face buried in his hands, sobbing
                  convulsively.</p>
               <p>The door opened, and a man advancing stealthily behind laid a hand kindly on his
                  shoulder, saying softly, "So, so, brother!"</p>
               <p>Father Antonio looked up, and, dashing his hand hastily across his eyes, grasped
                  that of the new-comer convulsively, and saying only, "Oh, Baccio! Baccio!" hid his
                  face again.</p>
               <p>The eyes of the other filled with tears, as he answered gently,—</p>
               <p>"Nay, but, my brother, you are killing yourself. They tell me that you have eaten
                  nothing for three days, and slept not for weeks; you will die of this grief."</p>
               <p>"Would that I might! Why could not I die with him as well as Frà Domenico? Oh, my
                  master! my dear master!"</p>
               <p>"It is indeed a most heavy day to us all," said Baccio della Porta, the amiable
                  and pure-minded artist better known to our times by his conventual name of Frà
                  Bartolommeo. "Never have we had among us such a man; and if there be any light of
                  grace in my soul, his preaching first awakened it, brother. I only wait to see him
                  enter Paradise, and then I take farewell of the world forever. I am going to Prato
                  to take the Dominican habit, and follow him as near as I may."</p>
               <p>"It is well, Baccio, it is well," said Father Antonio; "but you must not put out
                  the light of your genius in those shadows,—you must still paint for the glory of
                  God."</p>
               <p>"I have no heart for painting now," said Baccio, dejectedly. "He was my
                  inspiration, he taught me the holier way, and he is gone."</p>
               <p>At this moment the conference of the two was interrupted by a knocking at the
                  door, and Agostino Sarelli entered, pale and disordered.</p>
               <p>"How is this?" he said, hastily. "What devils' carnival is this which hath broken
                  loose in Florence? Every good thing is gone into dens and holes, and every vile
                  thing that can hiss and spit and sting is crawling abroad. What do the princes of
                  Europe mean to let such things be?"</p>
               <p>"Only the old story," said Father Antonio,—"<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Principes
                     convenerunt in unum adversus Dominum, adversus Christum ejus</foreign>."</p>
               <p>So much were all three absorbed in the subject of their thoughts, that no kind of
                  greeting or mark of recognition passed among them, such as is common when people
                  meet after temporary separation. Each spoke out from the fulness of his soul, as
                  from an overflowing bitter fountain.</p>
               <p>"Was there no one to speak for him,—no one to stand up for the pride of Italy,—the
                  man of his age?" said Agostino.</p>
               <p>"There was one voice raised for him in the council," said Father Antonio. "There
                  was Agnolo Niccolini: a grave man is this Agnolo, and of great experience in
                  public affairs, and he spoke out his mind boldly. He told them flatly, that, if
                  they looked through the present time or the past ages, they would not meet a man
                  of such a high and noble order<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC7945-00000203"/> as this,
                  and that to lay at our door the blood of a man the like of whom might not be born
                  for centuries was too impious and execrable a thing to be thought of. I'll warrant
                  me, he made a rustling among them when he said that, and the Pope's commissary—old
                  Romalino—then whispered and frowned; but Agnolo is a stiff old fellow when he once
                  begins a thing,—he never minded it, and went through with his say. It seems to me
                  he said that it was not for us to quench a light like this, capable of giving
                  lustre to the faith even when it had grown dim in other parts of the world,—and
                  not to the faith alone, but to all the arts and sciences connected with it. If it
                  were needed to put restraint on him, he said, why not put him into some fortress,
                  and give him commodious apartments, with abundance of books, and pen, ink, and
                  paper, where he would write books to the honor of God and the exaltation of the
                  holy faith? He told them that this might be a good to the world, whereas
                  consigning him to death without use of any kind would bring on our republic
                  perpetual dishonor."</p>
               <p>"Well said for him!" said Baccio, with warmth; "but I'll warrant me, he might as
                  well have preached to the north wind in March, his enemies are in such a
                  fury."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," said Antonio, "it is just as it was of old: the chief priests and
                  Scribes and Pharisees were instant with loud voices, requiring he should be put to
                  death; and the easy Pilates, for fear of the tumult, washed their hands of
                  it."</p>
               <p>"And now," said Agostino, "they are putting up a great gibbet in the shape of a
                  cross in the public square, where they will hang the three holiest and best men of
                  Florence!"</p>
               <p>"I came through there this morning," said Baccio, "and there were young men and
                  boys shouting, and howling, and singing indecent songs, and putting up indecent
                  pictures, such as those he used to preach against. It is just as you say. All
                  things vile have crept out of their lair, and triumph that the man who made them
                  afraid is put down; and every house is full of the most horrible lies about
                  him,—things that they said he confessed."</p>
               <p>"Confessed!" said Father Antonio,—"was it not enough that they tore and tortured
                  him seven times, but they must garble and twist the very words that he said in his
                  agony? The process they have published is foully falsified,—stuffed full of
                  improbable lies; for I myself have read the first draught of all he
                     <emph>did</emph> say, just as Signor Ceccone took it down as they were
                  torturing him. I had it from Jacopo Manelli, canon of our Duomo here, and he got
                  it from Cecconne's wife herself. They not only can torture and slay him, but they
                  torture and slay his memory with lies."</p>
               <p>"Would I were in God's place for one day!" said Agostino, speaking through his
                  clenched teeth. "May I be forgiven for saying so!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>We</emph> are hot and hasty," said Father Antonio, "ever ready to call down
                  fire from heaven,—but after all, 'the Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice.' 'Unto
                  the upright there ariseth light in the darkness.' Our dear father is sustained in
                  spirit and full of love. Even when they let him go from the torture, he fell on
                  his knees, praying for his tormentors."</p>
               <p>"Good God! this passes me!" said Agostino, striking his hands together. "Oh,
                  wherefore hath a strong man arms and hands, and a sword, if he must stand still
                  and see such things done? If I had only my hundred mountaineers here, I would make
                  one charge for him to-morrow. If I could only <emph>do</emph> something!" he
                  added, striding impetuously<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC7945-00000204"/> up and down
                  the cell and clenching his fists. "What! hath nobody petitioned to stay this
                  thing?"</p>
               <p>"Nobody for him," said Father Antonio. "There was talk in the city yesterday that
                  Frà Domenico was to be pardoned; in fact, Romalino was quite inclined to do it,
                  but Battista Alberti talked violently against it, and so Romalino said, 'Well, a
                  monk more or less is n't much matter,' and then he put his name down for death
                  with the rest. The order was signed by both commissaries of the Pope, and one was
                  Frà Turiano, the general of our order, a mild man, full of charity, but unable to
                  stand against the Pope."</p>
               <p>"Mild men are nuisances in such places," said Agostino, hastily; "our times want
                  something of another sort."</p>
               <p>"There be many who have fallen away from him even in our house here," said Father
                  Antonio,—"as it was with our blessed Lord, whose disciples forsook him and fled.
                  It seems to be the only thought with some how they shall make their peace with the
                  Pope."</p>
               <p>"And so the thing will be hurried through to-morrow," said Agostino, "and when
                  it's done and over, I'll warrant me there will be found kings and emperors to say
                  they meant to have saved him. It's a vile, evil world, this of ours; an honorable
                  man longs to see the end of it. But," he added, coming up and speaking to Father
                  Antonio, "I have a private message for you."</p>
               <p>"I am gone this moment," said Baccio, rising with ready courtesy; "but keep up
                  heart, brother."</p>
               <p>So saying, the good-hearted artist left the cell, and Agostino said,—</p>
               <p>"I bring tidings to you of your kindred. Your niece and sister are here in
                  Florence, and would see you. You will find them at the house of one Gherardo
                  Rosselli, a rich citizen of noble blood."</p>
               <p>"Why are they there?" said the monk, lost in amazement.</p>
               <p>"You must know, then, that a most singular discovery hath been made by your niece
                  at Rome. The sister of her father, being a lady of the princely blood of Colonna,
                  hath been assured of her birth by the confession of the priest that married him;
                  and being driven from Rome by fear of the Borgias, they came hither under my
                  escort, and wait to see you. So, if you will come with me now, I will guide you to
                  them."</p>
               <p>"Even so," said Father Antonio.</p>

               <head type="sub">MARTYRDOM.</head>
               <p>IN a shadowy chamber of a room overlooking the grand square of Florence might be
                  seen, on the next morning, some of the principal personages of our story. Father
                  Antonio, Baccio della Porta, Agostino Sarelli, the Princess Paulina, Agnes, with
                  her grandmother, and a mixed crowd of citizens and ecclesiastics, who all spoke in
                  hushed and tremulous voices, as men do in the chamber of mourners at a funeral.
                  The great, mysterious bell of the Campanile was swinging with dismal,
                  heart-shaking toll, like a mighty voice from the spirit-world; and it was answered
                  by the tolling of all the bells in the city, making such wavering clangors and
                  vibrating circles in the air over Florence that it might seem as if it were full
                  of warring spirits wrestling for mastery.</p>
               <p>Toll! toll! toll! O great bell of the fair Campanile! for this day the noblest of
                  the wonderful men of Florence is to be offered up. Toll! for an era is going
                  out,—the era of her artists, her statesmen, her poets, and her scholars. Toll! for
                  an era is coming in,—the era of her disgrace and subjugation and misfortune!</p>
               <p>The stepping of the vast crowd in the square was like the patter of a great storm,
                  and the hum of voices rose up like the murmur of the ocean; but in the chamber all
                  was so still that one could have heard the dropping of a pin.</p>
               <p>Under the balcony of this room were seated in pomp and state the Papal
                  commissioners, radiant in gold and scarlet respectability; and Pilate and Herod,
                  on terms of the most excellent friendship, were ready to act over again the part
                  they had acted fourteen hundred years before. Now has arrived the moment when the
                  three followers of the Man of Calvary are to be degraded from the fellowship of
                  His visible Church.</p>
               <p>Father Antonio, Agostino, and Baccio, stood forth in the balcony, and, drawing in
                  their breath, looked down, as the three men of the hour, pale and haggard with
                  imprisonment and torture, were brought up amid the hoots and obscene jests of the
                  populace. Savonarola first was led before the tribunal, and there, with
                  circumstantial minuteness, endued with all his priestly vestments, which again,
                  with separate ceremonies of reprobation and ignominy, were taken from him. He
                  stood through it all serene as stood his Master when stripped of His garments on
                  Calvary. There is a momentary hush of voices and drawing in of breaths in the
                  great crowd. The Papal legate takes him by the hand and pronounces the words,
                  "Jerome Savonarola, I separate thee from the Church Militant and the Church
                  Triumphant."</p>
               <p>He is going to speak.</p>
               <p>"What says he?" said Agostino, leaning over the balcony.</p>
               <p>Solemnly and clear that impressive voice which so often had thrilled the crowds in
                  that very square made answer,—</p>
               <p>"From the Church Militant you <emph>may</emph> divide me; but from the Church
                  Triumphant, <emph>no,—that</emph> is above your power!"—and a light flashed out in
                  his face as if a smile from Christ had shone down upon him.</p>
               <p>"Amen!" said Father Antonio; "he hath witnessed a good confession,"—and turning,
                  he went in, and, burying his face in his hands, remained in prayer.</p>
               <pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC7945-00000206"/>
               <p>When like ceremonies had been passed through with the others, the three martyrs
                  were delivered to the secular executioner, and, amid the scoffs and jeers of the
                  brutal crowd, turned their faces to the gibbet.</p>
               <p>"Brothers, let us sing the Te Deum," said Savonarola.</p>
               <p>"Do not so infuriate the mob," said the executioner,—"for harm might be done."</p>
               <p>"At least let us repeat it together," said he, "lest we forget it."</p>
               <p>And so they went forward, speaking to each other of the glorious company of the
                  apostles, the goodly fellowship of the prophets, the noble army of martyrs, and
                  giving thanks aloud in that great triumphal hymn of the Church of all Ages.</p>
               <p>When the lurid fires were lighted which blazed red and fearful through that
                  crowded square, all in that silent chamber fell on their knees, and Father Antonio
                  repeated prayers for departing souls.</p>
               <p>To the last, that benignant right hand which had so often pointed the way of life
                  to that faithless city was stretched out over the crowd in the attitude of
                  blessing; and so loving, not hating, praying with exaltation, and rendering
                  blessing for cursing, the souls of the martyrs ascended to the great cloud of
                  witnesses above.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
               <head type="sub">CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>A FEW days after the death of Savonarola, Father Antonio was found one morning
                  engaged in deep converse with Agnes.</p>
               <p>The Princess Paulina, acting for her family, desired to give her hand to the
                  Prince Agostino Sarelli, and the interview related to the religious scruples which
                  still conflicted with the natural desires of the child.</p>
               <p>"Tell me, my little one," said Father Antonio, "frankly and truly, dost thou not
                  love this man with all thy heart?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my father, I do," said Agnes; "but ought I not to resign this love for the
                  love of my Saviour?"</p>
               <p>"I see not why," said the monk. "Marriage is a sacrament as well as holy orders,
                  and it is a most holy and venerable one, representing the divine mystery by which
                  the souls of the blessed are united to the Lord. I do not hold with Saint Bernard,
                  who, in his zeal for a conventual life, seemed to see no other way of serving God
                  but for all men and women to become monks and nuns. The holy order is indeed
                  blessed to those souls whose call to it is clear and evident, like mine; but if
                  there be a strong and virtuous love for a worthy object, it is a vocation unto
                  marriage, which should not be denied."</p>
               <p>"So, Agnes," said the knight, who had stolen into the room unperceived, and who
                  now boldly possessed himself of one of her hands——"Father Antonio hath decided
                     this<pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC7945-00000207"/> matter," he added, turning to
                  the Princess and Elsie, who entered, "and everything having been made ready for my
                  journey into France, the wedding ceremony shall take place on the morrow, and, for
                  that we are in deep affliction, it shall be as private as may be."</p>
               <p>And so on the next morning the wedding ceremony took place, and the bride and
                  groom went on their way to France, where preparations befitting their rank awaited
                  them.</p>
               <p>Old Elsie was heard to observe to Monica, that there was some sense in making
                  pilgrimages, since this to Rome, which she had undertaken so unwillingly, had
                  turned out so satisfactory.</p>
               <p>In the reign of Julius II., the banished families who had been plundered by the
                  Borgias were restored to their rights and honors at Rome; and there was a princess
                  of the house of Sarelli then at Rome, whose sanctity of life and manners was held
                  to go back to the traditions of primitive Christianity, so that she was renowned
                  not less for goodness than for rank and beauty.</p>
               <p>In those days, too, Raphael the friend of Frà Bartolommeo, placed in one of the
                  grandest halls of the Vatican, among the Apostles and Saints, the image of the
                  traduced and despised martyr whose ashes had been cast to the winds and waters in
                  Florence. His memory lingered long in Italy, so that it was even claimed that
                  miracles were wrought in his name and by his intercession. Certain it is, that the
                  living words he spoke were seeds of immortal flowers which blossomed in secret
                  dells and obscure shadows of his beautiful Italy.</p>
