            <p>THE fond mother, whose maternal breast is filled with alternate hopes and fears, as she sends her first-born into the world, to strive and battle with its stormy billows, feels scarcely more anxiety in the fate of the loved one, than does the authoress, as she presents her book to the eye of the public.

               <p>IN a plainly furnished room of a heat tenement, situated in the southern part of the city of "brotherly love," sat a young girl, her arm resting on a small table, where books and writing material lay promiscuously scattered. She had shaded her eyes with her hand, and appeared lost in profound meditation; her thoughts seemed engaged on<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6179-00000006"/> some painful subject. Ever and anon deep sighs escaped, and tears slowly and silently followed each other down her cheeks.</p>
               <p>Emily Mayland,—for that was the name she bore,—was of youthful appearance, yet, more than once, had the cup of sorrow been presented to her lips; and, though bitter was the draught, it had taught her submission. She had early learned where to look for consolation, and depend for strength. At length she aroused herself, though apparently with an effort, from thought, and taking up a small Bible, gazed long and earnestly on its clasp of gold, on which was inscribed—Agnes Lanthorp. At sight of the dearly loved name, Emily's tears started afresh; and opening the book, her eyes rested on the fly leaf, on which was written in, to her, a well-known hand—"My daughter: may she ever remember her mother's counsel, act only from principle, perform her duty, and leave the result to God." Underneath was written—"Trust in the Lord, and he will never forsake thee." These words had been written by her mother a short time before her death; for Emily had had the misfortune to lose that tender parent at the age of thirteen.</p>
               <p>Before proceeding further, it may not be improper to give the reader a short sketch of the early life of the mother of Emily. Her childhood had, indeed, been a happy one; blessed with parents whose affectionate care was untiring in endeavoring to plant in her young mind the seeds of all that is pure and beautiful, and to pluck out those unsightly weeds that would at times make their appearance, ere they had taken firm root.</p>
               <p>Her father, a stanch Presbyterian, possessed talents of no common order, and was highly educated; for Charles Lanthore did not feel that his course of studies was completed on leaving the University, where he had won high honors. Although designed for the pulpit, and attending faithfully to his various duties, he was still an eager scholar. As science unfolded new scenes, and rare beauties<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6179-00000007"/> ties, heedless of difficulties, he pressed onward in pursuit of knowledge. To persons unacquainted with his true character, he appeared somewhat cold and austere. Proud of his ancestry, for he could trace his lineage back to those hardy pilgrims, who, landing on Plymouth rock, feared not to face cold and famine, for the privilege of worshiping according to their faith. Just such a spirit had its home within the breast of the father of Agnes. Unflinching in his discharge of duty, he reproved the erring, counselled and encouraged the weak, sought to lead all to raise their thoughts above the things of time, and fix them on an endless eternity. He followed in the footsteps of his Divine Master, in visiting the sick, and doing all that lay in his power to soothe their afflictions. It was at the bed-side of suffering that the true beauty of his Christian graces was most apparent. There was not a cottage so small, or a family so humble in the parish of C..., as to be left unvisited by the pastor. How often were their wants relieved in the most unostentatious manner; so much so, that help oftentimes came to the needy, from an unknown quarter, and they knew not the donor. Such is the imperfect sketch I have endeavoured to draw of the character of this truly worthy man.</p>
               <p>Her mother, all love and tenderness for her only child, found it a delightful task to watch the unfolding of her youthful mind. Like her husband, she required strict obedience from her daughter, and sought by every means to gain her confidence, and richly were both her parents repaid for their earnest endeavours: if the unwavering love, and steady regard to their wishes could repay devoted parts, they must have felt they were indeed blessed in their child. She had just completed her seventeenth year, when an aunt, who had been spending the summer months at the beautiful and retired home of Agnes, and charmed with the society of her<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6179-00000008"/> graceful and intelligent niece, persuaded her parents to consent to Agnes returning home with her, and spending the winter season in Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>It was with reluctance they consented to part with their darling child, and even for a short time to place her under the guardianship of another. It was at tea-time the request was made. The bright eyes, and heightened color of Agnes told how delighted she was at the prospect. She had become warmly attached to her aunt, and was always pleased to listen to, and converse with her on city life. If she accompanied her aunt home, she would mingle more in society than she had ever had an opportunity of doing before; and bright indeed rose before her a vision of happiness. True, it was marred by the thoughts of being separated from her parents; but she would have frequent opportunities of receiving their letters, and it would be delightful to get letters from home. She had never been severed from her parents' care, and little did she then imagine the changes in her life, that talked-of-visit would bring to her. But we must not anticipate.</p>

               <p>LONG and anxious was the conversation between Mr. and Mrs. Lanthorp, on that eventful evening: they had observed the evident pleasure, with which Agnes had heard the request of her aunt. Perhaps it were best to allow her to be introduced into society, and mingle more in the world. They could not expect to keep their treasure always with them. Although her nature was warm and affectionate, yet they knew her principles were firm, and they had her entire confidence: so it was decided, that Agnes should spend the winter in the city.</p>
               <p>Great were the preparations at the parsonage in view of Agnes' journey. The village dress-maker (by the by, quite an important person,) was in requisition: dresses were altered, new ones made, while debates were of frequent occurrence between the aunt of Agnes and Miss Lyle, the aforesaid dress-maker, relating to the newest style. Mrs. Delany, for that was the name of Agnes' aunt, felt somewhat ruffled at her opinion being called in question by a dress-maker in such a retired village; she, whose taste was considered unequalled, and whose judgment was always sought in the circle in which she moved. While, on the other hand, Miss Lyle contended that she always obtained the very latest styles direct from the city, as soon as her friend, residing there, received them from Paris. She felt that her credit was at stake: no inhabitant of the parish would have had the hardihood to differ from Miss Lyle. Had any one been so presumptions, Miss Lyle would rather not undertake, was afraid she<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6179-00000010"/> would not please. In short, the unfortunate person was left entirely to her own resources, to get her dress-making accomplished as best she could.</p>
               <p>But in spite of differences of opinion, at length all was pronounced ready for the journey, they were to leave early on the morrow.</p>
               <p>Agnes had gone into the village to make a few purchases, and take leave of her friends. The warm afternoon was drawing to a close, for though the middle of September, the weather continued quite sultry. Agnes, having bidden adieu to her friends, turned her back upon the village, and slowly took the road that led to the parsonage. Her high spirits had flown, and as she ascended a piece of rising ground a feeling akin to melancholy stole over her. She reached the top just as the sun was sinking in the western horizon. His last beams were reflected on the windows of her loved home.</p>
               <p>Her father was slowly walking on the lawn in front of the house attended by his faithful friend Rollo, a large Newfoundland dog, much prized by his master, and indeed by all the household for his affection and sagacity.</p>
               <p>To Agnes her father's appearance betokened anxious thought, and she felt that it was indeed a great trial to her parents to part with her. Seating herself under a tree, and resting her head upon her hand, she gazed earnestly on the scene before her. What was it in that moment that rose between her and the sight of her loved home? an undefined shape, a shadowy something that seemed to say that henceforward she would no longer be an inhabitant of that loved abode of peace and contentment, as heretofore she had been.</p>
               <p>Unable to bear this state of feeling longer, she hastily arose, and taking up her hat, hastened down the hill, across the little wooden bridge that spanned the creek, where often in her childish days she had hunted white pebbles, or watched the little minnows dart through the water, or what she most delighted<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6179-00000011"/> lighted in, to launch a tiny fleet of paper boats.</p>
               <p>Those were bright and happy days for the minister's daughter; indeed, her whole life had been a joyous one, and Agnes could not understand her present feelings.</p>
               <p>Opening the gate, she glided to her father's side, and, putting her hand in his, silently walked toward the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lanthorp felt his daughter's hand tremble in his. For a moment he paused to steady his voice, ere he addressed her:</p>
               <p>"Does my Agnes fear to leave home, and mingle in society without her parents?" softly questioned Mr. Lanthorp.</p>
               <p>"I shall feel very lonely without you, dear father," murmured the now weeping Agnes.</p>
               <p>"I know not if I can keep the right way without your advice, and my precious mother's care."</p>
               <p>Mr. Lanthorp was silent for a moment, and then said, solemnly,—</p>
               <p>"Let my parting counsel, Agnes, sink deeply ly into your heart. In the first place, never neglect to spend a portion of each day in meditation and prayer. In the early morning and at the evening hour, strive to offer to Heaven the sacrifice of a contrite heart; for this is worship most acceptable to God. Attend closely to the voice of conscience. Ever give heed to the swift messenger that speaketh truth only. And, secondly, write home frequently. Give us an account of your thoughts and feelings, how you spend your time. Give your parents your entire confidence: they are your best earthly friends. Here is a present for you, my Agnes," he continued, taking from his pocket a small Bible, bound in velvet, with a plain gold clasp, on which her name was engraved.</p>
               <p>"I wish you to read a portion of its contents daily, my child, at the same hour you have been accustomed to so doing with your parents. We will do the same. Let your thoughts turn to your home at that time, my beloved one. Then,—assuming a playfulness<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6179-00000012"/> ness of manner he was far from really feeling—he spoke of the beautiful scenery she would pass through on her journey to the city, related an amusing adventure that once happened to him in passing over the same road, and continued his pleasant talk until Agnes could again smile, with almost her wonted cheerfulness.</p>
               <p>"Your mother and I," said Mr. Lanthorp, as they neared the door of the sitting-room, "feel willing to place you for a time under the care of your aunt, at whose house you will meet with the best society, for she delights to gather around her persons of refined minds, and cultivated intellects. I think it will be of advantage to you, my child, now that you are of proper age, to mingle more in society than you have hitherto had an opportunity of doing. Yet, it is not without fear, that we send our dove from the sheltering ark of home into an untried world."</p>
               <p>He would have added more, but the approach of a young girl, a friend of Agnes, put an end to conversation for the present, and together they entered the sitting-room, where they found Mrs. Delany quietly reading.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lanthorp inquired for his wife, and was informed that she was engaged up stairs. In a few moments she entered and announced that tea was ready. The meal was rather a sober one; all appeared busy with their own thoughts, and the hum of cheerful conversation was not heard as usual in the pleasant room where they took their evening meal. Even old Rollo, as he lay stretched on the door mat, had a sedate expression of countenance.</p>

               <p>AFTER tea all gathered into the parlor, or, as it was more frequently called by the family, the sitting-room. The moon was shining brightly through the windows and open door. Agnes thought it had never looked so beautiful before, and placing a chair near one of the windows, gazed through the vines that surrounded it, on the lovely scene without.</p>
               <p>Her friend had taken leave with many kind wishes that her visit might prove a pleasant one; her parents and aunt were seated at the door conversing in low tones.</p>
               <p>Agnes felt glad to be alone, and quietly hold communion with the tranquil scene. She had been excited during the busy hours of preparation, and now that it was over she felt a sense of loneliness at the thought of the morrow, and the parting, that would be very hard indeed—she scarcely allowed herself to think of it.</p>
               <p>She was startled from her reverie by the voice of her father calling for lights, and soon after, their voices might have been heard, together hymning their Creator's praise.</p>
               <p>Her father's prayer that night was indelibly recorded in the heart of Agnes. Soon after, Mrs. Delany left the room; wishing to retire early, to have a good night's sleep, so that she might feel rested and refreshed before she commenced her journey on the morrow.</p>
               <p>"I think my Agnes had better follow her Aunt's example." said Mrs. Lanthorp, approaching the windom at which her daughter was standing, and gently smoothing back a stray curl. We have all been so busy to-day<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6179-00000014"/> day, and you in particular, my dear, that you will require a long night's rest to refresh and strengthen you for the morrow's journey. We must have breakfast by sunrise, as the cars leave for the city at an early hour."</p>
               <p>Agnes looked smilingly at her mother, and prepared to obey. Affectionately kissing her parents, she retired to her room.</p>
               <p>It was long, very long, ere sleep visited her. The hurry and excitement of packing trunks, taking leave of dear friends, and visiting favourite places, all combined to drive the sweet slumbers from the eyelids of the fair girl, and shut her senses from the knowledge of all outward things. Her gentle breathing, and calm face spoke of a heart at peace, and pure as an infant slumbering on its mother's breast.</p>
               <p>It was early morning when she awoke, with an undefined feeling of weight on her mind, yet with something agreeable mingled with it. The next moment brought all clear before her, and springing out of bed, she hastened tened to bathe her face in pure cold water, and turning to her dressing-glass began to arrange her luxuriant hair.</p>
               <p>Having accomplished her task, she drew aside the curtain from the window, and gazed on the scene without. The sun had not yet risen. The gentle West wind was playing among the leaves of the great chestnut trees that reared their giant forms in front of the house. On every blade of grass was hung a pearl, which the brightness of day would soon convert into a sparkling diamond.</p>
               <p>The early morning—who has not felt the calm influence of that peaceful hour? To a thoughtful mind, like that of Agnes, it inspires the heart to holy contemplation, and bows the spirit in adoration before the throne of the great Ruler of nature. It is then, obedient to his mandate, darkness retires, and the young day springs into existence, what time so fitted to crave the blessing of our Heavenly Parent, and ask his protecting care?</p>
               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6179-00000015"/>
               <p>Such were the devotional feelings of Agnes, as, with her head resting against the window, she noted not the swiftly passing moments, until the voice of her mother calling her, and announcing that breakfast was on the table, aroused her from her meditation. Hurriedly finishing her toilet, she descended to the room, where she found the family assembled at the table awaiting her. The meal was despatched in less time than usual.</p>
               <p>"Now all hands get ready for a drive," said Mr. Lanthorp, trying to appear cheerful, as they arose from the table.</p>
               <p>The ladies dispersed to their rooms, and he was left alone. In a few minutes he was joined by his wife and Mrs. Delany, prepared for the journey to the Depot, about five miles distant from the home of Mr. Lanthorp.</p>
               <p>Agnes' parents had decided to accompany them thus far, and see them safely in the cars.</p>
               <p>Soon her light step was heard coming down the stairs, and the next moment she joined her aunt and parents, who were standing in the verandah.</p>
               <p>Well might those fond parents feel a glow of something akin to pride, as their eyes rested on the lovely girl. Her height was about the medium size, of slight figure, her plainly made linen travelling dress, fitting closely to the waist, the skirt falling in graceful folds around her.</p>
               <p>She wore a bonnet of fine English straw, with a graceful wreath of artificial wild roses around it, rivalling natural ones in beauty, where delicate green leaves could be seen peeping here and there among them. Her dress had been chosen by Mrs. Delany, and never had her taste been displayed with better success than on the present occasion. Her hair, that well might rival the jetty plumage of the raven's wing, hung in luxuriant ringlets over her fair neck and faultless shoulders. The rich glow of health mantled her cheeks. Her mouth, by many persons,<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6179-00000016"/> would not have been considered perfect, but the bright smile that loved to linger there, and a sweetness of expression, spread a charm, which few could resist. Combined with eyes of surpassing beauty, no one could meet her frank clear gaze, without feeling that the spirit which looked through those bright orbs was purity itself: whether they overflowed in liquid loveliness at a tale of sorrow, or beamed with love and tenderness, as they met the fond glances of her parents, or danced with glee, as she galloped her pony over hill and dale, they were alike beautiful.</p>
               <p>She excelled in riding, and rarely did a day pass without making an excursion on horse-back. Sometimes accompanied by her father, or more frequently alone, she explored wood and common for miles around. Agnes was always delighted when her father was at leisure to ride with her. Every thing that came under their notice was made an object of interest to Agnes by the explanation tion of Mr. Lanthorp. He opened to her the wondrous science of botany, explained the adaptation of plants to certain soils, and their various uses, until Agnes became so interested in the study, that she continued it until she became a proficient in that beautiful science. Much knowledge was imparted to his daughter, by Mr. Lanthorp, during those morning rides.</p>

               <p>BUT we have wandered from the group we left standing on the verandah, awaiting the arrival of the carriage. It has come to a halt in front of the house, and Mr. Lanthorp having handed the ladies in, takes his seat in front with the driver, preferring to ride in the open air this lovely morning.</p>
               <p>As the coach is slowly driven down the road, Agnes turned to the window, to take a last look at the dear old house, with its graystone front, its old-fashioned windows, with small panes,—around which clustered honeysuckles, and climbing roses, in graceful wreathes, and festoons,—among which were mingled the delicate fibres of the nightblooming jessamine, shedding abroad a rich perfume. The tall chestnuts waved their giant branches, as if they were bidding her adieu. They were old friends to Agnes: she had played beneath their shade ever since she could remember, and she loved them dearly: she continued looking at them until they faded out of sight.</p>
               <p>On arriving at the Station, they found a number of persons waiting the coming of the train. Mr. Lanthorp hastened to purchase tickets, and returned to the ladies just as the signal whistle announced the approach of the cars. They only halted for a few minutes at this place.</p>
               <p>Tenderly kissing her daughter, and, without speaking, pressing her lips to those of her sister, Mrs. Lanthorp entered the Ladies' Saloon, there to await her husband. Folding<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6179-00000018"/> Agnes in his arms, he breathed a parent's blessing on his darling one, lifted her on to the platform, assisted Mrs. Delany, saw them both comfortably seated; then the whistle shrieked, and they were fairly on their journey.</p>
               <p>Agnes sat by the window, nothing the ever-changing scene of hill and valley, wood and common, interspersed with cultivated fields, and orchards bending under their weight of fruit. She became interested, as the cars halted at the various stations along the road, in witnessing from her window the warm greetings, of delighted friends, or the tearful partings of those who were about getting on.</p>
               <p>At half past twelve o'clock, a brief time was allowed for dinner. Our travellers, after a hasty meal, entered the cars again, which were soon in motion.</p>
               <p>The day was drawing to a close as they came in sight of brick-yards, heaps of rubbish, oyster shells, ponds on which ducks and geese were swimming, and around whose margins children were playing; tall factories, in which the clanking and groaning of machinery could be heard, all betokened their approach to a large city.</p>
               <p>In a short time the train stopped; the locomotive was removed, and horses attached.</p>
               <p>"Well, Agnes," said Mrs. Delany, "I am glad we are almost at the end of our journey. You look fatigued; you are more unused to travelling than I."</p>
               <p>Agnes smiled, and answered, that she was a little tired, but felt quite well.</p>
               <p>They were now fairly in the city, and the next moment were safely landed in the depot. Poor Agnes was perfectly bewildered, as they stepped from the car, and clung tightly to the arm of her aunt; the glare of the gas-lights, people crowding one another, porters hurrying to and fro with trunks and carpet-bags, hack-drivers calling or insisting on persons taking a carriage; all formed a scene of wild confusion, such as she had never before witnessed.</p>
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6179-00000019"/>
               <p>Amid all this tumult Mrs. Delany walked calmly towards the ladies' saloon.</p>
               <p>When just about to enter, her eye fell on a middle-aged colored man. Beckoning him to approach, she inquired about things at home, and gave the man directions relative to their baggage.</p>
               <p>"My coachman," she said, in answer to Agnes' look, as he turned to obey her orders: "he has been in my employ for years, and is faithful, well deserving the confidence placed in him." Entering the carriage, they were driven to the residence of Mrs. Delany, situate in Walnut Street.</p>
               <p>The man rang the bell, assisted the ladies to alight, and they were admitted by a pleasant-looking Irish girl.</p>
               <p>"Well, Ann," said Mrs. Delany, "how have you been getting along in my absence?"</p>
               <p>"Right well, ma'am," answered the girl, "though it's pleased I am to see you home again, and looking so well, too."</p>
               <p>"Has Jane prepared the room for Miss Lanthorp, as I gave directions in the note I sent her?" said Mrs. Delany.</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am; she finished it this morning,"answered the girl.</p>
               <p>"Tell her to go to Miss Lanthorp's room, and be ready to assist her to dress, and see that her trunks are carried up without delay," said Mrs. Delany, as she and Agnes turned to go up stairs.</p>
               <p>"This is your room," my dear. Does it look pleasant?" said her aunt, as she ushered her niece into a prettily furnished room, that looked the very abode of comfort.</p>
               <p>"My dear, kind aunt, how thoughtful you have been!—and what pains you have taken to make me happy!" said the grateful girl, kissing her aunt affectionately.</p>
               <p>"Here is a treat, aunty," said Agnes, as she drew near to a book-case, and opened one of the doors." that delightful hours I hope to spend making friends of these! Ah here is Cowper, Dryden, Scott, Milton, Hemans,<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6179-00000020"/> Sigourney, and Dickens, inimitable Dickens!—are not his Household Words delightful?"</p>
               <p>"Come, come, Agnes," said her aunt, smiling at her niece's earnestness, "let the authors remain where they are for the present. See, here is Jane waiting to help you off with your dress," said Mrs. Delany, as she left the room.</p>
               <p>Agnes had just completed her toilet, when her aunt knocked at the door, and they went down stairs together.</p>
               <p>They found tea on the table. Agnes, notwithstanding her fatigue, had an excellent appetite after her long ride, and enjoyed the meal, and her aunt's lively chat. After supper they went into the parlor, where Agnes amused herself by looking at several fine paintings,—among which she noticed a portrait of her uncle. She remembered to have seen him once, at her home, when she was quite a child. His distant, and rather haughty bearing, had been an effectual bar to any advances on the part of the little Agnes; and as he very seldom noticed her, she thought of him only as a stranger. Mrs. Delany rarely mentioned her husband's name. Agnes had been present at different times during conversations between her parents, relating to her uncle, and she inferred from what she overheard, that her aunt was not happy during her married life.</p>

               <p>MRS. DELANY had no children, and was delighted to have her niece with her. Several weeks sped pleasantly away. Agnes heard from home frequently. Her letters to her parents were satisfactory. She was busy one day writing a long letter to her mother, when she was interrupted by the entrance of her aunt with a note in her hand.</p>
               <p>"Here is an invitation to Mrs. E's. company next week, my dear; next Thursday evening," said she, "glancing at the note. You will, I have no doubt, spend a pleasant evening. Mrs. E. is a charming woman, and well calculated to make her guests enjoy themselves."</p>
               <p>Agnes was pleased at the prospect of again meeting with Mrs. E., who a short time before had called at Mrs. Delany's. Her gentle and affectionate manners had quite won the heart of the artless girl.</p>
               <p>It was late in the evening, on the following Thursday, before Agnes and her Aunt left home. They found most of the company already assembled.</p>
               <p>As they were ushered into the rooms, they were met by Mr. E., and conducted to where his wife was seated, engaged in conversation. She arose, and warmly greeted Mrs. Delany and the blushing Agnes. Turning toward the group she had been conversing with, she introduced them, and invited Agnes to a seat beside her, on the sofa.</p>
               <p>"Who is that lovely girl with Mrs. E.?"<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6179-00000022"/> asked Edward Mayland of a gentleman standing near him.</p>
               <p>"Miss Lanthorp, Mrs. Delany's niece," answered the gentleman. "She is from the country. I have met with her several times at her aunt's; and truly she is an ornament to her sex. Highly educated, with manners simple as a child, yet so dignified in her bearing. She is a charming companion. Come with me and I will give you an introduction.</p>
               <p>"I will accompany you with the greatest pleasure," said the young man.</p>
               <p>During most of the evening, Edward Mayland made one of the group around Agnes; he walked with her, conversed with her; in short, used every effort to make himself agreeable; and when they left, handed her to the carriage.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, he became a constant visitor at Mrs. Delany's. That he was deeply interested in the fair girl was plainly to be seen, while the heightened color of Agnes, at the mention of his name, showed that she was not indifferent to his attentions. Mrs. Delany was troubled, perplexed. Edward Mayland was not the man she would have chosen as the husband of her niece; not that aught could be spoken against his character, or his family.</p>
               <p>Well educated, and of refined manners, in what was he lacking? He was one of a firm doing a thriving business. But Mrs. Delany felt that he was wanting in energy, and that his talents were not of a high order. His affectionate manners and untiring devotion had won the heart of Agnes before she was aware of it herself.</p>
               <p>One afternoon near the close of winter, Mrs. Delany was sitting in the library reading a letter she had just received from Mr. Lanthorp, making arrangements for the return of his daughter home. Her mother's health had been failing for some time. Mrs. Lanthorp had avoided writing to Agnes on the subject, as she did not wish to excite alarm, or hurry her home before Spring, the<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6179-00000023"/> time agreed upon for her return. She had almost finished reading when the door was gently opened, and her niece glided into the room. Coming to the side of her aunt, she threw her arms around her neck, hiding her face in her bosom, and confessed her affection for young Mayland. He had declared his love for her, and besought her, in earnest tones, to speak one word of hope. She did not deny that he was dear to her, but immediately referred him to her parents, as their consent must first be obtainecd.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Delany raised her niece's head, and tenderly kissed her blushing cheek, bidding her to lie down on the sofa, and endeavor to compose herself, while she answered Mr. Lanthorp's letter. For some time Agnes lay quite still, trying to reduce her confused thoughts to something like order. At length, she fell into a light slumber, and when she awoke she found that her aunt had finished her letter, and was waiting to let her read it.</p>
               <p>"You read it to me, please, aunty," said Agnes.</p>
               <p>After Mrs. Delany had finished reading, she inquired if it met with the approval of her niece.</p>
               <p>"Yes, aunty, it is exactly what I would have wished you to write," answered Agnes.</p>
               <p>"Here is your father's letter, my dear; you have not read it yet," said Mrs. Delany, handing it to her niece.</p>
               <p>Agnes was much grieved to hear of her mother's failing health, and was anxious to return home immediately.</p>
               <p>"I am not afraid to travel alone. I wish to start in the early train to-morrow. Could we not get ready by that time?" said Agnes, with a look of anxiety.</p>
               <p>"We might be prepared for you to leave here on the morrow; but I fear your parents would not wish you to travel alone, and it is impossible for me to accompany you."</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6179-00000024"/>
               <p>They were interrupted by the entrance of Jane, who said, "Mr. Mayland is in the parlour."</p>
               <p>"Go down, aunty; I will be there presently," said Agnes.</p>
               <p>When Edward Mayland heard that Agnes proposed going alone, he insisted on accompanying her. The heart of the fair girl trembled.</p>
               <p>How would her lover be received by her parents? Would they welcome him to their home, and give their blessing on their union? were some of the thoughts that passed rapidly through the mind of Agnes.</p>
               <p>The morrow dawned at last. Agnes had passed an almost sleepless night, and had arisen early to finish her hasty preparations. At the proper time they were at the depot, and not long afterward they were on their journey. They were unexpectedly met at the depot by Mr. Lanthorp; who had come there on business. She sprang into his arms, and her pent up feelings found vent in a flood of tears.</p>
               <p>"Your dear mother is easier to-day," said her father, before Agnes could command her voice, to ask the question.</p>

               <p>"THIS is Mr. Mayland, papa," said Agnes, blushing, as she turned to where her betrothed was standing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lanthorp shook hands with the gentleman, apologized for his being left so long without an introduction, invited him home, and together they entered the carriage, and were driven to the parsonage. Agnes sprang out of the vehicle, as it halted at the door, and hastened to her mother's room. The first intimation that lady had of her daughter's arrival, was to find herself eagerly embraced by her cherished one.</p>
               <p>"My own dear mother! how delighted I am to be with you again;" then, colouring deeply, she whispere, "Mr. Mayland is here, dear mother, down stairs with papa: he was not willing that I should come alone. Will you not consent to our happiness?"</p>
               <p>"If your father and I think it will tend to your happiness, my child, our consent will not be withheld, you may rest assured." Some time elapsed, and Mr. Mayland still lingered at the parsonage. He sought an early opportunity to speak to Mr. Lanthorp on the subject nearest his heart,—frankly told his business expectations, and warmly pressed his suit.</p>
               <p>Feeling that the happiness of their child depended on it, they gave their consent, though not without reluctance. Their hearts misgave them when they looked into the future. Not that they thought he ever would be aught than kind to Agnes. But there was a depth of character in her that was not understood<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6179-00000026"/> derstood by him. Their dispositions were widely different.</p>
               <p>At the earnest solicitation of Mr. Mayland, an early day was agreed upon for the wedding. Only a few persons were present; her father performed the ceremony; and Lizzie Lee, the friend of her childhood, acted the part of bridesmaid. We have hurriedly passed over the months of Agnes' betrothment, and the particulars of her wedding—leaving it to the imagination of the reader to picture the fair bride and happy husband; for our candid opinion is that such things are only interesting to the parties concerned.</p>
               <p>Let us also pass over the tearful parting of Agnes from the home of her infancy, and the warm welcome she received from her aunt and Mr. Mayland's mother, at the door of her future home in the city, where they greeted her as its mistress. Agnes had not been long a wife, before she made the painful discovery that there was not such perfect harmony in their dispositions, as so to unite their minds, that no discordant jar should mar the melody of the spirits' converse. Her husband loved her tenderly, but his soul could not soar to lofty regions, where her thoughts delighted to wander.</p>
               <p>She was sitting at the window one evening, about a year after their marriage, awaiting the return of her husband. She had just caught sight of him crossing the street, and hastened to open the door.</p>
               <p>"My Agnes wants the fresh air of her native village, to bring back the roses to her cheeks," said Mr. Mayland, as he affectionately kissed his young wife. "I have been thinking of sending you home for awhile," continued he, smiling, as he turned toward the parlor door.</p>
               <p>Agnes was about to follow, when her steps were arrested by the servant handing her a letter. One glance showed her it was directed in her father's well-known hand. She turned pale, as she noticed it was marked in haste.</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6179-00000027"/>
               <p>"There is something the matter at home, Edward," said Agnes, as she tore open the envelope, and hurriedly read the contents.</p>
               <p>Her father entreated her to come home immediately, to assist in soothing the remaining hours of her mother.</p>
               <p>She had taken cold a few weeks ago, he wrote, and inflammation of the lungs had set in. She had sunk rapidly; and the attending physician gave it as his opinion, that she could not last many days longer.</p>
               <p>"We will start in the night train, my love," said Mr. Mayland, who had been reading over his wife's shoulder. "Get ready a few things, while I order a carriage. We will have no time to spare," he added, hurrying from the room.</p>
               <p>It was shortly after sun-rise, when Agnes and her husband arrived at the parsonage. They were met in the hall by her father, who silently embraced his weeping daughter.</p>
               <p>"She is easier to-day," he said, in answer to Mr. Mayland's inquiries, for poor Agnes was unable to speak. "She longs for your presence, my child," said Mr. Lanthorp, in a husky voice. "Endeavour to command your feelings as much as possible, Agnes. The doctor wishes her to be kept free from all excitement."</p>
               <p>"Agnes stepped softly up stairs, and gently pushed open the door. Light as her foot-steps fell on the carpeted stairs, they had been heard by the invalid. With an effort, she raised her head, exclaiming, "My child! my darling Agnes;" and fell back upon the pillow in a swoon. The terrified Agnes called for assistance. Both gentlemen ran up stairs; and the nurse hurried in from an adjoining room, and hastened to apply restoratives. Vain were their efforts; the excitement of meeting with her daughter had been too much for Mrs. Lanthorp. Frail nature gave way; and in a short time her pure spirit had taken its homeward flight. We shall not attempt to describe the grief of Mr. Lanthorp. And poor Agnes, how desolate was<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6179-00000028"/> her childhood's home without her tender mother! She would have urged her father to return to the city with them; but she knew how well beloved he was by the members of his church, and that no persuasion could induce him to give up the care of his flock. After spending several weeks at the parsonage, Agnes and her husband returned to the city.</p>
               <p>"God will sustain me, under this heavy dispensation, my Agnes," said her father, solemnly, one day, as he noticed her anxious look fixed tenderly on him. "There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother." He has been with me through many trying seasons, and he will not desert me in this. I will find more consolation in attending to my duties here, than if I left to accompany you; and though the loved partner of my home is not here to cheer my lonely hours, I can still hold sweet communion with her. Our spirits are not separated. I shall join her, ere long, in the blessed mansions of eternal rest.</p>

               <p>ABOUT six months after the death of Mrs. Lanthrop, Agnes became the mother of a lovely daughter. What joy thrilled the young parent's heart as she clasped the little treasure to her breast, and never wearied in gazing on its tiny features, or softly pressing its small hands between her own. She named her infant Emily, after her mother, and prayed for strength to enable her to train her darling for the Lord's service. She felt it would be a delightful task to watch the unfolding intellect, as day by day it gradually expanded, like the opening rose-bud.</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6179-00000029"/>
               <p>Little Emily was about six months old, when Agnes received a telegraphic dispatch, giving an account of the sudden death of her father. He had taken tea in his usual health, but before midnight was a corpse. Such were the particulars that she afterwards learned from the housekeeper. His death was a great shock to Agnes; her health had been quite delicate since the birth of Emily, and it was long before she recovered her wonted cheerfulness of manner. But time, that great soother of grief, softened its keen edge; and the little Emily daily, grew more interesting. She could speak that name so dear to a parent's heart; and her sweet prattle cheered, and insensibly drew the mind of Agnes from indulging in sorrowful reflections.</p>
               <p>Let us now pass over several years, and again visit the home of Agnes Mayland. It is not in the same street as formerly.</p>
               <p>The firm in which Mr. Mayland was a partner had engaged in speculation and failed. They were enabled to satisfy the demands of their creditors, and leave a small amount to be divided among them. The little that fell to the share of Mr. Mayland, was placed by him in a savings bank, and he found employment, as book-keeper, in a large importing house.</p>
               <p>They soon after left their home, and removed to their present dwelling. It was much smaller than the one they formerly occupied; but large enough for comfort.</p>
               <p>Agnes had lost her aunt during those years. Mrs. Delany had become quite reduced, owing to the failure of a bank in which the greater part of her money was invested. She did not long survive the loss of her property; and died, leaving to Agnes the remnant of her fortune, to be expended for the education of Emily. She had grown to be a lovely child, devoted to her mother, whose delicate health forbade her to undertake the entire charge of her daughter's education, as she had at first intended doing.</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6179-00000030"/>
               <p>One day, when Emily was in her fourteenth year, she came home from school, and, as usual, sought her mother's room. She found Mrs. Mayland lying on the bed, suffering with a severe pain in her head. Her cheeks were flushed, and her pulse beat quickly. Hastening to her side, Emily fondly kissed her mother's feverish lips, and asked if there were not something she could do for her.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my love," replied Mrs. Mayland;</p>
               <p>"I wish you would close the blinds, and hand me a glass of water."</p>
               <p>Emily did as her mother desired her; and taking her seat near the bed, anxiously awaited her father's return. It was almost dark when she heard him open the front door. With a light step, she hastened out of the room, lest she should disturb her mother, who was in an uneasy sleep, and meeting her father in the entry, she told him of her mother's illness. Hastening to his wife's room, Mr. Mayland was alarmed at her appearance, and went immediately for a physician. In a few minutes he returned, accompanied by the doctor. Her fever had increased rapidly within an hour.</p>
               <p>The doctor felt her pulse, inquired how long she had been ailing, prescribed some soothing medicine, to be administered through the night, and promised to see her again in the morning.</p>
               <p>Throughout the slow-moving hours of that long, long night, poor Emily and her father sat by the bedside of the sufferer, who tossed and threw her arms about, muttering incoherent sentences. Towards morning she relapsed into a stupor; and was in that state when the doctor visited her the next day. He at once pronounced her disease typhoid fever.</p>
               <p>For weeks Mrs. Mayland lay unconscious of all that was passing around her. At length the crisis approached; the fever left her extremely weak. The doctor came, looked at his patient, ordered her a few<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6179-00000031"/> drops of wine, in a tea-spoonful of water, to be given at short intervals, and took his leave. For a short time Mrs. Mayland lay quite still; they thought she was asleep, but such was not the case. She knew that her time on earth was short; that her summons had indeed come; and there were some things she wished to say while strength remained. Opening her eyes, she called her daughter in a feeble voice. Emily sprang to the bed, and stooped down to listen.</p>
               <p>"Hand me my Bible, daughter," she said. Emily reached out her hand, and taking a small book from a table that stood near, handed it to her mother. Taking it in her hand, she thus addressed her daughter:</p>
               <p>"This Bible was my father's gift, Emily. He gave it to me when I was a young girl, and desired me to study it carefully. I have endeavoured to follow his advice. It has indeed been a lamp to my feet in life's journey, and at present casts its bright radiance over the valley of death, through which I feel I am now passing. Do not weep so, my Emily, but listen to my last counsel. Take this book, your mother's Bible, read it as I have done; let its precepts guide your every action. Study what I have written on the blank leaf. Never forget those truths, my dear child. There are two paths open for you to walk in. One is straight and narrow, and leads to life eternal. The way, at times, may appear steep and rugged; but if you earnestly desire to walk therein, strength will be given you to overcome every difficulty as it arises. The steep and rugged way will be made smooth to your feet as you journey on. Ever strive to keep that straight road. The other is wide, and beaten by the footsteps of many travellers; but go not in that way, my child, for the end is destruction."</p>
               <p>Then looking toward her husband, she said tenderly, "My Edward, my kind, devoted husband." Speechless with grief, Mr. Mayland silently pressed the thin hand of his wife between both his own.</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6179-00000032"/>
               <p>"God will sustain you, my Edward," she softly murmured. Then, after a pause, she continued: "After I am gone, I wish you to place Emily at Mrs. B's. boarding-school, in Boston. I know of no one who is better qualified to undertake the charge of her. I am desirous for her to have a thorough education. Let the money left by my aunt be set apart and devoted to that purpose. I could have wished to have lived a few years longer, and seen her grow to womanhood; but such is not the Lord's will, and I bow in submission to his all-wise decree. I feel that I am growing weaker. Kiss me, my husband; where is Emily?—it is growing dark." <q>

               <p>WE will pass over the months of mourning that ensued, and again resume our story. Emily has been, for several weeks, an inmate of Mrs. B's. school, where her gentle manners and unwavering regard for truth won the love and respect of both teachers and pupils. Mr. Mayland had given up house-keeping shortly after Emily left home; and was now boarding in a private family, consisting of three individuals; namely, Mrs. Lane, her daughter Susanna, a young lady of some twenty-five summers, and a brother of Mrs. Lane's.</p>
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6179-00000033"/>
               <p>This gentleman had never married; was rather eccentric in his manners, as single men frequently are; never speaking unless addressed, and then using as few words as possible. Mrs. Lane was a thrifty housekeeper; always busy, except at meal time; and let the rest of the family be in what mood they might, she was always cheerful.</p>
               <p>Miss Susanna, a tall, dark-haired young lady, was particularly attentive to the wants of her mother's boarder.</p>
               <p>For some time, the attention, or even the presence of the young lady, was scarcely noticed by Mr. Mayland. But at length her regard for his comfort began to be seen and felt by that gentleman; and one day, about two years after the death of her mother, Emily received a letter from her father, stating that he expected shortly to be married again. Poor Emily was stunned at this announcement.</p>
               <p>The idea of her father's marrying again had never entered her mind. How could she see any one take her dear mother's place? She felt she could not call another by that loved name. She was miserable; and drawing a chair near a window, she sat down, and tried to collect her thoughts. Vacation would come on in about three weeks; then she was to go home for a short time. She wondered if the wedding would take place before that time. She hoped not.</p>
               <p>How much she wished that her father had mentioned when it would take place. But as he had not, she would have to remain in doubt until she reached Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>The three weeks passed rapidly away; and, one morning, Emily found herself sitting in the cars, under the care of a gentleman, and in great trepidation, as she neared her native city.</p>
               <p>She was met at the depot by her father. He was alone;—she felt thankful for that. He took her hand, passed it through his arm, and led her into the ladies' saloon, and up to<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6179-00000034"/> where a lady was sitting, whom he introduced as his wife.</p>
               <p>Poor Emily trembled so that she could hardly stand; and without raising her eyes, held out her hand. It was taken rather coldly by the step-mother; who was offended, she scarcely knew why, at the young girl's agitation.</p>
               <p>Emily returned to Boston in a few days; she did not feel at ease in Mrs. Mayland's society. She was so unlike her own dear mother. She remained at school about two years longer, and was now in her eighteenth year. Her education was completed; and she left the residence of her mother's friend with feelings of the deepest regret, and again turned her face towards her father's house.</p>
               <p>Every thing appeared much as it had two years ago; only the addition of a little prattler had been added to the family since she had last been home.</p>
               <p>The little fellow was almost a year old, bright and active; he was named Edward, after his father. Eddy he was generally called.</p>
               <p>Emily had not been at home long, before she found that her presence was by no means agreeable to Mrs. Mayland. Every token of affection she received from her father was viewed with a jealous eye by his wife, who generally contrived to engage him either in conversation with herself, or by calling his attention to the playful infant.</p>
               <p>The young girl felt herself alone in her father's house, and resolved to use her endeavours to obtain a situation as teacher in a boarding-school. She knew that she was qualified to fill such a situation. Accordingly, she determined to mention it to her father, as soon as she had an opportunity of speaking with him.</p>
               <p>It was Saturday afternoon; Emily and her step-mother had been more than usually reserved that day, and she felt that her conduct had not been without blame. She reflected calmly upon the course she ought to<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6179-00000035"/> have pursued. Mrs. Mayland had been busy at work all day. Ought she not to have offered her assistance. Conscience showed her her fault; and with a more humble mind she went down stairs into the kitchen, where she found Mrs. Mayland, with Eddy on her arm. She was engaged setting the table for tea, and looked heated and tired. "Let me take him," said Emily, speaking in a gentle tone; at the same time holding out her hands to the little one, who was crying loudly.</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't care if you do take him awhile," said his mother in a rather ungracious voice. I don't know what has come over the child, to carry on as he has been doing."</p>
               <p>Emily took the little fellow in her arms, and carried him into the parlor; where he was soon deeply engaged in looking at some bright coloured prints, and, in his pretty lisping way, pointing to "big horsie, and the 'title dody."</p>
               <p>At length he seemed to weary of these, and began to fret again. Laying away the pictures, she commenced rocking him gently to and fro, softly singing the while, some of those wonderful nursery rhymes, that have charmed children to sleep for many generations. She had rehearsed the touching story of "Ba, ba, black sheep," and one or two others, when she found that he was in a sound slumber. Carrying him to his cradle, she softly laid him in it, just as the door opened, and Mrs. Mayland entered, followed by a girl.</p>
               <p>"Well, I am really glad you have got him asleep, at last," said she, in a more kindly voice than she had spoken to Emily that day, and bending over the cradle, she looked at her sleeping boy with a mother's tenderness. I came to tell you that your father has come in, and supper is ready. "Here, Jane," said Mrs. Mayland, sternly, "sit down by this cradle, and don't move from it till I come in again."</p>
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6179-00000036"/>
               <p>The girl sullenly obeyed, and her mistress left the room.</p>
               <p>"I think he will sleep soundly, poor little boy. How tired he was," said Emily.</p>
               <p>The gentle tones fell on the heart of the girl, and the sullen look was exchanged for one of a milder aspect.</p>
               <p>"I will try to keep him asleep, ma'am," said she, in a pleasant voice, as Emily turned away. Truly, "a soft answer turneth away wrath; but grievous words stir up anger."</p>

               <p>"I HAVE been thinking, father," said Emily, looking up from her plate, at which she had been abstractedly gazing for some time, "that I would like to engage as teacher in a boarding-school, if you are willing."</p>
               <p>"Ah! that reminds me of something I ought to have mentioned to you before, Emily," said her father. "Mr. Ross called at the office to-day, and wished me to ask you, if you would accept a situation as governess<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6179-00000037"/> verness in the family of Mr. De Lacy, a friend of his, residing in Kentucky. The gentleman is a widower, continued Mr. Mayland; his mother resides with him, and has charge of the house. There are but two children, twins; a boy and girl, about eight or nine years old. They lost their mother when they were infants, and have been left much to the care of servants. Their father is a wealthy slaveholder; and spends but little time in the company of his children. The salary offered was a tempting one; but setting that aside, he thought that Emily might effect much good in educating and disciplining the minds of the children. He has a high opinion of you, my daughter," said Mr. Mayland, smiling, and looking at Emily." When he received his friend's letter, he said, he thought, at once, of speaking to you; as he knew of no one else so well qualified to undertake the charge. He will call on you for an answer, on next Monday morning. Think well on the subject, my daughter, before fore you decide to go. Do not consent, unless you feel perfectly willing," said Mr. Mayland, as Emily rose from the table, and left the room.</p>
               <p>She felt her mind in a perfect maze of conflicting thoughts, as she entered her own apartment, and seated herself, with her mother's Bible in her hand, endeavouring to gather counsel and instruction from its sacred pages, relative to the course she ought to pursue. At length she arose, and prepared to retire; still in an undecided state of mind. She lay thinking for a long time. She felt that she was too young and inexperienced to undertake the education of two badly trained children. She feared that she would not have patience to bear with their faults; and Mr. Ross had said, that Mr. De Lacy had a number of slaves. It would not be pleasant to live in a place where there were so many colored persons. She had never been used to their ways; and it was so far from home, she was on the point of concluding to decline<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6179-00000038"/> the situation, when the thought arose in her mind, that she might be made the instrument for good to those little ones, in guiding and directing their youthful minds in the fair paths of virtue. Was it not a work prepared for her, and should she shrink from doing her duty, wherever that duty lay? At length she fell asleep, and did not awake until late next morning.</p>
               <p>After breakfast was over, she went out. As she walked along the street, without any particular object in view, only that she thought the fresh morning air would strengthen and refresh her, her mind was filled with painful doubts.</p>
               <p>She unconsciously bent her steps toward the northern part of the city, and was passing along Green Street, when her attention was directed to a number of Friends, in their plain attire, going in at a gate, and along a walk, towards a neat building, some distance back from the street. Struck with their mild and benevolent looks, Emily felt an irresistible desire to follow them. Entering in at the door, she walked about midway of the house, and seated herself near an open window. The leaves rustled at the west wind's touch, with a cool and pleasant sound, as it playfully tossed them about, and then stole in at the window and fanned the flushed cheek of the young girl.</p>
               <p>The deep, solemn silence, that rested on all within, had a soothing effect upon the mind of Emily. She earnestly sought to still the conflicting elements within her heart, that she might be enabled to hear the still small voice of God, speaking to her spiritual understanding.</p>
               <p>After sitting for some time in silence, an old man, she had noticed in the gallery, arose. His head was whitened with the frosts of many winters, and his placid countenance spoke of peace within. He began his discourse with the following words:—</p>
               <p>"In the morning sow thy seed, and at evening<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6179-00000039"/> ning withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good."</p>
               <p>He enlarged on the necessity of always being ready to do our duty; not in our own will and way, doing this, and leaving that undone, as our pleasure or interests may direct; but, like Samuel of old, be in a state of waiting to hear what God requires; and having ascertained his will respecting us, cheerfully to obey, even as a little child does his earthly parent; leaving the consequences in his hands. We are to scatter the seed as the Lord directs, and in his own good time he will send the early and the latter rain to nourish the tender shoot, until it bursts through the earth's crust, and spreads its leaves, rejoicing in the light of Heaven. He clearly showed that most of our spiritual troubles arose from an unwillingness to act in the Lord's time, and a want of faith in his promises.</p>
               <p>After a few more remarks he sat down. Emily pondered on his words, and felt how plainly they applied to herself.</p>
               <p>Was not she, like Jonah, turning from a duty? Even as he would have escaped from preaching repentance to the sinning Ninevites, so would she ask to be excused from the performance of this work. She felt both reproved and encouraged. Reproved for her want of faith, and encouraged by the words of the good old man, to yield a ready obedience in all things required of her. Her mind now became calm and clear; and a sweet, peaceful feeling stole over her. The way that had appeared so difficult was made plain. All the troubles her imagination had raised up were removed, and she returned home with feelings widely different from those with which she had left.</p>

               <p>HER mind was now fully made up as to the course she ought to pursue, and when Mr. Ross called the next day, she at once accepted the situation.</p>
               <p>"I expect," said he, "to pay a visit to my friend; and if convenient to you to start so soon, I would like to go next Monday."</p>
               <p>Emily, who was aware how much the old gentleman disliked being disappointed in his arrangements, promised to be in readiness for the journey by that time.</p>
               <p>"I always thought you were a good, sensible sible young lady, Miss Mayland," said Mr. Ross, smiling, "and very unlike the majority of your sex. I do not mean to insinuate that all ladies are not good and sensible," said he, as with an arch look, Emily laughingly exclaimed:—</p>
               <p>"Oh! Mr. Ross, how can you be so ungallant? I fear you are flattering me, because I agreed so readily to your wishes."</p>
               <p>"No, no, Emily, I did not wish to flatter you: but only to say that you would be ready for a journey in about half the time that it takes most ladies."</p>
               <p>"I will meet you at the depot," said he, rising to go. "I think you will be pleased with your situation. The little ones are warm-hearted and affectionate. The boy has a noble spirit; but it has never been controlled, and at times he is hasty and wilful. His sister has an impatient disposition; but if they had good advice and instruction, they might be made lovely children, and such I hope to see them become under your care.<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6179-00000041"/> Good night, Miss Mayland," said he, as he closed the door.</p>
               <p>Emily was so busily engaged throughout the week that but little time was left for reflection. Mrs. Mayland, who had been more kind to Emily ever since the evening that she had taken care of little Eddie, was an efficient aid. Her active and energetic spirit overcame difficulties, as one after another they arose.</p>
               <p>"I think it will be impossible to get all those books in that box," said Emily, as she cast a despairing look at a number of volumes that lay upon the floor. "I would like to take them all. They will be of use to me."</p>
               <p>"Your large travelling trunk is quite full," said Mrs. Mayland, "and this box must hold these. Hand me the books, Emily; I will try to pack them in. There now," she added, as she laid the last one in its place, "I wonder if it will lock!"</p>
               <p>Shutting down the lid, she pressed vigorous ously upon it with both hands. The bolt sprang forward, and Mrs. Mayland's look of determination changed to one of triumph.</p>
               <p>The journey was performed without accident. The time had passed pleasantly to Emily, in listening to the agreeable conversation of Mr. Ross. He had travelled a great deal, both in the Northern and Southern States, and he drew comparisons between them that were very interesting to Emily.</p>
               <p>It was in the afternoon when our travellers neared their place of destination. Mr. De Lacy's estate lay about three miles distant from the station where they left the cars. Emily's heart trembled as the carriage turned up a broad shady way, and stopped before the elegant mansion of Mr. De Lacy.</p>
               <p>The door was opened by a coloured man, and they were ushered into a spacious hall.</p>
               <p>"Is your master at home," inquired Mr. Ross:</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," answered the man, "Mas'r's in<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6179-00000042"/> de drawin' room," and he led the way to that apartment.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy was reading as they entered; but, instantly laying down the book, he has tened to greet his old friend.</p>
               <p>"This is an unexpected pleasure," said he, cordially shaking Mr. Ross' hand.</p>
               <p>"This is Mr. De Lacy, Miss Mayland," said the old gentleman, turning to Emily.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy bowed gracefully to the embarrassed girl, handed her to a seat, inquired relative to their journey, and rang the bell. In a few minutes a middle-aged coloured woman made her appearance.</p>
               <p>"Show Miss Mayland to her room, Aunt Rose, and see that her wishes are attended to. She feels, I have no doubt, much fatigued after her long journey."</p>
               <p>"Dis way, if yer please, Miss," said the woman in a respectful tone, as she led the way to a large and handsomely furnished apartment.</p>
               <p>"Dis yer is your room, and thar is yer trunks. Let me help yer off with your travelling dress, Miss. "You look tired, poor chile," said the sympathizing voice of Aunt Rose. "You feel lonesome like, being so far from home."</p>
               <p>The touching kindness of voice and manner was too much for the gentle girl. Her eyes filled with tears, and her voice trembled as she thanked Aunt Rose for her assistance. She felt at that moment as if she could have thrown her arms around the neck of the kind-hearted woman, and wept upon her bosom. With an effort, she calmed her feelings, and commenced unpacking one of her trunks. As she arose from her kneeling position on the floor, Aunt Rose handed her a chair.</p>
               <p>"Now jest set down in dis yer chair, Miss, and I will braid yer har. Thar—that'll do," said she, a few minutes afterwards, as she gave a finishing touch or two.</p>
               <p>"How do yer like it?" and she wheeled the chair in front of a dressing-glass. Emily did like it very much, and expressed her<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6179-00000043"/> thanks to the delighted Aunt Rose, who prided herself on her proficiency in the art of hair-dressing.</p>
               <p>"Now, Miss," said she, when Emily's toilet had been completed, "Yer'd better take dis seat by de winder, and rest yerself. When de tea bell rings I'll come and let yer know," said thoughtful Aunt Rose, as she left the room.</p>
               <p>The window at which Emily was sitting looked out upon a spacious garden, where roses of all varieties, and numerous other plants and flowers grew in beautiful luxuriance. A fountain threw its tiny jets in the air, which descended in spray upon the ferns and lilies that surrounded it. Altogether the scene was one that bespoke the master of the estate to be a person of highly cultivated taste.</p>
               <p>Emily had scarcely noticed the personal appearance of Mr. De Lacy, when he was introduced to her; only that he was a tall dark-complexioned gentleman, with rather a scornful ful expression of countenance, as it seemed to her. She was not just now thinking of Mr. De Lacy, though; but of a beautiful little bird, that had perched himself on the topmost bough of a tree, which stood near the window, and was swelling his little throat in strains of melody.</p>
               <p>Emily was intently watching his motions, as he gracefully turned his pretty head from side to side, and did not notice Aunt Rose, as she entered the room, and approached to her side.</p>
               <p>"Tea is ready, Miss," and Emily started, for that was the first intimation she had of the woman's presence. She arose, and in some trepidation followed Aunt Rose down stairs.</p>
               <p>"Here are your pupils, Miss Mayland," said Mr. De Lacy, as she entered the room. "My son William," said he, with something of pride in his tone, as a handsome boy approached, who made a bow, and whistled to his dog at the same moment.</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6179-00000044"/>
               <p>His father bit his lips in vexation at the want of politeness in his son and heir. He was in the act of reproving him for his rudeness, as his daughter came to his side.</p>
               <p>"Ah! here is my little Ella, the pet and darling of our household," said her father, looking fondly on the beautiful child, who, with touching innocence and simplicity put her little arms around the neck of her Governess, and affectionately kissed her.</p>
               <p>Emily felt herself quickly drawn toward the fair child, and thought that it would not be a difficult task to love one of her pupils at least. Ella's sweet smile, and winning manner in some degree made amends for her brother's rude behaviour.</p>
               <p>"William was pleased to see Nep, papa," she whispered apologetically; "he has been looking for him this long while, and could not find him." She was interrupted in her explanation by the entrance of Mrs. De Lacy.</p>
               <p>"Here is Miss Mayland, grandma," said Ella, running up to her; and taking her hand led her to where Emily was standing.</p>
               <p>Mrs. De Lacy was a tall sallow-complex-ioned lady, with large black eyes, that had once, no doubt, been handsome; but now they had a lustreless expression. She greeted Emily in a cold, indifferent tone of voice that chilled the heart of the young girl. Ella, with a grace and politeness of manner that seemed natural to her, looked pained at the coldness of her grandmother; and taking the hand of Emily, she led her toward the table, at which Mrs. De Lacy was already seated.</p>
               <p>"Grandma always sits there," observed Ella, "and papa here between William and me. You will sit here, on this side by me, will you not, Miss Mayland?"</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy smiled, shook his head at his loquacious little daughter, and asked her if she did not observe that she was standing in Miss Mayland's way. Ella blushed, asked to be excused, and took her seat between her papa and Emily.</p>

               <p>AFTER tea they sat in the verandah; the day had been warm, and now as the evening breeze came laden with the perfume of many flowers, it was delightful to sit there and listen to the cool plashing of the fountain. Emily was enjoying all this, as little Ella came to her, and putting her hand in that of her governess, asked her to go with her, and see her bed of roses.</p>
               <p>"They are very pretty, I assure you," said the child, as Emily arose to accompany her. "I will gather you some of the sweetest. Are you fond of flowers, Miss Mayland?" asked Ella, as if in doubt whether her proffered gift would be acceptable.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Ella, I am very fond of flowers, and roses in particular; they are my favourites."</p>
               <p>"Then you will be pleased with mine," said the delighted child.</p>
               <p>Just then master William made his appearance, and came running to meet them.</p>
               <p>"Do, Miss Mayland," said he, "come and see my white rabbits; they are real beauties, I tell you. I make Sam take first rate care of them. But where are you going," he said, as they turned in a different direction from that which led to where he wished them to go.</p>
               <p>"Miss Mayland is going to see my roses," said his sister. "I have promised to gather her some, she is very fond of them," added the child, in a confident tone.</p>
               <p>"No, no, never mind the roses, Ellie, said her brother, in an impatient voice. Miss<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6179-00000046"/> Mayland can see them some other time, I want her to see my rabbits now."</p>
               <p>"Suppose, William, we go and see the flowers first, and then call on our way back to see the rabbits; the little fellows will all be out; they like to play in the evening," said Emily in a pleasant voice. "You will go with me to see Ella's roses, will you not," she asked, holding out her hand to the boy. For a moment he hesitated, and then came forward and took the proffered hand.</p>
               <p>Emily made the walk very interesting to the children, by explaining to them the properties and uses of many of the plants and flowers they passed, and relating to them an amusing story of a tame rabbit that had learned to perform wonderful tricks.</p>
               <p>The twins were delighted with the account, and William wished that he owned one as clever.</p>
               <p>"Here they are," exclaimed Ella, as they came within sight of the little animals, who were leaping and scampering in all directions tions, within the enclosure, which looked very neat and clean. A colored boy was gathering salad, a little distance off.</p>
               <p>"Don't I keep them nice?" said William.</p>
               <p>"I thought you said, quietly observed Emily, that Sam kept them in such nice order for you?"</p>
               <p>The boy looked up in astonishment, but, without appearing to notice him, she continued,—</p>
               <p>"He must take pains to keep them so, for they require a great deal of care. He must be a neat, orderly boy."</p>
               <p>"William's eyes fell before Emily's glance; his understanding was quick, and he felt her mild rebuke. He was not disposed to be angry, for he already felt that his governess was one whose approbation he would like to gain.</p>
               <p>As they turned from the enclosure, a tall, powerful-looking negro, met them. There was something in his appearance that arrested the notice of Emily; a certain mild,<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6179-00000047"/> dignity of manner, that is only to be met with in persons whose minds have been disciplined by the power of religion. He lifted his hat respectfully as he approached, and held it in his hand until he was quite past. Noticing Emily's look of interest, William observed,—</p>
               <p>"That is Scipio, a slave of papa's. I have heard papa say, that grandpa bought him in Cuba, a long time ago. Scipio was about fourteen years old, when grandpa got him; he bought him to take care of papa, who was then a little boy like me, and when he was married, and came here, he brought Scipio along with him. I heard grandpa say that his father was brought from Africa; that he was a prince there. He was taken prisoner by another tribe, and sold to a captain of a slave vessel, who brought him to Cuba, where he married, and Scipio was the eldest of several children. Grandpa said," continued William, "that he grieved for a long time after his parents, and little brothers and sisters. He got a good home; I wonder what made him grieve," said the child, thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"Would you be happy, William, if you were taken from your father and sister, and pleasant home, and placed among strangers, even if they were kind to you?" inquired Emily.</p>
               <p>"Oh! no," said William, quickly, "I would never go away from my home, among strangers; but Scipio was a slave, you know, and must have expected to have to leave his home."</p>
               <p>"But that did not make the separation any easier for him to bear, my child; and most likely, he then knew nothing about slavery," replied Emily. "Poor child! how lonely he must have felt," she added, musingly.</p>
               <p>"Do you think grandpa did right, in bringing Scipio away from his home?" asked Ella, seriously.</p>
               <p>That was a close question, and Emily<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6179-00000048"/> scarce knew how to answer, but she felt that she must say something to satisfy the child. She could not say that she thought he did rightly, for she was of an entirely different opinion. After a moment's reflection she said,—</p>
               <p>"Perhaps, if your grandpa had not bought him, he might have got a cruel master, and been badly treated."</p>
               <p>"Then, I am glad grandpa got him," said Ella.</p>
               <p>Emily thought that grandpa was far from right in holding his fellow creatures in bondage at all; but she kept her thoughts to herself, hoping in time to impress the minds of her pupils with such clear ideas of right and wrong, that they would see the inconsistency and wickedness of the system themselves; and she resolved to sow good seed in the morning of their lives, trusting that, in time, it would bear fruit abundantly.</p>

               <p>WE will now pass over an interval of six months. Emily had earnestly sought to guide and instruct her pupils aright. At times she felt encouraged, and again, she almost despaired of ever seeing her work perfected as she wished. Of late, however, they were much more docile and obedient. Ella was evidently in earnest, trying to overcome her impatient spirit, and William was less hasty, and more willing to take advice. Both were warmly attached to Emily, and for this reason she had more influence over them than she otherwise could have exerted.</p>
               <p>It chanced, one afternoon about this time,<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6179-00000049"/> that Emily was sitting in her room, and overheard Ella calling to Aunt Rose from the landing, at the head of the stairs, to come up and dress her.</p>
               <p>"Will yer please wait one minute, Miss Ella?" replied Aunt Rose from the back porch,—whither she had gone with her ironing-table to escape the heat of the kitchen range. "I am jest finishin' ironin' yer white dress; de one with lace trimmin' on de sleeves, and den I shall have got through with me work. Dis yer dress of your'n is de last piece."</p>
               <p>Ella was annoyed at being asked to wait, and was about interrupting Aunt Rose's explanation with a peremptory order to come at once, when she recollected herself. The thought of how nearly she had given way to her impatience humbled her at once; and answering, in gentle tones, she could wait until she had finished her work, walked thoughtfully to her room. Taking her little Bible, she sat down to read. As she turned over the leaves, her eye fell on this passage: "He that ruleth his own spirit, is greater than he that taketh a city.</p>
               <p>She had just read the verse, when Aunt Rose came into the room, with the dress on her arm. She looked warm and tired. Ella felt glad that she had not hurried her.</p>
               <p>"Oh! Aunt Rose, how beautifully you have ironed my dress! But you look tired, said the child in a voice of pity. Sit down, and rest awhile, before you dress me.</p>
               <p>"Yer a dear, good chile, Miss Ella," said Aunt Rose, gratefully, "but I hab bin used to hard work all me life, I don't mind it. Please to sot down in dis cheer, and let me curl yer har."</p>
               <p>Ella took the seat, and Aunt Rose began her task.</p>
               <p>The passage she had been reading when she was interrupted by the entrance of her nurse, came again into her mind. She did not clearly understand it.</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6179-00000050"/>
               <p>"When I am dressed," thought she, "I will go to Miss Mayland, and ask her to explain it to me, if she is at leisure."</p>
               <p>Accordingly, as soon as Aunt Rose had finished, she took her Bible, and went to Emily's room, and knocked gently at the door; a cheerful voice bade her enter.</p>
               <p>"What difficult text has been puzzling my little Ella," said Emily, as she noticed the open book in the child's hand.</p>
               <p>"Please explain this passage for me, dear Miss Mayland," and Ella pointed with her finger to the verse.</p>
               <p>"I would rather you would read it to me, my dear," said Emily. Ella slowly read aloud the passage.</p>
               <p>"What is there in that, my little girl does not understand? I think the verse explains itself sufficiently."</p>
               <p>"I think," said the child, hesitating, "that the man who could take a city would be a great person; don't you, Miss Mayland?"</p>
               <p>"Probably the world might think him so, but the Bible tells us that he who rules his own spirit aright is the greater of the two."</p>
               <p>"Is it a great trial to conquer one's self," said the child.</p>
               <p>"Was it a trial for you not to give way to your own impatient temper, Ella, when you wished Aunt Rose to come and dress you, and she asked you to wait a little while?"</p>
               <p>Ella colored. She was not aware that she had been overheard by her governess; but, after a moment's pause, she answered frankly,—</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed, Miss Mayland, it was very hard. I was on the point of bidding her leave the ironing, and come at once, when I thought of what you said to William and me the other day, and I resolved to wait patiently."</p>
               <p>"That was a good resolution, Ella; the next time it will be easier to yield your will for the comfort or benefit of others. Ever be watchful over all your thoughts and actions; and ask your Heavenly Father for strength<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6179-00000051"/> to enable you to overcome your faults. You understand the verse now, don't you, Ella?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, perfectly. Thank you, dear Miss Mayland," said the child, as she left the room."</p>
               <p>Emily felt much encouragement from this little incident. The good seed she had so patiently endeavoured to sow in little Ella's heart, was, by the blessing of God, springing into life and beauty. It was evident to Emily, that she was now trying to act from principle,—not mere impulse. That is not the only instance Emily witnessed, that afternoon, of the good effects of her counsels.</p>
               <p>It chanced, after tea, that she was walking on the lawn in front of the house. William was playing with his dog, a little way off. It happened that, in turning the corner of the house, he ran with some violence against Scipio, who was on his way toward the kitchen, with a large sack of something that appeared to be very heavy. Although William was not at all hurt, yet his hasty temper per instantly rose, and quickly raising the stick he held in his hand, was about to strike the unoffending black, when he felt some one touch his arm, and, looking up, he encountered the eyes of his governess fixed upon him in sorrow and surprise. That gentle look at once subdued him,—for he tenderly loved Emily,—and his eyes, and the uplifted stick, fell at the same time.</p>
               <p>"I am sure, said Emily, that Scipio did not mean to hurt you, William."</p>
               <p>"No! dat I didn't, Miss," said the slave.</p>
               <p>"I tried to step out of Massa William's way, but dis yer sack is so heavy, dat I couldn't move quick enough. I hope young Massa's not much hurt," continued the black, looking at William.</p>
               <p>"No, Scipio, I am not hurt," answered the boy. "I'm glad I did not strike you. It was I that ran against you," said he, quickly.</p>
               <p>"Oh! neber mind dat, Massa William," said Scipio, kindly, as he slowly passed on with his heavy burden.</p>
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6179-00000052"/>
               <p>"Tears came into the little boy's eyes, and looking down, he said, almost despairingly, "I shall never be what you would like to see me, or as you would wish me to be, Miss Mayland. I thought that I had nearly conquered my hasty temper; but you see I have not," he added, frankly.</p>
               <p>"Can you recite those verses to me that you admired so much the other day, William? You said that you intended committing them to memory."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! not yet, Miss Mayland. You know I only commenced learning them day before yesterday, and there are fourteen long verses. Don't you remember you advised me to learn one verse every day?" said William.</p>
               <p>"Then it will require time and patience before you will be able to repeat it all perfectly," said Emily. "Do you think you will ever succeed in doing so?"</p>
               <p>"Why, yes," answered William; "I mean to try and learn a verse every day, as you wished me to, Miss Mayland."</p>
               <p>"Well, William, can you not, also, try every day to overcome your hasty temper? You cannot do it all at once, my child: it is like learning a task; it must be accomplished little by little. I can see a great improvement in you already," said Emily, in a tone of encouragement.</p>
               <p>"William's eyes brightened; he felt confident that his governess really thought what she was saying, and he inwardly resolved to struggle on, day by day, to overcome his besetting sin. Whenever he succeeded in restraining his temper, he was rewarded, not only by an approving conscience, but also by the smiles of his governess; and he had learned to value both.</p>

               <p>ONE Sabbath morning, a few days after these occurrences, Emily and the children were in the school-room, as it was generally termed by the family. It was a large apartment, handsomely fitted up for the use of Emily and her pupils. One of its doors opened on the verandah, and near this the young girl was seated, with her mother's Bible in her hand. Little Ella stood by her side, with her curly head nestled on Emily's shoulder. William was seated at her feet, with one arm thrown across her lap; his hair pushed back from his broad fair forehead, and his eyes raised to Emily's face with an expression of deep attention. She was reading to the children the Mosaic account of the Creation.</p>
               <p>There was another auditor of whom Emily was entirely unconscious, leaning against a pillar of the verandah. A short distance from the door stood Mr. De Lacy; he had walked out of his study, the door of which also opened on the verandah, and hearing some one reading aloud in the school-room, drew near. He was at first tempted to listen,—not to the account she was reading, but to the sweetness and flexibility of her voice. At length his attention was aroused, by the grand and majestic ideas, conveyed in the most simple language. The force and beauty of the description had never struck him with such power before.</p>
               <p>Emily had just read the words, "And God said, Let there be light, and there was light,"—when suddenly before his mind arose a scene of wild confusion.</p>
               <p>Amid thick clouds and darkness, were<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6179-00000054"/> heard discordant sounds from unformed elements, that rushed together in tumultuous conflict. Amid all this strife was heard the all-powerful voice of Jehovah, proclaiming, "Let there be light," and at his mandate the heights of heaven to the farther bounds of all creation were gladdened with the presence of the glorious light. Darkness shrank back at its approach, and the warring elements stood in mute wonder at a thing so fair. His mind pursued the subject. Day by day some new wonder of the Creator's power appeared, until the work was finished, and pronounced perfect by unerring wisdom. Now the wild waves of ocean toss and fret within their prescribed limits; yearning to overleap the barriers built by the Almighty's word, and again rush lawless through space.</p>
               <p>He beheld the starry hosts as they moved in their appointed spheres, in perfect order; no jarring sound was heard, to mar the harmony of that countless multitude. Anon the earth smiled in verdure dressed. Trees, plants, and flowers, beautified its surface; and the air was vocal with myriads of delightful sounds. Last of all created things, man came into existence. Created in the image of his Maker, and endowed with an immortal soul, capable of holding communion with Deity. Yet in the possession of all the blessings that an indulgent Creator had bestowed, man only, disobeyed his will, and fell from his perfect state.</p>
               <p>To the mind of Mr. De Lacy, the thought was an humbling one. His thoughts had never before dwelt on the depravity of man in his fallen state, and in his heart he upbraided the weakness of our first parents in lending a listening ear to the deceitful whispers of the tempter. His soul was too much filled with self-love and pride to receive the instructions that the account so beautifully conveys.</p>
               <p>Although his mind was in some degree awakened to a sense of his condition, yet all was in an unformed state. He had never<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6179-00000055"/> sought for the light of truth, to illumine the darkness of his mind. Talented and highly educated himself, he did not realize that he was blind and deaf to the only knowledge that had power to confer real happiness: but he was more thoughtful than formerly, and oftener sought the company of Emily, in whose society he began to feel a decided interest.</p>
               <p>There was an elevated style and purity of sentiment in Emily's conversation, that was entirely different from those butterflies of fashion that he constantly met with at the various places of amusement he was in the habit of frequenting. He insensibly drew comparisons between her and several ladies of his acquaintance; and certainly the decision was not unfavorable to our little governess. There was, at times, a playfulness of manner about Emily, that was irresistible. She never was trifling in her remarks, nor indulged in what is generally termed small talk,—a kind of conversation, if we may dignify it by that name, that is frequently resorted to in fashionable society.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy particularly admired the gentle gracefulness with which Emily yielded to others, when it did not involve the giving up of her principles. In that case she could be firm enough, as he had cause to know in more than one instance.</p>
               <p>He had never before, seen any one whose every action was guided by Christianity. He could not then, understand the simple faith, that rests on the Lord, and fears no evil. It was not long before Mr. De Lacy's admiration of the fair girl grew into respect and esteem. As he became acquainted with the child-like simplicity and beauty of her character, it gradually ripened into a warmer feeling.</p>
               <p>But how was it with Emily? Did no feelings but those of respect for Mr. De Lacy, find a dwelling-place in her heart? None that she was aware of. She was not conscious that the color deepened on her cheek,<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6179-00000056"/> and her eyes lighted, when she heard his step, or even at the mention of his name. Her evenings, at first, were oftentimes lonely. The twins were accustomed to retiring early, and Mrs. De Lacy seldom sat in the parlor after tea. Indeed she more frequently chose to take that meal in her own room, where she was waited on by a favourite slave. When she did make her appearance in the evening, she seldom conversed with Emily. Her cold and haughty manner was a barrier to their becoming acquainted with each other. Emily always felt reserved and chilled in her presence. Perhaps, if she could have felt differently, Mrs. De Lacy would have become more interested in her. But Emily could not complain of want of company now. Unless attending to business, Mr. De Lacy was almost always at home in the evening. His graceful manners and interesting conversation won the heart of the gentle girl, unknown to herself. She did not think, as those evenings passed away in pleasant talk, how every look and tone of his was twining itself around her heart, and link by link was forming a chain that with all her efforts she could never break assunder.</p>

               <p>THE task of educating her little pupils was now a delightful one to Emily. She had gained their confidence and love.</p>
               <p>A few months ago disputes and contentions were of frequent occurrence—all was now peace and gentleness. Aunt Rose was fain to declare, that "Miss Emily was a rale blessing to de house, and dat she'd made de chillen jest like lambs."</p>
               <p>Emily had been an inmate of Mr. De Lacy's house almost a year, and had given entire satisfaction to all parties concerned. The children advanced rapidly in their studies. She heard frequently from home, and her father's letters of late had been of a nature to make her feel at ease relating to him. He had come into possession of a considerable amount of property, by the legacy of an old uncle, who had spent many years abroad. She remembered having heard her father speak of him as one of those restless spirits who wander from one place to another, and never settle permanently anywhere. Her father spoke of her coming home, if she desired it; but she knew her absence was more agreeable to Mrs. Mayland. Another weighty reason was, that she could not think of leaving her little pupils; she felt that her mission was not yet accomplished.</p>
               <p>It chanced, one evening, that Mr. De Lacy was walking in the garden, enjoying the delightful breeze, and gazing at the moon beams that trembled on the tiny ripples of the basin that surrounded the fountain, or were brightly reflected on the jetting streams. He had been standing quite still for a few moments, when his attention was attracted by hearing the voices of his children; and looking<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6179-00000058"/> ing in the direction from which the sounds proceeded, he saw the twins walking along, and busily engaged talking to each other.</p>
               <p>Ella carried a small basket in one hand, and the other was clasped in William's. They were attended by Scipio, and going in the direction of a long row of dilapidated frame buildings, known as "the quarters."</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy wondered within himself what the children's errand was there, at that time in the evening—and he resolved to follow them unobserved. They had arrived within a short distance of the place when they were interrupted by the sudden appearance of a man who stepped from behind a tree, and placed himself directly in their way.</p>
               <p>The person who thus unceremoniously intruded his company, was no less a person than Mr. Seth Jenks, their father's overseer. He was a man of most unprepossessing appearance, being tall and spare, with sandy hair and whiskers, that seldom made the accquaintance of comb or brush. He had little gray eyes, that had a malignant glare in them, and a freckled, pimpled skin.</p>
               <p>He was an unworthy son of New York, and for reasons best known to himself had disappeared from that city rather mysteriously. He had travelled through most of the Southern and Western States, in various capacities, and at length had chanced to find his way to the estate of Mr. De Lacy, and had been fortunate enough to be hired as overseer by that gentleman, at a handsome salary.</p>
               <p>"Good evenin', young Miss, and Master De Lacy," he said in a cracked voice, that rather startled the timid Ella, "Goin' to the quarters, eh?" said he interrogatively, as he noticed the basket the little girl carried.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, answered William."</p>
               <p>"Wa'll, I'm sorry, but ye can't go to-night, it's agin orders. Who sent you?" he suddenly inquired. "Did your pa?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir," said Ella, speaking for the first time since her eyes had fallen on this disagreeable<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6179-00000059"/> greeable object. "Papa did not know of our coming here; we asked Miss Mayland to let us take a basket of fruit and cakes to old mother Judy. She has the care of the little children while their mothers are at work in the fields, you know; and she gave us permission to go this evening, if Scipio had time to accompany us."</p>
               <p>"Wall, jest go back and tell yer governess that it's again yer pa's orders for any one from the house to go to the quarters in the evenin'."</p>
               <p>Here Scipio was about to speak, when the everseer turned upon him so fiercely, that Ella was terrified, and clung tightly to the arm of her brother.</p>
               <p>It may not be out of place here to state the cause of Mr. Jenks' unwillingness to have the children visit the quarters that evening, for certainly Mr. De Lacy had never given any such orders, nor had prohibited any one from going thither whenever they wished. He very seldom went there himself self,—leaving the care of the field hands entirely to his overseer.</p>
               <p>He knew that he raised fine crops, and that his farm lands were kept in perfect order; but he did not know that his slaves were half starved, hard worked, and cruelly treated at all times. He had never taken the trouble to see to those things for himself. He allowed grain and meat sufficient for their use, but Mr. Jenks had contrived to carry on a system of retrenchment, that was very disadvantageous to the blacks, but quite advantageous to himself, and that was the main-spring of all Mr. Jenks' actions.</p>
               <p>Whatever could be saved from the slaves' allowance—both of grain and meat mdash;was sold to a man that had a grocery and provision store about two miles from Mr. De Lacy's estate, who in his turn parted with it to the poor whites in the neighbourhood, at a considerable profit to himself. This evening the last of the harvest had been safely housed.</p>
               <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6179-00000060"/>
               <p>The poor slaves had been kept at work until very late, and they were now engaged in cooking their scanty repast. In order to push work faster, the overseer had ordered all hands to the fields, and that day had taken even poor old Judy, who had long since been considered unfit for hand work.</p>
               <p>With all these reasons weighing upon his mind, Mr. Jenks was particularly anxious to keep visitors away from the quarters on this particular evening. But the children were pleased with the prospect of the delight of Mother Judy at sight of the nice things in the basket, and not at all inclined to turn back.</p>
               <p>"Let the children pass on, Mr. Jenks," said Mr. De Lacy, who, unexpected by all parties, suddenly made his appearance to the dismay and confusion of the overseer, who started, changed color, stammered out something intended for an excuse, and stepped back from the path.</p>
               <p>"Oh! papa," exclaimed the twins, delighted at sight of their father, "we are going to see old Mother Judy. Please do go with us; it would be so pleasant," said the children.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jenks looked as if it would be the reverse of agreeable to him, but remained silent.</p>
               <p>"Go back to the house, Scipio, and tell Miss Mayland that the children are with me," said Mr. De Lacy, quietly, as he proceeded after the little ones.</p>
               <p>"Wall," muttered the overseer, "now if that ain't a little too mean of De Lacy to go to the quarters to-night, of all others. The niggers are skeercer of eatin' stuff than common. I calkalated to take Nubbens a lot of corn and meat to-morrow, so as to make up the quantity he wants. I've had to keep 'em rather short this while past. It's too bad. I wish them young un's of his'n had jest kept their mouths shet. If it hadn't been for them, he'd never thought of goin'," he growled savagely. Then, as if a sudden thought had struck him, he exclaimed, while<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6179-00000061"/> his eyes glared with a tigerish expression, "I wonder if that old black elephant hasn't been talkin'. He'd better look straight," he said, as he gazed after the retreating form of Scipio. "I'll keep an eye skinned, and if I ketch him lookin' round arter me, I'll give him a settler, that'll put him past preachin' for awhile. I must get that stuff off to the store airly in the mornin;" he muttered, as he strode off in the direction of the barn.</p>

               <p>WHILE Mr. Jenks was maturing his plans, Mr. De Lacy and the twins had arrived at the quarters. A considerable time had elapsed since he had been there, and the place, to him, had a most wretched and dilapidated appearance. The full moon shone brightly from an almost unclouded sky, and enabled the master to see the comfortless abodes of his slaves. It appeared to him, that he had never seen the place look so dirty and neglected before. Perhaps his feelings were different, and he<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6179-00000062"/> saw with other eyes; but be that as it may, he at once came to the conclusion that they should be cleaned and repaired. He would speak to Jenks about it in the morning.</p>
               <p>These thoughts were passing through his mind when he heard his son calling him. Walking forward, he drew near to a group of his slaves, who were standing around a fire, over which a pot was hanging. It had been kindled in front of one of the cabins, but it appeared, (if one may judge from the hungry faces gathered around it,) that it contained the supper for all the group.</p>
               <p>"Just look here, papa," exclaimed his indignant son; "here in this pot, I mean. This is all they have for supper, all these, and they have been out in the fields hard at work all day too, and have just now got ready to prepare something to eat. It's a shame," he said energetically.</p>
               <p>"Poor old mother Judy had to go out to work to-day, and leave the little children to get along as best they could," said Ella. "See the poor things are crying for their suppers now. You did not wish her to go, did you, papa?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"I did not know any thing about it, my dear," answered her father. "Mr. Jenks has the care of the field hands, you know. There must be waste here," he continued, "for I allow a sufficient quantity of grain and meat for all to have enough. How is it?" he muttered to himself. "They do looked starved, and dejected."</p>
               <p>"Here, Polly," said he, speaking to a brightlooking mulatto woman, who was passing towards one of the huts, "Why don't you clean up here. You used to be very tidy about your house." The woman paused, looked around fearfully, and spoke in a low tone:</p>
               <p>"We never get no time now, Mas'r," and hurried into the house, as if afraid of being seen.</p>
               <p>I must inquire into this, thought Mr. De Lacy. Jenks keeps the land in first-rate order, but the people look as if they had been<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6179-00000063"/> badly treated. It's strange if they don't get enough to eat. I always thought that Jenks was careful enough of the hands.</p>
               <p>"Sam," said the master suddenly to a tall, slender young black man, who was peering into the pot with intense interest, seeming to enjoy the bubbling and seething of its contents, "Are you hungry, boy?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, mas'r," answered the black.</p>
               <p>"Don't you get enough to eat?" questioned Mr. De Lacy.</p>
               <p>"Mars'r Jenks allers gibs us our 'lowance ebery week," said Sam, evasively.</p>
               <p>"How much does he give you," said his master?"</p>
               <p>"What he tinks we can get along with," said the slave, still regarding the aforesaid pot.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy was not much enlightened with Sam's answers—the man evidently did not intend to commit himself, and thereby bring down the savage wrath of the overseer upon his head.</p>
               <p>Finding that he was not likely to gain any satisfactory information from the wily black, he turned to where mother Judy was sitting, surrounded by five or six children, from the ages of two years, downward. The almost naked little ones were rolling, kicking, and endeavouring to climb into her lap, while Ella and William stood near, laughing heartily at the comic scene. The old woman was holding the basket that Ella had brought her, at arm's length, and talking and scolding with great energy, whilst she endeavoured to keep the hungry little creatures off her lap.</p>
               <p>"Can't yer stay down, I tell yer," said she, as she arose to her feet, and let them roll, most unceremoniously, on the ground, "how am I to get de tings out ob de basket with all yer on me lap. Do keep quiet now, and give a body a chance. Yer'll all git some d'rectly. I declar' I'se so tired I ken hardly move at all. Dar now," she added, as the last cake was distributed, "I hopes yer'll eat, and let me rest awhile."</p>
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6179-00000064"/>
               <p>"But you have not saved any for yourself, mother Judy," said William.</p>
               <p>"De poor little tings wanted dem worse den I did," said the kind-hearted old woman, "da'r not used to goin' without eatin' so long as dey had to, to-day."</p>
               <p>The twins felt respect and admiration for the conduct of the poor old slave. They knew that both cakes and fruit were a treat to her, yet she voluntarily, and without complaint gave them all to the hungry children.</p>
               <p>"Mother Judy, why don't you give these children something to eat before this time in the evening," said Mr. De Lacy, when the noise had abated.</p>
               <p>"I'se jest got in from de field, Mas'a," answered old Judy, frankly, for she was not one of those that feared overseers, or any one else. She had been wroth and chafed inspirit all day, at being compelled to do a kind of work that, on account of her age, she had long been exempt from.</p>
               <p>"Poor critters, dey be a'most starved, and de good Lord only knows when dey would hab got any ting, if Miss Ella and Massa William had not been so good and kind as to bring dis yer basket full ob cakes and peaches. Dere not got enough yet," she added, in a vexed tone. "I neber gets enough for dem now, dese yere times; dat's what makes dem look so starved like. I takes all de care I can ob dem, de little tings," she muttered, in an undertone, "dey would 'scape a great deal of trouble, if de Lord would take dem all to hisself fore dey growed up."</p>
               <p>While the old woman was thus soliloquizing, Mr. De Lacy and the twins had returned to the group around the fire.</p>
               <p>The pot was about being taken from its place, and all hands were engaged in getting things ready, each to receive his share.</p>
               <p>"Silence, boys," said the master, authoritatively, to several men who were at that moment disputing in loud tones. "Silence, all—and listen to me. This day is the last<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6179-00000065"/> of the harvest. To-morrow you can have to yourselves: no work is to be done, only the care of the stock. You shall take your dinner on the lawn."</p>
               <p>As he ceased speaking, one universal shout arose from the slaves, mingled with blessings on their master, for this unlooked for indulgence.</p>
               <p>"Oh! papa, how glad they were," said little Ella, joyfully, as they were returning home.</p>
               <p>"I'm so pleased you thought of giving them a holiday," said William; "they looked so tired, poor things."</p>
               <p>"Dear Miss Mayland," said the twins, both speaking at once, in their haste to impart the the good news, "what do you think? Papa has given the people a whole day to themselves. To-day is the last of the harvest, you know."</p>
               <p>Now, it happened that Emily knew nothing of the kind. But she rejoiced with the happy children, in the prospect of a day's leisure for the overworked slaves. Her heart had often bled for them, when in her walks she had chanced to meet one of their number, whose half-starved appearance and tattered garments awoke her sympathy.</p>
               <p>"The people will dance in the evening," said Ella; "they always do, when they have a holiday. Will you go with papa and us to see them?</p>
               <p>Emily hesitated; but before she had formed a reply, Mr. De Lacy came to her side.</p>
               <p>"Say that you will accompany us, Miss Mayland; the children will not enjoy themselves so much, if you are absent."</p>
               <p>Neither would he, he might have added; but his eyes spoke that in unmistakable language.</p>
               <p>"Some of the dances are quite curious," he said., "No doubt they have been handed down through generations, from the slaves brought from Africa."</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy remained in the parlor only a short time, before he arose, kissed the<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6179-00000066"/> twins, and bidding Emily good night, retired to his room.</p>
               <p>"I must pay more attention to the hands than I have been doing of late. I have left them almost entirely to the care of Jenks. I thought he was a good overseer; but there is something wrong in his management, or I'm mistaken. I'll see to it in the morning," were his last thoughts as he fell asleep.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the careful Mr. Jenks was busily engaged until late in the evening, bestowing his unlawfully obtained provender in sacks and bags, ready to be taken away early in the morning. Accordingly, before the sun had risen, he was again at the barn, had loaded the wagon, geared in two stout horses, and was busy at work trying to get the tail-board in, when he heard a slight noise behind him, and turning around, came face to face with Scipio, who had that morning risen earlier than usual to attend to the horses, so that he could have more leisure time. He was entirely innocent of Mr. Jenks' suspicions concerning him, and astonished tonished at the more than usual scowl of the overseer; for he expected that gentleman would be better natured than he usually was, in prospect of a holiday. He was not aware that Mr. Jenks was yet in ignorance of that event.</p>
               <p>"What brought yer out here, you old hypocrite?" snarled the enraged overseer.</p>
               <p>"Come to feed the horses, Massa Jenks," said Scipio, mildly.</p>
               <p>"Yer lie, yer confounded old sinner, thundered the exasperated man," who fully believed that he had been watched by the slave. "I'll teach yer better than to be spyin' 'round on my doin's, yer lyin' old nigger," he exclaimed, as he seized the board that he had been trying to get in its place, and brought it down upon the head of the unfortunate bondman, who staggered backward a few paces, and fell insensible to the ground.</p>
               <p>"Now, lay thar!" he growled, savagely. "When yer git yer head cured, you'll know a nigger's place, after this.</p>

               <p>MR. JENKS was about getting in the front of the wagon, for the purpose of driving off, intending to leave the wounded man, who was still lying unconscious on the ground, when he was arrested by a voice that made him turn pale.</p>
               <p>"What has been the matter here?" sternly demanded Mr. De Lacy, who had also risen much earlier than he was wont to, and expecting to find the overseer at the barn, had come hither for the purpose of telling him that he had given the people a holiday, and also of inquiring as to the scarcity of provisions at the quarters.</p>
               <p>He was amazed at beholding the bleeding form of the prostrate Scipio, and at seeing a wagon standing ready loaded with two of his horses attached to it. His first thought was of Scipio; what had he been doing to bring upon himself such cruel punishment. He at once determined, if possible, to ascertain the truth.</p>
               <p>"What has been the matter?" he again inquired, looking full into the face of the disconcerted Mr. Jenks. "What has Scipio been doing, and what is in that wagon?"</p>
               <p>"Wall, yer see, I was jest going to drive to A—— with some things," answered the overseer,—hoping that Mr. De Lacy, with his usual indifference, would inquire no more about the contents of the wagon,—"when Sip came up and began to give me impudence 'bout the hosses. I went to strike him with a whip, when he turned on me, and in the scuffle I got hold of a piece of board and struck him on the head."</p>
               <p>"Mr. De Lacy's face lighted with a sudden expression: the whole truth of the affair at<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6179-00000068"/> once presented itself to his mind, relative to what was in the wagon.</p>
               <p>"Here, Jim," he called to a man standing on the lawn; "Tell Nero and Peter to come here directly, and you go in the house and tell Aunt Rose to come here, and bring some linen to bind up a cut."</p>
               <p>Jim ran towards the quarters, and in a few minutes the men made their appearance.</p>
               <p>"Here, boys," said Mr. De Lacy, "carry Scipio into the barn, and one of you go to the house for a bed and pillows."</p>
               <p>Then, turning to the overseer, as the men endeavoured to raise the unconscious form of the slave, he said, forcing himself to speak calmly: "I shall not need further service from you. You can leave this place without delay. If the laws of the State would reach the case, you surely should not go unpunished."</p>
               <p>"Ya'as; I know yer will's good enough, but it's mor'n yer ken do here. Now, if it had happened in New York, yer might talk of punishin', but can't do nothing here, yer see," answered Jenks, with a scornful laugh.</p>
               <p>Since all had been discovered, and himself discharged, he threw off all disguise, and showed himself in his true character.</p>
               <p>If Mr. De Lacy had not entertained such supreme contempt for the man, he might have been tempted to fell him to the ground, but simply bidding him begone, he turned on his heel, and walked into the barn, where he found Scipio lying on a bed; his head supported by Nero, while Aunt Rose was busy binding up the wounded part. He was quite conscious now, and opened his eyes as his master approached, made an effort to speak, but loss of blood had weakened him so much, that the attempt was a vain one.</p>
               <p>"Do not try to talk now, my poor fellow," said Mr. De Lacy, kindly; "some other time I will listen to the account."</p>
               <p>"Is his head badly hurt?" he asked of Aunt Rose.</p>
               <p>"It's a deep cut, massa," answered the<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6179-00000069"/> woman, "and near the temple, too. Half an inch furder and it would have finished him at once. But it has bled freely: I guess he'll be about agin in a few days. Let his head down on de piller, Nero," she said quickly, as she observed a faintness coming over him. "It's de loss ob de blood, massa," she said, as she sprinkled water plentifully on his face, "he'll come to again directly."</p>
               <p>"You had better stay awhile with him, Aunt Rose," said her master, as he left the barn.</p>
               <p>He had turned the corner, when he again came in sight of the wagon, still standing with the horses harnessed to it.</p>
               <p>"Jim," he said to the slave, who was yet lingering about the place, "ungear those horses, and put them in the field with the others."</p>
               <p>"Stay," he added, as the negro was about to obey his orders, "jump in the wagon and untie one of those sacks and tell me what is in it."</p>
               <p>Jim did as he was bidden. After a considerable time the string of one of the sacks came unfastened, and he peered carefully in.</p>
               <p>"Dere be meat in dis yer one," he said, "and corn in dat, or I'm mistaken," he added, as he felt the bag."</p>
               <p>"I thought as much," muttered Mr. De Lacy; "that rascal has been keeping the hands on short allowance and selling the overplus for his own advantage. He had his labor for his pains this time, however. I've half a mind to have him arrested for theft, and I will, if I know of his coming here again. This time perhaps he has been sufficiently punished in having to leave without his booty."</p>
               <p>"What am I to do with dese yer bags, massa," said Jim, as Mr. De Lacy turned from the wagon.</p>
               <p>"Put them in the barn for the present," answered his master, as he walked away.</p>
               <p>Let us now take a look at the disappointed Mr. Jenks. As soon as his employer had left<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6179-00000070"/> him he went to his room, and gathering his clothing into a bundle, (he did not possess a very extensive wardrobe,) he took his traps, as he technically termed such things, on his shoulder, started at once for the store of the aforesaid Nubbens, to relate to him, his (Mr. Jenks') misfortunes, and to come to some conclusion relative to what he should get at next.</p>
               <p>When he arrived at the dirty, low-roofed, building, known in the neighbourhood as Nubbens' store, he found two or three whiskey hogsheads ranged on each side of the door, forming the chief attraction to his customers. Whatever else was needed at home, the liquor must first be purchased, and the residue of their cash or produce was exchanged for tobacco and food, or perhaps a few yards of cheap dry goods. He found the owner seated on the counter, with his feet dangling, lazily knocking his heels together. He was about to twist off an enormous chew of tobacco, as he raised his eyes, and saw Mr. Jenks standing in the door-way. "Mornin', Jenks," said he, as he slid off the counter. "Yer airly. Hev' yer got the things outside?"</p>
               <p>"No," answered the overseer, gruffly; "no, I hev'n't. I b'lieve every thing's conspired agin me. Last night De Lacy tuck it into his head to visit the quarters: it was that nigger Sip's work, I thought then; and this mornin' he come spyin' round the barn, wantin' to act innocent, but he couldn't come that game over me. Guess I give him a settler for awhile, though. Then De Lacy had to come out. In common he isn't up for three hours arter that time. And when he seed Sip layin' thar, he got mad, and ordered me off. He happened to notice the wagon. I thought to put him on the wrong track, but airly risen' had made him sharp, I reckon. He'd liked to hev' skeered me with threatenin', but I happened to know the laws of Kentuck regarding niggers as well as he did, and I told him so. He looked as if he'd liked to have knocked me down; but I guess he'd found that two could play at that game;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6179-00000071"/> and now I'll tell yer what I'm goin' to do next. I'll go down to Louisiana, or some of the Gulf States, and get a situation as overseer on a sugar plantation." "Down thar," he continued, "a white man's rights are respected, and no notice taken of a nigger's talk." "Yes," he said, musingly, "I'll start to-night."</p>
               <p>Mr. Nubbens, who had resumed his seat on the counter, made no objection to this decision; he did not expect to derive any further profit from the overseer's remaining longer in the neighbourhood, and as to where he went, was a matter of indifference to him.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, the next we hear of Mr. Jenks is, that he has succeeded in obtaining the desired situation, on an extensive sugar plantation, where his brutal treatment of the wretched slaves drove some of them to make the desperate attempt to escape to an adjacent forest. It was a swampy dismal-looking place, but any place was preferable to remaining on the estate. He was in pursuit of one of these, whom he accidentally discovered, late one evening, lurking around the quarters in quest of food, and instantly gave chase, with all the ferocity and blood-thirstiness of a tiger in pursuit of prey. He rapidly gained on the fugitive, whose strength was impaired by his long fast, and was about to seize him, when the slave suddenly turned, and plunged a long-bladed knife into the breast of Jenks, who instantly fell to the ground, and died almost without a struggle.</p>
               <p>The man continued his flight, and gained a place of safety, at least for a time. It was several days before the body was found, and then they scooped a shallow grave in the damp earth, and laid the remains in it. No tear was shed, no burial service repeated, as the body was rudely consigned to its lonely resting-place. No stone marks the spot; but a cypress tree stands by it, covered with a drapery of moss, which hangs from its branches like a funeral pall, or waves in the moaning night winds, while venomous serpents<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6179-00000072"/> pents creep and twine themselves among the rank vegetation, or lie coiled, with heads erect, and glittering eyes, ready to dart upon their prey. It was a desolate spot, and seemed a fitting place to lay the remains of one, who while living had spent his time in blasting and desolating the happiness of the miserable creatures over whom he had the power.</p>

               <p>WHEN the master was informed of the death of his overseer, he, with several others, came to the resolution of ferreting out the desperate villain who committed the murder, and hanging him, or consigning him to the flames, without even the form of a trial, as a warning to other offenders.</p>
               <p>And what think you, reader? Do you pronounce him a desperate villain? Desperate he certainly was; for he was torn from wife and children without even the poor pleasure of bidding them a last farewell. Last, indeed, for henceforward they would be dead to him. In this life they would never meet again. He was brought from<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6179-00000073"/> Maryland and sold to his present master, on whose plantation Jenks was employed as overseer. He had endured the most savage treatment at the hands of that merciless man. What charm then had existence for him? Or why did he cling to life, when each day brought fresh misery? Surely it were almost kindness to strike the blow, and let the freed spirit spread its wings and rejoice in endless liberty.</p>
               <p>But brand him not with the epithet of villain, for such he was not; there was no thought of murder in his heart. He took the life of the overseer in self-defence; the love of liberty was strong within him, even as it was in our free forefathers, "who scorned to bear the paltry menace of a chain." Yes, the fire of freedom burned within that dusky bosom with as clear a light as ever it did in our revolutionary fathers' hearts. We, their children, are now enjoying the fair fruits of their liberty; and shall we refuse to raise our voices in aid of the oppressed ones of our land? No! let it be heard in trumpet tones, throughout the length and breadth of our country, until there remains not a bondman to languish beneath a tyrant's sway. Then, and not till then, will the inhabitants of this republic be entitled to the proud name of a nation of freemen. Then may the wild waves of the stormy Atlantic, that foam and dash against the rock-bound coast of New England, shout aloud in triumph to the far off Pacific, and be answered in thunder tones by its deep rolling billows, that— <q>
                     <l>"Freedom's dwelling place is here."</l>

               </p>
               <p>Then fling our country's flag to the breeze, and let the favourite bird of freedom, our own proud eagle, spread his broad wings and soar aloft, to view a people that are worthy to claim him as an emblem. Well may he droop and cling to earth, in the fair regions of the sunny South, where every breeze comes laden with the sighs and groans of outraged humanity. From the slave-raising<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6179-00000074"/> raising States of Maryland and Virginia, to the life-destroying rice-swamps of the far South, comes the sorrowful wail of broken hearts; nor are those who proudly claim to be a superior race, scarcely less enslaved in their moral and intellectual natures. All that makes man capable of self-government is held in bondage by evil passions. Is that person capable of appreciating freedom in its broadest sense, who is an advocate for a system so entirely obnoxious to liberty as American Slavery? As well might we believe a man who acted in direct violation of the principles of Christianity, and yet claimed to be a disciple of Christ, as to give credence when a man assures us that he loves liberty and yet is an advocate for the most debasing slavery. Yet blame not our Southern brethren too harshly; for when the vial of Heaven's wrath is poured out upon their guilty soil, can we of the North expect to go unpunished? If they have set up an idol, and offered sacrifice thereto, have we not been "partakers of their evil deeds," and bought and sold and trafficked in the fruits of the unrequited toil of the bondman? And now, when the unsheathed sword of justice hangs suspended over our country, and seems ready to be grasped by the hand of Jehovah, to be wielded in defence of truth and righteousness; when its keen edge strikes down the idol in his temple, and scatters his worshippers affrighted and dismayed, shall not we, too, be made to feel that as we have been partakers of their abominations, so shall we be of their punishment? <q>

               <p>But let us leave the subject for the present, and return to the home of the De Lacys.</p>
               <p>The holiday was much enjoyed by the slaves, with the exception of Scipio, who suffered severe pain in his head. Mr. De Lacy went to see him in the afternoon, and promised to visit him again in the morning. The slave was grateful for this unlooked-for kindness in the master, who was usually inattentive to the comfort of his people: but latterly he appeared more thoughtful of all around him. This day, in particular, he endeavored to make a happy one for his slaves, a plentiful dinner was spread upon the lawn, where all could partake to their satisfaction.</p>
               <p>In spite of the joyful faces with which he was surrounded, Mr. De Lacy's wore a deep shade of thoughtfulness throughout the day. At times the expression almost amounted to melancholy. Scipio had observed it, and would have asked the cause. But as his master said nothing before him upon the subject that was weighing on his mind, the slave feared to make any inquiries lest he might give offence. His kindly nature sympathized deeply, even where he knew not the cause. There was one thing he felt quite certain of—his master was unhappy. He loved Mr. De Lacy truly; he had cared for him when a child, and had been with him ever since.</p>
               <p>Scipio's mind dwelt upon the subject all the afternoon; he would have sacrificed much to see the cloud removed from his master's brow. Mr. De Lacy's thoughtful manner was also observed by Emily, particularly in the evening, when they went to see the slaves dance. Their grotesque figures called forth the merriment of the twins; their laughing questions remained unanswered, or were gravely responded<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6179-00000076"/> sponded to by their father. There was a touching sadness in his voice, that affected the heart of the gentle girl with a feeling of tenderness, and unconsciously rendered him dearer to her than ever before.</p>

               <p>THE next morning after breakfast, he took his hat and went out to see Scipio.</p>
               <p>"How does your head feel this morning?" inquired Mr. De Lacy, as he approached the slave's humble pallet.</p>
               <p>"I feel better, thank yer, mars'r: slept some last night, and my head feels more settled like."</p>
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6179-00000077"/>
               <p>"Did any one stay with you last night," inquired Mr. De Lacy.</p>
               <p>"No, mars'r; Nero offered to, but I didn't want to keep him sittin' up. Thought there was no 'casion; besides, I didn't feel alone. I had a friend with me that never tires or sleeps; he's been with me in trouble and sickness afore now, and one can neber feel lonely when Christ is present. He's better den any friend in dis world ken be, mars'r."</p>
               <p>"Do you indeed feel him to be your best friend, Scipio? How do you know that his Spirit was with you?" asked his master.</p>
               <p>"Oh! my dear mars'r, if yer had been here last night, and could hab looked right into de heart of old Scipio, yer hab seen it filled and shinin' with his glorious presence. Might I tell mars'r somethin'," said the black, looking wistfully up into Mr. De Lacy's face.</p>
               <p>"Yes, go on, Scipio," answered he quietly.</p>
               <p>"Well, mars'r, what I'm gwine to tell yer happened nigh about six years ago. About dat time I began, somehow, to feel dissatisfied fied with every thing, and mainly with myself. All the things I used to take pleasure in, sich as singin', dancin', and so on, I didn't keer for. One evenin', as I was crossin' de big field back ob de quarters, I got thinkin' ob what was de matter. I had been readin' some in de good book dat day, and I thought on de words in de chapter, until I felt dat I was a sinner in de sight of Heaven, and yet I didn't want to own up to it. De more I thought, de more miserable I felt. Dere was a mountain ob sin on my soul, that pressed it down, and when I tried to look into my heart, all was black as night. Den said I to myself—'Yer lost, Scipio!' Quick as a flash ob light came de words, 'No yer ain't, Christ ken take all dat load away, and save yer soul from ruin, if yer willin'. Well, I'm sure I wish de Lord would help me out of dis trouble, thought I; and I looked dis way and dat, for a way of escape; but I was closed in on all sides. 'Yer must be willin' to leave all things in His hands, if yer would find<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6179-00000078"/> peace,' again said the voice. Den I began to think again, I didn't want to give all right up into de Lord's hands. I kinder feared. Like de man and woman in de Bible, I wanted to keep part of my possessions back. I thought de Lord wanted too much,—mor'n I was willin' to give. 'Yer'll hev nothin' left, Scipio,' sez I to myself; and I felt tempted to turn away from de voice;—but de load ob sin pressed harder and harder, and de darkness got blacker and blacker. Den I thought de Lord might leave me for ever dat way. So I threw myself on de grass, and prayed dat de Lord would take me jest as I was, and do what he pleased with me, and dat he would give me faith to believe, and strength to perform all his requirements. At dat instant, mars'r, dat berry instant, de load all rolled away and my soul was filled with such a glorious light, I wondered how I ever could hev been afraid, or doubt. I saw now what a poor miserable critter I had been, and what a state I had been taken from. If de Lord had bid me give some things up, he had paid me mor'n double. I felt den, and I feel so still, dat out of Jesus I had nothin', and in Him I had every thing; and if he had sent for me last night, I would hab gone without fear. My soul would hab stepped out of its clay prison, spread its wings, and soared away to glory. Oh! my dear mars'r, dere is no death to those who are baptized into the life of Christ!"</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy was much affected at the simple narration of his slave. There was no doubt that he felt all he had said. No one could have looked at his face, glowing with enthusiasm, and for a moment doubt his sincerity. Mr. De Lacy did not in the least; and as he ceased speaking, he silently pressed the hand of the slave, and left the barn.</p>
               <p>"I'm glad I told mars'a," said Scipio, aloud.</p>
               <p>"I b'lieve I know what makes him look so unhappy like: he feels he's not sarvin' Christ. I wish he would be made willin'; den he'd feel what rale hap'ness is."</p>
               <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6179-00000079"/>
               <p>While these thoughts were passing through the mind of the bondman, Mr. De Lacy had walked to the foot of the garden, and seated himself under a spreading tree. His mind was filled with the account of his slave's religious experience; he felt that it had reached his case. Was not he in a similar condition? in a state of doubts and fears?—in fact in a state of unbelief? He once thought that he was a believer in the doctrines of Christ; but now, like Scipio, he felt that it was requiring more at his hands than he felt willing to yield. Yet he could not turn from the Spirit of truth and bid it depart. He felt that there was a mountain load upon his conscience, that thick clouds and darkness enveloped it, and that despair, like some gloomy bird of night, brooded upon its summit. He felt that hitherto he had served the world only; now he was called upon to turn from the worship of his idols, and serve the Lord alone.</p>
               <p>The conflict in his soul was fearful. On this side stood the Prince of the world, offering ing his treasures of gold, honor, preferment, and all that earth calls pleasure. On that side stood the Spirit of Christ, holding out to his view a bright crown of immortality. At that moment he realized the powerful truth of the saying of our Lord: "Ye cannot serve God and Mammon." For years he had bowed at the shrine of the latter, and it had brought him no substantial happiness. Its pleasures were fleeting, its honors an empty show: they could not satisfy the desires of his heart. Yet still he clung to them, like the rich young man that had kneeled at the feet of the Saviour, and asked for eternal life,—yet turned away rather than part with his possessions. Should he follow that young man's example, and endeavor to rest satisfied in his worldly riches? What would be his prospects when he received his summons to lay all these things down, leave them for ever, and give an account of the deeds done in the body? To what purpose had his wealth, time and talents been applied? Could the world give<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6179-00000080"/> strength or consolation at such an hour? He felt how worthless all these things would be to him, when about to enter eternity.</p>
               <p>Covering his face with his hands, he inwardly exclaimed, "I am the clay, be thou the potter; fashion me as thou wilt: I bow, Oh, Lord, in submission to thy righteous will."</p>
               <p>He felt, at that moment, that he had indeed obtained pardon. His iniquities, like leprous scales, fell from his soul,—while a delightful calm succeeded the fury of the tempest. He was now really a believer; a convert to the principles of Christ. He had received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and, like a little child, he was willing to sit at Jesus' feet, and learn of him to take up his cross and bear it patiently. He felt that the Lord had prepared a work for his hands: it was not revealed to him then; but he felt assured that it would be made plain to him when the time had arrived for the performance of it. He saw that God was in no-wise a respecter of persons; that he had been required to yield his all, even as his bondsman had been, and that Scipio had seen and felt the Lord's presence.</p>
               <p>He now realized true happiness; no anxious doubts or troublous forebodings as to the future disturbed the calm heaven of his soul. He earnestly prayed for strength to remain faithful to the end.</p>
               <p>It was in this peaceful state of mind that he made his appearance at the dinner-table. Emily observed his changed demeanor, and almost guessed the truth. His mother did also, and remarked to him that he did not look well, and advised him to go more into company than he had been doing of late. She was not aware how little sympathy he could now find among the votaries of fashion. His own home had more attraction for him than could be found elsewhere. His haughty mother was entirely unconscious of the love that filled the breast of her son for the fair and gentle Emily. As yet he had not<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6179-00000081"/> breathed it, even in the ears of his beloved. His deep respect for her high-toned principles and dignity of character, had made him feel that he was unworthy of one so pure of heart. But now, could he blessed with such a companion to walk by his side through life's journey, speaking words of comfort and encouragement, he felt that his cup would be filled to overflowing.</p>
               <p>After dinner, Aunt Rose, as she was removing the cloth, remarked to Emily, who was standing near a window opening on the lawn,—</p>
               <p>"Did yer notice de change in Massa De Lacy, Miss Emily?"</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, Aunt Rose?" said Emily, not wishing to give her any direct answer.</p>
               <p>"I mean," said Aunt Rose, "dat de Lord has convarted de soul ob Massa Vincent. He don't say nothin'; but I ken see it jest as clar as I see you thar, Miss Emily. Jest look out ob de winder at him playin' wid de chillen. His brow, dat was all knitted up like as if he was thinkin', is as open now and as clar as a child's; and de angry curl ob his lip is gone too. Thar is a smile thar as sweet and gentle as round de mouth ob little Miss Ella."</p>
               <p>Emily did look, and saw that calm brow and peaceful smile, which spoke so plainly of a heart at rest. Earnestly did she pray that he might ever hold with a firm grasp to the Rock of Ages; and when assailed by the storms and tempests of life, cling still closer to his refuge.</p>

               <p>IT was in the evening of the next day, that William came running into the parlor where Emily was sitting, reading. Taking her hand, he begged her to come out in the garden.</p>
               <p>"It is so lovely there!" said the child; "do come. The moon is shining brightly; see how beautiful it is!" continued he, as they descended the broad marble steps.</p>
               <p>"Oh! here is Ella and papa. I have been looking for you, Ellie," said her brother, going to her side. "Miss Mayland and I are going to walk in the garden; I want you to go with us."</p>
               <p>"Shall I make one of the company, Master William?" said his father, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes; do, papa," said both the children.</p>
               <p>"Do come; it would be so pleasant, if you would go, too."</p>
               <p>"Will my company be agreeable to you, Miss Mayland?" said Mr. De Lacy, speaking in a low tone, as he came to her side, and gracefully offered his arm, which was timidly accepted.</p>
               <p>When they arrived at the broad walk which divided the garden, William laughingly said, taking the hand of his sister,—</p>
               <p>"Here comes Neptune, Ellie; let us run a race with him, and see who will get to the pond, at the foot of the garden first."</p>
               <p>"Here, Nep!" cried the boy, as he and his sister ran swiftly down the walk. The dog started, pricked up his ears, and galloped off, barking loudly.</p>
               <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6179-00000083"/>
               <p>"Our company has deserted us, for the present," observed Mr. De Lacy, as he and Emily turned into another walk, which led in a different direction from that taken by the playful children. "I have much to thank you for, Miss Mayland," he continued, "in making my little ones what they are. I feel that it is owing to your example and patience, that they have, in a great measure, overcome many of their faults. I shall never cease to be grateful to you, for consenting to undertake the education of my motherless children. I did not then see, as I now do, the importance attached to the culture of a child's moral, as well as its intellectual nature."</p>
               <p>Did not Emily, at that moment, feel more than repaid for all the efforts she had put forth in their behalf? She saw that the good seed she had sown in their little breasts had taken root in another heart also, and had, through God's blessing, brought forth fruit abundantly. How did her heart swell with thankfulness to her heavenly Parent, as he frankly told her all his struggles and temptations, from the eventful morning, when, unknown to her, he had heard her read the account of the creation, down to his conflict of yesterday, and of his victory over self-love and pride, through God's Holy Spirit!</p>
               <p>Emily was deeply affected at the experience of the now humble Christian, and her tears fell freely. Mr. De Lacy tenderly took her hand in his, and declared his love.</p>
               <p>"May I not indulge a hope," he gently whispered, "that you are not indifferent to me?"</p>
               <p>Her hand was withdrawn from his clasp, but he felt the one that rested on his arm tremble.</p>
               <p>Before she could reply to his question, he said: "Dearest one, consent to be mine, and your happiness shall ever be my care. As far as in me lies, nothing shall be left undone to promote it. I shall, blest with such a<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6179-00000084"/> companion, press onward in the path of duty with renewed vigor. I feel that I am unworthy of the love of one so pure and good, yet may I not hope to gain that inestimable treasure?" he softly said, as he led the agitated girl to a seat.</p>
               <p>It was now that Emily, for the first time, realized how devotedly she loved Mr. De Lacy. She looked into her heart, and vainly endeavoured to fathom the deep fountain of her affection. She felt that their minds would blend and harmonize in perfect unity; and when her hand was again taken in his, it was not withdrawn.</p>
               <p>"Speak, dearest," he said, "tell me I am beloved, and make my happiness complete."</p>
               <p>"My own Emily," he said, tenderly, as an almost inaudible whisper reached his ear, and folding her in his arms, he pressed his lips to her forehead. For a moment her head rested upon his breast, and then she arose, just as the sound of merry voices was heard, coming toward them.</p>
               <p>The children were returning from their ramble, tired with their favourite sport of throwing sticks into the pond, for Neptune to swim after, and bring to land again.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy and Emily walked in the direction of the house, and were within a short distance of it, when they heard the voice of Aunt Rose, inquiring if any one knew whar Miss Emily had gone.</p>
               <p>"I've looked in her room, and de schoolroom, and in de library, and every what round de house."</p>
               <p>"Here I am, Aunt Rose," said Emily, coming in from the verandah, "what do you want with me?"</p>
               <p>"Why, here is a letter for you, Miss Emily; de postman brought it about half an hour ago, and I hab bin huntin' you eber since."</p>
               <p>Emily could not forbear smiling, as she took the letter: thanking Aunt Rose for the trouble she had been put to, she left the room, and sought her own apartment. She saw that the letter was mailed from Philadelphia<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6179-00000085"/> delphia, and the address on the envelope was written in a female hand.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps father is sick, and mother has written to inform me of it," thought Emily, as she hurriedly tore open the letter and read the contents. Her conjectures were correct. Mr. Mayland was lying dangerously ill, and requested his daughter to return immediately. "If there be not a change for the better," wrote his wife, "the doctor is of opinion that he cannot last many days."</p>
               <p>The young girl was shocked at this calamity; for she loved her father tenderly. After some time spent in thought, she became calmer, and went down stairs to communicate the sad intelligence to Mr. De Lacy.</p>
               <p>"There will be no opportunity of starting to-night, said he; "but there will be early in the morning. Compose yourself, dearest Emily. Your father may not be as ill as Mrs. Mayland thinks. Make all your preparations this evening. I will send Aunt Rose to assist you," he said as Emily left the room.</p>
               <p>It was late at night before all was finished, and she was at libery to seek repose. Vain was the effort; sleep and fled from her pillow, and left her a prey to forturing anxieties: perhaps she might never see her dear parent again, in this world. Her heart grew sick at the thought. How she longed to be on her journey! The rapid motion of the cars would be a relief; and there would be comfort in the thought that the distance between them was constantly lessening. It was distressing to lie there inactive, and count the slow-moving hours, as they were told by the deep-sounding voice of the old clock that stood in the hall. At length, to her great joy, she beheld the first faint streak of the coming day reddening the east. As soon as the welcome messenger appeared, she arose, and commenced dressing: her toilet was not yet completed, when Aunt Rose knocked at the door, and offered her assistance.</p>
               <p>"Dere be no time to spare, Massa De Lacy say, and de breakfast is all on de table."</p>
               <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6179-00000086"/>
               <p>In a short time Emily descended to the breakfast room, where she found the twins awaiting her.</p>
               <p>"What! up and dressed so early?" said she, trying to speak in a cheerful tone; but the thought of parting caused her voice to tremble, in spite of her efforts to the contrary. Her sorrow was infectious. Little Ella threw her arms around Emily's neck, and sobbed aloud.</p>
               <p>William had for some time entertained the idea that it was only little boys that cried, and as he was a big boy now, he must not give way to such weakness. But the sight of his sister's grief, and the thought of parting with his beloved governess quite overcame his fortitude, and the big tears followed each other in rapid succession down his rosy cheeks.</p>
               <p>"Miss Mayland will soon return to you, my dear children," said Mr. De Lacy, who had entered the room unobserved by the sorrowing group: "but it is quite time we had breakfasted," continued he, as he took his seat at the table.</p>
               <p>"Are you going to Philadelphia with Miss Mayland, papa?" said William, in a surprised voice, as he noticed that his father was dressed for travelling.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my son, I have business in that city. I had thought of writing to Mr. Ross," added he, addressing himself to Emily, "but have changed my mind, and prefer attending to it in person."</p>
               <p>The young girl looked her thanks, for she dreaded going alone; she was pretty well assured that his most important business was to accompany her home.</p>
               <p>The hasty meal was soon dispatched. She had bidden adieu to the weeping children, and pressed the hand of Aunt Rose, who sobbed out a 'dressing' on dear Miss Emily, and in a short time they were seated in the swiftly moving cars. For the first half hour of their journey, her companion remained quite silent: he rightly judged that any attempt<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6179-00000087"/> tempt at conversation would be painful to her in her present state of feeling; and Emily felt grateful to him for his delicate consideration. At length he made some remarks on the different objects they passed, until, insensibly to herself, Emily became interested. As they proceeded on their course, he gradually drew her into conversation. No effort on his part was spared to make the journey as agreeable as possible. Every attention was bestowed in so quiet and gentle a manner, that her excited spirits were soothed and comforted. She felt that he was one, to whose protecting love and care she could fearlessly trust her earthly happiness.</p>

               <p>THEY used all possible dispatch, only stopping for meals, until they arrived at their journey's end. When the carriage that conveyed them from the depot drew up at her father's door, Emily felt almost overcome with fatigue and anxiety. Mr. De Lacy tenderly assisted her out, and led her up the steps: still supporting her with his arm, he rang the bell. In a few moments the door was opened by a girl.</p>
               <p>"How is Mr. Mayland to-day?" asked Mr. De Lacy, for Emily could not; she dreaded, yet wished to hear the answer.</p>
               <p>"He is better, to-day, thank you, sir." Emily gave a long sigh of relief. "His fever left him last night," continued the girl.</p>
               <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6179-00000088"/>
               <p>"Oh, Emily! how could you have got here so soon?" said Mrs. Mayland, as she hastened forward. "I did not expect you to-day," and she embraced the young girl with more affection than she had ever before manifested. "Your father is better to-day, and longs to see you. He asked many times for you yesterday; but I am keeping you standing here in the sun,—do come in. You look pale and exhausted."</p>
               <p>At that moment Emily remembered she had not introduced Mr. De Lacy. Hastily apologizing for her forgetfulness, she made her mother acquainted with the name of her fellow-traveller. Mrs. Mayland greeted the gentleman with marked respect, and pressed him to walk into the house. He declined, giving, as an excuse, that he wished to see his friend without delay, and must return home as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>"I expect to start to-morrow afternoon," he said to Emily. "I will call to see you in the morning. Good bye for the present," and bowing to them, he walked away.</p>
               <p>As Emily entered the parlor, she was met by Eddie, who had grown to be quite a stout boy; he shyly received her kiss and embrace.</p>
               <p>"Don't Eddie remember sissy Emme?" said she, as that young gentleman sought out a place of refuge behind the door.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mayland had gone up stairs to acquaint her husband of the arrival of his daughter. She was fearful that if Emily entered the room without any previous intimation, it might excite the invalid, and cause a return of the fever.</p>
               <p>"Come, Emily," said Mrs. Mayland, from the landing; and the young girl ran up stairs to her father's room.</p>
               <p>It was with a powerful effort she restrained her feelings, as she bent over the wasted form of her parent, and tenderly kissed his parched lips. Mr. Mayland put his arm around the neck of his daughter, and pressed his lips again and again to her forehead.</p>
               <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6179-00000089"/>
               <p>"My child, my darling one!" he murmured, "thank Heaven, I am again permitted to behold you."</p>
               <p>Emily saw that he was much agitated, and endeavored to soothe his excited feelings. Before long, her efforts were successful, and at length, wearied with the exertion he had made, he fell asleep.</p>
               <p>"Now come with me," whispered Mrs. Mayland to Emily, "and I will show you your room. You had better lie down for awhile,—it will rest and refresh you after your long and tiresome journey."</p>
               <p>Now that the excitement was in a great measure over, she felt that Mrs. Mayland was right; that she did indeed stand in need of rest. Removing her travelling dress, the tired girl threw herself on the bed, and in a few minutes was sleeping soundly. She did not awake until she was aroused by the voice of Mrs. Mayland, calling her to tea. She arose, feeling much refreshed, and after a short time spent in dressing, she went to the door of her father's room. He was awake; Emily smiled, and telling him she would return presently, went down stairs to tea, where she found Mrs. Mayland at the table, with master Eddie in a high chair at her side.</p>
               <p>"You will excuse us for seating ourselves before you came down. Eddie was anxious to be put in his high chair, so that he might appear to full advantage, I suppose," said his mother, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Do you know that lady?" she continued, as Emily took her seat.</p>
               <p>"That's sissy Emme," answered Eddie, but "I don't know her:" and he looked down at his little plate, now and then raising his eyes to scan Emily's face, when he thought himself unobserved.</p>
               <p>"We shall be better acquainted before long," said his sister. "Do you like to hear stories, Eddie? I will tell you a pretty one, by and by, if you will come to me." Eddie's eyes brightened, and he was about getting<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6179-00000090"/> down from his chair to claim the fulfilment of the promise then.</p>
               <p>"Sissy Emme wants to take her tea first," said his mother, laying her hand on his arm, and gently detaining him.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sit still, Eddie; after supper we will go to papa's room," said Emily; and if you are very quiet, you shall sit on my lap, while I tell you the story. "I have some toys that I will give you to play with, if you do not make a noise with them.</p>
               <p>"I be very kiet," promised Eddie. "I'll not disturb papa. Come, Sissy Emme," said the little fellow, as she arose from the table; "Come to papa's room now;" and taking the hand of Emily, he led her up stairs.</p>
               <p>"Here's Sissy Emme, papa," said he, as he went to the side of the bed. "Did you know that her'd come?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my love," said Mr. Mayland, smiling, and drawing him close to his side. "Are you glad to see Emme?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am glad, answered Eddie; "her's going to tell me pretty stories, if I'm kiet, and give me some toys to play with. Will it disturb you, papa," asked Eddie, thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"No, my dear little son," said Mr. Mayland; "your sister is very kind: you must try and be a good boy, Eddie."</p>
               <p>"Me is a good boy, papa," said the child, confidently. "I was dood all tea time, wasn't me," said he, looking up in Emily's face.</p>
               <p>"Yes; you were a good boy, Eddie," answered she, smiling at the little upturned countenance; and stooping down she imprinted a kiss upon his rosy lips.</p>
               <p>Emily wished to sit up with her father that night. Mrs. Mayland urged upon her the necessity of rest; but finding that Emily was decided in her wish to remain; assuring her mother that she looked as though she required sleep more than she did at present. It did not need much persuasion on the part of Emily to induce the tired lady to seek repose. For many nights she had watched<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6179-00000091"/> beside the sufferer, her anxiety for him rendering her forgetful of herself; but now that he appeared better and Emily had arrived, whom she knew to be an excellent nurse, she was glad of an opportunity for a night's rest.</p>
               <p>"Don't think of sitting up in that dress, Emily, here is a loose one for you," said Mrs. Mayland, as she produced a dress from the wardrobe and hung it over the back of a chair, remarking that it would be more comfortable than the one she had on.</p>
               <p>Emily quietly stepped into another room, and donned the wrapper, in her heart thanking Mrs. Mayland for her kind consideration. Going back, she drew an easy chair to the bed-side of her father, and seated herself in it. He rested well all night, felt decidedly better the next morning, and when the doctor called, he pronounced him out of danger. Mrs. Mayland, too, looked much refreshed after her night's rest, and bustled about the house with almost her wonted energy.</p>

               <p>IT was about nine o'clock the same day that Eddie came into his father's room where Emily was sitting, and whispered in her ear that a strange gentleman was in the parlor who wished to go see her. Emily went down stairs, and found Mr. De Lacy awaiting her. He came forward as she entered the room, and affectionately taking her hand in his, led her to a seat, and inquired after her father.</p>
               <p>"He is much better to-day," replied Emily; "he slept well last night, and the physician has pronounced him convalescent,"</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy expressed his gratification at hearing that Mr. Mayland was considered out<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6179-00000092"/> of danger; "And may I not urge you to name an early day for our union, dearest Emily? My home will be empty without your loved presence, and my little ones will miss their gentle adviser."</p>
               <p>But Emily could not think of deciding upon any time until her father had been consulted on the subject; and so it was concluded, that Mr. De Lacy should write to Mr. Mayland, when that gentleman had recovered his health.</p>
               <p>Nothing of particular interest occurred at Emily's home for several weeks. Her father's health was now fully established; she had received a letter from Mr. De Lacy, giving an account of his safe arrival home, and of the health of the twins. They felt the absence of their friend and counsellor, and Ella, asked almost daily, when dear Miss Mayland would return. Mrs. De Lacy's health was quite failing; so much so that she did not leave her apartments.</p>
               <p>Early one morning about five or six weeks after this, Mr. Mayland and his daughter were sitting in the parlor, busily engaged in looking over and arranging sundry accounts that had accumulated during his illness, when they heard the door bell ring.</p>
               <p>"Who is that, I wonder, at this time in the morning," said Mr. Mayland, in a some what impatient tone of voice.</p>
               <p>Before Emily could reply, the street door opened, and the next moment the girl made her appearance with a letter in her hand, which she gave to Mr. Mayland and retired. Emily glanced at the directions, and her cheeks crimsoned; for she saw that it was in the well-known hand-writing of Mr. De Lacy.</p>
               <p>"Now who is there in Kentucky to write to me?" said Mr. Mayland, looking archly at the blushing girl; for, all unknown to her, he had penetrated her secret, or at least so much of it, that he believed his daughter was deeply interested in the graceful Kentuckian. The discovery was a painful one to Mr. Mayland. He was thankful that she was at<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6179-00000093"/> home; he would never consent to her return, and he trusted that time and absence would bring forgetfulness. He imagined that she did not understand the true state of her feeling; but as he looked at the post mark, and then at the heightened color of Emily, a sudden light illumined his understanding, and called forth the playful remark,—"There is a note for you, daughter," handing her one at the same time.</p>
               <p>He then leaned toward the window, and commenced reading. Forgetful of every thing else, Emily sat absorbed in watching her father's countenance. One moment there was a mixture of surprise and pleasure: his eyes lighted with a parent's love and pride; but the next instant a shade of mournful feelings took the place of the joyful expression. As she sat looking at her parent, Emily could interpret all those varied feelings.</p>
               <p>He was pleased at the prospect of seeing her happily settled, but sorrow took the place of joy, when he thought of being again separated rated from her, and giving her to the care of another. She had been so gentle and loving since her return home, and had devoted so much of her time to his comfort and entertainment,—how could he part with her? But he felt that her happiness depended on it. He would be selfish to wish it otherwise, He raised his eyes, and his glance rested on the fair face of his daughter. The expression was not to be mistaken: there was the light of love, reflected in the clear depths of her beautiful eye.</p>
               <p>"My Emily," said Mr. Mayland, softly; the young girl started, and rising from her seat, went to her father's side. He drew his arm around her, and said, in a low tone,</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy asks me to yield my treasure to his keeping; he says that my consent is all that is needed now to insure his happiness. What says my daughter? Speak freely your wishes on the subject: I would hear all."</p>
               <p>Emily murmured a reply to his questions.</p>
               <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6179-00000094"/>
               <p>"Then my consent shall be given," said Mr. Mayland, tenderly raising her head, and looking fondly into her tearful eyes, and whispering a parent's blessing on his dutiful child, added, "There, go to your room, my Emily." The street door again opened, and the voices of several persons were heard in the passage. "There are visitors coming in; you had better seek your room, and endeavor to compose yourself. In a short time you will feel more fitted to entertain company."</p>
               <p>Emily was glad to follow her father's advice, and entering her own apartment she closed the door, and commenced reading Mr. De Lacy's note: he again urged upon Emily, to consent to their marriage taking place at an early day.</p>
               <p>The thought of leaving her father was very painful to her; but now that he had given his consent, there appeared nothing in the way to prevent the consummation of the happy event speedily.</p>
               <p>"Let it take place this day six weeks, Emily," said Mr. Mayland, a few days after the receipt of Mr. De Lacy's letter, as they were seated at the dinner table, conversing on the all-absorbing topic.</p>
               <p>"I do wish you would have Mr. B—— to perform the ceremony, Emily," said Mrs. Mayland. "He is an Episcopal clergyman, and a favorite of mine."</p>
               <p>"Well, let it be as you wish," answered Emily, smiling. "I have no objection to having the service performed by him.</p>
               <p>That evening Emily wrote to her betrothed, and named the time before mentioned. After the letter was dispatched, and she had retired for the night, for a long time her thoughts were occupied with the future. When she should return to the home of Vincent De Lacy, as his bride, "how would she be received by his proud mother," whose cold indifference had so often chilled her heart, and involuntarily she shrank as her imagination pictured the disdainful glance with which Mrs. De Lacy would regard the almost<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6179-00000095"/> portionless bride of her wealthy son. And her mind turned to the twins, and now her heart was radiant with bright thoughts and happy images. Yes; she would be a mother to them, and she knew they would be loving and affectionate children to her. She longed for the time to come when she should again feel the soft clasp of Ella's little arms about her neck, and her warm kisses on her lips, or listen to and converse with her more mature-minded brother. She felt assured that the slaves would joyfully hail her as their mistress. She would have it in her power to comfort and instruct them in various ways. She suffered no compunctions of conscience at the idea of enlightening the intellects of the ignorant blacks, such as appears to affect the minds of the law-abiding citizens of the South. She had formed a noble plan, but that must be left for the future to unfold. And now before her rises the form of her betrothed; and she feels that he is one upon whose manly heart she can lean, and confide all her hopes and fears, her joys and sorrows, without fear of being misunderstood; and that he would ever be willing to share alike in both,—there was a happy feeling of security in the idea. These, and many other reflections passed rapidly through the mind of the young girl, mingled, with thoughts of leaving home; and even when sleep visited her, her mind was haunted with dreams;—sometimes pleasant, and again fraught with confused fears of approaching trouble.</p>
               <p>Thus the hours of darkness wore away, and when Emily awoke, the sun was peeping in between the curtains. From that time until the wedding-day, Mrs. Mayland was in a constant state of excitement; hurrying here and there in active preparation. In vain Emily offered her assistance. No! Mrs. Mayland would rather see to things herself.</p>
               <p>"Your time at home is short, Emily," she would say, and I want you to spend as much of it as possible with your father."</p>
               <p>"Do let me put up those curtains, at least,"<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6179-00000096"/> said Emily, one day, as she entered the dining-room and found Mrs. Mayland engaged in ironing.</p>
               <p>"No, no, Emily, they are for the front chamber windows; no one can arrange them as well as I; I know exactly where all the holes for the tacks are," said Mrs. Mayland, as she held the iron toward her face to ascertain the heat; "and, besides, the room is not ready yet: Jane must polish the windows, while I finish putting the carpet down. If you will be so kind as to keep Eddie out of my way, I shall feel greatly obliged. He's in all manner of mischief now that I have not time to attend to him." "What are you doing there?" she said, sharply, as she caught sight of that young gentleman about to immerse his hands in a pan of milk.</p>
               <p>"Me's making tustard for mamma," answered the child, looking into the pan.</p>
               <p>Emily could not refrain from laughing at the grave expression of his countenance.</p>
               <p>"Come, Eddie with me; I want you in the parlor," said his sister, gently drawing him from the table.</p>
               <p>The little fellow at once obeyed, and Emily believing that the true state of the case was, that Mrs. Mayland felt any one in the way that sought to help her, ceased making any further attempts, and spent quiet hours in conversation with her father, or busied herself in attending to her wardrobe, which did not take a very long time to complete. Her style of dressing was always neat and tasteful, and she carefully avoided all attempt at display. During those times, Eddie was her almost constant companion. She had a happy faculty of rendering herself agreeable to children, and contriving various amusements for their entertainment. If Eddie sought to touch any forbidden thing, her mild, "I would rather not," was instantly heeded. She endeavoured, by requesting little services of him, to make him feel that he was useful to her, while at the same time it kept his active spirit employed. Thus the time wore<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6179-00000097"/> away, until even Mrs. Mayland's hurrying and bustling came to an end, and she pronounced every thing finished to her satisfaction. It was late in the evening,—the last evening that she would spend at home for a long time,—the morrow would see her borne from her home a happy bride. Mr. De Lacy had arrived that afternoon, and had just taken his leave, with the intention of spending the night with Mr. Ross, who was invited to be present at the wedding.</p>
               <p>"He must act as my groomsman," laughingly said Mr. De Lacy, as he took his leave.</p>
               <p>The sun arose in a cloudless sky the following morning; the fresh breeze swayed the blossom-laden trees, and the voices of merry birds, from a neighbouring garden, rang out a merry chorus. In the parlor the clergyman, Mr. De Lacy, and Mr. Ross, were already assembled, awaiting the entrance of Mr. Mayland and the ladies. In a few minutes the door opened, and Mr. De Lacy arose, and received his bride from her father. They were followed by Mrs. Mayland and a young lady.</p>
               <p>Emily was attired in simple white; the only ornament was a wreath of orange-blossoms. A costly lace veil, the gift of Mr. Ross, fell in graceful folds around her, and quite enveloped her slight figure. Mr. De Lacy felt her hand tremble as he drew it through his arm; but, with that exception, she maintained a serene countenance and composed manner throughout the beautiful and impressive service used by the Episcopal Church. Proudly was the ring—emblem of unending affection—placed on the finger of his bride by the happy groom,—the solemn words were spoken, and Emily turned to receive her father's blessing and the congratulations of Mrs. Mayland and Lucy Grey, the young lady before spoken of. Mr. Ross claimed the privilege of kissing the young bride.</p>
               <p>"You are a fortunate man, De Lacy," he said, "in winning the love of my little favourite<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6179-00000098"/> vourite. You must bring her to see us every year; but here comes the carriage to convey you to the depot," he said, looking out of the window, as Emily entered the room dressed in a travelling costume.</p>
               <p>Tears fell fast as she bade adieu to her father and kissed Mrs. Mayland, feeling that there was a much better understanding existing now than when she left home before. Eddy was loath to part with his newly recovered sister, and eyed Mr. De Lacy in a way that betokened a very unbrotherly state of feeling. Lucy Grey promised to visit Kentucky, sometime, if Mr. Ross would accompany her. The old gentleman professed himself entirely at her disposal.</p>
               <p>"I will be your escort, Miss Grey," said he, jokingly, as he handed Emily into the carriage.</p>

               <p>THE journey back to Kentucky was a pleasant one; the weather was delightful, and Mr. De Lacy devoted to his lovely bride. It was at the close of a bright spring day when our travellers arrived at —— station, where they were to take leave of the cars. They found Scipio awaiting their appearance.</p>
               <p>"How are all at home?" was the first inquiry of the master.</p>
               <p>"Young miss and massa are well; but Missus De Lacy is very ill; she was taken bad day before yesterday; and Aunt Rose sent Sam for the doctor. He came and left some medicine for her to take; but she suffered so much last night, dat Aunt Rose thought de<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6179-00000099"/> powders wer'n't doin' no good; so, about eleven o'clock, her and Jenny got frightened and sent for him agin. She told me dis mornin' afore I started, dat de doctor said last night, if she didn't get easier soon, she couldn't stand it much longer.</p>
               <p>"Drive as fast as possible, Scipio," said Mr. De Lacy, hurriedly; and the man put the spirited horses to their speed, and in a short time they came to a halt at the steps of the verandah. They were met at the door by Aunt Rose, who had scarcely time to greet Emily as her mistress, before the twins came bounding across the hall, and were locked in their father's embrace.</p>
               <p>"Here is your mamma, my children," said he, as he drew them toward Emily, who had been standing unobserved by them.</p>
               <p>"Dear Miss Mayland," cried the twins, "you are our own mamma now; you will not leave us again, but will always stay here," said Ella, as she sprang into the extended tended arms of Emily. William took one of her hands in his, and said,—</p>
               <p>"Ellie and I have been very lonely without you. I am glad you are our mamma."</p>
               <p>"How is your mistress, by this time, Aunt Rose," said Mr. De Lacy.</p>
               <p>"I think, mars'r, dat she's jest gettin' weaker and weaker, she don't suffer much pain now; but I think dat her stay yer will be short."</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy silently took his young wife's hand in his, and led her to his mother's room. They found the sufferer lying quite still; her favourite slave woman Jenny was in attendance. They stood near the bed for several minutes before she opened her eyes. During that brief time, the mind of Emily was busy with many thoughts; all her fears and forebodings relative to the reception she expected to meet with from Mrs. De Lacy came fresh into her mind, and seemed at that moment to upbraid her. There was no glance of pride in those dark eyes now, over which the<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6179-00000100"/> film of death was gathering. The scornful expression of the mouth was gone, and in its place were white lips, slightly parted, and drawn tightly across her teeth, as if to repress any outward show of pain. Her whole countenance was indicative of the suffering she had endured before nature yielded to the power of the destroying angel. At length she appeared to notice them, and made an ineffectual effort to raise her head. Mr. De Lacy led Emily to his mother's side. She feebly clasped the hand of the young wife, and taking one of her son's, she pressed them in both of hers.</p>
               <p>"May Heaven bless you, my children," she whispered. Then, looking at Emily, she said: "Be a mother to my grand-children. You have endeavoured to do your duty heretofore, oh! still continue to love and care for them. I feel that I am going. Farewell, my Vincent. Where are the children?" she murmured faintly; and then suddenly arousing she looked around the room, as if in search of some one, and spoke aloud, "My slave, my Jenny, I would wish,"—but ere she had finished the sentence she was a corpse.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy gently laid his mother's head upon the pillow, closed her eyes, and quietly left the room.</p>
               <p>Emily remained for some time, wrapped in solemn meditation. At length the entrance of Aunt Rose disturbed the current of her thoughts, and she slowly left the room.</p>
               <p>"Where are the children, Jenny," she asked of the girl, as she met her on the stairs.</p>
               <p>"Down in de library, missus, with thar pa."</p>
               <p>Emily thought a moment, and then went down stairs and glided quietly into the room. She found her husband lying upon the sofa, and the twins standing near with faces expressive of sorrowful surprise. Mr. De Lacy's eyes were closed; a careless observer would have thought him asleep, but Emily knew<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6179-00000101"/> by the nervous movement about his eyes and mouth that he was endeavouring to keep back the swelling tide of his grief. She did not speak to him, but seated herself in the great arm chair; and taking Ella on her lap, drew William to her side. A long conversation ensued, for the most part carried on in a tone so low as to be quite inaudible to the mourner on the sofa. From that time until after the funeral of Mrs. De Lacy, there was an air of deep seriousness pervading the house. It was not that the slaves grieved for their mistress, who was oftentimes harsh, and always fretful and fault-finding, even when every effort was made by them to please and satisfy; but the emblems of mourning around them acted on their easily excited minds, and produced feelings of awe. The twins, two, were silent and grave; and were not seen, as usual, playing on the lawn, or chasing each other in merry glee on the verandah.</p>
               <p>"I declar' Miss Emily's de light and bressing ing ob de house," said Aunt Rose, one afternoon some weeks after the funeral, as she sat in the back porch with Mother Judy, who had come from the quarters to spend a quiet hour with her friend, glad to escape for a time from her noisy charges.</p>
               <p>"Yes," repeated Aunt Rose, emphatically, "she brought a bressing on dis yer house when she entered it. Look at de twins now; dey ain't like de same chillen. Miss Ella used to be allers pinin' and frettin,' and Mars'r William was so pash'nate dat nobody could please him; and now dere ain't sweeter or gentler chillen to be found any whar'. Dey used to be allers crossin' and disagreein' wid each other, and now, since Miss Emily's had de care ob dem, dere jest as lovin' as lambs. De're allers tryin' to save me trouble, de little dears! 'taint no trouble to wait on 'em now days. Yer should had seen 'em yesterday," continued Aunt Rose, smiling, with intense satisfaction, and smoothing out her ample check apron. "I was busy clarin' out<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6179-00000102"/> de dinin' room closet, when in comes Miss Ella and began to look 'round among things. She was wantin' me to get dis and de other for her, and she asked so coaxin'-like, dat I hadn't de heart to refuse. I was jest gwine to ask her to let me git done; for yer see I was in a hurry, when Mars'r William come to de door and sez, 'O Ellie,' says he, 'don't be troublin' Aunt Rose so. Come with me into the garden.' Now, who'd hev thought of a boy like him bein' so keerful of a body like me? But thar it is, yer see; dat's jest de way Miss Emily learns 'em to be good to eb'ry one, and den der's Mars'r De Lacy," and Aunt Rose moved her little old rocking-chair close to the old woman, and spoke in a low, confidential tone of voice;—"he used to be so proud-like, and didn't keer for his people, how they got along."</p>
               <p>"Yes," exclaimed Mother Judy, in a shrill voice, suddenly interrupting Aunt Rose in her narration, and causing her to move her chair a little further off; "I do 'member when he had dat thievin' overseer over us at de quarters; he'd like to have starved de whole lot of us, young 'uns and all; and mars'r neber hardly used to come to see how his people were sarved. De night he come wid de twins opened his eyes some. Polly was feared to say any thin'; but I jest spoke right out, and answered all mars'r's questions; and den in de mornin', when he most put an end to Scipio, jest finished him off with mars'r. Sam did tell me dat he was jest ready to drive off with some corn and meat when mars'r came up."</p>
               <p>"So he whar, de stealin' rascal!" indignantly said Aunt Rose, "I seed de wagon full ob bags, myself, and two ob mars'r's ho'ses geared in."</p>
               <p>"I wonder what went with him," said Mother Judy, musingly.</p>
               <p>"Well, I heard mars'r tellin' one day at de table dat he took hisself down South and got hired as overseer on a sugar plantation,<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6179-00000103"/> and not long after he was killed in a swamp by a slave belongin' to de place."</p>
               <p>"Sarved him right," said Mother Judy, decisively; "he'd bin abusin' dat ar slave, I'll warrant, or he wouldn't hab killed him."</p>
               <p>"Still, it was an orful thing, jest takin' his life at once, 'fore he'd time to 'fleet on his sins; but I reckon he'd been livin' till now, if he'd had time given him to think on all his wicked doin's," muttered Aunt Rose.</p>
               <p>"But we were talkin' 'bout mars'r; ain't dar a bressed change in him? he's so kind and 'siderate of all 'round him; he's a rale Christian now; one ken see it in all he says and does. It's all owin' to dear Miss Emily; she has de sweetest disposition dat I eber did see. Old missus used to be proud-like and high toward her sometimes; but Miss Emily was allers kind and gentle to her, and neber resented any thin', though I've seen her look sorrowful mor'n' once. Oh! yer should know her," said Aunt Rose, with a beaming face, for she dearly loved to talk about her young mistress.</p>
               <p>"Know her!" answered Mother Judy,—"I do know her; don't I know her to be one ob de kindest and best missus in de State? She's one ob Christ's deciples, one ob de meekest; for if she ain't a deciple, dere neber was one since de time ob de 'postles. She's down at de quarters, 'most ebery day, seein' to de chillen, or visitin' de sick. You should had seen her when Polly had de fever,—how she used to talk to her, and send her nice things to eat, and had one ob de wimen to stay all de time in de room, 'cause Polly was 'feared to stay alone. Sometimes mars'r come wid her, and den dey used to walk all 'round, and hab long talks, don't know what about; dey allers spoke low, as if dey didn't wan't others to hear. Scipio loves mars'r more den eber now. But it's time for me to be gwine back," she said, rising hastily, as the clock in the kitchen chimed five. "I declare how time flies! I never thought of its being so<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6179-00000104"/> late. De chillen will be cryin' and frettin' 'round me 'fore I shall have der supper ready for 'em."</p>
               <p>"Yer," said Aunt Rose, going to a dresser that stood in a corner of the kitchen, and taking out something wrapped in a towel. "Yer is a loaf of bread. Take it along; and thar's a pitcher of milk on dat ar table. Yer ken take dat, too;—'twill help out wid de young' un's suppers. Yer must come down and see me 'fore long, Aunt Rose," said the old woman, as she carefully stepped off the porch with both hands full.</p>
               <p>"Thank yer; I will some day," answered Aunt Rose; but in her mind she placed the time afar off; for Mother Judy's young 'uns (as she called them) were objects of particular annoyance to Aunt Rose, whenever she visited the old woman's cabin.</p>
               <p>From the foregoing conversation we may see the light in which Emily was regarded by the blacks, who, one and all, loved and respected her for her many virtues.</p>

               <p>THIS happy state of things continued without interruption for more than a year. If the slaves had longings for freedom,—as no doubt many of them had pictured the delights of having a home of their own, where they might gather their loved ones around them, without fear of having them snatched from their arms and driven they knew not whither,—outwardly all appeared contented on the plantation. One morning about this time, Emily, for the first since their marriage, observed a shade of anxiety resting on the countenance of her husband. Her first thought was that<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6179-00000105"/> he was indisposed, but upon inquiry she found that such was not the case.</p>
               <p>"No! my Emily, I am quite well," answered Mr. De Lacy, trying to appear cheerful; although it was quite plain to his wife that it was done with an effort. With the quick penetration natural to her, Emily at once perceived, that whatever was weighing upon her husband's mind, he did not then wish to make it known even to her;—so with true delicacy of feeling, she forbore to speak of, or appear to notice his abstracted manner. This state of things continued for several days. In vain the young wife sought by cheerful converse and affectionate caresses to remove the cloud from his brow. She was grieved to see her noble husband unhappy, without being able to share his trouble. She was sitting, one evening in the library'; the moonlight streamed in at the window, and stretched itself along the floor like a broad walk of molten silver; she was alone,—Mr. De Lacy had walked out after tea. The twins were playing on the lawn with their favourite Newfoundland, and the sound of their merry laughter, as it rang out on the evening air, spoke of happy hearts. As Emily sat musing on the last year's experience, her heart was lifted in thankfulness to God for strengthening and sustaining her in her various duties of wife, mother, and mistress, and permitting her so soon to see the beautiful effects of her obedience to duty. Her reflections were interrupted by the entrance of her husband. Emily saw at a glance that the cause of his disquietude had been removed; it needed no voice to assure her, as with eyes beaming with love and tenderness, she scanned his manly face. His brow was calm and unclouded as the moonlit heavens, that seemed to bend toward the earth as though they would gather the wearied ones in their embrace, and soothe their sorrows with gentle notes of celestial harmony.</p>
               <p>"My Emily," said Mr. De Lacy, as he took<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6179-00000106"/> a seat beside her, "there has been a subject pressing on my mind for several weeks past, and this evening it has clearly appeared to me the course I ought to pursue. It has cost a severe struggle to yield my own will in the case. I once thought that I had given all up; but I find the longer I live, that nature oftentimes shrinks from the cross, and would plead to have it removed. Ever since that memorable day, when I resolved to serve Christ only, I have felt that there is a work in store for me. I now see that it is inconsistent for a Christian to hold his fellow-creatures in bondage. I feel that I must yield to the requirements of duty, or suffer a wreck of my soul's peace. It will be a great loss in a pecuniary view."</p>
               <p>"But an everlasting gain," solemnly said his wife, as she leaned her head upon his shoulder. "Do not hesitate one moment, dearest Vincent, in the performance of this act of justice. You do not know how ardently I have longed to see this hour, and how fervently I have prayed to hear those words from your lips. There are many things connected with slavery that are shocking to my mind. There is Scipio, for instance; he certainly is an humble follower of Christ; and how can one Christian hold another in so cruel a bondage? Oh! my dear husband,—this is indeed the happiest moment of my life!"</p>
               <p>"I feel, Emily, that, under God, it is all owing to you," said Mr. De Lacy, tenderly kissing his devoted wife. "If Heaven had not guided your footsteps hither, and made you an instrument in my conversion, I should not have seen, as I now do, the sinfulness of my ways: I should, no doubt, have continued trafficking in human flesh, and, as far as lay in my power, shutting out their souls from the light of Heaven, regardless of the impending wrath of divine justice, until the strike descended, and the fearful words,—"Depart ye," sounded through my condemned soul; but, thank God, I can look forward to<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6179-00000107"/> better things now. But I wished to have some conversation with you, my love, relative to the emancipation of our people. If I mistake not, your mind has often dwelt upon the subject, and no doubt you have formed plans for liberating and assisting them until they could provide for themselves. If such has been the case, pray let me have the benefit of your thoughts. I feel that I am prepared to give the blacks their freedom, but how it is to be accomplished is an undecided point."</p>
               <p>"I would suggest," said Emily, after a pause of several minutes, "since you desire my opinion, that you offer all their freedom, and then propose sending all those who are willing to go, to the Colony of Liberia. You know that you can have the assistance of the Colonization Society. If I judge rightly, the majority would like to go: if there are some unwilling to leave us, we could find employment for such; indeed we shall need their aid."</p>
               <p>"I have been thinking," said her husband, "while you have been unfolding your plan of emancipation,—which I consider entirely feasible, and thank you for it,—that the twins' birth-day is in about three months: suppose we decide upon that time as the great day of emancipation. What do you think will be the opinion of the children upon the subject?"</p>
               <p>"We can soon ascertain, for here they come," said Emily, smiling, as their merry faces peered in at the door.</p>
               <p>"Come here, darlings," said their father; "I have a question for you." The twins bounded to his side, and stood still with expectant faces.</p>
               <p>"Now listen to me," said Mr. De Lacy. "Your mamma and I feel it to be wrong to hold our people longer in slavery, and intend to liberate them. Now tell us what you think of it. Do you like the idea, my little lady?" said her father, as he lifted his daughter on his knee, and pushed back her dishevelled<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6179-00000108"/> hevelled ringlets. She looked quite serious a moment, and then said,—</p>
               <p>"No, papa; I don't want Aunt Rose to leave us, nor Scipio. No, I don't want any of them to leave," continued she, shaking her head, decisively.</p>
               <p>"But suppose, my dear," said Emily, "that they desire their freedom, and while they remain slaves they are liable to be separated from each other, never to meet again in this world. Don't you remember telling me how badly poor Scipio felt when he was taken from his home and sold among strangers? Then consider the sufferings that his father underwent when he was taken prisoner by another tribe, which, no doubt, had been instigated to make war by cruel, avaricious men, who wished to obtain slaves; for it is a well known fact, that people who would otherwise have lived peaceably near one another are set at enmity for this very purpose. How must the chieftain's soul have swelled with indignation at his cruel wrongs while being borne from his native country, and at last compelled to labor under the eye of an unfeeling task-master! Think of all this, Ella, and then let us hear your opinion."</p>
               <p>"I would rather the people were free, papa," softly said the child, as her beautiful eyes swam in tears. "I wonder if Scipio will go back to his home in Cuba," continued she, looking into her father's face, inquiringly.</p>
               <p>"I think not," Ellie," said Mr. De Lacy, smiling at the innocent questioner. He was brought from there many years ago, and most likely his parents are not living now, and his brothers and his sisters all scattered. But what says my son? Does he wish the people free?" said Mr. De Lacy.</p>
               <p>"Yes, papa; I was very glad when I heard you say so. I would like to be present when you give them their liberty, if you are willing. You always thought slavery wrong, mamma, didn't you?"</p>
               <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6179-00000109"/>
               <p>"Yes, my son; I have, ever since I attained to years of maturity, felt confident that holding our fellow creatures in bondage is a grievous sin," answered Mrs. De Lacy.</p>
               <p>"But it is time you were in bed, my dears. Ella is almost asleep now," said she, rising and pulling the bell cord.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes Aunt Rose entered, and the children, kissing their parents, left the room with their kind-hearted nurse. For some time after the twins were gone, Mr. De Lacy sat near the window buried in thought. At length he said,—</p>
               <p>"I don't think, my love, that I shall remain here after the emancipation of our slaves. There is always a great amount of prejudice against a person even suspected of entertaining liberal views in regard to blacks. How great then would be the dislike to one who held slaves himself, and was the son of a slaveholder, yet voluntarily liberated them.</p>

               <p>"I HAVE resolved upon selling my estate here," continued Mr. De Lacy," and purchasing a home elsewhere. What say you to our removing to the thriving State of Michigan? In some parts of it there is excellent society to be found,—emigrants from New England, well educated and intelligent."</p>
               <p>"You speak my mind, dear Vincent," answered his wife. "I do wish to leave here and find a home in another State, where slavery does not exist. If you have a choice in removing to Michigan, I feel perfectly willing to go wherever you may decide, as the place of our future residence."</p>
               <p>"I have, I think, a favourable opportunity<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6179-00000110"/> of selling my estate to Dr. Jones, of M——. He made me an offer some time ago. I then told him I did not wish to sell. I heard, this morning, that he was not yet suited. I will ride there to-morrow and see him. He was anxious to buy of me. He intends with-drawing from the practice of medicine, and carrying on farming extensively."</p>
               <p>Accordingly, on the morrow, Scipio drove his master to M——. Mr. De Lacy found that the information relating to the Dr's. not being suited elsewhere was correct. That gentleman appeared pleased when he heard that Mr. De Lacy had been considering his proposal, and had resolved upon selling; for, in truth, the doctor had long coveted the ownership of the broad acres and stately mansion of the De Lacy estate. As both gentlemen were of generous dispositions', they did not long consider about minor things. The price was named and accepted by the doctor, after spending a few minutes in gazing out of the office window, and making a rapid mental calculation of his resources.</p>
               <p>"I will see you again in a few days, Mr. De Lacy," said Dr. Jones, bowing and smiling very affably, as his visitor rose to leave. "I will bring my lawyer with me, and have the business finished at once," he added.</p>
               <p>"He don't intend giving me time to change my mind, I see," thought Mr. De Lacy, as he walked away.</p>
               <p>In a short time titles were examined, and the necessary papers prepared by Dr. Jones' lawyer. Mr. De Lacy reserved the right of possession for one year.</p>
               <p>All this had transpired without the knowledge of the blacks;—even Scipio was entirely ignorant of it, and also of his master's noble intention of liberating them. How would his heart have throbbed in joyful hope as he looked forward to the realization of one idea, that for years had been present with him; but let us not anticipate. Mr. De Lacy had mentioned it as his particular<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6179-00000111"/> desire that it should be kept a profound secret by his wife and children.</p>
               <p>The three months had almost expired; all the business relative to sending such of the slaves as wished it to Liberia, was completed. As to those who preferred remaining, he would have to provide for them as best he could.</p>
               <p>The twins counted the days, and held long consultations, with their heads close together. What their conversations were, no one knew, as they admitted no third person into their confidence. At length the long expected day dawned, fair and bright. The children were up, and had induced Aunt Rose to rise two hours before her usual time and dress them.</p>
               <p>"Why, what's de matter wid de chillen, I wonder?" said she to herself, as the twins, hand in hand, danced out of the room. I thought dey'd be disappointed like, as thar not to hev a party dis year; but dey jest seem to be wild wid joy. It's 'cause dere 'spectin' some pleasure, I reckon."</p>
               <p>While Aunt Rose was thus speculating, the children, fresh and rosy from their morning bath, proceeded to the door of their parents' room. Ella's little hand was raised to knock, when William gently held it back.</p>
               <p>"We are so early, Ellie, perhaps we may disturb mamma and papa," said the thoughtful child.</p>
               <p>They were about to go quietly away, when the door opened, and the smiling face of Emily appeared.</p>
               <p>"What! up so early, my darlings?" A happy birth-day!" said she, fondly embracing them, and drawing them into the room.</p>
               <p>"Ah, here are my little ones!" said Mr. De Lacy, tenderly kissing his children. "The expected event of the day has, I see, driven sleep from your eyes at an earlier dawn than usual. Your mamma and I have decided to make it known to the people immediately after breakfast. I will have them to assemble on the lawn."</p>
               <p>"Oh, papa! I'm glad now that you are going<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6179-00000112"/> ing to free them," said Ella: "but I hope Aunt Rose won't leave us, though," she added, seriously.</p>
               <p>"I think, my dear, that in all probability she will incline to take advantage of your papa's offer," said Emily. "You must not look grieved," continued Mrs. De Lacy, as she observed the visible lengthening of the little girl's face. "Your good nurse, most likely, will prefer a home of her own, where she can have her two girls with her."</p>
               <p>"There is the breakfast bell, papa!" said William, with a brightening countenance. "Do let us go down." "Are you ready, mamma?" said Ella, taking Emily's hand, and leading the way to the door.</p>
               <p>"Is Scipio in the kitchen, Jenny? If he is, tell him I wish him to come here," said Mr. De Lacy to a girl, as he entered the breakfast room, leading William by the hand.</p>
               <p>"I think he is, Mars'r," answered the girl, as she placed some hot cakes on the table; and giving her master a quick, furtive glance, she left the apartment.</p>
               <p>"Whar's Scipio, Sam?" said she, as she entered the kitchen, and looking around, failed to discover the object of her search.</p>
               <p>"He's out at de barn, seein' to de carriage ho'ses I'spects," answered Sam.</p>
               <p>"You go out dar and tell him dat mars'r wants him to go to de breakfast room."</p>
               <p>"Hi!" said the black, rolling up the whites of his eyes, "Dat's queer now: wonder what mars'r wants with Scipio. Hope nothin's gone wrong on de place. Dis yer chile don't want to see another overseer on de farm," said Sam, apprehensively: for be it known, since the departure of Mr. Jenks, Scipio had been intrusted with the management of the farm land, and the care of the field hands, and truly the slaves had cause to rejoice at the exchange of overseers. Their once miserable quarters were now well cleaned, and thoroughly repaired, while their scanty allowance was increased<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6179-00000113"/> creased to a plentiful supply of good whole-some food."</p>
               <p>"Don't know what mars'r wants with him," said the girl; "jest yer go and tell him, will yer?"</p>
               <p>In a few minutes Scipio appeared at the door of the breakfast room.</p>
               <p>"I wish," said Mr. De Lacy, gravely, "you to collect all the people on the lawn, in front of the verandah, in half an hour from this. You will attend to it at once. I wish to speak to them."</p>
               <p>"Yes, mars'r; they shall all be thar directly," answered Scipio, in a respectful voice, his countenance exhibiting such evident signs of astonishment, that it was with difficulty Emily could prevent the twins from giving way to their merriment, or repress a smile herself.</p>

               <p>IN less than the appointed time Scipio had the slaves all collected in front of the house, where they remained standing with wondering countenances, occasionally talking to each other in low tones. They had not waited many minutes before Mr. De Lacy made his appearance, accompanied by his wife and children. He stated to them, in simple language, suited to their understanding, his objections to holding them longer in bondage, and concluded his remarks by offering them their freedom. For a brief<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6179-00000114"/> space, there was perfect silence, and then arose such a shout, as only hearts long bowed in servitude, and suddenly set free, could utter. Again and again that wild, glad cry of freedom rang out, loud and clear upon the morning air, mingled with blessings uttered by pious lips, upon their generous-hearted master. The twins were much excited, and joined in the shout of Liberty.</p>
               <p>"It is the people's birth-day, mamma," said Ella, joyfully; "the birth-day of their freedom." But Emily was unable to reply; she was leaning on the arm of Mr. De Lacy; her slight figure trembling with emotion. She felt that she had been instrumental in bringing about the present happy scene. Her noble husband stood calm and composed, waiting for quietness to be restored, before he again commenced speaking. On a sign given by Scipio, all stood mute. His master then stated, that all who wished to go to Africa should be sent there, and provided for, until they were enabled to provide for themselves.</p>
               <p>"You will there," said he, "be on an equality, and no one will be considered above another, except as their superior talents or perseverance may give some an ascendency over others."</p>
               <p>The majority of the number immediately declared their willingness to go. Scipio had not yet spoken. He stood leaning, with folded arms, against a tree that grew near the verandah. His sable brow bore the impress of profound thought, and at times the expression of his countenance was almost majestic. As Mr. De Lacy turned toward him, he was struck with the look of lofty meditation upon the features of the newly liberated slave.</p>
               <p>"Well, Scipio," said his master, as he stretched out his hand toward him, "What do you intend doing with yourself?" Mr. De Lacy tried to speak in his usual tone; but his voice trembled, and the gathering moisture in his eyes told how difficult it was for him to part with one who had carefully<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6179-00000115"/> attended to his wants when he was a child, and had been so faithful to his interests since he had arrived at man's estate. Do you think of going to Liberia?" continued Mr. De Lacy, after a moment's pause.</p>
               <p>"Yes, mars'r," observed Scipio, calmly; "I want to go to Africa, but not to stay at Liberia."</p>
               <p>"Why, where do you wish to go?" said Mr. De Lacy, in a tone of surprise.</p>
               <p>The black man started from his easy position against the tree, and advanced a step or two toward the verandah.</p>
               <p>"My father," said he, while his broad breast heaved with contending emotions, "was a prince in his native country; it chanced that while hunting on a mountain he was surprised and taken prisoner by another tribe, who were at war with his people. His enemies, regardless of his high rank, sold him to the captain of a slave vessel, who brought him to Cuba, and doomed him to a life of bondage. I am his first-born, and often at night, when seated on the floor of our cabin at his feet, have I listened to his tale of sorrow. He used to dwell on the beauty of the village belonging to his tribe, until I seemed to see the very place itself. The lofty mountains, covered with tall trees, that almost surrounded the spot, and the green valley that lay at their feet, dotted over with the plantain-covered huts of his people. I would go there and speak into their ears the glad tidings of the gospel, and endeavor to teach them some of the arts of civilized life."</p>
               <p>"This thought has been with me for a long time, mars'r,—when I awoke in de mornen',—when I was at work in de fields, and in de still night, it was ever present with me; always sayin' 'De time will come, Scipio, when you will be sent as a messenger of peace to your father's tribe.' I feel dat de time has now come, and de Lord has prepared a way for me."</p>
               <p>"But how will you find your father's people<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6179-00000116"/> ple in that distant land," said Mr. De Lacy, with much emotion.</p>
               <p>"De same Lord dat sends me will guide me to de right spot, mars'r," said Scipio,—his countenance glowing with the light of faith,—"and then I remember my father's descriptions;—never, never, will they pass from my mind."</p>
               <p>As Scipio ceased speaking, the shrill voice of Mother Judy was heard:—</p>
               <p>"Yes; I've made up my mind, and am determined to go."</p>
               <p>"But you'll never live to get to Liberia, Mother Judy," said the milder voice of Polly, who was evidently endeavouring to dissuade the old negress from attempting the voyage.</p>
               <p>"Listen to me, chile," said Mother Judy, stretching out her trembling hand, and pointing at Polly with her long bony finger:—I've heard my old grandmother tell 'bout Africa;—'twas her native country. She was stolen from thar' when she was a young critter; not much mor'n a chile;—but she could tell about de tall palms that grew thar; and the beautifulest flowers, and de best tasted yams in de world; and den de most lovely birds, and great butterflies dat looked jest like leaves of gold floatin' in de breeze. I've longed agin and agin to see dem. Yes, Polly, I'm detarmined to go; and I'se faith to believe dat de good Lord will carry Old Judy safe over de great waters, and let her be safe landed in Africa."</p>
               <p>"So, then, you intend leaving us," said Emily, who had advanced quite near, while Mother Judy was speaking, unseen by the old woman.</p>
               <p>"Yes, missus, I'm sorry to leave you, and de twins, and Mars'r De Lacy; but I would rather go."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Emily, feeling somewhat amused at Mother Judy's energetic manner; "I hope you will have a pleasant voyage to Africa, and a comfortable home when you get there. "I must," said she, smiling, "put you under the care of Polly. You helped to<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6179-00000117"/> nurse her when she was sick with the fever, and no doubt she will now be willing to do all for your comfort that she can."</p>
               <p>"Polly good-naturedly promised to care for the old woman, both during the passage and after their arrival at Liberia. "But I think she had better stay with you;" she could not forbear adding; as her young mistress turned away, and walked to where her husband was standing, talking to Nero and another stalwart black.</p>
               <p>"No, mars'r," said Nero; "I'se not gwine to leave yer. My old woman don't want to, either. She says she'll neber get another missus like she's got now; nor Peter here don't want a better home dan he has with yer. You'll be wantin' hands on de place yer gwine to, and Peter and I and our families will be needed to help along wid de work."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Mr. De Lacy, "if you want to go with me, I dare say I can find plenty for you to do."</p>
               <p>"Thank yer, mars'r," said both of the men, evidently pleased.</p>
               <p>Just then little Ella timidly touched her father's arm; and as he leaned his head toward her, she softly whispered,—</p>
               <p>"Ask Aunt Rose if she intends going to Liberia, papa."</p>
               <p>"What do you think about going to Africa, Aunt Rose?" said Mr. De Lacy.</p>
               <p>"I'm not gwine, mars'r," she answered, decisively. "I'm afeard to go on de water; and den I b'lieve dat it's a wild savage sort ob a place, not fit for a Christian body to live in. No! I'se made up my mind whar I'se gwine to go and take my gals."</p>
               <p>"And where is that?" said Emily.</p>
               <p>"Why, missus, I'se gwine to Philadelpher;—dat's de berry place I want to get to. Dar's plenty ob Quakers dere, I've hearn say, and dey allers are good to color'd folks. I ken get a little home dar, and put Sally and Nelly out to sarvice, and take in fine washin' and ironin' myself. We'd get along nicely I know. I could lay by part of our 'arnin's<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6179-00000118"/> eb'ry week. I'se jest sure we could live rale happy thar."</p>
               <p>"Well, I will send you and the girls to Philadelphia," said Mr. De Lacy. I expect Mr. Ross here, shortly. He will, I have no doubt, take charge of you to the city, and help you to find a house to live in; and perhaps interest himself in getting places of employment for the girls. I know he is acquainted with several wealthy quaker gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Aunt Rose appeared highly gratified with this intelligence, and heartily thanked mars'r for his kindness. The twins looked much disappointed, when they heard the decision of their kind nurse, but were reconciled to her leaving, when Emily whispered that she might partly take her place in future. They kissed her fondly, while Ella declared that she had the best mamma in the whole world. But let us take leave of the De Lacy family for a time, and turn our attention to the wanderers, who have embarked to seek their fortunes in a distant land.</p>

               <p>THEY have had a prosperous voyage, and are now within a short distance of their journey's end. It is early morning, the tips of the foam-clad waves sparkle and flash with the first beams of the rising sun. The vessel is evidently nearing land, and ther captain is waiting to hear the man on the look-out announce the welcome tidings. Scipio is standing upon the deck. His firm bearing and calm expression bespeak a strength of purpose not easily overcome by difficulties. Like the great Apostle, he is sent to preach salvation to the heathen, and sound the gospel trumpet among a people who know not God. He goes strong in the<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6179-00000119"/> faith that he who sends him is able to save to the uttermost, and will strengthen him for the work he has been selected to perform. Mother Judy, too, is upon deck. Her wasted form and sunken eyes tell a tale of suffering. She has been ill nearly all the voyage. She is supported in the arms of Polly, who, true to her promise, has faithfully discharged the duties of nurse to the ailing old woman. They have carried her upon deck to catch the first sight of the anxiously expected land. She is straining her sight across the restless waters, as though she would pierce the blue veil that bounds her vision, and see the sand-strewed coast beyond. But hark! what sound is that, which like an electrical shock, causes all hands to start to their feet, and strain their eyes in one direction. It is the cry of land from the look-out. The captain takes his glass for the purpose of scanning the distant shore. It is, as yet, quite invisible to the naked eye; but ere long the patient watchers are rewarded by the sight of a low ridge of sand, stretching far as the eye can reach, entirely destitute of vegetation. As the vessel rapidly nears the coast, mountains covered with timber become visible. At this welcome sight, a loud hurrah arose from the crowded deck. Old Mother Judy started to her feet with unwonted strength, and stretching her skinny arms towards the land,—as though she would hasten the ship still faster on her course,—exclaimed, triumphantly,—</p>
               <p>"Dar now, de mars'r has permitted his ole sarvent to see the land ob her forfadders. I had faith when I started on dis yer voyage dat I should set my foot on de soil ob Africa, and,"—but before she could finish the sentence, a deadly sickness came over her, and she sank, fainting, into the arms of Polly,—who, with the assistance of another woman carried her below, where she remained until the vessel came to anchor and the passengers were sent ashore. Mother Judy was borne in the stalwart arms of Scipio, who carried<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6179-00000120"/> the old woman as carefully as though she was an infant to the temporary home that had been provided for them, until they had received their portion of land, and been enabled to erect dwellings.</p>
               <p>Mother Judy continued very ill for several days, and it was more than a week after their landing, when, one morning, at her request, Scipio carried her out and seated her on a mat that Polly had placed at the foot of a stately palm. For a long time she remained silent, with her head leaning against the trunk, that arose from the earth like a column, while its leafy crown swayed and rustled in the fresh breeze. Thus she sat, feasting her eyes on the varied beauties of the scene.</p>
               <p>"Polly," she said at length,—and her voice, unlike the shrill tones in which she usually spoke, was feeble and tremulous,—"I feel, my chile, dat I have not much longer to live; de hour-glass hab been shaken and shaken until de last grains of sand are most run out. I feel willin' to go, now dat de Lord hab let me see the desire ob my heart. I've been brought safely 'cross de great waters, and I'm not afeard to launch my boat in de waves ob Jorden, wid de Lord for de pilot. I hab faith to believe dat he will steer straight to de harbor, and land my soul right at de gates ob glory. I thought 'twas great to get off de ship, and go ashore here when I was sick and sufferin'. Then, what will it be jest to step out ob my frail boat, and land right on de bright shore ob Canaan, where I shall neber more feel pain or weakness to all eternity. Oh! it's a glorious thought, chillen. But I want to tell yer somethin' while I hev de strength left:—when I'm gone I wan't yer to bury me here, jest at de side ob de tree, and plant some flowers on my grave. I want de butterflies to hover round, and de little birds to sing above me, and de sunshine to rest upon de spot: will yer mind?" said the old woman, faintly looking at Polly.</p>
               <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6179-00000121"/>
               <p>Polly solemnly promised, in a voice choked with sobs, to perform the last wish of the dying woman.</p>
               <p>"Will yer be so kind as to carry me in again, whispered she to Scipio.</p>
               <p>Scipio gently took her in his arms and carried her into the house. He was in the act of placing her on the bed, when her frame was, for a moment, slightly convulsed, and when he laid her down, Mother Judy's spirit had landed, as we trust, on Canaan's happy shore, and entered those gates that ever stand open to the redeemed of the Lord. Her last request was faithfully attended to by Polly and Scipio. They buried her in the spot she had selected, and planted some of those gorgeous flowers which are to be found in that sunny land. As though in obedience to her wish, a bright-wing warbler, poured forth rich strains of music from his leafy bower above the grave of Mother Judy, while the last rays of the setting sun slanted across the spot, and shed a radiance on the newly raised mound.</p>

               <p>SCIPIO left the colony shorthly after Mother Judy's death. He accompanied by a stout negro, who claimed to be one of the tribe from which Scipio's father had been stolen; the man said he remembered his father's having often told him of the sudden disappearance of their chief, and of the mourning that ensued when they found that he did not return.</p>
               <p>"My father said," continued the negro, "that he was well beloved by his people."When he found that Scipio was the son of the absent prince, he treated him with great deference and respect, and volunteered to guide him to his father's tribe.</p>
               <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6179-00000122"/>
               <p>When Scipio declared his intention of remaining among them, his joy knew no bounds: he danced and capered, showing all manner of extravagant gestures. Scipio regarded the savage with looks of wonder and pity. He sought all the information he could from his active guide, (who spoke the English language tolerably well,) respecting the people among whom he expected to live in the future. Thus, he travelled on, day after day, sometimes exposed to the burning rays of a tropical sun, while passing over plains destitute of shade, or climbing some rugged steep covered with great trees, which were most of them unknown to him; but not so to his dusky companion. who claimed their giant trunks friends, and pointed out their various uses to the wondering Scipio; who lifted his heart in gratitude to God for his goodness, in that he provides for his children every where, even spreading a table in the trackless wilderness for their  use. But now his guide plunges down the steep ridge and makes his way through vines and tangled underbrush into a narrow gorge between the hills, where the sound of a cataract was heard. Scipio followed as best he could. At one time he felt his feet slipping, and before he could endeavour to save himself, the loose earth and stones gave way, and he was precipitated several feet below, and caught by the thorny leaves of a giant cactus, which for a moment detained him in its embrace, and then its branches giving way, he was again sent on his headlong course, until he was effectually stopped by a vine, that stretched like some enormous reptile across his way. For a few minutes he clung to this support, almost breathless; his clothes torn, and his person scratched and bleeding. In his fall he had struck his head and severely bruised it. But the sound of the waterfall, like the voice of a siren, bade him not linger there. Its brawling murmurs were as delightful strains of music in his ears. He had suffered severely from thirst that day; not a<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6179-00000123"/> drop of water could be obtained upon the mountain. His lips were parched and feverish; while his usually elastic step was now feeble and uncertain. Quitting his hold on the vine, he again plunged downward, and the next moment he came crashing through a mass of vegetation, and stood beside his guide at the foot of the falls. He hastily satisfied his thirst, and throwing aside his clothing, he plunged into the refreshing water, to the evident dismay and terror of his companion, who had a strong antipathy to venturing his person in the uncertain element. Nor could all the persuasions of Scipio, who had come to land and was resuming his garments, prevail on the negro to try a bath. With a faithless countenance he shook his head, exclaiming, "No'ee, no'ee; bad, very bad."</p>
               <p>After resting for some time beside the gurgling waters, they arose and continued their toilsome journey toward the interior of the continent.</p>
               <p>At length, after a weary march of many days' duration, they arrived at the foot of a long mountain ridge, which the guide assured Scipio was the chain of hills that enclosed the valley where dwelt the people of his father's tribe. What nameless emotions filled the breast of the chieftain's son, as he sat in their temporary encampment that night beside his guide, who had lain himself on the ground, and was sleeping soundly. Not the slightest noise disturbed the deep silence of nature; even the leaves gave no rustling sound in the still atmosphere. The full moon shed down her mild lustre undimmed by even a passing cloud. Scipio felt the calm of the peaceful hour suited to meditation. Sleep was not for him then, but earnest prayer and heartfelt thanksgiving. The desire of his heart was about to be consumted. In a few hours his eyes would behold the people among whom he was to labor. How fervent was his zeal, how strong his faith that the power which had shielded<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6179-00000124"/> him from danger, and guided his steps safely hither, would enable him to instruct the simple inhabitants in the truths of Christianity, prevailing upon them to cast aside their idols and turn from natural darkness to spiritual light! He hoped to impart to them some of the arts of civilization, and teach them how to cultivate the earth, and draw their nourishment from her generous heart. If the soil of their valley were equal in fertility to many of those they had traversed, the husbandman's labor would be light and the yield bountiful,—well repaying him for his care. All this, by patient perseverance he hoped to effect, and he longed for the time to arrive when the wilderness should blossom as the rose, and the spear and shield be cast aside for the plough and pruning-hook.</p>
               <p>Then he looked forward to the long years of toil and privation that must ensue, before he could hope to see, even in part, the fulfilment of his desires.</p>
               <p>He saw the vast amount of ignorance and superstition that would have to be met and overcome, before they could appreciate the blessed influence of his glorious mission, yet he did not give way to despair, but hopefully looked forward to the future—when bowed with age, and ready to depart, he could behold a scene of peace and plenty, and hear the grateful songs of a people redeemed from barbarism. To the eyes of the world his mission would appear a lowly thing; but to Christian minds it was a glorious privilege, that of being an instrument in the hands of Almighty power, of turning a people from heathenism to the light of Christianity.</p>
               <p>But what causes Scipio to start from his reverie, and assume a listening attitude? He glanced rapidly around. The first faint streaks of daylight gently part the gray curtains of the east, and timidly peep forth; yet it is too dark to admit of seeing any thing with distinctness. In vain his searching eyes endeavor to pierce the surrounding darkness<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6179-00000125"/> of the vast forest. The huge trees stand like spectres, waving their branches in the fitful breeze.</p>
               <p>"It was only a fancy," said Scipio to himself. "I must have fallen asleep, and was dreaming of danger."</p>
               <p>He was about sinking back into his former position, when his attention was again aroused by the snapping of a twig, and a slight rustling near him. He was in the act of reaching forward, for the purpose of awaking the still slumbering guide:—but before he had accomplished his purpose, the beautiful head of an animal of the deer species was thrust through a mass of vine, hanging from a stunted tree; it gazed on Scipio with its large melancholy eyes, in wondering curiosity. Its body was concealed from view behind its leafy screen. It was evidently unused to the sight of man. The sound of the murderous gun had never disturbed the tranquillity of its wilderness home. It had not yet learned to flee from the presence of the self-styled lords of creation, as the relentless destroyer of its kind. Certainly the being upon whom it gazed was an exception to the general rule; for, unless the act was one of necessity, Scipio was not the man to deprive any thing of life. No wanton pang of violence or cruelty was ever felt by animals placed under his care. Even the wild denizens of the forest might remain undisturbed by his presence. For a long time he gazed on the graceful head of the timid little creature, admiring its confidence in venturing so near, but at the same time thinking that had it ventured thus when his companion was awake, it might have repented its temerity. At length the shrill voice of a bird of the jay species, who had perched on a withered limb over its head, scared it from the spot, and Scipio heard the light bounding of its hoofs as it fled into the forest. Then the bird, hopping upon another branch, screamed again in its discordant notes, this time awakening the negro, who started to his feet with terror in his looks.<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6179-00000126"/> Seeing no one but Scipio quietly seated on a fallen tree, he appeared ashamed of this show of weakness; but observing the bird perched on a tree, he pointed to it and said,—</p>
               <p>"Bad spirit, speak evil in de ears ob sleepers; me scare him away;" and taking up a stout club he threw it with all his force, striking the limb on which the jay had settled itself, and was turning round displaying his beautiful form with all the vanity of a city coxcomb. At the unexpected assault upon his comely person, he gave an angry scream, and flew far away, quite out of sight.</p>
               <p>In vain Scipio sought to convince the negro that the bird could have no bad influence upon them. After a time he remained silent, but was evidently firm in the faith of its being an evil spirit of the wilderness.</p>
               <p>They were ascending the mountain-side when Scipio related his adventures with the deer. The negro at once assured him that the pretty creature was a good and happy spirit that had come there to watch over them and warn them of danger; but the bird was a bad spirit, and being stronger than the other had driven it away. Scipio saw before him a specimen of the people he was going to endeavour to convert to Christianity; not in his own strength, or he would have utterly despaired of ever accomplishing his purpose. He remembered, that though, to man, it might appear impossible, yet all things are possible to Almighty power;—that he who could unstop the deaf ear, and remove the veil from the outward vision, could also command the spiritual darkness to depart, and fill the soul with the glorious light of his presence.</p>
               <p>The ascent of the mountain was steep and laborious; the men toiled perseveringly on their way. It was high noon when they reached the summit. Upon turning a point of rocks, the valley became visible. Scipio involuntarily started backward, and uttered an exclamation of surprise. There was something so familiar in the scene before him<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6179-00000127"/> that he could hardly realize the fact that it was really the first time he had ever beheld the fair valley stretched at the mountain's base, its smooth stream winding its sinuous course, like a thread of silver; while thickly dotted along its banks were seen the plantain-covered huts of the natives.</p>
               <p>A thousand varied emotions rushed tumultuously through his brain; and throwing himself on the ground, he lifted his heart in thanksgiving to God, for permitting the chieftain's son to return to the tribe of his fathers with a purpose so noble. Here let us take leave of this truly courageous disciple, hoping that his mission may be accomplished, even to his most sanguine desire, and that he may reap a bountiful harvest, after he has borne the heat and burden of the day, and enjoy a peaceful old age, surrounded by loving Christian friends.</p>

               <p>LET us again turn our attention to what is transpiring in the family of Mr. De Lacy. That gentleman has been home only a short time, having been absent many weeks, during which time he has travelled over several of the Western States, and finally selected a tract of land in Michigan, not many miles from the flourishing city of Detroit. The farm land could not properly be called hilly; it was a succession of gentle risings and depressions, generally termed rolling land;—a kind of soil capable of a high state of cultivation. On the southern part a broad meadow extended, through which flowed a fine stream. To the north stretched many acres of woodland, capable<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6179-00000128"/> of producing some of the finest timber in the world.</p>
               <p>All this was described by Mr. De Lacy to his wife and children; who were anxious to have the preparations for removing carried on as speedily as possible. The old-fashioned log house, with its steep roof running down below the eaves, and the great stone chimney, was humorously described to the children by their father. This house was to serve as a temporary home for the family until a more convenient one could be erected.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy wished to be there while their future residence was being built, and superintend the work himself. The plan he expected to procure in Philadelphia; for he intended visiting that city, on their westward journey, and spending a few days with his valued friend, Mr. Ross. Emily, too, was anxious to see her former home again. The twins, also, were delighted at the prospect of seeing their kind nurse once more. She had removed to Philadelphia several weeks previously viously, under the care of kind old Mr. Ross. At last all was in readiness for the journey. The black men with their wives and little ones, and Mr. De Lacy's goods were sent westward with a trusty person, and nothing remained to be done, but to take a last look at the dear old mansion and the beautiful grounds that surrounded it. There was a look of sorrow in the dark eyes of Mr. De Lacy, as they passed in sight of the now deserted quarters. Was he thinking of the past, when his wretched slaves pined under the cruelties of a hard-hearted overseer, unheeded and uncared for by their master? Or was it in prospect of their being again tenanted by bondsmen, who would spend their lives in unrequited toil? How many scenes of anguish had these old walls been witness to! Heart-rending shrieks of woe, such as might move almost the very stones to pity, as babes were torn from frantic mothers' arms and sold to flinty-hearted traders; or the deep groans of sorrow-stricken<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6179-00000129"/> men, as they lay prostrate within their desolate homes,—when, after a day of toil, on returning weary from the field, they found that the loved partners of their humble hearth had been cruelly snatched away and sold they knew not whither, while his terrorstricken babes mourned for their absent mother, and eagerly besought him to bring back that dear parent.</p>
               <p>All this was past now;—gone forever, as regarded himself;—but would they not be re-enacted by another? The very thought sickened him, and covering his eyes with his hand he earnestly petitioned the God of all mercy to look down in pity, and stay the tide of woe that ingulfs those helpless beings. When he looked out again, the carriage had rolled past the limits of the plantation. Before long they were at the depot, and the whole family, seated in the cars, were swiftly borne on their northward journey.</p>
               <p>The children were delighted with the varied beauties of the country through which they passed, and never wearied in gazing out of the windows at the rapidly shifting scene. Childhood is ever pleased with novelty and change, and the twins were no exception to the general rule. Yet, like their parents, they were well satisfied when the cars came to a halt at the depot in Philadelphia. They were much fatigued with their journey, and pleased to find themselves at the end.</p>
               <p>Emily had just stepped from the platform, when she was embraced by her father, who was waiting there unobserved by his daughter. Tears of joy filled her eyes as she received his paternal kiss. Then turning to the twins, who were standing near, she presented them to Mr. Mayland as her children. He warmly welcomed them, and taking the hand of William led the way to the ladies' saloon, followed by Emily and Ella. They found Mrs. Mayland and Eddie there. He had grown to be quite a tall boy, and looked very manly in his jacket and pantaloons. He evidently thought himself of much more<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6179-00000130"/> importance than during his pinafore days. He had lost much of his timidity of disposition; and when his sister held out her hand, he immediately came to her side. As Emily sat conversing with Mrs. Mayland, she was pleased to mark the change in the deportment of that lady. Much of her impatience and bluntness of manner was gone, and in its place a gentleness that was much more agreeable to her daughter.</p>
               <p>"Where is Mr. De Lacy, Emily? I have not had the pleasure of seeing him yet," said Mrs. Mayland.</p>
               <p>"I suspect he is with father, seeing to the baggage," answered Emily.</p>
               <p>"I see papa and two other gentlemen," said Eddie, who was standing at the door; "and here they all come," he added, as his father entered, followed by Mr. De Lacy and Mr. Ross.</p>
               <p>"Happy to see you!" said the old gentleman, heartily, as he cordially grasped Emily's hand in his. "How well you are looking after your long journey! Ah! here are the little folks. Servant, Miss Ella," he said good-humoredly. "Got a kiss for an old friend? That's a little lady," he said, as the child touched her cherry lips to his. "But I must return so great a compliment," added he, as he kissed her fair brow. "How are you, my boy?" said he, shaking the proffered hand of William. "So you are going to be a backwoodsman. Take care the bears don't carry you off. I don't think that will be likely to happen, unless you should travel farther west than W—— County."</p>
               <p>"The bears have deserted that neighborhood long ago; and, like the Indians, have disappeared, leaving it in possession of a civilized race," said Mr. De Lacy.</p>
               <p>"Come, ladies and gentlemen, the carriage is in waiting," said Mr. Mayland, as he again made his appearance in the saloon.</p>
               <p>"Nay, Mr. Ross, don't think of going home," said Mrs. Mayland, as the old gentleman was about taking leave, when he had<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6179-00000131"/> seen the ladies and gentlemen comfortably seated in the carriage. "Do oblige us, and make one of the company this evening. Can't you persuade Mr. Ross to get in, Emily?" said Mrs. Mayland.</p>
               <p>"Come, here is a seat by me, Mr. Ross," said Emily, smiling. "I want to talk with you. I have scarcely had time to see you yet."</p>
               <p>"Well, I see I must yield to the ladies," said Mr. Ross, laughing, as he took his seat by Emily. Mr. De Lacy followed him in.</p>
               <p>The driver put up the steps, closed the door, mounted the box, and drove off at a rapid rate. It seemed to the children that they had hardly been seated, before the vehicle came to a stand in front of Mr. Mayland's residence.</p>
               <p>"That's my home," whispered Eddie to Ella, as they stood looking out of the carriage window.</p>
               <p>He was attracted to the little girl, whose frank and affectionate manners soon won his love and confidence; while he evidently regarded her twin brother with the respect due to one of older growth. Whenever he addressed William, he dropped the confidential whisper, and spoke aloud.</p>
               <p>They were met at the door by Mr. Mayland, who, Mr. Ross laughingly declared, must have got along faster than the horses.</p>
               <p>"My steed had but one to carry, and he is fleeter of foot than many others," said Mr. Mayland, as the gentlemen entered the parlor.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Mayland, Emily, and Ella went up stairs to change their dresses and prepare for tea. The bell had rung as they came into the room where the gentlemen were sitting. Mrs. Mayland, taking little Ella by the hand, proceeded at once to the dining-room. Mr. Mayland offered his arm to his daughter, and invited Mr. Ross and his son-in-law to walk out to tea; at the same time bidding Eddie to ask William.</p>
               <p>"Tea is ready," said the little boy in a<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6179-00000132"/> respectful voice to William, who was standing at the centre-table busily engaged in turning over the leaves of a book that contained some handsome engravings, and had not observed that the others were leaving the room. He looked up and smiled pleasantly at Eddie,—who said,—</p>
               <p>"Will you come with me?"</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, I did not hear the bell," said William, as he gave his hand to Eddie, who led him to a seat at the table beside Mr. De Lacy.</p>
               <p>"Why, you are quite a little man, Master Eddie!" said William's papa, as he stroked the curly head of the pleased little boy.</p>
               <p>"Where has the high chair gone?" said Emily, as Eddie seated himself at his mother's side.</p>
               <p>"Oh! he has thought himself too large to sit in a high chair, for some time. He wished it taken out of the dining-room altogether, after he discarded pinafores," said Mrs. Mayland, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Shall I see you early to-morrow morning, Mr. De Lacy?" said Mr. Ross, inquiringly, as they arose from the table.</p>
               <p>"Yes, if convenient for you to accompany me, I wish to see Mr. ——, the Architect, as soon as possible. What is your opinion of the sketch I have drawn? It is merely to give the gentleman an idea of the plan which I wish him to draw of our residence. This represents the front," said he, as he pointed to certain lines on the paper.</p>
               <p>"I hardly think the builders will need a more perfect draft to go by than this of yours," said Mr. Mayland, who had been viewing the drawing over his son-in-law's shoulder.</p>
               <p>"That's my opinion, too," said Mr. Ross.</p>
               <p>"Well, at any rate, I would like to show it to him. Perhaps he could suggest some improvements," said Mr. De Lacy, as he folded up the paper.</p>
               <p>"It might be advisable. I am entirely at<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6179-00000133"/> your service," said Mr. Ross, taking up his hat.</p>
               <p>"We must try and call on Aunt Rose, to-morrow: it will delight her to have you visit her; and I want you to see how snug she looks in her little home."</p>
               <p>"Yes, do, Vincent," said Emily, "call as early in the day as you can, and tell her I want her to come here."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Mamma," said Ella, running up to her, "is papa going to see Aunt Rose, and will she come here to-morrow?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my love, your papa will expect to see her in the morning, and most likely, if she is well, she will be here as soon as possible."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I shall be so very glad to see our dear old nurse," said the affectionate child, as she bounded out of the room to find her brother, and impart the good tidings to him. William's joy at the announcement was as deep and heart-felt as his sister's, but was shown in a quieter way. Eddie regarded the twins with looks of wonder,—that they could be so pleased at the prospect of meeting a colored woman.</p>
               <p>"Did you ever see Aunt Rose, Eddie?" asked Ella.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I seen her at Mr. Ross', one day," answered he.</p>
               <p>"Oh! didn't you love her?—she is so good and kind!" said the little girl; her eyes brightening at the thought of so soon seeing her.</p>
               <p>"No, I didn't; her's brack. I don't love brack people much," said Eddie, decisively, "and I didn't know that she was your aunt."</p>
               <p>"Neither is she," said William, laughing. "She is not our aunt. We only call her so. Papa and every body calls her Aunt Rose." Eddie looked as if he did not exactly understand why every body should acknowledge relationship to her; but he remained silent, determining in his mind, that <emph>he,</emph> certainly, never would call a brack woman aunt; and<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6179-00000134"/> as to loving her, that was quite out of the question.</p>
               <p>In fulfilment of his engagement, Mr. De Lacy was at his friend's house at an early hour on the following day, and the two gentlemen soon after called on Mr. ——. They found him in his office. He carefully examined Mr. De Lacy's sketch,—thought a house built in that manner would be admirably adapted to the country. It would be large and airy, with all the modern conveniences; but destitute of those frail, showy cuttings and carvings which some call adornments, but which really disfigure many otherwise handsome buildings.</p>
               <p>"I cannot but admire your judgment. There is a substantial beauty in houses built in that style. I think it an evidence of a want of taste, when I see so much fancy-work, particularly on houses in the country. It looks, to my mind, like carrying the city out of its proper place; but I would suggest," said he, again taking up the plan, "that the kitchen be built here. It would be an improvement, I think; and the hall door should be wider, according to my judgment."</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy took the paper from the architect's hand, and examined it again.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," he said, as he handed it back to Mr. ——, "the door-way being widened would improve the looks of the front. I wish you to make me another draft, with such additions as you may think requisite. Have it finished at your earliest convenience, and send it to Mr. Mayland, in —— street," said Mr. De Lacy, as he left the office.</p>
               <p>"I will attend to it immediately," said Mr. ——, as he bowed to the gentlemen, and closed the office door.</p>

               <p>"WHERE is it Aunt Rose lives?" asked Mr. De Lacy, as he and Mr. Ross moved slowly down the side walk.</p>
               <p>"In German Street, near Fourth," answered the old gentleman. "Shall we call there now?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Mr. De Lacy, "the children will be impatient to see her, and, to tell the truth, I am anxious to hear how she enjoys a life of freedom. While with me, she did not feel the necessity of exertion, in supporting herself, as no doubt she now does."</p>
               <p>"Well, you shall soon have the satisfaction of seeing and hearing for yourself," said Mr. Ross, "for here is her door."</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy glanced up at the humble little edifice, which, despite its diminutive size, had an unmistakable air of comfort, evidenced by the snowy white curtains that hung at the front windows, and by the well scoured brass knocker and cleanly scrubbed steps, on which they were standing.</p>
               <p>The front door was unclosed and Mr. Ross had just removed his hand from the aforesaid knocker, when an inner door opened, and the well remembered head of Aunt Rose, encased as usual in a gaudy-colored Madras handkerchief, was thrust through the apperture. One glance was sufficient; and pushing open the door, she exclaimed, "Bress the Lord, if here aint Mars'r De Lacy!" and seizing his outstretched hand, she shook it again and again with great heartiness.</p>
               <p>"Why, how are yer, and Miss Emily and de dear chillen? Beg yer pardon," she said, with ready politeness, as she, at this instant, observed Mr. Ross, who was standing back of his friend. "I was so flustered-like at seein' Mars'r standin' yer, dat I didn't notice<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6179-00000136"/> yer. Walk in, I want to hear all about Mars'r William and Miss Ella."</p>
               <p>They are in the city with me, Aunt Rose, and Mrs. De Lacy wishes you to go around to No.103 in —— Street, this afternoon, if you can. We are stopping at Mr. Mayland's Mrs. De Lacy's father. The twins are impatient to see you."</p>
               <p>"Now are dey?—de bressed lambs! yes, indeed!—I'll go right after dinner. How does Miss Emily like movin' West?"</p>
               <p>"She is well satisfied with the idea," answered Mr. De Lacy.</p>
               <p>"But how do you like living north, and providing for yourself, by this time?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! I'm gettin' along first-rate, Mars'r," answered Aunt Rose. "Mr. Ross was so kind as to get me dis yer house, and recommended my gals to some of his acquaintance. De're both at sarvice now, in a quaker family. Nelly does de cookin' and Sally helps with de chamber work, and minds de chillen. Dey both like de place, and get good wages. Der Missus told me, todder day, dat dey were de best helps she had eber had in her house."</p>
               <p>"Well, that is encouraging, Aunt Rose," said Mr. De Lacy, "I hope they may continue to merit the good opinion of their employer. And so I suppose you like living north better than in Kentucky."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mars'r, I do indeed. I like de idea ob bein' free and workin' for myself, and den I hab no fears for de gals now, ob dere bein' ill used, or may be sold away. I'member de drefful feelins' I had," said Aunt Rose in a husky voice, "when old Mars'r sold my little boy. 'Twas about two years before yer bought me. He was near about eight months old; a fine peart little fellow he was, too, and knowed me so well. He'd just waked up from his afternoon's nap, and I carried him to de kitchen door, and sot him on the grass, jest outside. I used to cook at ole Mars'r's, and I was busy at work cleanin' up, when all at once I heard my baby give a scream, and throwin' down de towel I was usin', I<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6179-00000137"/> hurried to look out. Dere stood ole Mars'r and another man. De stranger had my baby in his arms, and jest as I got to de door, he jumped into a carriage and druv off. I thought I'd hab gone distracted. I prayed to de Lord to take me out ob my sore trouble; for I thought I never could live on without my baby. It 'peared like dat I allers had his little face before me eyes, jest how he looked strugglin' to get to me." Here poor Aunt Rose completely gave way, and though many years had passed over her head since that mournful event, yet the deep wound remained unhealed: for what can bring forgetfulness to a mother's heart, or still its yearnings for an absent child? Not even the bright eyes and prattling voices of her little girls could efface from her mind that last look of the terrified infant, when it found itself held fast in the arms of a stranger. She never heard of him afterwards, but she needed no one to tell her his sufferings, torn away from her arms, and beyond her maternal care. Mr. De Lacy had heard this story before, and had noticed the sad, drooping figure of Aunt Rose after he bought her, going patiently about her various duties; yet it had never affected him as the recital did then. All the horrors of the slave system arose before him, and he inwardly exclaimed, "How can persons who practise such outrages on humanity, expect to go unpunished? Surely the God of justice will remember his suffering and oppressed children, and smite the oppressor with the rod of his wrath."</p>
               <p>Good old Mr. Ross was deeply pained and indignant at the sad story, and in his heart thanked God that the evil existed not in the Keystone State, and also that his valued friend had come out from the evil, having ceased to be a partaker thereof. After sitting in silence for a few minutes, until Aunt Rose had in some degree recovered her calmness, the gentlemen arose and took their leave.</p>
               <p>"Please tell de chillen, I'll be dar directly<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6179-00000138"/> arter dinner," said Aunt Rose, as Mr. De Lacy stepped upon the pavement.</p>
               <p>"You will, most likely, be there before me," answered Mr. De Lacy.</p>
               <p>For some time the two walked on without speaking.</p>
               <p>At length the silence was broken by Mr. De Lacy.</p>
               <p>"I think slavery never before appeared to my mind as it really exists in this country. It seems to me our condition is somewhat similar to the Jewish nation. Like them the blessings of indulgent Heaven are spread with a lavish hand over the length and breadth of our country;—we are called to obedience; like them we turn away from the Lord's teachings, our hearts filled with rebellious pride. They crowned their iniquities by crucifying their Redeemer and King, and were driven for their disobedience and unbelief from home and country, and scattered to the ends of the earth, and became a by-word and a jest. Are not those who are thus cruelly oppressing a helpless people, by their actions declaring that they "will not have this man to rule over them?" Though they may bear the name of Christians, yet their deeds prove them to be "none of his." Did not our Saviour, while on earth, declare that "inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these, ye did it unto me?" Have they not then as much crucified his meek and loving Spirit, and abused and buffeted suffering humanity as ever did the persecuting Jews? When I ponder on these things, I tremble for my country. Ay! and would fain cry abroad, "Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die?" "The Lord is long-suffering, and slow to anger," and in his loving-kindness, bears long with his stiff-necked and rebellious children; yet his justice will not slumber forever, nor the time for recompense be delayed. The African was brought from his native land by violence, and detained in slavery, generation after generation, by his cruel oppressors, and will,<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6179-00000139"/> I firmly believe, if not emancipated, be ere long, an instrument of dire punishment upon this guilty nation, which, though now it towers aloft, secure in its strength, like some strong oak of the forest that defies the force of the storms without, yet yields to the insidious insect gnawing at its vitals, whose subtle workings were disregarded until too late to save the stately giant from decay,—even so will this evil, extending itself year after year, if not arrested, surely destroy the noble structure of our Commonwealth."</p>
               <p>"Your sentiments on this subject, my friend, are very similar to my own," said Mr. Ross, "and I trust that in future no more territory will be admitted as slave states. Circumscribed by its present limits, it must, before long, be done away with, and may God speed the day of general emancipation! But here we are at home. Come, I will take no denial. You must remain to dinner, and realize what a good meal an old bachelor can get up."</p>
               <p>While the gentlemen are discussing their viands, let us look in at Mr. Mayland's. Aunt Rose has just arrived, and little Ella is wild with joy, at the sight of the ebon face of her dearly loved nurse. She is sitting in Aunt Rose's lap. Her rounded arms are twined about her neck, and her curly head is leaning affectionately upon the bosom of her faithful and trust-worthy old friend. William is standing by the side of Aunt Rose. His hand is resting on her shoulder. "Bress de darlin's!—how glad I am to see 'em," she said, as tears of joy coursed each other rapidly down her cheeks. "I was afeard, Miss Emily, dat you wouldn't come dis way; and den I'd neber get to sot my eyes on yer and de twins agin. Is dat Mr. Mayland's little lad?" asked Aunt Rose, who observed Eddie, for the first time. He was standing a short distance off, gazing at the group before him with looks of wonder and astonishment, not unmixed with an expression of disgust. His appearance was very<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6179-00000140"/> amusing to Emily, who could not forbear smiling at the countenance of her little brother.</p>
               <p>"Come here, Eddie," said Ella, when the delight of meeting had subsided, and holding out her little hand. "Come here, and speak to Aunt Rose." The child slowly advanced; his large black eyes fixed half fearfully on the woman's face.</p>
               <p>"Why, I do believe de little dear is feared of me," said Aunt Rose. "I wouldn't hurt yer, honey," she said encouragingly, at the same time holding out to him a small cake, which she had taken from her pocket.</p>
               <p>"He is not accustomed to seeing colored persons, and is a little timid," said Emily.</p>
               <p>"Here, Miss Ella, yer give it to him, will yer?" said Aunt Rose. "I think he wants de cake, but he's afeard to take it." Ella slipped off of her old friend's knee, and taking the cake from her hand, went to where Eddie was standing, and offered it to him. He took it, and in a low tone asked her something. Ella, smilingly, repeated his thanks to Aunt Rose, who was busily engaged relating to her young missus, as she still called Emily, the many excellences of the worthy couple in whose house her girls found employment.</p>
               <p>"And den dey gives me dere fine washin' and ironin' to do, and have told der friends about me, till I hev plenty ob work. Dey allers pays well, de quaker people; but dere cur'os, though; dey talk jest like de good book, sayin' thee and thou, and callin' Sunday de first day ob de week. I like to hear de ole lady and gentleman talkin' to each other. It sounds so mild and quiet like. Dey hab de first cross word to say to either ob de gals yet; but I must go, I hab some clothes to take home dis afternoon. I wish yer would come and see my house, Miss Emily, and bring de twins and dis little man. Yer'll soon get acquainted with Aunt Rose," said she to Eddie, as she smoothed back his jetty curls with her broad palm.</p>
               <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6179-00000141"/>
               <p>"Yes," answered Emily, "I want to pay you a visit, to-morrow afternoon, if possible. We shall make but a short stay in the city. Mr. De Lacy is anxious to be in Michigan."</p>
               <p>"Look for us all to-morrow afternoon," called out Ella from the parlor window.</p>
               <p>"Yes, honey," answered Aunt Rose, as her stately figure disappeared around the corner.</p>
               <p>The following morning, after Aunt Rose's visit, proved rainy, and continued so through out the day, much to the disappointment of the children, who had been promised a ride to Fairmount and a visit to Aunt Rose, as they were returning; but as Ella complained of not feeling well, Emily thought it advisable to remain at home.</p>
               <p>"Then we will call early to-morrow morning, Ella," said her father. "Don't you think my dear," said he, turning to Emily, "that we could make ready to resume our journey by Thursday? Mr. —— will send me the plan for our house to-day, I suppose; and I am anxious to be there, so as to have the work commenced as soon as possible." And so it was settled to leave the city for their future home on the aforementioned day.</p>

               <p>LET us pass over the time that intervened, and take the cars bound westward, in which we find our friends already seated. There are traces of tears in Emily's eyes; but she is endeavoring to hide her sorrow, and converse cheerfully with her husband and children. Mr. De Lacy is showing her the alterations made in the plan, by the architect, and explaining to her the changes it will make in the appearance of the building, until, despite her grief at parting from her loved parents, she became almost as much interested as her husband. It was with glad hearts our travellers took leave of the cars at —— station tion, near their future home. The children almost cried for joy, at beholding the familiar face of Nero, standing among a number of people, who were surrounding the train.</p>
               <p>"Bress de little ones! how glad dey be to see old Nero!" delightedly exclaimed he, as he grasped their hands, within his huge palm. "How is missus?" he said, turning to where Emily was standing, and respectfully removing his hat. "How are yer, mars'r?" and with the grip of a giant, he shook Mr. De Lacy's hand, until that gentleman winced under the hearty pressure.</p>
               <p>"How happens it, Nero, that you are here to-day?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! I'se been spectin' yer dere two days, yer see. I was here yesterday, and stayed till de cars come."</p>
               <p>"Then I suppose you intended coming daily until we did arrive," said Mr. De Lacy, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Spect mars'r near about right dar," answered the man, turning away.</p>
               <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6179-00000143"/>
               <p>"Now, I hope you'll not get out of heart, at the sight of our home, Emily," said her husband, as they drew near to the spot. "It will, no doubt, appear strange and inconvenient to you; but before long, our new house will be built with every convenience."</p>
               <p>"Don't be uneasy on my account, dear Vincent. I am not one to be easily discouraged by trifles. What a magnificent prospect there is, from this rising slope!"</p>
               <p>Mr. De Lacy, smiled.</p>
               <p>"I had selected that spot as the site of our residence, and am particularly pleased that you admire it."</p>
               <p>"Permit me to compliment you, my love, on the taste you have, in my opinion, displayed in the selection of the situation."</p>
               <p>"Those grounds, properly laid out, will appear to great advantage, I think," said Mr. De Lacy, as they turned in at a private road, or what is called, by country people, a lane, and in a few minutes they were, at their home. There they were met by Peter and the two women with their children. All hands were delighted at again seeing Mars'r De Lacy and their gentle mistress. The twins were immediately taken into the house by Jane and Philis, two well grown girls, daughters of Nero. Emily found the house nicely arranged. The women had evidently consulted her comfort, in all they did; and she felt grateful to them for it, and expressed her thanks, praising the neatness and order they had displayed.</p>
               <p>"Now, this is beautiful!" she said, as she entered the room they had fitted as a sitting-room for the family. "Do look here, children!" she called to the twins, who were passing the door. "Come, look at these lovely flowers, how prettily they are arranged!"</p>
               <p>"That was my Philis' work," said the elder of the women. "She's a good bit obtaste fixin' things."</p>
               <p>"I shall take her, I think, to wait on me and the children, in place of Aunt Rose,"<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6179-00000144"/> said Emily. The woman looked pleased, and thanking Emily, she left the room.</p>
               <p>Let us now pass over a period of two years, and again look in on our friends. They have removed to their newly erected home, which contains every comfort and convenience. Nero and Peter, with their well grown boys, find plenty for their hands to do, and labor diligently under the superintendence of their generous-hearted employer, while the female department is no less busy. Emily still superintends the education of the twins, but expects to lose one of her pupils at the close of the year,—Mr. De Lacy wishing to place William at a boys' school near Boston, where he is to remain, until he is sufficiently advanced in his studies to enter college. Ella is to remain longer under her mother's care. A boarding-school is sometimes talked of, but she shakes her pretty head when the subject is mentioned, and with grave looks, clings closely to her mother's side, as though it would be quite impossible for them to be parted. The twins look forward with dread to the separation, but as almost a year must elapse, they put the evil day from them, and, happy in the present, they think but little of what the future may bring. Mr. De Lacy is a man prominent in his neighborhood, well beloved for his many virtues, and respected for his superior talents. Happy in the possession of a conscience void of offence, he can truly say, that he has found in religion all that is really worth striving for, all that can ever satisfy the soul of man, or make it capable of enjoying true happiness; while his pureminded wife, the ever-willing companion in all his schemes for benefiting mankind, often lifts her heart, in gratitude, that she had ever been strengthened to perform the first small act of duty. Little did she think, when she commenced her task, of the great and good results that would ensue; for while<pb n="288" xml:id="VAC6179-00000145"/> yet in the morning of life, she feels herself rewarded, and is gathering fruit abundantly from the good seed she has sown in the hearts of others.</p>
