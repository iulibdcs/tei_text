            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN introducing the story of ESTELLE GRANT to the public the author does not think it
               necessary to say much in the way of preface, for two reasons, one of which is that he
               has no particular purpose to serve by going into a long preliminary discourse, and
               the other is that very few would pay any attention to it if he had an object, and
               should show it. "Men are but children of a larger growth," and either in reading or
               listening to a story, they are apt to grow impatient at circumlocution, and to wish
               that the narrator would "come to the point" at once—a quality of mind which was well
               exemplified in the case of the sailor who grew tired of Mr. Macready's frequent
               demands for the handkerchief when addressing Desdemona, in the character of the
               jealous Moor, and who at length called upon the tragedian to adopt the method
               generally resorted to by juveniles when troubled with catarrh, and let the play
               proceed. Keeping this fact in view, the author will be as brief as possible with this
               portion of his task, feeling satisfied that by so doing he will not only save himself
               labor, but avoid the danger of tiring his readers at the same time.</p>
            <p>There are few narratives even among those drawn from the captivating store-house of
               fiction, and touched up with the cunning skill of a Dickens, a Dumas, or a Sue, which
               possesses greater interest than the exciting story of<pb n="iv-v"
                  xml:id="VAC6405-00000003"/> "The Lost Wife," drawn, although it is from real life,
               and destitute of all coloring other than that which a rounding up, as it were, of
               rough edges, and the successful linking together of a concatenation of circumstances
               render necessary. The characters introduced are pen and ink portraits of real
               persons, most of whom may be regarded as types of their different classes, and some
               of whom are yet living, and will either swear or weep over these pages as the case
               may be. One of these latter parties the author was obliged early in the story to
                  <emph>kill,</emph> but the homicide should be regarded as entirely justifiable,
               not only because the individual was unfit to live, but because his death was
               necessary to the lucid pointing out of a most excellent moral.</p>
            <p>It is always a more gratifying task to the correct-minded and benevolent writer to
               discourse of virtue and its reward than of vice and its punishment; still wickedness
               and wrong should be exposed, that the unwary may be warned of its snares and arts.
               The world should be made to know that all are not pure who assume the saintly garb of
               Christianity, and that even among the outcasts of society there is many a noble heart
               crushed beneath the iron heel of a class of as heartless oppressors, under the cloak
               of religion, as the Great Creator of the Universe ever permitted to exist on his
               footstool, to mar the beauty and harmony of his creations. The worm will turn if
               trampled upon, and that deep sense of wrong which has a place in every human breast,
               will often rankle in the hearts of the injured and oppressed till it takes the shape
               of criminal vengeance, and before we harshly condemn the errors of a brother or
               sister, we ought to know the history of the offence and the cause which led to it.
               The poor suicides who end life by poison, the knife, the pistol or by a plunge into
               the dark waters of the ocean, have each a fearful history of his or her own, which,
               to the world, is, in most instances, a sealed book, which, if opened, would draw
               tears of sympathy to moisten their premature graves from the eyes of all to whom the
               revelation was made. The author does not wish to offer any apology, however, for the
               dreadful crimes of which his heroine was guilty—he merely wishes to draw attention to
               the fact that she might, under different circumstances, have been a different woman,
               and to urge upon those whose mission it is to search after and reclaim the erring and
               depraved, the necessity of a more thorough organization in the prosecution of their
               labor of love. Let them exert themselves night and day to unmask those wolves in
               sheep's clothing who are too often, alas! to be found in their midst—let them also
               extend their saving influence far and wide—let their beneficent arms encircle the
               homeless and the outcast in every section of our sin-laden city—let them penetrate
               the dark alley-ways where no sunlight enters, the subterranean abodes reeking with
               filth, the noisome dens in pestiferous courts, the homes of the wretched
               everywhere—to the end that the lost may be found, and the sick made whole. One great
               object of this book is to show the contrast between virtue and vice—the beauty of the
               former, and the hideousness of the latter—to confirm the pure of heart in their
               purity, and to warn those who stand upon the verge of danger to fly while there is
               yet time. That the day may speedily arrive when less real incident for the ground
               work of such a book as <emph>this</emph> can be found, is the sincere wish of the
               public's most humble servant,</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>IN the summer of 18—I went to spend a few weeks with a wealthy old gentleman
                  residing in one of the most beautiful of the numerous lovely towns lying along the
                  line of the poetry-inspiring Hudson. It was from no desire of my own that I did
                  so, as rural scenes have few charms for me—in fact the charge recently made
                  against Fanny Fern by an English writer, viz., that she 'had not a country hair in
                  her head,' would apply to me exactly—but the old gentleman aforesaid had been a
                  fast friend of my father's, and had been one of my sponsors in baptism—this he
                  thought, as my parents were both dead, gave him the right occasionally to demand
                  of me a visit, which he often did, and I never neglected to attend when he thus
                  summoned me, as was the case at the time of which I am writing.</p>
               <p>There are few towns within a hundred miles of New York that are more frequented
                  during the dog-days, than the beautiful one of ——, a fact which rendered it rather
                  more endurable rable to me than though it had been of the ultra-rural order. I
                  would most always meet with somebody from New York with whom I was acquainted, and
                  it not unfrequently happened that I met whole parties, in which latter case I was
                  not at a loss for amusement.</p>
               <p>My sponsor, whose real name it is not necessary for the purposes of this story to
                  give, I shall call Miller, was a bluff, hearty, jolly old bachelor, about sixty
                  years of age, who having made money enough to retire from business, had settled in
                  ——, determined to take the world easy for the rest of his days. The only persons
                  in his household were his housekeeper, (an eccentric old maid) and a negro boy,
                  who acted in the double capacity of house-servant and hostler.</p>
               <p>'Well, Harry, my boy,' said the old gentleman, as we sat on the piazza, each
                  enjoying a cheroot, shortly after my arrival, 'I'm rejoiced to see you looking so
                  well—shows you've taken care of yourself—you haven't been here now since summer
                  before last, and I hope you won't be in such a hurry as usual to get away again.
                  You ought to be able to enjoy yourself here for a few weeks very
                  comfortably—plenty of company—numberless beautiful drives—an excellent pleasure
                  boat, and plenty of first-rate fishing.'</p>
               <p>'I dare say I shall be able to pass the time very agreeably,' I replied, 'if I do
                  not I am satisfied it will be my own fault. But what's new here? Has anything
                  extraordinary happened since I was here last?'</p>
               <p>'Extraordinary!' echoed the old gentleman, 'No—I hate extraordinary things—nothing
                  of an extraordinary nature has ever happened here that I am aware of. Stop, now I
                  come to think of it, something a <emph>little</emph> extraordinary has happened
                  here within the last-year.'</p>
               <p>'And what is that?' questioned I, eagerly.</p>
               <p>'Why,' said he, 'a girl has taken the whole town by storm—that is, the masculine
                  portion of it—she is young, accomplished and beautiful—there is not a youngster in
                  the place<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6405-00000005"/> but would break his neck for
                  her—and yet the talk is that her father intends to force her to marry a man she
                  don't love. Everybody says she is a fine, modest, amiable girl, and yet she is not
                  to make her own choice of a husband. That's what I call extraordinary. At least,
                  if it ain't, it ought to be.'</p>
               <p>'What is the name of this to-be-sacrified divinity?' I inquired, laughingly.</p>
               <p>'Her name is Grant—Estelle Grant. Her father moved here with his family not quite
                  a year since, and it is rumored that the girl is to be married some time this
                  summer to the smooth-faced, oily-looking and wealthy deacon Emory.'</p>
               <p>'He that gave a thousand dollars to the mission fund when I was up here last?'
                  said I, inquiringly.</p>
               <p>'Yes,' replied the old gentleman, 'and took good care that the fact found its way
                  into the columns of every available newspaper.'</p>
               <p>'Well,' said I, 'I should think he would make a sorry-looking bridegroom for
                  anybody. You must know him pretty well, by this time; is he the hypocrite that
                  many here give him the credit of being?'</p>
               <p>'Well, the fact is,' replied the old gentleman, 'I cannot speak of my own
                  knowledge. I think it would be hard to <emph>prove</emph> any thing against him.
                  He bears an excellent character. That is, he owns a pew in church, attends divine
                  service regularly three times on the Sabbath, and all that sort of thing; but then
                  he's too austere; never laughs, never smiles, even; never sings—never dances—never
                  does anything that a true Christian, in my opinion, should do occasionally, and I
                  don't like him. I believe he's a hypocrite—I may be mistaken. I hope I am; but
                  that's my opinion, and I can't help it. But you'll see her and him both, it's
                  altogether likely, before you go away, and you can judge for yourself. As for me,
                  I don't pretend to be any judge of character: that is, I have no set rule for
                  judging a man or woman either. I've been mistaken so often in my life, that I've
                  dropped the habit of judging physiognomically or phrenologically, and depend
                  entirely upon my impressions; these lead me to dislike both Emory and Mr. Grant,
                  the girl's father; but I do like the girl herself, and think it's a hard case she
                  should be sacrificed. She's in the habit of coming here frequently. I have some
                  rare exotics in the garden, of which she is rather fond, and she often calls in to
                  admire them. But there's the bell, and now let's in to tea.'</p>
               <p>It was only two days following this conversation with my matter-of-fact,
                  good-hearted old sponsor, that I saw this paragon of whom report spoke so highly.
                  I had prepared myself to take a short drive, and while the Negro boy Tom was
                  getting the vehicle in readiness, I thought I would take a stroll through the
                  garden. As I walked leisurely along, admiring the floral beauties which greeted me
                  on every side, I heard voices just ahead of me in a little recess which shot out
                  from the avenue I was threading. I thought nothing of it at first, but continued
                  my walk in that direction, when, just before I reached the spot alluded to, my old
                  friend and a young lady, who followed close behind him, came directly across my
                  path.</p>
               <p>'Ah, Harry, well met, my boy. This is Miss Grant—Miss Grant, my scape grace
                  god-son Harry ——.'</p>
               <p>She acknowledged my presence by a graceful bend of her beautiful neck and blushed
                  deeply as the old gentleman introduced her. She was then about instantly to take
                  her departure, but the old gentleman cut off her retreat by playfully blocking the
                  passage, and remarked in a tone of pleasantry—</p>
               <p>'Don't run away, Miss Grant—Harry won't hurt you. He is as harmless as a
                  school-boy, although he does hail from that terrible city, New York. You haven't
                  spent half your usual time in examining your favorite flowers. Do stay and explain
                  their beauties to my god-son. He is a perfect ignoramus on the subject of
                  floriculture, and will thank you I know.'</p>
               <p>'I must plead guilty to the charge which my god-father so bluntly prefers,' said
                  I, for the first time addressing the beautiful creature, who in her confusion was
                  endeavoring to adjust<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6405-00000006"/> a small <hi
                     rend="i"/>boquet of fragrant flowers which she held in her hand, 'but it is
                  more my misfortune than my fault. Having been reared in the city, I have never
                  examined a collection of rare plants except at yearly exhibitions, and then I have
                  had no competent person to point out to me their chief beauties. I am sure,
                  though, I should prove an apt scholar under Miss Grant's tuition.'</p>
               <p>'Mr. Miller is pleased to give me credit for more knowledge than I really possess
                  in this regard,' she replied timidly as she raised her large, sparkling orbs to
                  mine—'I am but a poor judge of flowers myself, although I dearly love to cultivate
                  and be among them. At present, however, I must be going, for I have already staid
                  longer than I had intended and my father will be expecting me,' and dropping a
                  graceful curtsey she took her leave.</p>
               <p>It seemed as though a bright, fresh-looking, exquisite picture, drawn by one of
                  the old masters, had been suddenly taken from my view when she passed out of the
                  garden, so brilliant, so glorious did she seem in her almost unearthly beauty, and
                  when the sound of her light foot-fall had died away, I stood buried in profound
                  thought like one entranced. I was aroused from my silent attitude by a loud laugh
                  from my god-father, who merrily slapping me upon the shoulder exclaimed—</p>
               <p>'One more victim to the charms of Estelle Grant. One more heart cleft in twain by
                  the shaft of the Boy-God! Is she not beautiful, Harry? Egad, I don't know but I
                  should have fallen in love myself if I had met her, or a damsel like her, forty
                  years ago!'</p>
               <p>'She <emph>is</emph> beautiful!' sighing in spite of myself, as I took my way
                  towards the vehicle, which the black boy had informed me was in readiness.</p>
               <p>The time between my first meeting with Estelle Grant and that fixed upon for her
                  marriage with Everard Emory was brief, but it was sufficiently long for me to
                  become intimately acquainted with, and to gain a complete knowledge of her
                  character. When I first visited —— it was my intention to stay but a few weeks at
                  most, but while in her society, time had for me a greater value than ever before,
                  and I took no heed of the days, weeks and months, as they rapidly flew by. I
                  forgot all about New York, and thought that with Estelle for a companion I should
                  never wish to change my location. I managed to meet her very often in the old
                  gentleman's garden previous to her hateful marriage. Indeed, I not only managed to
                  meet her often, but with all the ardor of a youth of twenty-one, in spite of
                  myself I fell desperately in love with her, although I learned from her own lips
                  before our acquaintance ended, that there was not the slightest possibility of my
                  passion ever meeting with a return. She was of an open, social, ingenuous nature,
                  and seemed to take naturally to me, <emph>as a brother.</emph> I was certain that
                  she had not a particle of love, or even of respect, for the man to whom she was on
                  the point of being tied for life—not only from what my god-father had said, but
                  from her own actions. This gave me a ray of hope—and when a youth of twenty-one,
                  who is deeply in love, obtains a <emph>ray</emph> of hope, it is not long before
                  his sanguine nature magnifies it into a perfect flood of sunshine. Accordingly I
                  turned the matter over in my mind, and settled upon my course of action. I would
                  declare my love, I would propose an elopement, I would tear her from the grasp of
                  her iron-hearted parent by force if necessary, and break the head of Everard Emory
                  if he dared to interfere—I would take her to New York in triumph—I would appear
                  before my friends as the happiest husband of the best and prettiest wife in the
                  world—all this would I have done, but for one very important fact, which was
                  merely that such a thing was impossible, for just as I was about confessing to her
                  that I was dying for her sake, she opened her whole heart to me. She confessed
                  that she was forced to marry Emory against her inclinations. She was the victim of
                  circumstances over which she had no control.</p>
               <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6405-00000007"/>
               <p>She never could endure, much less love her intended husband, for her heart was
                  plighted to another—one whom she had known from childhood.</p>
               <p>Let me not dwell upon the subject. Estelle Grant was married to Everard Emory, in
                  the presence of a perfect blaze of beauty and fashion. She was offered up a
                  sacrifice upon the altar of mammon—match-making mothers and money-getting fathers
                  said it was an excellent alliance. Emory stood high in the community. He was a
                  model man. His morals were unexceptionable, and his wealth boundless. Estelle
                  should consider herself fortunate in securing such a match. She should be the
                  happiest of women. Should she? We shall see.</p>
               <p>I did not witness the marriage, although invited to be present. I could not do so.
                  The sight would have been gall and wormwood to me, but I staid in —— till the
                  ceremony was performed, and then I returned to New York and to business.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>Two years had passed after the marriage of Estelle, during the whole of which time
                  I had never once visited my old godfather, although I corresponded with him
                  regularly. In almost every letter which I received from him he had something to
                  say about Estelle and the effect upon her mind and disposition which the alliance
                  into which she had been forced had produced, She had one child—a son—and the old
                  gentleman gave me to understand that her nature had totally changed—that I would
                  not know her—that Estelle Emory was no more like Estelle Grant than day was like
                  night. His remarks to this effect kept growing more and more pointed, till at
                  length one day the postman put into my hand the following characteristic epistle
                  from the old gentleman:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>'DEAR HARRY: The jig is up at last. The bird has flown. Estelle Emory, whose
                     life, since her marriage, seems to have been a perfect hell, left here last
                     night, and has gone no one knows whither, though it is surmised that she fled
                     to New York. She took her infant with her, and was accompanied in her flight by
                     the servant girl, who seems to have changed, with her mistress, into a perfect
                     devil. If you should see her in New York, Harry, do not let harm come to
                     her—watch over her as you would over a sister. I feel almost as great an
                     affection for her as though she was my daughter, and would go a great way to
                     serve her. But don't prevail upon her to come I don't think that would be doing
                     her a kindness. Only<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6405-00000008"/> don't let her
                     become the victim of any of the despicable characters who literally swarm in
                     New York. Search for her at once, my dear boy, and if you find her, advise me
                     instantly. God bless you! Your affectionate god-father.'</p>
               </q>
               <p>Poor old man! He never learned anything of her fate, for it was not long after her
                  flight that he was called upon to pay that debt which all must sooner or later
                  pay. He died leaving me his sole heir.</p>
               <p>His death, however, did not prevent my searching after Estelle. Day after day, and
                  month after month, I was constantly on the alert, and although some facts of a
                  startling nature concerning her and the companion of her flight, came to my
                  knowledge, I could learn nothing of her whereabouts, and at length I became
                  satisfied that she was either dead, or had, in her desire to get as far as
                  possible from her husband, taken passage for Europe.</p>
               <p>While industriously looking after information concerning the victim of parental
                  cupidity, I made the acquaintance of a member of the police department, whom I
                  shall call Fred Fox—a fearless, good-natured, garrulous fellow, always active in
                  his profession; a man of keen perception, a first-rate judge of character, and
                  perfectly willing at all times to furnish me with the fullest particulars of every
                  case which came under his observation. This last fact led me to take up my abode
                  in his family, in order that I might have the full benefit of his experience, and
                  that I might also have a better opportunity of listening to his narrations. Many a
                  long winter's evening, when Fred was off duty, have I passed beneath his roof.
                  Seated near him, with eyes, ears and mouth all open at the same time, I have
                  listened, as Desdemona devoured up the discourse of Othello, to his recital of his
                  experience during many years' service as a policeman, wherein he, too, spoke of
                  'hair-breath 'scapes by flood and field' in the pursuit of thieves on the East
                  River and in their city haunts.</p>
               <p>Fred Fox <emph>could</emph> relate a <emph>real</emph> incident with effect, and
                  the subjects which had come under his observation were as various as the colors in
                  a kaleidescope. This gave him a companionable quality which to me was invaluable,
                  and as he witnessed my intense pleasure while listening to him, he was the more
                  willing to gratify me. By turns he would awaken my keenest sorrow, by a tale of
                  suffering—arouse my indignation by a story of persecution and wrong, and convulse
                  me with laughter by a description of some ludicrous scene. Besides this, he kept
                  me posted up with regard to every singular affair that transpired at his station,
                  and I looked upon him as my second self.</p>
               <p>Things had been rather dull with us, (Fred and myself,) for some time—that is, not
                  exactly dull, for dullness could never exist where Fred was, but then no recent
                  occurrences of interest had transpired—nothing beyond the usual items of brutal
                  assaults and fatal accidents, burglaries, etc. Things had remained in this state
                  for some time I say, when Fred (who often took me with him when he had a case on
                  hand which he thought would interest me,) came rushing into my room in a state of
                  considerable excitement; and before I could question him as to the cause thereof,
                  he exclaimed in a hurried manner, as he laid his hand upon my shoulder—</p>
               <p>'Come, Mr. ——! Come along with me. I've just left a person that you'd like to see,
                  I know. Come along—'taint far!'</p>
               <p>'What is the sex of the person, Fred?' I inquired, 'male or female?'</p>
               <p>'O, it's a woman,' was his reply, 'come!'</p>
               <p>'Have I ever seen her?' I asked.</p>
               <p>'Don't know," he answered, 'guess not—she's a queer customer—looks as if she might
                  a' been top o' the heap at one time, but she's gone under now. She told me she had
                  something on her mind she'd like to make known, but she wouldn't tell it to a
                  policeman—she wouldn't reveal it to anybody but a <emph>gentleman</emph>—that was
                  flattering, wasn't it?'</p>
               <p>'Rather,' I answered, as I arose to accompany him—'but<pb n="16-17"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000009"/> where did you come across this fastidious female,
                  Fred? Who is she? Did you arrest her for theft, or vagrancy, or what?'</p>
               <p>'I didn't arrest her at all,' replied Fred; 'you see, I'll tell you how it was.
                  Last night a countryman was robbed by some woman who picked him up while he was
                  rather oblivious and took him to a crib in Mulberry street. He couldn't remember
                  the house nor even the neighborhood—all he could recollect was that it was in
                  Mulberry street. Now there are a number of places in that locality which are not
                  over respectable, and as the countryman engaged me to look after his property—a
                  watch and some money—I naturally turned my face in that direction. I couldn't find
                  either the thief or the property, but in the last crib I went into—a house with a
                  good many tenants in it—I came across the woman I told you about, in one of the
                  rooms. She was lying on a cot in one corner of the apartment, and at first I
                  thought she was dead—she was so motionless and looked so white—but I soon found
                  out my mistake, for, as I walked towards her, she gave a hollow cough and looked
                  up at me. A miserable, ragged, dirty-looking Irish woman was sitting at her bed
                  dozing, and on my touching her on the shoulder, she looked up and growled out,
                  'What do you want here?' I remembered this woman as soon as I looked at her—I had
                  often noticed her going into the pawn-shop on my beat, and although I always
                  thought she was a bad one, I never caught her at anything criminal. 'What's the
                  matter with that woman?' I enquired, and as I did so, the invalid half raised
                  herself upon one arm, and, in a voice that almost frightened me from its
                  hollowness, answered, before her attendant had a chance to—'What's that to you?
                  What right have you in this room? It's mine—the rent for it is paid in
                  advance—leave it!' and as she finished, she broke into a fit of coughing, which,
                  for a time, I was afraid would prove fatal to her—it was so very violent. I felt
                  sorry for the woman, for, although I didn't like her countenance, she looked to me
                  as though she had been used to better things, so to pacify her, I explained to her
                  that I was in search of a thief, and when I got through, I asked the Irish woman
                  if any doctor had visited the invalid? 'No,' was the reply, 'I wanted her to have
                  one from the Dispinsary, but she wouldn't let me fetch him.' 'No,' broke in the
                  sick woman, faintly, 'I want no doctor—I shall soon be past the want of assistance
                  from anybody, but I'll tell you what I do want—I wish to speak with a gentleman!'
                  'What gentleman?' I enquired. '<emph>Any</emph> gentleman,' was her reply, 'any
                     <emph>real</emph> gentleman by birth and education—I am a <emph>lady,</emph>
                  and I will say what I have to say to none but a gentleman—if you can and will
                  fetch such a person, do it quickly, or you will be too late.' To conclude, I knew
                  the case would suit you exactly,' concluded Fred, 'so I hurried as fast as
                  possible to let you know, and now if you wish we will go at once.'</p>
               <p>I needed no further pressing, and in another moment we were out doors and
                  proceeding at a brisk pace towards our destination. We were not long in reaching
                  Mulberry street, into which we turned, and after walking some blocks further, Fred
                  stopped at the entrance to a long, dingy looking alley, and remarked, in an
                  undertone, 'This is the place—come along!'</p>
               <p>I must own to a somewhat disagreeable feeling as I followed my guide up that
                  dreary looking and horrid-smelling avenue, but I had made up my mind to pursue the
                  adventure to the end, so I proceeded without a remark. The alley terminated in a
                  large court filled with rough-built five story brick houses, not one of which
                  could boast an entire window sash, while the stench arising from the decaying
                  animal and vegetable matter which choked up the filthy cess-pools around was
                  almost overpowering, 'Here is the room we seek,' said Fred, as he drew up at one
                  of these pest-holes, and knocked at the door of an apartment on the first floor.
                  'Come in!' cried a woman's voice, in a gruff tone.</p>
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6405-00000010"/>
               <p>'That's the Irish woman,' whispered Fred, as he opened the door, and we
                  entered.</p>
               <p>If the exterior view of the unsavory place was uninviting, the interior view was
                  still more so. The room was exceedingly dirty and almost destitute of furniture,
                  which consisted only of two rickety old stools, one of them minus a leg, an old
                  pine table, warped, cracked, and disjointed—the miserable cot upon which the sick
                  woman lay, a strip of old rag carpet, and a broken furnace, which stood in the
                  dilapidated fire place. A bundle of straw which served for the bed of the
                  invalid's attendant, was spread in one corner. The floor was thick with dirt, and
                  in three different places rat-holes might be seen, into each of which a piece of
                  brick had been stuck as a protection against the egress of the long-tailed
                  intruders. The whole place had more the appearance of a pig-sty than a
                  dwelling-place for human beings, and a ray of sunlight which struggled through one
                  of the broken window panes, and rested in a small patch upon the dirtiest portion
                  of the floor, seemed through contrast to render the place still more gloomy.</p>
               <p>The Irish woman who had bade us 'Come in,' sat by the bed-side of the sick woman,
                  upon one of the two stools. She looked up as we entered, and as her crazy-looking,
                  blood-shot eyes rested upon Fred, she uttered a subdued 'hush!' and pointing to
                  the bed, she continued, 'The misthress is ashlape—don't wake her!' My mind was so
                  taken up with the invalid that upon entering I had scarcely looked at her
                  attendant, but I now turned my eyes toward her with the intention of scrutinizing
                  her features closely. This privilege was denied me, however, for, as soon as she
                  had spoken, she buried her face in her hands, and remained silent. The sick woman
                  lay asleep, with her face toward the wall, but her slumber was evidently not
                  sound, for occasionally she moved uneasily upon her wretched bed, and ever and
                  anon an exclamation of suffering—half sigh and half groan—escaped her.</p>
               <p>'Here is the gentleman she wished to see,' said Fred, touching the attendant upon
                  the shoulder.</p>
               <p>'Go' way wid yez!' was the impatient reply. 'Can't yez come again? It's not often
                  she shlapes.'</p>
               <p>'Yes, Fred,' said I, in a subdued tone, 'let's come again some other time; perhaps
                  it would be better not to awaken the woman.'</p>
               <p>Scarcely had I spoken, when the invalid awoke, and groaning heavily, turned
                  herself with an effort in the bed. For an instant she lay with her face toward us,
                  but with her eyes still closed. Presently, with a heavy sigh, she slowly opened
                  them, and, with a bewildered stare, they rested full upon me.</p>
               <p>'Kate, what do these people want?' she said, in a hollow tone, addressing the
                  Irish woman, but without withdrawing her gaze from me.</p>
               <p>'You said you wished to see a gentleman,' replied Fred Fox, stepping forward, 'and
                  at your request I have brought this one.'</p>
               <p>'O, yes, I had forgotten,' said the sick woman, languidly; 'I did wish to see a
                  gentleman—but I must be satisfied that he <emph>is</emph> a gentleman—one who has
                  feeling in his heart, and can understand, and appreciate, and not a mere picker-up
                  of stray items—before I can make a confidant of him. What is your name, sir?' she
                  abruptly enquired; 'for there is something in a name—I am satisfied of that.'</p>
               <p>'Harry ——,' I replied, willing to humor her, and at the mention of my name a still
                  deeper crimson was added to the hectic flush which rested upon her cheek; 'and
                  now,' I continued, 'I suppose I may take the same privilege, and ask what your
                  name is?'</p>
               <p>'A knowledge of my name,' she replied, 'can advantage you nothing, but since you
                  wish to know it, I will tell you—Julia Graham.' She paused for a while, as if to
                  gain strength, and I could see, that although she strove hard to conceal it, she
                  was from some cause or other terribly excited. I noticed,<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000011"/> also, that her Irish attendant was fairly aroused,
                  and with head bent forward, was listening eagerly. Presently she jumped from her
                  stool as though she had been shot. For a moment she seemed paralyzed, and then
                  coming close to me she gazed eagerly in my face. Suddenly she cried, in a voice of
                  tremor, as though addressing some one else—</p>
               <p>'It <emph>is</emph> him; and he has a policeman wid him, too. Well, then, me time
                  is come, and if yez want Kate O'Donnell yez must look for her in purgathory!' and
                  dashing by us, she flew out of the door with the speed of a frightened hare.</p>
               <p>It was evident that the parties knew me, although I had no recollection of them;
                  and, in order to aid my memory, I bent over the invalid, and scrutinized her
                  features closely. Suddenly, as I revolved the past over in my mind, retrospection
                  brought up circumstances that had happened long years before, and a light broke in
                  upon me. 'Can it be possible!' I involuntarily exclaimed, as I fancied I
                  recognized in her one whom I had known under far different circumstances.</p>
               <p>'Shall I follow and arrest the Irish woman?' questioned Fred, who seemed perfectly
                  dumfoundered at the turn affairs had taken.</p>
               <p>'No,' said I, 'let her go; her arrest would answer no purpose, and her escape can
                  do no harm; but a conversation with the sick woman is all-important to me.'</p>
               <p>'This is no dream,' said the invalid abstractedly, as she slowly revived, and
                  raised herself, by an effort, in the bed; 'you are real flesh and blood, are you
                  not? Come here, let me touch you!'</p>
               <p>I went close to her, and she laid her hand upon my shoulder—</p>
               <p>'I heard you were dead,' she continued, 'or I never should have come back to this
                  city. However, I'm glad I did come. It was not my wish to see you, but now that we
                  have met I am not sorry for it. Tell me, does that man (pointing to Fred) know
                  anything of my history?'</p>
               <p>I answered in the negative.</p>
               <p>Then,' she continued, 'request him to leave us together. I have much to say to
                  you, and a short time to say it in. I do not wish him to hear it;—not that I am
                  fearful of the law—no, no! I shall soon be in a stronger, darker, and more
                  enduring cell than any in the Centre street Tombs; but I do not wish a third
                  person present. Tell him to go.'</p>
               <p>I took Fred aside, and requested him to leave us.</p>
               <p>'You know her, then?' said he, enquiringly.</p>
               <p>'Yes,' I answered, 'she is an old acquaintance of mine.'</p>
               <p>'Strange,' returned Fred, with a puzzled air; 'I don't remember that you ever
                  spoke to me of any one resembling her.'</p>
               <p>'No,' said I, evasively; 'it is a long story, Fred, and I have learned but half of
                  it myself yet. Some other time I will enlighten you, but at present leave us
                  together.'</p>
               <p>'I don't half like the idea,' was Fred's reply, 'the sick woman can't hurt you, I
                  know, but how about the Irish woman who just left? She's a bad one, if there's
                  anything in appearances—and if you possess any secret which is likely to affect
                  her, she may return with assistance, and work an impediment in your speech.'</p>
               <p>'Don't be at all alarmed about that,' said I, 'you may rest assured she will not
                  make her appearance here again—at least so long as I remain.'</p>
               <p>Thus assured, Fred took one last look at the invalid, and departed, while I drew
                  up a chair close to the bed, and listened to the recital of a story, the details
                  of which even now cause a thrill of horror to creep over me, and is well
                  calculated to prove the verity of the oft quoted axiom that 'Truth is stranger
                  than fiction.'</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>Before entering fairly into the eventful history of Estelle Grant, it may perhaps
                  be proper to state that the writer (who will himself figure occasionally as one of
                  the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">dramatis personæ)</foreign> did not obtain all his
                  facts from the wretched creature, whom, at the close of the last chapter, he left
                  lying upon a sick bed in the Mulberry street hovel. On the contrary, the
                  particulars which furnish the material for the whole story were obtained at
                  considerable trouble and expense from the principal characters introduced, the
                  writer having travelled hundreds of miles for the purpose of procuring an
                  interview with first one and then another of them, after his conversation with the
                  miserable woman, whose candidly spoken, but fearful statements, furnished him with
                  a clue to the whereabouts of many with whom she had come in contact. Having stated
                  thus much in explanation, the writer will now proceed to weave his rough notes,
                  taken at different times, into the woof of a 'plain, unvarnished tale.'</p>
               <p>Some years ago, when the cry of 'Westward Ho!' was in almost everybody's mouth,
                  and the tide of emigration was flowing rapidly in the direction of the principal
                  Western towns, an English family, named Grant, settled in St. Louis, Mo. The head
                  of the family, Edward Grant, was a man about 45 years of age, who, having failed
                  as a cotton manufacturer in Manchester, England, had, with the help of his wife's
                  relatives, collected a considerable sum of money, and determined to try his
                  fortune in the New World. Accordingly, he took passage for New York, where he
                  arrived safely with his wife and two daughters, but after looking about for a few
                  days in search of a fair opening for the investment of his capital, he became
                  dissatisfied with the Empire City, and was finally induced by a person whose
                  acquaintance he had made at the hotel at which he put up, to embark in the
                  mercantile business in St. Louis. This new-made acquaintance, whose name was
                  Everard Emory, gave Mr. Grant to understand that he had an interest in a large
                  establishment in the above town—that the trade was a very lucrative one—and that
                  if he wished, there was an opening for him in the same concern. Emory was a
                  smoothfaced, genteel-looking, fair-spoken young man, and Mr. Grant, after numerous
                  conversations, closed with him, and bearing with him the necessary papers and a
                  letter of introduction to the firm, he soon after reached St. Louis, as above
                  stated, and having located his family in a comfortable residence, a few miles from
                  the city, at once commenced business.</p>
               <p>Although strictly honest, Edward Grant did not possess a very amiable character.
                  He was a proud, selfish, aristocratic man, whose ruling characteristics were
                  stubbornness and self-esteem. Among strangers he was cold arid formal, while
                  towards those connected with him in business, he evinced a haughty demeanor and a
                  dictatorial spirit, which could brook no control. He wished that in all things his
                  word should be law, and was always dissatisfied if such was not the case. In his
                  business relations he was exacting and unreasonable, while at home he was a
                  domestic tyrant. Love had no part in his composition. He would rather enforce
                  obedience by stern looks and harsh words than to draw it forth by loving
                  expressions and kind actions. As is too often the case, fate had willed that his
                  life-companion should be as opposite to himself in disposition as possible, and
                  his wife was a most amiable and sweet-tempered lady. She possessed a kind,
                  affectionate and uncomplaining nature, and though the harsh looks and unjust
                  fault-finding of her husband caused her many a pang, she<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000013"/> bore it patiently, and never allowed a murmur to
                  escape her lips. Continual dropping, however, will wear away a stone, and eighteen
                  years' companionship with a spirit so uncongenial to her own as was that of her
                  husband, had not been without its effect upon her—care and hidden grief had worn
                  her almost to a shadow, even before she left England, but when at length she was
                  forced to abandon home and its endearing associations, the last drop was added to
                  her cup of bitterness, and every day the fact that she was not long to remain an
                  inhabitant of earth grew more and more apparent. Before three months had rolled
                  over her in her western home, she had ceased to exist. She died in giving birth to
                  another daughter.</p>
               <p>It was not till some time after the grave had been closed upon her, that her
                  husband was able fully to realize his loss, and even then he did not give
                  expression to any regret, nor did the event have any softening effect upon his
                  harsh nature. On the contrary, he grew, if possible, more morose, more
                  overbearing, more tyrannical than ever.</p>
               <p>Troubles never come singly, and pecuniary difficulties quickly followed the death
                  of Mr. Grant's estimable wife. He was not a shrewd business man, and the fact soon
                  became apparent that in following the advice of Mr. Emory he had not used proper
                  circumspection. So far from paying him a handsome profit, he found, upon a close
                  examination of his affairs, that he was rapidly going behindhand, and the worst
                  feature of the case was that he could not withdraw his capital. He did not attach
                  any blame to Emory, who had apparently acted from the best motives, and from whom
                  he occasionally received a letter speaking very encouragingly, and urging him to
                  hold on, assuring him (and giving facts and figures to back his assurance) that
                  affairs would speedily take a more favorable turn. The 'favorable turn,' however,
                  did not come, and affairs kept growing worse and worse.</p>
               <p>Fanny and Florence Grant, the two elder daughters of the merchant, were much like
                  their father in disposition. They were rather comely children in appearance, but
                  were both proud and self-willed, and after their mother's death they threw off
                  what little restraint her presence had imposed upon them and made the household as
                  unpleasant as possible. When both were present, Florence, the youngest, was forced
                  to yield to Fanny's authority, but when Fanny was absent, Florence would move
                  around the house in the most dignified manner, and issue her orders to the
                  domestics with the air of an empress. Powerful was the indignation felt in the
                  kitchen when the cook, a fat, jolly-looking mulatto woman, a great favorite of the
                  deceased lady, considered her rights invaded by Fanny Grant, who undertook to give
                  her some instruction concerning culinary matters; and intense was the anger of the
                  house-servant when directed to perform some duty which she had never in her life
                  been known to neglect. They dared not, however, give expression to the angry
                  thoughts which filled them in the presence of their superiors, but when they got
                  together, and there was no one near to hear or see them, the way in which opinions
                  were freely expressed, the whites of eyes rolled up, and significant gestures
                  indulged in, would have astonished the parties whose arbitrary actions called them
                  forth, could they have witnessed them.</p>
               <p>The two sisters would gladly have brought the entire establishment under their
                  rule, could they have done so; but, unfortunately for them, there were two persons
                  whom they were forced to approach with respect. The first was their father, and
                  the next the housekeeper, a dignified, matronly woman, a native of Pennsylvania,
                  who entered the family just previous to the death of Mrs. Grant, and who, after
                  that event, was entrusted with the sole charge of the motherless little one, who
                  had been named Estelle, after her deceased parent.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the loss of her natural protector, little Estelle, under the
                  fostering care of Mrs. Dunscomb, grew finely, and everybody who saw her was forced
                  to admit that a more<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6405-00000014"/> sprightly,
                  bright-faced little creature never drew breath. Such encomiums pleased the
                  good-hearted nurse vastly, for she was proud of her little charge—as proud,
                  indeed, as though she had been her own daughter. But if she loved the little
                  Estelle, her dislike for the two elder girls was in a corresponding degree. As has
                  already been stated, they were forced to treat her with respect—their father
                  exacted this from them, for, though of an unamiable nature himself, he was not so
                  blind but that he could discover the virtues of others. He liked the nurse he had
                  procured for his infant; she was somewhat independent, to be sure, and did not
                  look upon him with that awe which he thought his presence should inspire, still,
                  she studied his wants closely, and, in all but her appreciation of his dignity she
                  suited him exactly, and he did not wish to lose her services. She had told him
                  candidly when she first entered his service she would not be meddled with in the
                  performance of her duties, and he, knowing full well what elicited the remark,
                  summoned his daughters at once, and, in Mrs. Dunscomb's presence charged them
                  strictly not to interfere with her in any particular. This action on the part of
                  their father was of course not calculated to increase the liking of the girls for
                  the housekeeper, and although they dared not openly offend her, they subjected her
                  to a series of petty annoyances day after day which led her in the end cordially
                  to detest them. The fact that Mrs. Dunscomb was so fond of Estelle was another
                  source of annoyance to the girls, who found in it a sufficient reason to dislike
                  the little innocent, and on that account they never played with and seldom looked
                  at her unless it was to make some such remark as, 'homely little thing!'—'it don't
                  look a bit like any of family!'—'it's as cross as it can be!' etc., etc. To such
                  remarks the matron would turn a deaf ear, and only press the child closer to her
                  breast, or if she did venture a reply it would be to the effect that they had
                  nothing to brag of on the score of beauty—that she was glad the baby did not
                  resemble them whoever else it might favor, and that if they did not wish to hear
                  it cry they were not obliged to stay where it was.</p>
               <p>Thus things went on for some eight years, in the course of which time Estelle had
                  grown to be a fine lively child, with large lustrous black eyes, flowing dark
                  ringlets, and a face full of expression. She was of a strange disposition. She
                  seemed to partake somewhat of the character of both her father and mother. In her
                  little heart her mother's affectionate nature seemed to mingle with her father's
                  pride and self-will; and, although the love principle was always active whenever
                  there was anything to draw it forth, still she was keenly alive to insult and
                  injury, and, when excited thereby, showed an intensity of hatred to the object of
                  her wrath that was almost frightful to witness in one so young and usually so mild
                  and yielding. Her nurse viewed this singularity of character with much concern,
                  for she saw in it the evidence of great danger if allowed to run unchecked. To her
                  Estelle never had, even in her most petulant mood, showed other than her angel
                  side. However great her rage, or however deep her grief, it needed but a word from
                  Mrs. Dunscomb, and almost immediately every appearance of anger would vanish, and
                  a bright, sunny smile would shine through the storm of grief. The nurse ruled her
                  by love. She had never in her life spoken a harsh word to her, and yet she held
                  her under the most complete subjection. She was the only mother the child had ever
                  known, and, O, how the little creature loved her! With all the deep devotion of
                  her wild-throbbing tumultuous infant heart, she clung to her as her first and
                  dearest friend, and would scarcely look at or speak to any one else. She did not
                  love her father, for he never played with, or told her stories, or kissed her, as
                  the nurse did. He hadn't time—he was too full of business—so she didn't love him,
                  although she tried hard to do so, for the nurse told her she must love him. She
                  didn't love her sisters either, for they were always teazing her, and sometimes
                  the poor child would wish. she had no sisters, or any other<pb n="28-29"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000015"/> relative or friend except the one who had always
                  been kind to her.</p>
               <p>'Nurse,' said the child, one day, after Mrs. Dunscomb had been lecturing her upon
                  her favorite theme, 'why must I love Pa, and Fanny, and Florence? They don't love
                  me. Pa don't play with me like you do, and Fanny and Florence are always teazing
                  me. I believe they love to see me cry, and I'm sure I don't see why I should love
                  them.'</p>
               <p>'Because,' answered the nurse, mildly, 'God won't love you if you don't love them.
                  You must love them even if they hate you. You must learn to love everybody.'</p>
               <p>'But I <emph>can't</emph> love anybody who hates me. Whenever anybody provokes me,
                  I can't help hating them. I've tried ever so many times, just to please you, but,
                  even when I'm trying the hardest I feel my face burn so, and my heart beats so
                  fast, and I feel as though I should die if I didn't let them see how I hated
                  them.'</p>
               <p>'You will never go to Heaven, where your mamma is, if you feel that way,
                  Estelle—you must pray to have your heart altered, every night, and strive every
                  day, and as you grow bigger you will grow better.'</p>
               <p>For a moment Estelle regarded her kind foster-mother with a sorrowful expression
                  of countenance, and at length she sank at her feet and burying her tiny face in
                  the good woman's lap she wept bitterly.</p>
               <p>'Don't cry, love,' said the nurse, as she soothingly passed her fingers through
                  the child's glossy curls—'don't cry—what ails my darling?' and gently raising the
                  little sorrowing face to her own, she imprinted a warm, motherly kiss upon the
                  soft, peach-like cheek.</p>
               <p>'O, nurse,' sobbed Estelle, 'I am afraid I can never be a good girl—but I will
                  try—indeed, indeed I will. It is no trouble for me to be good when I am with yon,
                  for I love you very, very much, and you love me, I know,'—then suddenly checking
                  her grief, and wiping the tears from her beautiful face, she continued, 'I wish
                  you, James Ely, and I, could go to sea in a big ship, like Robinson Crusoe did,
                  and be cast away on some island where there would be nobody but us three—then I
                  could be good, and go to Heaven when I died, for I should have nobody to make me
                  bad.'</p>
               <p>'Who is James Ely, darling?? questioned the nurse.</p>
               <p>'Why, nurse,' said the little creature, now all smiles, and holding up her hands
                  in astonishment, 'have you forgotten already? Don't you remember I told you about
                  the little boy who lives next door, who goes to our school, and who always takes
                  my part when the children attempt to plague me? I did't think you'd forget
                     <emph>him!'</emph>
               </p>
               <p>'O, yes, I recollect now, dear,' replied the nurse, smiling, 'but you never told
                  me what his name was before, and so I did not know to whom you alluded.'</p>
               <p>'O, he is such a good boy!' said Estelle, delightedly—'he does everything he can
                  to please me, and yet Florence says I shan't play with him, because his father is
                  a poor man. This morning he made me such a beautiful bouquet, and threw it over
                  the fence to me, and just as I was about to pick it up and thank him for it,
                  Florence snatched it out of my hand and threw it back again, and called him a
                  little beggar, and told him to keep his flowers to himself!' and when she had got
                  thus far, Estelle paused, for she found the wicked spirit gaining the mastery over
                  her again. A large tear shone in each eye, her face was suffused with indignation,
                  and her little bosom throbbed tumultuously.</p>
               <p>'And what did you say to Florence, love? questioned her foster-mother.</p>
               <p>'I said and did what I know you will say was wicked,' replied the child; 'I told
                  her that she was a beggar herself, and that I hated her, and when I said all I
                  could I seized hold of the skirt of her dress, and tried with all my might to tear
                  it off.'</p>
               <p>'That was very, very naughty,' said the nurse, reprovingly, 'and you must never do
                  so again.'</p>
               <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6405-00000016"/>
               <p>But,' questioned the child, 'is it wicked to be poor, nurse?'</p>
               <p>'No, my child,' was the answer, 'some people can't help being poor—I am poor, but
                  it is not my fault.'</p>
               <p>'Then why should Florence call James a beggar?' said Es-telle, 'he don't go round
                  with ragged clothes and a dirty face, and a basket on his arm—he is no more a
                  beggar than I am.'</p>
               <p>'Florence was very wrong,' replied the nurse, 'but that was no reason why you
                  should give way to your passion—hereafter, love, when anything of the kind happens
                  you must come to me, and I will tell you what to do.'</p>
               <p>'I will try to,' replied the child, and the nurse, after preparing her for school,
                  dismissed her with a kiss, and she was shortly afterwards seen hand in hand with
                  James Ely walking through the lane which led to the little school-house.</p>

               <p>EVERARD EMORY was a man who was always awake for the prosecution of a 'fair
                  business transaction.' If he could get the advantage of a brother-merchant or a
                  retail dealer from the country, no matter by what species of meanness or chicanery
                  he succeeded in obtaining that end, it was with him 'a fair business transaction.'
                  Taking advantage of the necessities of his fellow-men, under any and all
                  circumstances, he considered nothing less than a 'fair business transaction.'
                  Foreclosing a bond and mortgage when he had solemnly promised he would give his
                  creditor time to take it up, was a 'fair business transaction'—letting out houses
                  splendidly furnished at an exorbitant rent to ladies of easy virtue, was a 'fair
                  business transaction'—turning a family into the street for nonpayment of rent,
                  even though the father of that family might be lying on a sick bed or the mother
                  in the pangs of maternity, was a 'fair business transaction'—in short anything by
                  which he might add to his enormous wealth, so long as it did not bring him within
                  the grasp of the law, was a fair business transaction.</p>
               <p>As an illustration of Mr. Emory's method of doing business sometimes, let us look
                  into one of the tumble-down tenements in Cannon street, of which he is the owner.
                  The house, which is of brick, and three stories high, is a very old one, and when
                  built was intended for one family, but now there are six families in it. A group
                  of ragged, dirty-faced children of both sexes are upon the door-steps, and
                  although most of them are sickly-looking and emaciated, the effect of exposure and
                  want, yet do they possess some degree of activity and are full of noisy mirth.
                  Hardship and hunger have not entirely succeeded in 'crushing out' all the
                  exuberant spirit, the buoyant feeling, which belongs to glorious childhood, and
                  though some of them are sad and drooping, most of them look careless, if not
                  contented. Let us proceed up the ricketty staircase, and opening the first door
                  that comes to hand, let us enter, and we are in the home of Thos. Gardner, a
                  shoemaker. The room is very small and almost destitute of furniture, but what few
                  pieces there are, are disposed about the room to the best advantage. There is but
                  one strip of carpet, but the floor is white and clean, as are also the windows and
                  the walls, although some few panes of glass are out, and are replaced by stiff
                  paper neatly pasted in. A sick man is stretched upon the only bed in the room,
                  while a woman sits up near him, busily plying her needle upon a pair of
                  shoe-uppers. An infant six months old, whose pale, little face, gives it almost a
                  ghost-like appearance, is lying asleep on a worn-out quilt upon the floor, and is
                  watched over by a little girl some five years of age. The sick man is very much
                  wasted by disease and does not look as though he would long be a burthen upon his
                  wife, who nods even while sews, and is fit to drop from weakness, the result of<pb
                     n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6405-00000017"/> hunger and over-watching. It was from no
                  fault of Thomas Gardner that his family is thus destitute. He was a sober,
                  industrious man, and before misfortune fell upon him with a heavy hand he had
                  managed to get along comfortably enough. But the fire-fiend came and wrested from
                  him what little property he possessed. The house in which he lived was burned to
                  the ground, and he and his wife and little ones barely escaped with their lives.
                  After that he hired the wretched apartments in which he then lived, but he fell
                  sick from a cold which he contracted at the time of the fire, and when he had
                  worked till he fell from his bench in a state of exhaustion, his wife prevailed
                  upon him to go to bed, where he had lain ever since, attended to and supported by
                  her uncomplainingly.</p>
               <p>'Rachel, dear,' murmurs the sick man, turning his languid eyes upon his wife, 'do
                  go to sleep for a little while—it worries me to see you strive so hard to keep
                  awake—you are killing yourself.'</p>
               <p>'Hush, dear,' is the gentle reproof, as the wife lays her-long, slender fingers
                  upon her bloodless lip, 'the doctor says you must keep quiet. Kitty O'Donnell, who
                  lives in the next room, promised me she would come in presently to watch by you,
                  and then I'll sleep.'</p>
               <p>A silence of five minutes, broken only by the sighs of the heart-seared wife and
                  the hard-fetched breath of the sick man ensues, when the latter again speaks,
                  though seemingly more to himself than to his wife—</p>
               <p>'Mr. Emory has been told what a state I'm in, and I don't think he would be so
                  cruel as to turn us into the street. But if he should—God help us—<emph>if he
                     should!'</emph>
               </p>
               <p>'Don't, Thomas, pray don't talk so,' urges the wife, in a low tone, 'you don't
                  know how it troubles me.'</p>
               <p>'Well, I won't, dear,' is the response, and silence again ensues.</p>
               <p>And now the wife's chin drops upon her breast, and though she is evidently asleep,
                  her fingers move mechanically to and fro. The husband is not asleep. He lies with
                  his large glassy eyes wide open, and looks first at his wife, and then at the
                  sleeping babe and its guardian sister. The latter sees his gaze fixed upon her,
                  and God bless the child, she murmurs softly as though fearful of waking her
                  mother—</p>
               <p>'Go to sleep, Papa, I ain't hungry a bit—I can go a good while longer without
                  eating yet.'</p>
               <p>A stifled groan bursts from the lips of the agonized invalid, and then the door
                  opens abruptly, and a gruff, surly-looking man blocks its entrance.</p>
               <p>'Now, then,' he cries, and at the first sound of his voice the sleeping wife
                  bounds from her chair as though the knell of death had been rung in her ear, 'is
                  that money ready?'</p>
               <p>Not yet—not quite yet, Mr. Cantwell,' cries Rachael Gardener, in a despairing
                  tone. 'I only asked for a week—only one week—surely Mr. Emory will grant me
                  that.'</p>
               <p>'Surely Mr. Emory will do no such thing,' is the harsh reply—'it ain't the way he
                  does business—he's waited three days already, and now if the money ain't ready you
                  must bundle out—that's my orders, and there's no use talking about it, for I can't
                  help it.'</p>
               <p>The sick man raises himself by a great effort upon one elbow, and his lips move as
                  if in the attempt to speak. The attempt is vain—a few unintelligible mutterings
                  escape his mouth—the glare of dissolution is in his eyes, the death-rattle sounds
                  in his throat and he falls back upon his pillow a corpse.</p>
               <p>'He's dead!' shrieks the now-frantic woman as she throws herself upon the body,
                  'he's dead, and you have killed him! May the widow's curse pursue his
                  murderers!'</p>
               <p>Do you start, reader, and look incredulous? Nay, this is but one case. Wives are
                  made widows and children left fatherless and homeless in this great city, almost
                  every day, by some 'fair business transaction.'</p>
               <p>And notwithstanding all this, Everard Emory was pronounced immaculate by 'mouths
                  of wisest censure.' He was a professed<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6405-00000018"/>
                  follower of the meek and lowly One—no one prayed louder in prayer-meeting, and no
                  one contributed more largely to the support of the gospel than he did—no one was
                  more polished in his manners, more grave and solemn in his deportment, more
                  affable and soft spoken in his intercourse with those <emph>who did not know
                     him,</emph> but who thought they knew him best. In the world of fashion—not
                  extreme fashion, but respectable, serious, religious fashion—Everard Emory was a
                  Christian, for there he was not known, but in the world of poverty, and toil and
                  suffering, he was a devil, for there he was known.</p>
               <p>After stating so much concerning this pattern man, the reader will not be
                  surprised to learn that when Everard Emory found out that Mr. Grant had a
                  considerable sum of money, and that he wished to invest the same in some
                  profitable business, he (Emory) should feel anxious to put him in the way to do
                  so, by roping him into a 'fair business transaction.' Thus it was, then: Everard
                  Emory owned a share in a St. Louis mercantile concern which he had started in
                  company with two others, and which, contrary to his expectations, turned out
                  anything but profitable. Consequently, he was anxious to sell out to advantage,
                  and he found a good customer in Mr. Grant. His partners in business were to some
                  extent in his power. He was in the possession of certain facts concerning them
                  which they would not like to have had made public. In fact, this was a favorite
                  game of Emory's. He was a shrewd calculator, and seldom had business relations
                  with a man unless he gained a hold upon him in some way, before they parted. Not
                  unfrequently he would actually persuade a man into a dishonest course of action,
                  but in such cases he always operated so shrewdly that not the slightest proof
                  against himself could be adduced.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Grant, therefore, broached the subject of business to him, he first
                  satisfied himself that his customer was sound, and then he at once offered him a
                  share in the concern in which he was a partner, <emph>on the most advantageous
                     terms.</emph> As he represented it, the house was in a most flourishing
                  condition, and could not fail to make a speedy fortune for all concerned in it,
                  and by a string of other equally great falsehoods he succeeded in selling
                     <emph>his share</emph> in the concern to the dupe, thus effecting a decidedly
                  fair business transaction, after which he instantly wrote to St. Louis, advising
                  his partners of the course he had taken, and hinting significantly in a postscript
                  that it was not necessary Mr. Grant should know that Everard Emory no longer
                  constituted one of the firm. Mr. Grant was consequently entirely ignorant of the
                  game which had been played upon him, and as year after year passed by, and things
                  instead of mending grew daily worse, he, of course, thought that Emory was an
                  equal sufferer with himself, and if he did blame him at all, it was for what he
                  considered his lack of judgment in engaging in so doubtful a speculation, and not
                  because he had the slightest doubt of his honesty.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>A PERIOD of sixteen years had passed away after Mr. Grant first located himself in
                  St. Louis, and though care had graven deep channels in his face, and the hand of
                  time had slightly bent his back and silvered his hair, he was the same proud,
                  arrogant, unyielding man as ever. Often did his necessities push him to the
                  greatest extremes, still he managed to keep up appearances, and the struggles
                  which he was frequently forced to undergo were hidden even from his children.
                  Among other creditors, he had drawn largely upon Emory, who, of course, professed
                  the greatest friendship for him, and never refused a loan <emph>when he could
                     accomodate him</emph>—but occasionally even he was short (at least he said so,
                  and who would presume<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6405-00000019"/> to doubt the word
                  of so estimable a man,) and then Mr. Grant was forced to apply elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Estelle had grown to be a charming girl, but her foster-mother, with all her
                  careful training, had not succeeded entirely in eradicating those traits of
                  character which had so plainly marked her infancy. She was yet quick-tempered and
                  sometimes wilful where she was not held by affection, but to the old nurse she was
                  still the same dutiful and tractable child as ever. Her little playmate, James
                  Ely, had changed from the school boy into a fine, noble-looking youth of nineteen,
                  and was as much like Estelle in disposition as possible—fiery and impetuous under
                  wrong—stubborn under coercion, but warmhearted and easily won over by gentle
                  persuasion and words of affection. They had changed towards each other in nothing,
                  with the exception that love had taken the place of friendship, and, although
                  James was not allowed to visit the house, and Mr. Grant had in the sternest terms,
                  forbidden Estelle, on pain of his displeasure, to see or speak to him, yet they
                  met often, despite the vigilance of the household, and exchanged sentiments of
                  undying affection and enduring constancy. James, like Estelle, was motherless, his
                  maternal parent having died when he was about two years of age. His father had
                  been a captain in the merchant's service, but a severe chronic rheumatism attacked
                  him shortly after the death of his wife, which incapacitated him from following
                  his vocation, and he was obliged to take up his residence permanently on shore.
                  Like most persons engaged in such service, Capt. Ely was a rather improvident man,
                  and consequently could not boast of his possessions, although he had saved
                  sufficient money, if properly expended, to give his son a fair education, and to
                  provide for his own wants during the few years, which, in the regular course of
                  nature, were left to him.</p>
               <p>Neither Fanny nor Florence Grant were troubled with many suitors after Estelle
                  began to show signs of womanhood. The fact is, that although considered rich,
                  their society had never been much courted by the more fastidious fashionable
                  flatterers of the male sex, even when they were young and most attractive. This
                  may be accounted for partly from the fact that they were so full of self-love and
                  vanity that they never saw a man whom they considered an equal, and partly from
                  the fact that they were naturally cold and distant, and took no pains to conceal
                  their disagreeable qualities.</p>
               <p>At first, this conduct on the part of his daughters gave Mr. Grant no concern, for
                  his unsociable nature rather revolted at than desired new ties of relationship,
                  and he imagined that he should always be beyond the reach of want; but as old age
                  began to creep over him, and he saw nothing but bankruptcy in the future, he
                  regretted that he had not earlier counselled them to act a different part. Fanny
                  had now reached the age of thirty, and, though still youthful-looking, she was
                  extremely cross-grained and uncompanionable—almost cynical, in fact. Of her, Mr.
                  Grant had no hope. Florence was only two years younger than Fanny, and, although
                  partaking largely of the latter's disposition, she was more artful, and when her
                  father, after many struggles with his pride, laid before her the whole state of
                  his affairs, and set forth in strong terms the probability of poverty in the
                  future, her vanity took the alarm, and she determined, late as it was for her to
                  think about it, to secure a husband if possible.</p>
               <p>Estelle was scarcely more than a child as yet, and the idea of her marrying never
                  entered her father's head—still, he could not helping noticing that the young
                  gentlemen visitors at his house paid her many marked attentions, and this fact
                  induced the reflection that although she was not a woman yet, she would soon be
                  one. This reflection was followed by the recollection of the decided preference
                  which Estelle had shown for the youth, James Fly, now clerk in a mercantile
                  establishment at a salary of about six hundred a year. He well knew his child's
                  obstinate, wilful disposition—he was satisfied that was neither to be awed by
                  threats or controlled by force,<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6405-00000020"/> even when
                  exercised by himself, and this troubled him exceedingly. He was not fearful of any
                  immediate step on the part of the young people—in fact, he was half-inclined to
                  believe that his child's preference was a mere girlish fancy which would in time
                  die out of itself—but then she was a singularly imaginative child, and
                     <emph>might</emph> cling to her early recollections—she <emph>might</emph>
                  resolve upon keeping up her acquaintance with the penniless clerk—she
                     <emph>might</emph> at some future day even marry him in spite of everything.
                  Mr. Grant was not actually fearful of this result, but as I have said, he thought
                  that such a thing <emph>might</emph> be, and the remotest possibility of such a
                  contingency was frightful to him. He would rather, much rather have seen her a
                  corpse before him than the wife of James Ely. On this account he charged his two
                  elder daughters to watch her closely; and knowing that Mrs. Dunscomb possessed
                  unbounded influence over her, he begged that lady to argue his child out of what
                  he termed "her wicked, babyish whim."</p>
               <p>Among the few single gentlemen who visited at Mr. Grant's residence was a Mr.
                  Cornelius Hollowell. He had gained the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">entree</foreign> to
                  the house on a letter of recommendation from Mr. Emory, who represented him as
                  being a gentleman speculator of some wealth, who was called in the direction of
                  St. Louis on business which it would take him some time to complete. This was
                  partly true and partly false—though to do Emory justice, he believed it to be all
                  true. The fact is, Mr. Hollowell was about as sharp a man as Mr. Emory himself,
                  and he had succeeded, by some means, in making the latter individual believe he
                  was quite wealthy, when his riches at most were confined to a few hundreds. He was
                  as Emory had represented him to be, a speculator, but not one of that class who
                  confine their attentions solely to real-estate and railroad and steamboat stocks.
                  His speculations embraced a wide range, comprising everything that was likely to
                  prove at all profitable, whether stocks, real estate, faro-banks, tailor's bills,
                  moustache growing or matrimony. He was an adventurer, and no sooner had he entered
                  Mr. Grant's abode, than he commenced a series of <emph>speculations</emph> as to
                  whether "the old boy" had what he facetiously termed "the collateral," and if so,
                  whether the same would prove comeatable through Florence. It was hard to satisfy
                  himself concerning the first of these <emph>speculations,</emph> for Emory had
                  furnished him with no information concerning the state of Mr. Grant's affairs by
                  which he might be guided, and he found upon enquiry that everybody else was as
                  ignorant on the subject as he was himself. From the fact, however, that the young
                  lady treated him with extreme <foreign xml:lang="FRA">hauteur,</foreign>
                  notwithstanding his reputation for wealth and his brilliant appearance (for he did
                  make a brilliant appearance, as the world goes) he naturally arrived at the
                  conclusion, after much reflection, that where there was such an abundance of pride
                  and independence there must be considerable money, which latter commodity he
                  determined to secure, if flattery, impudence and knavery could accomplish that
                  result.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, he was not less surprised than gratified when, after a long course of
                  the most apathetic indifference, assuming occasionally the shape of actual
                  repulses, on the part of Florence, she began to treat him more kindly, and to even
                  manifest pleasure in his society. Fanny, too, grew less distant, and the old
                  gentleman treated him with all the cordiality which such a nature as his could
                  assume. Hollowell hugged the darling assurance to his heart that he had at last
                  made an impression—that the at first inappreciative girl had at length recognized
                  his "fine points"—and he was happy.</p>
               <p>While this interesting matrimonial game was in progress, Estelle and young Ely
                  were not idle in playing their parts as real lovers; but their pleasing drama was
                  suddenly stopped for a season, by the appearance, in one of the favorite scenes,
                  of an unwelcome character. Fanny Grant had suddenly surprised them in one of their
                  stolen interviews, and, of course, lost no time in making her father acquainted
                  with the fact. A domestic storm, in which Estelle, imperious, bold and
                     resolute,<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6405-00000021"/> battled with the elements,
                  was the consequence. The old man fairly trembled with excitement, and swore, in
                  his great rage, that he would shoot her lover and her both if they persisted in
                  running counter to his will. Fanny thought that, if she did not care for her
                  family, she should have more respect for herself then to forfeit her standing in
                  society by seeking the companionship of such a clown; Florence could not imagine
                  what she saw to admire in the low-bred fellow; and Mr. Hollowell (who was now an
                  acknowledged suitor, and thought he was justified in venturing a remark) said the
                  fellow deserved a horse-whipping for presuming to force himself into decent
                  society.</p>
               <p>At this remark, from a person whom Estelle regarded as a stranger, and whom she
                  had never liked from his first appearance in the house, the young girl's large
                  black eyes flashed with indignation, and her face was crimson with resentment as
                  she replied, in a quiet but earnest manner—</p>
               <p>'Doubtless, you are sincere, sir, in what you say, and, as a good member of
                  society, I consider it your duty to inflict the chastisement which, in your
                  opinion, should be meted out. You will have no difficulty in finding the
                     <emph>fellow,</emph> who, <emph>perhaps,</emph> will take his punishment
                  kindly; but if he should not, and you should chance to be the whipped instead of
                  the whipper, you may console yourself with the reflection that you at least
                     <emph>attempted</emph> to do your duty. Pray, do try it, sir!'</p>
               <p>And, unable longer to restrain her tears, she rushed from the room, and,
                  proceeding to her foster-mother's apartment, threw herself upon the old lady's
                  neck, and gave way to a passionate outburst of mingled rage and grief.</p>
               <p>'Never mind, darling,' said Mrs. Dunscomb, soothingly, after Estelle had, in
                  sentences broken by sobs, related what had transpired. 'Hope for the best—it will
                  all come right at last. You did wrong, to be sure, to meet the young man, after
                  your father had commanded you to relinquish his company, but they needn't have
                  rated you so severely. Hereafter, my child, you must try to forget James Ely,
                  since your father is so bitterly set against him, for your duty to your parent
                  should be paramount to every other feeling.'</p>
               <p>'Nurse,' determinedly replied Estelle, who had now become quite calm, 'I have
                  obeyed my father in everything but this, not because I loved or feared him, but
                  because you taught me that it was my duty to do so, but do not be displeased with
                  me if I declare that as far as James Ely is concerned I shall never even try to
                  forget him. What has he ever done that he should be stigmatized as low-bred or
                  clownish? Is he not gentlemanly, honest and respectably connected? Can one bring a
                  single charge against him save that he is poor, and that he has dared to love me,
                  his equal in poverty, if what my father says be true? I tell you, nurse,' she
                  continued, resolutely, and in a loud tone, 'that in this determination, be it
                  right or wrong, I will remain steadfast, even though death itself should be the
                  consequence of my obstinacy, for that is what you will doubtless term it.'</p>
               <p>At this moment her father (who had followed her after she left the room, and who
                  had heard all that passed between her and her foster-mother) entered the
                  apartment.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <p>MR. GRANT'S face was livid with rage—his thin lips twitched nervously, and his
                  passionate, snake-like eyes sparkled with fury as he turned them upon his
                  self-willed daughter.</p>
               <p>'So, so,' he exclaimed, ironically, 'you have obeyed me only because your nurse
                  has taught you that it was your duty to do so, eh? And you are determined now to
                  set at naught even her teachings? Since such is the case, I am inclined to think
                  that your nurse's method of impressing her lessons has lacked force, and it is
                  necessary that I should take the matter in hand myself. A little wholesome
                  restraint, if I may be allowed an opinion, is necessary to bring you to your
                  senses, and henceforth you are to be under the especial charge of your sister
                  Fanny, who shall never, even for a moment, lose sight of you; and should this fail
                  to bring you under proper subjection, I will try the efficacy of bolts and bars.
                  Mrs. Dunscomb,' he continued, turning to that old lady, who, with a troubled
                  expression of countenance, stood silently gazing on the scene, 'you will oblige me
                  if you will keep aloof from my daughter till further orders.'</p>
               <p>The good old woman's eyes filled with tears, at this abrupt termination of the
                  stern old man's speech, for the idea of being separated from her pet had never
                  entered her mind. For sixteen long, long years Estelle had never been absent from
                  her even for a day. With a solicitude equal to that of an own mother, she had
                  watched over her in infancy, taught her to lisp the first words her little
                  'stammering tongue' had ever uttered, guided her tiny, tottering feet in the first
                  essay at stepping, watched her growth from day to day, soothed her childish
                  troubles, quieted her fears, and made her character a study till she was
                  acquainted with all the phases of her singular disposition. Nor could Estelle bear
                  the thought of being transferred from the care of her foster-mother to that of her
                  tyrannical sister. It was a contingency she had never thought of, and it came upon
                  her with startling effect. Of all threats that could have been made this was to
                  her the most fearful—of all punishment that could be inflicted the most dreadful—a
                  fact of which her father was well aware, and he acted upon it.</p>
               <p>'Let me beg of you, sir,' said Mrs. Dunscomb, with much emotion, 'to reconsider
                  the determination at which you have just arrived. Estelle is quick-tempered and
                  thoughtless in speech, and did not mean all she said. She will obey you in future,
                  if you leave her with me—I <emph>know</emph> she will,' and as she ceased she
                  turned an imploring look, full of meaning, upon her wilful pet.</p>
               <p>Estelle interpreted the look at once. She knew her kind old nurse desired that she
                  should retract what she had said, and promise to be a more obedient child in
                  future, and she wished to do so on more accounts than one. In the few short
                  moments intervening between her parent's expressed determination and her nurse's
                  appeal to her, she had turned over in her mind all the disagreeable treatment to
                  which she would be subjected if her father's threat was carried out—the sarcasm
                  and tyranny of her sour-tempered custodian—the taunting remarks of Florence, and
                  the insulting observations of Hollowell. From these painful speculations her mind
                  reverted to the agony of mind which her old nurse, whom she loved dearly, would
                  suffer in her absence. She knew the old lady would pine and weep for her lost pet.
                  She saw the tears coursing down the furrowed cheeks, even while her appalling gaze
                  was fixed upon her. Then again her thoughts turned upon herself. To whom should
                  she fly in her<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6405-00000023"/> time of trouble and
                  unrest? Into whose ear could she pour her complaint? Upon whose bosom could she
                  weep away her sorrows, if taken from her darling foster-mother? It was a severe
                  struggle between fear for herself and defiance of her father—love for her nurse
                  and determined self-will. The latter, however, proved to be the master-passion,
                  for she at length said, in a proud and defiant tone, looking the while steadily at
                  her father, who was apparently waiting for her decision—</p>
               <p>'In all things proper, my father has the right to command me, and I will obey him,
                  but I deny him authority over my affections, which are God-given, and which I
                  could not, if I would, alter. He may by force control my actions, but he cannot
                  prevent my natural aspirations, and I should be acting the part of a hypocrite
                  should I promise that which I know it would be impossible for me to perform.'</p>
               <p>'It is about such a reply as I anticipated,' said Mr. Grant with forced calmness,
                  'and I don't know that I should have altered my course of action had it been more
                  humble. All that remains for me to do now, is to place you at once under the care
                  of your future guardian and preceptress, to whom I shall give my instructions
                  concerning you in your presence.'</p>
               <p>And taking her unresisting hand, he led her to the room of his eldest
                  daughter.</p>
               <p>For a week was Estelle a prisoner in her father's house—nay, worse than that. She
                  would gladly have exchanged places with one confined in a penal institution, for
                  then she might have been left to herself, but as it was, her keeper was always
                  with her. True, she was allowed the range of the house and garden, but never
                  alone—close by her side was ever to be found her dictatorial and splenetic sister,
                  and not unfrequently both her sisters—who, with a refinement of cruelty, of which
                  few of the softer sex happily are capable, played upon her high-toned nature to
                  such a degree as to render her occasionally almost demoniacal. To add to her
                  grief, she frequently met her foster-mother around the house, but was not allowed
                  the privilege of speaking to her. At such times it took all the nerve the poor
                  child possessed to prevent her from weeping bitterly, but she would not have
                  gratified her sisters by shedding a tear for the wide world. She often felt,
                  however, as though she would be willing to die for the privilege of throwing
                  herself once more upon that old lady's bosom, and weeping till she had not one
                  more tear left to shed.</p>
               <p>This systematic cruelty could of course have no other effect than that of
                  developing in a ten-fold degree all Estelle's most objectionable qualities. It
                  rendered her more self-willed and obdurate than ever, and led her to cordially
                  hate and despise those for whom she should have cherished the most kindly
                  feelings.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dunscomb knew that this would be the effect of such arbitrary and unjust
                  measures, and she lost no opportunity of setting forth the fact in strong terms to
                  Mr. Grant, with whom she argued that the part he was playing was no less unjust
                  towards her than it was dangerous to both the health and disposition of his
                  daughter—that even admitting he was right in taking such measures to punish
                  Estelle, he had no right to punish her, (Mrs. D.) who had always most faithfully
                  looked after his household and anticipated his wishes. She represented to him that
                  so far from softening and making more pliant the obstinate nature of his child, he
                  was only rendering her angular temper more uneven, and awakening in her bosom
                  passions which no after-repentance on his part could eradicate, and which would
                  tend to utterly ruin her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grant saw the force of this argument, but it would nevertheless have been
                  unavailing to move his stern heart, had it not been backed by some suggestions on
                  the part of Fanny, who was beginning to grow tired of her charge, (pleasant as it
                  was at first to command Estelle and spite Mrs. Dunscombe at the same time,) and
                  wished to accomplish by stratagem what she knew could never be effected by
                  coercion. She therefore argued with her father that it was his duty as a parent
                     to<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6405-00000024"/> alienate Estelle's affections from
                  James Ely, by any means within his power. She candidly admitted that she did not
                  believe force would ever effect anything. 'We might,' she said, 'continue to keep
                  them apart; but this requires a constant vigilance which is too troublesome,
                  especially when, by a little stratagem, we may place an effectual barrier between
                  them. The child is neither to be driven or coaxed by us—her heart is full of
                  pent-up wrath which we may smother, but which we cannot prevent from breaking
                  forth with uncontrollable fury the moment an opportunity offers. Besides, we
                  cannot always guard her, and I am satisfied that if a chance for escape should at
                  any time occur, she would, without any hesitation, fly to her lover, and once in
                  the presence of a minister, all the trouble we have taken with her would be lost.
                  A little deception in such a case would, I think, be perfectly justifiable.'</p>
               <p>'And what do you propose to do?' asked her father, whose worst fears were awakened
                  by the probability of the elopement and marriage hinted at by the wily Fanny.</p>
               <p>'In the first place,' was the reply, 'pretend that you have witnessed satisfactory
                  signs of amendment in Estelle, and permit her once more to receive the caresses
                  and attentions of Mrs. Dunscomb. Change your manner towards her by degrees, and
                  after a few days, admit to the nurse that you have misjudged your child's
                  character, and taken the wrong means to exact obedience from her—that you are
                  still opposed to the match, but feeling confident that Estelle's happiness is at
                  stake, you are willing to permit the visits of James Ely to the house, and if,
                  after a proper time has expired, she still holds to her preference, you will place
                  no obstacle in the way of their union. This will throw both her and her baby lover
                  entirely off their guard, and give us a chance to operate.'</p>
               <p>'But what is next to be done?' questioned the old man, upon whose countenance
                  there rested a mingled expression of disgust, fear and impatience.</p>
               <p>'Why, then,' answered Fanny,' we must awaken jealousy—not only in her but in
                  him—they are both quick-tempered and easily worked upon—once arouse that passion
                  within them and mutual hate will take the place of that silly passion which they
                  suppose to be love.'</p>
               <p>'I do not at all like the part which you are disposed to assign me in this
                  disagreeable drama,' remarked the old man, 'and moreover I am afraid I should play
                  it but indifferently, for it is not at all in my line.'</p>
               <p>'Better to rehearse this part well, than to be obliged hereafter to play the
                  principal character in a real life drama which for want of a better name we may
                  entitle Poor Relations,' replied Fanny.</p>
               <p>This last master-stroke of Fanny's, settled the matter, and the proud old man who
                  had never before dreamed of employing either persuasion or trickery to enforce
                  compliance with his commands, promised to go by her direction.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, after the unsuspecting Estelle had passed, as I have before remarked,
                  a week of most intolerable suffering under the dominion of her sister, she
                  suddenly found herself free from bondage, and once more enjoying the society of
                  her foster-mother. This was a great blessing to her, but it was nothing in
                  comparison with the joy she felt when informed by the old lady that her father had
                  relented, and had expressed his willingness that James Ely should visit the house.
                  How gratifying, not only to her love, but to her wounded pride, was the
                  intelligence! What a triumph over her tantalizing sisters, and her insulting
                  brother-in-law in prospective! How proud of James she would show herself in their
                  presence, just for the satisfaction which such a display would give her! How
                  loftily she would carry her head while resting upon his arm, as though she were a
                  queen, her lover a prince, and all the household besides (excepting of course her
                  nurse and father) her subjects! Poor girl! how little did she dream of the
                  duplicity that was being practiced upon her—a duplicity<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000025"/> in which even her father had a share! Yet how happy
                  she was in her blissful ignorance! Happy as only a fresh young heart, full of
                  love, and hope, and happy anticipations, can be. She could only account for the
                  sudden change in her father's demeanor towards her in one way. She attributed it
                  to the influence and motherly eloquence of her old nurse, and she determined if it
                  was ever in her power, she would show the kind old lady how full she was of
                  gratitude. To say the truth, Mrs. Dunscomb (who was of course as ignorant of the
                  true state of affairs as Estelle herself) was inclined also to think that her
                  frequent conversations with Mr. Grant had not been without their effect upon
                  him.</p>
               <p>To say that James Ely was equally surprised and overjoyed when he received a note
                  from Estelle informing him that every obstacle to their free companionship had
                  been removed, would but poorly express that youth's feelings. He could scarcely at
                  first divest himself of the idea that he was dreaming, and after he had read the
                  note over and over again a dozen times, he took it to his father (his confidant in
                  everything) in order to fully satisfy himself that he was wide awake.</p>
               <p>'See, father,' he said, rushing into the old gentleman's presence, with the
                  precious billet open in his hand; 'see what Estelle has written! read—read!' and
                  as he spoke his large, lustrous black eyes sparkled with joy, and his fine, manly
                  countenance was full of pleasurable excitement.</p>
               <p>The old captain was seated in his easy chair when the youth entered, and with his
                  feet resting upon an ottoman, was dreamily indulging in pleasant thoughts of the
                  past. The life of a sea-faring man is necessarily an eventful one, and Capt. Ely
                  had doubtless, in his long connection with maritime affairs, endured many
                  hardships, witnessed many scenes which he would fain have forgotten, and perhaps
                  have committed some faults for which he was heartily sorry, but a review of his
                  long and useful life left him very little to regret, and much to render him happy
                  and contented. He was decidedly intellectual, and when young was an active,
                  spirited, and fearless man, though prodigally generous, and full of the 'milk of
                  human kindness.' He was a thorough seaman on ship-board, and a gentleman in the
                  drawing-room. He was not the sea-captain too often pictured in novels and
                  represented upon the stage—that disgusting caricature, whose meaningless froth and
                  fury is intended for honest indignation—whose obscene remarks and ribald oaths
                  take the place of true humor and plain language, and whose hard-to-be-understood
                  sea phrases are meant to convey the impression that the utterer could have but one
                  idea in his head, and that idea, a ship. No, Captain Ely was a good-hearted,
                  intelligent, plain-spoken man, proud of his position in life, independent in
                  feeling, and very fond of his son.</p>
               <p>'What is it, Jemmy, my boy?' he asked, as the youth held the note towards him.</p>
               <p>'O, such news!' was the exultant reply, 'but read it—read it for yourself!'</p>
               <p>The old seaman adjusted his spectacles, and after reading the note carefully, he
                  handed it back with the remark—</p>
               <p>'Very pretty, Jemmy—very pretty indeed—and since you are so deeply interested in
                  the matter, I'm glad the stiff old gentleman whom you are anxious to call
                  father-in-law, has condescended to unbend a little. I must say, however, it would
                  have pleased me better if you could have made up your mind to forget the young
                  lady.'</p>
               <p>'Why so, father?' exclaimed the youth, complainingly, 'I don't see why you should
                  dislike Estelle. Ah, you don't know her, or you wouldn't say so.'</p>
               <p>'I don't dislike Estelle, my son,' replied the old man quietly, 'on the contrary,
                  from what I have seen of her from the window I am inclined to think her a very
                  nice sort of young lady—a little too fiery, perhaps, though that is a fault which
                  age and experience will remedy, in all probability—but if she was the most
                  virtuous and lovely girl that ever lived I should girl wish that you could forget
                  her.'</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6405-00000026"/>
               <p>'May I ask why?' enquired James, with some anxiety.</p>
               <p>'Well, in the first place,' answered the old man, 'you are both too young to think
                  of marrying yet. It don't make so much odds about the age of the girl, but I don't
                  think a man should marry till he's thirty at least. What do you know of the world?
                  Nothing. A young fellow at your age is apt to fall in love with a score of pretty
                  faces on the same night; and you don't know how soon you may meet with a damsel
                  whose beauty will eclipse that of Estelle, even in your estimation.'</p>
               <p>'O, no,' sighed the youth, '<emph>that</emph> is impossible.'</p>
               <p>'In the next place,' continued the old gentleman, without noticing the
                  interruption, 'you are poor, and the girl has been reared in the lap of luxury—she
                  can scarcely be supposed to have a mind of her own yet, and there's no telling
                  what effect an offer of marriage from a rich man—particularly if be were
                  accomplished and good-looking—would have upon her. It would be harder to give her
                  up after you have been for a length of time in the unrestricted enjoyment of her
                  society than it would now.'</p>
               <p>'O, I am <emph>sure</emph> of her love,' said James Ely, confidently.</p>
               <p>Then, again,' continued the old Captain, 'I don't much like the idea of forming
                  any connexion with a man who considers himself above me. I feel that I am as good
                  a man as Edward Grant the merchant—equal in birth, in intelligence, in integrity
                  of character—in everything except, perhaps, wealth, and that is no standard by
                  which to judge a man. I am also satisfied that in all the above regards, save the
                  last one, you are a fitting match for his daughter, but for all that, I know the
                  merchant holds a different opinion, and that makes the difference.'</p>
               <p>'Excuse me, father, but you misjudge the man,' said young Ely, earnestly, 'he may
                  have held a different opinion, but he does not now—else why has he authorized
                  Estelle to write this note?'</p>
               <p>'I cannot tell,' was the captain's reply, 'it may be all right, my boy, but I
                  cannot help thinking it somewhat singular that he should so suddenly alter his
                  opinion. A man who has carried certain ideas of caste throughout a long life
                  seldom changes them at the last hour. However, my boy, if you feel that your
                  happiness lies in that direction, and that direction only, follow the bent of your
                  inclination, and you have my earnest wishes for your complete success.'</p>
               <p>'Thank you, father,' said the youth, and folding up the note he put it away and
                  was soon afterwards at the side of the fair girl who had penned it.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>ABOUT six weeks after the events just detailed took place, Everard Emory and
                  Cornelius Hollowell, the <emph>speculator,</emph> sat in a well-furnished
                  apartment in the country residence of the former, in the town of ——, on the
                  Hudson. They were seated before a magnificent centre-table, upon which stood two
                  bottles containing wine, one of them nearly empty, and a couple of wine-glasses.
                  The face of Emory was somewhat flushed, but that of Hollowell wore its usually
                  pale and nervous aspect.</p>
               <p>'So you think her beautiful, eh?' questioned Emory, as he poured out a glass of
                  wine and proceeded to sip it.</p>
               <p>Beautiful!' echoed Hollowell, 'you may say that—you would say it if you saw her, I
                  know—beautiful as a houri, and proud as an Empress—won't allow an ordinary-looking
                  individual, like myself, to come within gun-shot of her. Shade of Venus, what an
                  exquisite form she has! Such a neck and bust! eyes, and hair, and such a
                  complexion! O, you should see her!'</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6405-00000027"/>
               <p>'And this young fool—this Ely,' said Emory, 'he actually supposes the old
                  gentleman intends to let him marry her?'</p>
               <p>'Supposes!' answered Hollowell, 'of course he does—he feels sure of it—he imagines
                  that his marriage is to take place shortly after mine, which comes off almost
                  immediately after my return. The ball-room plot to separate them, a full account
                  of which I have given you, must be successful, but woe unto those who take a part
                  in it, if it is ever afterwards discovered! That young Ely is a perfect
                  fire-eater—he and Estelle are both alike in that respect—either of them would die,
                  if necessary, to be revenged.'</p>
               <p>'Did I understand you to say the boy was poor?' asked Emory.</p>
               <p>'Yes,' was the reply, 'poor as Job's turkey—receives a miserable pittance of six
                  hundred a-year—but I suppose he thinks the old boy will make that all right after
                  the knot is tied. By the way, Emory, between you and me, what's the old fellow
                  worth?'</p>
               <p>'Why, I can't say, exactly,' replied Emory, 'but I suppose he must be worth
                  something handsome by this time—say two hundred thousand dollars or so,' and as he
                  uttered the abominable lie, the hypocrite washed his throat out with a swallow of
                  wine.</p>
               <p>'Two hundred thousand,' repeated Hollowell, scarcely able to conceal his
                  gratification, 'well, that <emph>is</emph> something handsome.'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' said Emory,(and if his companion had been watching for it he might have
                  observed a malicious sneer playing about his mouth as he spoke) 'you will be a
                  fortunate man if you marry in such a family.'</p>
               <p>'O, as to that,' replied Hollowell, carelessly, 'it matters but little to me about
                  the money; of course I had rather the old gentleman should be rich than otherwise,
                  but I don't expect to finger any of his cash. I am comfortable enough without
                  that.'</p>
               <p>'O, of course, of course,' replied Emory; 'as you say, it is gratifying to know
                  that those with whom we come into relationship tionship are wealthy, even if we
                  are beyond the reach of want ourselves.'</p>
               <p>'By the way, Emory,' suddenly said Hollowell, 'talking of money, reminds me that I
                  am rather short just at present, and want to raise a thousand. I have a promissory
                  note for that amount at ninety days on a responsible person in St. Louis with
                  whom, as well as the endorsers, you are doubtless acquainted. What'll you do it
                  for?'</p>
               <p>And as he finished speaking, he passed the note to Emory, who, after examining it
                  carefully, said—</p>
               <p>'Well, seeing that it's you, I suppose I can accommodate you for about a hundred
                  and fifty.'</p>
               <p>'Almost too much, Emory, by George!' exclaimed Hollowell; 'however, I want the
                  money, so let's have it, and say no more about it'.</p>
               <p>Emory placed the note in his wallet, filled up a check for the amount less the
                  discount, and passed it to Hollowell, who trembled somewhat as he received it,
                  though this was not perceived by Emory.</p>
               <p>'When do you propose returning to St. Louis?' questioned Emory, after a short
                  pause.</p>
               <p>'Well, in the course of about three weeks, I suppose,' was the reply. 'I have
                  considerable business to settle up here before I go, and it will depend somewhat
                  on my industry.' Then, affecting a yawn, he pulled out his watch, and remarking
                  that it was nearly twelve o'clock, he took his departure, and made his way to the
                  hotel at which he was stopping.</p>
               <p>As soon as the door had closed upon him, a half-maudlin chuckle came up from the
                  depths of Emory's bosom, and he muttered—</p>
               <p>'I do love to bleed these fools! ha! ha! ha! The idea of his attempting to gull me
                  into the story that he didn't care for the old man's money. Wonder if he thought I
                  had lived in this world with my eyes open till this time for nothing. I don't know
                  that I'd have laid it on quite so thick as two hundred thou<pb n="54-55"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000028"/> sand, if I had not been provoked at his
                  unpardonable misconception of my character. Two hundred thousand—ha, ha, ha! Why,
                  old Grant must be some thousands worse off than nothing! But I'm secure—I hold the
                  documents which would enable me to wind him up at a week's notice. Hollowell
                  calculates upon marrying a fortune! I hope he may! Perhaps he will find one in the
                  many charms of the adorable Florence—but the two hundred thousand! O, that is too
                  much!' and again he indulged in that half-drunken, heartless chuckle.</p>
               <p>Had Everard Emory been aware of all the fact connected with the interview which
                  had just terminated betwen Cornelius Hollowell and himself, he would not, perhaps,
                  have felt quite so merry. Had he known that the speculator had palmed off upon him
                  a forged note, and received good money therefor, he would have come to the
                  conclusion that the two hundred thousand dollar story had cost him something; but
                  he did no know it, and consequently he was in an excellent humor with himself.
                  After yawning heavily once or twice, he swallowed another glass of wine, and
                  rising from his chair, he half staggered to the door, but just as he was about
                  turning the knob, a footstep upon the lawn outside caught his ear, and listening
                  attentively, he muttered, as he heard the sound of a key in the night-latch—</p>
               <p>'There's Cantwell—I didn't expect him up before to-morrow night—I wonder if
                  anything has gone wrong,' and retracing his steps he seated himself just as the
                  individual he had alluded to as Cantwell knocked at the door. 'Come in,' he
                  growled, and the next moment the person who, some years before, had caused the
                  death of poor Thomas Gardener, the shoemaker, in the hovel in Cannon street, by
                  the abrupt announcement that he must produce the money for the rent or 'bundle
                  out,' stood before him. He was a man about thirty-five years of age—of medium
                  height and rather stout—his lack-lustre eyes were of a dingy gray color—his hair
                  sparse, and of a mixed gray and auburn—his face was pale, but its hue was not the
                  result of illness or a delicate constitution—it was of that unnatural, death-like,
                     <emph>clayey</emph> paleness which springs from deep thought and constant
                  excitement, and its whiteness was rendered more apparent by the entire absence of
                  anything like a beard—his nose was prominent, his cheek-bones high, his mouth
                  large, and when he spoke he displayed two rows of very large teeth of dazzling
                  whiteness—he was dressed in an entire suit of black, and his neck was encircled by
                  a white choker with an ample bow in front, giving him a decidedly clerical
                  appearance.</p>
               <p>'Well, George,' said Emory, in a tone of evident uneasiness, after the individual
                  just described had dropped himself quietly into the chair, which, a short time
                  previously, had been vacated by Hollowell, 'what has brought you up so soon? Has
                  anything of moment transpired?'</p>
               <p>Before the interrogatory was answered, the person to whom it was put took out his
                  handkerchief leisurely and wiped the perspiration from his brow—he then unbuttoned
                  his wristbands, turned them over his coat-cuffs, and deliberately reaching the
                  wine swallowed two glasses of it, one after the other—then carefully wiping his
                  mouth, and drawing a long breath, he answered in a whining tone, and with a slow,
                  measured enunciation, as though he weighed the importance of each word before
                  giving it utterance—</p>
               <p>Well, no—nothing to speak of—that is to say, nothing serious.'</p>
               <p>'I will add twenty-five per cent to your salary,' said Emory, 'if you will drop
                  that expression, 'nothing serious.' You bring it in upon every occasion, and I
                  never can take your true meaning from it, for I verily believe that if half my
                  possessions were swept away, and it were left for you to give the intelligence,
                  you would pronounce it 'nothing serious' before you gave me the particulars. Now,
                  then, what has happened? Has that <emph>new arrival</emph> escaped from her
                  vigilant friend and tutor?'</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6405-00000029"/>
               <p>'No,' was the answer, 'she has not escaped, but certain parties know where she is,
                  and although of course no part in the transaction can be traced to you, even if
                  she is found, you had better secure her at once if you want her. Otherwise it will
                  cost you something serious to keep her.'</p>
               <p>A silence of some five minutes ensued, during which Emory seemed buried in intense
                  thought, and Cantwell helped himself to another glass of wine. At length the
                  former said:</p>
               <p>'I guess, George, the old woman had better let her go—I don't want her.'</p>
               <p>'What!' exclaimed Cantwell, with a countenance indicative of the greatest
                  surprise—'lose such a chance as that?—you don't mean it, surely!'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' replied Emory, 'I do—the fact is, I am growing somewhat tired of this kind
                  of business—there is too much trouble about it—besides it's rather
                  dangerous—twice, already, vague rumors which have awakened considerable suspicion
                  have found their way into the church, and although money freely expended has had a
                  potent effect in stilling the tongues of tattlers, I may not always be so
                  successful.'</p>
               <p>'I suppose, also,' said Cantwell, with a malicious chuckle, 'that there are
                  certain reminiscences connected with the family of the <emph>new arrival,</emph>
                  as you term her, which are far from pleasant?'</p>
               <p>'Beast!' growled Emory, fixed his eyes full upon the face of his visitor, 'how
                  dare you make allusion to that affair? Are you not as culpable—nay more culpable
                  than I am?'</p>
               <p>'Well you need not get in such a passion about it,' said Cantwell—'perhaps I was
                  wrong to touch upon that point, and I'll not do so again.'</p>
               <p>See that you do not!' snarled the dark-browed man, and then after a few moments'
                  reflection, he continued, in a more friendly tone, 'The fact is, George, I have
                  chalked out an entirely new course—one which I know will surprise you. I am going
                  to get married!' When the last sentence left the lips of Emory, Cantwell was
                  conveying a wine-glass to his mouth, but he held it suspended between his thumb
                  and finger half way in its progress, and with his eyes fixed upon his employer, he
                  stared at him as though he thought him crazy. At length his astonishment exhausted
                  itself in a long whistle, and setting the wine back upon the table untasted, he
                  exclaimed—</p>
               <p>'Is it possible! well, that is something serious! May I ask how long it is since
                  you arrived at this determination?</p>
               <p>'About half an hour since,' was the reply.</p>
               <p>'And who is the happy woman?' enquired Cantwell—'you haven't been soft enough to
                  pay any attention to the tears of that bright-eyed little brunette, have you!'</p>
               <p>'Tush! no!' replied Emory impatiently, 'the wife I have in view is a person whom
                  you have never seen. I have not seen her myself in some time, but I have heard a
                  good report of her to-night, and I intend to marry her.'</p>
               <p>'Have you consulted the lady in the matter?' interrogated Cantwell.</p>
               <p>'O, no,' was the cool reply, 'if I had to wait for her consent, I fear the affair
                  would not come off, but fortunately her wishes in the matter are of not the
                  slightest importance. She must be Mrs. Emory whether she likes it or not, or I
                  have mistaken the character of her father.'</p>
               <p>'Ho! ho!' giggled Cantwell, 'something serious the matter in that direction, eh?
                  You've got the old gentleman this way, have you?' and he turned an imaginary
                  screw, accompanying the action with a gesticulation of pain. 'Where is the future
                  Mrs. E. at the present time?' he added, when his pantomime had ceased.</p>
               <p>'She's in St. Louis,' was the reply, 'but I will have her on here shortly. In the
                  mean time I shall make this my home permanently, and leave my entire business in
                  the city in your hands. I can do so with perfect safety I know,' he continued
                  significantly, at the same time fixing his keen black eye upon<pb n="58-59"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000030"/> the countenance of Cantwell with an expression
                  which caused that individual to cower beneath it, 'for should I discover that you
                  have been remiss in your duty, there would indeed be <emph>something
                     serious</emph> the matter.'</p>
               <p>'I understand,' said Cantwell, cringingly, 'all right—your affairs will be as safe
                  in my hands as though they were in your own—and now, as I feel somewhat sleepy,
                  you will excuse me if I say good night,' and lighting a lamp he took his way to
                  the room set apart for him. When he had reached his apartment he threw himself
                  into a chair and sat for some time gazing on vacancy. He was evidently in deep
                  thought, and at length, as a demoniacal smile played upon his hypocritical face,
                  he muttered to himself—'Everard Emory's a smart man—a shrewd man—I might say a
                  particularly sharp man—but I'll fool him yet! He has got me now, 'tis true—an
                  accessory before the fact in a murder case is something serious, there's no
                  denying that—but the accessory, if goaded too far, may actually commit murder to
                  free himself from a dangerous witness. You don't think of that, Mr. Everard Emory,
                  do you? No, no—you don't think that George Cantwell has nerve enough to use subtle
                  poison a second time—but he has, though—he has—and he'll do it in self-defence, if
                  you push him too far,' and pulling off his coat, he threw himself upon the bed,
                  and was soon in an uneasy slumber.</p>
               <p>Shortly after Cantwell had laid himself down, Emory also, proceeded to his
                  chamber, and he likewise indulged in some reflections before retiring, though the
                  thoughts to which he gave utterance were very different from those expressed by
                  his apprehensive yet desperate employee. 'I must wind the old man up,' he
                  muttered, as he stretched himself out—'I must have his daughter—the description
                  Hollowell gave of her has set me on fire, and I must have her, let it cost what it
                  will. Proud, is she? and passionate, too? Well, so much the better—that's what I
                  want—I like opposition, especially in a woman. It will be such pastime to humble
                  her pride! such recreation to curb her temper! Besides, I will be doing her a
                  kindness—pride and passion are execrable qualities in a young lady, and that man
                  is a true Christian who strives to eradicate them. O, I'll make an angel of her,
                  if such a thing is possible! I wonder if that scoundrel, Cantwell, dare attempt to
                  play any tricks upon me? Psha! no—I have too fast a hold upon him—still must be
                  wary—I must throw away no chances—I know him to be both cunning and treacherous,
                  and but that I have him safely in my power I should be fearful of him,' and while
                  muttering such sentences as these, drowsiness gradually crept over the dark-souled
                  man, and in a little while he slept the uneasy sleep of the wicked.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <p>ABOUT three weeks previous to the interview between Emory and Cantwell before
                  related, the inhabitants of a pleasant country village in the State of
                  Connecticut—at least the more piously inclined portion of the inhabitants—were
                  enraptured by the appearance among them, at a camp-meeting, of a very eloquent
                  divine (the Rev. Ebenezer Waffles) accompanied by his mother, an elderly and
                  seemingly a very devout lady. Everybody was talking of the powerful discourses
                  delivered by the minister—who came highly recommended from New York—the number of
                  conversions he was daily making, and the Christian meekness and humble piety of
                  his unpretending mother. Almost every family in the place had invited them to make
                  a call and great jealousy existed among the villagers as to whose house should be
                  next honored by the presence of<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6405-00000031"/> the
                  distinguished strangers. Among all the residences at which they stopped, however,
                  none seemed to please them so well as that of the widow Wallace—a truly pious
                  woman who was very poor, but who had seen better days. She had been twice married,
                  her first husband having been a merchant who died abroad, leaving but little
                  property behind him, and her second a sea captain who died at sea leaving her
                  almost destitute. By this last marriage she had an only daughter now about sixteen
                  years of age. The reader has already been introduced to a near relation of this
                  excellent woman under very melancholy circumstances, as will presently appear.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Waffles and her amiable son could not have been actuated by any mercenary
                  motives in giving the preference to Mrs. Wallace's humble abode over that of any
                  of her more well-to-do neighbors, for she possessed very little of this world's
                  goods, although her heart was full of Christian charity, and she was always
                  willing to share her last crust with the needy wayfarer. Her daughter Helen, too,
                  was like her. Naturally sweet-tempered and dutiful, the example and tuition of her
                  excellent mother had rendered her unspotted heart a temple full of the 'beauty of
                  holiness,' and she was as lovely in person as in spirit. Somewhat tall and slender
                  in stature, she was light-footed as a fawn—the rose and lily mingled in her
                  complexion—her luxuriant hair was of a sunny golden color, her eyes large,
                  lustrous and heavenly blue, and her glad soul, so free from guile and from every
                  worldly taint, lit up her features with a radiant smile, exhibiting to all who
                  gazed upon her an evidence of that Christian peace 'which passeth
                  understanding.'</p>
               <p>'And have you no male relations whatever?' enquired the Rev. Mr. Waffles of the
                  widow, one morning, after having put forth an eloquent prayer for the widow and
                  the fatherless, 'no one upon whom you could call for assistance in the event of
                  persecution from the hardened and the vile?'</p>
               <p>'No, sir,' answered the widow, 'I have but one male relative—a boy nephew in New
                  York, my sister's child.'</p>
               <p>'And what is your sister's name?' enquired the reverend gentleman, with much
                  evident concern.</p>
               <p>'Rachel Gardener, sir,' was the reply.</p>
               <p>'You don't mean Rachel Gardener who lived some years ago, in Cannon street, New
                  York, and who was so shamefully turned out of house and home while her husband was
                  dying?' said Mr. Waffles, enquiringly.</p>
               <p>'The same, sir,' was the reply.</p>
               <p>'Poor thing,' said Waffles, 'I knew her very well, but I could only help her at
                  the time with my prayers, for I had impoverished myself in working for the
                  missionary cause. I waited upon Mr. Emory, however, and talked to him about it,
                  but all to no purpose; he wouldn't listen to me. Hard man, that Emory—very hard
                  man—I am inclined to think that something serious will happen to him one day or
                  other.'</p>
               <p>'New York is a dreadful place!' said Mrs. Waffles, groaning deeply, 'but at the
                  same time there are some advantages there for a young person which cannot be found
                  here. You know, Mrs. Wallace,' she continued, 'I was talking to you yesterday
                  about your allowing your daughter to enter my Seminary for young ladies. I
                  shouldn't expect one cent in the way of remuneration, if you would consent to part
                  with her. I don't know why I am so taken with her, but really I should esteem the
                  privilege of making her a classical scholar, and thus placing her beyond the reach
                  of want, quite a favor.'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' chimed in Mr. Waffles, 'I also feel deeply interested in the young lady's
                  welfare, and I pledge you my word that nothing serious shall happen to her if you
                  let her go.'</p>
               <p>'I don't know how I could very well part with her,' said Mrs. Wallace, the tears
                  starting to her eyes at the thought of it, 'she has never been away from me a day
                  since she was born, and to separate from her now would be very hard.'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' argued Mrs. Waffles, 'but the separation need not he a very long one—she
                  can visit you every week as she stays with me, for that matter. And only consider
                  of what you are<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6405-00000032"/> depriving her, if you
                  refuse to let her go! Not only of what you are depriving her, but yourself, for by
                  the time her education is finished she will be able to earn a living for you
                  both.'</p>
               <p>'I suppose it does seem very selfish in me,' said the poor widow, 'and I feel that
                  I ought to let her go. What do you say to the proposition, Helen?' she continued,
                  turning to her daughter, who had thus far taken no part in the conversation.</p>
               <p>'I should hate to leave you, mother,' replied the young girl, even for a week—but
                  then, I dare say, the advice of Mr. Waffles and Mrs. Waffles is good—I would be
                  willing to suffer a good deal, for the sake of being able at last to make you
                  comfortable and happy. After all, a week isn't such a <emph>very</emph> long time.
                  Besides, I shall have a chance to visit Aunt Rachael when I get to New York, and
                  while with her I will try to imagine I am with you.'</p>
               <p>'Spoken like a brave child!' said Mr. Waffles, encouragingly—'so you shall visit
                  your Aunt—I'll take you to her house myself, in a carriage—so let's consider the
                  matter settled. What say you, Mrs. Wallace? We leave on the day after to-morrow;
                  is it a bargain?'</p>
               <p>'I cannot say no,' answered the widow, after some hesitation, and turning away to
                  hide the tears which filled her eyes, she continued, 'she may go with you, but
                  remember that in her you hold my life. Should any serious accident happen to her
                  it would break my heart.'</p>
               <p>Of course both Mr. Waffles and his mother said that the possibility of harm coming
                  to her while she was under their protection, was not to be thought of, and of
                  course the mother, who had every faith in their integrity, believed them, so she
                  wrote at once to her sister, apprising her of the step which her daughter was
                  about to take, and after two days of dreary anticipation the dreaded time of
                  parting arrived, and with many tears she placed all that she held dear on earth
                  under the protection of her pious friends. As well might the pet lamb have been
                  placed under the protection of the wolf, for the Rev. Ebenezer Waffles and his
                  reputed mother were the creatures of Everard Emory's will, and the connection
                  existing between them will in time appear.</p>
               <p>Helen wept bitterly after she got on board the boat which was to bear her, for the
                  first time in her life, a distance from home. Her young heart was full of hope,
                  however, and under the well-assumed words of endearment and soothing remarks of
                  the two fiends who had her in charge, she soon rallied, and by the time the
                  steamer had reached her dock in New York, some hours afterwards, she felt more
                  resigned, and tried very hard to appear lively. She had scarcely time to give vent
                  to an exclamation of surprise at the busy scene which met her eyes upon the wharf,
                  and in the densely crowded streets, when a carriage, to the driver of which the
                  Rev. Mr. Waffles had beckoned, drove up, the door was opened, the party seated,
                  and the vehicle rolling rapidly over the cobblestone pavement. It was about dark
                  when the carriage drove up to a genteel-looking building, the door of which was
                  opened almost before the driver had jumped off his box, and the party admitted by
                  a short, stout, black woman Helen was taken at once to a magnificently-furnished
                  apartment, by Mrs. Waffles, who told her that as she was doubtless tired, she
                  might go to bed at once, and in the morning she would introduce her to her
                  class-mates. All at once it occurred to the poor child that she had not seen her
                  trunk put upon the carriage, and she made a remark to that effect.</p>
               <p>'Oh, never mind your trunk to-night, my child,' said the hag, 'that will be looked
                  after to-morrow. I don't think you will find use for any dresses you may have
                  brought with you. I am afraid they are not quite fashionable enough for the city.
                  In that wardrobe you will find every thing that you desire, and now, good night.'
                  She impressed a hypocritical kiss upon the pure cheek of Helen—her breath was like
                  a poisonous exhalation upon a spotless rose—and turned to leave the room—suddenly
                  she paused, however, and added, 'We are not in the<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000033"/> habit of rising very early in the morning, and you
                  will have to amuse yourself till the bell rings the best way you can. You will
                  find books upon various subjects on the table, and if you wish to write, you will
                  find everything necessary for that purpose in the drawer.'</p>
               <p>In another moment Helen was alone. No, not entirely alone, for her guardian angel
                  was near her, whispering hope and consolation to her heart, and, kneeling by the
                  bedside, she poured forth her whole soul in earnest prayer to Him who 'tempers the
                  wind to the shorn lamb.' She prayed first for her mother, then for the kind
                  benefactors who had voluntarily taken her under their patronage—then for all her
                  friends (and enemies, if she had any,) and finally for herself—that she might
                  always live a pure and holy life, and be diligent in her studies, and have
                  resolution to carry out the wishes of those who had so befriended her. Poor girl!
                  she little knew <emph>how</emph> they had, befriended her, but even if the veil
                  had been suddenly lifted from her eyes, she would still have prayed for them—would
                  have prayed that they might be brought to realize the extent of their terrible
                  wickedness.</p>
               <p>She was not long in getting to sleep, for health and innocence are great opiates,
                  but she did not slumber as soundly in that large and splendidly furnished
                  apartment as she had slumbered in her little bed-room at home. The pure air, and
                  the scent of the honeysuckle clambering around the lattice, and the chirp of the
                  cricket breaking the solemn stillness of night, and many other little things
                  peculiar to the country, were wanting, and her rest was consequently somewhat
                  uneasy.</p>
               <p>She might have slept some six or eight hours, when suddenly she was awakened by
                  the cry of 'Murder!' proceeding from a female in the street. Such sounds at the
                  dead hour of the night are very common in the city, especially in the locality
                  where poor Helen then was, but they are seldom heard in the quiet country, and the
                  poor girl sprang from her bed terribly frightened, and rushing to the window,
                  looked out. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and everything in the street could
                  be seen as distinctly as at noonday. As she gazed forth, again that terrible cry
                  rang in her ears, and caused the blood to curdle in her veins. The next moment a
                  man came rushing from an alley-way opposite, and fled rapidly up the street—then
                  came the sound of the watchman's club, and the heavy tramp of many feet in the
                  direction of the cry—and then a number of people, one after the other, rushed
                  rapidly past in the direction which the man who emerged from the alley-way had
                  taken. Presently the shuffling of feet, and the murmur of confused voices, as
                  though a crowd had assembled at the corner above, fell upon her ear, and then a
                  terrible scuffle apparently took place, and then she heard those who had but just
                  ran past, returning. Loud oaths and imprecations, which caused the pure-minded
                  girl to close her ears up, fell from many lips, as the party drew near, and when
                  they had arrived opposite, she noticed that two officers had a man in custody,
                  whose clothes were very much torn, and whose face, as she caught a glimpse of it
                  in the moonlight, was full of blood. They stopped in front of the alley-way from
                  out of which the cry of murder had proceeded, and shortly afterwards a woman was
                  brought out, and Helen observed that her clothes also had been torn nearly off her
                  back, and that her face was bruised and bloody. The whole party then again moved
                  on, and when the noise of their retiring footsteps had died away in the distance,
                  the silent watcher at the window found herself trembling violently in every joint.
                  While the scene so unusual to her was being enacted, her excitement had sustained
                  her, but after the cause of her excitement had ceased, she found the cold sweat
                  standing in large drops upon her brow, and her heart beating fearfully.</p>
               <p>It was some time before she could make up her mind to lay down again, and she
                  wished heartily that it was daylight, but at length she summoned up all her
                  philosophy, and inwardly breathing a short petition, she was about to go to bed
                     again<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6405-00000034"/> when she was suddenly startled,
                  by shouts of boisterous mirth below stairs, in which she thought she could
                  distinguish the voices of the Rev. Mr. Waffles and his pious mother.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <p>HELEN knew not what to make of this unlooked-for noise. Up to this time not a
                  suspicion of the true character of her new-found friends had entered her mind, for
                  guileless herself she never looked for deceit in others, especially when they wore
                  the garb of Christianity. The scene which she had just witnessed opposite had only
                  disturbed her serenity of mind—not awakened her doubts—but when she heard this
                  'sound of revelry by night,' participated in by two persons whom she had been led
                  to suppose would frown down the slightest semblance of levity, she became really
                  alarmed. A thousand distracting thoughts crowded into her brain at once. She
                  remembered having read in the newspapers while at home accounts of the arts
                  practiced by designing persons in the city upon friendless girls, and although she
                  could not bring herself to believe that she had fallen into a snare, still she
                  felt very uncomfortable, and wished—O, how ardently!—that she was safely at the
                  side of her mother, in her little cottage home.</p>
               <p>She made a strong effort, however, to check her thick-coming fancies, and was
                  about to seek forgetfulness in slumber once more, when again the frightful noise
                  which had at first alarmed her grated harshly upon her ears, banishing every
                  thought of sleep, and bringing her once more to her feet upon the floor.</p>
               <p>For a moment or two, in her perturbation, she walked distractedly up and down the
                  apartment, and at length seated herself near the window from which she had but a
                  short time previously looked out upon the street, and burying her face in her
                  hands, she endeavored to call forth from the depths of her troubled imaginings,
                  some plan of escape from the terrible abode into which she was now certain she had
                  been entrapped.</p>
               <p>'Persons who are bad enough and bold enough,' she thought, 'to take such means as
                  they have taken to inveigle me here, will stop at nothing to accomplish their full
                  designs, and if I cannot escape from them, what will become of me? I shall be
                  forced to associate with the vicious and the degraded—to witness scenes at which
                  my soul will revolt—to listen to language which will be like deadly poison in my
                  ears—to be surrounded day and night by all that is impure and
                  heart-corroding—perhaps to grow familiar with and indifferent to it!—O, no, no,
                  no!—not that—not that! forgive me, Heaven, for the wicked thought I But how can I
                  escape? Should I even succeed in gaining the street, where shall I go at the dead
                  hour of night? I do not know how to find my aunt's house, and if I did, could I
                  walk unmolested through the city? But perhaps I am too fast—these people may not
                  be so wicked—so <emph>very</emph> wicked—as I am led to think them—perhaps the
                  peculiar circumstances by which I am surrounded, have led me to put too serious a
                  construction upon the matter—at least I will be satisfied that my suspicions are
                  well founded. Courage, Helen, courage! Put your trust in the Father of the
                  Friendless, and all may yet be well!' and approaching the door of her apartment,
                  she cautiously opened it, and listened attentively.</p>
               <p>The shouts of merriment had ceased, and save the suppressed murmur of voices in
                  the room below, not a sound was to be heard. The hall lamp was still burning
                  brilliantly, and softly stepping on tip-toe to the head of the stairs, she began
                  step by step to descend. She could feel her temples throb and hear the beating of
                  her own heart as she reached the bottom of the staircase, and approached the door
                  of the drawing-room, at the<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6405-00000035"/> keyhole of
                  which she applied her eye, and looked in upon the party whose orgies had disturbed
                  her.</p>
               <p>The sight which met her gaze, and the few sentences which she was enabled to catch
                  convinced her that her first fears had not been premature. There were some four or
                  five persons in the room, though the scope of Helen's vision could take in but
                  three. These were the Rev. Mr. Waffles, Mrs. Waffles, and a dissipated-looking
                  young man about twenty years of age, who sat opposite the two first-mentioned
                  parties, with a glass of wine in his hand which he occasionally sipped leisurely,
                  as though already surfeited. The countenance of this youth was not
                  unprepossessing, and but for an air of recklessness, and a certain
                     <emph>animal</emph> expression about the mouth, joined with the extravagant
                  style in which he was dressed, one might have wondered a little at finding him in
                  such company. Both Mr. and Mrs. Waffles had evidently been indulging rather freely
                  in the exhilarating beverage which stood upon the table near which they were
                  sitting, and the former showed unmistakeable signs of inebriation.</p>
               <p>'I'd like to see her,' were the first words which Helen heard after she had taken
                  her position at the door. They were uttered by the young man above mentioned, 'I'd
                  like to see her,' he said, 'if she's so beautiful—but of course your saying so is
                  no proof of the fact—you'd call her handsome if she was as homely as a
                  stone-fence.'</p>
               <p>'What odds does it make to you, Bob,' hiccoughed the Rev. Mr. Waffles, 'whether
                  she's good-looking or ill-looking? She's not for you, anyhow!'</p>
               <p>'Well, suppose she isn't for me,' was the reply, 'I don't s'pose looking at her
                  would hurt her, would it?'</p>
               <p>I don't know whether it would hurt her or not,' broke in Mrs. Waffles, 'but I know
                  it wouldn't be very agreeable to the feelings of a certain gentleman if he knew we
                  had exhibited her to anybody, and so I tell you once for all you can't be
                  introduced to her till we hear from the gentleman aforesaid. If he don't feel
                  inclined to cultivate her acquaintance, you can—if he does, you can't—that's all
                  about it.'</p>
               <p>'It strikes me,' said the youth, assuming a grave expression of countenance, 'that
                  you are over particular about this new boarder, and your anxiety to keep her out
                  of the way leads me to suppose that everything isn't on the square! I hope you
                  haven't been inveigling another innocent girl into the house. If I thought such
                  was the case, curse me if I wouldn't withdraw my patronage from you forever. I'm
                  bad enough, but I never could descend to any such business as that.'</p>
               <p>'You're always imagining something, Bob,' said Mrs. Waffles, in a slightly
                  alarmed, but conciliatory tone—'what do you suppose I would want to run any such
                  risk for, when I can make more money by doing a legitimate business? The whole
                  long and short of the matter is, we are going to 'sell' an old fool who has plenty
                  of money.'</p>
               <p>'Well, then, if I can't see her,' said the youth, apparently satisfied with the
                  hag's explanation, 'I may as well be going—so good night!' and as he spoke he
                  picked up his hat and arose to depart.</p>
               <p>It was now time for Helen to leave the dangerous position which she had for some
                  moments occupied, and springing lightly to the stairs, she fled swiftly, but
                  noiselessly up, and succeeded unobserved, in reaching the room which had been set
                  apart for her, just as the street-door closed upon Bob. The character of the
                  parties by whom Helen was surrounded, was now clearly apparent to her, but,
                  instead of sinking under her trials she seemed to gather resolution and strength
                  as her case grew more desperate. The hours which intervened till morning seemed
                  ages to her, but the daylight came at last, and with it came hope to the
                  watch-weary and grief-laden girl. She had made up her mind to betray no uneasiness
                  while in the presence of the diabolical old hag whose prisoner she had become, but
                  to seize the first opportunity that offered to escape. Accordingly when, at 10
                  o'clock she was called down<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6405-00000036"/> to breakfast,
                  she assumed a cheerfulness which she was far from feeling, and went through the
                  ceremony of introduction to her <emph>class-mates</emph> with as good a grace as
                  possible, although in her soul she loathed them, and an involuntary shudder crept
                  over her as she suffered them, one after another, to embrace her.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Waffles, whom the reader by this time must have discovered to be no
                  Jess a personage than the detestable wretch, George Cantwell, met her at the
                  breakfast-table with an hypocritical greeting. He still kept up the holy character
                  which he had assumed, for it was the intention of himself, and of the horrible
                  wretches with whom he was leagued, to corrupt the mind of the victim by degrees,
                  if possible, deeming it the safest and easiest way of gaining the entire control
                  of her. Accordingly, after <emph>family prayer,</emph> in which all joined
                  (although there was but one earnest pleader among them, and she did pour out her
                  whole soul in a petition for escape,) the blasphe-mous Cantwell said grace, and
                  breakfast was then partaken of by all save Helen, who pleaded a slight headache as
                  an excuse for abstinence. After the meal was over, Cantwell gave Helen a deal of
                  excellent advice, in the course of which he urged her above all things to obey
                  Mrs. Waffles in the minutest particular, assuring her that if she did so, she
                  could not, by any possibility of means, go wrong. He then took his departure, and
                  that night he was on his way to Emory's residence on the Hudson. He had notified
                  his employer the day before, by letter, of his success in entrapping Helen, and
                  what passed between the two when they met is already known to the reader.</p>
               <p>Helen watched throughout the live-long day for a chance to escape, but in vain.
                  The old woman was untiring in her vigilance, and did not leave her a moment alone
                  till night came, and then she allowed her, as on the night previous, to retire to
                  her room. This time, however, the poor girl did not go to bed. She had firmly
                  resolved, that whether failure or success attended her, she would make the attempt
                  to escape that night. She did make the attempt, and she succeeded. It occurred to
                  her that, if she could reach the basement entry unperceived, she might meet with a
                  favorable opportunity of slipping out, for she had noticed, among other sounds,
                  while listening, that the basement door was frequently opened and shut by the
                  servants passing back and forth. Accordingly, she took off the dress which the old
                  woman had insisted upon her wearing, and, putting on her own, she watched her
                  opportunity, and at about ten o'clock, when everything, save the whispered
                  conversation of the guests in the parlor, seemed still about the house, she
                  slipped noiselessly out of her room, and scarcely drawing her breath, she fled
                  with the swiftness of a spirit of air down the stairs, through the hall to the
                  basement staircase, down the basement stairs, through the entry below, and was
                  just about feeling for the latch, when she heard a footfall descending the stone
                  steps outside. Drawing back, she crouched in the corner behind the sidelights, and
                  as the door opened, and the stout black woman, who had attended at the street door
                  on the evening of her arrival, passed in, she slipped out adroitly, and the next
                  moment she found herself in the street, and at liberty. She fled rapidly along,
                  she knew not whither, but at the moment it was immaterial to her—all she wished
                  was to get as far as possible from the hateful scene of her late harassing trials.
                  She turned every corner she came to, but had not progressed far when she was
                  suddenly brought to a stand-still by a policeman, who seizing her rudely by the
                  arm, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>'Yer needn't try to dodge me in that way—I've had orders to take in every one o'
                  yer that I meet, and I'm a goin' to do it, so come along!'</p>
               <p>'O, don't take me to prison, pray don't!' exclaimed the affrighted girl, who up to
                  this moment thought of no other danger than that of being retaken by Mrs.
                  Waffles—'I have not committed any crime, indeed I have not!'</p>
               <p>'O, yer can't fool me by tryin' to play off green—come<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000037"/> along—it'll only be a month or two on the Island,
                  and it'll do yer good—come along!' and in spite of her tears and entreaties he was
                  leading her along towards the Station House, followed by a troop of ragged boys
                  and idle men, when on turning a corner another policeman joined him.</p>
               <p>'Hello, Ben!' asked the new comer, 'who have you got there?'</p>
               <p>'O, one of the gals, Jack,' was the reply, 'and I'm a goin' to take her in.</p>
               <p>'Stop a minute; Ben,' said he who had been addressed as Jack, 'I'm thinking you've
                  made a little mistake this time—that gal don't look like a bad one, and I'll bet
                  she ain't either'—then addressing Helen, he continued, 'what's yer name, Sis, and
                  where do you live?'</p>
               <p>The unfortunate girl explained to him in utterances broken by sobs, and in as few
                  words as possible, that she had been inveigled from her home in the country—had
                  made her escape from her persecutors and wished to find her Aunt's residence.</p>
               <p>'And what street does your Aunt live in, you poor little thing?' questioned the
                  policeman in a tone of compassion.</p>
               <p>'I have heard my mother say,' answered Helen, in a tone of despair, 'but I have
                  forgotten.'</p>
               <p>'O, humbug!' exclaimed the man who had first arrested her, 'that won't go
                  down.'</p>
               <p>'One moment, Ben,' said the better natured policeman, in a deprecating tone, 'one
                  moment—I've got sisters myself, I have, and I shouldn't like to hear of one of 'em
                  bein' ill-treated—and I don't want to see a good gal unjustly suspicioned'—then
                  turning to Helen again, he continued, 'what's your Aunt's name, young woman?'</p>
               <p>'Mrs. Gardener,' replied Helen.'</p>
               <p>'Mrs. Gardener, eh?' said the policeman, pricking up his ears, 'and what's her
                  Christian name?'</p>
               <p>'Rachel,' answered Helen.</p>
               <p>'Has she got any children?' enquired the policeman, evidently excited.</p>
               <p>'Yes, two,' answered Helen, who by this time had dried her tears, and began to
                  feel quite at ease, 'she has a son and a daughter—Thomas and Mary Gardener.'</p>
               <p>'Good enough!' cried the policeman, exultingly, 'then you are my little Molly's
                  cousin! Well, what strange things do happen! I expected to see you soon, for Molly
                  told me you was coming, but I didn't dream of meetin' you at such a time and under
                  such circumstances as these! Come along—but not to the Station House!' and as the
                  policeman who had arrested her made no opposition after hearing his friend Jack's
                  explanation, the latter led her away, and in half-an-hour afterwards she was
                  sobbing and laughing together in the arms of her Aunt, and trying to answer the
                  thousand questions put to her by her two cousins at the same time.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>WE must now return to our St. Louis friends. Hollowell had got back from New York,
                  and in view of his approaching nuptials with Florence was making as extensive a
                  show as possible with the thousand dollars which he had succeeded in obtaining by
                  means of the forged note from Everard Emory. He was a close calculator, and knew
                  exactly how long a certain amount of money would enable him to keep up a certain
                  style. He had demonstrated to his own perfect satisfaction, by an arithmetical
                  test, that he would be obliged to spend his last dollar upon the night of his
                  wedding, beyond which event<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6405-00000038"/> he did not
                  look for anything like pecuniary embarrassment, for he had no doubt that a
                  father-in-law in possession of two hundred thousand dollars would be only too
                  happy to part with a portion of it to the husband of his daughter. In fact,
                  Hollowell had determined in his own mind that he would at first, just for the
                  appearance of the thing, reject the liberal offer which he knew Mr. Grant would
                  make him. He had led the old man to suppose that he was in very comfortable
                  circumstances himself, and did not expect anything with his wife, so that the
                  subject of a settlement had never been hinted at; and while Hollowell was
                  cherishing the idea that his marriage with Florence would enable him to gratify
                  his money-spending propensities without transgressing any law save that of
                  domestic economy, the old gentleman was felicitating himself with the thought that
                  the wealth of his son-in law might, perhaps, assist in restoring his fallen
                  fortunes—this was likewise the hope uppermost in Florence's mind, for it is almost
                  needless to say that she had not a particle of love for the man whom she had
                  promised to marry. Estelle and James Ely had been completely deceived by the
                  specious conduct of all around them, and they did not dream while they were
                  enjoying each other's society without restraint, that the wily Fanny had prepared
                  a blast which, when ignited, must destroy their happiness forever.</p>
               <p>Thus matters stood when a grand private and select entertainment was given by Mr.
                  Charles Tieman, a retired merchant of St. Louis. The affair had been in course of
                  preparation some time, and the Grants, as well as James Ely and Cornelius
                  Hollowell had been among the first guests invited. It was to be the 'last affair
                  of the season,' and it was expected that it would be the most showy. For a whole
                  year a like opportunity would not offer itself to the gay and fashionable friends
                  of the wealthy merchant, for the display of fine dresses, finer speeches, and
                  still finer airs, and they were consequently determined to show to the very best
                  advantage.</p>
               <p>'That white crape will look lovely, Estelle,' cried Fanny Grant, as the three
                  sisters were engaged in selecting dresses for the forthcoming <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">soiree.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>'Do you think so?' said Estelle, who, under her altered circumstances had almost
                  forgotten her sister's former cruel treatment, 'do you think so, Fanny?—why you
                  used to say that blue silk was more becoming.'</p>
               <p>'I used to think so,' replied Fanny, 'but I do not now. You cannot select anything
                  in which you look so charming as in a white crape, festooned with roses. Is not
                  that your opinion, Florence?'</p>
               <p>'Decidedly,' answered Florence.</p>
               <p>'Well, I won't set my judgment against that of two who should know better than
                  myself,' said Estelle, gaily, 'and the white crape it shall be. I hope James will
                  like it, and I don't care who else it suits.'</p>
               <p>'You shall make the finest appearance of any young lady in the room,' said Fanny,
                  'if my taste is good for anything—and I think it is—for I intend to take especial
                  pains with you. It is my desire that your natural good looks should be enhanced in
                  a ten-fold degree, if possible.'</p>
               <p>'You are very kind,' said Estelle, gratefully.</p>
               <p>'Don't mention it,' returned Fanny, 'I shall be doing no more than my duty, and
                  shall consider myself fully repaid if your appearance excites the attention which
                  I think it will.'</p>
               <p>For once in her life Fanny Grant was sincere in what she said. She did wish
                  Estelle to look beautiful. Not because she loved her any better than formerly, but
                  she had her object in it.</p>
               <p>Ten o'clock came, and a portion of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">elite</foreign> of
                  St. Louis had assembled at the splendid mansion of Mr. Charles Tieman to take part
                  in the festivities of the occasion, but amid all that blaze and splendor there
                  were few hearts that had ever felt a thrill of pure, unselfish joy. The desire to
                  see and be seen, to criticise, to gossip, and to whisper scandal, was
                     uppermost,<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6405-00000039"/> and the discovery of a
                  foible in a neighbor was much more satisfactory to the majority than the finding
                  out of a virtue.</p>
               <p>Fanny Grant, in her earnest endeavors to render Estelle beautiful had succeeded to
                  a miracle. James Ely thought she had never looked so charming, and he almost
                  worshipped as he gazed upon her. Her surpassing loveliness was the prevalent
                  remark, and there was but one other lady present whose general appearance could be
                  said to at all approach Estelle's. This was Miss Julia Durand, daughter of one of
                  Mr. Grant's partners, who, singularly enough, was dressed very similar to Estelle
                  herself, though her form was not so commanding, and her eyes lacked the vivacity
                  that sparkled in the dark orbs of Miss Grant.</p>
               <p>But a short time had passed by in the ball room when suddenly Fanny Grant
                  discovered that Estelle was looking very ill.</p>
               <p>'Heavens!' she exclaimed, addressing James Ely, who was about leading the fair
                  girl upon the floor to take part in a quadrille, 'the poor child is about to
                  faint! Don't you feel unwell, dear?</p>
               <p>'I do feel a little dizzy, and somewhat pressed for breath,' answered Estelle,
                  'and I think I won't dance this time.'</p>
               <p>'By no means!' exclaimed James Ely, in a tone of anxiety, 'I would not have you
                  attempt it for the world, if you do not feel like it!'</p>
               <p>'Come with me, love,' said Fanny Grant, assuming a tone of tenderness, 'let us
                  retire for a few moments from the glare of light and the heat of this room, which
                  is really oppressive, and I dare say your illness will pass over speedily.'</p>
               <p>'Yes, do go, Estelle,' urged James Ely, 'for my sake,' and thus importuned,
                  Estelle walked away with her sister, and her lover resumed the seat which he had
                  vacated.</p>
               <p>Two or three sets in the cotillion remained to be filled, and scarcely had Fanny
                  disappeared with Estelle in her charge when James saw Estelle's father walking
                  towards him with Miss Durand hanging upon his arm.</p>
               <p>'Ah, James, my boy,' he exclaimed with much apparent cordiality, 'you are
                  disengaged I see—allow me to introduce to you Miss Durand—I was looking up a
                  partner for her, and you are just the man.'</p>
               <p>It would have been rude in the young man to refuse, so proffering his arm to the
                  fair girl before him he led her upon the floor, and just as he did so, Fanny with
                  Estelle, who had already recovered from her momentary illness, at her side,
                  reentered the room.</p>
               <p>'Why, as I live,' exclaimed Fanny, 'James has found a partner already. He is about
                  to dance with Julia Durand, the belle of St. Louis, as she is called. Well, there
                  is no denying that she is rather pretty.'</p>
               <p>Instantly Estelle felt the hot blood rushing into her face, and the first pang of
                  jealousy which she had ever felt, shot through her heart. Suspicion is more keenly
                  awake in matters of love than in anything else, and instantly it occurred to her
                  that she had only the evening before made James acquainted with the fact that her
                  father was almost bankrupt and she penniless—this, joined with the fact that he
                  had urged her but a few moments before to retire, and had then instantly sought
                  out one conspicuous for her wealth and beauty (for Julia Durand possessed a small
                  fortune in her own right,) as a partner in the dance, was 'confirmation strong as
                  proofs of holy writ' to her mind that a change had taken place in his feelings.
                  She strove hard to conceal her sensations, however, and just at this time
                  Hollowell, accompanied by Philip Tieman, son of the wealthy host, advanced towards
                  them. Tiemann had often seen Estelle when she was a child, but some years had
                  elapsed since he had visited her father's house, and she had grown almost out of
                  his recollection. Advancing towards her he held out both hands and exclaimed—</p>
               <p>'Can it be possible that this is my little favorite, Estelle? Why, it seems but a
                  few short months since I was dancing her upon my knee! Egad, I have not reached
                  thirty yet, but<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6405-00000040"/> I shall begin shortly to
                  think that I am growing old'—then shaking both her hands warmly, he continued, 'if
                  you are not engaged, may I ask the favor of your company for the next
                  cotillion?'</p>
               <p>'She will not refuse so slight a favor to an old friend, I am sure,' broke in
                  Fanny, appealingly.</p>
               <p>Estelle felt like anything else but dancing, and under any other circumstances she
                  would have peremptorily declined, but her pride was touched, and she wished to let
                  James Ely see that if he could secure a rich <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >belle</foreign> as a partner she was no less fortunate in being able to secure
                  a wealthy <foreign xml:lang="FRA">beau.</foreign> So she accepted his invitation,
                  was led to the floor, and shortly afterwards the music struck up and the dance
                  commenced.</p>
               <p>The first figure of the cotillion had been scarcely gone through when James
                  discovered the form of Estelle moving lightly around in the dance a few 'sets'
                  from him. Instantly a disagreeable sensation of distrust and jealousy crept over
                  him, and he stood transfixed with wonderment till reminded by a gentle touch upon
                  the arm that he was detaining the dance. Rallying quickly he uttered a hasty
                  apology, and assuming an air of gaiety which he was only able to counterfeit with
                  the greatest difficulty, he managed to get through with the cotillion, after which
                  he led Miss Durand to a seat by the side of her father, thanked her for her
                  politeness, and sought a retired corner of the room where he might indulge in
                  reflection.</p>
               <p>'My father was right, after all,' he said to himself—'wealth does possess a charm
                  even for Estelle—her illness was assumed to get rid of me so that she might choose
                  a richer companion. Well, well, be it so—it will cost me a hard struggle, perhaps,
                  but I <emph>can</emph> give her up—I <emph>can</emph> learn to despise the sordid
                  soul that would barter the holiest feeling of which mankind is capable for gold—I
                     <emph>can</emph> learn to rejoice, even, that the mask was lifted, and the
                  hollow heart exposed, before it was too late—I <emph>can</emph> and I
                     <emph>will</emph> do all this, but it will be a terrible trial!'</p>
               <p>In the midst of these bitter reflections he was touched upon the shoulder, and
                  looking up he beheld Florence leaning upon Hollowell's arm.</p>
               <p>'James,' said that young lady, 'Estelle has requested me to say to you that you
                  must try and amuse yourself as well as you can for an hour or so, after which she
                  will be at your service. She has fallen in with a very old friend whom she is
                  anxious to entertain, and hopes you will excuse her.'</p>
               <p>'Tell Miss Grant,' replied young Ely, pointedly, 'that she is very excusable, and
                  that I have no doubt I shall be able to amuse myself very well for the remainder
                  of the evening, without troubling her at all.'</p>
               <p>Nay, nay, James,' said Florence, persuasively, 'you must not feel provoked at the
                  poor child. It is true she did not exactly right in deserting you so
                  unceremoniously for the society of another, but Mr. Tieman is a very old friend of
                  the family, and she, in her thoughtlessness, imagined she was justified in doing
                  as she did. I am sure she did not wish to offend you.'</p>
               <p>'O, of course not,' answered James, sarcastically. 'I suppos she thought I would
                  regard her feigning sickness as an excuse to git rid of me in the light of a
                  capital joke. I am sorry I cannot so look upon it, however. On the contrary, it
                  strikes me as a species of very low meanness, and so you can tell your sister if
                  you please. Good evening, Miss Florence,' and rising from his seat, he sought out
                  Miss Durand, with whom he was soon conversing as familiarly, and apparently with
                  as light a heart as though nothing had happened to ruffle the usually happy
                  current of his feelings.</p>
               <p>Florence lost no time in making Estelle acquainted with the message which James
                  Ely had, in his passion, sent to her, but she was very careful not to state what
                  drew such a message forth, for it is almost needless to say that Estelle had not
                  authorized her to address James in her behalf at all. The young girl's haughty and
                  vindictive nature was fully aroused when what her lover had said, with many
                  additions by Florence<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6405-00000041"/> rence, was laid
                  before her, and she declared she would never speak to him again. Both her sisters
                  made many excuses for the youth, but they were excuses of such a nature as to
                  strengthen, rather than weaken, Estelle's determination. Fanny averred that youth
                  was ever variable, and that James would, after basking for a moment in the smiles
                  of his new beauty, return to his first love, while Florence asserted that he
                  seemed half inclined to offer an apology for his conduct when she left him, and
                  was no doubt heartily sorry for what had occurred. These observations had the
                  effect which it was intended they should have. Estelle was filled with passionate
                  resentment, and in order to let James Ely see how little she heeded his love she
                  sought the society of Mr. Tieman, with whom, for the rest of the evening, she
                  danced and chatted delightedly, to all outward seeming, while a storm of grief and
                  indignation was raging in her deceived and lacerated heart.</p>
               <p>And so the night wore on, and when the company separated two hearts were blighted
                  that had beat high with hope and joy when it assembled.</p>
               <p>The next day when calm reflection had taken the place of the angry feelings which
                  had filled the hearts of Estelle and James Ely the night before, they both began
                  to think they had been too hasty. Estelle particularly began to imagine that there
                  might be some mistake in the matter which a mutual explanation would clear up.
                  Fanny, with a perfect knowledge of her sister's character, perceived this, and
                  trembling lest the lovers should resolve to address each other by letter, and thus
                  render null the pains which had been taken to separate them, determined upon a
                  master-stroke of policy, which was nothing less than that James Ely should hear
                  from Estelle's own lips that she did not love him and would not marry him under
                  any circumstances. Accordingly having fixed upon the course she intended to
                  pursue, she dispatched a short note to Ely, requesting him to call at the house at
                  six o'clock that evening. She stated that she intended to have some talk with
                  Estelle concerning their unhappy differences—she could not bear the idea of their
                  parting upon such slight grounds—it was a proceeding which they would both regret
                  as long as they lived—and she concluded by stating that she had no doubt a
                  reconciliation might be effected by a slight concession on both sides.</p>
               <p>James Ely was overjoyed upon receiving this note, for he could not endure the
                  thought of giving Estelle up forever, and he looked upon Fanny as the kindest of
                  women. He wondered how she could have altered so much in so short a time, and was
                  disposed to allow her the highest credit for warring against and eventually
                  conquering those disagreeable traits of character which he had at first noticed in
                  her.</p>
               <p>Punctual to the hour, at six o'clock he rang the bell at Mr. Grant's residence,
                  and was admitted to the parlor by the servant. Florence and Hollowell were both
                  from home, and Fanny, he was informed, was walking in the garden with Estelle, and
                  should be informed of his arrival.</p>
               <p>Although late in the Spring, it was a warm, sultry evening, and James Ely, taking
                  a book from the table, seated himself at an open window, and began looking over
                  its pages with a view of passing the time till Fanny should make her appearance.
                  Let us leave him reading and turn our attention to a conversation which at the
                  time was going on at the back of the house between Estelle and her sister
                  Fanny.</p>
               <p>'Florence tells me she saw James Ely not two hours since,' remarked Fanny, 'and
                  although she pressed him hard to call upon you and meet you half way in an attempt
                  at reconciliation he utterly refused to listen to her, and said that if any
                  apology was made it must come from you, and you alone.'</p>
               <p>'From me!' exclaimed Estelle, indignantly, 'from me! when he was the first to give
                  offence? Did he not urge me to retire from the ball-room, and then, as soon as my
                  back was turned, seek other company? and was I not justified in retaliating? And
                  now he looks to me for an apology! Should I stoop so low as to comply with his
                  unjust demand I should be the<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6405-00000042"/> mean
                  creature which he thinks me. No—much as a reconciliation would relieve my
                  overburdened heart, I will never seek one at the expense of my self-respect. I
                  will never humble myself before James Ely! Never! never! never! so help me
                  Heaven!'</p>
               <p>'I must admit,' said Fanny, 'that his wilful obstinacy has altered my feelings
                  towards him in a great degree, and were I in your place I would let him see that a
                  true woman's affections are not to be trifled with. Why don't you consent to
                  receive the visits of Philip Tieman? That would bring your recreant lover to his
                  senses if anything would.'</p>
               <p>'I cannot bring myself to play the trifler's part in my cool senses,' answered
                  Estelle; 'I detest trifling.'</p>
               <p>'Then why not receive his visits in good earnest?' enquired Fanny, 'and marry him
                  to revenge yourself?'</p>
               <p>The sisters were threading a little circular gravel walk that led completely
                  around the house, as they carried on their conversation, and when Fanny put the
                  last query to Estelle, which she did in an under tone, they stood directly beneath
                  the open window at which James Ely was sitting.</p>
               <p>'Because,' answered Estelle (and at the sound of her dearly cherished voice the
                  heart of James Ely beat tumultuously as he inclined his ear forward to listen,)
                  'because I do not love him.'</p>
               <p>'I am sure he loves you,' said Fanny 'and would marry you to-morrow if you would
                  have him.'</p>
               <p>'Perhaps so,' said Estelle, 'but should he lay the world at my feet, backed by
                  tears, and sighs, and protestations of eternal attachment, I would not marry him,
                  for I do not love him.'</p>
               <p>They passed on, and for a while James Ely sat like a statue, gazing fixedly on
                  vacancy. The last hope to which he had clung was dissipated—the day-star of his
                  existence had gone down in night—he had listened for the last time to the rich
                  tones of that voice which to him had ever been the most delightful lightful music,
                  and although it spoke his doom, there was a magic sweetness in it the recollection
                  of which he would carry with him ever—ever—ever! He had not heard Fanny's last
                  interrogatory to Estelle, but he had heard the answer which it drew forth, and it
                  was to him like the sentence of death pronounced by an angel. Suddenly rousing
                  himself from the spell that bound him, he seized his hat, and making his way out
                  unobserved, he gained his own premises and went to his room. Pulling open a
                  table-drawer, he took forth pen, ink, and paper, and hastily scratching a few
                  lines, he folded the sheet, directed it to his father, left it upon the table,
                  again rushed forth, and in two hours thereafter he was on his way to New Orleans
                  as fast as steam could carry him. The despicable conspiracy against the peace of
                  two youthful hearts was consummated at last—the lovers were parted—and the
                  conspirators were happy, but only for a season. Villany is sure, sooner or later,
                  to meet its reward, and the truth of the remark is fully borne out in what
                  follows.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <p>THE fact that James Ely had suddenly left St. Louis was not known to the Grants
                  for some days after his departure, and then they heard of it through one of the
                  domestics, who in her turn, had learned it from Capt. Ely's old housekeeper, who
                  imparted the information in a friendly confab through a crack in the fence
                  dividing the two yards. There were but two persons who particularly regretted the
                  young man's departure, and these were Estelle Grant and the old captain.—The
                  former clung to the hope of reconciliation as long as she knew James was near her;
                  but when he had departed, a settled melancholy took possession of her, and she
                  seldom spoke, even to her old nurse, except in answer to a question. The old
                  captain missed his son sadly, for he had been almost his only companion, and he
                  had fondly hoped to have had him with him at his last hour.</p>
               <p>Nor was it his loss alone that grieved him. He knew his son's wayward disposition,
                  and he was fearful that when abroad, without a cool and experienced head to
                  counsel him, he would abandon himself to despair, and dive recklessly into any
                  pursuit which might offer. The letter which James had left was calculated to
                  strengthen this apprehension. It was couched in language evincing the most
                  hopeless despondency on the part of the writer. He gave, in as few words as
                  possible sible, the details of his quarrel with Estelle, including the
                  conversation which he had overheard between her and Fanny—stated that he would not
                  have left his father under any other circumstances, but he could not bear the idea
                  of being so near Estelle, with the thought that she no longer loved him ever
                  uppermost in his mind, and concluded by stating that it was his intention to visit
                  New Orleans first, where, if he could obtain a clerkship on board a vessel bound
                  to foreign parts, he would ship, and endeavor in exile to forget his unhappy
                  passion and the object of it.</p>
               <p>The first perusal of the melancholy epistle gave the old seaman much pain, but he
                  possessed a good share of philosophy, and, at length, came to the conclusion that
                  grief was unavailing, and that his wisest plan was to bear his bereavement with
                  the best grace possible, and trust to Providence for the safety and future return
                  of his unhappy son. As far as Fanny, Florence, and old Mr. Grant were concerned,
                  they were exceedingly rejoiced that the youth had concluded to relieve them of his
                  presence, for with his disappearance vanished all danger of an <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">expose.</foreign> Fanny, indeed, had indulged a slight hope
                  that, in his despair, young Ely would blow out his brains or take a dose of
                  poison, but his sudden departure suited her about as well, for she had no fear
                  that he would ever return, at least as long as Estelle remained in the
                  neighborhood.</p>
               <p>The day for the marriage of Cornelius Hollowell with Florence had long been fixed,
                  and about one month subsequent, to the gathering at Mr. Tieman's mansion the
                  ceremony took place, with much display, at the house of the bride. Mr. Grant had
                  impoverished himself to get the affair off with <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >eclat.</foreign> He had drawn largely upon his friends, for he had no doubt
                  that, in a very short time, the liberality of his son-in law, who seeded a most
                  prodigal gentleman, would enable him to meet his liabilities. Hollowell, of
                  course, was making the same calculations on his father-in-law's bounty—so be<pb
                     n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6405-00000044"/> tween them it was a pretty even thing,
                  though, if there was any difference, Hollowell had rather the best of it.</p>
               <p>During the pressing calls for money which necessarily followed immediately upon
                  the heels of the wedding, the actual state of things could not possibly long
                  remain a secret. Mr. Grant needed money badly. He could scarcely turn a corner
                  without meeting a creditor, and unpaid bills kept pouring in upon him thick and
                  fast. He knew that he must call upon his son-in-law eventually—he had no other
                  resource. The ice must be broken sooner or later, and, after mature reflection, he
                  came to the conclusion that the sooner it was done the better. It was rather a
                  delicate affair for himself to broach, however, and he prevailed upon Florence, at
                  the earliest opportunity, to negociate a loan on his behalf.</p>
               <p>One evening about a week after Florence had become Mrs Hollowell, she sat by the
                  side of her husband in the drawing room, with one arm lovingly about his neck,
                  while with the other hand she was playing with his luxuriant and well oiled and
                  perfumed whiskers</p>
               <p>'How foolish our Estelle is,' she said, after a brief pause in a conversation, the
                  subject of which had of course been love, 'to pine and fret so after that beggarly
                  clerk, James Ely, who hadn't a farthing to call his own, except what he was
                  obliged to toil and drudge for.'</p>
               <p>'Very foolish—very foolish indeed,' replied Hollowell, affectedly; 'the fact of
                  the fellow's not having any money was not very objectionable if he had only been a
                  gentleman—but he wasn't; he was a poor, miserable wretch, the son of an old sea
                  monster that hadn't a genteel hair in his head.'</p>
               <p>'So horrid vulgar,' said Florence, 'it seemed to me as though I could smell tar
                  every time he came near me, and I do believe he brought the scent from home with
                  him.'</p>
               <p>'Very likely, my love, very likely,' replied Hollowell, laughing; a girl of
                  Estelle's breeding should be held inexcusable able for falling in love with any
                  such fellow as that, unless he was immensely rich, and even then it would hardly
                  pay.'</p>
               <p>'I think there should be a law passed to prevent such <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >canaille</foreign> from marrying into respectable families under any
                  circumstances,' said Florence, contemptuously, 'for I don't believe in marrying
                  for money, and it is utterly impossible that <emph>they</emph> should know what
                  love is—that is, refined love.'</p>
               <p>'Such as brought us together for example,' suggested Hollowell.</p>
               <p>'Exactly,' replied Florence; 'money is a very convenient thing, and it is
                  impossible to live without it, but I do not consider it necessary that both the
                  parties to a marriage should possess a fortune.'</p>
               <p>'How well our ideas concerning this important matter agree,' said Hollowell,
                  delightedly; 'you cannot imagine, sweet Florence, how your ingenuous sentiments
                  please me;' then drawing her close to him, and looking in her face with an arch
                  expression, he continued—'I'll let you into a secret, love!'</p>
               <p>'Yes, dear,' was the reply of Florence, who felt sure that he was about to
                  astonish her, by declaring the amount of his vast possessions. She calculated upon
                  half a million, at least.</p>
               <p>'It is such a good joke!' said Hollowell, apparently ready to explode with
                  laughter.</p>
               <p>'Yes, duck,' again repeated the expectant and highly excited Fanny—'go on.'</p>
               <p>'I know you'll laugh heartily at it,' snickered Hollowell.</p>
               <p>'Very likely, dear,' said Florence, beginning to grow impatient; 'but let me hear
                  it!'</p>
               <p>'Well, then,' said Hollowell, 'I was so certain I read your character correctly,
                  that I didn't think it worth while to inform you before marriage——' and again he
                  paused to indulge in a few premonitory symptoms of cachinatory explosion.</p>
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6405-00000045"/>
               <p>'Yes, love,' repeated Florence for the fourth time, and her anxiety had now
                  reached an almost painful pitch.</p>
               <p>'That I hadn't a cent in the world!' said Hollowell—and having at length succeeded
                  in getting off the 'good joke,' he gave the fit of laughter which he had been all
                  along smothering, free vent.</p>
               <p>'O, no, no, no!' cried Florence, distractedly, after she had regained the power of
                  speech, of which the sudden terrible announcement had deprived her, 'you don't
                  mean that—you are playing with me to try me—is it not so?'</p>
               <p>'Mean it!' said Hollowell, alarmed at the alteration in his wife's demeanor, and
                  in his turn growing serious; 'mean it? To be sure I do! What then? Didn't you just
                  say that it was only necessary one of the parties to a marriage should possess
                  wealth?'</p>
               <p>'O, lost, lost! Duped! ruined!' cried Florence, bursting into an agony of tears,
                  wringing her hands, and pacing frantically up and down the room.</p>
               <p>'Why, you don't mean to say that you——that is, that your father is not rich—not
                  worth two hundred thousand dollars?'</p>
               <p>'Begone, sir!' cried Florence, in a voice of thunder, suddenly checking herself in
                  her mad career, and looking daggers at the man she had chosen for her liege lord,
                  'begone, sir, and never let me see your hateful face again!'</p>
               <p>Wait a bit,' said Hollowell, with imperturbable coolness 'if it comes to that, I
                  believe the law invests me with some authority here, which I shall make bold to
                  exercise if you don't observe a more respectful demeanor. Present appearances
                  would seem to indicate that I have made a very sad mistake, and although I
                  sympathise deeply with you, I can't at the same time keep from thinking that I
                  have been most egregiously swindled. However, I am willing to compromise the
                  matter reasonably—get the old boy to give me a thousand, and you shall never lay
                  eyes on me again.'</p>
               <p>Florence could only sob hysterically.</p>
               <p>'What, no answer to so reasonable a proposition?' exclaimed Hollowell,
                  deprecatingly, 'well, then, say eight hundred, and that's the very lowest figure.
                  You will be willing to give double that after having lived with me a week, so you
                  had better close with me at once.'</p>
               <p>'Detestable, black-hearted brute!' Florence managed to articulate, and then
                  rushing suddenly from the room she sought the presence of her father.</p>
               <p>As soon as he found himself alone, Hollowell dropped into a chair, and uttered a
                  prolonged whistle—this was followed by a deep-drawn sigh, and then he muttered to
                  himself, 'I'm <emph>sold,</emph> that's evident, and if anybody had made the
                  assertion two months ago that such a thing was possible, I should have laughed at
                  it. Was Emory mistaken when he told me the amount of the old man's wealth, or did
                  he gull me purposely? The latter, I'll bet my life. But he didn't get so much the
                  better of me after all. I'm a thousand ahead of him yet, and if I know myself,
                  I'll keep my advantage. I wonder what old Grant 'll say when his daughter informs
                  him she has drawn a blank? It is quite evident now that he was an interested party
                  in the affair, and I have no doubt he'll storm terribly. Well, let him. His
                  storming will do no good—I have him on the hip—his daughter is my wife, and if I
                  am forced to leave here, she must leave with me. Not that I wish her company. O,
                  no, on the contrary, I must get rid of her, but not till I have made something by
                  the speculation. This is the fourth time I have tried the same dodge in different
                  parts of the Union, and I have never failed yet to realize something.'</p>
               <p>While Hollowell was thus communing with himself, a quick tread was heard in the
                  entry, the door opened suddenly, and the old merchant stood before him. His
                  aspect, always stern and forbidding, was now truly frightful to behold. The large
                  veins upon his temple were swelled almost to bursting by the hot blood which anger
                  had forced into them, his thin lips twitched nervously with suppressed rage, and
                  his savage eyes<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6405-00000046"/> sparkled with the fire of
                  hate, as he glared furiously upon the object of his wrath.</p>
               <p>Hollowell was not at all disconcerted, but met the fixed gaze of his father-in-law
                  with an air of the most perfect indifference, and merely throwing one leg over the
                  other, and settling himself comfortably in his seat, he said, in a tone of
                  self-possessed assurance—</p>
               <p>'Rather a disagreeable matter, this, eh, old fel.? Unlooked-for, wasn't it? So it
                  was to me. Take a seat, and make yourself comfortable. Let's talk the matter over
                  pleasantly, and I've no doubt we shall succeed in coming to some satisfactory
                  arrangement. I ain't a hard man to deal with.'</p>
               <p>'Leave this room immediately,' said the old man, in a voice of stern command, at
                  the same time pointing towards the door.</p>
               <p>'Certainly, if you wish it,' replied Hollowell, in the most affable tone
                  imaginable. 'Is my wife ready to accompany me?'</p>
               <p>'Detestable wretch!' roared the old man, now losing all command of himself.
                  'Begone, at once, if you would not have me murder you! And he advanced a step, as
                  if with the purpose of forcibly ejecting the object of his ire.</p>
               <p>'One moment—one moment, <emph>if you please!'</emph> said Hollowell, persuasively.
                  'Just think this matter over a bit before you do anything rash. We have humbugged
                  each other—there can be no question about that—but, under the circumstances, would
                  you not be acting a wiser part to compromise the affair than to have the story get
                  all over St. Louis? If you eject me, of course people will think it strange, and I
                  shall be obliged, in self-defence, to make the whole matter public, for I cannot
                  afford to lose my standing in society. On the other hand, all I require from you
                  is, that you furnish me with money enough—say a thousand dollars—to pay my
                  travelling expenses to some distant part of the Union, and then the story can go
                  abroad that I have started on a business tour, and I will never trouble you again.
                  If you are very short, and cannot raise the required sum at once, I am in no
                  particular hurry—I can remain here till you do get it, and things can go on as
                  usual. Don't you see how much better this would be?'</p>
               <p>'O, villain! villain—heartless, despicable villain!' groaned the wretched old man,
                  as he sank into a chair, and, unable longer to control himself, wept like a
                  child.</p>
               <p>'I don't know that there is much to choose between us,' said Hollowell,
                  provokingly. 'We were playing for a stake, and I managed to get a point the best
                  of the game—that's about the true state of the case, as I view it, and I don't see
                  why <emph>you</emph> should grumble if <emph>I</emph> don't.'</p>
               <p>'Hark you!' said the old merchant, suddenly rising to his feet, 'you have me
                  slightly in your power, and you feel your advantage, but do not presume too much
                  upon it. I agree to the terms proposed by you, conditionally. You may stay here
                  till I am prepared to send you off, but, in the interval, I require that you shall
                  not even look at, much less speak to, either of my daughters or myself. If you do
                  not feel disposed to agree to this, be gone instantly, and make public what you
                  think proper. Your answer, sir!' And he stood scowlingly awaiting the reply.</p>
               <p>'Rather hard terms,' said Hollowell, after a moment's reflection, 'but I suppose I
                  can't do better than accept them. I am always willing to accommodate, and so it's
                  a bargain.'</p>
               <p>'Enough!' said the old man, from whose face every appearance of grief had now
                  vanished; and, drawing himself up to his full height, with a contemptuous curl of
                  his lip, he strode out of the apartment.</p>
               <p>A month rolled gloomily by, after the marriage of Hollowell and Florence—a month
                  of indescribable wretchedness to the members of the Grant family—when suddenly the
                  portentous cloud which had so long hovered over the house of Durand, Emory, Grant
                  &amp; Co., burst in its fury, and the firm was declared bankrupt. Certain
                  outstanding notes were protested,<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6405-00000047"/> and the
                  concern was obliged to wind up. It was a severe blow to the old merchant, although
                  he had for sometime anticipated it, for he was utterly ruined, and knew not which
                  way to turn. His partners were more fortunate than himself, for they had something
                  to fall back upon; they were shrewder business men, and knew better than to risk
                  their all in any enterprise. Emory's name had never been erased from the books of
                  the concern, and Mr. Grant, of course, supposed him to be yet a partner. He had no
                  reason to think otherwise, for that individual had been regularly consulted in
                  every important matter relating to the business of the house, and was in constant
                  correspondence with the firm. Immediately, therefore, upon the abrupt termination
                  of the business affairs of the establishment, a full statement of the case, duly
                  certified, was sent to Emory, and this was accompanied by a private letter from
                  Mr. Grant, giving a full account of his domestic troubles, revealing the true
                  state of his finances, and asking advice and assistance in his dreadful
                  extremity.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <p>IT is, perhaps, unnecessary to inform the reader that Everard Emory was perfectly
                  well acquainted with all the facts relating to the failure of the concern in which
                  he was supposed to be a partner, long before he received any intelligence thereof
                  from St. Louis—and furthermore that it was through his instrumentality the result
                  had been so suddenly brought about. There was nothing in Mr. Grant's letter,
                  therefore, to surprise him, save the fact that Cornelius Hollowell had turned out
                  to be a penniless adventurer—one of that numerous class who live entirely by their
                  wits. This did indeed astonish him, and not only did it astonish him but it filled
                  him with vexation and disquietude. He had always flattered himself that he
                  possessed a perfect knowledge of human nature—an intuitive perception of character
                  which would enable him to tell his man at a glance—and the idea that he could so
                  easily be deceived lowered him somewhat in his own estimation. Nor was this
                  all—the recollection of the promissory note transaction at once came up in his
                  mind, and he began to fear that he had been swindled as well as misled. Having
                  arrived at this conclusion in his own mind, he determined with all possible
                  despatch to ascertain whether his apprehensions were well founded or not,<pb
                     n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6405-00000048"/> and with this view he hastened to answer
                  the bankrupt merchant's letter.</p>
               <p>He commenced his epistle by sympathizing with Mr. Grant in his misfortunes, and at
                  the same time, with well-feigned sorrow, blaming himself for having been, though
                  innocently, the cause of a portion of his trouble. He stated that he would
                  willingly have borne his own losses, if his friend could have-escaped, and that he
                  would do everything in his power to assist him in regaining his fallen fortunes.
                  'Business,' he wrote, 'is rather dull at present in New York, but there is every
                  prospect of a brisk season when the fall trade opens. I have entirely abandoned
                  mercantile pursuits myself, and devote my attention exclusively to real estate and
                  railroad stocks, but this need not prevent my looking out for you. If I might
                  advise, you would do well to settle up your affairs at once, and remove with your
                  family to ——, where I am at present residing. Here you can stay during the summer
                  months, and in the Fall, if anything favorable in the way of business offers, you
                  may command both my purse and my influence. I feel that as I was mainly
                  instrumental in causing you to embark in a speculation which has swallowed up your
                  capital, I should in some way assist you to regain it, and if you think favorably
                  of my proposition, drop me a line immediately on the receipt of this letter, and I
                  will secure you a house near to my own of which you may take immediate
                  possession.' After some further hypocritical expressions of regret and condolence,
                  he went on to speak of Hollowell. He did not exactly like him, but never doubted
                  that he was what he represented himself to be. 'Since you have enlightened me
                  regarding him,' ran his letter, 'I am fearful that you and your daughter are not
                  the only persons who have suffered from his dishonesty. I begin to suspect him of
                  having in his dealings with me committed a crime which will bring him within the
                  grasp of the law.' He then detailed the particulars concerning the promissory
                  note, a duplicate of which be inclosed, and requested Mr. Grant to call upon the
                  parties concerned and ascertain if any such paper had passed through their hands.
                  'If it should prove to be all correct,' he wrote, 'well and good—but if the note
                  is fraudulent he shall go to the State Prison as surely as he is a living man, if
                  money and a close attention to the matter can send him there. In either case you
                  will oblige me by not saying anything to him on the subject, but advise me as
                  speedily as possible.'</p>
               <p>When Mr. Grant received this letter he was sitting alone in the drawing-room of
                  his residence, in no very pleasant frame of mind—he having just terminated a very
                  disagreeable interview with his graceless son-in-law, who had called upon him to
                  know when he would be likely to have the sum agreed upon between them as the price
                  of departure, ready. The fact is, Hollowell began to think, after the old
                  gentleman's failure, that he had, for once in his life, made a bargain which was
                  likely to prove profitless, and in his fear of such a result he had, in the
                  interview above alluded to, abated his original demand of a thousand dollars
                  one-half. 'I'll tell you what I'll do with you, Governor,' was the last thing he
                  had said, in his admirably cool, business-like manner, 'seeing it's you, and
                  taking into consideration the fact that you've had rather hard luck lately, I'll
                  split the difference and take five hundred, provided the money is forthcoming this
                  afternoon.' The old gentleman had dismissed him with a growl and an imprecation,
                  and sat brooding over his troubles when Emory's letter was put into his hand.</p>
               <p>He broke the seal and an expression of satisfaction passed over his haggard
                  countenance as he perused the proposition made by Emory. The thing of all others
                  that he wished most to do was to leave St. Louis, and here was an opportunity of
                  so favorable a stamp as to exceed his most sanguine expectations. The further he
                  read the better he seemed pleased, till he reached that portion of the epistle
                  which alluded to the impudent trickster who had just left him, and then an
                     expression<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6405-00000049"/> sion of mingled
                  apprehension, hate and triumph rested upon his face. When he had finished, he
                  folded the letter up and placing it carefully in his pocket, he muttered—</p>
               <p>'So, so!—my worthy son-in law, among his other accomplishments, without a doubt,
                  possesses the art of counterfeiting! Under the circumstances, I am rejoiced that I
                  have made the discovery, for, although I cannot act in the premises just as I
                  should wish to, on account of his connection with my family, the knowledge of his
                  guilt will render it easy for me to send him off at once. It is unnecessary that I
                  should prosecute any enquiries concerning this note. I feel satisfied that it is a
                  rank forgery, and shall act upon the supposition alone. It would gratify me
                  exceedingly to have the impudent scoundrel thrown into a dungeon, but I cannot
                  accomplish this without exposing myself, and rendering my daughter ridiculous.
                  Emory will, perhaps, be incensed against me if I allow the forger to escape, but I
                  must do so even at the risk of his displeasure, for I cannot consent, while bowed
                  to the earth with pecuniary misfortunes, to become the public's laughing stock as
                  well.'</p>
               <p>Rising from his seat, he rang a bell, which having been answered, he directed that
                  Hollowell should be sent to him. He then reseated himself, and shortly afterwards
                  his son-in-law, in his habitual free-and-easy manner, made his appearance.</p>
               <p>'Ah, Governor!' he exclaimed, in a tone of affected cordiality, as he deliberately
                  drew up a chair and gracefully seated himself in front of the old man, 'I didn't
                  anticipate the pleasure of having another interview with you so soon. Reconsidered
                  the matter, eh? Made up your mind to raise the cash at once on account of the
                  liberal discount which I made, eh? Going to start me off, right away, eh?'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' answered the old gentleman, in a tone of such evident satisfaction as to
                  somewhat astonish Hollowell, who had left him only a few moments previously, in a
                  towering passion, 'I have but this moment come into possession of means which will
                  enable me to settle with you immediately, and I have decided that you shall start
                  upon your <emph>business tour</emph> this very day.'</p>
               <p>'I am rejoiced to hear it,' answered Hollowell, rubbing his hands gleefully, 'for
                  to tell you the truth I am tired of this locality. I am naturally, as you may have
                  observed, of an active, business turn, and excitement is as necessary to my
                  existence as water is to a fish's. I am positively dying of <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">ennui,</foreign> and the sooner I encounter new scenes and new
                  faces the better it will suit me. For yourself, when I am gone, don't let the
                  recollection of our brief, but rather intimate, acquaintance give you any
                  uneasiness, for, unless the blind goddess should hereafter prove over-bountiful in
                  the bestowal of her gifts upon you, it is not at all likely <emph>we</emph> shall
                  ever meet again. If you do, however, at any future time come into the possession
                  of more money than you have use for, and the knowledge of the fact reaches me, I
                  may, if I am particularly short, call upon you for the remaining five hundred.
                  Oblige me by saying as much to my dear wife, and now, if you please, I will take
                  my leave.'</p>
               <p>'That is precisely what I want you to do instantly,' remarked Mr. Grant,
                  quietly.</p>
               <p>'Then pass over the 'collateral,'' said Hollowell, at the same time holding out
                  his hand and agitating his digits—an action expressive of his desire to finger the
                  money—'Pass over the 'collateral' and I'm off.'</p>
               <p>'Before you start,' remarked the old merchant, in a significant tone, 'allow me to
                  enquire if it makes any material difference to you which direction you take upon
                  leaving here?'</p>
               <p>'Not the slightest,' was Hollowell's ready, off-hand reply, 'North, East, South,
                  or West, it's all the same to me—I am a perfect cosmopolite—but why do you
                  ask?'</p>
               <p>'I didn't know but what I could get you to transact a little business for me in
                  New York,' said Mr. Grant.</p>
               <p>'Certainly—with the greatest pleasure,' replied Hollowell,<pb n="98-99"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000050"/> who, notwithstanding he managed to preserve his
                  imperturbable demeanor, began to feel very uneasy in view of the calm,
                  self-possession evinced by his father in-law, who was usually so turbulent and
                  boisterous when conversing with him—'what is the nature of the business?'</p>
               <p>'I merely wish you,' said Mr. Grant, fixing his eyes full upon those of Hollowell,
                  and assuming a truly stern look, 'to be the bearer of a letter from myself to one
                  Everard Emory. It contains the intelligence that a certain promissory note for a
                  thousand dollars of which he is in possession, has, upon enquiry, turned out to be
                  a forgery.'</p>
               <p>A death-like pallor crept over the features of the conscience-stricken Hollowell,
                  his air of mock-suavity and bravado, instantly changed to one of cringing
                  servility, and the cold sweat stood in large beads upon his forehead, as he
                  quailed beneath the basalisk-like gaze which was fixed upon him.</p>
               <p>'What! do you hesitate,' continued the old merchant, in a tone of sarcasm, 'to do
                  me so slight a favor? you are not the friend I took you to be! But aside from your
                  friendship for me, your own credit demands that you should be the bearer of my
                  letter to Mr. Emory, for the individual who is supposed to have forged the note in
                  question made use of your name. You owe it to yourself, therefore, to explain away
                  any doubts which may arise as to sully your fair fame.'</p>
               <p>"Spare me!' said the now-alarmed swindler, falling at the old man's feet, and
                  clasping his knee—'spare me, for the love of God! Don't have me arrested! I never
                  was in prison, and it would cause my death!'</p>
               <p>'What! you don't mean to say that you are the guilty person!' cried the old man,
                  tauntingly—'you, who, in self-defence, and to preserve your <emph>standing in
                     society,</emph> would be obliged to make public the particulars of, your
                  marriage, if ejected from my house! <emph>You</emph> guilty of so heinous a crime
                  as forgery! Impossible! I can't believe it!'</p>
               <p>'Mercy! mercy was all that the poor wretch who grovelled at his feet, could
                  utter.</p>
               <p>'How about five hundred dollars <emph>now?'</emph> continued the old man, with a
                  fiendish chuckle, 'I suppose you would willingly give me a receipt in full of all
                  demands, <emph>seeing that it is me,</emph> and say no more about it—is it not
                  so?'</p>
               <p>'I will do anything which you demand,' was the reply, 'so that you will not have
                  me arrested.'</p>
               <p>'Poor, pitiful villain!' cried the old man, suddenly changing his tone of quiet,
                  biting sarcasm to one of relentless hate, dearly shall you pay now for the bitter
                  tears you have wrung from me, and the indignities you have heaped upon me! you
                  shall starve, toil, suffer and rot in prison!'</p>
               <p>A look full of deep and deadly vengeance settled upon the gloomy brow of
                  Hollowell, as he raised himself from his prostrate position, and stood erect
                  before his tormentor. The old merchant did not mean what he said—he did not wish
                  to send his son-in-law to prison, for reasons with which the reader is already
                  acquainted, but it delighted him to witness his throes of agony, and therefore he
                  threatened him. Hollowell, however, fully believed that the old man would be as
                  good as his word, and having exhausted all his entreaties, he determined to pursue
                  another course of action.</p>
               <p>'Then nothing short of my incarceration within the walls of a prison will satisfy
                  you,' he said, in a voice husky with passionate emotion.</p>
               <p>'Nothing!' exclaimed the old man, violently—'nothing! You shall, for once in your
                  life, know what it is to labor—you shall groan under heavy burdens with a
                  task-master at your back, feed on prison fare, and repose your delicate limbs on a
                  pallet of straw; you shall be pushed from post to pillar; subject to the tyranny
                  of a keeper; a thing to scoff at and to beat; the most contemptible of all
                  objects—a miserable felon! And I shall see it all—I shall come occasionally to
                  look at you, for<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6405-00000051"/> I am curious to know
                  what effect such treatment will have upon a man of such high standing in
                  society.'</p>
               <p>The old man paused to see what effect his language would produce upon his
                  listener, but scarcely had the last word left his lips, when Hollowell, with the
                  bound of an infuriated tiger, sprang upon his throat.</p>
               <p>'You shall never live to witness such a gratifying sight!' he hissed between his
                  set teeth, and then commenced a desperate struggle for life or death. Mr. Grant,
                  although the weight of years was upon his head, was a powerfully-built man, and
                  possessed great muscular strength. Hollowell, on the contrary, was slightly-built
                  and rather weak, although he possessed the advantage of youth, and was more agile
                  and wiry than the merchant. His object was to secure a firm hold of the old man's
                  ample cravat, and to choke him to death by twisting it, before he could give the
                  alarm. He was successful in making-good his grasp, but before he could succeed in
                  suffocating the old merchant sufficiently to weaken him, the latter, by a
                  determined effort, broke his hold, and was about bearing him to the floor by main
                  strength, when Hollowell, by a dexterous twist of his body, jerked clear from him,
                  and retreating a few paces, pulled from the inside pocket of his coat a small
                  pistol, and fired. At the same instant, Mrs. Dunscomb, who had been alarmed by the
                  scuffle while passing the door, entered the room, and the ball from the pistol,
                  which flew clear of its intended victim, went crashing into her skull, and without
                  groan she sank upon the floor, a corpse. Clearing the room at a bound, Hollowell
                  gained the street, and made good his escape, leaving the old merchant transfixed
                  with horror at the spectacle before him.</p>
               <p>By this time not only was the entire household fully aroused, but people came
                  pouring in from the street to learn the cause of the tumult, and many were the
                  expressions of consternation which fell from the lips of the assemblage as they
                  gazed upon the features of the murdered woman. 'Who shot her?'— 'What did he do it
                  for?'—'Has he escaped?'—and a thousand other interrogatories of a like nature,
                  were heard among the excited multitude both inside and outside of the merchant's
                  dwelling, till at length the Coroner, who had been notified, made his appearance,
                  empanelled a jury, and proceeded in due form to investigate the melancholy
                  transaction. There was no witness to the bloody deed save the old merchant
                  himself, and when placed upon the stand to testify, he determined, in order to
                  avoid the exposure of his family affairs which must necessarily follow a true
                  statement of the case, to manufacture a story which would pass current, and at the
                  same time obviate the necessity of his revealing what he wished to keep to
                  himself. Acccordingly, he stated that upon entering his drawing-room suddenly, he
                  had detected a man in the act of robbery—that he had attempted to arrest him, when
                  a struggle ensued, in the course of which the robber discharged a pistol, the
                  bullet from which missed him and took effect in the head of the housekeeper, who
                  entered the room just at the time the shot was fired, doubtless drawn to the scene
                  by the noise of the scuffle. His testimony was clear and straightforward. It was,
                  moreover, fully sustained by the evidence of other witnesses. A number of persons
                  had seen a man emerge hurriedly from the house, and rush off up the street, but he
                  appeared and disappeared so suddenly that it was impossible for them to note his
                  general appearance even, much less to scrutinize his features. The jury,
                  therefore, could only find that the unfortunate deceased had met her death at the
                  hands of some unknown person, and thus the affair was summarily disposed of.</p>
               <p>The sudden and awful death of the good old woman was a terrible blow to Estelle,
                  who now felt that she was, indeed, alone in the world, for since the flight of her
                  lover her sisters had resumed all their former ill-treatment of her. Fanny and
                  Florence were only shocked at the circumstance—not grieved. They, of course,
                  thought it necessary to swoon at the sight of<pb n="102-103"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000052"/> blood when the melancholy spectacle first met their
                  eyes—this was due their characters as young ladies of approved refinement and
                  delicate nerves; but, after the excitement consequent upon the holding of a
                  coroner's inquest in the house had passed over, and the body of the unfortunate
                  deceased had been prepared for burial, they only regretted that the thing should
                  have happened when money was so scarce and carriage hire so expensive, and
                  wondered what disagreeable circumstance would happen next to excite their
                  shattered nerves. While they were thus heartlessly complaining in the
                  drawing-room, their sorrow-crushed younger sister was lamenting over the corpse of
                  her dearly-prized foster-mother in another part of the house. The bereavement
                  seemed the more dreadful to the poor girl because it was so sudden. But a few
                  short hours previously the form which now lay cold and inanimate before her, had
                  enfolded her in its warm embrace, and the tongue now mut had whispered words of
                  hope and consolation to her despairing heart—but whose bosom should she nestle in
                  now?—whose tongue, in accents of unspeakable tenderness, should bid her live on,
                  love on, hope on, and trust in Heaven? 'O, why am I thus left alone!' she cried,
                  in her agony, as she gazed upon the placid features of the dead—'Would that I,
                  too, could die!'</p>
               <p>Poor child! She lacked that philosophy without which life, under the most
                  favorable auspices, must be burdensome—she could not find a soothing balm for her
                  heart in the teaching that her loss was her darling foster-mother's gain—she could
                  not recognize the truth of that doctrine which makes <q>
                     <l>"All partial evil, universal good."</l>
                  </q> No, she was a creature of extremes—whatever passion predominated in her when
                  excited, for the time being swallowed up every other—her love, and her hate, her
                  joy and her sorrow were alike limitless, but they could not by gently mingling,
                  soften and render each other tractable. They operated singly, and independent of
                  each other. There was but one avenue by which her interior sensations could make
                  themselves visible to the outward eye, and this admitted but one passion at a
                  time. It would have been fortunate for Estelle had her nature been different—she
                  could then better have sustained the trying part which in the drama of life had
                  been allotted to her. While Mrs. Dunscomb was living the child had striven with
                  all her might to gain the mastery over herself, because she was constantly taught
                  to do so, but all her resolves to this end perished with the being who had called
                  them forth, and when she saw her preceptress laid in the grave she did not even
                  try to control herself, but gave way to the most ungovernable grief.</p>
               <p>It was not until two weeks after the funeral of Mrs. Dunscomb had taken place that
                  Mr. Grant made his daughters acquainted with the fact that Hollowell was both a
                  forger and a murderer. When he did so, Florence came near fainting again, but
                  altered her mind when it occurred to her that there was nobody present to catch
                  her, and contented herself with exclaiming hysterically, 'The monster! O, that I
                  should have married such a wretch!' Fanny merely gave expression to a prolonged
                  'O-o-o-o!' but Estelle fixed her passionate black eyes upon her father with a
                  searching gaze, and demanded to know why he had not proclaimed the villain's
                  name?</p>
               <p>Because I did not wish to expose myself,' was the reply.</p>
               <p>'Father!' cried the young girl, angrily, 'had anybody but yourself told of this I
                  should have charged them with falsehood. What! because one of your daughters was
                  unfortunate enough to marry a scoundrel, are you to allow him to commit murder
                  with impunity beneath your own roof? Is it just that you should suffer him to
                  escape through the fear of exposing some foible of your own by denouncing him? If
                  this is <emph>your</emph> idea of right it is not <emph>mine,</emph> and I am
                  determined that his name shall be exposed.'</p>
               <p>'Why, Estelle!' exclaimed the merchant in a tone of alarm,<pb n="104-105"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000053"/> 'what do you mean, my child? You would not have
                  your old father thrown into prison, would you? By pursuing the course which I did,
                  I have made myself amenable to the law, and should the fact get abroad my arrest
                  would follow immediately.'</p>
               <p>'I did not think of that," replied Estelle, 'and for the present he is safe, but
                  the day may come when I shall be under no restriction, and if I can reach him
                  then, dearly shall he answer for the murder of one of the best and purest women
                  that ever lived!'</p>
               <p>'Dear me, how indignant!' tittered Fanny.</p>
               <p>'Quite a savage, I declare!' exclaimed Florence.</p>
               <p>'It is a pity,' quietly said Estelle, turning her eyes upon the last speaker,
                  'that you do not possess a portion of that blunt honesty which belongs to the
                  character of the savage—in that case you would never have called the object of my
                  indignation, husband.'</p>
               <p>The blood rushed into the face of Florence at this allusion to her unfortunate
                  marriage, and she was about to retort sharply, when Mr. Grant interfered and put
                  an end to the dispute. He then informed his daughters of the offer which had been
                  made him by Everard Emory, and told them that he had dispatched an answer
                  accepting it. This announcement gave the greatest satisfaction to all concerned;
                  Fanny and Florence, in particular, were delighted with it, for since their
                  father's failure they had been ashamed to look an acquaintance in the face, and
                  the wish uppermost in their hearts was to get away from St. Louis. Even Estelle,
                  although deeply attached to the home of her early associations, was now anxious to
                  leave it. It had seemed lonely enough after James Ely's departure, but it was
                  doubly desolate after the death of her foster mother, and she felt as though a
                  change of scene would be a relief to her. It was not long before the wishes of all
                  were gratified, for in two weeks after Mr. Grant had notified them of his
                  intention to change his location, he and his family were safely domiciled
                  in—mdash;, under the care and patronage of Everard Emory.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <p>ONE night, about a month after the events just narrated, among a crowd of
                  fashionably-dressed youths who had assembled in one of the brilliantly-lighted
                  Broadway saloons in New York, devoted exclusively to the fascinating amusement of
                  billiards, might have been seen two young men who had chosen a table apart from
                  the rest, and were apparently as deeply interested in the conversation which was
                  going on between them, as in the game they were playing. One of them was Robert
                  Barker, the youth whom Helen had heard familiarly addressed as Bob while she was
                  peeping through the keyhole of the infamous house into which she had been
                  inveigled, and the other was Samuel Slocumb, his bosom friend, and the companion
                  of his nocturnal rounds. Both were young men of high respectability—that is, they
                  both had rich fathers who allowed them an unlimited supply of pocket money, and
                  did not think it worth while to enquire in what manner the same was expended. It
                  is true they were aware that their sons were absent from home sometimes for a week
                  on a stretch, without extending their peregrinations beyond the limits of
                  Manhattan Island, but then they argued, 'Boys will be boys, and there is no use in
                  trying to put old heads on young shoulders—let them have their way, and they will
                  soon grow tired of roving around, and settle down into quiet, staid sober
                  citizens.' With such a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">carte blanche</foreign> as this
                  extended to<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6405-00000054"/> them, it would have been
                  wonderful if the youths in question had not made up their minds to live as 'fast'
                  as possible, and accordingly they devoted their attention to but one study, and
                  that was the study of what is commonly, but erroneously termed pleasure. During
                  the winter months, New York offered sufficient attraction for them, but in the
                  summer season their time was divided between Newport, Saratoga, and other
                  fashionable resorts of a lesser note. On the morning preceding the night of their
                  introduction to the reader, they had just returned from a visit to ——, where
                  Emory's summer residence was situated, and where they had seen sufficient to
                  furnish them with matter for some little conversation, although they had not met
                  with attraction strong enough to keep them there.</p>
               <p>'I say, Sam,' said Robert Barker, as he chalked the end of his queue, preparatory
                  to trying a difficult <foreign xml:lang="FRA">caram,</foreign> 'that Estelle Grant
                  is rather a fascinating specimen of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">de
                  laine</foreign>—ain't she?'</p>
               <p>'Passable,' answered Sam, 'only passable—she has a pretty figure, and her features
                  are well enough, all but her eyes—but I don't like her neyes—there's too much of
                  the devil in them to suit me.'</p>
               <p>'That's just what I admire most!' exclaimed Bob; 'spirited! none of your
                  faint-away milk-and-water damsels, but a real 2:40 institution when she's started,
                  or you can shoot me! By the way, do you know that Harry —— is head over heels in
                  love with her?'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' replied Sam Slocumb, 'I believe he is looking rather anxiously in that
                  direction, but he's barking up the wrong tree, and might as well give it up. That
                  sanctimonious old dodger, Emory, has made up his mind to marry her, and when he
                  determines upon anything it's as good as accomplished.'</p>
               <p>'You don't suppose she'd marry him, do you?' said Bob, striking his ball so
                  vigorously as to make it bounce again.</p>
               <p>'Well, I don't hardly think she would, <emph>from choice,'</emph> was the
                  reply—'but between you and me, I don't believe she can avoid it.'</p>
               <p>'What do you mean?' said Bob, stopping short in his play and gazing enquiringly at
                  his friend.</p>
               <p>'I'll tell you,' said Sam Slocum—'you know I'm rather fond of being posted up in
                  all affairs of this kind, especially if there's any mystery in the case—so I got
                  into conversation with the 'Biddy' who officiates at Grant's, as she was sweeping
                  off the walk a morning or two before we left, and by dint of crossing her palm
                  with silver, I learned that Emory had complete possession of the whole party, and
                  could turn them whichever way he pleased.'</p>
               <p>'Did she tell you <emph>why</emph> he had such power over them?' asked Bob.</p>
               <p>'No,' was the reply, 'she couldn't—she went up from New York to take the situation
                  there, and knew very little about the Grants, but she was terribly down on Emory,
                  whom she called a 'murdherin' ould haythen,' and made some allusion to his having
                  injured her years ago. 'They minds him as well,' she said, 'as meself minds the
                  praste, and sorra the wan way they'll go, only the way he tells thim. It's well I
                  know the poor girl'll have to marry him, but it's meself that would rather marry
                  the divil than the likes of him.'</p>
               <p>'That Emory <emph>is</emph> a devilish queer sort of customer,' said Bob—'every
                  thing he touches turns to gold, and he never has transactions with anybody but
                  what he seemingly gets them entirely in his power.'</p>
               <p>'It would be a good idea to go up there when the marriage comes off and witness
                  the ceremony, wouldn't it? asked Sam.</p>
               <p>'Yes,' answered his companion, 'I don't know but what it would, though I must
                  admit it will seem rather hard to see such a crusty old customer bear off so fair
                  a prize.'</p>
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6405-00000055"/>
               <p>By this time the brace of hopefuls had finished their game, and having settled
                  with the marker, they sallied forth, and started on their usual nightly ramble
                  about the city.</p>
               <p>The facts which the inquisitive Sam Slocumb had managed to draw from the Irish
                  servant girl, Kate O'Donnell, were known to many persons in —— although not openly
                  talked about. The persons composing the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coterie</foreign>
                  in which Everard Emory moved did not consider themselves justified in too closely
                  scanning the acts of a gentleman possessing such unbounded wealth, and bearing so
                  spotless a character as did the smooth-faced deacon, and although they
                     <emph>would</emph> wonder among themselves how it was that Estelle Grant, whose
                  youth and rare beauty had won for her scores of admirers, among young men of
                  fashion and respectability, could satisfy herself with the exclusive attention of
                  a person so much her senior in years, and so different from herself in general
                  characteristics—although they would sometimes venture to whisper that it was
                  strange that Mr. Grant—evidently self-willed and fond of power—should have no
                  voice in the government of his own affairs—still they never allowed their surmises
                  to take the shape of free speech, for they would not have offended their
                  saint-like neighbor for the world.</p>
               <p>To tell the truth, the old merchant himself did not know how Emory had contrived
                  to so completely deprive him of all authority over his own household. It was true
                  he was the deacon's debtor, but no threats had thus far been used—no coercion
                  attempted. On the contrary, Emory was extremely bland, affable and courteous—he
                  never <emph>ordered</emph> that anything should be done—he merely
                     <emph>suggested,</emph> but in such a way that Mr. Grant, though ever so much
                  inclined, found it utterly impossible to go contrary to his wishes. He was a
                  captive with his prison door wide open—a dictator without the power of speech. He
                  was under the influence of a spell while in the presence of the hypocrite which he
                  endeavored in vain to break. He was not the man, however, that he had been. Grief
                  and trouble had made sad inroads upon a naturally vigorous constitution— <q>
                     <l>"Sharp misery had worn him to the bone,</l>
                  </q> and his mind suffered with his body. He was more peevish and fretful, if
                  possible, than formerly, but less positive—his disposition to control remained,
                  but his firmness had fled, and when Emory, after having prepared the way by
                  various hints which he from time to time let fall, proposed for the hand of
                  Estelle, the old man, though somewhat startled at first, could not refuse his
                  consent, and the affair was settled as far as he was concerned.</p>
               <p>With Estelle, Emory was obliged to use the greatest caution. He had made up his
                  mind to possess her at any and every cost—not that she had inspired him with love,
                  for that of course was a feeling of which he knew nothing, but her marvellous
                  beauty had excited his lasciviousness, and, besides, with a desire to tyrannize
                  natural to him, he wished to break her haughty spirit—to make her acknowledge him
                  as her master. He was not long in discovering her weak point, but he did not at
                  once attack it. He approached her gradually, with a bearing like that of a saint,
                  and at first won her respect by a thousand little delicate attentions; he next, in
                  a voice low and musical, discoursed of human life—its joys and sorrows, its hopes
                  and its fears—he drew an affecting picture of a young heart deceived and hopes
                  blighted—he spoke of a youth who had loved devotedly, but had been shamefully
                  deceived—and when he had got thus far, and observed that his listener's bright
                  eyes were suffused with tears, he went farther, and acknowledged that such had
                  been his fate in early life, and that he had lived on without hope of happiness in
                  this world, till he had at last met with a sweet being whose glances struck like
                  sunshine into his forlorn heart, and made a more delightful heaven of earth than
                  he had known before even—then, as a deep-drawn sigh escaped her, he took her<pb
                     n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6405-00000056"/> passive hand gently in his own, and
                  avowed that she was that sweet being—her's the glances that had irradiated his
                  dull soul again.</p>
               <p>She told him that she pitied him—from her soul she pitied him—but that she could
                  not return his love. She did not say, however, that she would not marry him, and
                  his success was as complete as he had wished. He felt certain that she was his—his
                  beyond the possibility of a failure—for he had other means to win her besides the
                  power of his eloquence; her sisters should sing his praises constantly, and her
                  father's necessities should plead for him. He calculated rightly. Fanny and
                  Florence had some new act of philanthropy to record on each succeeding day, and
                  old Mr. Grant was affectingly earnest in his appeals to his daughter. He
                  represented to her that without Emory he could do nothing; he was deeply in debt
                  to him—owed him more, in fact, than he could ever hope to pay him; he was,
                  besides, aged and friendless—he had toiled throughout many weary years to provide
                  for her, and the least she could do now was to sacrifice a little feeling to
                  insure his peace of mind; he conjured her to keep his gray hairs from being
                  brought in sorrow to the grave—this and much more of a like nature did he say to
                  her—and thus importuned day after day, how could she refuse? She yielded—she gave
                  the fatal promise, and then indeed the last ray of hope in her heart went out, for
                  the faintest possibility of a re-union with James Ely—her first, her last, her
                  only love—was at an end.</p>
               <p>Time sped on, and the day fixed upon for her marriage was fast approaching. She
                  was not controlled in any wish or whim in the meantime. She went where she
                  pleased, did what she pleased, made just such acquaintances as suited her, and was
                  indeed the only actually free person beneath her father's roof. There was policy
                  in this, for Emory was not sure of her till the law gave him the power to call her
                  his wife. She was a constant visitor at the house of Mr. Miller, the old gentleman
                  alluded to in Part I. of this story, and he was extremely fond of her. He could
                  not help feeling grieved at the alliance she was about to form, and often in the
                  hope of getting her to make a confidant of him, so that he might, if possible,
                  prevent the marriage from taking place, he took an old man's privilege, and
                  alluded to the singularity of her choice, but all to no purpose, for she either
                  avoided a reply, or else made some playful remark to the effect that she thought
                  she would take the first that came along, for fear she might not get another
                  offer. With all his knowledge of the world, however, Mr. Miller could not fail to
                  observe a shade of sadness even in the young girl's pleasantry, and this was one
                  reason why he introduced her to his god-son, Harry B——. He thought that the young
                  man might, perhaps, accomplish what the old one had failed to do, and how far he
                  was borne out in this idea the reader is already aware. Harry managed to fall
                  deeply in love—he managed likewise to ascertain that the young lady's affections
                  were pre-engaged—but he did not manage to find out why Estelle had resolved to
                  marry Everard Emory. He only learned that she was the victim of circumstances over
                  which she had no control, and that she did not love the man she was about to
                  marry.</p>
               <p>The day so full of importance to Estelle at length arrived, but it was to her a
                  day rather of mourning than of rejoicing. She felt more like going to the grave
                  than to the altar, and those who surrounded her seemed to be similarly affected.
                  An air of sombre gloom pervaded everything around. The countenances of Fanny and
                  Florence wore an expression, while they were dressing the bride, as though they
                  were preparing a corpse for burial, while Mr. Grant moped about, the picture of
                  despair. It was no feeling of regret at parting with a beloved relative which
                  called forth these sensations of depression, but a leaden weight hung around the
                  hearts of sisters and father, produced by the fear of an indefinable something in
                  the future. Like wily gamblers who knew every card<pb n="112-113"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000057"/> in the pack, they had staked their all upon the
                  turning of one, but trembled lest the spots upon it should change, after it was
                  exposed to view.</p>
               <p>The ceremony of dressing had been got through, and Estelle had retired to her room
                  to collect her scattered thoughts previous to the arrival of the bridegroom. While
                  reflecting upon the painful position in which she found herself placed, she heard
                  a light tap at the door of her apartment, and upon bidding the applicant for
                  admission enter, Kate O'Donnell, the hired girl, made her appearance. She was a
                  stout, hearty, uncouth-looking Irish girl, about twenty-two years of age, with
                  little restless blue eyes, which kept constantly turning in their sockets—except
                  when she looked straight at an object—first to the right and then to the left,
                  like the pendulum of a clock. Her hair was very light, almost flaxon, indeed; her
                  face round and rosy; her mouth capacious, and well filled with large,
                  yellow-colored teeth; her lips full and pouting; and her nose a queer looking
                  article, something the shape of a pullet's egg. Her appearance, at a first glance,
                  was that of an ignorant, careless, good-natured creature; but when excited by
                  anger, she looked terribly vindictive, and her eyes possessed a decidedly crazy
                  expression. It was the general impression, from a certain incoherence in her
                  speech occasionally, that she was not exactly sane, and on this account she had
                  gained the cognomen of Crazy Kate; but, although occasionally displaying great
                  passion, she had never laid violent hands upon anybody, and was considered rather
                  harmless.</p>
               <p>'Iv ye plaze, mam,' she said, in a low tone, as though fearful of being overheard,
                  at the same time advancing into the room, and closing the door behind her, 'ye
                  arn't afther bein' married yit, are ye?'</p>
               <p>'No,' answered Estelle, smiling, in spite of herself at the queer object before
                  her—'the ceremony has not been performed yet; but why do you ask?'</p>
               <p>'Ah, yis, that's it—exactly—now, d'ye mind?' said the girl, mysteriously.</p>
               <p>'Why, what a strange creature?' said Estelle, smiling; 'what do you want, Kate?
                  Can I do anything for you?'</p>
               <p>'Yis, ye cud, iv ye wud,' answered Kate, abruptly; 'but ye wudn't—an' d'ye know
                  the reason that ye wudn't?'</p>
               <p>'No, I don't,' replied Estelle, good-humoredly; 'what is the reason, Kate?'</p>
               <p>'May be it ain't for the likes o' me to be tellin' ye, an' the praste waitin' for
                  ye,' answered Kate, an' I won't—but look-see! Did you ever hear a story?'</p>
               <p>'Oh, yes,' said Estelle, 'I've heard a good many stories.'</p>
               <p>'<emph>Did</emph> ye, now?' exclaimed Kate, as though surprised at the admission,
                  'well, holt on, now, I'll tell ye a story, will I?'</p>
               <p>'Well, yes,' answered Estelle, 'if it isn't too long, but I have not much time
                  now. I must be going presently.'</p>
               <p>'O, it'll not take me long,' said Kate, 'it's a short story, but it has a long
                  maning. This is it, d'ye mind, now? Once there was a wolf—d'ye mind that? a wolf!
                  a wolf!' and her eyes sparkled at each repetition of the word till they glowed
                  like balls of fire—'an' he was in the habit of slaughterin' lambs, and nobody cud
                  catch him at it, bekase he had so much the way iv the fox wid him—well (and here
                  the tears started into her eyes,) he killed two lambs that meself knew, afther he
                  coaxed thim away from the flock, and thin he got his ugly eyes—may the devil burn
                  him!—upon another, an' I cudn't save her, bekase the wolf was very powerful, an' I
                  darent cum betune thim to warn her, and so, God help her! she was lost, so she
                  was! and bursting into an agony of tears, the strange being rushed abruptly from
                  the apartment and disappeared.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
               <p>A DISAGREEABLE feeling crept over Estelle after Kate O'Donnell had left her, for
                  although she did not see how the disconnected, ambiguous and crazy-like rigmarole
                  of the girl could in any way apply to her, she could not help thinking it strange
                  that the wild creature should have taken such a time to converse with her,
                  especially as she had never indulged in any such remarks before. She would have
                  questioned her further, had she not so suddenly disappeared, and indeed she was
                  turning over in her mind the propriety of calling her back, when Fanny entered the
                  room and informed her that the carriages had arrived, and the party were all ready
                  to start for church. They waited only for her. She strove to shake off the
                  unpleasant feeling which oppressed her, and following her sister she joined the
                  company assembled below, and an hour after wards she stood before the altar as the
                  bride of the unprincipled, hypocritical, merciless, marble-hearted Everard
                  Emory.</p>
               <p>The holy edifice was filled with the gay and fashionable sojourners in ——, and a
                  death-like silence followed the first words of the venerable pastor as he began
                  the impressive marriage ceremony. Every eye was fixed upon the bridal group, and
                  every ear was strained to catch the responses as they fell from the lips of the
                  bride and groom. Estelle was deathly pale and motionless as marble. She seemed to
                  go through the ceremony mechanically and without a knowledge of what she was doing
                  till called upon to answer the important interrogatory propounded by the minister,
                  and then her bosom heaved convulsively as she slightly inclined her head
                  affirmatively. Her mind had wandered far away from the scene in which she was then
                  an actor. She had, in imagination, been back again to St. Louis, and was wandering
                  hand in hand with James Ely through the little lane skirted with sweet wild
                  flowers which led to the old school-house. She had followed up this train of
                  thought, and, in a few short moments had reviewed her whole past life, and at the
                  time she was recalled to herself, she was wondering in what part of the world the
                  youth she had loved—nay, did even now love—so ardently, might be, and whether
                     <emph>he</emph> had wedded another. No wonder, then, that her cheek flushed and
                  her bosom heaved—no wonder that a tear glistened in her bright eye, and her heart
                  swelled almost to bursting when the <emph>real</emph> suddenly and rudely usurped
                  the place of the <emph>ideal.</emph> Nor was Estelle's the only face upon which a
                  shade of sorrow rested. Dejection was painfully apparent upon the countenances of
                  Fanny and Florence—and old Mr. Grant as he tottered forward to give the bride
                  away, was the picture of woe. Emory was the only person during the ceremony who
                  preserved his usual bearing. Haughty and erect he stood amid the sorrowing throng,
                  with a look of triumph in his calculating eye, and exultation in his cold,
                  feelingless heart.</p>
               <p>At length the ceremony was ended, and the friends of the parties gathered around
                  to wish them joy, but their congratulatory remarks and flattering speeches were
                  painful to Estelle, who felt relieved when once more in her carriage and on the
                  way towards home.</p>
               <p>Bob Barker and Sam Slocumb were among the persons present in the church. They
                  lingered about the doors till the<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6405-00000059"/>
                  bridal party had departed, and when the sound of the wheels of the last carriage
                  had died away, Bob remarked—</p>
               <p>'She is a glorious bride, and no mistake! I almost felt like deserting
                  bachelorhood myself as I looked at her!'</p>
               <p>'I can't say her appearance produced any such effect upon me,' replied Sam
                  Slocumb, 'on the contrary, I cannot help thinking that Emory, shrewd as he is, has
                  purchased a piece of property this time which will prove troublesome to him.
                  Didn't you observe how woe-begone she looked? Why, she actually shed tears as she
                  nodded the important 'yes!''</p>
               <p>'A little frightened, that's all,' said Bob Barker. 'That feeling 'll wear off
                  after she has been married a week or two—but, let the case go as it will, I'm
                  inclined to think Emory will be boss in his own house. If he had the power to
                  marry her against her consent, he will certainly have the power to control her now
                  that she is his.'</p>
               <p>'Don't be too sure of that,' said Sam Slocumb, emphatically—'I tell you she has
                  that in her which will not brook restraint, or there is nothing in physiognomy—and
                  if he undertakes to rule her by harsh means, he'll catch 'Hail Columby,' with the
                  variations, done up in the most approved domestic style.</p>
               <p>'In that case we may look for a breeze speedily,' remarked Bob Barker, 'for I
                  don't believe Emory will ever allow any woman to control him.'</p>
               <p>'He may indulge her till he gets tired of her,' answered Sam. 'I'll give them a
                  year to live together, and then look out for squalls.'</p>
               <p>'Yes, both infantile and matronly!' replied Bob, laughing at what he considered an
                  excellent pun.</p>
               <p>'Who knows, now,' said Sam Slocumb, after cogitating deeply for a few moments,
                  'but what, if they should fall out and separate, she might accept the friendship
                  and protection of a good-looking fellow like myself? Stranger things have
                  happened.'</p>
               <p>'Why, I thought just now,' answered Bob, 'you regarded her as such 'bad
                  property!''</p>
               <p>'O, as a <emph>wife,</emph>' answered Sam. 'As a wife, of course, but not as a
                     <emph>friend!</emph> There's a vast difference, you know—a vast
                  difference.'</p>
               <p>'So there is, 'replied Bob, 'but, in my opinion, there is just about as much
                  likelihood of her becoming your <emph>wife</emph> as your <emph>friend.'</emph>
               </p>
               <p>'Time will tell,' said Sam, confidently. 'Of course, I don't look upon it as a
                  sure thing, but I shall keep a sharp look-out in this direction, so that if any
                  opportunity offers I may embrace it.'</p>
               <p>'Yes, and the lady, too, at the same time,' answered Bob, again laughing heartily
                  at his own wit—'but how will you keep yourself posted up in matters and things
                  around here?'</p>
               <p>'By making a fast friend of Kate O'Donnell,' answered Slocumb. 'A few shillings
                  occasionally will do that, and I may then know as much of their family affairs as
                  they do themselves. All I have to do is to visit here semi occasionally, when I
                  have nothing better to do in New York, and that will be rather a pleasure than a
                  trouble.'</p>
               <p>'Well, success to you,' said Bob, 'but I must say that you can get up a very large
                  quantity of hope on a very small capital'—and, locking arms, the two worthies
                  sauntered off leisurely in the direction of their hotel</p>
               <p>Hardly had they disappeared when George Cantwell emerged from behind one of the
                  pillars in front of the church-porch, where he had, in concealment, been listening
                  to their conversation.</p>
               <p>'Ha, ha!' he chuckled, triumphantly, 'is that your game, Sammy, my boy? Well, it
                  would be a good one if you had it all to yourself, but, unfortunately for you, I
                  must take a hand—not to play against you, however. O, no, I rather like your
                  project—but then I want to make something out of it myself, if possible. I don't
                  know that I can, but there is no<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6405-00000060"/> harm
                  in being prepared, if a chance offers, to take advantage of it,' and, whistling a
                  low tune, he took his way towards Emory's house. Having arrived there, he admitted
                  himself with his latch-key, and, entering the drawing-room, he summoned a servant,
                  and bade her inform Mr. Emory he wished to speak with him. The servant went as
                  directed, and shortly afterwards the bridegroom made his appearance.</p>
               <p>An angry frown contracted his brow as he gazed at his despicable employee, and in
                  a tone of displeasure, but almost in a whisper, he inquired—</p>
               <p>'What has happened now, you bird of evil omen! You are eternally intruding
                  yourself upon me when I least wish to see you. What has happened, I ask?'</p>
               <p>'Nothing serious,' replied Cantwell, with provoking indifference.'</p>
               <p>'Then what are you here for?' growled Emory.</p>
               <p>'Well, I came to tell you,' said Cantwell, 'that a certain young lady, Jenny
                  Mathews by name, has of late grown very suspicious of you, and if you do not wish
                  to see her here soon, you had better call upon her,'</p>
               <p>'She has no knowledge of my marriage, has she?' asked Emory, in some alarm.</p>
               <p>'No,' replied Cantwell, 'I don't suppose she has—that is, no positive knowledge,
                  but I know she suspects something of the kind, and with a jealous woman that's
                  about as bad as if she was certain of it. At all events, she says you have
                  neglected her long enough, and now if you don't call upon her, she will upon
                  you.'</p>
               <p>'Fool that I was,' said Emory, bitterly, 'to let her, in a moment of weakness,
                  know anything about my residence.'</p>
               <p>'But you didn't think of marrying then,' said Cantwell, as though anxious to find
                  an excuse for his employer's imprudence</p>
               <p>'That's very true,' rejoined Emory, 'but I had no business to place myself in her
                  power under any circumstances. However ever, the mischief is done, and the thing
                  now is to remedy it. Jenny must not come here, at least, not at present.'</p>
               <p>'Then you must go there,' rejoined Cantwell.</p>
               <p>'Won't money satisfy her?' snarled Emory, impatiently.</p>
               <p>'I'm afraid not,' answered Cantwell, 'what she wants is marriage first, as per
                  agreement, and as much money afterwards as you please.'</p>
               <p>'D—n her!' exclaimed Emory, furiously, 'I wish she was dead!' Then, after a moment
                  of profound thought, he continued in a tone of affected friendship, 'Don't you
                  think, my dear George, that she might possibly be taken very ill, and die before
                  assistance could reach her? Don't you think she might?'</p>
               <p>'No,' said Cantwell, positively, looking at the same time straight in his
                  employer's eye, '<emph>I'm sure she can't</emph>—there was a young lady once who
                  fell sick and died very singularly, just after such a conversation as the present
                  one between us had taken place, and after her death you seemed to think that I had
                  a hand in her sudden departure to another world. This suspicion you have held as a
                  rod over me to mould me to your wishes. Now, for fear of accidents, I feel
                  constrained to say that I do not think Jenny Matthews can possibly be taken sick
                  unless you append your signature to a paper certifying that such is your earnest
                  wish—in that case she might possibly be ailing.'</p>
               <p>'Scoundrel!' cried Emory, suddenly changing his manner, 'you forgot that you are
                  in my power—that I have evidence enough to hang you!'</p>
               <p>'I don't forget anything;' replied Cantwell, with the most imperturbable
                  self-possession—'I know that you are very rich and powerful, and that some time
                  since you might have crushed me with a word, but I also know, as well as you do,
                  that your principal witness against me, Jack Jacobs, died some two weeks since,
                  and that you would find it a very hard matter to make out a case against me, even
                  if you felt so disposed, which<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6405-00000061"/> you do
                  not, for I am too deep in your counsels for you to make an enemy of me now.
                  However, I do not wish to take any advantage of the influence you have reposed in
                  me. The fact is we are necessary to each other, and may as well be friends. I want
                  your money, and you want my services, which you shall always have, but not on the
                  same terms as ever. Heretofore I have not only transacted your business, but taken
                  the sole risk of the consequences, for you have so planned it that I could not
                  possibly implicate you if I wished to do so. Hereafter we must have a different
                  understanding. We must be on an equality. I am still willing to do the work, but
                  you must share the risk. I hope we understand each other?'</p>
               <p>'We do,' said Emory, decisively, 'and now you will oblige me by leaving these
                  premises as speedily as possible and never entering them again till you can do so
                  with a clearer view of my true character. What! have you been so long intimate
                  with me without learning that in my composition fear has no part? Are you so
                  foolish as to suppose that I who never yet knew what it was to command and not be
                  obeyed, could for a moment stoop to make terms with such a thing as you are?
                  Begone, sir!'</p>
               <p>'Very well,' said Cantwell, rising, and approaching the door, 'and shall I inform
                  Jenny Matthews that you are married, and fetch her up to visit you and your bride,
                  and bear testimony to the truth of her story when she swears that you first
                  abducted her from home, and then seduced her by the most solemn protestations of
                  honorable marriage? Shall I, eh?' And he grinned exultingly.</p>
               <p>'Yes,' answered Emory, without being at all disconcerted, 'but before you do so it
                  may interest you to know that there is a certain document in existence which I can
                  at any time cause to be exhibited, although I am not supposed to have any
                  knowledge of it, which would bear rather hard against you if at any time you
                  should be arrested on a capital charge. It is nothing less than a voluntary
                  confession of murder in which you are implicated made by one Jack Jacobs and
                  witnessed by two persons who can be found when wanted—that's all!'</p>
               <p>A change came over the countenance of Cantwell, and his manner altered at
                  once.</p>
               <p>'I see,' he said, with an air of deference, 'that it is useless for me to attempt
                  to out-general you, and I won't try it again. Now, then, what do you wish me to
                  do?'</p>
               <p>'Prevent the woman we are talking of from coming here,' said Emory, sternly; 'I
                  don't wish you to proceed to extremities if you can avoid it, but she must not be
                  seen here. Use what means you please, but keep her away. If she makes her
                  appearance here you shall answer it—now, begone!'</p>
               <p>Cantwell instantly, in the most obsequious manner withdrew, and Emory returned to
                  the party from the midst of which he had been so unceremoniously called but a few
                  moments before.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <p>SIX months of married life passed over the head of Estelle, and further than the
                  disquietude sometimes occasioned her by the recollection of her unhappy love for
                  James Ely, which would intrude itself in spite of her, she had no reason to regret
                  the step which she had taken. Emory was still very kind, not only to her, but to
                  her father and sisters. Mr. Grant and his two elder daughters, with the servant,
                  Kate O'Donnell, still occupied the house which Emory had prepared for them next
                  his own, in ——. They had never left it for any great length of time from the hour
                  they first entered it. Emory<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6405-00000062"/> had taken
                  his wife to New York when the fall months set in, and had invited her relatives to
                  accompany them, but as there was nothing in the way of business offering to Mr.
                  Grant, he felt better satisfied to stay where he was, and so, indeed, did his
                  daughters, for, contemptible as were their general characteristics, they still had
                  a feeling of pride which kept them from wishing to figure in fashionable city-life
                  at the expense of one who was only related to them by marriage. After staying a
                  while in New York, Emory started on a travelling tour with Estelle, and having
                  visited a number of the Southern States, in doing which some four months were very
                  pleasantly spent, again returned homeward, and at the request of Estelle, who had
                  lost all relish for mingling with the world, and wished, for a while, to lead a
                  retired life, he removed her to ——, where she took up her residence with her
                  father and sisters, although the winter was not yet over, and remained himself in
                  the city, only visiting her once or twice at most during each week.</p>
               <p>It was at this time (about six months in all, after Estelle's marriage) that one
                  evening while Kate O'Donnell was engaged at her ordinary avocations in the kitchen
                  of Mr. Grant's residence, the door suddenly opened, and the head of Mr. George
                  Cantwell was thrust into the apartment.</p>
               <p>'How are you, Kate?' he said, with a familiar nod.</p>
               <p>At the time of the interruption, Kate was wiping a large-sized dinner plate, but
                  she stopped in the midst of her task, and while an indignant look settled upon her
                  face, she replied—</p>
               <p>'It's little the betther I am for seein' the likes o' you, ye milk-faced thafe o'
                  the world! Get out'o' that!'</p>
               <p>'Come, come, Kate,' said Cantwell, coaxingly, 'let by-gones be by-gones. Is it
                  possible you still remember a matter that happened so many years ago?'</p>
               <p>'Is it possible do I remimber it?' replied Kate, in a tone of surprise, 'why, ye
                  devil's bird, d'ye think will I ever forget it? A father and mother turned into
                  the sthreets in the dead o winter, an' compelled to beg their bread from dure to
                  dure!—d'ye think will I forget that? and a purty young crather that I'd ha' laid
                  down me life for—though to be sure she was no kin to me—kilt and murdered, and
                  ruinated entirely!—d'ye think will I forget that? May me soul niver have a restin'
                  place in glory iv I forget it! Get out o' that, I say wance more, ye scum iv a
                  scurvy pig's lavin's—there's p'isin in'yer two bad lookin' eyes, so there is!'</p>
               <p>'I admit you've had some cause to complain, Kate,' said Cantwell, soothingly, 'but
                  it was no fault of mine. I only acted by the direction of another, you know. I
                  turned your family into the street, it is true, but I was forced to do so or lose
                  my situation; and if I had not performed the disagreeable task somebody else
                  would. As for Effie Johnson, I had no part in her undoing, and if she were alive,
                  and you could have speech with her, she'd tell you so'</p>
               <p>'Ye-<emph>lie</emph>-she-wouldn't!' exclaimed Kate, in a great passion, and
                  squeezing a whole sentence into one word, 'for I <emph>do</emph> have spache wid
                  her every night. She's dead, that's thrue for ye—an' so is me father an' me
                  mother, but that don't sthop me shpakin' to thim. They're always wid me whin I'm
                  ashlape, an' sometimes they whispers in my ear whin I'm awake, and they tells me
                  you're a liar. But fhat d'ye want wid me, for the divil niver comes without a
                  purpose?'</p>
               <p>'I want to make friends with you, Kate,' replied Cantwell, in a tone of assumed
                  sincerity.</p>
               <p>'Iv that's fhat ye want,'replied Kate, determinedly, 'it's as well for ye to lave
                  at wance, for till ye, can raise the dead it's no friend o' mine ye'll be afther
                  findin' yerself.'</p>
               <p>'You'll think differently, Kate,' remarked Cantwell, with much humility, 'when I
                  tell you what I want you to do. You have no great affection for Emory, I know,
                  have you?'</p>
               <p>'Affection for him,' answered Kate, a look of malignity lighting up her wild eyes.
                  'Oh yis, it's the big affection I<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6405-00000063"/> feel
                  for him! Don't I wish I could show him how much I love him! <emph>Don't I,
                     though!'</emph>
               </p>
               <p>'Does he know you are here? asked Cantwell.</p>
               <p>'He does know I'm here, in course,' answered Kate, 'for it's a hundred times he's
                  seen me, but big bad luck to him, he don't know who I am—he don't recollect
                  me.'</p>
               <p>'There's the difference between him and me,' answered Cantwell, 'now, I knew you
                  the moment I saw you. I never forget a countenance that interests me. I knew you
                  at once, but I did not let Emery into the secret, and this ought to convince you
                  that I am your friend. I want to serve you, Kate.'</p>
               <p>'Well, thin,' said Kate, 'it's little I value the friendship iv a servant who
                  wears the divil's livery. Ye can't be Misther Emory's friend an' mine at the same
                  time, d'ye hear that, now?'</p>
               <p>'Kate,' said Cantwell, stepping close to the girl, and lowering his voice to a
                  whisper, 'I'll let you into a secret. I hate Everard Emory as intensely, nay, more
                  intensely, than you do. For years he has held me under his brutal control, and he
                  has ruled me with a rod of iron. Now I am determined to free myself from him the
                  first opportunity that offers. In the meantime I wish to gratify my revenge a
                  little. Here's a letter (and at the same time he took one from his pocket) which I
                  stole from Emory. It is one which he received from his last victim, Jenny
                  Matthews, since his marriage, I want you to take it to his wife, and tell her you
                  found it somewhere about the house. You can hint at the same time that Emory must
                  accidentally have dropt it from his pocket during one of his visits. As he has not
                  recognised you, you can run no risk in doing as I wish you to, and Emory will
                  doubtless himself believe that he has actually lost it.'</p>
               <p>'An' d'ye think will it do him a harm, if his wife gets it?' inquired Kate,
                  anxiously.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>'Think,'</emph> answered Cantwell, 'I <emph>know</emph> it will. He would
                  rather face the devil himself than to look at his wife after she has read that
                  letter. He has had a nice, pleasant time of it thus far, and now I am anxious to
                  vary the scene a little for him. Will you take the letter?'</p>
               <p>'D'ye you think wud I ate iv I was hungry?' answered Kate, with alacrity, 'to be
                  sure I'll take it to her, and iv it'll ownly make <emph>him</emph> oncomfortable,
                  I don't care iv I die afther.</p>
               <p>'That's a brave girl!' exclaimed Cantwell, approvingly, 'and now I must go. Emory
                  is to be up from New York to-morrow afternoon, and you had better put the letter
                  into the hands of his wife in the morning so that she will be prepared to receive
                  him properly. Do you understand, Kate, eh?'</p>
               <p>'<emph>I do!</emph>' was the laconic reply, and Cantwell took his departure.</p>
               <p>After he was gone, Kate unfolded the letter, and turning it over and over, she
                  viewed it upon all sides, and at length muttered to herself, 'It's little good
                  I'll be doin' by lookin' at ye, for sure I can't read ye at all at all—but I wish
                  I cud, for I'd like to know iv the poor crathur it kem from has the power she
                  should have to be able to cope wid the divil. Mrs. Emory shall have ye anyways,'
                  she concluded, as she refolded the letter, placed it safely in her pocket, and
                  resumed her work.</p>
               <p>True to her word, the next morning after breakfast Kate entered the drawing-room
                  where Estelle sat alone, poring over the pages of the last new novel, in which she
                  had become apparently deeply interested, and holding forth the letter, she
                  remarked—</p>
               <p>'Here's a letther I found upon the stairs three or four days ago, jist after the
                  masther goin' away, an' I forgot to give it to ye till this moment, whin it's just
                  afther comin' into me mind.'</p>
               <p>'Well, throw it upon the mantle-piece,' said Estelle, carelessly, 'and he'll get
                  it when he comes home.'</p>
               <p>'Mebbe it's not for himself it is,' remarked Kate, pertinaciously, still holding
                  the letter, 'mebbe it's for some won else, an' hadn't ye betther look at it
                  jist?'</p>
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6405-00000064"/>
               <p>Estelle withdrew her eyes from the book which she was reading and glanced at the
                  superscription. She observed that it was addressed to her husband, and was about
                  to throw it aside, when the delicate style of its chirography struck her and she
                  was induced to open it. The first sentence which she read caused a sudden tremor
                  to seize her, and laying aside her book, she said, with as much composure as she
                  could command, 'you may go, now, Kate,' and the girl was about moving toward the
                  door, when she added, 'you need not mention to any one that you found this
                  letter.'</p>
               <p>'Indade I'll not, mam,' was the answer, and the next moment Estelle was alone.</p>
               <p>With a beating heart she recommenced the perusal of the epistle, which was a
                  rather short one, and from the cramped and crooked style of the writing had
                  evidently been penned by one suffering from nervous agitation. It was dated a
                  Troy, some time previously, and ran as follows:</p>

                           <p>"EVERARD EMORY—<hi rend="i"/>Sir: There was a time when I would have
                              commenced a letter to you differently, but your treatment of me lately
                              has proved that you are unworthy my slightest regard. For two years
                              now you have put me off with promises made only to be broken, till at
                              length I have discovered that truth has no part in you—that you are a
                              heartless villain—a hypocrite of the very worst stamp. Having made
                              this discovery, I am satisfied that for me there is no more happiness
                              in this life; but one thing yet remains for me, and that is
                                 <emph>revenge.</emph> I will unmask you to the world. Thus far you
                              have prevented my doing so, by removing me from place to place, and
                              allaying my awakened fears by newly invented lies, but you shall do so
                              no longer. In spite of all your pains to prevent it, I have gained the
                              information that you are married, which, of course renders it
                              impossible for you to render me the only reparation which I would
                              accept at your hands, and if I am ever permitted to rise from the bed
                              of sickness, upon which I now lie, your wife shall hear, and from my
                              lips, too, what a black-hearted fiend she has married. You have
                              falsely imagined all along, sir, that because you possessed immense
                              wealth you could make merchandize of a friendless girl's affections,
                              and when I have urged you, as I repeatedly have done, to redeem your
                              oath, solemnly sworn in the sight of Heaven, to make me your wife, you
                              have either put me off with some lame excuse, or insulted me with the
                              proffer of a tithe of your ill-gotten wealth. Devil! can your gold
                              restore my peace of mind? Can it render me virtuous, and happy, and
                              free from guilt, as I was before I knew you? God of Heaven! when I
                              reflect upon <emph>all</emph> that you have urged me to it seems that
                              reason will desert her throne and I shall go wild! For the second time
                              I am lying upon a sick bed in this den of horror, the murderess of my
                              own offspring! I know, I feel, that a terrible retribution must follow
                              this dreadful guilt, but I shall not suffer alone, for you it was—you,
                              the father of my unborn babes—who urged me, by threats and promises,
                              and implorations, to the commission of the hellish crime, and you are
                              equally culpable. I may, perhaps, not live through this last trial,
                              but think not that you will escape punishment, even if my guilty soul
                              does wing its flight to another world before I have the power to call
                              you to account—for be assured of this: we shall meet hereafter at the
                              bar of an offended Deity. <emph>There,</emph> there can be no
                              concealment, and your black deeds will speak trumpet-tongued against
                              you. For the present I have done, but you shall hear from me again,
                              perhaps when you least expect it. My earnest prayer is now that before
                              I die I may see your wife.</p>

               <p>It would be impossible to describe the sensations which Estelle experienced after
                  she had finished the perusal of this letter. Fear, doubt, and rage took possession
                  of her by turns, and she knew not at what conclusion to come. At first she was
                  fearful that the letter contained nothing but truth—that she had indeed married a
                  wretch, for whose diabolical crimes she could find no name—then it occurred to her
                  that perhaps it was only a plan to injure her husband, and then again her mind
                  reverted to the story of the wolf and the lamb so singularly related by Kate
                  O'Donnell, on the day of her marriage, the application of which was now palpable,
                  if Emory was indeed the villain which the latter represented him to be, and
                  burning with rage as she thought of this, she summoned the girl, and striving to
                  put on an air of indifference, she said:—</p>
               <p>'Kate, on the morning of my marriage you commenced telling me a story which you
                  did not finish, and it has just occurred to me that I should like to hear the
                  termination of it. Sit down and relate it now, won't you?'</p>
               <p>'Did I tell you the story iv the wolf and the lambs?' questioned Kate, as though
                  surprised.</p>
               <p>'Of course you did,' answered Estelle, 'surely you cannot have forgotten it
                  already.'</p>
               <p>'I didn't tell you any names, did I?' asked Kate.</p>
               <p>'No,' replied Estelle, 'and that's just what I wish to inquire about—what were the
                  wolf and his victims called?'</p>
               <p>'Which?' said Kate, seemingly very much puzzled.</p>
               <p>'Nonsense,' answered Estelle, somewhat angrily, 'you understand me well enough.
                  Come, tell me at once.'</p>
               <p>'An' fhat 'll I tell ye?' asked Kate, still preserving the same puzzled expression
                  of countenance.</p>
               <p>'Kate,' said Estelle, impressively, at the same time regarding the girl with a
                  look of fixed scrutiny, 'answer me honestly —do you know anything derogatory to my
                  husband's character as a man of integrity? If you do, don't hesitate to tell it,
                  and I promise you, upon my sacred honor, no harm shall come to you in
                  consequence.'</p>
               <p>'You won't tell him who tould ye?' said, Kate, interrogatively.</p>
               <p>'Never,' replied Estelle, 'as I am a Christian.'</p>
               <p>Then,' was the girl's reply, 'I'll tell ye. It's a hard thing to say to a lady
                  that's only just after being married, but your husband is the bloodiest vilyan
                  unhung, so he is, an' there's more nor myself knows that same.'</p>
               <p>'Be careful, Kate, how you make assertions,' said Estelle, 'what proof have you
                  that Mr. Emory is a bad man?'</p>
               <p>'The proof of me own ears and eyes,' answered Kate, 'and fhat better 'ud I want? I
                  know that he turned me poor ould father an' mother an' mesilf out into the
                  sthreet, an' it biting, bitther winter at the time—I know, too, that they died
                  from the effects iv it—may their souls rist in glory foriver an' iver!—I know that
                  he was the manes of killin' Thomas Gardener the shoemaker in the same may—I know
                  that he led Effie Johnson and Kate Collins (two swate, pretty sewin' girls, that
                  me mother washed for whin mesilf was a wee thing) asthray—I know that Kate wint
                  home to her friends when he turned her off, and died broken hearted, and I know
                  that Effie wudn't go home, bekase she was too proud, so she went on frim bad to
                  worse, till she got on Blackwell's Island, an' there she died. I know that that
                  same Effie Johnson gev me medicine wid her own hands and bought delicacies wid her
                  own money, whin I was sick and likely to die, an' I know I'll niver forgit her
                  kindness (God be good to her sowl!) nor the ill-treatment to her of the
                  black-hearted murdherer that caused her death—may the divil roast him at a slow
                  fire troughout the countless ages iv eternity, and the day afther, the heartless
                  vagabone!'</p>
               <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6405-00000066"/>
               <p>'O, Kate,' cried Estelle, bursting into tears, 'why didn't you tell me of this
                  before I was married?'</p>
               <p>'Bekase,' replied Kate, 'I was afeard to—nobody iver crossed him yit, that he did
                  not ruinate thim after, an' sure I dhreaded he might find out that I tould you.
                  But I hinted to you, an' it's me belief that iv ye'd 'a prissed me that time as ye
                  did a bit ago, I'd a tould you any way.'</p>
               <p>After her violent outburst of grief had somewhat subsided, Estelle dismissed Kate,
                  and then settled herself to cogitate upon the best plan to be pursued under the
                  circumstances.—Her first impulse was to take the letter to her father and sisters,
                  and enlighten them as to the true character of the man she had wedded. She
                  discarded this idea, however, almost as soon as it was conceived. The fact is, she
                  did not repose much confidence in her relatives, and she feared they might take
                  sides against her. She distrusted them not without reason. Emory had complete
                  control over them all. They were dependent upon him, and were bound to think and
                  act just as he wished them to, for should he take it into his head to cut off
                  their supplies, they were beggars. She therefore resolved to await her husband's
                  return—then charge him in private with his perfidy, and hear what defence he had
                  to make.</p>
               <p>Accordingly when Emory arrived some hours afterwards, instead of meeting him with
                  a smile and a cheerful greeting, as was her wont, she at once intimated her desire
                  for a few moments' private conversation with him, and led the way to their own
                  sleeping apartment.</p>
               <p>Emory had not the remotest suspicion of the true cause of his wife's evident
                  discontent. He imagined that something of a trifling nature had gone wrong around
                  the house, of which she was about to complain, and as soon as they were safely in
                  the apartment, and the door closed, he playfully attempted to throw his arms
                  around her, at the same time remarking, good-humoredly—</p>
               <p>'What's the matter now, pretty one? What has gone wrong? Has the dress-maker
                  failed to fit you? Or has your favorite bonnet been carelessly crushed? Or has
                  your magnificent shawl sustained a lasting injury? Or is your pet canary sick? Or
                  what ails you?'</p>
               <p>'Perhaps when I have enlightened you as to the real cause of my trouble,' replied
                  Estelle, in a stern, uncompromising tone such as she had never before used, 'you
                  will not feel in so playful a mood. Tell me, sir, did you ever happen, in your
                  progress through life, to make the acquaintance of a lady named Matthews—Jeannette
                  Matthews?'</p>
               <p>The interogatory came so suddenly upon Emory, that for a moment he was terribly
                  startled, and Estelle did not fail to observe it, for she was watching purposely
                  the effect of the question. It was but for a moment, however, that the bold, bad
                  man lost his self-possession, and then his brow was as placid as though nothing
                  had happened to disturb his serenity of mind, and he answered pleasantly—</p>
               <p>'No, my dear, I never knew any such person—but why do you ask?'</p>
               <p>Estelle was utterly surprised at this prompt and decisive denial of
                  acquaintanceship, and was almost inclined to think that she had been too fast.
                  Without altering her demeanor, however, she took the tell-tale letter from her
                  bosom, and deliberately opening it before him, she resumed—</p>
               <p>'Will you tell me, then, if you please, how you ever came into possession of that
                  letter?'</p>
               <p>Emory took the epistle, and after hastily glancing over it, he replied without
                  hesitation—</p>
               <p>'It would be hard to say how I came into possession of a thing which I never saw
                  before in my life. Why, Estelle, is it possible that you have allowed the
                  miserable trick of some envious wretch to awaken within you feelings of
                     jealousy<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6405-00000067"/> and doubt? Shame upon
                  you!—shame! I had hoped better things of you.'</p>
               <p>'Can it be possible,' thought Estelle, 'that this man is the guilty wretch which
                  Kate O'Donnell represented him to be? He does not start, or change color, or show
                  any sign of guilt, and yet I know the girl cannot be so much mistaken.'</p>
               <p>She stood undecided what next to say, till at length Emory broke the silence by
                  asking—</p>
               <p>'May I ask to whom I am indebted for this pleasant little domestic scene? Who is
                  your informant, Estelle? What seventh son of a seventh son has been telling your
                  fortune, for I confess I should like to consult the oracle myself.'</p>
               <p>'Some day,' replied Estelle, quietly, 'you may find the opportunity which you
                  desire, but at present I can only say that my oracle, so far as you are concerned,
                  is an infallible one. I did not think until now that so much cunning and hypocrisy
                  could exist in one person, and it is with mingled pain, mortification and shame,
                  that I am forced to remember that that person is my husband.'</p>
               <p>'Come, come, madam!' replied Emory, assuming a look of wounded dignity and
                  virtuous anger, 'this abuse has gone about far enough, and I will bear it no
                  longer! If I am to be made the victim of every malicious slanderer who comes
                  along, I shall have a pleasant life of it before I die!'</p>
               <p>'You are not likely to have a very pleasant one after you die!' exclaimed Estelle
                  indignantly, 'for the number of your crimes preclude the possibility of your ever
                  entering the abode of the blessed. You deny knowing the person alluded to in that
                  letter. Tell me, then, can you find in any corner of your memory the record of
                  such names as Effie Johnson and Catherine Collins?'</p>
               <p>For the first time during the interview Emory was unmistakably disconcerted. All
                  along he had imagined that the letter was the only proof which Estelle had of his
                  misdeeds, and he had hoped to be able by stratagem to obviate any difficulty
                  ficulty which might arise from that. But when he heard the names of two of his
                  victims of years gone by mentioned he felt satisfied that his wife had had, in
                  some mysterious way, an interview with some person intimately acquainted with his
                  past history. Finding that concealment was longer useless, therefore, he put a
                  bold face upon the matter, and exclaimed, while a frown dark and terrible settled
                  upon his brow—</p>
               <p>'Well, madam, you have taken considerable pains to render yourself miserable, and
                  if the current of your life should not, hereafter, run as smoothly as heretofore
                  you will have yourself to thank for it. It is full time now, that I should take
                  you in hand. I have been too indulgent with you all along—have allowed you too
                  many privileges—it has caused you some trouble, doubtless, to arrive at the
                  information you possess concerning my true character, but you have more to learn,
                  and the rest will come easier—you will not be obliged to seek for it out of the
                  house. Come, mistress, put by that frown, which I consider decidedly out of place,
                  and endeavor to look more the character of a submissive wife.'</p>
               <p>The rich blood mounted to Estelle's cheeks, and her eyes sparkled with rage as she
                  replied—</p>
               <p>'If you expect to control me as you have been in the habit of controlling every
                  body else, you will find that you are laboring under a sad mistake. Had you humbly
                  acknowledged your offences, and promised faithfully to atone for them by a life of
                  penitence in the future, I might perhaps have been disposed to remain silent
                  concerning your misdeeds, though I should never again under any circumstances have
                  looked upon you as my husband—but your impudent bearing and evident callousness of
                  heart make it painfully apparent to me that nothing is to be hoped for from
                  forbearance, and I fear I shall be obliged to unmask you to the world,
                  disagreeable as the task will be to me.'</p>
               <p>'Dare to utter one word of what you have learned,' said Emory, seizing her by the
                  wrist in his rage, and squeezing it<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6405-00000068"/>
                  till she came near crying out with pain, 'and ten minutes after-wards a messenger
                  shall be on his way westward, to make arrangements with the Governor of Missouri
                  for a requisition to arrest your father on the double charge of compounding a
                  felony, and being an accessory after the fact in a case of murder, and you shall
                  be one of the principal witnesses! Ha, ha! Does that startle you? You see, I never
                  do things by halves!'</p>
               <p>'You are a villain!' said Estelle with furious indignation—'a deeply-dyed,
                  desperate villain!'</p>
               <p>'I am your husband!' was the cool reply, 'and will be obeyed! Let me see the
                  slightest indication of displeasure upon that defiant face of yours, when abroad,
                  and tremble for the consequences! At home, you may frown as much as you think fit,
                  for since we have come to understand each other perfectly I shall like it all the
                  better—but you must observe a respectful demeanor in public, or I shall feel
                  constrained to punish you in private,' and frowning fiercely upon his now silent
                  wife, he strode imperiously from the apartment.</p>
               <p>'And this,' sobbed Estelle, when she found herself alone, 'this is the result of
                  my departure from the fixed determination never to bestow my hand where I could
                  not give my heart. What have I in the future to look forward to now? Misery!
                  misery! misery! I am the slave of a brutal master, without a will of my own, and I
                  must bear his rebuffs, his taunts, and his acts of cruelty, without daring to
                  resent them—I must plod on, uncomplainingly, day after day, the passive recipient
                  of his acts of petty malice and his soul-cutting sneers, constantly, unceasingly,
                  unrelentingly administered!—No cessation, no hope of reprieve, no prospect of rest
                  till death comes to my relief. Oh, oh, oh!' and she wept long and violently for
                  some moments, when suddenly she ceased, and with a great effort once more
                  regaining the mastery over herself she exclaimed, while a gleam of savage joy
                  shone in her grief-bedewed eyes, 'but there is one hope left me yet, and I must
                  live to compass it! The hope of dear, darling, sweet revenge! A day of retribution
                  must arrive sooner or later—and then, oh then, tremble thou demi-devil Everard
                  Emory, for it will be my turn to triumph!' She arose and applied some cool water
                  to her burning temples, then bathing and carefully wiping her eyes, she arranged
                  her hair, and shortly afterwards made her appearance among her relatives entirely
                  free from all traces of her late excitement.</p>
               <p>Estelle had made up her mind to endure misery after the above scene had taken
                  place, but she had not half calculated the extent of the troubles she would be
                  called upon to bear. She had made no allowance for what she would have to suffer
                  independently of her husband's ill-usage. She had forgotten that when he altered
                  in his conduct towards her, those over whom he had control would be obliged to do
                  the same, and accordingly no sooner did Fanny, Florence and the old man observe
                  the change in Emory's demeanor towards her, than they, too, treated her more like
                  a slave than the mistress of the house. Estelle might have retaliated. She might
                  have brought destruction upon them all, although by so doing, she would have
                  involved herself in the general ruin, but she did not wish to do so—she had a game
                  to play, and was willing to bide her time.</p>
               <p>In the meantime Emory was more hateful even than she supposed he could become. He
                  had tried every means to induce her to declare who her informant was, and failing
                  in this he racked his ingenuity to discover fresh means of making her miserable.
                  He never once thought of Kate O'Donnell, for he had lost all recollection of her,
                  and did not know in fact whether she was living or dead. He suspected Cantwell at
                  first and taxed him with being concerned in the matter, but as that individual
                  stoutly denied the imputation, and as upon strict enquiry he had not been seen
                  around the premises and no letter had been received, he was forced in his own mind
                     to<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6405-00000069"/> acquit him, and relinquish the
                  hope of finding out the real informer.</p>
               <p>Emory had reduced the business of torturing anybody in his power when he once set
                  about it to a science, but he found that in attempting to break down the spirit of
                  his wife and to render her humble and submissive, he had altogether a harder task
                  before him than he had calculated upon. One of his favorite modes of torture was
                  to taunt her with her poverty, and to regret that he had so far honored her as to
                  marry her, when he might (so he averred) without trouble have procured her as a
                  mistress—then he would speak of the indebtedness of her father to him, and boast
                  of having kept the whole family from starvation—occasionally he alluded to the
                  fact that she had a felon for a brother-in-law, and that more than likely her once
                  very dear friend, young Ely, was also a felon—he was at least a fugitive and a
                  vagabond upon the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>And yet, with all his diabolical power to wring a proud heart like that which beat
                  in Estelle's bosom, he could not succeed in forcing from her a single tear, or
                  groan, or even a sigh. She bore it all with stolid indifference, and a person
                  would have thought to look at her immovable countenance that she was past feeling,
                  but this was a mistake, and Emory knew it well. In secret she gave vent to the
                  feelings which she smothered in the presence of her husband, who felt satisfied
                  that such was the case, and greedily gloated over her sufferings. Emory did not
                  succeed in conquering her, but he did succeed in souring her disposition, and
                  killing every noble, generous feeling which she had possessed before she knew him.
                  He <emph>did</emph> succeed in rendering her distrustful, hypocritical, savage and
                  untameable. He did succeed in making her the most implacable enemy he had in the
                  world, and more dangerous than all the rest combined.</p>
               <p>Kate O'Donnell, too, had changed with Estelle. They were never seen together, but
                  they often met and talked long and earnestly when nobody was aware of the fact.
                  They made common cause against a common enemy. Kate hated Emory with a bitter,
                  lasting hatred, and her wild, uncultivated nature—although it had once possessed
                  the ingredients of humanity and good feeling—was easily changed by Estelle's
                  master spirit into the nature of a demon.</p>
               <p>Such was the state of things when Estelle became the mother of a boy, an event
                  which gave Emory the most complete satisfaction, inasmuch as it was another chain
                  upon the limbs of his already overloaded captive—another subject of splenetic
                  remark and biting inuendo. His triumph in view of the new accession to his family,
                  however, was shortlived, for Estelle had but fairly recovered from the sickness
                  consequent upon the birth of her child, when she suddenly, together with her
                  infant, and the servant Kate O'Donnell, disappeared. They took with them between
                  two and three thousand dollars in bank notes, and left behind them something of a
                  far different nature, for in the week following, while Emory (who left
                  immediately) was in New York searching for some trace of the fugitives, Fanny
                  Grant was fatally poisoned by a glass of wine which she had procured from a
                  private bottle belonging to Emory.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
               <p>WE must now return to Helen Wallace, whom we left with her aunt. The joy of the
                  young girl when she found herself safely beneath the roof of her kind relative,
                  surrounded by friends, and secure from the pursuit of her diabolical enemies, was
                  beyond the power of expression, and showed itself in the most extravagant acts of
                  endearment. She wept and laughed together, and for some moments she did nothing
                  but embrace first her aunt and then her two cousins, while Jack Ainslie, the
                  policeman, stood looking on with solid satisfaction depicted upon his good-natured
                  and good-looking countenance.</p>
               <p>The day following her happy escape, she wrote to her mother giving the full
                  particulars of her unhappy adventure, and after spending a couple of weeks with
                  her aunt, she went home under the care of Jack Ainslie.</p>
               <p>She kept up a constant correspondence with her cousin Mary after this, but more
                  than a year passed away before she again visited New York, which she did on the
                  very day that Estelle absconded from her husband.</p>
               <p>It was a happy re-union when Helen again found herself beneath her kind aunt's
                  roof, surrounded by her two cousins and Jack Ainslie, whose presence called up the
                  circumstances of her first meeting with him more than a year previously, and the
                  conversation naturally turned upon that subject. As the recollection of the
                  horrors from which she had escaped came vividly up in Helen's mind, she could not
                  help kissing her aunt and her cousin Mary as she alluded to the joyful sensations
                  which filled her when she entered their dwelling on that dreadful night.</p>
               <p>'I think, Miss Wallace,' said Jack, after he had enjoyed the scene for a while
                  without speaking, 'you might as well serve us all alike—I'm as glad you made your
                  escape from the place you was in as anybody, and though I ain't exactly your
                  cousin yet, there's no knowing how soon I may be' and he glanced mischievously at
                  Mary Gardener.</p>
               <p>'O, sir,' exclaimed Helen, in reply to his good-natured remark, when she could so
                  far command her feelings as to speak without hesitancy—'I shall never cease to
                  remember your kindness to me. I know I can never repay you except with gratitude,
                  but my heart is full of that I do assure you. O, what would have become of me, had
                  you not arrived so opportunely to rescue me.'</p>
               <p>'Why, you'd have been taken to the Station House and kept there all night, I
                  s'pose,' answered Jack, 'and in the morning you'd have been taken with other
                  prisoners before the Justice. Maybe your story'd have been b'lieved and maybe it
                  wouldn't, but anyway you'd have been put in charge of the matron and your mother
                  telegraphed to.'</p>
               <p>'Yes, and then,' exclaimed Helen, her tears starting afresh at the idea of such a
                  thing, 'it would have broken her heart to hear of me from such a place.'</p>
               <p>'Well, never mind,' said Jack, consolingly, 'the danger is over now, and there's
                  no use crying about it. I'm only sorry I've never been able to get any trace of
                  the beasts that tried to ruin you, so that I might bring 'em to justice.'</p>
               <p>'O, never mind,' said Helen, in a melancholy tone, 'let them go. They may,
                  perhaps, have repented of their wickedness and learned to do better, and if they
                  have not, they will certainly<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6405-00000071"/> tainly
                  not eseape punishment hereafter, for God's judgments are certain. As for myself I
                  freely forgive them for the injury they have done me, and I hope it was their last
                  act of the kind.'</p>
               <p>'Well,' said Jack, holding up both hands in astonishment, 'you <emph>are</emph>
                  green! Why, do you s'pose sich animals as they are ever thinks of repentance or
                  learnin' to do better? Not a bit of it. It's the Astor House to a rap over the
                  head that they swore and cursed terribly, because you got clear of 'em, and begun
                  right away layin' new plans to catch somebody else. I tell you what it is, you
                  poor, innocent little thing, you've got no more idea of their bad p'ints than they
                  have of your good ones. I'm obliged to make arrests sometimes which makes me feel
                  very bad. I don't like to take a feller in for stealin' a loaf of bread, or a ham,
                  or anything of that kind, especially if he's got a pale wife and a lot of little
                  children who look as if they was hungry, and my heart fairly bleeds when I am
                  called onto to arrest the bad son of some good but too indulgent mother, but when
                  a case like this 'ere of yours comes along, you don't know how much good it does
                  me to see the key turned onto the rotten-hearted old brutes, and to hear
                  afterwards that they'm safely lodged in the State Prison, and doin' the State good
                  service—though this ain't often the case, for they've got too much money for
                  justice to buck agin.'</p>
               <p>'Don't you think,' asked Helen, as she looked calmly into Jack's indignant face,
                  'that if, instead of sending such poor creatures as Mr. and Mrs. Waffles to prison
                  and treating them harshly, the authorities would provide some place where they
                  might have good instruction, and be taught through kindness to realize their
                  dreadful wickedness, it would have the effect of reforming them.'</p>
               <p>'I don't think nothing about it,' answered Jack, 'I <emph>know</emph> it wouldn't.
                  Charity is throwed away onto sich beasts as them. In all my experience I never yet
                  saw one of 'em show the least feelin'. I have seen murderers and highwaymen, and
                  burglars cry like babies afore now, when their heart was appealed to, but I've
                  never seen one of the traffickers in human souls like them wot had a holt o' you
                  shed a tear in my life, unless it was from rage or disappointment. Talk about
                  bringin' 'em to realize their wickedness! Why, don't you s'pose they know exactly
                  how bad they are? Of course they do, and it's a kind of a luxury for 'em to think
                  of it. They're only happy when they're doin' some work for the devil, and if you
                  take away their power to do harm, you take away the chief pleasure of their lives.
                  Why, p'raps you won't b'lieve it, but it's jest as true as you stand there, this
                  'ere class of criminals is always the first to die in the State Prison, and the
                  reason is, not because they are less able to stand the discipline than any others,
                  but because it breaks their hearts to think that they can't ruin any more
                  souls.'</p>
               <p>'Well, let's change the conversation,' interposed Mary Gardener, good naturedly:
                  'I don't think, John, you could change Helen's views of human nature if you should
                  talk all day, and furthermore, I don't think you ought to, if you could, for
                  certainly, a belief in the total depravity of a portion of our fellow creatures,
                  is not calculated to add to the happiness of the person who entertains that
                  belief.'</p>
               <p>'Who said anything about the total depravity of our fellow creatures, Molly?' said
                  Jack, turning to Mary Gardener, and playfully chucking her under the chin; 'I
                  wasn't talking of the depravity of our fellow creatures, but only of the depravity
                  of sich beasts as Mr. and Mrs. Waffles; and if you think that they belong to the
                  human family because they've got the human shape, you're mistaken. It's my opinion
                  that beasts have souls as well as human beings, and that when they die their souls
                  wander around in the air till they find the right kind of a breast to lodge into,
                  when they at once take full possession of it till Death drives them out agin. This
                  is kind 'er turning the transmigration doctrine upside down, but it looks
                  reasonable to me, and I've got no doubt that Mr. and Mrs.<pb n="142-143"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000072"/> Waffles, if they'm alive, are a couple of hyenas,
                  and very bad shaped ones at that.'</p>
               <p>'Well, well,' replied Mary, 'never mind them—let them rest for the present, and
                  let us talk of something else;' then turning to her cousin she continued, 'how
                  long are you going to stay with us, Helen?'</p>
               <p>'I don't know,' replied the young girl; 'that will depend entirely upon mother.
                  She didn't tell me how long I could stay, but said she'd write for me when she
                  wanted me to come home.'</p>
               <p>'O, I hope she won't take you away from us right off, because when you was here
                  before you was unfortunate enough to fall into the hands of a couple of such
                  outrageous——'</p>
               <p>'Hyenas,' suggested Jack Ainslie.</p>
               <p>'Creatures,' continued Mary, without noticing the interruption—'I want you to stay
                  here a few weeks at least. You will be such company for me. I have very few young
                  lady acquaintances, and for lack of other amusement I am forced the best part of
                  my time to listen to the nonsensical gabble of Jack here, who knows nothing
                  whatever of subjects which most interest me,' and she threw a sidelong mischievous
                  glance at her lover.</p>
               <p>'Ah, yes,' said Jack, emphatically, 'all right; then I s'pose I needn't finish
                  that story I commenced telling you last night, about the young woman who was
                  arrested dressed up in men's clothes, who had travelled all the way from Scotland
                  here in search of her lover. I commenced to tell you of her adventures—how she was
                  wrecked, and how she was picked up while clinging to a spar, by some fishermen—how
                  she afterwards shipped again, and was forced to turn pirate. There's where I left
                  off, and I s'pose you don't want me to finish it?'</p>
               <p>'Why, yes,' answered Mary, 'you did get me interested in that, to be sure, and I
                  should like to know how it turned out. How was it? Did she get any trace of her
                  fugitive lover?'</p>
               <p>'O, it is such nonsensical gabble,' said Jack, provokingly, I don't see how you
                  can bear to listen to it.'</p>
               <p>'What a teaze you are, Jack,' cried Mary, with a pout.</p>
               <p>'Yes, I can't help it,' answered Jack; 'I'm so ignorant of the subjects which
                  interest you.'</p>
               <p>'Come, come, Johnny,' remarked Mrs. Gardener, who, for some time; had taken no
                  part in the conversation, 'you have interested me, as well as Mary, and I have not
                  accused you of dullness; so I wish you would gratify me by finishing the story.
                  Besides, Helen, I dare say, would like to hear it.'</p>
               <p>'O, of all things!' exclaimed Helen, 'do tell it!'</p>
               <p>'Well, then,' said Jack, clearing his throat for a commencement, 'I will. You see,
                  she was brought into the station-house, one night, about 12 o'clock'——</p>
               <p>He was interrupted by a ring at the door bell, and a minute afterwards, Minnie
                  Jay, an acquaintance of Mary Gardener's, entered the apartment. She was a bright
                  eyed, rosy-cheeked, light-hearted working girl, a tailoress, over whose joyous
                  head, about eighteen summers had passed, and who had never known what grief was,
                  save when occasionally her position in life had subjected her to the insults of
                  that despicable class of men who imagine that because a girl is forced to work for
                  a livelihood, she must, of necessity, be somewhat loose in her morals. She was a
                  merry little creature, full of life and good nature, and a great favorite with
                  Mary, who advanced towards her the moment she entered, and cordially shaking hands
                  with, and kissing her, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>'Why, Minnie, I'm rejoiced to see you looking so well, after your late illness.
                  Have you entirely recovered?'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' was the answer, in a clear, musical voice, 'I am never ailing long at one
                  time, and I never felt better in my life than at present. Do you know how I took
                  that last heavy cold I had?'</p>
               <p>'No, I don't know that I do,' replied Mary.</p>
               <p>'Then I'll tell you,' was the frank reply; 'by wearing<pb n="144-145"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000073"/> paper-soled shoes, and getting my feet wet. Father
                  told me it would be so; but what he said went in at one ear and out at the other,
                  till I found myself down sick, and then I determined to be more careful in future.
                  Now, look there,' she continued, resting an exquisitely shaped little foot upon
                  the cross-piece of a chair, and displaying a stout pair of calf-skin shoes,
                  'that's the kind of foot-covering I intend to wear hereafter, when it threatens
                  rain, as it does at present.'</p>
               <p>'And very wise in you, too,' exclaimed Jack Ainslie; 'I do believe that one-half
                  the sickness young girls have comes from some imprudence in dressing, and I'm glad
                  to see there's one who isn't afraid to go contrary to the ideas of <emph>Mrs.
                     Fashion.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>'O, yes,' exclaimed Mary, affecting a tone of disdain, 'these men are always
                  preaching about women killing themselves by following the fashion. It's a pity
                  they don't alter some of their own fashions, for goodness knows there's need of
                  it!'</p>
               <p>'Now you shan't scold Mr. Ainslie for giving his opinion,' cried Minnie, in a
                  merry tone, 'for he's right. There's no doubt but what it would benefit the men
                  vastly to drop some of their bad habits; still two wrongs don't make a right, and
                  I'm for waging war against the errors of female dress. I've some idea of starting
                  an 'Anti-Light-Gaiter-and-Tight-Lacing Society,' and if I thought I should meet
                  with sufficient support, I'd do it; but, psha! there isn't a girl in New York,
                  hardly, who wouldn't have some severe remark to make about me if I should
                  undertake it.'</p>
               <p>'Gracious me!' exclaimed Mary, suddenly, 'why, what a forgetful, careless creature
                  I am! Here I've been talking all this time, and haven't introduced my cousin
                  Helen; better late than never, though. Miss Jay, this is Miss Wallace.'</p>
               <p>'I have often heard you speak of her,' said Minnie, advancing towards Helen, and
                  gently shaking her by the hand, 'and I am happy to make her acquaintance.'</p>
               <p>Helen acknowledged the compliment by a slight inclination of her head; and the
                  ceremony of introduction being over, the whole party were soon conversing
                  familiarly.</p>
               <p>'Dear me!' exclaimed Mary, during a short pause in the conversation, 'I forgot all
                  about the young lady in male attire! John was about telling us a beautiful story
                  just as you entered, Minnie.'</p>
               <p>'Then let him go on with it, by all means,' exclaimed Minnie, 'for, if there's
                  anything I'm fond of, it is an exciting story.'</p>
               <p>'Very sorry,' ladies, that I can't oblige you at present,' said Jack Ainslie,
                  reaching his hat, and preparing to start off—'the fact is, it's time I was on
                  duty—some other day I'll be happy to accommodate you, but business before
                  pleasure, you know.</p>
               <p>'O, yes, that's always the way!' said Mary Gardener, pettishly, 'you're never in a
                  hurry till a favor is asked of you, and then it's 'business before pleasure!''</p>
               <p>'That isn't so, is it, Molly?' said Jack, coaxingly, as he twirled one of her
                  bright ringlets around his fingers—'you don't mean that, I know you don't. Come,
                  don't be angry, that's a good girl,' and after a little more coaxing on the part
                  of Jack and a little more pouting on the part of Mary, the former disappeared,
                  followed by the latter, and just as the street-door closed upon the policeman's
                  retreating form, Minnie Jay declared she heard something very like a kiss
                  reverberate through the entry. Mary wouldn't own it, of course, but Minnie
                  insisted that she could not be mistaken in the sound, and as she had passed
                  through all the phases of courtship and was engaged at the time to be married,
                  there cannot be a doubt that she was right.</p>
               <p>'Now,' said Minnie, after Jack Ainslie had departed, 'I must be going, too, for
                  I'm hurried to death with work, and merely ran up to invite you to our house next
                  Monday night week—just two weeks from to-day. I shall be eighteen years old, if I
                  live to see it, and I intend to have a little company;<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000074"/> but I wouldn't take a bit of pleasure if you wasn't
                  there—will you come?'</p>
               <p>'I will try to,' replied Mary.</p>
               <p>'And will you bring your cousin with you?' interrogated Minnie, 'I hope you will
                  come, won't you, Miss Wallace?' she continued, turning to Helen.</p>
               <p>'I don't know that I shall be in the city,' replied Helen, 'but if I am, nothing
                  would give me more pleasure.'</p>
               <p>'O, do try to stay,' said Minnie, 'I think you would be pleased with our folks.
                  Father is full of fun, old as he is, and mother is never happy unless when
                  concocting some joke. Besides, there will be some young men there. Such nice young
                  fellow! One in particular, who wants me to introduce him to some young lady, and I
                  know you'll just suit him.'</p>
               <p>"I am not vain enough to suppose,' replied Helen, modestly, 'that I have any
                  attractions for a city beau, but even if I had, and should suit the gentleman you
                  allude to, it is not so certain that he would suit me, for I am somewhat
                  particular. However, I am sure I would be delighted with the old folks, and if I
                  do not have to go home before your birthday arrives I shall be very happy to take
                  part in celebrating it.'</p>
               <p>'Thank you,' said Minnie, cordially, 'I shall expect you, but 'if I am
                  disappointed, I must put up with it. Good-bye! good-bye, Mary—good-bye, Mrs.
                  Gardener!' and the merry-hearted girl departed.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <p>A FORTNIGHT rolled rapidly by, and as no summons had arrived from Helen's mother,
                  the young girl, as she had promised, accompanied her cousins and Jack Ainslie to
                  the house of Minnie Jay, early on the evening of that young lady's birth-day.</p>
               <p>Minnie had not over-praised her parents when speaking of them to Helen, who found
                  them all that she had represented them to be—a jovial, fond, entertaining old
                  couple, who thought the world of their daughter, and were only too anxious to
                  render every body happy who honored her natal anniversary with their presence. The
                  young country girl naturally had great veneration for old people, and was fond of
                  their society, especially when they were of a lively turn, and took pains to
                  please her, but she was not over-fond of mingling in mixed assemblages, nor could
                  she boast much experience in fashionable life. It was with a feeling of
                  reluctance, therefore, that after tea, she accompanied Minnie Jay and her cousins
                  to the drawing room, where a number of young ladies and gentlemen had already
                  assembled. Once there, however, she made herself sociable, and indulged freely in
                  the general conversation. She was a girl of an original and very fine mind, and
                  although she had not been liberally<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6405-00000075"/>
                  educated, yet she had read much, and was able to converse fluently upon almost any
                  subject that might be started, which fact did not long remain a secret, and she
                  was soon the centre of an admiring circle composed of both sexes. Although
                  belonging to what is called the poorer class of society, Mr. and Mrs. Jay had once
                  been in very comfortable circumstances, and although they were forced to allow
                  their daughter to work for a living, they had considerable pride, and felt when
                  they looked at her, that she was fit to be the bride of the most aristocratic. To
                  tell the truth, Minnie herself felt so—and not without reason, for among those who
                  honored her with a visit occasionally were a number of young men of some
                  pretensions, both as to wealth and breeding. Some of these sat around Helen while
                  she conversed, and although they could not lose sight of the fact that she was a
                  portionless girl, they had to acknowledge to themselves that she was a
                  particularly bright one.</p>
               <p>Everything passed off pleasantly to Helen till about ten o'clock, when she saw
                  Minnie beckoning to her from the other side of the room. She arose and went to
                  her, when the latter whispered—</p>
               <p>'<emph>He</emph> has come!'</p>
               <p>'Who has come?' asked Helen, with some surprise.</p>
               <p>'Why, Mr. Barker,' replied Minnie, 'the young gentleman I told you I wished to
                  introduce to you.'</p>
               <p>'I had much rather,' said Helen, 'you would not give me a direct introduction to
                  any one. It is enough that I am generally known by the company.'</p>
               <p>'Nonsense!' exclaimed Minnie, 'you are altogether too modest; you will surely die
                  an old maid unless you get rid of some of your queer notions.'</p>
               <p>'I expect to,' said Helen, with a smile, and she was about resuming the seat which
                  she had left, when the door near which they stood opened, and the individual of
                  whom Minnie had been talking entered.</p>
               <p>Helen cast her eyes upon the carpet, and, at the same time, the mischievous Minnie
                  beckoned to the newly arrived guest, and, as he approached her, she said—</p>
               <p>'Miss Wallace, allow me to introduce to you Mr. Barker.' Helen raised her eyes to
                  acknowledge the introduction, when they fell full upon the face of Bob Barker,
                  whom she had before seen as the patron of the infamous Mrs. Waffles. She
                  recognized him instantly, although he looked very different from what he did on
                  the occasion just referred to. He was perfectly sober, the style of his dress was
                  less flashy, and, in short, he looked more like a gentleman than he did at that
                  time. The introduction was so sudden that Helen came near uttering a cry of
                  affright, but she checked herself, although every drop of blood in her body seemed
                  to have found its way into her face, and then as suddenly retreated, leaving her
                  as cold and pale as sculptured marble, and trembling violently. She spoke not a
                  word, but turned abruptly from him, and sought a seat by the side of her
                  cousin.</p>
               <p>Her conduct surprised Minnie as much as it did Bob, who thought it exceedingly
                  strange, and remarked after she had left them—</p>
               <p>'I wonder what can be the matter, Miss Jay. There isn't anything particularly
                  frightful in my appearance this evening, is there? Or is the young lady taken
                  suddenly ill?'</p>
               <p>'O no,' replied Minnie, 'you look well enough, but the fact is, Miss Wallace,
                  although willing enough to converse when once the ice is broken, is rather
                  diffident at first. She only needs a skilful talker like yourself to draw her out,
                  after which you will not find her backward, I assure you.</p>
               <p>'If that is really the case,' replied Bob, 'she shall not complain that I did not
                  furnish her with material for conversation, for I will ply her with questions
                  which, if she does not answer from choice, common politeness will force her to
                  reply to,'—as he finished speaking, he took a seat by her side.</p>
               <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6405-00000076"/>
               <p>Minnie Jay knew nothing of the moral character of Robert Barker, or she would have
                  been less familiar with him her-self, as well as less anxious to introduce him to
                  a friend. She only knew him as a gay, thoughtless young man of the world, whose
                  father was quite wealthy, and whose society was rather agreeable than otherwise.
                  She expected his acquaintance with Helen would end upon that evening, and her
                  desire to introduce him arose more from a freak than anything else.</p>
               <p>Helen was satisfied in her own mind that Minnie was in ignorance as to the true
                  character of Barker, and therefore she did not blame her for introducing him, but
                  she heartily wished herself at home, and away from his presence, and a feeling of
                  sickness came over her as he seated himself at her side, and commenced a
                  conversation.</p>
               <p>She had made up her mind to treat him at first with apathetic indifference, and if
                  she could not chill him into silence, she then determined to resort to actual
                  rudeness—but Robert Barker was really, when himself, a fine-looking young fellow,
                  and, moreover, possessed many good qualities—bad associations had injured, but not
                  totally corrupted him, and, when in decent society, he not only knew how to
                  conduct himself, but he felt in all its force the superiority of virtue over vice.
                  He was not singular in this respect, for—alas, that the truth should have to be
                  spoken—there are a great many Robert Barkers in the world—more, in fact, than
                  honest people who mind their own business have any idea of.</p>
               <p>'Are you ill, Miss Wallace?' he inquired, in a tone of concern, and in a voice of
                  so much sweetness as to almost make Helen for the moment forget why she disliked
                  him. She made him no answer, however, and, after a moment of silence, he again
                  ventured to say, 'I see that you are not well—I will say as much to Miss Jay,' and
                  he was about rising, when she replied, after a hard struggle with her
                  feelings—</p>
               <p>'I beg you will not trouble yourself on my account, sir—I fear that Miss Jay could
                  render me but little assistance while you remain near me.'</p>
               <p>Bob was thunderstruck at this reply, and could not for the life of him think what
                  meaning to take from it. He was certain he had been guilty of no action to which
                  the most fastidious stickler for etiquette could take exceptions, and for an
                  instant he was almost inclined to doubt the sanity of the lady to whom he was
                  talking. When his surprise had somewhat abated, he managed to observe—</p>
               <p>'I scarcely know what to make of the remark just uttered by you, Miss Wallace—am I
                  to understand that my presence is disagreeable to you, even to sickness?'</p>
               <p>'Yes, sir,' she replied, but it was a hard task for her at say it—'that is just
                  exactly what I wish you to understand.'</p>
               <p>The blood mounted to Barker's cheeks, and an angry ex pression was upon his lips,
                  but he checked it, and said in a quiet, gentlemanly tone—</p>
               <p>'By some means I have been—though I do assure you, my dear young lady, most
                  unintentionally so—the cause of annoyance to you, and I sincerely regret it, but I
                  think I may be allowed to ask in all courtesy and without infringing any law of
                  good breeding, in what that annoyance consists. I trust you will answer this
                  interrogatory in all candor, and in the spirit in which it is put, for your reply
                  may, perhaps, keep me from offending in a like manner upon some future
                  occasion.'</p>
               <p>Had Robert Barker given expression to the hasty words which first arose to his
                  lips, Helen would have had no difficulty in choosing what course to pursue. She
                  would have got up and left him at once. But when he acted so much the part of a
                  gentleman, she could not find it in her heart to carry out her first resolution.
                  She therefore replied—</p>
               <p>'You ask no more than what is fair, sir, and I suppose I am bound to reply. I will
                  do so, but not now. You shall<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6405-00000077"/> hear from
                  me again, but at present suffice it to say that I have seen you before to-night,
                  and under very different circumstances. I wish you a very good evening, sir,' and
                  whispering to her cousins, (who had been closely engaged in conversation
                  themselves, and had not heard anything which passed between Bob and herself,) her
                  wish to retire, they sought out Minnie, and in spite of her strenuous endeavors to
                  keep them longer, they shortly afterwards departed for home.</p>
               <p>Bob Barker was intensely surprised as well as greatly annoyed at the singular
                  result of his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tete-a-tete</foreign> with Helen, and would
                  have given considerable to have had the riddle solved. He was certain he had never
                  seen the young lady before, and to tell the truth, he was greatly taken with her,
                  notwithstanding she had treated him so cavalierly. He had never met with a girl in
                  his life whose appearance so fascinated him, and at the same time inspired him
                  with so much respect. After she had departed, it seemed to him as though all the
                  beauty in the room had fled, and when he had endeavored, but all in vain, to
                  arrive at some conclusion concerning her in his own mind, he appealed to Minnie
                  Jay to know something of her history. All that Minnie could tell him, however, was
                  that she was a young lady on a visit from the country—that she had never been in
                  the city but once before in her life, and then only for a short time, and that she
                  was likely to remain but a short time then.</p>
               <p>This account only served to render the matter more obscure than ever, and after an
                  evening of the most restless anxiety, Robert Barker went home to dream of his
                  mysterious enchantress.</p>
               <p>The clock struck twelve just as Helen and her cousins, together with Jack Ainslie,
                  reached home, and as Thomas Gardener was about inserting his latch key in the
                  key-hole of the street door, a dark object resting in the shadow of the porch
                  attracted his observation, and stooping to ascertain what it was, he picked up a
                  basket, containing something neatly covered with a dark-colored quilt.</p>
               <p>'Hello! What's this?' he exclaimed, as he displayed it to view.</p>
               <p>'I'll bet it's a baby!' cried Jack, who had often been called upon to carry such
                  little unfortunates to the Alms House;—and scarcely had he ventured the
                  suggestion, when a feeble wail from underneath the coverlid gave unmistakeable
                  evidence that he was right.</p>
               <p>'Let's take it in and see what it looks like,' said Thomas Gardener, and placing
                  the basket carefully upon his arm, the whole party entered the house, and with the
                  aid of a bright light proceeded to examine their prize.</p>
               <p>'Dear, deal! what a beautiful little creature!' exclaimed Mrs. Gardener, who was
                  the first to remove the covering from the babe—'why I declare it's wide
                  awake!'</p>
               <p>'So it is!' chimed in Mary, 'and what great bright eyes it has! O, mother, let me
                  take it,' and as she spoke she raised it from the basket, and began chiruping to
                  it.</p>
               <p>'That's no poor person's baby,' remarked jack Ainslie, whose critical eyes bad at
                  once caught sight of the trinkets which adorned its arms—'see how splendidly it's
                  dressed!'</p>
               <p>And then commenced a kissing time, such as we fear is seldom witnessed in the
                  nurseries of the rich. The girls did not stop to examine its dress. It mattered
                  little to them whether it was the offspring of rich or poor parents. It was a
                  baby—a pretty one, too—and that was enough for them to know. Mary kissed it again
                  and again—then it was taken from her by Helen, who in her turn caressed it
                  fondly—then it again fell into the hands of Mrs. Gardener, who made as much of it
                  as though it were her own—and lastly the youth Thomas took it, but being rather
                  clumsy in handling such subjects, he caused it to cry out with pain, and instantly
                  there was a chorus of sympathetic "O-o-o-'s!" from the women folks which caused
                  the incautious boy to regret that he had<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6405-00000078"
                  /> been imprudent enough to meddle with such dangerous pro-perty.</p>
               <p>While this was being enacted, Jack Ainslie, who for the moment had lost sight of
                  the baby in his love for his profession, was searching the basket; and just as the
                  infant began to cry, he exclaimed—</p>
               <p>'Hello! what's this? Here's a note and a package. Let's see what the note says!'
                  and unfolding it he read as follows:</p>

                           <p>"MRS. GARDENER—<hi rend="i"/>Dear Madam—The person who leaves this
                              child at your door is not unacquainted with you, although you have
                              doubtless lost all recollection of her. She knows you to be a kind and
                              affectionate woman, and is certain you will take good care of it. You
                              need not be ashamed to take charge of it, for it was born in wedlock;
                              and some day perhaps you may learn its history. At present if you wish
                              to keep it from the grasp of a villain, please make no enquiry
                              concerning it, but if you can, remove it at once from the city, and
                              place it under the protection of some one in whom you have confidence
                              in the country. In the package accompanying the basket you will find
                              three hundred dollars in bank notes, and when this is exhausted you
                              will receive more. The child's name is Rudolph Graham, and at a future
                              time, when circumstances will permit, it may be claimed by its
                              mother,</p>

               <p>Here was a mystery which puzzled the honest Mrs. Gardener not a little. Who
                     <emph>could</emph> the mother of the child be? She had never known any Julia
                  Graham, or any Julia at all for that matter, although she concluded, on a second
                  thought, that the name was an assumed one, and after some time spent in useless
                  imaginings, she determined to comply with the wishes expressed in the note, and it
                  was finally agreed that Helen should take the babe home with her when she
                  departed.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <p>ON the day succeeding the events just detailed, George Cantwell and Sam Slocumb
                  sat in one of the private boxes of a well-known Broadway restaurant indulging in
                  fried oysters and champagne, and at the same time carrying on, in an under tone, a
                  conversation of a very interesting character.</p>
               <p>'I don't give you this information for money alone,' said Cantwell, as he sat down
                  a glass which he had just emptied, 'if that was my dodge I could make more out of
                  Emory himself, for he'd come down liberally to know where they are—but that's just
                  the reason I won't tell him. I hate him, and will lose no chance of injuring him,
                  when I can do so with safety. Money is a necessity and is very acceptable at all
                  times, but revenge is a luxury which I cannot often enjoy, and therefore it is
                  doubly precious to me when I do obtain a slice of it.'</p>
               <p>'Did you not say,' remarked Sam, 'that her elder sister was poisoned?'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' replied Cantwell, 'but not purposely—the dose was not intended for her, but
                  for Emory, though he, from some motive of his own, kept that fact concealed, and
                  testified upon the inquest that he himself had poisoned the wine—that he had
                  prepared it for some chemical purpose. The jury believed his story, and rendered a
                  verdict of accidental poisoning, but<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6405-00000079"/> I
                  am certain the dose was fixed for him, although it would be impossible for me to
                  prove it. But when was ever a truth developed, if he wished it kept secret, and
                  when was it ever kept secret if he wished it known? Curse him! O, if I could but
                  once get him in my power, how I would make him groan!'</p>
               <p>'What led you to suppose that they intended to abscond?' enquired Slocumb.</p>
               <p>'When it is my interest to be wide awake,' answered Cantwell, 'I generally have my
                  eyes and ears continually about me. I noticed on a number of occasions, when
                  business called me to ——, that Emory's wife and the servant girl were absent at
                  the same time. No one else seemed to observe the fact, and I don't know that I
                  should have paid any particular attention to it, if I had not once or twice caught
                  them coming together from Kate's room. This led me to suppose, however, that they
                  had gone there to talk over some matter of a private nature, and in the morning of
                  the night on which they escaped I was fortunate enough to catch sight of them just
                  as they entered the apartment alluded to, and made bold to post myself at the door
                  and listen. I did not overhear all which they had to say, but I heard enough to
                  satisfy me that they intended to take their departure that night, so I watched
                  them, followed them to the city, and traced them to the house where they are at
                  present stopping. I was certain you would give considerable to know where Estelle
                  was (why I was thus certain I will not tell you) and I have found you out, given
                  you the information, and you must make the most of it.'</p>
               <p>'Do you think I will have much difficulty in moulding her to my wishes?' asked
                  Slocumb, anxiously.</p>
               <p>'I don't know,' replied Cantwell, 'she's a queer piece, and you may have trouble
                  with her. I don't believe you could do anything with her by coaxing, for she has
                  become so used to the snarling of her husband, that I dare say she'll feel lost
                  without it. You may frighten her into some concession. Threaten her and the girl
                  both with an arrest on a charge of murder. I think there is no doubt but what this
                  will fetch her. At all events I can do no more for you, and you must trust to your
                  own wit for the rest.'</p>
               <p>'I will follow her to the end of the world, but what I will accomplish my ends!'
                  exclaimed Slocumb, determinedly, 'it will be such a triumph! such an achievement
                  to boast of to Bob Barker! He laughed at me when I ventured to predict it—now
                  let's see if I can't laugh at him!'</p>
               <p>'It will be as much my triumph as yours,' said Cantwell, gleefully, 'for if you
                  can succeed in making her your mistress, I shall be the first one to convey the
                  intelligence to Emory, and O, how it will wring his proud heart! Not that he loves
                  her, at all, but then she is his <emph>wife,</emph> and there's where the shoe
                  will pinch. I know him—every point about him—I could drive him crazy by carrying
                  to him such a piece of information, and detailing it as I can detail it!'</p>
               <p>'Here's that we may both be successful!' said Slocumb, as he raised a glass of
                  wine to his lips, and drained it to the bottom, 'and now I will set about my
                  conquest at once.' He rang the bell as he spoke, and the waiter appearing, he
                  settled the bill, and he and Cantwell sallied forth.</p>
               <p>'Here we part,' said the latter when they reached the sidewalk, 'and if you should
                  not see me again in the course of a day or two you will drop me a line, will you,
                  and let me know how you get on?'</p>
               <p>'By all means,' answered Slocumb, and they parted, each taking a different
                  direction.</p>
               <p>Slocumb's course lay up Broadway, and as he walked leisurely along, maturing his
                  plans and thinking over the surprise which he would give his friend Bob Barker
                  after he had completed his conquest, who should he meet but that identical
                  individual, who with careworn countenance and downcast eyes was plodding moodily
                  along.</p>
               <p>'Ah, Bob!' exclaimed Sam, as he extended his hand, 'glad to see you! But
                  grave-stones and empty brain-pans! how<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6405-00000080"/>
                  down in the mouth you look! Why, what's the matter with you, old boy? Come and
                  take a cocktail, just to wake yourself up a bit.'</p>
               <p>'No, I'm obliged to you, Sam,' was the reply of the youth, in a sad tone of voice,
                  'but I'd rather be excused.'</p>
               <p>'Well, there!' cried Sam, affecting surprise, 'I never knew you to refuse a drink
                  before! what's going to happen!'</p>
               <p>'I don't think I shall drink as much hereafter as I've been in the habit of
                  drinking,' said Bob, in the same melancholy tone which he had before used.</p>
               <p>'Why, what <emph>has</emph> come over you, old fellow?' cried Sam, at the same
                  time slapping his companion familiarly upon the shoulder, 'you hav'n't been to
                  class-meeting, have you?'</p>
               <p>'No,' was the reply, 'but I've been thinking seriously lately, that——'</p>
               <p>'Psha!' cried Sam, 'where's the use in thinking seriously? Just come in with me
                  and take a drink, and I'll tell you all about a grass widow I'm going to chase
                  up.'</p>
               <p>'I don't wish to hear it,' replied Robert Barker, decisively, 'I've paid too much
                  attention to such subjects already, and to tell you the truth, Sam, my views of
                  propriety have changed immensely within the last forty-eight hours!'</p>
               <p>'Ha! ha!' laughed Slocumb, 'you ain't going to turn parson, are you?'</p>
               <p>'I might embrace a more objectionable calling,' replied Bob, 'but I do not expect
                  to take out clerical orders, nor is it my intention to preach a sermon on the
                  present occasion. I only wish to say that my views concerning certain matters have
                  totally changed, and that unless you alter as I have done, henceforth we are no
                  fit companions for each other.'</p>
               <p>Sam was so utterly astonished that he looked sharply at his friend, in the hope of
                  discovering some sign of merriment in his countenance. He saw none, however, so he
                  asked, with mock gravity—</p>
               <p>'And may I be allowed to enquire what miracle has wrought this important change in
                  your character in so short a time?'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' replied Bob, 'and I will tell you. After I have done so, I know you will
                  laugh at me, but it is my desire that you should know what has caused me to alter,
                  for the knowledge may possibly prove of service to you hereafter. The miracle,
                  then, which I trust has worked a reformation in me, is <emph>a virtuous
                     girl.'</emph>
               </p>
               <p>'Ha! ha! ha!' again gleefully shouted Slocumb, 'that is a <emph>miracle</emph>
                  indeed! Well, I wish you joy of your regeneration, and I'm sorry I ain't a fit
                  subject for the same process—but I ain't—and so if you won't take a drink I must
                  bid you good morning, for pleasure calls and I must obey.'</p>
               <p>'Good morning, then,' was the sorrowful reply of Bob, as he re-commenced his walk,
                  and an Eighth Avenue stage hap- pening to pass at the time, Slocumb beckoned to
                  the driver, jumped in, and as he took his seat he muttered to himself—</p>
               <p>'Well, he's a fit subject for the Lunatic Asylum—<emph>he</emph> is! The idea of a
                  young fellow allowing any woman to gain such an influence as that over him!
                  Preposterous!'</p>
               <p>When the stage had got pretty well up the Eighth Avenue, Slocumb pulled the string
                  and got out. He then took a small slip of paper from his pocket, and looking at
                  it, he said to himself, 'If the direction's the right one, the house must be
                  somewhere in this neighborhood.' While he was looking around, a woman came out of
                  a grocery store near at hand, and passed rapidly by him. She held her head down,
                  and a large hood nearly concealed her features from view, but Sam easily
                  recognised from her peculiar gait, the person of Kate O'Donnell. Stepping off
                  quickly in pursuit, he caught up her, and touching her upon the shoulder, he
                  remarked—</p>
               <p>'I suppose you thought you had fooled me nicely, didn't Kate? For the last three
                  months I have been feeing you liberally in ——, to keep me posted up in family
                  affairs there, and the first thing I hear is that your lovely mistress<pb
                     n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6405-00000081"/> and yourself have taken French leave,
                  and located yourselves here in New York. That wasn't hardly honest, my Celtic
                  beauty. You should at least have given me a hint as to how the cat was about to
                  jump.'</p>
               <p>Kate was taken all aback at the sudden appearance of Slocumb, whom she had indeed
                  swindled extensively by keeping him entirely in the dark, and at the same time
                  taking his money for information which she manufactured to suit. At first she was
                  about to run away from him, but noticing that he kept a close watch upon her, she
                  altered her mind, and inquired, with an air of innocence—</p>
               <p>'Who tould ye the misthress was in New York?'</p>
               <p>'Come, come, Kate,' said Slocumb, somewhat impatiently, f it's useless for you to
                  try to pull the wool over my eyes—you've fooled me once, and that was my
                  misfortune, but if you do it again it will be my fault. I know Mrs. Emory is
                  here—that she lives on this street, and that you are living with her. I had my
                  information from a direct source, and there can be no mistake about it.'</p>
               <p>'A direct source, is it?' said Kate, when she saw concealment was longer useless,
                  'thin it must have bin from the divil you had it, for sorra a mortial saw us come
                  away. But fhat d'ye want wid the misthress, anyhow?'</p>
               <p>'I wish to see her,' was the laconic reply.</p>
               <p>'Well, thin upon me word and credit,' said Kate, she doesn't wish to see you, I
                  know. Sure, you niver had any acquaintance wid her.'</p>
               <p>'I know it,' answered Slocumb, 'but I intend to have, so you may as well take me
                  to the house, and announce me at once.'</p>
               <p>'Well, thin, I'll not do it,' answered Kate, doggedly, 'for she doesn't want to
                  see you,' and she was about passing along, when Slocumb caught her by the arm, and
                  bending his head he whispered in her ear—</p>
               <p>'I suppose she'd rather see me, bound on a mission of love, than to see a
                  policeman, bound on a mission of justice, wouldn't she?'</p>
               <p>'Hush-h-h!' said Kate, laying her finger upon her lip, 'come alone—I'll take you
                  there, but you must let me go in first.'</p>
               <p>'Very well,' answered Slocumb, 'but, mind, no tricks—I've followed the game up
                  successfully, so far, and I won't lose it now without satisfaction—do you
                  understand?'</p>
               <p>'I do!' said Kate, and she led the way to a neat two story brick-house, closely
                  followed by Slocumb.</p>
               <p>She left Slocumb standing on the steps, and entered; but had not been gone long
                  when she returned, and conducted him up a flight of stairs, and into a neatly
                  furnished parlor, where sat Estelle, pale as a corpse, and her face bearing
                  evident traces of severe suffering. As soon as Kate had ushered him into the
                  apartment she disappeared, and left him standing with his hat in his hand at a
                  loss how to commence a conversation under such peculiar circumstances. Estelle
                  waited a reasonable time, and as he did not open his lips, but stood gazing
                  intensely upon her, she broke the silence by enquiring, in a voice weak from
                  illness—</p>
               <p>'Well, sir, my servant informed me a moment since, that you was anxious for an
                  interview. To what am I indebted for the honor of this visit?'</p>
               <p>As soon as he heard her voice the embarrassment of Slocumb departed, and his
                  natural impudence came to his relief, so drawing a chair up alongside of her, he
                  replied, in a voice full of passion—</p>
               <p>'To Love, Madam—to Love, you are indebted for this visit—Love, who occasionally
                  causes his victims to forget what is due to propriety, etiquette—everything—which,
                  I fear, you will think is the case in the present instance.'</p>
               <p>'Why, sir,' replied Estelle, with apparent surprise, 'I do not recollect ever to
                  have seen you before.'</p>
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6405-00000082"/>
               <p>'No,' answered Slocumb, endeavoring to take her hand, 'but I have seen you. I saw
                  you at the altar on the day of your marriage, and at that moment a passion took
                  possession of me which has been consuming me ever since. By day and by night I
                  have thought of you—never for a moment have you been absent from my imagination,
                  and when I heard that you had fled from the roof of your legal tyrant, I
                  determined, if possible, to seek you out, and lay my heart open before you. I have
                  done so, and I now tremblingly await your reply.'</p>
               <p>'Our interview need not be a lengthy one, then,' answered Estelle, 'for this is my
                  reply. I long since gave my affections to the only being for whom I can ever feel
                  a particle of love. He slighted my love, it is true, but his conduct has not
                  rendered it less ardent, although it can never meet with a return. After this
                  confession, sir, I hope you will see the propriety of endeavoring to check the
                  unhappy passion which has taken possession of you, and of leaving me to pursue my
                  journey through life unmolested.'</p>
               <p>'That is impossible!' cried Slocumb, 'if you do not look with compassion upon me,
                  death will be the result of your coldness. For twelve long, weary months, I have
                  watched for, prayed for, this blissful moment, and now that the cup of happiness
                  is at my lips, I cannot consent that it should be dashed ruthlessly aside. You can
                  better school yourself to love me than I can school myself to forget my love.'</p>
               <p>'But you forget, sir,' said Estelle, 'that I am married and undivorced.'</p>
               <p>'A mockery! a mockery!' cried Slocumb, energetically, 'such a marriage is not
                  recognised in the courts of love.'</p>
               <p>'And would not the relation of husband and wife between you and me amount to the
                  same thing?' said Estelle, 'when I do not, and cannot love you?'</p>
               <p>'O, no,' exclaimed Slocumb, with warmth, 'for my feelings are better calculated to
                  mingle harmoniously with yours, than were those of the cold, formal, passionless
                  Emory!' and as he finished the sentence, before she was aware of his intention he
                  caught her around the neck and imprinted a libidinous kiss upon her lips.</p>
               <p>A look of desperate rage gleamed in the black orbs of Estelle, as she tore herself
                  from the embrace of the unprincipled youth, and cast upon him a look of withering
                  scorn. Her heart had been swelling with indignation all along, but she repressed
                  it, for she knew, from what Kate had said to her, that she was in his power, and
                  she wished to get along with him as easily as possible—when, however, his conduct
                  broke out into an act of rudeness, she could no longer command herself, and she
                  exclaimed in a voice of fearful passion—</p>
               <p>'Begone! you mean, paltry villain. Leave this room instantly, or I will have you
                  thrown from the window headlong!'</p>
               <p>'<emph>Will</emph> you?' exclaimed Slocumb, emphatically; 'well, that would be
                  imprudent to say the least, for if the fall did not happen to kill me, I might be
                  able to tell a story which would look horrible in print. It is a terrible crime
                  for one sister to poison another—and yet it is sometimes done, although the deed
                  may be twisted by a coroner's jury into an accident, by the suppression of
                  evidence. If I were able now, to put a witness on the stand who was willing to
                  swear to having overheard a plot for the murder of a husband, it would be a fair
                  inference that poison was prepared for him, though he might by accident have
                  escaped it, and by accident also a sister may have drank it.</p>
               <p>It was evident to Estelle that however Slocumb may have come in possession of it,
                  he had a truer knowledge of the full extent of her guilt than she had supposed
                  existed outside her own bosom or that of Kate O'Donnell, and she stood rooted to
                  the floor, her lips slightly parted, her eyes staring wildly, and her breast
                  heaving tumultuously, as she gazed upon him.<pb n="164-165"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000083"/> Tears at last came to her relief, and sinking into
                  a chair, she exclaimed imploringly—</p>
               <p>'Oh, sir, have pity on me! I am a wretched, miserable creature, bowed to the dust
                  by guilt, and shame, and sorrow—my punishment is great already—despair has driven
                  me almost wild—let this suffice, and do not take advantage of the terrible secret
                  which you possess to plunge me still further into the abyss of infamy and
                  woe!'</p>
               <p>'I havn't said anything about infamy and woe,' replied Slocumb, while a smile of
                  satisfaction played round the corners of his mouth, 'I talked only of joy and
                  happiness, upon which you are pleased to put a false face. Do as I wish you to,
                  and you shall have no cause to regret it—refuse me, and you know the consequences.
                  I can't afford to lay out my time and money without some return.'</p>
               <p>Estelle was calm again almost instantly, and an air of settled determination
                  rested upon her features as she muttered to herself, '<emph>I'll do it!</emph>'
                  Then turning to Slocumb, she said, with an effort at composure—</p>
               <p>'Perhaps I am foolish in regarding your suit in so serious a light, but it is at
                  least a delicate matter, and I trust you will give me till to-night to think of
                  it?'</p>
               <p>'Oh, by all means,' answered Slocumb, scarcely able to contain himself for the joy
                  that filled him—'nothing can be fairer than that, and now that we understand each
                  other, I will take my leave.' He placed his hat upon his head and advanced towards
                  the door. As he reached it, he turned again, and remarked—'I don't wish to appear
                  too particular, but you must excuse me if I remark that it will be useless for you
                  to attempt to escape between this time and evening, for I shall place a watch upon
                  the house.'</p>
               <p>'Rest perfectly easy on that score,' replied Estelle, 'I will not attempt to
                  escape. I have made up my mind to receive you here to-night, and I will do it—let
                  it, if you please, be about ten o'clock. I shall not be prepared for you before
                  that hour.'</p>
               <p>'As you please,' replied Slocumb, 'ten o'clock it is—so farewell till then.'</p>
               <p>He departed, and as soon as the door had fairly closed upon him, a diabolical look
                  settled upon the features of Estelle, and she rang the bell for Kate O'Donnell,
                  who soon afterwards made her appearance.</p>
               <p>'Is he comin' back agin the night?' asked Kate, looking steadily at her
                  mistress.</p>
               <p>'Yes, Kate,' answered Estelle, 'he is coming back to-night, and he will stay here
                  too—not only to-night, but for many nights after—he will <emph>never leave here
                     alive,</emph> Kate!' and her eyes sparkled with maniac wildness as she
                  spoke.</p>
               <p>'Is there no way to put him off?' asked Kate.</p>
               <p>'None,' replied Estelle, 'he is a beast, Kate!—worse than a beast—he has no
                  feeling—I implored his pity—I appealed to his generosity—but he had neither, and
                  he shall die! He threatened to give us both up on a charge of murder!'</p>
               <p>'Did he?' cried Kate, catching a portion of the rage which gleamed in the eyes of
                  her mistress; 'then he ought to die, for sure no wan should be charged wid murdher
                  for thryin' to take the life iv sich a baste as yer husband. It's glad society
                  should be to get rid of him.'</p>
               <p>'We must make a sure job of it this time,' said Estelle, savagely—'since we have
                  embarked in the trade of murder, we should learn to do our business properly. How
                  shall we kill him, Kate?' and the insane light which gleamed in her eyes, as she
                  coolly asked the monstrous question, showed that her mind was temporarily
                  unsettled.</p>
               <p>'I don't know,' answered Kate, who seemed to be a mere machine, under the
                  influence of Estelle—'wouldn't the pisin do?'</p>
               <p>'That will do if we can't think of anything better,' answered Estelle, 'but I
                  don't want to use it if I can help it—it isn't<pb n="166-167"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000084"/> so sure—besides it's a tell-tale—I want some safer
                  means.' She thought for a moment, and then continued, 'Never mind, we have some
                  hours to prepare for him, and I am determined he shall have a reception such as he
                  deserves. In the mean time, Kate, get everything in readiness to start to-morrow.
                  Our baggage is all on board, is it not?'</p>
               <p>It is,' answered Kate.</p>
               <p>'Then complete whatever business is yet unfinished,' said Estelle, 'and leave me
                  to study out a plan for the easy rest of my most honorable lover.'</p>
               <p>Kate disappeared and went about her work, while Estelle, as soon as she was left
                  alone, began pacing with hasty strides up and down the room.</p>
               <p>'Why should I hesitate to do it,' she muttered—'he would dishonor me—nay, he would
                  hang me, even—he possesses the power to do it, and I shall only be acting in
                  self-defence. I'll do it—I'll do it—I'll do it!'</p>
               <p>Again she sat down and attempted to compose herself. She found that impossible,
                  however, and jumping up she flew down stairs, as though pursued by some desperate
                  enemy, and spoke a few words to Kate—then she rushed back again, and approached a
                  closet, and taking down a bottle and a wine glass she swallowed half-a-dozen
                  glasses of wine in rapid succession. Again she wandered up and down in moody
                  distraction, and all that long afternoon and evening, she moved restlessly about
                  from room to room, like a guilty spirit seeking an escape from Tophet.</p>
               <p>At length the city clocks told the hour of ten, and shortly afterwards a ring was
                  heard at the door bell. A few hurried words in whispers passed between Estelle and
                  Kate in the entry above, and then the latter proceeded to the door.</p>
               <p>'Is it you, Misther Slocumb?' she enquired in a whisper.</p>
               <p>'Yes, yes!' was the impatient answer, 'open the door quickly, for it's beginning
                  to rain like the devil.'</p>
               <p>'I'm sorry I can't let ye in this way,' answered Kate, 'but the lock iv the
                  sthreet dure is out iv ordher, an' ye'll have to go up the next alley-way an'
                  climb over the fince—meself'll be there, an' show you where to jump over.'</p>
               <p>'Very well,' said Slocumb, 'if I must I suppose I must,' and following Kate's
                  direction he took his way up the alley leading between the two houses. It was a
                  dark night, and he had to grope his way to the fence, which he found easily, and
                  as he reached it, Kate addressed him from the other side.</p>
               <p>'Don't make more noise nor you can hilp,' she said, 'in climbin'. Here's the
                  place—here jist, where I'm tappin' wid me fisht. There, that's right,' she
                  continued, as his head appeared just above her—'now jump clear iv the fince, for
                  they are jist afther paintin' it on this side, an' ye'll shpoil yer clothes.'</p>
               <p>As she finished speaking, he jumped, but it was his last jump on earth, for
                  instead of landing upon the solid ground, as was his expectation, an open cistern,
                  just beneath the fence yawned to receive him, and in he went in eight feet of
                  water, and without a straw to catch at. One sudden, desperate cry of agony escaped
                  the poor wretch, and the next moment the cover of the cistern was closed, and he
                  was left struggling in the treacherous element. It was a terrible death to die
                  there in that dark, dismal, noisome place, and the guilty but unfortunate youth
                  straggled desperately with the grim tyrant. A moment before he had been full of
                  buoyant life, and was intent only upon the gratification of his unholy
                  passions—now he was in the very jaws of death, and yet with all his senses
                  perfectly acute. He knew that he was soon to appear before an offended Deity with
                  all his imperfections on his head—that he must die in that stifling pest-hole
                  where his body would bloat and rot before it would be found—if indeed it was ever
                  found by his friends, who might never know of his unhappy fate. Horrible thought!
                  He screamed in his agony till he was hoarse, but the dull echo of his own voice
                  mocked him.<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6405-00000085"/> He dug his nails into the
                  slimy, worm-eaten sides of the cistern till they were torn off at the roots. When
                  his strength was almost exhausted, and he had no longer breath left to shout, the
                  recollection of every wicked deed of which he had ever been guilty came rushing
                  into his mind. A sweet face with mild blue eyes seemed to gaze tearfully upon him
                  through the dense gloom above him, and immediately his conversation with Bob
                  Barker but a few hours previously occurred to him. Poor Isabel! She, too, had died
                  by drowning—she had <q>
                     <l>"Rashly importunate gone to her death,"</l>
                  </q> because he had betrayed her. Suddenly her countenance disappeared, and its
                  place was supplied by a whole host of hideous, grinning faces which seemed to mock
                  at his misery. Then the last feeble hold of his finger ends upon the rotten boards
                  gave way—his strength totally deserted him, and as he essayed to give one last
                  despairing shout for mercy to heaven, the water rushed into his mouth, and he sank
                  to the bottom—again he arose, and again the water drove back the prayer which he
                  would have uttered—then he lost his recollection, and finally sunk stark and cold
                  to the bottom—a few bubbles arose above his corpse—then all was still and calm as
                  before, and a guilty soul was with its maker.</p>
               <p>The next morning Estelle, under the name of Julia Graham, and Kate O'Donnell, who
                  assumed the name of Margaret Doyle, took passage for New Orleans.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
               <p>ON the morning succeeding the party at Minnie Jay's, Robert Barker, who had been
                  unable to sleep all night for thinking of the mysterious and painful circumstances
                  which had occurred, took his way to the dwelling of the young lady just mentioned
                  in the hope of hearing something which might tend to somewhat mitigate the awful
                  suspense under which he was laboring.</p>
               <p>It was about 11 o'clock when he reached the house, and what was his surprise and
                  gratification, on being shown into the parlor of Minnie, to find the object of his
                  anxious thoughts there before him. Helen Wallace was seated there, with her bonnet
                  on, having but that moment arrived.</p>
               <p>'Good morning, Miss Wallace!' was his cordial greeeting. She colored deeply and
                  bowed stiffly in reply to the salutation, but said nothing.</p>
               <p>'I am rejoiced to find you here,' he continued, 'inasmuch as I trust you will now
                  remove the load of anxiety which has oppressed me since I parted from you last
                  night.'</p>
               <p>'I cannot say I partake of the pleasure which you say this meeting gives you,'
                  replied Helen, 'I had hoped that I should see you again, and if I had dreamed of
                  meeting you here<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6405-00000086"/> this morning I should
                  certainly have sent the letter which I intended for you, and not brought it
                  myself. Since we have met, however, I will myself deliver it. Here it is'—she took
                  from her bosom a letter which she handed him and then continued—'It contains all
                  which it is necessary I should say, and now trusting that we may never again cross
                  each other's path, I will wish you a very good morning!'</p>
               <p>They were alone, for Minnie had left the room at the call of her mother, just as
                  Robert Barker entered, and the young man, casting upon Helen a look of mingled
                  pain and admiration, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>'Let me beseech you, Miss Wallace, not to leave me thus. Let me hear from your own
                  lips why I, who never knowingly injured you, have incurred your deep
                  displeasure.'</p>
               <p>'The letter will tell you that,' was the reply, 'you may learn it at your leisure
                  after I am gone.'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' answered Robert Barker, earnestly, 'but if this is not all a
                  misapprehension, and you really have ground of complaint against me, I may have
                  some defence to make—I may be able to offer something in extenuation of my
                  conduct—the letter cannot hear <emph>that,</emph> and I shall be forced to suffer
                  unjustly in your estimation—Miss Wallace,' he continued imploringly, 'you have set
                  my heart upon the rack, and it is but simple justice which I ask at your hands.
                  The meanest criminal has a right to a hearing before condemnation, and I ask no
                  more.'</p>
               <p>Helen paused, and after a moment of deep thought she replied—</p>
               <p>'Though your argument might hold good in law, Mr. Barker, I fear that it will
                  avail but little in this affair. However, as you desire it, perhaps it would be as
                  well for me to hear what can possibly be urged in defence of such conduct as that
                  of which you have, to my knowledge, been guilty, and in order faily to get at the
                  matter, let us suppose a case. But before proceeding further I must exact from you
                  a solemn promise that you will never report what passes between us.</p>
               <p>'I never will,' replied Barker, fervently, 'so help me heaven!'</p>
               <p>'Enough,' answered Helen, 'I will take your word,—and now let us suppose that an
                  honorable, pure-minded woman has been deprived by death of her only protector in
                  life—the husband of her heart, whose bosom has pillowed her head, and whose strong
                  arms and willing hands have shielded her against the assaults of bitter, crushing
                  poverty—let us suppose that after his death she is forced to struggle with the
                  cold, pitiless world, to support and bring up in the paths of rectitude and virtue
                  an only daughter, whom she regards as the apple of her eye—the sole solace in her
                  painful bereavement—the prop and stay of her old age—the darling idol whom she
                  regards as next only to Deity—let us further suppose that a couple of lost beings
                  who own no accountability to God, approach this sorrow-stricken widow in the garb
                  of Christianity, and by a hypocritical show of piety work upon her unsuspecting
                  nature, till they prevail upon her to allow the daughter so loved to accompany
                  them to a city filled with crime and misery, where they promise to advance her in
                  life, and fit her to occupy a more elevated station, so that she may by the
                  exercises of her heart and mind free her mother from all poverty, and care, and
                  trouble—suppose that instead of acting in good faith, they place the daughter when
                  fairly in their power in a den of infamy too horrible to name, where they intend
                  to make her the victim of some wealthy and soulless sensualist, who after having
                  wrecked her soul and body, will send her headlong on the road to ruin, despair and
                  death—what, tell me,' said Helen, pausing for an instant, and fixing her
                  brilliant, soul-lit eyes full upon the face of the man she was addressing, 'what
                  would <emph>you</emph> think, not only of the procurers in such a case, but of the
                  man who employed them in the base business?'</p>
               <p>'I should think,' answered Barker, in a tone of indignation,<pb n="172-173"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000087"/> 'that they were the vilest wretches the sun ever
                  shone upon, and that the severest punishment the law could bestow, would be
                  inadequate to their crime.'</p>
               <p>'And suppose,' resumed Helen, 'that pending the arrival of the base man who was to
                  purchase the unfortunate and unsuspecting victim, another person of a like nature,
                  though perhaps not so deeply dyed in sin, should step in and try to outbid the
                  original purchaser—what would be your opinion of him?'</p>
               <p>Instantly the conversation which Bob had taken part in at the house of Mrs.
                  Waffles occurred to him, and the conviction forced itself upon his mind that it
                  was to him Helen alluded, although he could not imagine where she had obtained her
                  information. He strove to answer the last interrogatory which she had put to him,
                  but he could not do so. He was not so bad a man as Helen evidently thought he was,
                  and he wished to assure her of that fact, but he knew not how to do it, for he
                  could not deny that he had persuaded the infamous panders to vice alluded to, to
                  introduce him to a female beneath their roof, (although he knew not who she was or
                  how she came there) and conscious guilt caused his tongue to cleave to the roof of
                  his mouth, and rendered him dumb.</p>
               <p>'Man, man,' cried Helen, raising her voice, and casting upon Barker a look which
                  cut him to the soul, 'your silence condemns you! Right well you know that I have
                  been indulging in no fancy sketch—that all which I have stated actually did
                  happen—but you are not aware of a fact which I am now about to impart, namely,
                  that I, Helen Wallace, was the daughter of that grief-stricken widow—the prisoner
                  in that den of sin whom you so much wished to see—but, thank Heaven, I escaped the
                  toils that were set for me! He who always hears the orphan's prayer, lent a
                  pitying ear to my petition, and delivered me from the hands of my enemies! And
                  now, farewell! I have given you the explanation you required, and I trust the
                  recollection of this scene may make it lasting impression sion upon you, and cause
                  you to leave the unrighteous path which you have hitherto trod. Seek forgiveness
                  of God for the many sins which you have committed, and you may yet experience that
                  sweet relief which an altered heart is sure to bring with it. For myself, I freely
                  forgive you for the injury which you would have done me, and I will not expose you
                  so long as any signs of amendment appear—but if I should find it necessary to take
                  such a course, to save a friend from peril, I shall not scruple to unmask you.
                  Farewell for ever!'</p>
               <p>She was about leaving the room, when Robert Barker, with tearful eyes and choking
                  utterance, called upon her to stay. He sprang towards her, and would have caught
                  her by the hand, but she recoiled from him, and, waving him off, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>'Touch me not! I have forgiven you, 'tis true, but make not that an excuse for
                  insulting me!'</p>
               <p>'It is fit that you should loathe me!' exclaimed Barker—'fit that you should
                  regard me as a poisonous reptile, and shun me as you would a pestilence! It is fit
                  that you should do this, for I feel, while in your presence, that I am, indeed, a
                  thing to be despised and condemned, but yet I implore you, by the charity which
                  the Saviour of mankind exercised when he gave utterance to the hope-inspiring
                  words, 'Go, and sin no more,' hear me, but a moment!'</p>
               <p>'Go on,' said Helen, quietly.</p>
               <p>'I admit,' continued Barker, 'that I have been profligate, reckless and wicked,
                  but I never was the wretch which you are willing to believe me. I never throughout
                  my licentious career, forgot the respect which was due to virtue—I have made
                  companions of the profligate and vicious, but I have never brought disgrace to an
                  honest man's hearth, and I would (may God so prosper me as I speak truly!) have
                  rescued you from that vile den, had I but known the circumstances under which you
                  were brought there, even though death itself had been the consequence of my
                  interference.'</p>
               <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6405-00000088"/>
               <p>The spirit of truth gleamed in his eyes, and shone in every lineament of his face
                  as he spoke, and Helen believed him. With a sweet smile she answered—</p>
               <p>'I am happy to hear it, for there is a hope that that one spark of virtue, nearly
                  obscured though it has been by the mists of crime and folly, may now receive a new
                  effulgence and burn with a glorious light hereafter. Farewell!'</p>
               <p>'But one moment more!' cried Barker, as she again turned to go—'May I not think of
                  you hereafter, and indulge in a hope that however distant the time, I may again
                  behold and speak with you?'</p>
               <p>She shook her head.</p>
               <p>'Consider well,' he exclaimed imploringly, 'ere you condemn a soul newly awakened
                  to virtue and to hope, to blank despair forever! I feel that upon you depends
                  either my salvation or my irretrievable ruin. Bid me hope, and the panting deer
                  never strove harder to reach the limpid stream than I will strive to gain the
                  waters of eternal life, but cast me off totally, and like the drowning mariner in
                  the ocean, without help at hand, I will cease to hope and I am lost. O, be
                  merciful! be just! I do not ask you to love me—that is a heaven which I dare not
                  even hope ever to reach, but I ask you to be my friend—my sister! Say that we
                  shall meet again, and the recollection of that promise shall act with me as an
                  incentive to deeds of virtue—never will I for get it—like a charmed talisman I
                  will hug it to my heart, and it will render me proof against the shafts of
                  ridicule and abuse, and all the wiles which Satan spreads to catch the erring.
                  Say, shall we meet again? Answer but yes, and till that blessed time my life shall
                  be one long day of penance for past offences!'</p>
               <p>As he stretched his hands imploringly towards her, a look of painful earnestness
                  dwelt upon his features, and his whole soul seemed to hang upon her answer. He did
                  not wait for it long. For a moment only she hesitated, and then in a voice
                  tremulous with emotion, and plaintively sweet, she replied—</p>
               <p>'I feel that you are indeed penitent, and I will grant your request, providing
                  that nothing happens in the meantime which would justify me in withholding my
                  promise. But I will not say when our next meeting shall take place. I may come
                  upon you when you least expect it, and I may give you warning of my
                  approach—circumstances will regulate the manner of my coming. In a short time I
                  leave here for my home in the country, and it is uncertain when I shall return to
                  the city again, but in conclusion, rest assured of this, that whether we meet
                  again or not, depends entirely upon yourself. And now farewell.' She extended her
                  hand as she finished speaking, and rushing towards her, he gently took it and
                  covered it with burning kisses—then letting it fall he sank abashed into a chair,
                  and buried his face in his hands. When he again raised his head he was alone, but
                  he arose from his seat with a light heart and a buoyant spirit. His good angel had
                  indeed departed, but it seemed to him as though a portion of the holy light which
                  radiated from her heaven-lit eyes had found a nestling place in his sin laden
                  soul, and burned there with a steady fire.</p>
               <p>'Well,' said Minnie Jay, coming into the room just after Helen had departed, and
                  looking mischievously at Robert Barker, 'have you and Miss Wallace made up your
                  last night's differences, or have you sent her off in a passion again?' (The
                  little teaze had just left Helen talking to the old folks up stairs, in the very
                  best of humors.)</p>
               <p>'No, Miss Jay,' was his reply, 'thank fortune she did not leave me in anger—on the
                  contrary I trust we parted, if not quite, at least <emph>almost</emph>
                  friends.</p>
               <p>'Well, if that's the case,' said Minnie, with a laugh, 'I suppose you've
                  accomplished all you came for, and now you might as well clear out, and leave me
                  at liberty to do my work. Tell the truth now, didn't you expect to meet her
                  here?'</p>
               <p>'To be candid with you,' replied Bob, smiling, 'I did not<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000089"/> expect to meet her here, but I did wish to, and I
                  suppose that's about as bad.'</p>
               <p>'To be sure it is,' said Minnie, with affected displeasure, 'quite as bad—so off
                  with you, and don't let me see you here again, till—till—till—you're inclined to
                  come!'</p>
               <p>'Well, good morning then,' said Bob, 'if you're in such a hurry to get rid of me,'
                  and putting on his hat he sallied forth.</p>
               <p>It was shortly after this that he met the ill-fated Sam Slocumb, as before
                  mentioned, and on leaving him, he took his way to the halls of justice where he
                  lodged a complaint against a certain infamous house, after which he went home, and
                  shutting himself up in his library, he took up the first volume that came to hand,
                  and tried to argue himself into the belief that he was reading when he was doing
                  nothing of the sort, but keeping up a very strong thinking all the time about a
                  certain young lady instead.</p>
               <p>The next day mother Waffles, together with all the inmates of her house, including
                  Mr. George Cantwell, who happened to be there at the time, were arrested on a
                  charge of keeping an infamous house. They were not kept in durance long, however,
                  for money is all-powerful in such cases. Bail was easily obtained, and it was not
                  a great while afterwards that they were at the old business again, with renewed
                  energy. They were not a little surprised when they ascertained who it was that had
                  laid the complaint against them, and Cantwell, with a terrible oath swore that Bob
                  Barker should answer for it, if it ever lay in his power to bring him to
                  account.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <p>AFTER the escape of Estelle, Everard Emory left no means untried to gain a
                  knowledge of the route which the fugitives had taken. In vain did he fee different
                  members of the detective force to search the city, in vain did he advertise in the
                  daily papers—he could learn nothing of them. This gave him considerable concern.
                  Not that he cared at all for his wife, for he had grown tired of her, and the
                  assurance that she was dead would have rejoiced him. But a degree of affection had
                  sprung up in his cold, selfish heart for his child, and he would have given much
                  could he have obtained possession of it. It worried him to think that Estelle
                  should have the rearing of the boy, for he knew that she would teach him to hate
                  his father, and apart from his desire to gain the child's affection, it would have
                  been a gratification to him if he could have thwarted her.</p>
               <p>He staid in the city for about a month, and then in despair of ever finding them,
                  he took his way back to ——, in about as amiable a mood as a hungry tiger might be
                  supposed to entertain after having been cheated of his prey.</p>
               <p>It was dusk when he arrived at home, and after having doffed his coat, put on a
                  loose gown, encased his feet in slippers<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6405-00000090"
                  /> pers, swallowed about a double dose of brandy and water, and lighted a cigar,
                  he seated himself in an easy chair, placed his heels upon the back of another,
                  fetching them about on a level with his head, and as he gazed dreamily at the
                  lazily-ascending smoke which he puffed at intervals from his mouth, a look of
                  malice and serenity blended seemed to rest upon his hypocritical face.</p>
               <p>Suddenly he was startled by a rap at the door, and bringing his feet to the floor,
                  he growled out 'Come in!' in answer to which bidding, Mr. George Cantwell, blandly
                  smiling as usual, made his appearance.</p>
               <p>'All alone, eh, Emory?' he said, in his chuckling, tantalizing way, 'indulging in
                  solitude? Well, it's agreeable, sometimes—provocative of thought, ain't it? I like
                  it myself, occasionally—I'm fond of getting alone by myself, and thinking how much
                  good I've accomplished—how many charitable institutions I've founded, how many
                  missionaries I've sent out among the heathens at my own expense, etc. Pleasant—he!
                  he! he!—very pleasant—ho! ho! ho! Oh, my!'</p>
               <p>'What do you want?' asked Emory, abruptly, and in a stern tone.</p>
               <p>'O, nothing particular,' was the reply, 'only I was going to town to-morrow, and I
                  thought I'd call and let you know, thinking that perhaps you might have some
                  business for me to attend to.'</p>
               <p>'Clear out!' said Emory, 'and don't let me see your face again till I send for
                  you.'</p>
               <p>Cantwell started to go, but he had scarcely reached the door, when his employer
                  yelled out—</p>
               <p>'Stay! You're in a great hurry to obey me when there's no need of it. Sit down,
                  and keep your tongue still.'</p>
               <p>Cantwell as ordered threw himself into a chair, and his face plainly indicated the
                  exultation which was in his heart. He saw that Emory was greatly troubled in mind
                  and he was pleased in a corresponding degree. Indeed, so strongly did this feeling
                  have possession of him that he could not repress an audible titter of
                  satisfaction.</p>
               <p>'What are you laughing at, you beast?' growled the rich knave.</p>
               <p>'O, nothing,' replied Cantwell, 'I was just thinking of a good joke I heard
                  to-day, that's all!' and again that malicious giggle escaped him.</p>
               <p>'You lie, you dog!' yelled Emory, furiously, 'you know that I'm in trouble, and
                  you are exulting over it!'</p>
               <p>'No, no—honor bright!' exclaimed Cantwell, with affected sensitiveness, 'do you
                  suppose I'm so much wanting in respect to you as to indulge in merriment at your
                  expense'? O, no—I beg you wouldn't think it! But that was such a capital joke! The
                  more I think of it the funnier it seems! He! he! he!'</p>
               <p>'I say you lie!' roared Emory, 'you are laughing at me!' Then suddenly looking
                  Cantwell full in the eye, he continued, 'if the joke is such a capital one,
                  suppose you retail it so that I may enjoy a laugh as well as yourself?'</p>
               <p>'Well,' answered Cantwell, somewhat frightened at this sudden demand upon him, and
                  hesitating to make up a lie, 'you know old Bowring the broker, don't you? Well, he
                  met Briggs on 'Change the other day, and addressing him he said, 'Briggs,' said
                  he, 'how's Harlem?' 'Harlem?' answered Briggs, 'Harlem? why, Harlem's pretty well
                  I thank you!''</p>
               <p>Here Cantwell paused, but observing that Emory still glared angrily upon him, he
                  continued—</p>
               <p>'That ain't where the laugh comes in, though. Then Bow-ring, he said, 'Briggs,'
                  said he, 'do you know why you're like—no, that ain't it—why I'm like—no, that
                  ain't it, neither—do you know—''</p>
               <p>'Silence!' roared Emory, 'you poll-parrot!—you drivelling fool! you unmitigated
                  jackanapes! Do you suppose that I'm so dull as not to see through your rank
                  hypocrisy? Look you! be a little more careful how you outrage my feelings in<pb
                     n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6405-00000091"/> future, do you hear, or some day in my
                  anger, a bullet hole will let out what little brains you possess. Now tell me, can
                  you imagine any way by which I would be likely to trace my wife? If it were to
                  gratify yourself I have no doubt you could do it, but since it's to gratify me, I
                  suppose the task will be a hard one. However, to lighten it, I will give you a
                  thousand dollars if you will find out where she has gone.'</p>
               <p>A look of savage joy danced in the eyes of Cantwell, at this liberal offer. He had
                  waited some time for Emory to make it, and it had come at last. He
                     <emph>did</emph> know what port she had sailed for, but he was not going to
                  tell Emory—no, not for a thousand dollars ten times told, much as he loved money.
                  He did not know, however, that Slocumb's career had been so suddenly cut short—he
                  was under the impression that Estelle and Kate O'Donnell were by that time in New
                  Orleans, and Slocumb with them. He knew that Estelle had not taken her babe with
                  her, too—he had gained the knowledge that she intended to leave it behind, and who
                  she intended to leave it with, while listening at the door when Estelle and the
                  servant were forming their plans. He knew much that Emory would have rejoiced to
                  know, but he determined to keep the knowledge to himself, and send Emory on a
                  wild-goose chase, if possible. So assuming a serious air, he replied in answer to
                  his employer's question—</p>
               <p>'Well, I don't <emph>know</emph> anything about the matter, but, now I think of
                  it, a little circumstance happened about two weeks ago which, perhaps, will throw
                  some light on the matter. At that time I met a mutual friend of ours—Sam
                  Slocumb—who told me that he had induced your wife to run away and accompany him to
                  one of the country towns in the State of Connecticut, where he had been purchasing
                  a piece of property. He said he didn't have to coax her much—that she seemed
                  perfectly willing to go, and he had no doubt that they would get along very well
                  together. He said he had determined to assume the name of Matthews, while she
                  would take the name of your old flame, Jeannette, and pass as his wife. He also
                  said that she was terribly bitter against you, and intended to teach her boy to
                  hate the name of Emory. Now, I don't know that this is entitled to a moment's
                  consideration, but Sam has not been seen since, and that certainly looks
                  suspicious.'</p>
               <p>The working of Emory's countenance was fearful to look upon at different parts of
                  Cantwell's statement, and, unable longer to contain himself, he sprang from his
                  chair, and, seizing his tantalizing employee by the throat, he shouted—</p>
               <p>'Devil! why did you not tell me of this before?'</p>
               <p>'Keep cool, my dear sir!—don't get in a passion!' expostulated Cantwell, as he
                  struggled to free himself, and, having at length succeeded in breaking Emory's
                  hold, he induced that individual to reseat himself, when he continued: 'I didn't
                  speak of it before, for the simple reason that I didn't believe a word of it. You
                  know what a fellow Sam is to talk. He is always boasting of his conquests among
                  women, and half the time there's no truth in what he says, though, to do him
                  justice, he is very often successful. Nothing is easier, though, than for you to
                  satisfy yourself of the truth of his story. A day's travel will take you to the
                  spot, and, if you don't find it so, you will only have to come back again. You
                  asked me for the information—I have given it, and I don't see why you should get
                  in a passion about it.'</p>
               <p>'I will go,' exclaimed Emory, decidedly, 'but first I will institute inquiries as
                  to whether Slocumb has lately purchased any property in Connecticut, and also
                  whether he has been absent from the city for the length of time which you say he
                  has. If upon enquiry the story proves true, well and good. But if you have been
                  inventing a story to torture me, beware!'</p>
               <p>'All right,' answered Cantwell, 'I hope you will find her, but if you do not it
                  will not be my fault.'</p>
               <p>A silence of a few moments ensued, when at length Emory asked,</p>
               <p>'Do you think I will be troubled with her again?'</p>
               <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6405-00000092"/>
               <p>'Guess not,' returned Cantwell. 'She promised me, at the last interview I had with
                  her, that she would never disturb you again, and I think you may rest easy on that
                  head, for to judge from the way she looked I shouldn't wonder if she was past
                  disturbing any one by this time.'</p>
               <p>Another pause ensued, and then Emory, with a look of malice, inquired</p>
               <p>'Do you think these worthy relatives of mine, the old man and his remaining
                  daughter, knew anything of Estelle's intention before she ran away?'</p>
               <p>'Can't say,' answered Cantwell, 'such a thing is possible—they may have been a
                  party to the affair for what I know. It is not at all likely that they would
                  acknowledge it however if they were.'</p>
               <p>'I am not foolish enough to suppose that they would,' answered Emory, 'so I shall
                  not waste my breath by asking the question, but shall treat them as though I knew
                  them to be my enemies. Send the old man here.'</p>
               <p>Cantwell left the room to obey the order, and as he passed through the entry
                  leading to old Mr. Grant's apartment, he muttered to himself, 'I do manage to
                  teaze him some—I can see him writhe beneath the torture, and Oh, how it gratifies
                  me; but if he <emph>should</emph> go to Connecticut—ah, there, indeed, I have a
                  surpise for him, which will well repay me for the trouble I have taken.'</p>
               <p>He reached the old merchant's apartment, and knocked at the door. It was opened by
                  Mr. Grant himself. The old man was terribly wasted, and no one would have
                  recognized in him the hale, hearty man of a few years previous. His frame had
                  shrunk to a mere anatomy of his former self, and he was as nervous as a
                  drunkard.</p>
               <p>'Ah, how are you, dad?' exclaimed Cantwell, with impudent familiarity, 'hope
                  you're well—Emory wants to see you, right away.'</p>
               <p>There was a time when such a salutation from such a person son as Cantwell would
                  have subjected the utterer to a fall upon the floor from the strong arm of the old
                  man, but he had grown familiar with all sorts of indignities now, and did not mind
                  it. After the flight of Estelle, Emory had grown actually brutal in his conduct
                  both to him and his daughter, and he dreaded even to look upon him. So instead of
                  taking Cantwell to task for his impudence, he merely enquired in a voice betraying
                  great nervous agitation, 'Do you know what my son-in-law wants with me, Mr.
                  Cantwell?'</p>
               <p>'No, dad,' was the reply, 'I never stop to inquire into his motives, and I'd
                  advise you not to do so. He's always doing a kind turn for somebody, though, and I
                  suppose that's what he's after now—probably he is about to redeem the promise
                  which he has been making you all along, that he would set you up in business.'</p>
               <p>'Do you think so?' enquired the old man, eagerly—'did he look pleased? Maybe he
                  has heard tidings of Estelle! I'll go to him right away! He isn't such a bad man
                  after all—no, no, there's worse men than Emory!' and the poor, spirit-crushed old
                  man, who had been brought almost to the verge of idiocy by harsh treatment, arose
                  and took his way towards his son-in-law's apartment, while Cantwell, with a
                  heartless grin upon his repulsive countenance, departed from the house.</p>
               <p>When old Mr. Grant entered the room where Emory sat, the latter was resting his
                  head upon the table, as though in a profound study—when he heard the door open,
                  however, he raised his eyes suddenly towards the old man, and growled out—</p>
               <p>'Now, then, old man, do you know why I've sent for you?'</p>
               <p>'No, my son, I do not,' was the tremulous answer of the old gentleman, whose
                  heart, which Cantwell had lightened considerably, again sank like lead within him
                  at the stern tone of the tyrant.</p>
               <p>'Then I'll tell you,' said Emory; 'you've been living upon<pb n="184-185"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000093"/> me long enough—and now I want you to go—both you
                  and your precious daughter.'</p>
               <p>The old gentleman did not seem to comprehend the cruel fiend's meaning, but stood
                  gazing upon him with a bewildered air, as though willing for an explanation, and
                  yet dreading to ask for it.</p>
               <p>'I want you to go! To clear out!' repeated Emory; 'don't you understand, you
                  nervous old fool?'</p>
               <p>'Yes, certainly, my son,' replied the old man, with a smile of incredulity that
                  would have touched a heart of stone—'I understand—you want me to go somewhere for
                  you, and I'll do it—of course I will—where is it? where shall I go?'</p>
               <p>'To the poor house!' shouted Emory, springing to his feet, and regarding the old
                  man with a look which caused him to quake with fear—'to the poor house, or
                  anywhere else—to the devil if you like, but you must leave here! Now do you
                  understand?'</p>
               <p>He was answered only by a meaningless stare. The last feeble ray of reason had
                  fled from the poor old man's brain forever! He was a gaping, staring, leering
                  idiot!</p>
               <p>Three days afterwards Florence Hollowell was turned out of the house, and her
                  father was sent to the Lunatic Asylum, having accomplished which noble acts,
                  Everard Emory started for New York, where he satisfied himself by enquiry, that
                  Sam Slocumb had disappeared, and that he had also recently purchased a piece of
                  property in Connecticut, and then he started for the town in that State designated
                  by Cantwell.</p>
               <p>He reached there without accident, and having put up at a hotel, he proceeded to
                  make enquiries concerning the fugitives. He learned from the landlord that a
                  gentleman calling himself Matthews, accompanied by a female, had arrived there
                  about two weeks previously—that the gentleman had almost immediately left again,
                  but that the lady was still there, and that he believed she was quite unwell.
                  Emory was now certain that he had got on the right trail, and the house which he
                  was anxious to find having been pointed out to him, he proceeded to it at once,
                  and knocked for admission. The door was opened by an elderly man upon whose
                  countenance rested a shade of deep melancholy, and without ceremony, Emory
                  enquired—</p>
               <p>'Is there a Mrs. Matthews stopping at this house?'</p>
               <p>'There is a <emph>Miss</emph> Matthews stopping here,' was the reply, 'at least
                  she was here when I left her bedside this moment, but already her soul may have
                  taken its flight, for she has been dying this two hours.'</p>
               <p>'And where is her infant?' asked Emory, abruptly.</p>
               <p>'Her infant!' echoed the man, and for a moment a look of mingled shame and sorrow
                  overspread his face, but at length he continued, 'well, well, I see that you know
                  all, and concealment is useless—her infant is dead!'</p>
               <p>'Then let me see her before she dies!' exclaimed Emory, who longed for the savage
                  gratification of hissing into the ear of his dying wife his parting curse.</p>
               <p>'This way then,' returned the man, and conducting Emory up stairs he led him into
                  the sick room.</p>
               <p>The dying woman was propped up in her bed with pillows, and just in front of her,
                  hiding her from the view of Emory as he entered, stood her nurse performing some
                  kindly office. A curse was upon the lips of the fiendish hypocrite, and he rushed
                  forward to hurl it upon the departing soul of the invalid, when what was his
                  consternation to behold not the countenance of his wife, but that of his victim
                  Jeannette Matthews.</p>
               <p>A strange light gleamed in the eyes of the dying girl as she steadily regarded
                  him, and presently her lips parted, and a feeble, yet wild and unearthly cry broke
                  from them. 'It <emph>is</emph> him!' she exclaimed, as she reached forth her hand
                  and clutched her fingers as though in the endeavor to grasp him!—'it is
                     <emph>him!</emph> I knew I should see him again! Uncle! aunt! Behold my
                  seducer!'</p>
               <p>Her eyes closed and those who stood around her thought<pb n="186-187"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000094"/> that her spirit had departed. This was a relief to
                  Emory, who at the first sound of her voice had sunk coweringly into a chair, but
                  when he heard them say that she was dead, he assumed his usual haughty and bold
                  demeanor.</p>
               <p>'Did that poor girl speak truly?' sternly demanded the old gentleman who admitted
                  him.</p>
               <p>'No,' replied Emory, 'she gave utterance to the words of a disordered mind. I
                  never saw her before. I came here to seek my wife, but I have been misled.' He
                  looked up as he finished speaking and was horrified to observe those large,
                  glassy, staring orbs again fixed upon him.</p>
               <p>'Emory! Liar! Devil!' shrieked the fast dying woman, pausing between each word for
                  breath, 'you avoided me long, but fate has brought you here at last against your
                  will to receive my dying curse! May all the ills that can beset a mortal light
                  upon and crush you! May your future days be blasted and blighted as mine have
                  been! May your ill-gotten wealth vanish, and may gaunt famine haunt you like a
                  spectre! May disease waste your frame, and may carding care shatter your
                  intellect! May you pray for death, yet live till old age overtakes you, a bye-word
                  and a reproach in the mouths of all, a foul excrescence upon the face of the earth
                  for the finger of scorn to point at—may misery unspeakable accompany you to your
                  pillow when you lay down to rest at night, and may you arise in the morning only
                  to commence a day of hew sorrow, and when you come to die, as I am dying now, may
                  the laugh of mockery and the jest of scorn fill your ears, and may the arch fiend
                  seize——' suddenly her tongue refused its office, and she stopped short, as though
                  her dreadful curse had been arrested by a messenger from Heaven. The death rattle
                  sounded in her throat, her features became rigid, her jaw dropped, and she fell
                  back a corpse. At the same moment, Emory, with an imprecation, rushed from the
                  apartment, and boiling over with rage against Cantwell, turned his face
                  homeward.</p>

               <p>NOT long after the death of the unfortunate Jeannette Matthews, one of those
                  extraordinary females who pretend to have a perfect knowledge of past, present,

                  consideration, to all such as seek for hidden knowledge, necessary instructions
                  concerning courtship, marriage, lost articles, etc., hung out her shingle in an
                  obscure street in the upper section of New York. Madame Duroc was the name of this
                  Pythoness, and as she advertised largely and charged a good round price for her
                  'slices of mystery,' weak-minded people of course thought that she must be
                  something very wonderful, and it was not a great while before she was fairly run
                  down with customers. Among the first who paid her a visit was Everard Emory, and
                  why he called upon her, and what he thought of her pretensions may be best
                  gathered from the conversation which took place at the interview between them.</p>
               <p>It was early in the afternoon when he called, and he was for some time kept
                  waiting in an ante-room before he could obtain an audience. At length, however, a
                  little nut-headed, thick-lipped, flat-nosed African page most fantastically
                  arrayed, made his appearance, and intimating that the mysterious lady<pb
                     n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6405-00000095"/> was ready to see him, led the way to
                  her apartment, having reached which, he knocked in the true style of mysticism
                  three times upon the door, in answer to which a voice sepulchral enough to suit
                  the most ardent lover of the marvellous exclaimed— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Enter, man of mortal mould—</l>
                        <l>I the key to knowledge hold—</l>
                        <l>Seek ye stolen jewels rare,</l>
                        <l>Long-lost friend, or wife, or heir,</l>
                        <l>Enter! you need not despair—</l>
                        <l rend="ti-3">Enter! Enter!"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> and as the last word was uttered, the negro opened the door, and ushered
                  Emory into the room.</p>
               <p>It was a singular looking apartment, and somewhat circumscribed in its dimensions.
                  In the middle of it stood a table which reached the extreme length from wall to
                  wall, and which was covered by a cloth bearing a red ground, upon which was worked
                  with white silk, all sorts of singular hieroglyphics and cabalistic figures. In
                  the centre of the table stood a globe upon a large, mouldy-looking open volume
                  filled with lines and grotesque figures, while near it upon either side were
                  scattered heaps of antiquated books of smaller size, together with a pack of cards
                  and a number of singularly-constructed instruments, the use of which it would have
                  puzzled the most inventive genius that ever lived to discover. The mantle-piece
                  was covered with skulls, cross bones, and dried herbs, and phials containing
                  different colored liquids were hung up in many places around the walls, which were
                  ornamented besides by scrolls of parchment and framed hieroglyphics. The light of
                  day was nearly excluded from the room by the close-drawn curtains, and its place
                  was supplied only by a dimly-burning lamp upon the table, which threw its feeble,
                  sickly rays around, rendering the place more gloomy even than it would have been
                  without it.</p>
               <p>The presiding priestess of this temple was seated on a sort of throne directly
                  behind the table. She was dressed as fantastically, but more richly, than her
                  attendant page. She wore a blue silk boddice, studded with crimson and
                  silver-colored stars, a flaming red silk skirt and trail, and a flowing
                  gossamer-like scarf edged with gold rested upon her left shoulder, crossed her
                  breast, and fastened with a bow at her right side. Her head was crowned by a
                  wreath formed of stuffed reptiles, fantastically interwoven, while her hair hung
                  loosely about her shoulders. Her features were good enough, but her skin seemed
                  shrivelled and yellow, and altogether she possessed anything but a prepossessing
                  appearance.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
               <p>THE Pythoness sat quietly looking at Emory, after the page had disappeared, for
                  some moments, and when she thought he was sufficiently impressed by the scene
                  around him, she said, in a ghost-like voice—</p>
               <p>'Thou art incredulous, and thy heart is filled with unbelief, but thou shalt
                  believe before thou goest forth again. Come hither!'</p>
               <p>'O, have done with your nonsensical rigmarole,' exclaimed Emory, impatiently, 'I
                  did not come here to make a fool of myself by listening to your meaningless
                  mummery, but to gain information which I think you may, from your position, be
                  likely to possess.'</p>
               <p>'I <emph>do</emph> possess the knowledge which thou seekest,' answered the
                  fortune-teller, with a frown, 'but whether I will reveal it or not depends upon
                  circumstances. Thy bearing is too bold and<pb n="190-191"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000096"/> imperious for a man steeped to the lips in crime.
                  Thou art a villain, and shouldst bend low in meek submission, rather than elevate
                  thy form and contract thy brow, as thou dost.'</p>
               <p>'Infamous hag!' exclaimed Emory, angrily, 'how dare you insult a gentleman?
                  Indulge in another expression such as that which you have just uttered, and I will
                  expose your charlatanry, and have you dragged through the streets before a justice
                  of the peace, and sent to the penitentiary as a vagrant.'</p>
               <p>'Not so fast, Sir Everard Emory,' said the Pythoness, in a tone of sarcasm, 'thou
                  wouldst no sooner put thy threat in execution than thou wouldst cut off thy right
                  arm. A man of thy standing in society would not like to have it known in a court
                  of justice that he had been guilty of causing the death of a too-confiding girl by
                  perfidy and ill-usage, and that he had been a party to the inveigling of another
                  into a den of vice. Ha, ha!' she continued, as Emory writhed under the fixed gaze
                  with which she regarded him, 'thou seest that I know thee.'</p>
               <p>'Where is the proof of the charges which you allege against me?' said the guilty
                  wretch, slightly altering his tone of defiance.</p>
               <p>'When it is necessary (if that time should ever arrive) to produce them,' answered
                  the mysterious lady, 'they shall be forthcoming—be thou well assured of this—I
                  have not obtained my information without fortifying myself with testimony. I have
                  no desire to reveal what I know, however, unless forced to do so. My trade is to
                  make money, not to act as a conservor of the laws. Thou seekest intelligence of
                  thy wife and child—what art thou willing to pay for a knowledge of their
                  whereabouts?'</p>
               <p>Emory was perfectly thunderstruck at the familiarity with his affairs evinced by
                  the strange being before him. He was confident that he had never seen her before;
                  and how she gained her information, unless by the aid of her occult science, he
                  could not possibly imagine. He was not willing to admit this hypothesis, but he
                  was forced in spite of himself to do so. He was not a man to be easily deceived,
                  and he had always regarded the class of individuals to which Madame Duroc
                  belonged, as the grossest imposters. Still he was aware that certain strange
                  forces, unknown to but few, existed in nature, and he persuaded himself that the
                  woman in question had command of them, because he could account for her knowledge
                  in no other way. So, after a few moments' reflection, he replied, with more
                  submission than he had before used—</p>
               <p>'I would give much to obtain possession of my child—for my wife I care but little.
                  I should rather hear of her death than to capture her.'</p>
               <p>'Give me a draft for a thousand dollars, and thou shalt have thy child,' said the
                  Pythoness, 'but not at once—it will take me some time to obtain a knowledge of its
                  exact locality, and some further time to secure it after. I have gained the
                  knowledge which I seek.'</p>
               <p>'A thousand dollars is a large sum,' answered Emory, hesitatingly.</p>
               <p>'If it is too large an amount,' answered the woman, contemptuously, 'our interview
                  may as well end at once. I imagined I was dealing liberally with thee.'</p>
               <p>'But what security have I,' said Emory, in some perturbation, 'that you will act
                  in good faith?'</p>
               <p>'What security,' replied the woman of mystery, her eyes flashing angrily—'what
                  better security dost thou want than the knowledge of the fact that I can crush
                  thee at a moment's notice, if I so determine? Dost thou think that, after having
                  succeeded in drawing thee here, I will allow thee to depart without leaving a
                  portion of thy ill-gotten gains, or suffering the consequences? Never believe
                  it!'</p>
               <p>'Enough—enough,' said Emory, now completely subdued, 'I will agree to your terms;'
                  then hastily scratching a draft with a pen which the woman dipped in ink and
                  handed to him, he continued, 'here is the paper you require; and now when<pb
                     n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6405-00000097"/> shall I have the satisfaction of seeing
                  my infant son safe under my care?'</p>
               <p>'When it pleases the fates to assist me,' was the abrupt reply; 'and now go—but
                  before thou goest, I will give thee an indisputable proof of my knowledge of the
                  future as well as if the past and present. Steps have already been taken by
                  certain members of thy church to have thee expelled. The principal witness against
                  thee is a young man named Barker, recently become a convert, and I would warn thee
                  not to call upon him to substantiate his charges, for he will assuredly do so, to
                  the perfect satisfaction of thy brethren. Thine only course is to put on a show of
                  virtuous indignation, and to go out from among them without standing trial, under
                  the pretence that thy feelings are outraged because they have dared to suspect
                  thee.' Here she rung a bell, and the black page before alluded to, made his
                  appearance. 'Paul,' she continued, 'show the stranger out,' and without being
                  allowed to ask any further questions, Emory was led out as mysteriously as he had
                  been admitted.</p>
               <p>As soon as the door had fairly closed upon him, another door which fitted into the
                  partition just behind the chair occupied by the woman of magic, opened suddenly,
                  and George Cantwell, with a loud laugh, rushed into the room.</p>
               <p>'Good—good,' he cried, addressing the Pythoness, who, taking off a closely-fitting
                  mask, displayed to view the features of Florence Hollowell, 'why, Florence, you
                  play your part admirably—far beyond my most sanguine expectations. A thousand
                  dollars at the very first effort. Well, he promised me as much as that for sending
                  him to Connecticut, but he didn't dream of paying me in this way. Oh, you are a
                  very queen of mysterious ladies!' and in his ecstacy he caught her in his arms and
                  embraced her warmly.</p>
               <p>'Moderate your feelings a little,' exclaimed Florence, breaking from him, 'and
                  don't be too familiar, or you will force me to give up an occupation which I would
                  gladly continue somewhat longer.'</p>
               <p>'Not for the world!' answered Cantwell—'after such a glorious beginning it would
                  grieve me more than I can tell to relinquish the game. We are equally interested
                  in this affair, both as regards satisfaction and emolument, and although I should
                  rejoice to claim a more intimate relationship with you, still sooner than any
                  cause of difference should exist between us, I will become a <emph>silent</emph>
                  partner, and never even speak to you.'</p>
               <p>'It is well,' answered Florence, 'see that you do not hereafter forget our
                  compact—and now, what is further to be done?'</p>
               <p>'Nothing, just yet,' answered Cantwell—'like the wily spider in his web, we have
                  the fly enmeshed, and we may now take our time to entangle him. We can put him off
                  from time to time with false promises—lure him on step by step with ingenious
                  devices—drain him dry of his wealth, then force him into the commission of some
                  crime—murder if possible—and then hang him. Glorious! glorious!' and in his
                  transport he danced around the room like a crazy man.</p>
               <p>'I fear that you are altogether too sanguine,' said Florence, seriously—'you seem
                  to forget that there is a possibility of failure—Everard Emory is a shrewd man,
                  and not easily duped so egregiously. He may perhaps fall into an error, but it
                  does not follow that he should continue therein, and he may wake up when we least
                  expect it.'</p>
               <p>'I have counted all the chances,' was the reply of Cantwell, 'and I tell you we
                  must succeed. He never can discover my agency in the matter, and as for you, your
                  own father wouldn't know you in your complete disguise and excellently well
                  altered voice.'</p>
               <p>'By the way,' asked Florence, 'how did you succeed in drawing him here?'</p>
               <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6405-00000098"/>
               <p>'By the simplest contrivance in the world,' answered Cantwell. 'I knew that he
                  would go to any place where the slightest possibility existed of his hearing from
                  the fugitives, and although I was aware that he had no faith in fortune tellers, I
                  argued—and as the result proved correctly—that he would be very apt to visit one,
                  if his attention was called to that portion of your circular wherein you pledge
                  yourself to find lost relatives; so I gave a boy a lot of them to distribute among
                  the passengers on board of the boat which brought him to New York, and had the
                  satisfaction of seeing him take one and read it, in the absence of something
                  better to do—if this had failed, I should have tried something else, but it was
                  entirely successful, and so further trouble on that score was saved me.'</p>
               <p>'That was a good move of yours in exposing him to Barker,' said Fanny
                  approvingly.</p>
               <p>'I flatter myself it was,' replied Cantwell, "and I had a double purpose to serve.
                  I have a little account to settle with that same Bob Barker for causing my arrest,
                  and by leading him to procure Emory's expulsion from the church—binding him, at
                  the same time, by the most solemn obligations, not to reveal his informant—I made
                  for him a most inveterate foe in Emory, who will move heaven and earth to be
                  revenged upon him. Thus you see they are both instruments in my hands—they injure
                  each other, and I am revenged upon both, while at the same time I am not suspected
                  of having any hand in the affair.'</p>
               <p>'You are an excellent plotter, Cantwell,' said Florence, in a tone of admiration,
                  'and I can't see what has ever kept you in your present position. I should think
                  that talent such as you possess would command a higher place for its possessor in
                  the social scale than that which you occupy, and as for money, what keeps you from
                  being immensely rich?'</p>
               <p>'Well, as far as position in life is concerned,' said Cantwell, with a laugh, 'I
                  suppose my extreme modesty has kept me back, but as to wealth, I can't plead
                  poverty—on the contrary, I must admit that I have every reason to feel satisfied
                  with fortune for the manner in which she has served me. I don't think I can ever
                  become a beggar.' He paused a moment—and then, as a malicious chuckle escaped him,
                  he continued, 'Yes, as you say, I am able to hold my end up when it comes to deep
                  calculation, but I did come near slipping up in that last affair with Emory. I had
                  all I could do to convince him that I was sincere in sending him to find his wife
                  in Connecticut, but I succeeded at last.'</p>
               <p>'And what argument could you possibly have used to convince him?' enquired
                  Florence.</p>
               <p>'Why, I persuaded him,' answered Cantwell, 'that it was a plan of Slocumb's, who
                  in a vindictive moment determined to "sell" me, and through me, him—before I could
                  make him believe it, however, I had to take my oath that I had met Slocumb the day
                  after he (Emory) had started for Connecticut, and that he had acknowledged to me
                  that he had accidentally become acquainted with the history of Jeannette Matthews,
                  who was in some way related to him, and had practised the deception to punish
                  Emory.'</p>
               <p>At this point in the conversation the street door bell was violently agitated, and
                  shortly afterwards the negro page, Paul, grinning from ear to ear, again made his
                  appearance.</p>
               <p>'Who is it this time, Paul,' questioned Florence, 'a gentleman or a lady?'</p>
               <p>'A gemman,' answered the negro, 'an' I golly! wot a fine lookin' gemman he am too!
                  Such mustachers, an' whiskers, an' jewelyery, an' eberyting. De lord-a-massy, dat

               <p>'Please attend to your own business, you little imp of Satan,' said Florence,
                  angrily, 'and keep your tongue between your teeth, do you hear?'</p>
               <p>'O yes, I'se got nuffin to say no more—I'se done,' answered the negro, 'shill I

               <p>'Yes, fetch him up at once,' replied Florence, 'and see that you do it properly,
                  or look out for those long ears of yours.'</p>
               <p>'Needn't be 'feard,' answered the negro, 'Paul got de items, dis nigger know what
                  he 'bout!—Phew!' and winking significantly, he again dislayed his ivory and
                  disappeared.</p>
               <p>'Now, then,' said Cantwell, 'I must make myself scarce. I hope this customer may
                  prove as desirable a one, as he who has just departed, but that would be almost
                  toomuch luck for one day.'</p>
               <p>He entered the secret room from which he had but a short time before emerged, and
                  shortly afterwards, with all the ceremony which had been before observed, another
                  individual was introduced into the presence of the <emph>Mysterious Lady,</emph>
                  who was of course seated on her magic throne, and fully prepared to receive
                  him.</p>
               <p>'Most terrible and august being,' began the new comer, in a tone of mock
                  seriousness, 'with a deep sense of the awful power which you possess, and with all
                  due humility and a disposition to 'shell out' liberally, I prostrate myself before
                  you, and beg that you will afford me some information concerning an individual who
                  but a short time since left these premises.'</p>
               <p>At the first sound of his voice, a tremor seized Florence, who gazed eagerly into
                  the face of the stranger, and even after he had ceased to speak, she continued to
                  study his features carefully without deigning to reply.</p>
               <p>'Cause me not to sink beneath the insupportable gaze of thy majesty, O, lady of
                  mystery!' again began the stranger, almost laughing outright in spite of his
                  endeavors to preserve a grave demeanor, 'but speak to thy servant—O, speak! As the
                  perplexed Hamlet says, 'Let me not <emph>bust</emph> in ignorance!''</p>
               <p>Florence struggled desperately to gain the mastery over herself, but she dared not
                  trust her tongue to utter a word, and as the stranger playfully approached her,
                  and endeavored to take her hand, a loud shriek burst from her, and she fell
                  senseless to the floor in a swoon.</p>
               <p>'Hello!' exclaimed the stranger, springing towards the window and throwing open
                  the shutter, in order to admit more light, 'Egad! this is more than I bargained
                  for! what the devil, I wonder, ails her mysterious ladyship!' Then approaching
                  Florence, he raised her from the floor, and discovering the mask, detached it from
                  her face just as Cantwell entered at one door and the negro Paul at the other. 'By
                  all the gods on high Olympus!' he exclaimed, 'may I never taste the sweets of
                  matrimonial bliss again if it isn't my wife!' Then recognizing Cantwell, whom he
                  had seen upon two or three occasions at Emory's house, he exclaimed, 'Why, Cant.,
                  old fel., how are you, and where did you come from so suddenly?'</p>
               <p>'The best thing you can do, answered Cantwell, stiffly, and endeavoring to appear
                  at his ease, 'is to leave here as speedily as possible, if you do not wish to be
                  furnished with lodgings at the expense of the State.'</p>
               <p>'Now,' said Hollowell, in a tone of mock sincerity, 'is that your candidly given
                  and disinterested opinion? But I won't question it—I have no doubt that it is, and
                  you can't tell how much I am obliged to you for it, but really I couldn't think of
                  leaving without having a few words with my dear wife, whom I have not seen before
                  for a long, long time. Here, Snowball,' he continued, addressing Paul, 'rush off
                  and get a pitcher of water.'</p>
               <p>'Here am water, massa,' replied the negro, going to a closet and producing a
                  pitcher.</p>
               <p>'Here—let's have it!' exclaimed Hollowell—'There!' he continued, as he dashed the
                  entire quantity over the face and neck of Florence—'that'll fetch her around.'</p>
               <p>He calculated rightly. Florence almost immediately slowly opened her eyes, but as
                  they fell upon the countenance of Hollowell, she shudderingly closed them
                  again.</p>
               <p>'Now don't "go off" again,' urged the free-and-easy knave,<pb n="198-199"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000100"/> 'don't, dear—please don't—it's so much trouble, you
                  know, to keep fetching water. I don't know the person I'd take more trouble for
                  than I would for you, but then you know it's so dem'd disagreeable! There you go
                  again!' he continued, 'here, Snowball, some more water—quick! d'ye hear?'</p>
               <p>'Yes, massa,' answered Paul, and he was about departing, when Florence, who had by
                  this time entirely recovered, and had only closed her eyes to shut out the
                  disagreeable face of her husband, stopped the boy with an impatient wave of her
                  hand, and looking straight at Hollowell, exclaimed, in a tone of the deepest
                  hate—</p>
               <p>'I had fervently hoped that you were either dead or im-mured for life within the
                  walls of some gloomy prison, but it would seem that I am never to be entirely rid
                  of you. What, in the name of all that is evil, induced you to come this way?'</p>
               <p>'Partly, the close pursuit of a gentleman connected with the law, who is extremely
                  anxious to make my acquaintance—partly from a desire to vary my line of travel,
                  but chiefly, the hope of seeing my darling wife,' replied Hollowell, attempting to
                  embrace Florence, who had risen in her feet, and stood scowlingly regarding
                  him.</p>
               <p>'Fiend! Beggar!' she exclaimed in a tone of bitter disgust, 'out of my sight!
                  begone! I should think the base wrongs you have already heaped upon me, would
                  secure me immunity from further persecution at your hands.'</p>
               <p>'Well, I like <emph>that!</emph>' exclaimed Hollowell, 'but it strikes me that in
                  this case I am the injured party! A pretty state of affairs, truly! Do you call
                  this living up to your matrimonial obligations? At the altar did you not solemnly
                  swear to love, honor, and obey me? To take me for better or for worse, and to
                  stick to me through good and through evil report? Did you not violate your solemn
                  vows almost as soon as they were uttered? and now, when I again find you, after a
                  long, and, to me, an excruciatingly painful absence, instead of rushing into my
                  arms as an affectionate wife should do, you talk of wrong and persecution! I am
                  astonished at you! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Florence! Your unkindness
                  will break my heart!' and the facetious adventurer, with a ludicrous air of
                  assumed grief, applied his handkerchief to his eyes.</p>
               <p>Florence could not answer; for she was choking with rage, and Cantwell stepped in
                  to her assistance—</p>
               <p>'Do you intend,' said he, addressing Hollowell, 'to leave this place at once,
                  while you have an opportunity of doing so with safety, or will you put us to the
                  trouble of furnishing you with an unpleasant abode, gratis?'</p>
               <p>'<emph>Us!</emph>' exclaimed Hollowell, laying a strong emphasis upon the
                  word—'come, that sounds business-like—We, Us &amp; Co.,—I see how it is, now—you
                  and Flor. have formed a co-partnership in the fortune-telling and matrimonial
                  line, and my presence here is disagreeable—you think I will interfere with the
                  latter branch of your business—but I don't know—perhaps we may be able to come to
                  terms—the fortune-telling must be lucrative, when you can boast such patrons as
                  Everard Emory, and if you will give me one-third of the gross profits, I won't
                  interfere with your domestic arrangements. Nothing could be fairer than that.
                  Come, what do you say?'</p>
               <p>'You poor, mean, contemptible wretch!' exclaimed Florence, again finding her
                  tongue, 'is it possible that such a pitiful apology for a man can be found as he
                  who is willing, for the sake of money, to submit to a wife's dishonor!'</p>
               <p>'O, well,' exclaimed Hollowell, with an air of perfect <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >nonchalance,</foreign> 'you needn't get so angry about it. If you wish me to
                  assert my conjugal rights, of course I will do so. Anything to please you At
                  present I am the most accommodating man alive; for the fact is, my area of liberty
                  is somewhat restricted. I scarcely dare to walk abroad for fear that I may feel a
                  familiar tap upon the shoulder, and my resources, I may truly say, are 'nowhere!'
                  I stand in need of both money and a place of refuge, and I don't know to whom a
                  man could so<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6405-00000101"/> naturally look for
                  assistance under the circumstances, as to his wife. Therefore, the sooner you
                  devise some means for my safety, the better—because if I cannot make terms with
                  you, I must go elsewhere.'</p>
               <p>'Quite reasonable, I declare!' answered Florence, with chagrin—'well, sir, I will
                  tell you what terms you can make with me. Instantly leave this place—I care not
                  where you go, or what you do—but begone at once or I will inform Mr. Everard Emory
                  of your presence in New York. He is very anxious to see you, and will, no doubt
                  afford you assistance immediately.'</p>
               <p>'Since I entered this place,' answered Hollowell in a deliberate tone, 'I have
                  come to the same conclusion thyself. The fact is, I saw Emory emerge from here,
                  and came near meeting him face to face. I was afraid of him then, and dodged him,
                  but curiosity prompted me to enter here for the purpose of ascertaining his
                  business. Now, I have not ascertained what he came after, but I have found out
                  that you received him in disguise, and that he would give considerable to know who
                  his mysterious friend is. He is not of a very forgiving turn, I know, but he is
                  always willing to make a good bargain, and within the last few moments I have
                  determined, if we cannot agree, to try my luck with him. What do you think of my
                  plan? Of course, you won't refuse to give me your advice?'</p>
               <p>Florence at once saw that she was caught in her own trap. She had made use of
                  Emory's name to frighten her unprincipled husband, and at the time forgot all
                  about the game she herself was playing with her brother-in law. As the danger
                  which menaced her appeared clearly to her view, she deeply regretted the turn
                  affairs had taken, for it was almost death to her to yield a point to the
                  sarcastic, tantalizing man before her, but there was no help for it, and as he
                  turned to go with a look of triumph on his countenance, she exclaimed—</p>
               <p>'Stay! you have us in your power, and you know it—fool that I was for not using
                  more circumspection, when dealing with the devil! What are your demands?'</p>
               <p>'As I said before,' replied Hollowell, blandly, 'one-third of the gross profits,
                  and a safe refuge in this palace devoted to the black art, will satisfy me at
                  present. I have no doubt I shall be able to assist you materially in your
                  vocation, which has a decided novelty for me, and if you will procure me a fitting
                  disguise I will take your place, when you are not able to attend to business.
                  Cantwell can look after affairs outside, and leave the management of the different
                  departments in the house to us.'</p>
               <p>'I think I fully understand you,' answered Florence, with great disgust, 'and it
                  is requisite that you should also perfectly understand me. I accept the terms you
                  offer, upon one condition, which is that in everything except the business of the
                  house we shall be perfect strangers—if this is satisfactory, well and good—if not,
                  go to Emory, and try your luck with him, but do not forget, at the same time, that
                  the authorities in St. Louis would be glad to learn the particulars of a murder
                  which occurred in that city some time since. You doubtless remember the case—a
                  certain Mrs. Dunscomb received a shot in broad daylight which proved fatal to her,
                  but which was intended for another person?'</p>
               <p>'Dunscomb? Dunscomb?' replied Hollowell, as though endeavoring to recall the
                  circumstance to his mind, 'oh, yes—I <emph>do</emph> remember, now—poor old gal!
                  Killed her almost instantly, didn't it? Pity—pity—wasn't intended for her, though!
                  Well, well,' he continued, again reverting to the matter in hand, 'it's a bargain,
                  so say no more about it—Mons. and Madame Duroc, astrologers—greatest the world
                  ever saw—that's the ticket, ain't it? Hard, though, that such estrangement should
                  exist between man and wife—especially when they are under the same roof. Don't you
                  think you might reconsider that portion of our agreement, Flor.?'</p>
               <p>'Silence, you beast!' was the indignant answer, 'I can only<pb n="202-203"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000102"/> take comfort in the idea that most of the time you
                  will be disguised, and I shall not behold your natural face! Don't even refer to
                  the subject again, or that moment I will break terms with you!'</p>
               <p>'And bow is the other partner in the concern satisfied with this arrangement?'
                  said Hollowell. 'What do you think about it, Cant., eh, old boy? Satisfied?'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' growled Cantwell, 'I suppose I shall have to acknowledge myself satisfied,
                  whether I like it or not.'</p>
               <p>'Very well, then,' said Hollowell, in the best natured manner imaginable, 'let us,
                  while we are together, work in concert. There is no manner of use in one pulling
                  one way and one another: my sole object is to make money, and after I have
                  realized sufficient capital to take me to Paris and to support me there for a
                  while in good style, I will leave you, and (excuse my candor) you may both go to
                  the devil for what I care. Both of you, no doubt, wish to make money, as well as
                  myself, although if I am not mistaken you have another object in view, which I
                  have not. You seek revenge. Now that is a feeling of which I know nothing. I
                  belong to that humble class of individuals who are willing to sacrifice everything
                  to comfort. So long as I have perfect freedom, plenty of money, and a proper place
                  to spend it in, I am content. It is only when I am 'short,' that I feel
                  vindictive. I feel myself justified in taking any means to replenish my purse, but
                  I would not go a step out of my way at any time to procure revenge, which is
                  neither eatable, drinkable, wearable, or fit to sleep upon. I am in favor of the
                  largest liberty, however, and wish all persons to enjoy themselves as suits them
                  best, so long as they do not interfere with me. Although I don't care a fig for
                  revenge myself, I am always willing to assist others in getting it when it costs
                  me nothing, so you two can enjoy revenge and money both, so long as you help me to
                  obtain the latter. I won't ask you how much you've made out of Emory thus far, for
                  I know you will be glad to get rid of me as soon as you can conveniently buy my
                  absence, and this makes such an enquiry useless—nor will I enquire, just at
                  present, why he is your patron—that you can explain at your leisure. All I want
                  just at this moment is a good dinner and a bottle of wine, for I am devilish
                  hungry and somewhat thirsty—so if you have not those commodities in the house,
                  just let Snowball here run out and procure them.'</p>
               <p>'You shall have what you desire,' replied Florence, 'as soon as it can be
                  prepared;' and she was about sending the negro below stairs with the order, when
                  another applicant for hidden knowledge, in the person of a silly shop girl, rang
                  the street door bell, and the two men rushed into the secret room, while Florence
                  closed the open shutter, and prepared to receive her short-sighted and little
                  witted visitor.</p>

               <p>IT was from from no choice of locality apart from other considerations that
                  Estelle fixed upon New Orleans as the place of her destination, but she knew that
                  James Ely had taken that direction, and a desire to learn something of his
                  wanderings was uppermost in her mind—for although she was too proud to make
                  herself known to him even should she ascertain his whereabouts, yet she had not
                  forgotten her early love, and she would have sacrificed much to see him without
                  being seen by him. She knew besides that a thorough search would be made for
                  herself and Kate in New York. She had heard from two or three different sources
                  that Harry Burnton, the<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6405-00000103"/> young man who
                  had offered her his hand previous to her marriage with Emory was looking for her
                  in every direction, and having lost all confidence in the disinterested friendship
                  of mankind, she supposed that he was actuated by the same motives in his desire to
                  find her which had influenced Sam Slocumb. Under these circumstances, she thought
                  that New Orleans, with its mixed and erratic population, would offer her as safe
                  an asylum as any other part of the Union, and under her assumed name, and in the
                  character of a young widow, travelling, with her servant, for amusement, she
                  reached that city, without accident, and having engaged rooms at a fashionable
                  boarding house on St. Charles Street, for herself and Kate, she felt safe from
                  discovery.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Blaisdell was the name of the lady who presided over the affairs of the new
                  home which Estelle had chosen. She was a stout, buxom woman, about forty-five
                  years of age, who although naturally a pleasant, neighborly body enough, had from
                  long familiarity with the business in which she was engaged, contracted a habit of
                  looking at everybody with a suspicious eye till she had by long acquaintance
                  proved them in reality what they seemed to be. This was natural enough, for she
                  had, in her extended experience as a boarding-house keeper been frequently
                  deceived in the very persons with regard to whom her first impressions were the
                  most favorable. This feeling caused her to use much circumspection in her first
                  interview with Estelle. She scrutinized very closely both her and Kate, and asked
                  many questions which the applicant for board considered unwarrantably inquisitive,
                  if not actually impertinent. Being an entire stranger in the city, however, she
                  was anxious to obtain rooms without further trouble, and she answered each
                  interrogatory with as much suavity as she could command, though to say the truth
                  her whole nature had undergone such a complete change that it was difficult for
                  her even to assume a pleasant demeanor. Her proud, fretful, and now vicious heart,
                  chafed at the slightest trifle, and although constant practice for a few weeks had
                  enabled her to veil her discontent beneath a hypocritical smile, the task was a
                  hard one, for she longed to give expression to the spleen which filled her, on
                  every occasion which served to excite it. So, although she managed successfully to
                  pass examination under the careful scrutiny of Mrs. Blaisdell, she hated that lady
                  cordially from the moment that she first set foot in her house, and made up her
                  mind not to stay there any longer than she could possibly help. Not only from her
                  dislike for the landlady, however, did she come to this determination. Another
                  consideration urged her to seek other quarters. She was fearful lest somebody who
                  knew her might find their way into so public a place, and safety demanded that she
                  should not stay too long. She was pretty well guarded against surprise, however,
                  for Kate knew all her friends and was constantly upon the look-out, so that she
                  was sure to be warned of the slightest approach of danger.</p>
               <p>The inmates of Mrs. Blaisdell's boarding house were of the kind generally to be
                  found in similar establishments—persons belonging to no particular class, though
                  all of the highest respectability, and comprising men of leisure and men of
                  business—youths of large expectations and idle habits, and merchants' clerks of no
                  expectations whatever, and exceedingly industrious—merchants and their
                  families—young ladies taking their initiatory lessons at cap-setting from an
                  anxious mother or a maiden aunt, and ladies of a certain age who, if we might take
                  their word for it, wouldn't marry any man living, 'not even if every hair on his
                  head had a diamond attached to the end of it.' Of some of these individuals it
                  will be necessary to make particular mention as our story progresses, and we will
                  commence with noticing Frank Camp, a young shipping merchant, possessing a rather
                  fine appearance and an income of about ten thousand dollars a year—decidedly loose
                  in his morals, (but a great favorite with the ladies nevertheless,) and very fond
                  of attending convivial clubs, horse races, the opera, and<pb n="206-207"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000104"/> such other innocent amusements as the 'fast' youths
                  of large cities have been fond of time out of mind—a practical joker of rather a
                  heartless turn than otherwise, who would gratify his love for what he called fun
                  at whatever cost—even to the crushing of an artless girl's heart—a jolly young
                  bachelor, in fact, who had the name among his acquaintances of being a
                  whole-souled fellow, because he expended his money freely and was always ready for
                  a spree, and who did not care to gain any nobler appellation.</p>
               <p>At the time when Estelle made her appearance at the house of Mrs. Blaisdell, this
                  youth was paying particular attention to a Miss Lydia Dunlap, a young lady well
                  calculated for the wife of such a suitor, inasmuch as she was vain, frivolous, and
                  about as heartless as himself—a girl who was so selfish as actually to feel
                  annoyed at the happiness of another, and so jealous that she never could enjoy
                  herself in company because gentlemen would occasionally address an observation to
                  somebody besides herself. Her father was a wealthy planter, and she had been
                  reared in the lap of luxury and petted, humored and her whims gratified, till she
                  had come to think that she must have everything that she wanted, whether it was
                  possible to obtain it or not—a full sister, in short, to the boy who cried after
                  the moon.</p>
               <p>Well, as we have said, when Estelle made her appearance in the house as a boarder,
                  Frank Camp was a suitor for the hand of Lydia Dunlap, but the first mentioned lady
                  had not been in the house a week, when all the gay youth's attentions were
                  transferred from Lydia to her. This was of course a circumstance calculated to
                  touch so sensitive a young lady as Miss Dunlap in the tenderest point, and
                  accordingly she felt herself called upon to act as spiteful as possible towards
                  everybody with whom she came in contact, but especially towards Estelle, who, in
                  her opinion, merited no lighter punishment than flaying alive for having dared to
                  make her appearance in the house. The idea that a man who had allowed her to jilt
                  him, and even to show utter contempt for him time and time again without taking
                  offence at her conduct, should suddenly transfer his attentions from her to a
                  'fright of a widow,' (this was the epithet she applied to Estelle,) whom nobody
                  knew anything about, and whom nobody should care for if they did, was not to be
                  endured. She declared that it was monstrous—that it was evident enough that
                  Estelle was some base adventuress, travelling about seeking an opportunity to
                  swindle people, and that the fact would appear before a great while, if Mrs.
                  Blaisdell would only keep her wits about her. To say the truth the landlady
                  herself was inclined to favor this view, not because Miss Dunlap had expressed it,
                  for she had sense enough to know what actuated that young lady, but because, as
                  has been observed, she was naturally suspicious, and Estelle had not answered
                  every question to her satisfaction. This feeling spread like an epidemic from one
                  to another throughout the establishment, under the careful promulgation of the
                  slighted belle, and the consequence was that Estelle was subjected to a species of
                  surveillance which rendered her position exceedingly annoying, and she would at
                  once have left the house, had it not been that her combativeness was fully aroused
                  by the treatment she received, and she determined before she did go, that she
                  would give them something to talk about for which they should not be indebted to
                  mere surmise. When Frank Camp first began his marked attentions to her she treated
                  him with a hauteur almost amounting to disdain, and would doubtless have pursued
                  this line of conduct to the end but for the reasons mentioned. When, however, she
                  noticed the bearing of Lydia Dunlap towards her—when she had been openly made the
                  recipient of that young lady's biting inuendoes and petty acts of malice, she
                  resolved at once to encourage the young shipping merchant, although at heart she
                  detested him, for she was not slow to discover that he was an exact counterpart of
                  Sara Slocumb, and only showered his favors<pb n="208-209"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000105"/> vors upon her in the hope eventually of making her
                  the creature of his will.</p>
               <p>Thus affairs stood, when one morning Kate O'Donnell made her appearance in
                  Estelle's room in a state of high excitement. Her hair was dishevelled, her face
                  scratched, her clothes torn, and she bore every appearance of having a hard tussle
                  with somebody.</p>
               <p>'Why Kate,' exclaimed Estelle, 'what has happened? You look as though you had been
                  fighting!'</p>
               <p>'That's thrue for you,' was the answer, 'an' so I have—I'm just after wallopin' a
                  nagar in the kitchen below! But I had a hard job iv it, so I had, for bad cess to
                  the black pate iv her, she was nigh buttin' me brains out!'</p>
               <p>'What led to the difficulty?' questioned Estelle, 'how did the quarrel
                  originate?'</p>
               <p>'Well, thin,' answered Kate, 'it's nothin' but quarrelin' I've had iver since
                  yerseilf and Misther Camp bekem frinds—that milk-faced young lady, Miss Durand,
                  has bin blarneyin' the nagurs with her smiles and her presints, till divil save
                  the wan o' thim that woulden't kill me iv she cud. Jist now, one o' them calt me
                  an Irish thafe and ordered me out o' the kitchen, an' whin I wouldn't go, she
                  grabbed a holt o' me to put me out, and thin me blood riz an' I hot her a lick
                  over the head wid the fryin' pan that stud handy, but it had no effect ownly
                  breakin' the fryin'-pan into smithereens, an' thin, me hand to ye, three o' thim
                  came at me at wance, but I ped no attenshin' to the last two—I sthuck to the wan I
                  med for first, widout mindin' the blows the other two showered upon me, an' whin'
                  I'd pounded her enough to satisfy mesilf I ran away!'</p>
               <p>'And what caused her to call you such opprobrious names?' questioned Estelle,
                  'didn't you provoke her in some way?'</p>
               <p>'I didn't!' answered Kate earnestly—then after a pause she continued—'they wor
                  talkin' agin yerself, so I only thripped wan o' thim up, an' her head sthruck into
                  a pan o' flour that stood upon the hearth, an, O, yer sowl to glory! iv ye'd ownly
                  seen the picture she was!' and Kate indulged in a hearty laugh at the recollection
                  of it.</p>
               <p>'I am very sorry it happened, Kate,' said Estelle, seriously, 'for I have a
                  difficult game to play, and everything depends upon our keeping as quiet as
                  possible. I hope, hereafter, that you will try and keep your temper in check—not
                  that I have any sympathy for the negroes, who might be cut piecemeal for all I
                  should care—but by putting on a show of patience and humility our purpose may be
                  better answered.'</p>
               <p>'I <emph>will</emph> thry,' replied Kate, 'bud iv ye knew how I hate the nagurs!
                  Whisper!' she continued, advancing her mouth close to Estelle's ear, 'Miss Dunlap
                  has hired ivry wan o' thim to watch yersilf and mesilf, an' listen to what we'll
                  say when we're talk-in' together in private. She's med them all sorts o' promises
                  in money an' presints iv they'll find out anything criminal aginuz! I hard her
                  make the offer mesilf whim she didn't think I was near!'</p>
               <p>'Well, for fear any of them should be listening now,' said Estelle, cautiously,
                  'go out in the entry and look carefully around.'</p>
               <p>Kate did as desired, and shortly returned.—'There is none o' thim there now,' she
                  remarked, 'bud ye'd betther sphake low for fear they'd come while we're
                  talking.'</p>
               <p>'It is a good precaution,' observed Estelle, lowering her voice, 'and now, Kate, I
                  think I've hit upon a plan which will put this amiable young lady friend of mine
                  to some trouble. Her object is to get me out of the house. Now it would gratify me
                  exceedingly if I could get the landlady to turn her out and allow me to remain. I
                  think I can do it. The plan is a difficult one, and may fail, perhaps, but I'll
                  try it. Did you ever dress in male attire, Kate?'</p>
               <p>'In a man's clothes, it is?' queried Kate, 'niver!'</p>
               <p>'You wouldn't be afraid to do so, would you?' asked Estelle.</p>
               <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6405-00000106"/>
               <p>'Iv it was to serve you,' replied Kate, 'I'd dress in the devil's clothes.'</p>
               <p>'I wish you could,' remarked Estelle, with a look of hardihood, 'I should be happy
                  to call his Satanic Majesty personally into the service if possible, but I can't,
                  and so we must dispense with his bodily presence, and trust to his spirit to help
                  us. I'll tell you what I want you to do.'</p>
               <p>'Go wan,' said Kate, and then she added cautiously, 'but sphake low, for a
                  nagur'ud hear through a thunder clap.'</p>
               <p>'There is not much difference in our sizes,' resumed Estelle, 'and I have a suit
                  of male clothes in my trunk which I procured before leaving home. I thought they
                  might be useful in a case of emergency. If they do not exactly fit you, you can
                  easily alter them to answer. I wish you to dress in them at once, and take the
                  first opportunity to gain the street unobserved—then take your way to Mr. Camp's
                  place of business on Poydrass street, and hang around there till you see him start
                  out. I am satisfied that he pays very little personal attention to the business of
                  his house—there are other matters doubtless which have a greater charm for him.
                  When you see him leave his establishment, follow him and enter every house that he
                  enters if you can gain admittance. Be careful lest you are detected, for that
                  would of course ruin us. I have great confidence in your wit and sagacity,
                  however, and do not fear any such result. See all you can and hear all you can
                  with safety, and after night has closed in, return here, and report to me the
                  result of your observations. I shall be on the look out for you, and will myself
                  admit you, so that your entrance shall not attract attention. Here are the
                  clothes,' she continued, as she raised the lid of her trunk and took them out—'now
                  dress yourself at once. I will assist you, and I have no doubt we shall succeed in
                  giving you the appearance off 'a marvellous proper man.''</p>
               <p>She then locked the door to prevent any possibility of an abrupt entrance, and the
                  process of transformation began, and shortly ended with complete success, Kate
                  declaring, when she looked in the glass, that 'she wudn't know herself,' and
                  Estelle complimenting her with the observation, that she was 'really a fine
                  looking fellow.'</p>
               <p>The toilet being ended, Estelle went outside to reconnoitre, and after watching
                  for half-an hour or so, a favorable opportunity presented itself, and Kate, in her
                  disguise, gained the street, while Estelle watched her from a front window of one
                  of the upper rooms till she was out of sight, and then returned to her own
                  apartment, to wait, with impatient anxiety her return.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
               <p>As soon as night had fairly set in, Estelle left her room, and proceeding to the
                  parlor she took her seat at one of the windows to watch for the coming of her
                  messenger. At about 9 o'clock she had the satisfaction of seeing the figure of
                  Kate pass the house beneath the strong glare of the street lamp, and then
                  immediately return again to await at a little distance the opening of the door,
                  she having evidently recognised her mistress at the window. It was not long before
                  Estelle found an opportunity to admit her without observation, and a moment
                  afterwards they were once more safely closeted in the room where their
                  consultation took place a few hours before.</p>
               <p>'Well, Kate,' questioned Estelle, in an eager whisper, after<pb n="212-213"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000107"/> the door was carefully locked, 'what success? Did
                  you follow him?'</p>
               <p>'I did folly him,' was the reply, 'an' the divil's own thramp I've had in doin'
                  that same!'</p>
               <p>'Where did he go? Did he enter many houses?' asked Estelle.</p>
               <p>'Iv ye wor afther askin where <emph>didn't</emph> he go, it wud be about as aisy
                  for me to answer,' replied the girl, 'sure he went into a hundred places an' me at

                  ye sind me at all? Sure, I don't see that we've made anything by it!'</p>
               <p>'Have a little patience,' remarked Estelle, 'and you shall know my plans. But
                  first tell me where you went and what you saw.'</p>
               <p>'Well, thin,' replied Kate, 'I hadn't waited 'round his office more nor twinty
                  minits, when he kem out, whistlin' as though he hadn't a throuble in the wide
                  world, and started off at an aisy gate, mesilf of course follyin' a little way
                  behind him. Well, he wint up wan sthreet an' down another, sthopping into hotels

                  dark, he sthopped at a nate house in Bienville sthreet, an' ringing at the dure
                  bell was admitted. Now, I cudn't get in here, iv coorse, because I had no excuse
                  to make, so I jist placed mysilf beside the stheps in the shady o' the house to
                  wait till he'd kem out agin. I wasn't kept waiting long, for presently the dure
                  opened, an' me gintleman med his appearance. 'To-morrow evenin' she'll be here,
                  will she?' ses he to the woman who let him out. 'Tomorrow evening, at six o'clock,
                  widout fail,' ses the woman. 'Thin I'll come,' ses he, 'as sure as me name 's
                  Camp.' 'Iv ye don't, I wudn't give a picayune for your chance afterwards,' ses the
                  woman. 'Good night,' ses he. 'Good night,' ses the woman, an' on he stharted
                  again, mesilf kapin' close to him as before. The next place he sthopped into was a
                  masked ball establishment in the same sthreet, an' here I left him, for I thought
                  it time I was getting back.'</p>
               <p>'Kate, you have managed exceedingly well,' said Estelle, encouragingly, 'and I am
                  highly pleased with you. You got the number of the house where you overheard the
                  conversation, didn't you?'</p>
               <p>'I did,' answered Kate, 'it was No.—.'</p>
               <p>'Very well,' remarked Estelle, 'now I will tell you what I want you to do. You say
                  the servants have been bribed to listen to our private conversations. Now, I want
                  you to lure one of them to listen to-morrow morning. You can easily do it by
                  suddenly passing by her, as if displeased, and at the same time muttering, loud
                  enough for her to hear, my name, coupled with that of the landlady, as though you
                  intended to tell me something which had just transpired. Should this fail, you
                  must try some other plan to gain a listener. Miss Dunlap is anxious to hear
                  something of my history, and I won't keep her in suspense. In the morning I will
                  give you further instructions. Now take off your disguise, and dress yourself in
                  your proper clothes. I shan't want you any longer to-night, and you may spend your
                  time as you think proper, only don't get into any further difficulty with any of
                  the servants. Do you understand, Kate?'</p>
               <p>'I do,' answered the girl; 'divil a word I'll sphake to any o' them.'</p>
               <p>'Well, then, good night,' said Estelle, and leaving Kate to arrange her dress, she
                  took her way to the drawing room, where she was soon engaged in conversation with
                  Mrs. Blais-dell, concerning Kate's quarrel with the kitchen maid.</p>
               <p>'Miss Dunlap tells me,' said the landlady, 'that the whole disturbance originated
                  with your servant, who, set on by you,<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6405-00000108"/>
                  commenced a most violent and unwarrantable assault upon the black girl, Rose.'</p>
               <p>'It is hardly necessary for me to tell you, Madam,' said Estelle, quietly, 'that
                  the statement is entirely false. Miss Dunlap—for what reason I know not, since I
                  have never injured her, by word or deed—takes every opportunity to throw discredit
                  not only upon my servant, but upon myself. Margaret, (it will be remembered by the
                  reader that Kate assumed the name of Margaret Doyle,) it is true, is a wild,
                  uncouth thing, but she never begins a quarrel with any one.'</p>
               <p>'Well,' said Mrs. Blaisdell, 'whatever party may have been in fault, I hope there
                  will be no repetition of the disgraceful affair. My house has always maintained a
                  character for strict order, in every department, and I am not at all willing it
                  should lose its good name.'</p>
               <p>'There is no danger of any further disturbance, as far as Margaret is concerned,'
                  observed Estelle, meekly; 'for I have given her strict orders not to retaliate,
                  even if she is struck. Miss Dunlap shall not again have occasion to complain of
                  her, and I wish her uncalled-for strictures concerning myself were less frequent.
                  But I forgive her.'</p>
               <p>'Miss Dunlap is certainly very severe in her remarks concerning you,' remarked
                  Mrs. Blaisdell; 'but if what she alleges is strictly true, pardon me if I say
                  there is some slight show of reason in her animadversions.'</p>
               <p>'My dear Madam!' exclaimed Estelle, anxiously, 'what has she dared to charge
                  against me specifically?'</p>
               <p>'She charges,' replied Mrs. Blaisdell, 'that your conduct when in company with the
                  gentlemen boarders is exceedingly loose and indelicate; and she goes so far as to
                  intimate that if you are not the wife of Mr. Camp, you ought to be.'</p>
               <p>'Is it possible,' exclaimed Estelle, apparently more in sorrow than in anger,
                  'that she can have allowed her love for scandal to go so far? Why, then,
                  forbearance on my part is no longer a virtue, and I will expose her. Where is Miss
                  Dunlap this evening?'</p>
               <p>'She complained of a headache when she left the room,' answered the landlady, 'and
                  I believe she has retired.'</p>
               <p>A look of gratification rested upon the features of Estelle as she remarked, 'Is
                  not Miss Dunlap frequently afflicted with headache in the evening, of late?'</p>
               <p>'Now you come to speak of it,' answered the landlady, 'I believe she has
                  complained frequently since you came in the house; but surely there is nothing
                  culpable in that.'</p>
               <p>'No', answered Estelle, 'there is nothing very blameable in having a headache; but
                  she certainly takes a very wrong means to get rid of it.'</p>
               <p>'What do you mean?' asked Mrs. Blaisdell, whose curiosity was now greatly
                  excited.</p>
               <p>'Only,' answered Estelle, 'that she is in the habit, occasionally, of visiting a
                  house of assignation in Bienville street—a house, too, of which Mr. Camp is a
                  patron.'</p>
               <p>'Mon-s-t-r-o-u-s!' exclaimed Mrs. Blaisdell, jumping up from her seat, and
                  elevating both hands in her astonishment—'it's impossible—I can't believe it.'</p>
               <p>'I don't wish you to take my word for it,' said Estelle, in a self-possessed tone;
                  'you may have ocular proof of the fact, if you wish it. I am sorry she has forced
                  me into making the exposure; for she is young, and I had a hope that she might see
                  the error of her ways, and turn from them, if not exposed; but I am satisfied,
                  now, that she is beyond reclamation. Her unhappy passion for Mr. Camp has utterly
                  ruined her, and in her anxiety to keep the truth from becoming manifest, she
                  wishes to shift the crime of which she is actually guilty, upon me.'</p>
               <p>'Can it be possible,' said Mrs. Blaisdell, 'that I have such a character in my
                  house? How did you become acquainted with this frightful truth, Mrs. Graham?'</p>
               <p>'By the merest accident,' replied Estelle, 'my servant saw<pb n="216-217"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000109"/> her coming from the house followed by Mr. Camp,
                  this very afternoon, and heard her promise as they parted that she would meet him
                  there again at six o'clock to-morrow evening. I am satisfied that Kate tells the
                  truth, but it is easy enough to remove every doubt by watching and following
                  her.'</p>
               <p>'So it is,' answered the landlady, 'and I will do it. If I find that she is indeed
                  the character you represent her to be, she can no longer stay under my roof—but
                  you will oblige me by not mentioning this circumstance to any body, for let her be
                  as bad as she may, I do not wish to offend her parents, who are quite wealthy, by
                  exposing her. I shall have to get rid of them by pleading inability to accommodate
                  them any longer.'</p>
               <p>'Heaven knows that I would rather conceal than publish her shame,' said Estelle,
                  with assumed sorrow, 'and I would not have mentioned the matter at all except to
                  protect my own honor.'</p>
               <p>At this point in the conversation Mr. Camp entered the room, and the landlady
                  disappeared.</p>
               <p>'Good evening, Mrs. Graham,' said the libertine, taking a seat near her.</p>
               <p>She did not respond to the salutation, and noticing the look of despondency which
                  her features wore, and which she had put on purposely as he entered, he
                  continued—</p>
               <p>'Heavens! my dear madam, how exceedingly ill you look! Shall I not summon a
                  physician?'</p>
               <p>'No sir, I thank you,' she answered dejectedly. 'I will not deny that I feel
                  unwell, but I fear that my malady is not to be reached by medicine.'</p>
               <p>'My dear Mrs. Graham,' said the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">roue,</foreign> with great
                  apparent solicitude, 'you alarm me! What has happened to distress you?'</p>
               <p>'Nothing unusual,' sighed Estelle, with a look of meek resignation; 'ever since I
                  first sat foot in this house I have been the victim of misrepresentation and
                  calumny, and I have only been subjected to a fresh assault to day, that's
                  all.'</p>
               <p>'Who has dared to slander you?' enquired Camp, with warmth—'but I think I can
                  guess—that frivolous mischief-maker, Miss Dunlap, has been busy with her
                  calumny.'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' replied Estelle, 'and you are the cause of it. She charges me with being
                  too free with you.'</p>
               <p>'Well, never mind her,' said Camp, soothingly, 'she is well known, and her
                  mischievous gabble can do you but little harm.'</p>
               <p>'I wish I could think as you do,' replied Estelle, sorrowfully, 'but, alas! the
                  world is too apt to take sides against the weak and friendless. Miss Dunlap is
                  both rich and powerful, and has many warm friends, while I am alone in the world,
                  and have not the reputation of great wealth to protect me.'</p>
               <p>'My dear Mrs. Graham!' Exclaimed Camp, with ardor, at the same time attempting to
                  take her hand, 'do not say that you are friendless, while I live! You may command
                  my wealth—my life! for (pardon the temerity which leads me to make the bold
                  declaration upon so short an acquaintance,) I love you!'</p>
               <p>'Ah, this is what I feared!' said Estelle, with a show of apprehension, 'this it
                  is which causes Miss Dunlap to hate me—the demon of jealousy is awakened in her
                  breast, and nothing will satisfy her but my utter destruction. Oh, sir, strive to
                  conquer your unhappy passion for me, and bestow your affection upon her to whom it
                  properly belongs.'</p>
               <p>'She to whom it properly belongs,' urged Camp, 'has it already—I sought the hand
                  of Miss Dunlap in marriage, and would have married her—may yet marry her,
                  perhaps—but not because I ever have loved or ever can love her. She is a doll—a
                  plaything—a brainless girl—and my love seeks a nobler object for its idolatry; so,
                  although I might go through a frivolous ceremony with her to possess myself of her
                     wealth,<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6405-00000110"/> I should still love you, and
                  you only, and her wealth should minister to your grandeur.'</p>
               <p>They were sitting with their backs to the light, and the full play of their
                  features could not be seen, but could Camp have witnessed the mingled expression
                  of scorn, contempt, and bitter hate which rested upon the features of the
                  passionate young creature he was addressing, he would have regretted that he had
                  allowed his speech to take so bold a shape. He anticipated a rebuke, but not a
                  harsh one, for like too many of his class he had but a poor opinion of the virtue
                  of women—his intrigues during his career of vice and debauchery had been rather
                  successful, and this had made him bold to imprudence, so that while he feared
                  Estelle might at first chide his boldness, he never doubted that he should
                  eventually, by the aid of his wealth, flattery and good looks, succeed in the
                  accomplishment of his design. The effect upon Estelle was terrible, and it took
                  all her determined self-will to keep her from openly giving expression to her
                  feelings. She had a deep game to play, however, and after a severe struggle with
                  her passion, she managed so far to control herself as to answer, without any show
                  of displeasure—</p>
               <p>'I may at some time or other have occasion to test your friendship, and as you
                  have been so kind as to manifest it thus openly I shall not fail to call upon you,
                  but in the meantime I beg that you will be less marked in your attentions to me.
                  This will not only render the calumnies of Miss Dunlap powerless, but it will lead
                  her to treat me with more consideration, for I know that all her dislike of me
                  springs from jealousy. Will you endeavor to gratify me so far?'</p>
               <p>'What would I not do to gratify you?' exclaimed Camp, passionately; 'hereafter,
                  even in your presence, although the task will render me sick at heart, I will
                  lavish every endearment upon her. I will commence to-morrow, if you say so, the
                  disagreeable duty.'</p>
               <p>'Ah, now I feel that you love me,' sighed Estelle, with assumed fondness.</p>
               <p>'Love you!' exclaimed Camp, 'I adore you!' and he was about clasping her in his
                  arms, when they heard a footstep descending the stairs, and a moment afterwards
                  Mrs. Blais-dell entered the room, and seating herself at the piano, began playing
                  the latest fashionable air.</p>
               <p>'Tell me,' said Estelle, resuming the conversation with Camp, after a few moments
                  of profound thought, 'did you ever, in the course of your business as a shipping
                  merchant, become acquainted with a young man of the name of Ely?'</p>
               <p>'Ely—Ely,' replied Camp, thoughtfully, 'if I am not mistaken there was a young man
                  of that name—James Ely, I think—who shipped some years since as clerk on board a
                  vessel bound for Barbadoes.'</p>
               <p>'That is he!' exclaimed Estelle, eagerly, 'do you know anything of him?'</p>
               <p>'All I know is this,' replied Camp, 'the vessel was lost at sea, and it is
                  supposed that all on board perished except the first mate, who was picked up by a
                  home ward-bound vessel after clinging to a piece of the wreck forty-eight
                  hours.'</p>
               <p>'O, my God!' exclaimed Estelle, clasping her hands wildly, 'then I am indeed alone
                  in the world!'</p>
               <p>'Why, was the young man a relative of yours?' enquired Camp, somewhat surprised at
                  the earnestness of Estelle.</p>
               <p>'He was,' she answered sadly, 'an only brother. Excuse me, sir, but I must indulge
                  the grief which this revelation gives me, alone. Good night!' and rising, she
                  sadly withdrew, and took the way to her own apartment.</p>
               <p>When she had reached her room and locked the door, she seated herself, and
                  indulged in a long train of bitter reflections, which ended in a copious flow of
                  tears. Suddenly calling up an expression of stoicism, however, she checked her
                  grief, and muttered to herself, 'What have I to do with tears! I never thought to
                  have shed one again, and I hope I shall never hereafter<pb n="220-221"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000111"/> after be guilty of a similar weakness. My heart
                  must be stone—adamant—dead to all sympathetic feeling—and if I weep tears they
                  must be tears of blood! It is better as it is, for while I thought he was alive
                  some stray feelings of remorse lingered in my nature which tended to hold me in
                  check, but now that he is gone, I can pluck them out root and branch, and yield
                  myself up, soul and body, to the guidance of the furies, who would seem to have
                  controlled my fate from my infancy! Tremble, all ye who cross my path hereafter,
                  for my only study now is vengeance!' and amid thoughts such as these, she
                  stretched herself upon her bed, and was soon in an uneasy slumber, broken by
                  dreams of a wild and frightful nature.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
               <p>THE next morning, she awoke unrefreshed and unhappy, and at an early hour Kate
                  O'Donnell knocked at the door for admission. Estelle admitted her, and as Kate
                  entered she laid her finger upon her lip in token of her desire that silence
                  should be observed, and whispered, exultingly—</p>
               <p>'Now we have thim! A nagur follyed me frim the kitchen, an' I holt ye for a guinea

               <p>'So far, so good,' whispered Estelle in return, 'now I wish to hold a conversation
                  loud enough for her to hear, which will lead Miss Dunlap to suppose, when it is
                  retailed to her, that the keeper of the house in Bienville street, which Camp is
                  in the habit of visiting, knows something about me. Do you understand?'</p>
               <p>'I do,' answered Kate, 'niver fear—commince.'</p>
               <p>Estelle then raised her voice and exclaimed, somewhat sharply—</p>
               <p>'Why, Margaret, what in the world has brought you here at this hour in the
                  morning? Why don't you learn to wait till I call for you?'</p>
               <p>'The nagurs down stairs wor talkin' agin ye,' answered Kate, 'an' they riz me

               <p>'Well, never mind what they say about me,' replied Estelle—'they don't know
                  anything against me, and it isn't likely they ever will, for there isn't a person
                  in New Orleans who knows anything about my real character with the exception of
                  the woman at No.—Bienville street, and she wouldn't reveal anything unless she was
                  pretty well paid for it. But even that danger will be removed shortly, for she
                  leaves here at 6 o'clock this evening, and then I have nothing to fear—so let them
                  talk on, for until they can find something against me in reality, their idle
                  clatter will not amount to much.'</p>
               <p>'Sphake lower!' said Kate, slightly dropping her voice, and assuming a cautious
                  tone, 'some o' thim might be list'nin' to you.'</p>
               <p>'I did come near forgetting myself,' said Estelle, 'and hereafter I must be more
                  careful. I would not have been overheard for the world. Go, Kate, and see if any
                  one is hanging about the door.'</p>
               <p>Kate went leisurely to the door, which she opened just in time to catch a glimpse
                  of the woolly pate of one of the house servants as it disappeared below the first
                  flight of steps.</p>
               <p>'Sure I knew the black divil 'ud be list'nin',' said Kate, exultingly, as she
                  returned, 'for she's been follyin' me all over<pb n="222-223"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000112"/> this mornin'—shtickin' to me like me own shadie—an'
                  it won't be tin minits before Miss Dunlap has the whole story.'</p>
               <p>'Now all I have to fear is,' said Estelle, 'that Miss Dunlap may take it into her
                  head to communicate what she hears to Mrs. Blaisdell. This would ruin us entirely,
                  and must be prevented. It is a matter which I can manage easily enough, however. I
                  will seek out Mrs. Blaisdell, and keep close to her all day. My enemy would not
                  undertake to make the revelation in my presence lest it should put me on my guard,
                  and enable me to prevent the truth from coming to light. She will therefore
                  attempt to take me by surprise by fortifying herself with testimony. The
                  landlady's bearing towards her will also favor my plot. After what I told her last
                  night, she will be very likely to treat Miss Dunlap somewhat coldly. This will
                  cause the latter young lady to keep her information to herself through spite, and
                  nothing in the world will then prevent her from falling into the snare which I
                  have laid for her. Now, Kate, be sure to observe a very meek demeanor all day, and
                  do nothing which would be likely to excite the slightest suspicion.'</p>
               <p>'I'll play my part well, never fear,' said Kate, as she left the room and took her
                  way to the kitchen, where her appearance was the signal for a titter of contempt
                  from the wench who had shortly before played eavesdropper. Kate didn't mind her,
                  however, but bore all her taunts, as well as the witty allusions and sarcastic
                  remarks of the rest of the ebony-hued company with the most exemplary
                  patience.</p>
               <p>Estelle made her appearance in the parlor much earlier than usual, and at once
                  began forming pretences in her own mind which might serve to keep her near the
                  landlady without at the same time exciting any suspicion. She was very successful,
                  and by the time they all met at breakfast she regarded the game as hers, and felt
                  as safe as though she had already won it. Miss Dunlap's face wore an air of
                  complete triumph, and she was so elated with joy that her coffee went untasted,
                  while Estelle made herself as agreeable as possible to Mrs. Blaisdell, and treated
                  her enemy with the most perfect disdain.</p>
               <p>'O,' thought Miss D., 'you smile sweetly now, and are extremely pleasant; but your
                  face will wear another aspect before you go to bed to-night!'</p>
               <p>'Minx,' muttered Estelle, 'you have set a trap to catch yourself in, and dearly
                  will you rue your despicable conduct towards me. Would that evening were
                  come!'</p>
               <p>Had Miss Dunlap's parents been at home, Estelle would not have dared to try the
                  dangerous experiment which she had commenced, but she knew they were out of town,
                  and would not probably be back in some days. So after preventing the possibility
                  of the jealous girl's making Mrs. Blaisdell her confidant, she felt perfectly
                  secure, for she knew that there was not another person in the house with whom her
                  enemy was on friendly terms.</p>
               <p>The day wore on, and the plot worked exactly as Estelle expected it would. On two
                  or three different occasions, Miss Dunlap, with a malicious sneer upon her
                  features, approached the landlady and attempted to draw her away from Estelle, but
                  Mrs. Blaisdell treated her with extreme coldness at each offer, and at length in a
                  fit of wounded pride and indignation she gave up the attempt.</p>
               <p>As the hour of six approached, fortunately for the plan of Estelle, Lydia Dunlap
                  again complained of illness, and retired to her room, while significant glances
                  passed between the landlady and Estelle, who at once commenced preparing
                  themselves to follow her. She had but just completed their preparations, when
                  Estelle, on peeping cautiously through the window blinds, observed the negro
                  servant, who had played the listener, emerge from the basement, and after casting
                  a glance of scrutiny up at the windows, move rapidly off down the street. For a
                  moment, Estelle's heart sunk within her, for she was fearful that Lydia had
                  determined to send the wench instead of going herself, but this fear was dispelled
                  almost as soon as felt, for<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6405-00000113"/> immediately
                  afterwards, Miss Dunlap herself, closely veiled, emerged in the same way, and
                  Estelle was then satisfied that the negro only acted as a sort of pioneer.</p>
               <p>'I believe she intends to take one of the servants with her this time,' whispered
                  Estelle—'the black girl, Rose, went out just ahead of her, and I shall miss my
                  guess if they do not meet again.'</p>
               <p>'Shall we start now?' enquired Mrs. Blaisdell, who was nervous from
                  excitement.</p>
               <p>'Not just yet,' answered Estelle. 'I think we had better let them turn the corner
                  before we venture out, and then there will be no danger of their seeing us.'</p>
               <p>After waiting a moment they started out, and walking swiftly to the next corner,
                  they had the game safely in sight, and kept them so, till sure enough, they
                  brought up at the infamous house of Mrs. ——, in Bienville street, where, after
                  ringing, both were admitted.</p>
               <p>'I can hardly believe my eyes!' exclaimed Mrs. Blaisdell—'the shameless creature!
                  She shan't stay in my house another day after her parents get back! I have seen
                  enough—let us go back again.'</p>
               <p>'Let us wait for a few moments,' said Estelle, persuasively, 'perhaps we may learn
                  who it is she goes to meet.'</p>
               <p>The ladies were both veiled deeply, but further to avoid observation as much as
                  possible, they entered a fancy store, and while Estelle was engaged in making some
                  unimportant purchases, Mrs. Blaisdell posted herself at the door, and, under
                  pretence of watching for a friend, directed her gaze towards the house which they
                  had under surveillance.</p>
               <p>She had not watched long, when suddenly the door of the disreputable abode opened,
                  and the negro girl Rose came rushing out in a hurried manner, as though very much
                  frightened at something. She was almost instantly followed by Miss Dunlap, who
                  bore the appearance of having been rather roughly handled, her hat being awry and
                  her hair somewhat disordered, and she in her turn was followed by Mr. Frank Camp,
                  who was seemingly somewhat intoxicated, and who followed Lydia up till he got by
                  her side, when, both seemingly in a bad humor, they walked rapidly towards the
                  store at the door of which Mrs. Blaisdell was standing. She changed her position
                  as they approached, so that they could not see her, and as they passed, she heard
                  Camp remark—</p>
               <p>'That place'll do very well to meet me in sometimes, but not always. Why didn't
                  you let me know——'</p>
               <p>The remainder of the speech was lost, but Mrs. Blaisdell had heard sufficient to
                  convince her that her worst suspicions were more than confirmed, and calling to
                  Estelle, they started forth, and taking a different direction from that in which
                  Camp and Lydia had gone, they struck a brisk walk and managed to get in the house
                  and divest themselves of their street dress, just as Lydia slyly entered at the
                  basement, and noiselessly took her way to her own room.</p>
               <p>Lydia had been terribly frightened and somewhat maltreated, but with the exception
                  of a sound lesson in wisdom, she had not learned much. The fates had favored
                  Estelle, and everything had turned out better, far better, than she had
                  anticipated. It had so happened that just at the time when Lydia and her black
                  attendant entered the house in Bienville street, Frank Camp and a woman whom he
                  had met there by appointment, were coming down stairs. Lydia recognised him at
                  once, and forgetting herself, she uttered a scream. This attracted the attention
                  of Camp's companion, who was of an exceedingly jealous turn of mind, and when she
                  noticed that her lover recognised Lydia, she attacked her and her servant with the
                  fury of a tigress, and drove them from the house. Thus Miss Dunlap was left
                  entirely in the dark as to the revelation which she had hoped her money would
                  purchase, and furthermore she remembered that according to the information which
                  Rose had given her, the person from whom she had hoped to obtain the important
                  revealment would leave town<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6405-00000114"/> at six
                  o'clock. To add to her chagrin she could not disabuse Camp of the idea that she
                  had called there purposely to see him. He was vain enough to believe anything, and
                  he imagined that Lydia had sent a spy to watch him, and having found out his place
                  of resort, had determined to brave everything and seek him there. In vain she told
                  him that she had gone there to obtain an important secret concerning the widow
                  lady, Mrs. Graham. He knew how cordially she hated Estelle, and argued within
                  himself that she only resorted to this statement in order to injure that lady's
                  character. It was with difficulty she could persuade him to leave her to pursue
                  her way home alone, and when at length he did part from her, he cautioned her to
                  be more careful in future, and advised her the next time she wanted to see him to
                  send him notice beforehand, and he would appoint a place where they might meet
                  without fear of molestation. All this, it may be believed, nettled the proud girl
                  not a little, and when she reached home and found herself safely in her own room
                  her overcharged heart relieved itself by an outburst of the most violent grief.
                  She sought her bed, but she endeavored in vain to find relief in sleep, for the
                  events of the day would rush into her mind one after another in spite of her
                  endeavors to shut them out. She felt that she had degraded herself in pursuing the
                  course which she had taken, and the bitterest reflection of all to her was that
                  she had no possible way of getting satisfaction. She regretted that she had not
                  spoken to the landlady in the morning, for then there was a slight possibility
                  that her story might have been believed, but she did not dare to mention it now,
                  for she knew that her proof was gone, and a mere repetition of what the negress
                  had heard would amount to nothing, for it would have been set down as a lie
                  originated by the servant to get the good will of her mistress. Every way she
                  looked at the subject it presented an aspect which rendered her utterly miserable,
                  and when she made her appearance the next day her countenance wore a haggard and
                  care-worn look which might well indicate guilt. Her life, after this, beneath the
                  roof of Mrs. Blaisdell, was a perfect burden to her, and when in the course of a
                  couple of weeks her parents returned to take up their abode with her, she was,
                  much to the landlady's relief, the first one to beg that they would seek other
                  quarters and take her with them. She gave no other reason for her desire to leave
                  than that she had grown tired of staying so long in one place, and when they found
                  that they could not argue her out of what they termed her strange notion, they
                  gratified her by removing, and Estelle had the extreme gratification of seeing
                  them all out of the house.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
               <p>THREE months passed before Estelle had so far arranged her plans as to wish to
                  leave the house in which she commenced her career in New Orleans. During that time
                  she had, after much deep thought and frequent conferences with Kate, from whose
                  shrewd suggestions she not unfrequently derived much benefit, marked out her
                  future course, and determined to pursue it. She was not long in discovering that
                  in order to live, and to live well, it was necessary that she should have money,
                  and plenty of it. She would be obliged to send remittances regularly to the
                  address of Mrs. Gardener for the support of her child—not that she loved her
                  offspring—on the contrary, she had learned to hate it, for the thought that
                     <emph>his</emph> blood ran in its veins, rankled in her heart, destroying every
                  motherly feeling—but she knew that it would gratify Emory to gain possession of
                  it, and she was fearful that a dearth of money<pb n="228-229"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000115"/> for its support would lead Mrs. Gardener to
                  advertise it, and in that case she could easily foresee the event. So she wanted
                  money, for her own limited stock was running low, and she knew of no occupation
                  which she could follow to acquire more. Under these circumstances, she determined
                  to resort to stratagem. She had no great love for virtue as a principle now, but
                  she hated the men who would make merchandise of her charms, and as she could not
                  always take a bloody revenge upon them, she determined to punish by swindling
                  them. In short, she made up her mind that such characters should support her
                  handsomely, without any other return for the accommodation upon her part than an
                  effort to injure them whenever an opportunity offered. She had determined to make
                  Camp her first victim, and having used him as far as she conveniently could, it
                  was her purpose to seek elsewhere for fresh subjects.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, after she had succeeded in driving the Dunlaps from the house, she
                  began cautiously to approach Camp, whose ardor so far from decreasing, seemed to
                  gain new vigor every day. She had a more favorable field to operate in, for not
                  only was she freed from the system of espionage which Lydia had pursued, but Mrs.
                  Blaisdell had grown less suspicious of her, and did not watch her half so closely
                  as before. The generalship which she pursued in her intercourse with Camp was most
                  admirable for so young a tactician, for while she led him to hope for everything,
                  she granted nothing. She suffered him to whisper his fulsome flattery and
                  insulting wishes in her ear, and yet kept him at a respectful distance, never
                  compromising herself by accepting the costly presents which he from time to time
                  pressed her to accept. This course she knew would not answer always, and at length
                  one evening, about two months after she had commenced to angle for him in earnest,
                  she, after much hesitation and great apparent reluctance, told him that she was
                  about to test the truth of the declarations which he had on one occasion long
                  before made to her.</p>
               <p>'My dear Madame!' exclaimed he, eagerly, 'how can I assist you? Consider me the
                  slave of your will—mention your wish and it shall be gratified as soon as made
                  known, if the thing is possible.'</p>
               <p>'Well,' replied Estelle, seemingly much embarrassed, 'I have for some time past
                  been expecting remittances from New York, but I have this day received a letter
                  from my agent, who informs me that my business affairs are in so complicated a
                  state that it will be impossible for him to send me the money which I need, for
                  some time to come. I have present use for a thousand dollars, and I thought that
                  you might advance that sum. I know it is a delicate matter, and I hope you will
                  excuse my apparent boldness, but I have no friend to whom I can apply in my
                  emergency, and this must be my excuse for troubling you.'</p>
               <p>'Don't mention it, my dear Mrs. Graham, I beg of you!' exclaimed Camp, eagerly, 'I
                  shall be only too happy to accommodate you at anytime. Whenever you stand in need
                  of a loan only notify me a day or two beforehand, and you can not only have it,
                  but I will consider myself the obliged party. Fortunately I have the amount which
                  you require about me,' and taking the notes from his wallet, he presented them.
                  'All the interest I ask,' he continued, as he replaced his pocket-book, and
                  inclined his head towards her, 'is that which all votaries of love expect from the
                  boy-god—gratification!' and as he finished speaking, before she was aware of it,
                  he impressed a kiss upon her lips. Disgust and rage were busy in her heart, but
                  she smothered them for a time, and a look of satisfaction glistened in her eyes,
                  as she thanked him, and arose to withdraw.</p>
               <p>'But, Mrs. Graham—Julia!' he exclaimed, as she bade him good-nig-ht, 'is our sweet
                  communion to end so suddenly? Will you not grant me a few moments——'</p>
               <p>'I will see you again to-morrow evening,' was the abrupt manner in which she cut
                  short his speech; 'at present I have<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6405-00000116"/>
                  some business of importance to arrange, and I know you will excuse me.'</p>
               <p>Estelle had every reason to feel gratified with the success of her first effort,
                  and it was not long before she made a second which was equally successful. She
                  represented to Camp that she had a grand project in view, which could not be
                  carried out without money, and that it would not be a great while before she would
                  repay him. The first part of this statement was true, but the second part was
                  not—she <emph>had</emph> a great project in view—no less a one than to procure the
                  means of living without working for it, but as to paying him, in the literal sense
                  of that term, that was another matter. To say the truth, Camp, although a rich
                  man, was an extravagant one, and found use during each year for an immense amount
                  of money; he therefore began to feel rather uneasy about the large sums which he
                  had from time to time handed over to Estelle without a return, and when, about
                  three months after the first loan, she made application to him for another
                  thousand, he, for the first time, complained of the tightness of the money-market,
                  then demurred at the pertinacious manner in which Estelle continued to avoid him,
                  and finally refused flatly to accommodate her again, except upon the condition
                  that she would immediately thereafter elope and take up her residence with
                  him.</p>
               <p>Estelle did not seem at all startled at the bold proposition, but she hesitated at
                  first—spoke of the impropriety of such a course—expressed her fears that her
                  conduct might become known, and her character blasted—and finally agreed to his
                  terms with perfect willingness. She received another thousand dollars—the night
                  for the elopement fixed upon—and Frank Camp departed highly delighted, and
                  flattering himself that he had not made a bad investment.</p>
               <p>What a silly dolt your man of the world is, after all the experience of which he
                  can boast! His knowledge of character—his sharp-sightedness—and his extreme
                  caution, are nothing in comparison to the wit of a determined woman who resolves
                  to deceive him. Estelle, for a whole week previous to the last loan, had been
                  making preparations to leave the house of Mrs. Blaisdell. She had watched the
                  newspapers carefully, and having seen furnished rooms advertised in Chartres
                  street, she had made application for and secured them, with the understanding that
                  she could take possession whenever it suited her. Her arrangements were all made,
                  and having settled up her bill with Mrs. Blaisdell, on the very morning after her
                  agreement with Camp, she had her things removed. Mrs. Blaisdell had not the
                  slightest interest in Estelle's affairs—she had got her money, and that was all
                  she cared for. She naturally enquired, however, where Estelle was about to take up
                  her abode, and received as an answer a direction precisely the opposite of the
                  true one. Compliments were then exchanged between them—a carriage which had been
                  sent for drove up to the door—the trunks were got out and fastened on—Estelle and
                  Kate jumped in—the whip cracked—the horses started—and when Mr. Camp found his way
                  home that evening, it was to learn that for once in his life, at least, he had
                  been made 'egregiously an ass.'</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
               <p>THE landlord of the new residence in which Estelle hail taken her abode was a Mr.
                  Anthony (or Tony as he was familiarly called) Butters, and Estelle recognized in
                  him, on the first day she saw him, when she made application for the premises, a
                  fit subject for victim No. 2—this was one reason, indeed, why she had so readily
                  taken the rooms. She had started in a new business and she determined to follow it
                  up industriously, inasmuch as it was rather pleasant than otherwise, and promised
                  to pay well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Butters was a short, obese individual, about fifty years of age, with a
                  smooth, fat, round face, and a little, nut-like head, the top of which was bald,
                  and shone like a looking-glass. His phrenological developments plainly indicated
                  that the animal passions predominated largely, while his lymphatic temperament
                  betokened a love of ease and indolence. Mr. Butters was a rich man, but he was
                  also a stingy one, and was not, as a general thing, apt to lay out his money
                  extravagantly. Had this not been the case he would have indulged his family
                  (consisting of a wife and two grown-up daughters) in the luxury of an entire
                  house, instead of renting out a suite of rooms. But there was one way in which the
                  pockets of Mr. Butters could be reached. Alas, that the truth must be told, he was
                  not only exceedingly amative, but ridiculously vain, and a few words of flattery
                  from a pair of pretty lips, would at any time turn his brain topsy-turvy. As has
                  been before observed he was constitutionally lazy and inactive, but this defect
                  vanished when in the presence of beauty, and he never saw a pretty woman that he
                  did not at once attempt to lay siege to her heart, by indulging in the most
                  extravagant and ludicrous airs and speeches.</p>
               <p>Such being the character of Mr. Butters it will readily be believed that he was
                  overjoyed at the idea of getting as a tenant so fair and apparently so impressible
                  a widow lady as Estelle, but a month had not rolled around after her first
                  appearance in his house, when he bitterly regretted that he had ever seen her, for
                  she not only <emph>patronized</emph> him to the extent of a thousand dollars, but
                  exposed him to his family besides. Thus it was. Estelle encouraged the too
                  susceptible Butters from the first moment she set foot within his premises, but as
                  had been her plan with her first victim, she kept him at a respectful distance.
                  She received his visits without hesitation, listened to his senseless rigmarole
                  with apparent pleasure, and allowed him, although with some show of resistance, to
                  occasionally squeeze her hand. When she had angled with till she had hooked him,
                  she managed to have her trunk conveyed by stealth to furnished apartments on Camp
                  street—then she borrowed a thousand dollars from him, <emph>to test his
                     love</emph> (she knew that this was about as far as she could go with
                     <emph>him,</emph>) and the next night, which was to have rendered him
                  superlatively happy, she eloped, accompanied by Kate, and he awoke to a true sense
                  of his position, the unpleasantness of which was vastly increased when his wife
                  received a letter from Estelle, detailing the whole matter just as it actually
                  occurred, and winding up with the declaration that she did not hardly think a
                  thousand dollars paid her for listening such a length of time to the insane
                  ravings of such an unmitigated old thickskull—such a<pb n="234-235"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000118"/> disgusting old beast. This was the unkindest cut of
                  all, and Butters, who fairly groaned under it, swore with a terrible oath that he
                  would have revenge if it cost him every cent he was worth in the world to obtain
                  it.</p>
               <p>While all this was going on Frank Camp was anathematizing Estelle's duplicity and
                  his own luck, and trying his best to find out the run-away's hiding place. He did
                  not wish to make any inquiries concerning her at the boarding-house, for this
                  would have excited suspicion, and he would not have had his weakness exposed for
                  ten times the amount of money which he had lost. Had the story become public he
                  would have been made the laughing stock of his companions, and this he could not
                  have borne. Besides he shrewdly suspected, and, as the reader knows, not without
                  reason, that Estelle had not been foolish enough to leave her address, so all hope
                  of information from that quarter was cut off. For nearly a month he studied
                  constantly how he might discover her retreat, and he was about to give up the idea
                  as hopeless, when suddenly a happy thought occured to him—he would advertise for
                  the backman who had conveyed her from Mrs. Blaisdell's establishment, whose
                  appearance he doubted not a liberal reward would secure. Happy thought! why had it
                  not occurred to him before? It was no sooner conceived than executed, and with the
                  hoped-for result too, but unfortunately for Camp, Estelle discovered the
                  advertisement before he could secure an interview with the hackman, and the result
                  was that Camp found his way to the house of Mr. Butters the very day after the
                  bird had flown. The latter gentleman was just about going out when Camp mounted
                  the steps to ring at the street door bell, and the two duped individuals met each
                  other face to face in the door-porch.</p>
               <p>'Is there a widow lady of the name of Graham residing here?' enquired Camp,
                  anxiously.</p>
               <p>'No,' answered the little fat man, in a tone of ill-concealed rage, 'there was
                  such a person residing here, but she left yesterday terday—and between you and me,
                  stranger, I'd give my right arm to know where she is at this moment.'</p>
               <p>'I can't say I'd go quite so far as that,' said Camp, attempting to get up a
                  smile, which however, was a decided failure, 'but I'd give considerable in the way
                  of money for such information.'</p>
               <p>'If I may make so bold,' said Butters abruptly, 'what may be your business with
                  the lady?'</p>
               <p>'Excuse me,' answered Camp, 'but that is just the enquiry I was about to make of
                  you.'</p>
               <p>Instantly the idea occurred to both men at once that they stood respectively in
                  about the same relation towards the lady, and a sort of 'misery loves company'
                  smile of satisfaction rested upon the features of each, as one stood waiting for
                  the other to recommence the conversation. At length Butters 'grinned horribly a
                  ghastly smile,' and merely saying, 'Good day, sir!' took his departure and left
                  Camp in a sort of bewilderment standing upon the steps.</p>
               <p>'Well, if she has fooled that old fellow the same as she did me,' he muttered, as
                  he turned his face towards his place of business, '<emph>she'll do to
                     travel,</emph> and that man will be sharp indeed who gets the better of
                  her!'</p>
               <p>While her two dupes were endeavoring to 'digest the venom of their spleen,'
                  Estelle was laughing in her sleeve at her new apartments in Camp street. The
                  business of fleecing began to have an indescribable charm for her, and she could
                  not help wishing that she had the task of swindling Messrs. Camp and Butters to do
                  over again. This she knew, however, was impossible, and she was fain to cast about
                  her for some fresh victim. But in what direction to look for one was a thing that
                  now sadly puzzled her. There was not a man in the new abode which she had chosen
                  whose purse she could hope to reach, and finally after mature reflection she
                  determined, with a boldness characteristic of her, to seek her victims
                  outside.</p>
               <p>'Kate,' she said, addressing the Irish girl, one evening,<pb n="236-237"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000119"/> about a week after she had left the house of Mr.
                  Butters, 'I am going out to-night.'</p>
               <p>'An' where are ye goin'?' asked Kate, in some surprise.</p>
               <p>'I am going to the masquerade ball in Bienville street,' replied Estelle. 'If the
                  mountain will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet will go to the mountain—I am going to
                  seek my game in their own haunts.'</p>
               <p>'Shure it's crazy ye are to think iv it,' said Kate, evidently alarmed.</p>
               <p>'Not at all,' answered Estelle, 'I shall go in the same dress which you wore when
                  you followed Camp, and I have not the slightest fear of detection. Perhaps I shall
                  meet him there. I hope so; I may pick up some information which will enable me to
                  relieve him of a few more thousands—who knows?'</p>
               <p>'Ye'd betther take my advice, and not go, Misthress, dear,' said Kate,
                  persuasively, 'shure, I'll be frightened out o' the life o' me, till ye get back
                  agin.'</p>
               <p>'Oh, pshaw!' exclaimed Estelle, confidently, 'don't you be alarmed. I know what
                  I'm about, and will be very careful, both for my own sake and for yours. Come, get
                  the clothes and help to dress me, for in about an hour it will be time for me to
                  start out.'</p>
               <p>Thus ordered, Kate obeyed, but it was with a heavy heart, and even when the
                  dressing was finished, and she saw how complete was Estelle's disguise, she was
                  still ill at ease, and as night set in, and her mistress started off, she could
                  not help again warning her—</p>
               <p>'Kape yer eyes forninst ye, misthress dear,' she whispered, 'an' don't be afther
                  lettin' any blagard lade ye asthray. Walk wid a big sthride, stick a cigar in the
                  corner o' yer mouth—ye needn't smoke it, d'ye mind—an' don't shpake more nor ye
                  can help—d'ye mind?'</p>
               <p>'Never fear, Kate,' was the confident answer, 'I shall be careful enough, I
                  warrant you. Good-bye!'</p>
               <p>'Good-bye, an' good luck to ye,' cried Kate, and the next moment Estelle was
                  walking leisurely along through Camp street with as much self-possession as though
                  she had in reality been the youth which her outward show indicated her to be. She
                  was in no hurry to reach the place for which she had set out, so she sauntered
                  along Camp street at her ease, and had just passed the theatre, when she was
                  startled by a cry of 'Stop thief!' immediately behind her, and directly afterwards
                  a man, closely pursued by a number of others, rushed rapidly past her. As he did
                  so, he attempted to throw a watch which he had in his hand down a basement way,
                  but as it flew by Estelle, the guard-chain caught on a button of her coat, and the
                  watch was arrested in its flight. Trembling with fear, she hastened to free
                  herself from the dangerous piece of property, and just as she had succeeded in
                  doing so, she found herself in the grasp of a couple of stout policemen, who, in
                  spite of her protestations of innocence, dragged her along in no gentle manner,
                  and it was not long before she found herself thrust with some force into a cell,
                  the door of which was instantly closed upon her, and she was left to her own
                  reflections. The whole incident had happened so suddenly, that it seemed more like
                  a dream to the captive than anything else, and while she was yet reflecting upon
                  the unfortunate chance which had placed her in such a predicament, and regretting
                  that she had net followed Kate's advice, the door of her cell was again thrown
                  open, and a man who struggled desperately with the officers who had him in charge,
                  was thrust in along with her. His face was covered with blood which flowed from a
                  frightful gash on his forehead, and his eyes glared wildly with the frenzy of
                  drunkenness—his beard was unshorn, his hair uncombed, and his face dirty—but
                  beneath all this disguise of rum and dirt, and blood, and passion, Estelle
                  recognized by the bright light of a link held by one of the officers, the features
                  of James Ely!</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
               <p>THE first feeling which took possession of Estelle, after the surprise occasioned
                  by the sudden and unexpected appearance of her lover had passed away, was that of
                  joy—for a moment she had forgot all that had passed, and could only see in the
                  pitiable object before her the cherished idol of her youthful heart—their
                  quarrels, his departure, and her hateful marriage, were all for an instant
                  swallowed up in one uncontrollable outburst of long-subdued love, and she was a
                  child again. It was <emph>but</emph> for an instant though—for presently her heart
                  thrilled with fear as she listened to the incoherent ravings of the victim of
                  alcohol, as he beat against the cell-door with his fists, and plucked at his beard
                  and hair in his impotent rage. Trembling with apprehension, she crouched down in a
                  dark corner of the dungeon to wait till he should become more composed before she
                  approached him, for she was fearful that he might in his delirium kill her.</p>
               <p>'Who charges me with duplicity?' shrieked the madman, addressing an imaginary
                  companion, 'is it you? or you? or you? Ha! you dare not answer! And why? Because
                  you are liars! all liars! I had nothing to do with her death! How could I help her
                  going crazy? Answer that! O, you can grin, and mock me, d——n you! but that's
                  all—there, take that!' and as he spoke, he struck out violently at some imaginary
                  object, and losing his balance, fell at full length upon the dungeon floor, his
                  head coming close to where Estelle was crouching. The fall seemed to stun him, and
                  for some time he lay motionless and breathing heavily. At length he again spoke,
                  but this time his tones assumed more the plaintive voice of childhood than the
                  savage vociferations of a strong man. 'O, forgive me, Hortense,' he said,
                  appealingly. 'I cannot love you, but I will try to act a humane part by you—I
                  should do so for the sake of our little one who is even now smiling in my face as
                  though pleading for his mother. Don't let him cling so closely around my neck—he
                  suffocates me! O, God!' he screamed again suddenly, while every muscle quivered
                  with extreme agony—'Now, he is turning into a snake! His fangs are frightful! his
                  hot breath stifles me! and I feel his cold, slimy coils, fastening around my
                  throat in the work of strangulation! O, remove him! remove him for the love of
                  Heaven, or I shall die!'</p>
               <p>Estelle could not see the expression which rested upon the face of the inebriate,
                  but his voice was piteously plaintive, and by the dim light which struggled
                  through the bars of the cell she could perceive that he had fallen in a rather
                  uneasy position, and with one hand was violently pressing his own windpipe. She
                  did not think she would run much risk in attempting to render his attitude more
                  easy, so she cautiously approached him, and gently disengaging his hand, stretched
                  his arm out by his side. No reply from the afflicted man followed the act, but he
                  was evidently relieved, for, heaving a deep sigh, he stretched his contracted
                  limbs out, and after breathing heavily a few times, fell into an uneasy
                  slumber.</p>
               <p>As soon as she was satisfied he slept, Estelle removed his<pb n="240-241"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000121"/> cravat, and unbuttoned the throat-band of his
                  shirt—she then took a handkerchief from her pocket, and, as well as she was able
                  in the darkness, wiped the blood from the wound upon his forehead, after which she
                  bound his head up, and then sat down to await his waking.</p>
               <p>Painful were her reflections as she watched, in that damp and dismal place, over
                  the form of the man she so dearly loved, for the sentences which had fallen from
                  him in his delirium, at first impressed her with the idea that he must have
                  forgotten her. When this conviction forced itself upon her, she reviewed the
                  particulars of her quarrel with him and the cause which led to it—as she did so,
                  she remembered that he did not strive, when they fell out, to keep up his
                  acquaintance with the object of her jealousy, but left St. Louis at once, and as
                  this fact flashed across her mind, she hugged to her heart the idea that he must
                  have repented of the part he had played—that he had indeed loved her—that he did
                  perhaps love her still, as ardently as she did him—that he had married in anger
                  because of her coldness, and with a desire to forget her, but that he had found it
                  impossible to shut love out from his heart. When she had arrived thus far in her
                  imaginings she was filled with the most intense joy, for she looked upon him as
                  her own again, although she could not ever hope to enjoy that peace of mind which
                  'love's young dream' had brought with it. She did not regret that she had met him
                  at such a time and under such circumstances. On the contrary, she rejoiced at it,
                  for she reflected that the deeper he was sunk in sin and degradation the better he
                  was fitted for companionship with her. 'He is mine,' she muttered, 'mine, by all
                  the powers of good and evil, for our love was first sanctioned by Heaven, and the
                  devil now cements it. It is fitting I should find him thus, for his condition
                  stamps us equals still—we are altered in nothing save that vice has taken the
                  place of virtue, and virtue is but a name—a mockery—a cheat—which the more
                  fortunate of the human race adopt to deceive their fellows! If I conjecture
                  rightly, I say again, he is mine; and no power on earth shall part us!'</p>
               <p>While thus communing with herself she fell into a doze, which, broken only at
                  intervals by some frightful dream or the moaning of her fellow prisoner, lasted
                  till the gray of dawn began to struggle through the bars of the cell. She then
                  shook off her stupor and determined to make herself known to her lover before the
                  officers of the law should separate them. Accordingly, with a beating heart she
                  approached him for this purpose, and stooping over him she shook him gently and
                  called him by name. With a heavy sigh, immediately followed by a deep groan, he
                  opened his eyes and fixed them upon the companion of his captivity, the outline of
                  whose figure was only as yet visible, in the uncertain light.</p>
               <p>'Where am I?' he said, stretching out his hands and feeling of the damp dungeon
                  floor on either side of him, 'where am I, and how came I here?'</p>
               <p>'You are in prison,' answered Estelle, in as altered a voice as she could assume,
                  'and you was brought here last night by the officers of the law.'</p>
               <p>'O, then, I suppose you are here to lead me before that individual, who, under
                  cover of the law, daily makes a mockery of justice?' said Ely, enquiringly, and
                  with bitter emphasis. 'Well, I'm ready—come along!' and he made an attempt to rise
                  to his feet, but stopped half-way in a sitting posture.</p>
               <p>'You are mistaken,' answered Estelle, 'I am no officer, but a prisoner like
                  yourself.</p>
               <p>'And what is <emph>your</emph> offence?' enquired Ely, with apparent interest—'I
                  know what mine is, although I have no recollection of having been brought here. My
                  crime is drunkenness. It <emph>is</emph> a crime I admit, but there are hundreds
                  in this city—aye, and among others some who wear the ermine—who are guilty of it,
                  and yet escape unpunished.</p>
               <p>'Perhaps the very man who in a short time will, with a majestic front and a frown
                  of severe indignation at the enormity<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6405-00000122"/>
                  of my offence, pass judgment upon me, went roaring drunk to bed last night. Yet
                  there was no one to arrest him; and why? Because he had a grand house to get drunk
                  in, and servants to take his abuse and wait upon him. It is only the
                  poverty-stricken and houseless wretch who properly comes under the influence of
                  the law, which is not intended for the richly-dressed and well-fed debauchee. But
                  tell me, what is your crime? You surely cannot have been guilty of drunkenness,
                  for to judge from the sound of your voice, you are much too young to know anything
                  of the vice.'</p>
               <p>'No,' answered Estelle, 'I was brought here on suspicion of being a party to a
                  theft; but I am innocent of the charge. I knew no more of the affair which led to
                  my arrest than you do.'</p>
               <p>'Humph!' said Ely, 'have you got money—plenty of it? If you have, that story will
                  do well enough; but if you are poor, your wisest plan would be to plead guilty to
                  the charge, even if you are innocent. It will go easier with you. Take the advice
                  of one who knows. If you have influential friends and plenty of money, assert your
                  innocence even though your guilt be as clear as the sun at noon-day, for the
                  chances are in favor of your acquittal: but if you are poor, and friendless, and
                  homeless, plead guilty, even though you are innocent of, and would rather die than
                  commit the offence charged against you. This is the best advice I can give you.
                  What is your name?' he asked rather abruptly.</p>
               <p>Estelle hesitated a moment, to fix upon a name for the time being, and at length
                  answered—</p>
               <p>'My name is Henry Grant—and now I suppose I may take the same liberty which you
                  have taken, and inquire what your, name is?'</p>
               <p>Ely started at the sound of a name which was graven upon his inmost heart, never
                  to be obliterated, but which, for many long weary days of trial and suffering, he
                  had never allowed to escape his lips; and after a silence of some moments, during
                  which he seemed lost in thought, he said, apparently more to himself than to
                  Estelle—</p>
               <p>'How natural it sounds! It seems but yesteday that she who bore it was a little
                  artless girl, and myself a careless, happy boy, full of hope and promise. O,
                  Estelle!—Estelle! where are you now? O, if you could know where and what I am at
                  this moment, and could feel what has produced this change in me, it would wring
                  your heart, I know, and though you might not love, you could not choose but pity
                  me.'</p>
               <p>Joy—wild, frantic and impetuous—filled the heart of Estelle, as she listened to
                  the words which fell from the lips of her lover, and she could scarcely refrain
                  from throwing herself into his arms and declaring herself. She restrained herself,
                  however, and remarked—</p>
               <p>'You do not gratify my curiosity as I did yours. I ask you for your name, and,
                  instead of answering you go on to speak of some Estelle. Well, never mind—I will
                  not press you to reveal what you apparently wish to keep hidden. By the way,
                  though, it seems somewhat singular to me that you should couple the name of
                  Estelle with my last name. I have a cousin name Estelle Grant—perhaps you mean
                  her? She was the daughter of a merchant in St. Louis—Edward Grant.'</p>
               <p>'I did know her once,' said Ely, with much emotion; 'I was, in fact, rather
                  intimate with her—but I did not know that she had a cousin in this country.'</p>
               <p>'At that time, I presume, she had not,' answered Estelle; 'it is but about a year
                  since I arrived here from England.'</p>
               <p>'And have you seen Estelle?' asked Ely, eagerly, 'Where is she? How is she?'</p>
               <p>'She was poorly enough the last time I saw her,' answered Estelle. 'She grieves
                  after a youth named Ely, who first won her affection and then deserted her.'</p>
               <p>'How did you learn that?' asked Ely, terribly excited.</p>
               <p>'She made me her confidant,' replied Estelle, 'and told me so herself. She told me
                  that their course of love ran smoothly<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6405-00000123"/>
                  ly enough, till he learned that she was poor, when he slighted her for one who was
                  more wealthy; and, in a moment of wounded pride and anger, she retaliated, and
                  that led to their separation. She said, however, that she could never cease to
                  love him—that she should carry the recollection of his love with her always, and
                  that all which made life at all desirable to her was the hope that she should one
                  day be permitted to see him again without his being aware of her presence.'</p>
               <p>'O, she was deceived!' cried Ely, in a tone of anguish, 'cruelly deceived! I am
                  that James Ely, and I am satisfied now that we were made the victims of some
                  heartless plot contrived by the different members of her family. O, my friend, if
                  you should ever see her again, tell her from me, how deeply, how devotedly, how
                  madly I loved, and still love her, although I can never see her more. Do not let
                  her know what an outcast wretch I have become; but tell her that in all my
                  wanderings, I have carried her image in my heart of hearts, and that my last life
                  pulses will beat for her! O, how she would loathe me if she could see me in this
                  guise! But she should not, for it was distraction at her loss which caused it
                  all!'</p>
               <p>'She <emph>has</emph> seen you in that guise, and she does <emph>not</emph> loathe
                  you!' exclaimed Estelle, extatically, in her natural voice, as she threw herself
                  upon his neck—'James, James—do you not know me?'</p>
               <p>'Is this reality?' said Ely, in a bewildered manner, 'or am I deceived by some
                  unaccountable, but blissful hallucination? Speak to me again!' he continued, as he
                  gazed fixedly into her face, which, as daylight had considerably advanced, was now
                  plainly discernible. 'Speak to me again! Let me once more hear the sound of that
                  voice, and, even though you are trifling with me, I will bless you!'</p>
               <p>'It is no deception, James!' replied the excited girl, as she clung more closely
                  to him—'I am your own Estelle—yours, yours, forever!'</p>
               <p>'Who talks of misfortune, now!' cried Ely, as he warmly embraced her, 'it is not
                  in fate to wring a groan or a sigh from me again. I am happy—thrice happy! But,'
                  he continued, as he held her from him, and viewed himself with supreme disgust,
                  'are you not ashamed to take so pitiable an object as I am to your heart? Does not
                  your soul revolt at the idea of loving so disgusting an object, and a criminal,
                  too?'</p>
               <p>'No, no, James,' she answered, 'if you have transgressed so have I also—I have
                  sinned beyond salvation—there is no hope for me. Even my love for you is now
                  sinful, and, if you cannot resolve hereafter to banish every idea of virtue, and
                  to live for revenge alone, we may as well part as we have met, for you are no fit
                  companion for me! Say, can you resolve to forget the past, and to begin life with
                  me anew? Can you determine to devote all your energies to the crushing of your
                  enemies and mine? If not, farewell, after this interview, for we have talked too
                  long already!'</p>
               <p>'I am yours, Estelle!' exclaimed Ely, 'for good or evil, for virtue or vice, for
                  life or death, I am yours, and yours only! Do with me as you will.'</p>
               <p>A look of joyful satisfaction beamed in the dark eyes of Estelle, as she imprinted
                  a kiss upon the lips of Ely, and exclaimed—</p>
               <p>Then, thus I seal the bond between us! The spirits of darkness ratify it, and we
                  shall never part!'</p>
               <p>A silence of a few moments followed, when Ely inquired—</p>
               <p>'But how came you here in this disguise? What has happened since I left St. Louis?
                  Tell me all—everything—and I will be equally candid with you.'</p>
               <p>Estelle was about to reply, when footsteps were heard in the corridor, and she
                  said, hurriedly—</p>
               <p>'Wait till we can talk without restraint. The jailor comes this way, and at
                  present we must be strangers.'</p>
               <p>She had scarcely ceased speaking when an officer made his appearance, and
                  conducted them into the presence of the official<pb n="246-247"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000124"/> cial before whom they were to undergo a preliminary
                  examination. A number of prisoners, of every grade, shade and occupation, were
                  present, but Estelle and Ely had not long to wait for their turn. The former was
                  first called upon, and, as no suspicion of her sex was excited, and no one
                  appeared against her, she was, after a severe reprimand, discharged. Ely Was then
                  called forward, and, as he had made a desperate resistance when arrested for being
                  drunk and disorderly, he was fined in a small amount, which Estelle stepped
                  forward and paid, and they left the court together, Estelle leading the way to her
                  rooms in Camp Street.</p>
               <p>They arrived there without accident, and found Kate O' Donnell crazy with
                  grief—walking up and down the room hurriedly, and frantically wringing her
                  hands.</p>
               <p>'O, misthress, dear!' she said, when Estelle entered, 'where have ye bin at all!'
                  Then, suddenly checking herself, she glanced at Ely, and whispered in Estelle's
                  ear, 'an' where did ye pick up the loafer?'</p>
               <p>'Silence!' cried Estelle, angrily, and then, looking significantly at Kate, she
                  continued: 'You must show this gentleman every respect, Kate. He is not what he
                  seems—he is my husband—do you understand?'</p>
               <p>'Conshumin' to me iv I do,' answered Kate, with a puzzled air—'did he git married
                  since ye went away?'</p>
               <p>'If you wish to remain friends with me,' answered Estelle, smiling in spite of
                  herself at the comical expression on Kate's countenance, 'you will ask no
                  questions, but do as I bid you—some other time I will make everything plain to
                  you, but at present you must smother your astonishment as you best may. You may go
                  to your room now, and when I want you I will call you.'</p>
               <p>Kate departed as ordered, but, as she walked through the entry, she muttered—</p>
               <p>'It's the purty <emph>gintleman,</emph> he is, anyways. Sure I wouldn't brush me
                  dhirty shoes upon the likes iv him, besides takin him for a husband—an' it bothers
                  me intirely to think wot the mistress can be about. Sure it's crazy she is, I
                  believe—an' its mesilf that 'll be after watching the blaguard!'</p>
               <p>As soon as Kate was gone and they were once more alone, Estelle redeemed the
                  promise which she had made Ely in the dungeon. She went over every incident of her
                  life from the time that she had last seen him till she met him again, in the
                  manner which has just been described. As her narrative progressed, Ely plainly saw
                  the game which had been played upon them, and a look of deep malignity clouded his
                  brow, as Estelle related the particulars concerning the conversation which she had
                  held with her sister while walking in the garden, and which had been the principal
                  cause of his leaving home. He was also terribly enraged at the recital of
                  Hollowell's marriage and the tragical death of old Mrs. Dunscomb. When Estelle had
                  finished, she called upon her lover for a narrative of his wanderings, and after
                  reflecting a moment, he said—</p>
               <p>'In some particulars my history since we parted is not unlike your own. On leaving
                  St. Louis, slighted love, (or what I deemed such,) wounded pride, and bitter
                  disappointment, were raging in my heart, and a feeling of utter recklessness took
                  possession of me. It mattered little to me in which direction I turned my face, so
                  that I placed a long distance between you and myself. So I took passage on board a
                  New Orleans boat, and on the first night of my journey, for the first time in my
                  life, I was in a beastly state of intoxication. I flew to brandy to drown
                  recollection, and while what little money I had lasted, I do not think I once drew
                  a sober breath. At length, however, my means were exhausted, and I found it
                  necessary to seek after some means of gaining a livelihood. While wandering
                  dispiritedly around the streets of New Orleans one day I entered the shipping
                  office of Camp &amp; Co. (the individual whom you mentioned in your narrative as
                  having so justly swindled) and made application for a berth of<pb n="248-249"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000125"/> some kind on ship-board. I went through a
                  preliminary course of some weeks in the office, when finally I was placed in the
                  capacity of clerk on board a merchantman bound to Barbadoes. She was rather an
                  unseaworthy vessel, and we had been but a few days out when we experienced a
                  series of very severe gales, which strained the old hulk terribly, and finally she
                  went down near Cape Sable on the Florida Coast, with every soul on board except
                  myself and the first mate. It is strange how strong the law of self-preservation
                  is in human nature. Now, I had wished myself dead a thousand times, and had it not
                  been for a lingering hope that I should one day see you again (a hope which,
                  singular as it may appear, has never for a moment entirely forsaken me) I do
                  believe I should have ended my existence by suicide. But when I found the ship
                  going down and saw death staring me in the face, no mortal ever struggled harder
                  for life than I did. When I arose to the surface after the sinking of the ship, I
                  saw many of the crew struggling for life, and, notwithstanding my own danger, my
                  blood curdled with horror as the despairing cry of 'some strong swimmer in his
                  agony' rang in my ears, but I could lend no one assistance as you may well
                  believe. I struck out vigorously for a chicken-coop which I saw floating near me,
                  and was fortunate enough to obtain a secure hold of it. A number of others were
                  not so fortunate. Some three or four grasped at it, but they either missed it or
                  relin-guished their old after hanging on for a few moments, and in an hour after
                  the sinking of the ship, not a sign of her nor a human being was visible. I
                  thought at the time that every human soul on board had perished, but I learned
                  afterwards that the first mate was saved, as I have already stated. Not to be
                  tedious, I floated around till well-nigh exhausted, when I was eventually picked
                  up by a trading vessel bound from New York to Vera Cruz, and carried to the latter
                  port. I staid in Vera Cruz for some weeks, and then made my way to Jalappa, in
                  Mexico. Here I obtained a situation as clerk in a mercantile establishment, and
                  shortly afterwards made the acquaintance of Hortense Dupont, a French girl whose
                  parents had settled in Jalappa some years previously. My meeting with her was the
                  most unfortunate event of my life. life. She was beautiful, witty, and apparently
                  virtuous and affectionate, and her father who was quite well off, seemed to take a
                  great fancy to me, and encourage my visits. To be brief, I married her. I need not
                  tell you what a struggle that act caused me, for you yourself have suffered in the
                  same way, and know how to pity me. I did not love her, and I married more for the
                  purpose of trying to forget you than any thing else.</p>
               <p>'Things went well enough till some time after a son was born to me, and then an
                  event happened which changed me from a man into a devil. I had long suspected my
                  wife of being too intimate with a fellow clerk of mine who professed for me the
                  greatest friendship, and who was in the habit of visiting us frequently. I did not
                  give expression to my suspicions, but kept a close watch upon their movements, and
                  at length I detected them in their sin. I rushed at my hypocritical friend with
                  all the ferocity of a tiger, and after a severe struggle, during which my guilty
                  wife made her escape, and sought the protection of her father, I killed him upon
                  the spot by driving a clasp-knife up to the hilt in his heart. I was tried for the
                  homicide, and acquitted. I then obtained possession of my child, and set myself to
                  study how I might revenge myself upon its mother. The deep injury which she had
                  done me rankled in my heart, and rendered me perfectly furious. At first I thought
                  of watching an opportunity, and killing her as I did her paramour. It would have
                  been more merciful had I done so, but I gave up the idea because I did not feel
                  willing to place my life in jeopardy for the sake of taking hers. It was a severe
                  blow to her when I deprived her of the child, for although corrupt at heart there
                  can be no question that she loved it. But I was not satisfied with this. I
                  followed her up wherever she went, and kept continually<pb n="250-251"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000126"/> taunting her with her infidelity. Even into the
                  church I followed her, and proclaimed her shame aloud. I gave her no respite—no
                  rest—and at length she attempted to run away from me. She took passage for New
                  Orleans, but I was informed of the movement by her servant girl, who was in my
                  pay, and secured a passage for myself and the nurse with whom I had placed my
                  babe, on board the same ship. I did not let her see me till the vessel was out at
                  sea, and then I discovered myself to her at the dinner-table, and published her
                  shame aloud to the assembled passengers. She fell upon her knees before me and
                  begged me for the love of Heaven to pity and kill her—but I only laughed at her
                  and spurned her away from me. That night she jumped overboard, and then my
                  insatiable thirst for blood was satisfied, and again I resorted to strong drink to
                  drown reflection. It was only two days after my wife committed suicide that the
                  vessel shipped a heavy sea, and my child's nurse, who was on deck at the time, was
                  washed overboard and lost. The infant was not with her—that was lying asleep in
                  her berth. I arrived in Hew Orleans about a month ago, and placed my infant under
                  the care of a black woman in Carondelet street. I gave her a sufficient sum for
                  its support for six months to come, and I have not seen her or the child since,
                  for I have been drank constantly, and have sought my companions amongst the lowest
                  of the low. While crazy with liquor last night I was arrested, and you know the
                  rest.'</p>
               <p>'And now,' said Estelle, when Ely had got through with his narrative, 'we are one
                  and inseparable. You have been deeply injured, and so have I. You have been partly
                  revenged, and so have I. We have each imbued our hands in human blood, and having
                  once commenced let us not stop short of revenge full, complete, and direful. Our
                  enemies have made us what we are, and now let them—or all of them who still
                  survive——have cause to tremble at their own creation!'</p>
               <p>'I am with you!' exclaimed Ely.</p>
               <p>'Enough!' returned Estelle, 'and now the scene of our future operations should be
                  New York—so let us remove there at once. I have sufficient money to last us for
                  some time to come. To-morrow you must provide yourself with suitable clothing for
                  the voyage, obtain your child—of whom Kate shall take charge, and the next day we
                  will engage passage. As we are to travel as man and wife perhaps it would be well
                  for you to take my assumed name. Let us travel as Mr. and Mrs. Graham, child and
                  servant. Does that suit you?'</p>
               <p>'Excellently well,' was the reply, and the plan thus fixed upon was carried out to
                  the letter, for two weeks afterwards the vicious and depraved pair were located on
                  the upper part of New York city, on the west side.</p>

               <p>VIRTUOUS love is a great mental alterative—a most efficacious purifier of the
                  heart. After a young man has for years led an aimless, profitless, devil-may-care
                  life—after he has proved the deceit of the world—the folly that brings with it
                  repentance, and the delusive pleasure that is sure to cloy—after he has, in fact,
                  as the saying goes, 'seen the folly of his ways,' the undivided attachment of a
                  pure young heart exercises an influence over him which is unbounded in its power
                  for good, and which he cannot fully comprehend, until it forces him to turn his
                  eyes inward upon himself and to witness, in all its glaring deformity, the
                  contrast between his own heart and the heart which he<pb n="252-253"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000127"/> would make its idol. He then beholds how much more
                  beautiful is virtue than vice, and perceiving, at the same time, the impossibility
                  of their amalgamation, he exerts himself to prune his nature of its grossness, so
                  that the soul beloved may find its counterpart.</p>
               <p>This was the case with Robert Barker after his first introduction to Helen
                  Wallace. The love-inspiring glances that darted from her soul-lit eyes of blue,
                  found their way into his heart, and commenced a work of reformation there, which
                  increased with each succeeding day, till his utter disgust for himself which first
                  followed conviction, at last passed away, and peace, tranquil and consolatory,
                  stole into his bosom. It was not without severe trial and tribulation, however,
                  that he reached this point, for black malice was at work against him. The
                  envenomed tongue of slander assailed him—detraction was busy with his fair fame,
                  and the voice of the syren whispered in his ear to lure him back to sin. He had a
                  vindictive and determined enemy in Everard Emory, who, having been unmasked by him
                  and driven in disgrace from his church, had sworn to be revenged, and unceasingly
                  did he follow up his victim—but all without effect, for Barker thwarted his
                  machinations at every turn, and eventually came out of the contest all the purer
                  for being so sorely tried.</p>
               <p>And there was one fair member of the church to which he belonged who closely
                  watched (although he knew it not) these struggles of the young convert—one whose
                  eyes sparkled with pleasure, and whose heart pulsated with joy, when he arose
                  among his associates at each new charge brought against him, and conscious of his
                  innocence, with unblenching brow and earnest voice, sifted the testimony, and made
                  plain the malice which lay at the bottom of it. This fair observer was Mary
                  Gardner. Unknown to Barker she had an understanding with her cousin Helen Wallace,
                  with whom she corresponded regularly, and whose happiness was as near her heart as
                  was her own, to watch closely and fairly to report the youth's conduct. Love, like
                  murder, will out, and Mary knew that Helen had some regard for Barker, and this it
                  was that so delighted her when she saw the latter triumph over his enemies.</p>
               <p>About six months had passed away after Robert Barker's first introduction to Helen
                  Wallace, when, as he sat in his study one day after dinner, a ring at the
                  hall-door bell was heard, and shortly afterwards the servant announced that a
                  gentleman calling himself Mr. Ainslie, wished to see him.</p>
               <p>'What! my old friend, Jack Ainslie!' exclaimed Barker, in some surprise, 'I wonder
                  what he can want? Show him up, Thomas—I am not particularly busy, and I'd as soon
                  see him here as down stairs.'</p>
               <p>The servant departed, and the next moment the good-na-tured face of Jack was
                  visible at the door of the study.</p>
               <p>'Well, Jack, how do you do?' inquired Barker, at the same time shaking the
                  extended hand of the policeman cordially—'it is some time since I saw you last,
                  but you look as hearty as ever'—then slightly altering his tone, he continued in a
                  playful manner, 'I hope you haven't got a warrant for me, have you?'</p>
               <p>'Well, no,' muttered Jack, as he threw himself into a chair which Barker
                  proffered, 'I ain't on business just now—that is, my legitimate business, I
                  mean—that is, I don't know but what it may be called legitimate business, too—that
                  is, I—you——' and Jack balanced his hat by the rim, drew a long breath, and was
                  silent.</p>
               <p>'Why, what on earth is the matter with the fellow!' cried Barker, laughing—'out
                  with it, Jack, can't you? Don't be afraid—I won't arrest you, although I must say
                  you look as though you had been committing some crime.'</p>
               <p>'The fact is,' said Jack, at last, getting rid of the words as fast as possible,
                  as though fearful if he paused to put in a comma he might break down again, 'that
                  I'm going to be married, and I want you to lend me a little assistance.'</p>
               <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6405-00000128"/>
               <p>'Is that all?' inquired Barker, in a merry tone—'well, I don't see why you should
                  hesitate so much about telling that—for my part (and here a heavy sigh escaped
                  him) I wish I could say the same thing with truth, and I wouldn't be long about
                  it. It would be the most joyful truth I ever uttered!'</p>
               <p>'O, yes,' replied Jack Ainslie, 'that's all well enough—it ain't a very hard thing
                  to be brave when there's no danger—but I tell you, when marryin' comes to the
                  pinch it's a mighty ticklish thing, and if you ever have to go through with it,
                  you'll find it so. I've been teazing and coaxing my Moll to fix the day for the
                  last six months, and now that I've got her to do so at last, I feel myself growing
                  more and more trembly every day that brings the affair nearer.'</p>
               <p>'I guess you'll manage to survive the blow,' said Barker, again resuming his
                  cheerful tone, 'but you said something about assistance. How can I assist you? Do
                  you want a check? and if so, for what amount? You can have it.'</p>
               <p>'O, no, Lord bless you,' said Jack, smiling, 'I don't want any sich assistance as
                  that! Thank fortune, I'm all right in the matter of dollars and cents, and if I
                  wasn't I shouldn't have to apply to you for a check, for poverty of itself would
                  be check enough to all matrimonial arrangements—I don't believe in marryin' with
                  an empty pocket.'</p>
               <p>'Well, then, what is it, Jack?' questioned Barker, 'don't be afraid to ask
                  anything of me which it is in my power to grant. You have acted the part of a
                  friend to me more than once in helping me to expose the schemes of my old
                  associates to ruin me, and I am not ungrateful. Had it not been for your untiring
                  efforts in searching out the real offender, I should more than likely have been
                  indicted for arson.</p>
               <p>'Very likely—very likely,' replied Jack, thoughtfully—then after musing a moment
                  he continued, 'that Emory is a keen one, and no mistake! What a pity it is we
                  could not have traced the plot home to him!'</p>
               <p>'Never mind, Jack,' said Barker, 'don't let us talk about him now—his 'sins will
                  find him out' some day or other—of that rest assured. And now what of this
                  assistance? Come to the point at once!'</p>
               <p>'Well, there was a time,' replied Jack with diffidence, 'when I wouldn't have come
                  to you for sich a thing—there was a time when you held your head pretty high, and
                  would have rolled your eyes around in astonishment if I had asked sich a favor of
                  you as I'm going to ask now—that was when you was a make b'lieve gentleman, of no
                  use to yourself or anybody else—but now that you are a real gentleman and of some
                  account in the world, I ain't afraid to ask a favor of you. The fact is, I want
                  you to 'stand up' with me—to act as my groomsman.'</p>
               <p>'Is that all?' exclaimed Barker, joyfully, 'to be sure I will, Jack, and thank you
                  too. Why, I'm in luck! It is only three days since, that I received an invitation
                  to be present at the marriage of Minnie Jay, who is to become Mrs. Richard
                  Hamilton this very night, and now here I have an invitation to act as groomsman!
                  When does your interesting affair come off?'</p>
               <p>'Well, you see,' answered Jack, 'I'm almost ashamed to tell you, for it's rather a
                  short notice to give you, but the fact is girls will be girls, and that's the only
                  excuse I can make. The whole long and short of the matter is this. Yesterday my
                  Moll called upon Minnie to see how she was getting on, and as a matter of course
                  all their conversation was about the two fast approaching events. In the course of
                  their conversation, Minnie happened to remark what a glorious thing a double
                  wedding would be—it would be so interesting! and they would have so much more
                  confidence to go through with it! and it would save so much trouble both to be
                  married at the same time! And so, to be short about it, the double wedding takes
                  place to-night at the house of Minnie Jay.'</p>
               <p>'Excellent!' exclaimed Barker, delightedly, 'excellent! I think the ladies are
                  quite right!' Then, as a look of anxiety settled upon his features, he enquired
                  tremulously, 'what young ladies are to act as your bride's friends on the
                  occasion?'</p>
               <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6405-00000129"/>
               <p>'There it is again, you see,' replied Jack, and a mischievous look sparkled in his
                  merry eye as he spoke, 'the thing was so sudden that we hadn't time to complete
                  all our arrangements. Moll did intend that her cousin Helen should be one of her
                  bridesmaids, but it would be impossible for her to get here in time now, and the
                  wedding must come off anyhow—there's no help for it.'</p>
               <p>Robert Barker sighed heavily, but he soon shook off the gloom which oppressed him,
                  and replied gaily—</p>
               <p>'Well, Jack, I am free to confess I should have liked it better had you told me
                  that Miss Wallace was to be of the party, but under any circumstances I shall be
                  only too happy to witness your union with I honestly believe one of the best young
                  ladies in the whole world—so you may expect me to-night without fail. At what hour
                  does the ceremony take place?'</p>
               <p>'At 9 o'clock,' answered Jack.</p>
               <p>'Then I shall be there at about 8,' said Barker.</p>
               <p>'Yes, that will be about the right hour,' returned Jack Ainslie, as he put on his
                  hat, preparatory to his departure. 'Good day, Mr. Barker; I know you will be
                  delighted with the ceremony; it will be the happiest wedding that ever you
                  attended, I promise you. Good bye.'</p>
               <p>'Good bye,' answered Barker, and Jack departed.</p>
               <p>When he was gone, Barker dropped into a chair, and after a few moments'
                  reflection, he muttered mournfully to himself—</p>
               <p>'It would gratify me to gaze upon her angelic face once again, and to listen to
                  the rich music of her heart-thrilling tones! Helen—<emph>dear</emph> Helen! O,
                  'tis sweet to think of thee, and to pronounce thy dear name, even though we are
                  divided by distance, and may never meet again! It is sweet to reflect that even
                  though you blame, you do not utterly condemn me; and O, how gratifying to my heart
                  is the thought that, although I may never call thee mine, I may, at least, become
                  more worthy of thy love—taught by the language of thy virtue-inspiring spiring
                  eyes to exchange the dross of vice for the pure gold of virtue!'</p>
               <p>The day passed wearily with him; for he could not shake off the loneliness which
                  oppressed him at the thought that he was to take part in a marriage ceremony,
                  without the idol of his heart being present, in the room where he had first beheld
                  her.</p>
               <p>As the hour of 8 approached, he took his way to Minnie Jay's residence; and when
                  he arrived there, an interesting and joyous scene presented itself. A party of
                  young ladies and gentlemen had assembled, and were gathered in small groups around
                  the different candidates for matrimonial felicity, and ever and anon, as some
                  witty allusion or facetious remark (which, under less exciting circumstances,
                  would perhaps have passed without notice) dropped from one of them, a peal of
                  uproarious mirth would break forth. Barker tried to enter fairly into the spirit
                  of the thing, and though actually sad at heart, he so far succeeded in conquering
                  his feelings as to avoid imparting any degree of his own gloom to the happy party.
                  The hour of 9 approached, and everybody save the minister and one of Mary
                  Gardener's bridesmaids was present. Their backwardness was just about being made
                  the theme of general comment, when, as the clock upon the mantel-piece struck the
                  hour appointed, a carriage rolled up to the door, and the minister's arrival was
                  announced. The only person whose presence the company now lacked, was the
                  bridesmaid before alluded to. She was to be Barker's partner on the occasion, and
                  Mary Gardener had told him that she was finishing her toilet in another part of
                  the house, and would soon make her appearance; and scarcely had she imparted this
                  piece of information, when the door opened, and Helen Wallace, radiant with
                  beauty, entered the room. O, how wildly the heart of Barker throbbed! how swiftly
                  the blood coursed along his veins! and how violently his hand trembled, as she<pb
                     n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6405-00000130"/> approached him, with pleasure beaming
                  in her eyes, and gracefully placed her slender, delicate fingers within his!</p>
               <p>'It is long since we last met, Mr. Barker,' she said, in her soft, flute-like
                  voice, 'and our acquaintance could not possibly have been renewed upon a more
                  happy occasion than this.'</p>
               <p>'The time has indeed seemed long to me since I saw you last,' answered Barker, in
                  an under tone, 'and it only needed your presence to render this scene the happiest
                  one to me in which I have ever participated. Your appearance here fills me with a
                  joy which is more complete because it was entirely unlooked-for.'</p>
               <p>Helen blushed deeply as she replied, in a playful tone—</p>
               <p>'It was my fault that you were kept in ignorance of my intention to be present. I
                  so ordered it. You will remember that I told you I might come upon you when you
                  least expected it; and you will forgive me, I am sure.'</p>
               <p>'O, you have rendered me too happy!' exclaimed Barker, whose joy, so perfect and
                  so unexpected, almost overpowered him.</p>
               <p>Just then Jack Ainslie approached them, and mischievously glancing from one to the
                  other, he whispered in the ear of Barker—</p>
               <p>'Didn't I tell you this would be a happy wedding, eh?'</p>
               <p>'Yes, but you deceived me, notwithstanding,' replied Barker, smiling.</p>
               <p>'Very true,' returned Jack Ainslie, 'but I didn't go away from the truth to do it.
                  I told you it would be impossible to get Helen here at such short notice; and so
                  it would have been; but, fortunately, it happened that she was here already.'</p>
               <p>This conversation was cut short by the minister, who, rising from his seat,
                  reminded the parties that the hour fixed upon for the ceremony to be performed bad
                  passed by, and that his time was somewhat limited.</p>
               <p>The hint was sufficient, and immediately the members of the bridal group took
                  their positions upon the floor, and the impressive pressive service was at once
                  gone through with in a solemn and dignified manner. The concluding prayer and
                  benediction having been pronounced, the ceremony of kissing the bride commenced,
                  and then great was the hilarity and mirth that for a time prevailed. Such
                  scuffling, and chasing about, and kissing the lady guests instead of the bride
                  (all in mistake, <emph>of course</emph>) was never seen before, while Jack Ainslie
                  was so much at his ease, and so glad that the difficulty was over, that he kissed
                  everybody in the room, including the men, executed a perfectly original polka, and
                  would have ended by standing upon his head in one corner of the room, had he not
                  been called to order by Richard Hamilton, the other bridegroom, who took
                  exceptions to his monopolizing all the fun, and insisted upon getting up a country
                  dance in which all might join.</p>
               <p>There were two persons in the room who did not seem disposed to take a part in the
                  wild merriment which for a time reigned supreme. These were Helen Wallace and
                  Robert Barker. As soon as the marriage ceremony was over, they seated themselves
                  in an out-of-the-way corner, and were soon engaged in a very interesting
                  conversation.</p>
               <p>'May I now hope, Miss Wallace,' said Barker, with earnestness, 'to find some
                  slight favor in your eyes? May I venture to trust that we shall meet again before
                  so extended a period as six months shall have dragged its slow length along?'</p>
               <p>Helen was silent for some moments, but at length she answered—</p>
               <p>'I am satisfied that you are not what you was—that you have striven hard, against
                  fearful odds, for the purification of the spirit, and that you have for the time
                  being triumphed, but, 'the heart of man is deceitful and desperately wicked,' and
                  the tempter may again find you. I will not deny that your noble efforts to throw
                  off the yoke of Satan have awakened my admiration and esteem, but I must have
                  assurance that this hopeful disposition will remain permanent and<pb n="260-261"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000131"/> unshaken always before I can consent to give you my
                  undivided friendship.'</p>
               <p>'And may I not hope,' asked Barker, with deep fervor, 'when my probation,
                  according to your view, shall have ended, for something <emph>more</emph> than
                  friendship? May I not then mention <emph>love?</emph> O, forgive my apparent
                  boldness, Miss Wallace, but my full heart must unburden itself even at the risk of
                  your displeasure. I have wished for, prayed for this meeting, Heaven only knows
                  how ardently. If you did but know how I have endeavored by a life of penitence to
                  cancel the errors of the past—how I have struggled for a position in the moral
                  world from which I might address you without shame—you would pity me! From the
                  first moment that I beheld you, I have not indulged in a thought which was not in
                  some way connected with you, and if you doom me now to blank despair, how can I
                  hope for strength to struggle again? Say, may I not eventually claim this hand as
                  the reward of my heart struggles?'</p>
               <p>'Force me not into making a direct answer now,' replied Helen, with emotion, at
                  the same time disengaging her hand, which Barker had taken in his; 'at some future
                  time we shall meet again, and then perhaps I may say what I dare not trust my lips
                  to utter.'</p>
               <p>Their conversation was here interrupted by Minnie, who came to call them to
                  supper, and Barker did not again during the evening gain an opportunity to address
                  her on the subject so near his heart. He had no cause to despond, however, for he
                  was not slow to discover that he had made an impression upon Helen's heart, and
                  this filled his bosom with hope.</p>
               <p>At length the supper was over—the guests one by one began to depart—and at about
                  12 o'clock Robert Barker left, and took his way homeward a happier man than he had
                  ever been before in his life. He forgot the past, and the future lay bright before
                  him. Already in imagination he stood at the altar with Helen Wallace for a bride,
                  and his heart was gay, and his footstep light, as he hurriedly walked along
                  through the deserted streets. It was a dark night—not a star was visible in the
                  firmament, and before he had walked half the distance homeward, a fine, drizzling
                  rain began to descend, but he heeded it not—he felt it not—right onward he went,
                  humming, in the exuberance of his spirits, a merry tune, and never dreaming of
                  discomfort or danger. His course lay through Hudson street, and he had well-nigh
                  reached home, when, just as he was passing underneath an awning, a man suddenly
                  sprang upon him from the deep porch of a store door, and with one well-directed
                  blow upon the back of the bead with a slung-shot, stretched him at full length
                  upon the sidewalk, and fled, leaving him senseless and weltering in his blood.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
               <p>ESTELLE'S first desire upon reaching New York again, was to regain possession of
                  her infant, and then to learn something of her relatives. The first was easy
                  enough of accomplishment, for her hand-writing and a knowledge of all the
                  circumstances under which Mrs. Gardener received the child, would, she was
                  confident, convince that lady of her rightful claim to it. With regard to her
                  relatives, however, she did not know exactly how to proceed; but she resolved to
                  secure the child first, and trust to luck for the rest. Accordingly, on the third
                  day after her arrival, she dressed herself in deep mourning, taking care to alter
                  her appearance as much as possible, and then at about 10 o'clock in the forenoon
                  she procured a carriage<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6405-00000132"/> riage, and
                  directing the hackman where to drive, she took her seat, and in a short time found
                  herself at the door of Mrs. Gardener's residence. The old lady received her very
                  kindly, and having ascertained her business, she at first fully satisfied herself
                  that Estelle was the person she represented herself to be, and then informed her
                  where the child was, and promised to send for it at once. Mrs. Gardener was not
                  naturally an inquisitive woman, but she did have a great desire to ascertain
                  something of the little stranger's history. She saw, however, that Estelle was not
                  at all inclined to converse upon the subject, so she checked her curiosity, and a
                  few days afterwards she parted with the child (having received it from her sister,
                  to whom she had written immediately) with no further knowledge of its history than
                  when she first received it.</p>
               <p>In the meantime James Ely and Kate O'Donnell (who had by the way come to be
                  excellent friends) were not idle in endeavoring to procure the information
                  concerning Estelle's relatives, which she was so anxious to gain. Sometimes they
                  went together, Kate always assuming the male attire, which she had learned to wear
                  with as much ease as though she had been bred to it; and sometimes they took
                  different directions, frequenting every place of popular resort in the city. Kate
                  would have had no difficulty in finding out the whereabouts of Emory, for she knew
                  he was to be seen almost any day in Wall street, but she did not know how to
                  approach him safely, and she preferred getting hold of his man Cantwell. This she
                  found impossible, however, for although she was untiring in her vigilance, she
                  could never manage to catch sight of him.</p>
               <p>One night about two weeks after his arrival in New York, James Ely dropped in at a
                  well-known gambling crib, which at that time was kept in Ann street, and which he
                  was in the habit of visiting occasionally, and after looking around the room a
                  while, began betting lightly on a game of faro. He had made but a few bets when
                  suddenly he was started by the sound of a voice which he thought was familiar to
                  him and looking up he was not more surprised than rejoiced to recognise in a new
                  applicant for favors from the blind goddess no less an individual than Mr.
                  Cornelius Hollowell. He was very well disguised, and Ely would not have recognised
                  him had he not at first caught the sound of his voice. He had divested himself of
                  both beard and moustaches, and wore a wig of rich flowing curls, which hung in
                  luxuriant clusters around his neck, giving him a very youthful and somewhat
                  verdant appearance, and he strove hard to create the impression that he was rather
                     <emph>green</emph> than otherwise.</p>
               <p>'I don't believe I'd ever win anything at this game,' he said; 'not if I was to
                  play at it till I was grey-headed. There it goes again,' he continued, as the
                  banker swept his checks from the board. 'I haven't won a bet to-night and I don't
                  expect to at faro. I wish somebody 'd open a little game of bluff—I don't know
                  much about playing, but I'd like to have a little amusement before I go home.
                  Who'll take a hand?' and he looked around at the assembled gamesters.</p>
               <p>Ely was but a mere boy when Hollowell had last seen him, and more than two years
                  of dissipation and hardship had wrought a great change in his appearance. He felt
                  pretty well satisfied that he would escape recognition, and he determined at all
                  events to try it, so he exclaimed, in a careless off-hand manner—</p>
               <p>'I don't care if I take a chance in for a little while—I'll make one.'</p>
               <p>'Who else 'll go in?' asked Hollowell, winking at the same time at a
                  sinister-looking individual on the other side of the table, and following up the
                  wink by asking, 'will you take a hand, sir?'</p>
               <p>'Well, I don't care if I do,' was the reply; 'I've got about ten or fifteen that
                  I'd as leave lose as not.'</p>
               <p>'That's three of us,' exclaimed Hollowell, 'now who'll make the fourth one?'</p>
               <p>'Well,' answered a coarse-featured, red-haired man, 'I'll<pb n="264-265"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000133"/> take a hand just to make up the party. I don't want
                  to play but I hate to see a three-handed game of bluff, 'cos that ain't no game at
                  all, that ain't.'</p>
               <p>'Well, then, the party's made up,' said Hollowell, 'so come along—fetch on the
                  cards!' and as the man of the sinister countenance passed Hollowell to take his
                  seat at the table, the latter whispered in his ear the mysterious sentence—</p>
               <p>'Open and shut, and an equal dividend, eh?'</p>
               <p>'Yes, that's the tanzy!' was the equally mysterious rejoinder, and shortly
                  afterwards the players were seated, the cards were dealt, and the game
                  commenced.</p>
               <p>Ely noticed the mysterious whispering between Hollowell and the man whom he had
                  invited to join in the game, and he knew that they were in league together, but
                  this made not the slightest difference to him, for however much money might pass
                  from his pocket into that of Hollowell, he determined that it should find its way
                  back again, and he had another object besides dollars and cents in joining the
                  game. So he wagered his money quite recklessly, as did also the man with the
                  sinister countenance, and all the cash on the table seemed to flow in one steady
                  stream into Hollowell's pile—the red-haired man only occasionally winning a 'pot,'
                  at every repetition of which piece of good fortune, instead of thanking his lucky
                  stars, he would swear terribly, and call down upon himself all sorts of horrid
                  maledictions.</p>
               <p>After the game had progressed about half-an-hour, Ely stopped suddenly and quietly
                  enquired—</p>
               <p>'How do you play in this house? Can an individual bluff as high as he likes, or do
                  you give a man a 'sight,' for his money?'</p>
               <p>'Why,' replied Hollowell, blandly, 'if a man hasn't money enough to call a bet he
                  must lose—that's the game of bluff—at least that's the game I play—as a matter of
                  courtsey, it's well enough to give a friend a 'sight' sometimes, but not as a
                  general thing. I don't pretend to say that I'm correct, however ever,' he added
                  innocently, 'for I don't know anything about the game more than what I've picked
                  up from playing occasionally.'</p>
               <p>'Well, I merely wanted to know,' said Ely, carelessly, and the game proceeded.</p>
               <p>A few more hands were played, when significant glances passed between Hollowell
                  and the man of the sinister countenance. Hollowell had the deal, and when Ely
                  raised his cards, he found that he held a tremendous hand, but he was satisfied at
                  the same time that the dealer held a better one. He now concluded that the proper
                  time had arrived for him to carry out the plan which he had formed on taking his
                  seat at the table, which was to get Hollowell to accompany him outside on some
                  pretence or other, so assuming an anxious air he laid his cards upon the table,
                  face down, and bringing forth his wallet, he examined his contents, after which he
                  said in a nervous manner—</p>
               <p>'Now I have a hand which I would be willing to bet considerable money on, but
                  unfortunately I have very little by me. I do not live far from here, however, and
                  if you will allow me to play my hand for what it is worth, you can accompany me
                  home if I lose, and I will give you a check for the amount.'</p>
               <p>'Well, I always like to play a liberal game,' replied Hollowell, whose greedy eyes
                  lighted up in anticipation of fingering a large pile (for he had stocked the cards
                  and knew that he had the best hand) 'and I won't take advantage of you because you
                  don't happen to have your money with you. So go ahead—you can bet as high as you
                  like, and to give you a chance, I will go fifty dollars over your last bet.'</p>
               <p>The other two players had retired from the contest, which was left between
                  Hollowell and Ely, and at each other they went furiously. The bets had increased
                  to about a thousand dollars, when eventually Ely 'called' his opponent, who<pb
                     n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6405-00000134"/> showed up four aces against four kings,
                  as Ely had expected, and won.</p>
               <p>'It is the fortune of war,' remarked Ely, affecting a heavy sigh, 'and can't be
                  helped, so, if you will now go with me to my residence, I will settle with you, at
                  once.'</p>
               <p>'I Very good,' cried Hollowell, starting up instantly, 'I am with you.'</p>
               <p>They sallied forth, and as they walked along, Hollowell, elated with the success
                  of the villainous game which he had been playing, was very loquacious, and tried
                  to make himself as agreeable as possible.</p>
               <p>'I think I've seen you before, somewhere,' he said to Ely; 'your face looks
                  somewhat, familiar to me.'</p>
               <p>'Very likely,' was the quiet reply, 'for I've travelled around considerable in my
                  time, and I'm pretty certain that I've seen you somewhere.'</p>
               <p>'It would be very strange if you hadn't,' said Hollowell, jocularty, 'everybody
                  has seen me—I can't walk through the the streets without seeing somebody I know at
                  every step; we political characters are so prominent!'</p>
               <p>'Oh, then you are a politician,' observed Ely smiling at the cool inpudence of the
                  sharper.</p>
               <p>'I should think I was,' replied Hollowell,' been twice in the Legislature and
                  should have been sent to Congress, but for the perfidy of some of my pretended
                  friends—fetch it next time, though, <emph>sure!</emph> Ah, Colonel!' he exclaimed,
                  nodding at the same time familiarly to an elderly, grave looking gentleman, who
                  happened to pass, but who did not pay the slightest attention to the
                  salutation—'that's Colonel Gruffy,' he continued—'the Colonel's an immense man,
                  and if he'd have taken my advice at the last election he would not only have been
                  in nomination for Governor of this State, but would have been elected, too; yes,
                     <emph>sir!</emph> If he had listened to me, he would now have occupied the
                  Gubernatorial chair. However, he'll know better next time.'</p>
               <p>And thus he went on, bowing as he passed along to about every second person be
                  met, and they were all Generals, Colonels, Captains, Lieutenants, Govenors or
                  Senators. They were all, he said, extremely popular with the people, but, however,
                  that may have been, it is very certain that he was not very popular with them, for
                  they each and every one of them frowned angrily upon him, and evidently regarded
                  his conduct as highly impertinent.</p>
               <p>They reached the house at last, and as Ely had a latch-key, he did not stop to
                  ring, but entered at once, and led the way into the parlor.</p>
               <p>'Please be seated,' he said, 'and wait for a moment—my wife has the key of my
                  desk, and I will return directly.'</p>
               <p>He left the room, and when Hollowell found himself alone, he began to scrutinize
                  the apartment.</p>
               <p>'Very nice, very tasty, decidedly handsome,' he soliloquised—'only another
                  evidence of the fact that appearances are deceitful. Now, I didn't dream that I
                  was going to make so much out of that fellow; he don't look such an easy bird to
                  pluck; but he is though, and there's no knowing to what amount he will be willing
                  to suffer before I've done with him. Very likely I may succeed in persuading him
                  to part with this elegant establishment. Who knows? Stranger things have happened.
                  I'll just take a look around, and see——. The devil!' he exclaimed, as he arose to
                  examine an oil painting, which hung directly over the door, and beheld the
                  countenance of Estelle quietly looking in upon him.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
               <p>HOLLOWELL was struck dumb with surprise at the sudden appearance of Estelle, and
                  at first was almost inclined to believe that he was laboring under some singular
                  hallucination. After he had rubbed his eyes once or twice, however, and approached
                  close to the object which had so unceremoniously presented itself to his startled
                  gaze, he became satisfied that it was no apparition, but real flesh and blood, and
                  immediately that impudent self-assurance which seldom deserted him, returned, and
                  staring at Estelle steadily through his eye-glass, he uttered a long whistle
                  expressive of his surprise, and then striking a theatrical attitude, he remarked
                  in a serio-comic tone—</p>
               <p>'Can it be possible that I do once again behold thee, or am I the victim of some
                  tantalizing chimera? As Macbeth says, 'My eyes are made the fools o' the other
                  senses, or else worth all these rest.' It cannot be! and yet there is no doubt
                  about it! I never, surely, could mistake that meek, forgiving countenance, and
                  those mild, gentle eyes! It is!—no it isn't!—and yet it is!—there can be no
                  mistake about it—it is—my long-lost sister-in-law! O, come to my embrace! Let a
                  brother's arms enfold thee!'</p>
               <p>He sprang towards her, with a ludicrous gesture, as he finished speaking, but she
                  met him with a blow on the cheek with the flat of her hand which made everything
                  ring again, and caused his face to tingle with pain—</p>
               <p>'Take that, you senseless monkey!' she exclaimed, in a tone of rage—'I should
                  suppose that instead of playing the clown you would at such a moment as this fall
                  upon your knees and sue for pardon!'</p>
               <p>'Sister mine,' replied Hollowell, with the most unblushing effrontery, 'you are
                  rough—decidedly unfeminine—contact with the world has not tended to soften your
                  nature in the slightest degree—I am sorry for it—I don't see how I can do anything
                  for you unless you alter—I can't patronize you unless you show some signs of
                  amendment, and that speedily. How are you off in this world's goods? I know you
                  are full of spiritual wealth—your account with Heaven no doubt shows a handsome
                  balance in your favor—but how are you off with regard to the mundane—the
                  filthy—the collateral? Is this your establishment?' and he looked around the room
                  as though taking an inventory of the furniture.</p>
               <p>Estelle's bosom swelled with rage and indignation, as she listened to the
                  sarcastic language of the unprincipled adventurer. The expressions concerning her
                  piety which he let fall convinced her that he was fully cognizant of her guilty
                  conduct previous to her flight from her husband, and when she reflected that
                  Hollowell himself was partly instrumental in causing her fall by assisting in the
                  plot against her, she felt that she could, without the slightest compunction,
                  murder him where he stood if she had the power to do so, and glaring furiously
                  upon him, she replied—</p>
               <p>'I understand your sarcastic allusions, you worse than the devil, but if I am
                  steeped to the lips in sin, who made me what I am? Did not you among others,
                  conspire to rob me of my heart's peace, and drive me to distraction? Did you not
                  plot and contrive, and scheme, with a subtlety and malignity worthy<pb n="270-271"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000136"/> the arch fiend, to destroy the love and corrupt the
                  purity of two youthful hearts? and now how dare you make the base act the theme of
                  caustic sarcasm? <emph>You,</emph> who are even more criminal than I am, and with
                  less excuse?'</p>
               <p>'Crime is an unpleasant subject, and I don't like to talk about it,' said
                  Hollowell, slightly cowering beneath the intensity of her gaze—'as far as the
                  little short-comings to which human nature is prone are concerned, I am willing to
                  admit that we are, to use a homely phrase, 'tarred with the same stick'—so don't
                  let's say any more about it—but tell me, how have you made out since I saw you
                  last? Have you managed to save a pile? Who is that young fellow I came here with?
                  Are you and him in partnership? I am interested in asking, because I just managed
                  to bluff him out of a thousand, and I want to know if he is good for it.'</p>
               <p>'Shall I tell you what I am half-resolved to do?' asked Estelle, as her lip
                  quivered with passionate emotion.</p>
               <p>'Well, yes,' answered Hollowell, 'I'd as leave you would as not. I won't refuse my
                  advice, although you don't seem very well disposed towards me. What is it?'</p>
               <p>'You know I am not apt to say a thing without meaning it,' continued Estelle, 'and
                  I have half a mind to send for a policeman, and give myself up for the
                  satisfaction of having you arrested and brought to trial.'</p>
               <p>'Have you only half a mind to that effect?' said Hollowell, with nervous anxiety,
                  but still maintaining his tone of pleasantry—'then please keep the other half back
                  till some more fitting occasion—in the meantime, since you and the green one who
                  conducted me hither, are in cahoot, I won't trouble him for the thousand I beat
                  him out of, but let it go to the score of old acquaintance, and now, I think I'll
                  take my departure. But before I go, tell me, have you ever seen anything of that
                  crazy lover of yours—that Ely? When I was in St. Louis, not long since, (I just
                  passed through that way for a 'flyer,') I heard he was dead—it was rumored there
                  that he had been drowned at sea, and the old captain, his father, took it so much
                  to heart that he died in consequence. I wouldn't have mentioned the painful
                  subject, had it not suddenly occurred to me that your new lover resembled him
                  somewhat. I always dreaded him amazingly. He looked to me as if he had 'kill' in
                  his eye, and I never wanted to meet him after the match between you and him was
                  broken up. Did you ever learn any of the particulars of his death?'</p>
               <p>'No,' replied Estelle, and a malicious smile of satisfaction lighted up her dark
                  eyes as she spoke, 'I never did learn the particulars of his death, although I,
                  too, heard that he had been drowned at sea.'</p>
               <p>'Poor fellow!' exclaimed Hollowell, in a tone of mock solemnity, 'what a pity! So
                  young, and so promising, too! Well, 'in the midst of life we are in death.' We
                  must all go at one time or another, and we should try and be prepared! Good
                  evening, sister Emory. I wish you and your new partner every success, and if you
                  try to deserve my friendship, I may, perhaps, if you get very hard up, endeavor to
                  assist you. Good evening.'</p>
               <p>He started towards the door, but Estelle stepped in front of him, and barring the
                  passage, she said, in a determined voice—</p>
               <p>'We part not so. I have been looking for you anxiously for some days past, and now
                  that I have found you, I require certain information from you touching my family
                  before we part.'</p>
               <p>'Sorry to say I can't give you the slightest intelligence concerning them,' said
                  Hollowell, coolly. 'I have always tried to give them as wide a berth as possible,
                  and I don't know anything about them, and what is more, I wouldn't if I
                  could.'</p>
               <p>Hollowell was never idle in calculating the chances of making something, and the
                  moment Estelle discovered herself to him, he began to figure up in his own mind
                  the probable<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6405-00000137"/> amount which Everard Emory
                  would pay for a knowledge of her whereabouts, and he had determined to make the
                  best bargain he could. It was his intention to put the information which he had so
                  suddenly and so unexpectedly obtained, in the market, and if he could get more for
                  it from Emory than he could from his fortune-telling partners in iniquity, then he
                  resolved to turn traitor—sell the secret and his companions at the same time—get
                  possession of the price of his perfidy, and decamp at once. All this had passed
                  through his mind in a moment, and so he had determined to plead ignorance. But he
                  had a shrewder party to deal with than he had calculated upon. Estelle was not to
                  be put off so easily. So she maintained the position which she had assumed, and
                  replied quietly in answer to his professed ignorance—</p>
               <p>'That story might do very well, Mr. Cornelius Hollowell, to pass off upon one not
                  intimately acquainted with you, but you cannot hope to deceive me with any such
                  weak subterfuge. I know you and you know me. I must have what information you
                  possess before you leave these premises.'</p>
               <p>'What if I admit,' said Hollowell coolly, 'that I can gratify you if I please, and
                  still refuse to do it?'</p>
               <p>'Then I must force you into compliance,' was the laconic and determined reply.</p>
               <p>'Well, come, I like <emph>that!</emph>' said Hollowell, with a laugh—then suddenly
                  inserting his hand into the inside pocket of his coat, he drew forth a pistol,
                  deliberately cocked it, and assuming a fierce expression of countenance, he
                  continued—'stand aside—I have no occasion to draw a pistol upon you, but you are
                  doubtless not without help in the house, and I may need the weapon. It is needless
                  for me to assure you that he who attempts to stop my progress is a dead man, for
                  you know I will shoot. You are aware that I was led into such an act once before,
                  and the result was fatal, though not to the person shot at. This time, I will
                  venture to say no such mistake will be made, for besides being rather a better
                  marksman than formerly I have acquired a steadiness of nerve which in all such
                  little matters aids me exceedingly. So stand aside I say! Who now will dare to
                  stop me?'</p>
               <p>Estelle stood in the door-way opening into the hall, and Hollowell stood facing
                  her with his back towards the folding door separating the front and back rooms.
                  While they were conversing, James Ely, armed with a pistol, entered noiselessly by
                  the folding door, and approaching Hollowell cautiously from behind, stood directly
                  at his back, just as the enquiry 'who now will dare to stop me?' in a furious and
                  defiant tone, left his lip.</p>
               <p>'I will!' he exclaimed, as he suddenly wrenched the elevated weapon from the
                  sharper's hand, and at the same time levelled his own pistol full at the dupe's
                  head—'I! James Ely! Once the victim of your hellish plotting, but now your
                  master!'</p>
               <p>Hollowell was fairly paralyzed with apprehension and surprise, and for a moment he
                  trembled like an aspen leaf, but soon recovering his usual presence of mind, he
                  assumed the air of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">nonchalance</foreign> so natural to
                  him, and with admirable <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sang froid</foreign>
                  exclaimed—</p>
               <p>'Why, Jimmy my boy, is that you? Well, who'd have thought it? I certainly imagined
                  that you had 'shuffled off this mortal coil.' I was under the impression that you
                  were playing 'hide and seek,' or 'blind man's buff' or some such innocent game,
                  with the sea-nymphs at the bottom of the ocean—but for that I suppose I should
                  have recognized you at the bluff table, although you look about ten years older
                  than when I saw you last! Come, give us your hand.'</p>
               <p>Ely still kept the pistol levelled at his head, and with steady nerve and eyes
                  flashing fire, he exclaimed—</p>
               <p>'Dare to use the slightest resistance, or make the least effort to escape from
                  this house till I am through with you, and your life is not worth a moment's
                  purchase! You are fairly caught, and any effort to get away till we are disposed
                  to let you go<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6405-00000138"/> would be in vain. Every
                  door is locked and barred, and I have assistance at hand if it is necessary to
                  call for it. So you may as well yield at once.'</p>
               <p>'I see you've got the best of me,' said Hollowell, submissively, 'and it would be
                  nonsense for me to attempt to play my hand out when you have the game secured—so I
                  back down, and now what do you want with me?'</p>
               <p>'Nothing but what you can easily and ought readily to grant,' answered Ely, 'for
                  as you once operated against us without reason, so you ought now in atonement help
                  us to revenge. I am satisfied you know all about Emory and the rest of our
                     <emph>friends,</emph> and all I ask is that you give us such information as
                  will enable us to approach them without being known. In return for such a
                  concession on your part, I promise you most solemnly that we will not only not
                  interfere with any plans which you may have formed, or any game you may be
                  playing, but on the contrary will endeavor to assist to the best of our
                  ability—will we not, Estelle?' he asked, addressing his guilty partner.</p>
               <p>'Yes,' she answered, 'but if he refuses to do so, may every ill luck in the
                  catalogue of misfortune befall me, if I do not denounce him to the authorities,
                  even though by that act I bring my own neck into the halter. I have nothing but
                  revenge to live for—deprived of that, I wish to die, for life is valueless, to
                  me.'</p>
               <p>Hollowell meditated a while, and at length replied——</p>
               <p>'I suppose I might as well come to the point. I don't know but what it will pay
                  about as well in the long run to go in with you, as it will to operate on my own
                  hook. At all events it is safer, and it's better to make friends of enemies than
                  to trust to luck to escape their vengeance. So I will admit without further talk
                  that I <emph>do</emph> know all about Emory and the rest. I know every
                  circumstance that has transpired since you left home, and I know some things that
                  are to transpire. Now, how shall I begin? What shall I tell you first?'</p>
               <p>'In the first place,' asked Estelle, 'what has become of my father? I merely ask
                  for information, and not because I care a great deal, for I have not a
                  superabundance of affection for him.'</p>
               <p>'It won't take long to answer that question,' replied Hollowell; 'as near as I
                  could find out, your amiable husband first starved and abused him into idiocy, and
                  then sent him to the alms-house.'</p>
               <p>'A just punishment,' said Estelle, callously, 'for the unnatural parent, who for
                  the sake of gain would barter the eternal peace of his own child! but that does
                  not make the crime of Emory in persecuting him any the less heinous. The
                  rotten-hearted miscreant! O, for some plan to insure his ruin!—some subtle,
                  contrivance to bring about his death by degrees! Dissolution slow and in lingering
                  torments is the only fit way for him to leave this world! What of him?' she
                  continued enquiringly, 'what of Emory, the stony-hearted beast? Does he still seek
                  for his child?'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' replied Hollowell, 'and he would give half of what he's worth to gain
                  possession of it. But to save time, I may as well tell you the whole story. The
                  fact is then, that after Emory had sent the old man to the Alms House, he turned
                  your sister Florence (my dear wife, you know) out of doors to shift for herself.
                  Of course, you know that Fanny died of the poisoned wine you left for Emory?'</p>
               <p>He paused, and looked significantly at Estelle, as much as to say 'you see I am
                  well posted up in all the particulars.'</p>
               <p>'Yes, yes,' replied Estelle, impatiently, 'go on.'</p>
               <p>'Well,' continued Hollowell, 'she (Florence) went to the city, where Cantwell, the
                  confidential clerk of Emory, followed her, and proposed to her to start in the
                  business of fortune telling. She was glad to jump at almost anything, and accepted
                  at once. After they had started business, Cantwell, who hates Emory with a deadly
                  hatred, contrived it so that he was induced to make application to Florence, who
                  goes by<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6405-00000139"/> the name of Madame Duroc, for
                  intelligence concerning you and his infant. Of course, Florence, knowing all about
                  him, had a nice, easy thing of it, and was enabled to fool him to her heart's
                  content. It was just as they had brought him fairly into the traces, that I
                  accidentally stumbled upon the party, and forced them to take me as a partner in
                  the concern, and a nice, profitable and pleasant time we have had of it thus far,
                  I do assure you. Emory bleeds freely, and hasn't the slightest suspicion of the
                  trick of which he is the victim. He attributes the power possessed by Florence to
                  psychology, clairvoyance, or something of that kind, and religiously believes that
                  she will eventually restore to him his child, though of course she is as far from
                  doing it as ever. I didn't dream that Emory could have been so completely fooled!'
                  and Hollowell chuckled with delight as he ended his narrative.</p>
               <p>'He shall have his child,' said Estelle, smiling savagely—then after thinking a
                  moment she continued—'can you fetch my sister Florence here at once, Hollowell? If
                  you can, do so. You need not hesitate to give her the full particulars of this
                  interview. We are embarked in a common cause, and I entertain no enmity towards
                  her now.'</p>
               <p>'I think I can have her here in the course of an hour,' answered Hollowell.</p>
               <p>'Then I wish you would do so,' said Estelle, 'I have a project in view which I
                  think will pay well, and the sooner we get to work upon it the better.'</p>
               <p>Hollowell departed, and after he was gone, Estelle said, addressing Ely—</p>
               <p>'You don't think any great deal of your infant, do you, James?'</p>
               <p>'No,' was the heartless answer, 'I never should have brought it here, had you not
                  requested it.'</p>
               <p>'Then you would willingly part with it for the sake of insuring me revenge?'</p>
               <p>'You don't want to hurt it, do you?' said Ely, as a touch of pity was awakened for
                  the moment in his bosom.</p>
               <p>'No, no,' replied Estelle, with a smile, 'I merely want it brought up handsomely
                  upon <emph>his</emph> money—I want him to lavish his wealth and his affections
                  upon it till the proper time comes to open his eyes to the fact that he has
                  bestowed his care and attention upon my lover's child instead of his own.'</p>
               <p>'And will he not be able to recognize the infant, think you?' questioned Ely.</p>
               <p>'O, no,' replied Estelle, 'impossible—the child was but a few weeks old when I
                  left home. Besides they look very much alike—both have black eyes, and they are
                  nearly of the same age. I can give a certificate over my own signature declaring
                  the infant to be his own, and they can tell him that I am dead, and that they are
                  sworn to secrecy concerning the circumstances attending my decease. This will give
                  the whole affair a mysterious complexion which will induce him the more readily to
                  swallow the story.'</p>
               <p>'And your own infant,' questioned Ely, 'what disposition do you propose making of
                  that?'</p>
               <p>'O, I have thought of a fitting way to dispose of that,' answered Estelle, with a
                  fiendish look, 'that shall be well brought up too. It shall be an honor to its
                  father, never fear. Kate has her instructions already concerning it.'</p>
               <p>While the unprincipled couple were thus conversing, Hollowell was on his way to
                  the 'Palace of Mystery.' He had forgotten all about the gambling transaction in
                  the excitement which followed the scene which has just been described, and as he
                  walked along, he muttered—</p>
               <p>'Strange things do happen in this world, and no mistake! Now who'd ever thought of
                  meeting that couple at such a time and under such circumstances? I wonder what
                  they intend to do? But what's that to me, so long as I make a good thing of it? I
                  never stop to ask any questions—all I want is money, and it don't make much odds
                  to me how I get it."</p>
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6405-00000140"/>
               <p>He was startled from his reflections by a tap on the shoulder, and looking up who
                  should he behold but the man of the sinister countenance—his late partner in the
                  game of bluff.</p>
               <p>'Did you think you was goin' to get clear of me?' questioned that worthy, with a
                  suspicious expression of countenance. 'Wasn't the conditions open and shut, and an
                  equal 'div' between three of us? and now you want to slide with the pile, eh?
                  P'int!' and he held out his right hand with the palm upwards, and agitated the
                  digits thereof violently, expressive of his desire to finger his share of the
                  money.</p>
               <p>Hollowell was about to reply to him, when he was startled by a voice on the other
                  side of him, proceeding from the red-haired and coarse-featured man, who
                  exclaimed—</p>
               <p>'Yes, take and look-a-here! P'int! I ain't <emph>win</emph> anything these three
                  nights, and I'm broke—and I ain't a-goin' to 'low no sich sucker as you to get the
                  best o' me! D'yer know that? Pint, or I'll take and split yer nose! D'yer know
                  that, s-a-y?' And, as an earnest that he meant what he said, the red-haired and
                  coarse-featured man brought his heavy hand down forcibly upon the crown of
                  Hollowell's hat, fetching the article from its proper position on the top of the
                  head down over his eyes, nose and mouth.</p>
               <p>'Gentlemen,' he exclaimed, when he was able to articulate,' don't be violent. It's
                  all right, and I'll be fair with you, but have patience. The man hasn't paid me
                  yet.'</p>
               <p>'O, wind!' exclaimed the red-haired man, contemptuously—'here we've bin a-playin'
                  in pocket for the last three weeks and you've bin takin' your sheer, and now, when
                  you've made a big raise, you want to pass onto us—but you ain't a-goin' to, d'yer
                  know that? P'int! or I'll take and break yer eye!'</p>
               <p>'Come, old fel.,' said the man of the sinister countenance, persuasively, 'there's
                  no use a torkin'—you might as well p'int fust as last, for you've got to do
                  it.'</p>
               <p>'Gentlemen,' said Hollowell, earnestly, 'you are welcome to what money I've got
                  about me, which amounts to a few hundreds only. The thousand dollars I did not
                  get, and if you don't believe me you can search me.'</p>
               <p>They did search him, but found no more upon him than what he had acknowledged to,
                  whereat they were exceedingly wroth and somewhat disappointed. Especially was this
                  the case with the red-haired man, who, when he found he was not likely to get his
                  full share of the stealings, applied his thumb and fore-finger to the nose of
                  Hollowell, and twisted that unfortunate member so violently, that for an instant
                  its possessor was somewhat in doubt as to whether it still remained a portion of
                  his countenance or not. After he had thus, in a measure, satisfied his outraged
                  feelings, he addressed the object of his wrath as follows—</p>
               <p>'Now take and go—and if ever you 'tempt to play open and shut with me agin, do you
                  know what I'll take and do with you? I'll take and bust yer head! D'yer know
                  that?' and giving Hollowell a parting kick, as if to impress what he said more
                  forcibly upon him, he told the man of the sinister countenance to 'come along, and
                  let the d—d sucker go,' and they passed on.</p>
               <p>The fire of malice sparkled in the eyes of Hollowell, and his hand sought the
                  handle of his pistol in the breast-pocket of his coat, but it was not there. He
                  had forgotten the fact that he had left it lying on the floor in Estelle's
                  apartments, and merely muttering, 'Perhaps it's better as it is,' he passed on,
                  and soon reached Florence's house. He rang the bell, which was shortly answered by
                  the negro page Paul, of whom he enquired if there was any customer up-stairs?</p>
               <p>'Yes, massa,' answered Paul, 'massa Emory up dar.'</p>
               <p>'That's fortunate,' muttered Hollowell to himself; then addressing the negro, he
                  said, 'I must see your mistress before Emory goes away. You go up-stairs and give
                  her the wink to step into the private room where I will be in waiting. Do you
                  hear?'</p>
               <p>'Yes, massa,' answered the negro with a grin, 'Paul know<pb n="280-281"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000141"/> wot he 'bout—Paul neber make no mistake!' and
                  up-stairs he started followed by Hollowell, who entered a door leading from the
                  entry to the private apartment, while the negro knocked for admittance at the door
                  of the sanctum within which Emory and Florence were holding a consultation. The
                  negro managed the matter very adroitly, after being authorized by Florence, who
                  knew his knock, to enter. He made some plausible excuse for his intrusion, and as
                  soon as he could catch his mistress's eye, he managed by grimacing and pointing
                  towards the door of the apartment to make her understand what he meant, after
                  which he again disappeared. Florence soon found occasion to leave Emory alone for
                  a moment, when she entered the room in which Hollowell was waiting to receive her,
                  and great was her surprise and gratification both, when made acquainted with the
                  nature of the revealment he had to make She had put Emory off from time to time
                  with first one lie and then another, till he began to grow suspicious, and it was
                  necessary that something should be done to allay his doubts. At the very time when
                  the negro boy interrupted her, she was endeavoring to frame some story about his
                  child which should appear plausible, for he had told her that if the infant was
                  not at once forthcoming he would drop all further communication with her. She had
                  more than once thought of the expedient of endeavoring to procure a strange child
                  and to palm it off upon him as his own, but she saw a great difficulty in
                  procuring what should appear to him proof positive of its identity, and besides
                  the danger of his own offspring turning up at some time or other would always
                  exist, and such a contingency was frightful to contemplate, for it would at once
                  destroy her power over her enemy. But all these difficulties were now obviated. He
                  was indeed to have his child—his own child—(or at least Florence thought so, and
                  so did Hollowell, for that matter) and the power which such an achievement would
                  give her over the now doubting Emory tickled the pseudo fortune-teller mightily.
                  She did not stop to think what part Estelle and her lover might play in this new
                  act of the exciting drama. She gave no heed to that. All she wished was to do away
                  with the present danger and leave the future to take care of itself.</p>
               <p>Her countenance beamed with gratification as she re-entered the magic room (after
                  her interview with Hollowell) where Emory was impatiently waiting her return.</p>
               <p>'Eureka!' she cried exultingly, 'my art has conquered at last! After whole nights
                  of watching, and toil, and anxiety, my labors are rewarded! I have found thy
                  child!'</p>
               <p>'Where is it, then?' enquired Emory, with much anxiety.</p>
               <p>'Where I may lay my hands upon it at any time,' was the answer.</p>
               <p>'You have given me such proofs of your power heretofore,' said Emory, 'that I am
                  inclined to believe you, and yet it seems to me impossible that you should know
                  secrets which are hidden from the common eye. But if your singular second sight
                  enables you to search out the child, of course you must have a knowledge of its
                  mother also. What of her?'</p>
               <p>'She is dead,' was the reply, 'and her child is in the care of those who would
                  teach it to hate thee, if they were permitted to rear it, which they will not be,
                  for to-morrow night it will be in thy possession, and thine ardent longing will be
                  gratified.'</p>
               <p>'But shall I not know the parties to whom my child has been entrusted? Shall I not
                  see and talk with them so that all doubts o my child's identity will be
                  removed?'</p>
               <p>'Not at present,' was the answer, 'such a thing would be impossible. Hereafter
                  thou mayst know more, but now I can only assure thee that proofs incontestible,
                  and such as thou must perforce believe, will be furnished thee that the child is
                  thine own. Let this satisfy thee. And now, farewell, for my time is precious. I
                  shall expect a larger sum than thou hast yet bestowed upon me, when I place the
                  infant within thine arms.'</p>
               <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6405-00000142"/>
               <p>'You shall have it,' replied Emory, 'if you remove every doubt, but not
                  otherwise.'</p>
               <p>'Enough,' said Florence, haughtily, 'I will not exact it otherwise. And now, once
                  more, farewell, for I would be alone.'</p>
               <p>Thus admonished for the second time Emory took his departure, and the door had no
                  sooner closed upon him, than Florence's two confederates, Cantwell and Hollowell,
                  entered through the private door, and after indulging in a hearty laugh at the
                  expense of Emory, the three took their departure for the residence of Estelle.</p>
               <p>They reached there without accident, and found the depraved couple waiting to
                  receive them. It was a strange reunion, and one calculated to call up unpleasant
                  reflections in the minds of all concerned. At the sight of Florence the hearts of
                  Estelle and James Ely at once began to swell with rage and indignation, as the
                  recollection of the deep wrongs which she had inflicted upon them came in their
                  minds, while Florence instantly felt that such was the case, and the consequence
                  was a freezing coldness of a few moments duration, which rendered the scene an
                  exceedingly unpleasant one to the whole party. Even Hollowell for the time being,
                  lost his imperturbable self assurance, and was evidently ill at ease, but soon an
                  allusion, on the part of Cantwell, to the matter which called them together,
                  changed the current of their thoughts, and business absorbed every other idea.</p>
               <p>'So it is really your intention, Estelle, is it,' asked Florence, after mutual
                  enquiries concerning past affairs had passed between them, 'to deliver up your
                  child to the custody of its father?'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' answered Estelle, 'after much reflection I have come to the determination
                  to pursue that course. I think it my duty to do so.'</p>
               <p>This reply and the tone in which it was uttered somewhat startled Florence, for
                  she began to fear that Estelle had relented ted, and might perhaps herself go back
                  to her husband. This would not have suited her, for she had led Emory to believe
                  that Estelle was dead, and his faith in the infallibility of her second sight
                  would have been considerably shaken had he learned that she was yet above
                  ground.</p>
               <p>'Then you have repented of the course which you so very justly, in my opinion,
                  pursued in running away from him?' she said, enquiringly, and in an ironical
                  manner—'well, I gave you credit for more spirit! Perhaps you will go back to him
                  again, and put up with his taunts, and inuendos, and ill usage? But I doubt
                  somewhat if he would receive you. I'm sure he would not, unless you went down upon
                  your knees to him and begged his pardon in the most abject manner, for his
                  amiability has not increased a jot during your absence.'</p>
               <p>A look of the deepest malignity, settled upon the features of Estelle as she
                  answered with terrible calmness—</p>
               <p>'Florence, it is evident that although the same mother bore us both, you do not
                  know me. What! go back to <emph>him!</emph> Ask <emph>his</emph> pardon! Listen to
                  me, all of you. I speak freeely, because I know, that every one here has suffered
                  injury at his hands and would gladly be revenged upon him. I do not wish him to
                  know of my existence—much less of my place of abode—I wish to be as dead in his
                  imagination, as I will ever be alive to revenge. Day and night will I hang upon
                  his trail like his own shadow—unrelentingly will I pursue him till perseverance
                  reward me with the full measure of revenge which I covet. I will lend all my
                  energies—every thought and feeling—to the compassing of his destruction. In the
                  broad glare of day I will plot his ruin, and during the still watches of the night
                  I will lie in wait for him. This will I do here, and if it is possible to continue
                  the pursuit in that other land of mystery, I will become a servant of Satan, if by
                  so doing I can sink him lower, lower, lower, into the fathomless depths of
                  unutterable woe!'</p>
               <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6405-00000143"/>
               <p>'If such are your feelings towards him,' asked Florence, 'why do you gratify him
                  by restoring to him his child?'</p>
               <p>'I have a purpose to serve by so doing,' replied Estelle, 'and this answer must
                  suffice for the present. I will now draw up a statement concerning myself and the
                  child which will satisfy him that he is its father. This you can say was found
                  upon me after death.' Seating herself at a table she executed the document, which
                  she handed to Florence, and then continued, 'now all I ask is that one of you
                  confer with me daily, and keep me advised of his movements—in the meantime I will
                  study how I may annoy him. It will go hard if the united efforts of half-a-dozen
                  heads cannot cause one to lie uneasily upon its pillow.'</p>
               <p>After some further talk Florence and her confederates departed, taking with them
                  the child of Ely, which Estelle had led them to suppose was her own son, and the
                  next night it was duly placed in the possession of Emory, who perfectly convinced
                  from the document which Estelle had drawn up that it was his own, was well nigh
                  beside himself with joy.</p>
               <p>It was only a few days afterwards that Estelle, accompanied by Kate O'Donnell,
                  went out with her own infant, and returned some hours afterwards, much to the
                  surprise of Ely, without it. He had no particular interest in the matter, however,
                  and as his unscrupulous companion offered no explanation voluntarily, he did not
                  seek to draw one from her, and it was not long before he forgot that either her
                  offspring or his own ever existed.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
               <p>THE occurrences which happened during the sixteen years succeeding the events thus
                  far detailed, need but slight notice and the author will briefly allude to the
                  movements of the different characters, in order that the reader may not be left
                  entirely in the dark concerning them.</p>
               <p>It is perhaps needless to state that the individual who waylaid and knocked down
                  Robert Barker, on his return towards home from the double wedding, was employed to
                  do so by Emory, who, beside himself with passion at having been foiled in every
                  attempt to hurt the reputation of the youth, had resorted to the desperate
                  expedient of employing a ruffian to knock out his brains. In this, however, he
                  also signally failed, for Barker, although severely, was not dangerously hurt, and
                  was confined but a few days from the injuries he sustained.</p>
               <p>The young man was perfectly satisfied as to who had been instrumental in causing
                  the murderous attack upon him, but as he had no proof of the fact, he let the
                  matter pass over, and was careful not to expose himself thereafter. His unceasing
                  vigilance procured him immunity from any second attempt at assassination, but it
                  could not prevent his enemies from hurling at him, as before, the poisoned shafts
                  of calumny and misrepresentation. At almost every turn he was met by<pb
                     n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6405-00000144"/> some fresh proof of the malignity of
                  Emory and his tools, who did not stop in their endeavors to ruin his character as
                  a Christian, but went so far as to address anonymous letters to Helen Wallace,
                  warning her to beware of him as a wolf in sheep's clothing, and relating many
                  stories, (which had no foundation in truth, of course,) of his immorality and
                  hypocrisy. Their unholy labors were all in vain, however, for fortunately Helen
                  had other correspondents than these unscrupulous parties—friends tried and true,
                  who had her welfare at heart, and who would not have misrepresented facts to her
                  injury, not for the wealth of the Indies. These friends wrote her how noble were
                  the efforts made by her lover for regeneration—how unceasingly he strove by acts
                  of Christian benevolence and brotherly love to cancel the errors of the past, and
                  to gain the esteem and approbation of his fellow men.—This was sufficient, and
                  three months after Barker had officiated as groomsman at the wedding of Jack
                  Ainslie, he led the girl whom he so dearly loved to the altar. The happy event had
                  anything but a consolatory effect upon the vindictive nature of Emory, who chafed
                  like a foiled tiger when he heard of it; but there were events more unpalatable
                  than this in store for him, during the sixteen years alluded to. In the first
                  place he was arraigned at the bar of public opinion for the part he acted towards
                  old Mr. Grant, who died in the most abject misery in the almshouse, and a
                  statement of whose case, including the manner in which he was swindled by Emory,
                  at the commencement of their acquaintance, very singularly found its way into the
                  newspapers. Hardly had the agony of mind which this exposure occasioned him been
                  somewhat allayed, when he was arrested at the instance of the uncle of the
                  deceased Jeannette Matthews, and taken to Troy to answer the charge of being a
                  party to the procurement of abortion. After much trouble, and spending
                  considerable money, he escaped conviction upon this charge, the nature of the
                  testimony not being exactly satisfactory on account of the length of time which
                  had elapsed between the commission of the offence and the trial. He went back to
                  New York after this, crest-fallen and dispirited, but it was only to meet fresh
                  trouble—for during his absence a piece of property belonging to him, valued at
                  between forty and fifty thousand dollars, was burnt to the ground just after the
                  policy of insurance had expired. Not long after this, Cantwell, whom he had all
                  along suspected of operating against him, decamped to Europe in company with
                  Florence, robbing him of a large sum of money, and cheating Hollowell at the same
                  time.</p>
               <p>This combination of untoward events well nigh unseated his reason, and while he
                  was casting about him for some means of satisfaction, Hollowell made bold to
                  present himself, and to offer his services in assisting the miserable man to
                  recover his money.</p>
               <p>Emory's first impulse was to have Hollowell arrested—but, upon taking a sober
                  second thought, it occurred to him that Hollowell, although he was not to be
                  trusted in pecuniary affairs, might yet be of use to him, and so he restrained his
                  anger, and listened to what the adventurer had to say. Hollowell felt savage at
                  having been duped by Cantwell and Florence, and he did not hesitate to make a
                  clean breast of the matter. He related to Emory everything that had transpired,
                  and even told him where his wife and her lover were then staying. He also informed
                  Emory that he suspected, from what he had heard, that Estelle had been mainly
                  instrumental in bringing about everything which had befallen him, except, perhaps,
                  the flight of Cantwell.</p>
               <p>The depraved man gnashed his teeth with rage as he listened to Hollowell's
                  story—and when he had heard him through, he determined upon the arrest of Estelle
                  at once.—Nor was it revenge alone which prompted him to take this course. He was
                  afraid of his vindictive wife, and he could not rest easy while he knew that she
                  was near him, and at liberty. He trembled for the safety of his child, too. He
                     had<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6405-00000145"/> learned to love the infant, and,
                  as it was the only object which had ever awakened one warm feeling in his cold and
                  selfish heart, the sentiment was doubly strong because it was novel. The fact that
                  Estelle had been so willing to give up the child, remarking at the same time that
                  she had an object in so doing—all which Hollowell was careful to explain to
                  Emory—made it palpable enough that she had formed some dreadful project which she
                  intended to act upon when the fitting time arrived; and he determined, if
                  possible, to frustrate her intentions, by procuring her arrest on a charge of
                  murder.</p>
               <p>While he was making his preparations to this end, however, Estelle was not idle.
                  She was made aware of the flight of Cantwell and Florence at the same time that
                  Hollowell was—and, well knowing the character of the latter, she naturally
                  concluded what course he would pursue under the circumstances, and she determined
                  to leave New York immediately, and to remain absent until the danger was over.
                  Accordingly she and Kate O'Donnell started on a trip to Cincinnati, leaving Ely
                  behind to watch the progress of events—and when Hollowell called the next morning,
                  at the direction of Emory, to keep Estelle in conversation till preparations for
                  her arrest were made, he found the house in possession of a pawnbroker who
                  exhibited a bill of sale for the furniture, which he said he had purchased the day
                  before, 'all in de lump.'</p>
               <p>Here again Emory was baffled, and he wept tears of rage when Hollowell informed
                  him of his wife's escape. If he had felt sure she would stay away he would have
                  been perfectly satisfied, but the conviction forced itself upon him that she would
                  not remain absent long, and this caused him great uneasiness.</p>
               <p>Time passed on, however, and as he heard nothing of her, he began to imagine that
                  her fears would keep her from ever troubling him again, and he grew quite easy in
                  his mind so far as she was concerned. But although he never knew of her presence,
                  she was often near him, and she made herself felt, too. Two or three different
                  times was his house entered by burglars, and twice did he suffer pecuniary loss
                  from incendiary fires which she had caused to be lighted, but he never for a
                  moment suspected her agency in the matter, for no attempt had been made to deprive
                  him of his greatest treasure—his child—and he imagined that her first hostile
                  demonstration on her return would be made in that direction.</p>
               <p>His boy—or rather Ely's boy—grew finely, and often, as Emory gazed in his fine,
                  intelligent eyes, and parted the golden curls upon his intellectual brow, a
                  feeling of selfish gratification would creep into his sordid heart to reflect how
                  bright a representative he should leave behind him when he had passed away. Not
                  that he cared anything for virtue for its own sake, but he knew that the world
                  generally believed in the trite adage, 'like father, like son,' and his very
                  stubbornness led him to wish that the adage might for once be made a lie. So he
                  lavished every care upon the boy, whom he had named Everard, after himself, and
                  had the satisfaction of seeing him at sixteen, an exceedingly intelligent and
                  correct-minded youth, and the idol of the college in which he had placed him.</p>
               <p>Year after year, however, the once wealthy hypocrite grew poorer, everything went
                  wrong with him—his speculations failed—loss after loss came upon him—misfortune
                  met him at every turn—and when he placed young Everard in college, the fear for
                  the first time arose in his mind that he might become so reduced as to be unable
                  to carry out his intentions concerning the youth. The thought was frightful to
                  him, and he determined to resort to any means, however dishonest, to prevent such
                  a state of affairs.</p>
               <p>Hollowell stuck close by Emory notwithstanding all his misfortunes—not of course
                  because he had any friendship for him, but because he had a tolerably easy time of
                  it, and because he calculated on the possession, some day or other, of the whole
                  of his (Emory's) property. As age grew upon him,<pb n="290-291"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000146"/> Emory lost a great degree of that shrewdness which
                  had characterized his early life—his perceptive faculties were not so acute—his
                  mind was less active, and his firmness somewhat shaken. Hollowell perceived this,
                  and he was not slow to take advantage of it, by operating upon Emory to suit his
                  own purposes. So successful was he in his operations that he soon wormed himself
                  into the complete confidence of his employer, whose distrust of him at first was
                  so great that he would not even speak to him upon matters of business. Having
                  arrived at this point, Hollowell began weaving a net in which to enmesh his
                  victim. At first he hinted distinctly at what might be done to ensure a fortune,
                  and when he noticed that the hint called forth no token of displeasure, he
                  ventured to suggest openly, that if Emory would obtain goods to a large amount by
                  representing himself as perfectly sound, it would be the easiest thing in the
                  world for him to pass his property over to him (Hollowell,) and thus
                     <emph>do</emph> his creditors. He might perhaps lay himself open to an action
                  for false pretences, but it would amount to nothing—a few hundreds at most would
                  make it all right, and when he had got through with the law he could resume
                  possession of his property. Hollowell did not want anything for his services—(so
                  he said)—all he wanted was a home and a little pocket money—Emory might advance
                  him cash enough if he pleased to enable him to embark, on a limited scale, in the
                  auction business—and this was all he would ask for. The bait took. Emory did
                  precisely as Hollowell wished him to, thus placing himself entirely in the
                  latter's power, and while the one was employed in swindling tradesmen, the other
                  was driving a flourishing trade in the mock auction line.</p>
               <p>While this was going on, Estelle never lost sight of her victim more than a few
                  months, at most, at a time. Her life was spent in travelling around from place to
                  place—north, east, south and west—for Ely had turned gambler, and a gambler's life
                  is necessarily an erratic one—but she returned to the city as often as possible,
                  and when absent, she had those in her pay who kept her well advised of all that
                  was going on. She had a double object in visiting New York frequently, as will
                  appear in the course of our narrative.</p>
               <p>For some years Ely was very successful in his disreputable profession, and they
                  got along smoothly enough; but wickedness cannot always flourish, and a
                  circumstance at last happened which cut short the career of one of the guilty
                  pair, and left the other nearly destitute. Ely got into a quarrel with a
                  Southerner while playing cards on board one of the Mississippi steamers, in the
                  course of which he was fatally stabbed, and died in a few hours afterwards.
                  Estelle had his body conveyed to New Orleans for interment, after which she and
                  Kate O'Donnell once more returned to New York. Here poverty soon overtook them,
                  and they were obliged to part with, one by one, every article of value which they
                  possessed, and finally they made the acquaintance of and co-operated with—though
                  so slyly as to escape the surveillance of the police—some of the most desperate
                  characters.</p>
               <p>Such was the state of affairs at the commencement of our next chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
               <p>IT was a bleak night in November, when Estelle Emory and Kate O'Donnell sat in the
                  basement of a respectable-looking house in Bleecker street, New York. The
                  apartment was miserably furnished, although an exterior view of the house would
                  indicate that its tenants were, at least, respectable mechanics. This was, indeed,
                  the case. The upper portion of the house was occupied by persons not actually in
                  want, and Estelle had chosen the premises on that account. It mattered not to the
                  landlord what style of furniture his tenants were possessed of, so long as he got
                  his rent, which he did invariably in advance, so Estelle found no difficulty in
                  securing the place, notwithstanding that she had little or nothing to put in it. A
                  couple of strips of rag carpet, four common chairs, a trunk and a cot bedstead,
                  were the only articles of furniture the room could boast of. A piece of a tallow
                  candle was burning in a tin candlestick upon the dirty mantel-piece, and a few
                  embers were smouldering on the cheerless hearth. Over these the two wretched
                  creatures, side by side, sat shiverings and as the cold night breeze whistled
                  through the key-hole with a mournful sound, or rudely shook the window casement,
                  they pulled their wretched garments more closely around them, and crept further
                  into the fire-place.</p>
               <p>'It's cold, Kate,' said Estelle, 'very cold!' and as she spoke, she shuddered
                  involuntarily, and her teeth slightly chattered.</p>
               <p>'Thrue for you,' replied Kate, 'but sure it isn't so cowld as it will be whin the
                  snow is on the ground and the white frost is on the windy-panes. Och, murther! iv
                  it's starvin' we are wid the cowld now, fhat'll we do thin, misthress, dear?'</p>
               <p>'I've thought of it, Kate,' answered Estelle, as she turned her lack-lustre eyes
                  upon her uncouth-looking attendant; 'but I have no fears for myself. I have a
                  strange presentiment that I shall die before this winter is over, but not before I
                  taste of that sweet revenge for which I have waited so many years. After that I
                  don't wish to live. I would sooner die than not.'</p>
               <p>'An' troth it's little I'd care for life afther yerself is gone,' answered Kate,
                  'for wot 'ud I be doin' widout you?'</p>
               <p>'Kate,' said Estelle, after a slight pause, 'during the whole time that I have
                  been knocking about the world, you are the only true friend I have ever had. From
                  the time when you first decided to share my fortunes, you have never deserted me,
                  and as we have lived together, so I hope we will die together.'</p>
               <p>'It's mesilf that hopes that same,' answered Kate, 'for sure no wan would care for
                  the likes o' me iv you wor under the sod.'</p>
               <p>A silence of some moments ensued, when, at length, Estelle, heaving a heavy sigh,
                  exclaimed—</p>
               <p>'Ugh, how I shiver! Put on that other stick of wood, Kate—I feel as though I had
                  an ague-chill.'</p>
               <p>Kate did as she was desired, and having, by a vigorous blowing, called forth a
                  sickly flame from the dying embers, she looked up at Estelle, and remarked—</p>
               <p>'It's betther for ye to take a little gin, misthress—it'll war-m ye.'</p>
               <p>'I don't know but it will do me good,' replied Estelle, and you may pour me out a
                  little.'</p>
               <p>Kate went to the closet, and taking forth a junk bottle and<pb n="294-295"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000148"/> a broken tea-cup, turned out about a gill of the
                  liquid, which Estelle swallowed with a gusto which proved too plainly how fast a
                  hold the baneful practice had taken upon her. Kate followed the example of her
                  mistress, and had just placed the articles in the closet again, when a quick
                  footfall descended the basement steps, and the next moment a knock was heard at
                  the door.</p>
               <p>'It is Dick,' said Estelle; 'shut the closet door and take your seat, Kate, so
                  that he will not suspect anything.' Kate did so, and raising her voice, Estelle
                  exclaimed, 'Come in!'</p>
               <p>The door opened, and a boy about sixteen years of age—but who, from the effects of
                  early dissipation, looked much older—entered the apartment, and stood gazing
                  steadily first at one and then at the other of its occupants. He was rather comely
                  in feature, but his face wore a look of desperate recklessness frightful to behold
                  in one so young, and every bad passion to which human nature is liable, seemed to
                  lurk in the depths of his wild-looking sloe-black eyes.</p>
               <p>'What news, Dick?' asked Estelle; 'any luck lately?'</p>
               <p>Without replying to her interrogatory, the boy advanced close to her, and stooping
                  over, he said:</p>
               <p>'Blow in my eye, Aunty, will you?'</p>
               <p>'Nonsense,' replied Estelle, 'you're always thinking about drinking. You must have
                  an idea we are always at it.'</p>
               <p>'I don't care whether you are always at it or not,' replied the youth, 'I smell
                  gin, and I'm goin' to have some. Kate, get me some gin!'</p>
               <p>Kate looked at Estelle, as though to ask her wishes in the matter.</p>
               <p>'I suppose you might as well give him some,' said Estelle, 'he won't rest
                  satisfied without it. But be careful, don't give him too much.'</p>
               <p>'Oh, gas!' exclaimed the boy, contemptuously, and following the classical remark
                  up with an oath, he snatched the bottle from the hands of Kate O'Donnell just as
                  she brought it forth from the closet for the second time, and pouring out nearly a
                  cup full he took it down at a swallow.</p>
               <p>'That's the kind!' he said, smacking his lips, 'I ain't had a drink before this
                  two hours, and I was as dry as a chip.'</p>
               <p>'Well, don't talk so loud,' said Estelle, 'there are respectable people living in
                  this house, and I shouldn't like any of them to hear you.'</p>
               <p>'D——n the people!' was the reply, in a still louder tone, 'what d'yer s'pose I
                  care for the people?'</p>
               <p>'That's always the way with you,' said Estelle, deprecatingly, 'you never can
                  drink a drop without getting either yourself or some of your friends into
                  difficulty. If you don't sit down at once and be quiet, you shall never drink
                  another drop in this house while I have the power to prevent it.'</p>
               <p>This threat had the desired effect, and the boy seated himself.</p>
               <p>'Now, then,' said Estelle, 'what is there new? Anything?'</p>
               <p>'No, nothing worth speaking of,' answered the boy; then suddenly recollecting
                  himself, he continued. 'Oh, you know that old buffer you've bin wanting me to rob
                  for a long time past?' Emory, his name is, ain't it?'</p>
               <p>Estelle nodded affirmatively.</p>
               <p>'Well,' continued the boy, 'I come one o' the best dodges over him yesterday
                  afternoon I ever come over anybody in my life.'</p>
               <p>'What was it, Dick?' asked Estelle, eagerly, 'what was it, my son?'</p>
               <p>'Why, you see,' replied Dick, 'I was loafing around the house to see how it was
                  situated, so that I'd know better how to operate if I did get into it at any time.
                  Well, as I was takin' observations from the opposite side of the street, I saw the
                  kitchen wench come out o' the basement and go into the corner grocery. 'Now,'
                  thinks I, 'that wench very like left the basement door unlatched, so's she can get
                  in agin without trouble, and if she has done so, where's the harm of my
                     exammin'<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6405-00000149"/> min' the inside as well as
                  the outside of the house?' So over I goes, and sure enough the door was unlatched,
                  and in I went. I made up my mind that if I met anybody on the stairs I'd enquire
                  for Mr. Emory and tell him some some cock-an'-bull story 'bout somebody in
                  Wall-street wantin' to see him. I passed along upon tip-toe, and hearin' voices in
                  the parlor I didn't stop there, but kept on up, and brought up in front of the
                  first door I met after mountin' the second flight. I listened for some time, but
                  didn't hear anything—then I put my eye to the key-hole, and as I didn't see
                  anybody, I just opened the door softly and went in. There was very handsome
                  furniture in the room, and among other things there was a splendid book case, and
                  writing desk, and lots of books. There was a small tin box on a chair in front of
                  the book-case, fastened with a padlock, and as it looked as though it might
                  contain valuables, I was jest goin' to try to force it open, when I heard
                  footsteps on the stairs. I was afraid somebody might be comin' to the room I was
                  in, and the fust idea that entered my head was to lock the door. I didn't like to
                  do that, though, if I could help it, for there was danger in it; and as I glanced
                  around the room I noticed that there was plenty of room for me under the sofa, and
                  under there I passed as quick as thought. I hadn't more'n got myself comfortably
                  stowed away when sure enough the door opened, and in came old Emory (at least I
                  'spect it was him,) and his son.</p>
               <p>'There seemed to have been a quarrel between 'em before they entered the room
                  about the boy's mother, for when they seated themselves onto the sofa just over
                  me, the old man ses, 'Everard, you're an ungrateful boy to take sides against your
                  father who has reared you from infancy and always loved you, in favor of a vile
                  baggage who deserted you when you most needed her attention and who never felt any
                  affection for you!' My eyes! you ought to heard how the boy talked back!</p>
               <p>'Father,' ses he, 'if what Mr. Hollowell said in the conversation which I
                  accidentally overheard between you, is true, my mother had some excuse for not
                  acting right, and you should be the last one to apply harsh terms to her. O,
                  father, (and then I could hear the little fool snivle,) you say you half suspect
                  that she is in the city now, and that it is your intention to hunt her out and
                  give her into the hands of justice! Do you think that God would ever pardon such a
                  crime as that? Do you think that I could ever love you afterwards! O, no, I could
                  not! If my mother is really the wicked woman you say she is, do search her out,
                  but not to punish her—take her by the hand, and lead her home, and tell her you
                  forgive her and will pardon her for the sake of her child. Treat her kindly as you
                  have ever treated me, and learn her to love you as I love you! Do this, father,
                  and God will bless you!'</p>
               <p>'Well, the old man, instead o' seemin' to have his soft tetched by this, jumped
                  off the sofa and tore about the room for a time like an actor in a passion.</p>
               <p>'You undutiful young scoundrel,' he yelled out at last, 'you must choose between
                  your mother and me! Either you must promise never to say a word in her favor
                  again, or you must leave this house forever and take care of yourself as you best
                  may. Now, sir, give me your decision!'</p>
               <p>'And wot d'yer think the young greeny did?' said Dick, when he had got thus far
                  into the narrative.</p>
               <p>'I don't know—what did he do, Dick?' replied Estelle, who as well as Kate
                  O'Donnell had been listening with the most intense interest.</p>
               <p>'Why,' answered Dick, 'he turned towards the door, and with the tears a-streamin'
                  down his cheeks, he ses, 'well, then, good bye, father, and God bless you! It is
                  hard, but I must leave you, for I never can cease to plead for my poor mother when
                  I think that she perhaps may be friendless and homeless, while I am surrounded by
                  plenty!'</p>
               <p>'How would you have done if you had been in his place, Dick?' enquired Estelle,
                  and her thin lip quivered with emotion as she put the question.</p>
               <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6405-00000150"/>
               <p>'Why, you must be jolly green to ask,' answered Dick, 'I wouldn't give up a
                  comfortable home and plenty rocks to spend for twenty mothers—not if I saw 'em all
                  starvin' in the gutter before my eyes.'</p>
               <p>'I thought so,' exclaimed Estelle, as a snake-like expression gleamed in her black
                  eyes—'I thought so, didn't you, Kate?'</p>
               <p>'Troth I did!' was the laconic but expressive answer.</p>
               <p>'Of course you thought so,' said Dick, 'how could you think anything else? You've
                  bin acquainted with me long enough to know that there ain't nothin' green about
                  me.'</p>
               <p>'Yes, yes,' replied Estelle hastily, 'but go on—how, did it end? did he let the
                  boy go?'</p>
               <p>'Why, you seem to be very anxious about it,' said Dick, 'one would think you was
                  concerned in the matter!' then without waiting for a reply he continued, 'No, he
                  didn't let the boy go. Jist as be had his hand on the door knob the old fellow
                  called him back again. 'Stop, sir!' ses he, 'I b'leve I am your father, and I have
                  the right to command you! You shall neither leave my protection, nor shall you
                  have an opportunity of mentioning this hateful subject again. To-morrow you return
                  to College!'</p>
               <p>'As you please, sir,' ses the boy.</p>
               <p>'Out of my sight! you ungrateful hound!' ses the old man furiously, 'begone to
                  your room, and stay there till I send for you.'</p>
               <p>'The boy left, and after he was gone, the old man placed the tin box up on the
                  writing desk, took a key out of his pocket, unlocked it, and began fumblin' over a
                  lot of papers and mutterin' to himself. 'I wonder,' ses he, 'if I'm never to be
                  rid of her! Hollowell says he thinks he caught a glimpse of her in the street, but
                  was so situated at the time that he could not follow her. Psha! he must have been
                  mistaken. She would not be in this city long without causing me to
                     <emph>feel</emph> her presence, if I did not <emph>see</emph> her!'</p>
               <p>'After mutterin' a lot more such stuff as this which I don't remember, he left the
                  room, and after he had vamosed I crept out o' my hidin' place and was very glad to
                  find that he had gone off and left the key in the box. I had made up my mind to
                  steal box and all while I was under the sofa, but I had no occasion to do so when
                  I could get into it without any difficulty, so I opened it expectin' to see a big
                  pile of shiners, and I came near swearin' out loud to observe that there wasn't
                  nothin' into it except a lot of papers and a lady's portrait.'</p>
               <p>'Did you steal them?' asked Estelle eagerly.</p>
               <p>'Not all of 'em,' answered Dick, 'I put the portrait in my pocket, and had just
                  picked up a small package of letters when I heard footsteps again, and cramming
                  the package also in my pocket, I made tracks for my hiding place again. It was the
                  old man, who must in his excitement have forgotten to lock the box, and had
                  returned for the purpose of doin' it. I'd have been in a tight place if he'd
                  examined it and missed what was gone out of it, but he didn't. He jist merely
                  locked the box and then took it off with him. I don't know how it was,' continued
                  Dick, with a singular expression of countenance, 'but may I be cursed if I didn't
                  feel when I crawled out from under that sofa the second time, as if I had a
                  natural right to everything in that house, and as though I'd jist as leave any one
                  would catch me there as not. The feelin' only lasted for a minit, but during' that
                  minit, if I hadn't a knode my name was Waffles, d—n me if I wouldn't a thought it
                  was Emory and that savage old duck was my father.'</p>
               <p>Estelle trembled in every joinit (although the boy did not observe it) as she
                  remarked in a tone of forced calmness—</p>
               <p>'Don't talk such nonsense, Dick—let me see the portraits and the letters—have you
                  them with you?'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' answered the boy, as he inserted his hand in his pocket and pulled the
                  articles forth—'here they are, and there's something very sing'lar about the
                  portrait, too—you'll<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6405-00000151"/> laugh when I tell
                  you what I think—I think it looks just like you might have looked when you was a
                  young woman.'</p>
               <p>'Nonsense,' said Estelle, as she took the portrait and gazed thoughtfully upon
                  it—'do you think it possible I ever could have looked like that? Would you
                  suppose, Kate,' she continued, turning to her companion and drawing her attention
                  to the likeness, 'that a creature so young, and beautiful, and innocent-looking as
                  that, could by harsh treatment and battling with the world, change to such a
                  haggard, careworn wretch as I am?' There was a bitterness in her words which Kate
                  well understood as she answered—</p>
               <p>'Divil a likelihood in it at all, at all, misthress dear—sure it's dhramin' the
                  boy is. The whiskey don't agree wid him.'</p>
               <p>'I would have pawned the picture,' said Dick, without paying any attention to the
                  remark of Kate, 'but I didn't think it would be exactly safe to do so just yet, so
                  I brought it to you. You generally do about as well with my property as anybody I
                  can trust it with.'</p>
               <p>'That's right, Dick,' answered Estelle, encouragingly, 'always bring whatever you
                  get to me and you shan't lose anything by it,' and as she spoke she arose to place
                  the miniature and the papers in her trunk.</p>
               <p>'What are you going to do with the papers, Aunty?' enquired Dick, 'what's into
                  'em?'</p>
               <p>'O, I don't suppose they are of any importance,' answered Estelle; 'I don't feel
                  like looking over them to-night—I had rather take daylight for it and I guess I'd
                  let them go till tomorrow.'</p>
               <p>'I wish that old swell-head mother of mine had a learned me how to read, and then
                  I could a' looked over them myself,' said Dick, doggedly; 'I don't know one letter
                  from another 'ceptin' when I see 'em painted on signs, and I wouldn't a knowed
                  that much if I hadn't a learned it without bein' showed.'</p>
               <p>'O, never mind, Dick,' said Estelle, soothingly; 'learning isn't of much
                  importance after all. Picking a pocket neatly is a greater accomplishment than
                  being able to read. But what have you been about for a month past? Is the job you
                  have been telling me of the only one you've accomplished?'</p>
               <p>'No,' answered Dick, 'myself and two of the other boys did a little something in
                  our line last night. We came near gittin' caught twice before, we made anything,
                  though. We started on a wharf lay, and went on board of two schooners to see if we
                  could pick up anything; but we was chased both times, and then we made up our
                  minds to go round to Jack Ketch's crib in Water street, and wait till it was a
                  little late. On our way there, we stopped into a place to get a drink, and here we
                  came across an old fellow who was about drunk enough to be foolish, and we mixed
                  in with him. He got tellin' us about bein' done out of fifty dollars by the mock
                  auction dodge, and askin' us how he should go to work to git his money back agin.
                  Of course we felt very sorry for him, and told him all about what a set of scamps
                  there was in the city, and all that sort of gammon—then we treated him once or
                  twice, and at last we got him to go with us. We took him down into Jack's place,
                  got a couple o' glasses o' the best red-eye—the stuff that never fails—down his
                  neck, and then invited him to take a walk before he was too far gone. Well, we got
                  him down onto the end of the dock, and then we seated him onto the string-piece,
                  and talked pooty to him for about ten or fifteen minits, by the end of which time
                  he was jest as helpless as an infant, and we made as free with his pockets as we
                  pleased. We found two galvanized watches and one gold watch onto him, and a wallet
                  with fifteen dollars and a lot of papers into it, and that was all. I had a good
                  mind to tumble him overboard for allowin' himself to be skinned before we came
                  across him, but I didn't. We took off his boots, and his coat, and his hat, and
                  then laid him out carefully onto the wharf, so's he couldn't roll into the water,
                  and yet I ain't got no doubt that the fellow was ungrateful<pb n="302-303"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000152"/> enough to curse us when he woke up this morning',
                  instead o' thankin' us for all we did for him. I got his wallet and its contents
                  and the two bogus tickers for my share, and let the two others have the gold watch
                  between 'em. I burnt a countryman the first thing this morning with one of the
                  galvanized repeaters, for which I got ten dollars; so on the whole I ain't done so
                  bad. Here's the wallet I got from the old fellow—just look over them bits o' paper
                  and see if any o' them's worth anything;' and he took the article from his pocket
                  and passed it over to Estelle, who proceeded to look over its contents.</p>
               <p>The first paper she opened was a receipted bill of sale for two gold watches, made
                  out in the name of Anthony Butters, and signed C. Hollowell.</p>
               <p>'Did the man you robbed on the dock tell you where he belonged?' asked
                  Estelle.</p>
               <p>'Yes,' replied Dick, 'I think he said he was from New Orleans.'</p>
               <p>'Why, Kate,' exclaimed Estelle, exultingly, 'as sure as you're born it was my old
                  lover, Toney Butters.'</p>
               <p>'Well, that I mayn't sin!' replied Kate, 'bud that's a good wan! Ah, musha! but
                  he's the soft ould chap entirely!'</p>
               <p>'And who do you suppose was the mock auctioneer who fleeced him?' asked
                  Estelle.</p>
               <p>'Mebbe it was Hollowell,' answered Kate, 'for sure it's ourselves that knows he's
                  in the dirty business.'</p>
               <p>'You've guessed it the first time,' said Estelle as she opened the next
                  paper—'let's see—what is this? A receipt for money paid on account—another
                  receipt—a memorandum of receipts and expenditures—a note from his wife cautioning
                  him to keep sober and to shun female society—another receipt, and for pew rent,
                  too, as I'm a sinner—that's all!' and replacing the papers, she closed the wallet
                  and handed it back to Dick.</p>
               <p>'Ain't they worth anything?' asked Dick, in a tone of disappointment.</p>
               <p>'Not to you,' replied Estelle, 'nor to any one else, except Butters himself—not a
                  cent!'</p>
               <p>'Then I might as well burn 'em up all together—wallet and all,' said Dick, as
                  suiting the action to the word he threw the wallet and its contents upon the
                  burning log—'if I should accidentally get pulled,' he continued, 'and stranger
                  things than that have happened, I shouldn't like to have such articles found onto
                  me, for the officers might think I didn't come honestly by them.'</p>
               <p>The three watched the property of the unfortunate Butters in silence till it was
                  entirely consumed, and then Dick Waffles jumped up suddenly, and expressed his
                  determination to 'toddle' as soon as he had taken another drink. Accordingly the
                  bottle was again brought forth, and helping himself freely he swallowed another
                  draught of the poison, deposited a huge quid of tobacco beneath his dexter cheek,
                  buttoned up his coat, and the two miserable women were shortly thereafter again
                  left alone.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
               <p>THE reader will remember that, upon two or three different occasions in the course
                  of this narrative, Emory, when angered at Cantwell, uttered dark threats
                  concerning a murder, and we shall now proceed to state a few particulars which
                  will account for these threats, and at the same time show why Emory, before he
                  resolved to marry Estelle Grant, stepped out of his way to make Helen Wallace the
                  victim of his lust.</p>
               <p>Emory had laid the foundation for the immense fortune which he possessed when
                  first introduced to the reader, in Texas, whither he had emigrated, under the
                  assumed name of Rogers, in early life, to avoid the consequences of a serious
                  difficulty in which he had become involved in New York. It was here that he first
                  made the acquaintance of Cantwell (who then went by the name of William Walker,)
                  and it was here also that he managed to bring about the circumstances which placed
                  that vile being so completely in his power. He had not been in Texas a great while
                  when business threw him into the society of many of the most respectable merchants
                  of the town in which be had located himself, and among these was a young man of
                  the name of Jerome Newman—a generous, open-hearted, unsuspicious individual—the
                  man of all others most apt to fall a victim to the duplicity of so smooth-spoken a
                  man as Emory. Newman was a married man, who, like hundreds of others, had left his
                  wife (he had no children) behind him, and, in a spirit of adventure, and buoyed up
                  with the hope of making a speedy fortune, had sought out that land of promise,
                  concerning which there were at the time so many conflicting statements. The young
                  adventurer was successful beyond his most sanguine expectations—and at the time
                  when he made the acquaintance of Emory, he had realized what might have been
                  considered a competency, and was thinking of settling up his affairs to the end
                  that he might take up his residence permanently in that home in New York which he
                  had for some years only occasionally visited. Happy would it have been for him had
                  he followed out his intentions, but, unfortunately he listened to Emory's specious
                  advice, and the result was fatal to him.</p>
               <p>Newman had had many business transactions with Emory, of minor importance, and, as
                  everything had been conducted fairly and with some profit to both parties, he had
                  not only conceived a strong friendship for the wily hypocrite, but had imbibed the
                  most unbounded faith in his correct judgment and tact in business matters. When,
                  therefore, Emory pointed out to him the absurdity of closing his business with
                  only half a fortune, when a little bold speculation, with him (Emory) as a
                  partner, would render him independently rich in a very short time, he was induced
                  first to listen to, then to reflect upon, and finally to adopt his unprincipled
                  counsellor's suggestions. The result of this injudicious action upon his part was
                  that he soon found his affairs in the most inextricable confusion. He was certain
                  he had lost nothing, and yet, at the expiration of one year after his connection
                  with Emory, the latter's account footed up a loss of some thousands of dollars.
                  This led to words between them, in the course of which Newman's frank and fearless
                  nature impelled him to tax his partner openly with fraud, but when he observed the
                  calm self-possession of the<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6405-00000154"/> man—his
                  look of meek humility and injured innocence—he began to think that he might,
                  perhaps, have suspected him wrongfully, and the matter ended in a reconciliation,
                  although Newman determined to cut himself loose from his engagement as speedily as
                  was convenient. He came to this conclusion too late, however, for in a short time
                  thereafter, he was brought down by a fever, and never left his bed again alive,
                  although it was not the disease which caused his death. When he was first taken
                  sick, Emory hinted to Cantwell (who had for some time been in his employ, and
                  whose character he had thoroughly tested) that, in the event of Newman's demise,
                  he should be in a way to operate as he thought proper, and should consequently be
                  enabled not only to enrich himself, but to give Cantwell a start in the world
                  likewise. The hint was a very distant one, but it was not hard for so acute an
                  individual as Cantwell to understand it perfectly. Accordingly, he manifested the
                  greatest solicitude for the sick man, into whose favor he, too, had managed to
                  ingratiate himself, and offered his services to procure a physician for him who
                  was greatly skilled in the treatment of fevers. His services were accepted
                  gratefully—the physician (a short-necked, bullet-headed, red-nosed,
                  villainous-looking empyric) was brought, and—<emph>the patient died.</emph> After
                  his decease, upon looking into his affairs, it was found that he had conveyed the
                  great bulk of his property to James Rogers (Emory's pseudonym) in liquidation of
                  certain debts contracted from time to time during their acquaintance, leaving only
                  some few hundreds of dollars for his widow, who had, a short time previous to his
                  death, received a letter from him couched in the most discouraging terms. Mrs.
                  Newman had never seen Emory, but she received a letter from him after her sad
                  bereavement, condoling with her in her deep affliction, and passing a glowing
                  eulogium upon the virtues of her deceased husband. She also received a draft for
                  the amount left her, and she never heard of Mr. Rogers afterwards, although he had
                  promised faithfully that he would call upon her and give her the particulars of
                  her husband's death.</p>
               <p>Time passed on, and some three years after the deplorable event just related, Mrs.
                  Newman, still young and attractive, formed the acquaintance of and married a young
                  sea-faring man—a captain in the merchant's service—named Wallace. By this
                  gentlemen she had one child—a daughter—and that child was Helen Wallace. She was
                  but about two years of age, when the unfortunate lady was again left a widow, she
                  having received intelligence of her husband's death at sea by shipwreck.</p>
               <p>Emory returned to New York shortly after Mrs. Newman's union with Capt. Wallace
                  had taken place, and having after some enquiry ascertained the state of her
                  affairs he kept her steadily in view up to the time of attempting the abduction of
                  her daughter, and his motive for making that attempt was to first prostitute the
                  poor girl in the hope that her disgrace would cause her mother to die of grief,
                  and then, Helen being sole heir to the property which he had in so diabolical a
                  manner come into possession of, to magnanimously marry her, thus making his claim
                  to it sure in case Cantwell should at any time prove treacherous. He abandoned
                  this plan, however, almost as soon as he had undertaken it as the reader is
                  already aware, under the idea that it was too risky and involved too great a
                  degree of trouble, and he trusted to the power which he exercised over Cantwell to
                  protect himself against exposure at any time.</p>
               <p>Among other property which Emory inherited by the deed of conveyance which he
                  himself had forged, was real estate in Texas, to the amount of about ten thousand
                  dollars. Knowing that this must greatly improve in value he had not disposed of
                  it, and at the time Cantwell ran away from him it was the biggest item in his
                  possessions. Hardened as was the bold, bad man, he could not bear to look upon the
                  evidences of the blackest deed which he had ever committed, and he had
                     forbidden<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6405-00000155"/> bidden Cantwell ever to
                  even mention Texas in his presence. He had also placed the papers relating to the
                  subject in the tin box mentioned by Dick Waffles while conversing with Estelle and
                  Kate, fully determined in his own mind that he would never look at them as long as
                  he lived if he could possibly help it, but leave them for the benefit of his son
                  after he (Emory) should have terminated his wicked existence.</p>
               <p>Cantwell was aware of this determination on the part of his employer, and although
                  he dared not expose him while living on account of the part which he himself had
                  played in the dark drama, he resolved that the property should never descend to
                  Emory's heirs if he could help it, and accordingly before his flight he gained
                  access to the tin box, and having written a statement of the horrible transaction,
                  he signed the name Wm. Walker to it (the name by which he was known in Texas, for
                  he also went under an assumed name there) enclosed it in the deed, placed the
                  document back as he had found it, closed the box, and fled. These papers were
                  among those which Dick had pilfered, and while Emory supposed them to be perfectly
                  safe they were in the hands of his worst enemy—his wife.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXV.</head>
               <p>ONE morning about a month after the scene which Dick Waffles had witnessed from
                  his hiding place under the sofa between Everard Emory and the youth whom he
                  supposed to be his son, Emory sat at his breakfast-table with the newspaper in his
                  hands, leisurely sipping his coffee and reading a paragraph by turns. He had got
                  through what was to him the most interesting part of the sheet, viz., the
                  commercial department, stocks and money market, and was merely glancing over the
                  general news of the day. He laid down the paper just as he had finished reading
                  the details of a successful exploit performed the day before by a noted
                  pick-pocket in Wall street, who had abstracted a wallet from the side pocket of a
                  gentleman's coat in the presence of a thousand people, and got clear off with his
                  plunder.</p>
               <p>'I wonder,' he said, as he got up from the table and prepared to start out, 'when
                  people will learn to be more cautious! I'd like to see any infernal scoundrel
                  steal my wallet right under my nose, and escape with it! I'd freely forgive him if
                  he did!'</p>
               <p>A look of the severest indignation was visible upon his countenance as he
                  delivered himself of this remark, for<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6405-00000156"/>
                  although a very devil in sin himself, Emory was savagely opposed to vice in
                  others, and he would at any time have used his best exertions to send a poor
                  wretch to the Penitentiary for stealing a loaf of bread.</p>
               <p>'I'd like to see any infernal scoundrel attempt to pick <emph>my</emph> pocket,'
                  he repeated mutteringly, as he sallied forth, and took his way down town—'I don't
                  believe he'd try it again—at least not till he'd served a term in the State
                  Prison! A pretty state of things, truly! A man's wallet twitched from his pocket
                  in broad day-light—the street alive with people, too—and no arrest made! What are
                  we taxed to pay a police force for, I should like to know?'</p>
               <p>And these were the reflections of a man who had himself committed crimes which if
                  fully proved against him, should have consigned him to the gallows!</p>
               <p>He walked briskly along, for there was a cool, bracing air stirring, and by the
                  time he had accomplished half-a-dozen squares his mind was occupied with other
                  subjects than pickpockets. He was turning over in his imagination the many
                  swindling schemes which he had in operation, and speculating as to the termination
                  which they would have in litigation, if it should come to that—he was wondering if
                  it were possible that he could be criminally indicted for his transactions, and if
                  he were, whether a jury of twelve men could be found who would be willing to send
                  a <emph>gentleman</emph> to prison among common felons. Amid communings such as
                  these, he had reached the building in Nassau street in which was his private
                  office, and was just about ascending the steps, when suddenly he felt a quick,
                  sharp twitch at the side pocket of his overcoat, and turning quickly he detected a
                  boy in the act of abstracting his wallet.</p>
               <p>With the rapidity of thought he caught the offender by the collar as he was about
                  making his escape, and at the same time exclaimed, exultingly—</p>
               <p>'Ah, my fine fellow, you've attempted it on <emph>me,</emph> have you? But it
                  wouldn't do—you see I have you safe enough, and if you don't go to the State
                  Prison now, it will be because there is no law in the land! You needn't struggle,'
                  he continued, as the boy—a stout lad—endeavored to break his hold—'you would have
                  to be strong indeed to get away from me!'</p>
               <p>While he spoke he looked around to see if there was a policeman in sight, but
                  presently, as his attention was drawn to the countenance of the boy, who was now
                  pleading hard to be set at liberty, a strange, indefinable sensation came over
                  him, and instantly he changed his intention of giving his prisoner in custody at
                  once, determining first to question him slightly.</p>
               <p>'Let you go, eh?' he exclaimed, in answer to the boy's imploration. 'O yes! I'll
                  be sure to let you go! Come along in here, and let me know who you are, and where
                  you belong,'</p>
               <p>The boy made no opposition, and Emory, leading him into his office, locked the
                  door, and regarding him with a fierce expression, enquired—</p>
               <p>'Now, sir, what's your name? Are you the same accomplished youth who operated upon
                  the pocket of a gentleman so successfully yesterday?'</p>
               <p>'O, no, sir!' whimpered the boy. 'I never attempted sich a thing before in my
                  life, sir—but father's dead, sir—and mother's sick, sir—and sissy's starvin,
                  sir—and that's why I done it, sir!' and a flood of tears ended the boy's pitiful
                  story.</p>
               <p>'You lie!' roared Emory, looking him full in the eye, 'you're an old hand at it.
                  No novice in the business could operate in so finished a manner. What's your name,
                  sir?'</p>
               <p>'My name's Dick Waffles, sir,' answered the boy, (the prisoner was indeed that
                  worthy young gentleman,) still affecting the lachrymose, 'and I never did such a
                  thing before in all my life, sir—and if you don't b'lieve me, sir, come and see
                  mother, sir.'</p>
               <p>At the name of Waffles the same singular sensation which Emory had experienced
                  when he first looked at the boy, again<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6405-00000157"/>
                  came over him, and with some anxiety in his tone, he enquired—</p>
               <p>'Where do you live, sir?'</p>
               <p>'No. 121 —— street, sir,' was the answer.</p>
               <p>Well, you can go,' said Emory at length, after again closely scrutinizing the boy,
                  'and I'll call and see your mother.'</p>
               <p>Dick lost no time in making himself scarce, and after he was gone Emory sat for
                  some moments buried in anxious thought. At length he muttered to himself—</p>
               <p>'I thought old Mother Waffles was dead long since, and yet something tells me that
                  it is she who has reared this boy and led him to suppose that she is his mother!
                  But what is that to me? Why should I care if she had trained a thousand thieves?'
                  After another train of deep thought, he continued, with a sigh, I can't help
                  feeling interested in that boy, for either my imagination must be distempered or
                  he certainly does bear a great resemblance to me! Can it be that any of Jenny
                  Matthews' children could have lived without my knowledge, and been confided to her
                  care? Impossible! And yet, I don't know! I wonder if the young scoundrel gave me
                  his correct address? Nonsense! of course not! What a fool I am to entertain such
                  an idea for a moment! I wish I had detained him, and forced him to lead me to the
                  old woman! But after all, I may be giving myself a great deal of anxiety for
                  nothing. If there is a resemblance between us, it is doubtless the effect of
                  accident, and he may be the son of some Mrs. Waffles whom I have never seen. At
                  all events, I shall give myself no further trouble about it. And thus saying, he
                  turned to his books and was soon immersed in business.</p>
               <p>The day passed wearily with him, however, for he could not entirely shake off the
                  heavy thoughts which oppressed him, and in the afternoon just as he was preparing
                  to proceed homewards, the city express postman put a letter in his hands. He
                  merely glanced at the superscription, the chirography of which was strange to him,
                  and then breaking the seal he was surprised prised to observe that there was
                  neither date nor signature to the missive, which was exceedingly brief, and read
                  as follows <q>
                     <p>"MR. EMORY:—There will be an attempt made to break into your house to-night,
                        so be on the look-out. You may doubt this if you please, but of course there
                        can be no harm in using vigilance, even if the attempt is not made."</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>'Well,' said Emory, as he folded the note up and deposited it in his pocket, 'the
                  thieves in New York seem determined to make a victim of me! In the morning I catch
                  a young villain with his hand in my pocket, and in the evening I am notified that
                  an attempt is to be made upon my house! Hollowell is off, out of town, too, and
                  there will be nobody at home but myself and the wench. Who could this notice have
                  come from? Doubtless from Master Waffles, who, touched with gratitude at my
                  generosity in allowing him to escape, has taken this means to repay me. Had I
                  better notify the police? Let me see—I hardly think that will be worth while, for
                  there can be no danger while I am on my guard, and if this should prove to be a
                  practical joke on the part of some of my good-natured friends—which is not
                  unlikely—they would have the laugh upon me completely should I fill my house with
                  policemen. I guess upon the whole I will let matters take their course, and see
                  what it will all amount to. I can prepare myself to give the house-breaking
                  rascals a warm reception should any indeed pay me a visit, and if the whole affair
                  is a hoax there will be no harm done.' And having arrived at this conclusion,
                  Emory took his way homeward</p>

               <p>WHILE all this was going on, Estelle and Kate O'Donnell sat in the miserable
                  basement which they occupied, nursing the demon wrath, and talking over the
                  destitute condition in which they found themselves.</p>
               <p>'This can't last long, Kate,' said Estelle, and as she spoke, a distressing cough
                  racked her attenuated frame, 'the rent is due to-morrow, and we havn't a cent in
                  the house. What we are to do, I'm sure I don't know. We can't sleep in the
                  streets.'</p>
               <p>'That's thrue for you, misthress dear, answered Kate, dejectedly, 'is there
                  nothing more we cud put up the spout?'</p>
               <p>'Not a thing,' answered Estelle, 'We have pawned everything, even to the
                  miniature.'</p>
               <p>'Maybe the boy 'ud fetch us something,' suggested Kate.</p>
               <p>'Blast him! the heartless imp!' exclaimed Estelle savagely, 'he has never brought
                  us anything yet but bad luck! He is as callous to feeling as a stone—mean, sordid,
                  and despicable—a true son of his father—whatever I get from him is gained by
                  wheedling, coaxing and cajoling, and all the rest have got to be like him—indeed,
                  I believe they have influenced him somewhat—they know that I can be of no further
                  service to them now, and so they leave me to Perish. But my turn may yet come.
                  Kate!' she continued, while a look of malignant frenzy lighted up her sunken eyes,
                  'I would have murdered that boy myself ere now, had I not reserved him for
                  something else!'</p>
               <p>'Whist! here he comes!' cautioned Kate, as Dick Waffles dashed down the basement
                  way and rushed into the room, laughing vociferously.</p>
               <p>'Hush!' said Estelle, 'don't make so much noise, Dick, the people in the house
                  will hear you!'</p>
               <p>'Well, what if they do?' said Dick, somewhat testily—'Aunty, you're allers wipin'
                  a fellow up in the middle of his fun because you're afraid of the people in the
                  house. I've said two or three times, and now I say it agin, d—mdash;n the people
                  in the house!'</p>
               <p>'It's all very well for you to rant and roar like a wild Indian,' replied Estelle,
                  in a severe tone, 'because you've got nothing to lose by it; but if you had the
                  fear of being turned into the street before your eyes, as we have, for inability
                  to pay your rent, you would perhaps be as anxious to act the part of a still
                  tenant as I am. I tell you once for all, Dick, it won't do,' she continued, her
                  anger increasing with each word, 'you've been partly the means of having us turned
                  out of two places already, and now you must learn to conduct yourself differently,
                  or else keep away from us.'</p>
               <p>'I can agree to that last thing easy enough,' said the boy, quite independently,
                  as he arose to his feet and made ready to depart—'I don't see what I've kept
                  hanging around you so long for anyhow—I ain't made anything by it. Every lay
                  you've put me onto has failed, and takin'it altogether I kind'er think you've been
                  the gainer by our 'quaintance.'</p>
               <p>He approached the door to depart, but Kate, who saw that Estelle had gone too far,
                  called him back—</p>
               <p>'Holt on a bit, Dick,' she said soothingly, 'sure, it's ownly funnin' the
                  misthress is—don't be vexed, that's a good filly, bud sit down and have a dhrop o'
                  gin.'</p>
               <pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6405-00000159"/>
               <p>Estelle struggled hard with her passion, but she got the better of it at last, and
                  said in as mild a tone as she could assume—</p>
               <p>'Yes, sit down, Dick, and don't be angry—the fact is, I'm about half crazy
                  thinking what we shall do for a place to put our heads in, and I don't actually
                  know what I'm saying, half the time.'</p>
               <p>This conciliatory speech satisfied the boy, and resuming his seat he said—</p>
               <p>'Well look here, Aunty, I'll tell you what I'll do with you. I know a gallus room
                  I can get for you down town. To be sure the families wot lives in the house ain't
                  quite so airish as them wot lives in this, but what's the use o' livin' where you
                  can't say nothin'? There you can fight, dance, sing, laugh, and break things if
                  you've a mind to, and if you'll move there I'll get the place for you to-morrow.
                  What d'yer say?'</p>
               <p>'Perhaps I can't do better,' replied Estelle, 'so I'll take it.'</p>
               <p>''Nuf said!' replied Dick, 'now then, Kate, fetch along the gin!'</p>
               <p>'Well, thin,' replied that interesting damsel, who had already brought the junk
                  bottle forth from the closet, and was holding it up between herself and the light,
                  'well, thin, the divil a wan dhrap there's in it at all, and me thinkin' it full
                  all the time!'</p>
               <p>'O, me eye!' exclaimed Dick, 'you can't come that over me! You knew it was empty
                  well enough, when you invited me to drink. Here—go and get it filled,' he
                  continued, as he threw her a shilling, 'and when you come back and we take a drink
                  all round, I'll tell you what I was laughing at when I came in.'</p>
               <p>Kate did not wait to deny Dick's accusation concerning the, bottle, but was off
                  like a flash, and soon returned with the poisonous liquid, of which all three
                  immediately partook, and then the hopeful Dick, taking a big chew of tobacco, and
                  throwing one leg over the other, said to Estelle—</p>
               <p>'Now, I'm a goin' to tell you a good joke—that is, I consider it a good joke now,
                  although it might a' turned out a very serious one. This mornin' I was a walkin'
                  along Nassau street, thinkin' about nothin' in partic'lar, 'cos I wasn't on any
                  lay, when all at once my eye fell onto just the edge of a wallet a stickin' out o'
                  the overcoat side pocket of an old gentleman jest ahead o' me. Now you know I
                  don't often attempt that kind o' business 'cos it's out o' my partick'ler line,
                  but the wallet looked so temptin' I couldn't help tetchin the old fellow, so I
                  made a pint for it, but I hadn't no sooner got my fingers onto it than he had me
                  by the collar. I tried the jerk dodge first, to get away, but he hung onto me like
                  a vice, and when I found I couldn't break his hold, I made up my mind to come the
                  innocent dodge over him. So I come one o' my pitiful mugs, but when I turned it up
                  at him, I hope to be shot if I wasn't nearly struck dumb at first to see a
                  countenance what I'd seen before under very pecooliar circumstances. Now who do
                  you think it was?' and as he asked the question he pursed up his mouth as if to
                  say, 'you couldn't tell to save your life.'</p>
               <p>'The divil a wan o' me knows!' said Kate.</p>
               <p>'I can't imagine!' replied Estelle.</p>
               <p>'Nobody else but old Emory!' continued the boy.</p>
               <p>'Indeed!' cried Estelle, over whose face instantly stole an expression of mingled
                  suspicion and fear, 'and how did you get away from him?'</p>
               <p>'O, you needn't be alarmed, Aunty,' replied Dick, in a tone which immediately
                  reassured her, 'I never peach—besides I had no occasion to even if that had been
                  my game, for the moment I told him my name, whatever the reason was, he seemed to
                  soften in a minute, and between you and me, it's my opinion he knows the old
                  woman.'</p>
               <p>'Why, you wasn't foolish enough to give him your right name, was you?' questioned
                  Estelle in some astonishment.</p>
               <pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6405-00000160"/>
               <p>'Of course I was,' answered Dick, 'I allers gives it to anybody that axes for
                  it—and I've got reason to be proud of it, too—I've been pulled half a dozen times
                  and I've never been jugged yet. Every time the jury acquits me, it seems as if
                  every man of 'em stack a knife a-piece into the old Recorder, it hurts him so
                  because he can't have the luxury of sentencing me. 'Well, Richard,' he says every
                  time, same as if he'd knode me from a baby, 'you've escaped again, but we'll have
                  you next time!' 'Walker!' thinks I, as I walks out of the court with flyin'
                  colors, but I don't say anything. Who wouldn't be proud of such a name as Dick
                  Waffles, I'd like to know?'</p>
               <p>'Well, you didn't tell him anything more than that, did you?' questioned
                  Estelle.</p>
               <p>'No,' answered Dick, 'he wanted to know where I lived, and as I couldn't think of
                  any other place just at the time, I gave him old Aunty Cross's number, and if he
                  goes there to enquire for me, the probability is he'll get his head broke before
                  he can reach the street, for the old woman goes crazy at hearin' my name mentioned
                  since I half blowed her head off one night by half fillin' her pipe with powder,
                  and then covering it over with tobacco. O, wouldn't I like to be in one corner and
                  hear Emory ask the old woman if she knew me! I'd risk bein' sent to the State
                  Prison jist to see the way she'd walk into his affections! Ha! ha! that would be
                  better than a play! Ha! ha!' and Dick laughed himself out of breath.</p>
               <p>After his cachinatory fit was over, Estelle remarked carelessly—</p>
               <p>'Speaking of Emory, Dick, Kate has learned this morning from his kitchen wench,
                  whom she met in the grocery, that he is the only man in the house. Hollowell
                  having gone out of town on business.'</p>
               <p>A silence of some moments ensued, when suddenly Dick clapped his hands together
                  and exclaimed, excitedly—</p>
               <p>'By ——! It would be a glorious thing if I could succeed in robbing him to-night
                  after having failed in picking his pocket this morning! I'll try it, if I die for
                  it!'</p>
               <p>'You have not much time to spare then, in which to make your arrangements,'
                  suggested Estelle.</p>
               <p>'That's a fact!' exclaimed Dick, 'so I'll be off at once. I expect to find the
                  boys I want to help me at the house down town which I spoke of, and if you say so
                  I'll engage a room for you to night and you can go in to-morrow.'</p>
               <p>'Very well,' replied Estelle, 'do so. I suppose I shall have to leave here
                  to-morrow whether I like it or not.'</p>
               <p>'Well, then, good bye,' said Dick, and after taking another pull at the gin-bottle
                  he departed.</p>
               <p>'Now then,' said Estelle, with an air of triumph, after he had departed, 'if Emory
                  has him arrested and succeeds in sending him for a term of years to the State
                  Prison, I shall not have labored entirely in vain, but if he should chance to kill
                  him—O, that is too much fortune to hope for—that would indeed be exquisite.'</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVII.</head>
               <p>LET us now return to Emory, whom we left on his way home. He walked along
                  pondering on the strange events of the day, and when about half way home it
                  occurred to him that the street in which Dick had told him he lived was directly
                  in his route, and he determined to stop and ascertain whether the youngster had
                  played him false, or whether he had actually told him the truth regarding his
                  residence. It was anything but a respectable neighborhood to which he had been
                  directed, but Emory combatted the dust, and dirt, and offensive smells which
                  assailed him at every step till at length he came to the number designated by
                  Dick, in front of which he drew up, and began to reconnoitre. It was a miserable,
                  little dilapidated frame-building, with scarcely a whole windowpane in it, and the
                  want of glass was supplied by every imaginable variety of rags, old hats, paper,
                  etc., etc. A sign (evidently of home manufacture) over the door of the first
                  story, informed the passers-by (that is, such as could read it) that Mrs. Bridget
                  Cross kept a wholesale and retail grocery, wine and liquor store. A row of six
                  junk bottles stood in the window, upon the top of every other one of which was
                  placed a lemon of questionable freshness—five or six suspicious-looking kegs were
                  ranged upon a shelf directly behind a shackly counter, upon which stood a
                  filthy-looking pitcher with a piece broken out of the side, half a dozen tumblers,
                  not one of which was whole, and a crazy-looking sugar-bowl—an old ricketty table
                  stood in front of the door, upon which were two heads of wilted cabbage, and a
                  barrel half full of rusty-looking corned pork completed the stock of the
                  establishment—that is, all of it which was visible—what cartloads of provisions
                  and tuns of choice liquors Mrs. Cross might have stowed away in the cellar nobody
                  knew, nor we guess, did anybody care to know. A huge tin sign about in the middle
                  of the house denoted that the upper story was devoted to boarders, and as there
                  must have been at least three rooms on the floor, it is highly probable that the
                  gentlemen choosing that establishment for a stopping-place were numerous, and that
                  a flourishing business in the boarding line was done there.</p>
               <p>As Emory viewed the suspicious-looking abode and hesitated as to whether he should
                  go in or not, he was observed by Mrs. Bridget Cross, the landlady, who at once set
                  him down as a 'murtherin' informer.' She had been forced to pay a fine once for
                  selling liquor without a license, which piece of bad luck she owed to the
                  officiousness of a clerical individual residing in her neighborhood, and this
                  circumstance led her to regard with suspicion every individual habited, as Emory
                  happened to be, in a suit of black with white neckerchief. 'Let him come in,'
                  muttered Mrs. Cross to herself as she watched him from the back of the shop. 'I
                  have me license now, thank God, so let him come in, an' see iv I don't put a flea
                  in his ear!'</p>
               <p>Hardly had she uttered the threat when Emory did venture within the door. He had
                  made up his mind that there could be no harm in his asking a question, so,
                  regarding Mrs. Cross with the haughty, self-sufficient air characteristic of him,
                  he in an awfully severe tone—</p>
               <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6405-00000162"/>
               <p>'Old woman, do you keep this house, or rather, I should say this den?'</p>
               <p>'Din, is it, ye thunderin' ould thief o' the world?' replied Mrs. Cross, whose
                  eyes flashed fire, and the end of whose little pug nose seemed to curl upward with
                  rage. 'Do I kape tho <emph>din?</emph> Fhat would ye give to know, ye conshumin'
                  ould villyan?'</p>
               <p>'Come, come!' exclaimed Emory, threateningly, 'no such language as that to me, or
                  I'll have you in the hands of the police before you know what you're about!'</p>
               <p>'Ye will, eh?' exclaimed Mrs. Cross, triumphantly. 'Do it, ye hoary-headed ould
                  butthermilk beggar! Let's see ye do it! Ye may take the best glass o' the licker
                  in the house (and the worst is too good for the likes o' ye) iv ye'll ownly do it,
                  ye dirthy ould vagabone!'</p>
               <p>Emory now began to see that he had gone the wrong way to work to gain any
                  information. He had thought to frighten the woman at once with a magisterial
                  frown, but failing in that, he knew he could accomplish nothing unless he could
                  manage to allay the old landlady's awakened wrath. He was the more anxious to do
                  this, because he now felt satisfied from the displeasure evinced by the old woman,
                  that she kept a sort of <emph>fence</emph> shop, and having Dick and his mother
                  for boarders was fearful lest he might be after some information calculated to
                  injure her business. So approaching her, he changed his frowning face to a bland
                  expression of countenance, and said in an undertone—</p>
               <p>'It's all right—you needn't be afraid—I know all about it, but I won't say
                  anything.'</p>
               <p>'Won't ye?' exclaimed Mrs. Cross, growing more wrathful than ever—'well, thin,
                  that I mayn't sin, bud that's kind o' ye! d'ye see this?' she continued, as she
                  raised a pail that stood at her side full of dirty slops, 'iv ye ain't out o' this
                  quicker nor a hunted flea hops, I hould ye for a naggin I'll spile yer fine
                  clothes, ye hypocritical ould haythen! Are ye goin' or not?' and she raised the
                  pail which she poised by the handle and the chine at the bottom preparatory to
                  throwing it.</p>
               <p>'I tell you it's all right,' persisted Emory, emphatically—'if you know anything
                  about Dick and his mother you need not keep it from me, for I know more about them
                  perhaps than you do, and I'm a friend of Dick's—if you ask him he'll tell you
                  so.'</p>
               <p>'You don't say so!' sneered Mrs. Cross in a tone of mock surprise, 'an' maybe
                  ye'll tell me what Dick ye'll be maning?'</p>
               <p>'Why Dick Waffles!' said Emory, impatiently, 'you know well enough!'</p>
               <p>'Is it Dick Waffles, the thafe!' almost screamed Mrs. Cross.</p>
               <p>'Why yes, certainly—to be sure it is!' answered Emory.</p>
               <p>'An' are you a frind o' his?' questioned the landlady.</p>
               <p>'Why of course I am,' answered Emory, 'one of the best friends he's got.'</p>
               <p>'Thin take that an' be d——d to ye, for a hang-gallows rash-kill!' shouted Mrs.
                  Cross, and as she spoke, she let Emory have the contents of the dirty slop-pail
                  full in the face. Nor did she stop here, for as he essayed to take forth his
                  handkerchief, with which it was his purpose to wipe the dirty liquid from his
                  eyes, nose, and mouth, she seized a broomstick which stood handy, and uttering a
                  regular Irish war-howl, she advanced to the attack. 'Arrah, musha, big bad luck to
                  the likes o' ye!' she cried, as she proceeded to lay the domestic weapon across
                  his shoulders, and then raising her voice still higher, as her excitement
                  increased with each vigorous blow she struck, she shouted for her body-guard—'Och,
                  Pathrick! Dinnis! Pather!' she yelled, 'sure there's a thafe in the house! a thafe
                  that 'ud sthale your mither's cha-<emph>rac</emph>-ther! So kem and help me bate
                  him!'</p>
               <p>Emory did not wait for a reinforcement to arrive, but beat a hasty retreat, and it
                  was well for him that he did so, for it was not long before three pairs of
                  stalwart arms arrived upon<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6405-00000163"/> the scene of
                  action, and had he not taken himself off as speedily as he did, it is altogether
                  likely that his face as well as his clothes would have been spoiled. His first
                  impulse when he had got so far from the scene of his discomfiture as to consider
                  it safe to stop and reflect, was to have the old woman arrested for the assault,
                  but then he remembered the circumstances which brought the affair about, and
                  thinking that a full examination of the case before a magistrate might lead to an
                  unpleasant cross-examination as far as he himself was concerned, he wisely decided
                  to pocket his injuries, and trust to luck for revenge at some future time. Having
                  come to this conclusion he took his way home dispirited and full of wrath.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</head>
               <p>WHEN Emory reached home after the rough treatment which he had received at the
                  hands of Mrs. Cross, he took his way to his library, and having divested himself
                  of his coat and boots, he drew on his dressing gown and encased his feet in a pair
                  of slippers, after which he drew an easy chair up in front of the grate, in which
                  a bright, cheerful fire was burning, and placing his feet upon the fender, he
                  began to cogitate upon the events of the day.</p>
               <p>I suppose I'm indebted to old Mother Waffles for the mauling which that wild Irish
                  beast gave me,' he muttered; 'no doubt she boards in that den, and expected from
                  what that hopeful youth told her that I would be after her. She owes me a grudge.
                  I suppose, for having withdrawn my patronage from her years ago, and allowed her
                  to go to the devil her own way—but I'll be even with her! I'll have her on the
                  Island again before she's a week older!'</p>
               <p>Having derived some little consolation from this reflection, he arose from his
                  seat and touched a bell pull. The call was soon answered by a black female
                  domestic—the only human being in the house beside himself—who, sticking her woolly
                  head in at the door enquired—</p>
               <p>'Did you ring, sar? Does yer want me?'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' snarled Emory, petulantly, 'come in and shut the door!'</p>
               <p>The servant entered the room, followed by a singular looking little dog—jet black,
                  and so fat as to be scarcely able to waddle—which, unperceived by her, had
                  followed her from the kitchen.</p>
               <p>'How often have I told you,' said Emory, glad to be able to find something upon
                  which to vent his ill-humor, 'to kick that ugly looking cur into the street? Get
                  out!' he continued, as he raised one of his boots and threw it with all his force
                  at the unfortunate animal, which, shivering with fright, was crouching at the feet
                  of its mistress. The heel of the boot took effect upon the head of the poor brute,
                  which gave expression to its pain by a series of violent yelps.</p>
               <p>'Oh, don't hurt the dog, massa Emory,' pleaded the black woman, as she stood
                  before her pet to shield him from a second assault threatened by Emory, and then
                  adroitly opened the door, and allowed the abused quadruped to make his escape.</p>
               <p>'I see how it is,' growled Emory, wrathfully, 'I'll have to serve that dog as I
                  served your spiteful-looking cat which was<pb n="326-327"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000164"/> so fond of staring at me with its great
                  impudent-looking eyes—cover it with camphene and then set it on fire! Nothing like
                  that for ridding the house of such pests! What do you want such a scurvy looking
                  brute around you for, eh?'</p>
               <p>'Why, Massa Emory,' expostulated the wench, 'Joe amn't scurvy—Joe one ob de
                  cleanest dogs in de 'varsal world! an' I keep him 'round me case I like him—and de
                  reason dat I like him am case he like me.'</p>
               <p>'Bah!' exclaimed Emory, in a tone of disgust, 'well, don't you let me catch him in
                  this room again, or I'll roast him alive—mind that! Has any one been here to
                  day?'</p>
               <p>'No sah,' answered the wench.</p>
               <p>'Have you seen any suspicious looking characters prowling around the house?' asked
                  Emory.</p>
               <p>'No, sar—ain't seed nobody 'tall,' answered the wench in a somewhat sulky tone,
                  'I'se bin bissy in de kitchen all day iernin.'</p>
               <p>'Well, get out!' snarled Emory, 'I don't want you any longer!'</p>
               <p>Without replying, the wench vanished immediately, and at the foot of the first
                  flight of stairs, she encountered her canine friend who lay there waiting for her,
                  and who wagged his tail and licked her hand joyfully as she stooped down to pat
                  his head—'Poor Joe!' she exclaimed, in a tone full of sympathy, 'Put de kamphean
                  on <emph>you,</emph> eh, honey? Let him do it if he dars! Jes' let him do it once,
                  dat's all!' and she took her way to the kitchen closely followed by Joe, who
                  whined in answer to her expressions of condolence as though he understood every
                  word which she was saying.</p>
               <p>Ater she had gone, Emory arose from his seat and approaching a pistol case which
                  stood upon the mantel-piece he opened it and drew forth a pair of duelling
                  pistols—these he carefully examined, and then apparently well satisfied with his
                  scrutiny he placed them back again, observing as he did so, 'all right! I have
                  never known them to miss fire yet, and it will be singular if there is not at
                  least one burglar less in the world to-night if I should change to be molested, an
                  event the occurrence of which I begin very much to doubt.'</p>
               <p>Taking up the first book which came to hand, he read till summoned to tea by the
                  black woman. After swallowing a cup of the beverage he gave the old negress
                  particular instructions to be careful about locking all the doors, and charged her
                  on no account to admit anybody during his absence, and then lighting a cigar, he
                  salled forth and took his way towards a fashionable gambling hell which he was in
                  the habit occasionally of visiting. Having reached there he attempted to enter
                  into the game, but it had lost its usual attractions for him, for his mind was ill
                  at ease notwithstanding his strenuous efforts to drive the subject of the
                  threatened burglary from his mind, and at about ten o'clock he returned home, and
                  entering his library, he seated himself at his writing desk and began penning a
                  letter of instructions to Hollowell, concerning some swindling transaction in
                  which they were engaged.</p>
               <p>The sky had threatened a storm all the evening, and as Emory settled himself to
                  his task, a fine sleet mingled with hail and snow came pattering against the
                  window-panes, driven by a violent wind which seemed to increase in fierceness with
                  each blast, till at length it whistled furiously through every vent-hole and
                  seemed to shake the building to its foundation in its mad fury.</p>
               <p>While Emory wrote, he would pause occasionally, and listen intently as a violent
                  gust would rattle the closed shutters of the rooms below, and once or twice he
                  took the lamp in his hand and went down stairs to satisfy himself that everything
                  was right. At length he finished his letter, and having folded, sealed, and
                  superscribed it, he threw it upon the desk, and drawing himself up in front of the
                  fire he disposed himself to listen. As he did so the clock struck the hour of
                  twelve.</p>
               <p>'Twelve o'clock,' he muttered, 'and if my thieving friends intend to pay me a
                  visit to-night, they will soon be here.<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6405-00000165"/>
                  Whew!' he continued, as the wind, in its tornado-like fury, rushed along under the
                  eaves of the house, howling like a thousand spirits of evil in concert, 'this is a
                  splended night for their operations, but not a very agreeable one for a promenade.
                  Let me see—I don't believe they'll venture to approach if they see a light
                  burning, and as I am somewhat anxious to know if any attempt is really intended or
                  not, I think I'll just take my barkers upon my lap, extinguish the light, and
                  remain quiet awhile.'</p>
               <p>He did so, and nearly an hour passed by before anything occurred to excite his
                  attention, when just as he was about falling into a doze, he was startled by a
                  slight noise, proceeding apparently from the basement.</p>
               <p>Taking a pistol in each hand, he arose from his seat, and noiselessly opening the
                  door of the room which he was in, he groped his way cautiously along the entry
                  till he reached the stairs, and then proceeded on tip-toe towards the
                  basementdoor, just before reaching which he stumbled against something which had
                  been left in the way, and came near falling. He recovered himself, however, and
                  paused within a few feet of the door to listen. At first, he heard nothing, and
                  began to think that his imagination might have led him astray, when a sound, as of
                  suppressed whispering, caught his ear, and he edged nearer towards the door and
                  laid his ear against it.</p>
               <p>'I tell you I heard something,' whispered a voice.</p>
               <p>'O, the devil's grandmother!' whispered another in response. 'You're allers a
                  hearin somethin'! You heard a cat jump, I s'pose. Keep on usin' your brace and
                  bit, Alec: get a few holes inter this pannel and we can soon shove it through; and
                  if we don't make free with the old feller's plate then, it'll be our fault.'</p>
               <p>'If you get possession of any property of mine,' thought Emory, as he levelled the
                  pistol in the right hand as nearly as he could guess, directly at the spot from
                  whence the whispering proceeded, 'you must find it in h—ll!' and as the impious
                  thought passed through his mind, he fixed both his pistols in quick succession. A
                  deep groan, and an exclamation of 'By ——! Dick's shot!' followed the last report,
                  and instantly the robbers fled, bearing their wounded companion with them.</p>
               <p>'Ha! ha!' chuckled Emory, as he groped his way up stairs, 'you'll make free with
                  the old fellow's plate, will you? I hope carrying it won't tire you! Ha! ha! Then
                  I was correctly informed, after all. I hope I shot two of them! I trust there was
                  no ammunition wasted!' and amid such exclamations as these, he reached his library
                  and struck a light, after which he proceeded to the room occupied by the black
                  housekeeper, for the purpose of arousing her; but Joe, her canine pet, who shared
                  her apartment, had saved him that trouble, and he found her just about descending
                  to learn the cause of the noise.</p>
               <p>'Bress de Lord, Massa Emory!' she exclaimed with a look of terror, as she regarded
                  the stern-browed man, 'wot de matter, eh? Who bin firin' de pistils dis time o'
                  night?'</p>
               <p>'None of your business!' was the quick and angry reply. 'I want you to post
                  yourself down in the basement, and stay there till daylight, and if you hear
                  anything stirring around the house, call me, d'you hear?'</p>
               <p>'Yes, massa,' answered the negress, now dreadfully frightened, 'but—'</p>
               <p>'I don't want any buts!' exclaimed Emory, wrathfully, 'go and do as I tell you, or
                  else bundle out of the house at once! It's a fine night for exercise outside, and
                  perhaps you'd rather walk about the streets than sit by a good fire. Come, move!
                  Do one or the other.'</p>
               <p>'Yes, massa, I'se a-gwine,' said the poor creature, as she tremblingly descended
                  the stairs.</p>
               <p>'And turn that whelp into the street!' exclaimed the heartless man, as Joe, who
                  had flew down the stairs as soon as he caught sight of Emory, set up a loud
                  barking for his mistress.</p>
               <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6405-00000166"/>
               <p>'Can't turn Joe out in de street sich a night as dis!' expostulated the poor
                  woman, 'he freeze to def!'</p>
               <p>'Well, so much the better,' exclaimed Emory, passionately, 'let him freeze to
                  death! Do you think I am to be kept awake by his infernal barking?'</p>
               <p>'Joe keep still soon's I get down dar 'long wid him,' said the woman.</p>
               <p>'Do you stop to bandy words with me, you black devil!' cried Emory, furiously.
                  'Either turn that cur out, or else clear out yourself and take him with you!'</p>
               <p>'Well, de Lord nose,' said the poor creature, as the tears sprang into her eyes,
                  'it am a mighty hard matter for poor colored woman like me to git 'long in de
                  world widout no home, an' I doesn't know what I shill de wiv myself to-night out
                  in de storm, but if poor Joe goes, I must go 'long wiv him. Joe's de o'ny friend
                  I'se got in de wide world, and 'long as he lives I'll stick by him; if I die for
                  it. So if you'll let me git my little bundel ob close, I'll go!'</p>
               <p>'Just like a nigger!' snarled Emory, petulantly; 'one can never get them to do as
                  one wishes!' He did not wish to lose the services of the woman just at that
                  particular moment, however, and thought it best to let her have her own way; so he
                  continued, 'Well, you may keep the dog, but mind you if he awakens me with his
                  cursed noise, I'll go down and roast him before your eyes!' and having delivered
                  himself of this heartless threat, he went to bed very well satisfied with his
                  night's work.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIX.</head>
               <p>OF all places in the world the pawnbroker's shop is the most gloomy, for it is the
                  grave of buried hopes, the scene of blighted prospects, the last resort of the
                  heart-crushed but honest artizan and the sorrowing needle-woman, as well as of the
                  profligate spendthrift and the abandoned prostitute.</p>
               <p>In the pawnbroker's shop is never to be found a 'beggarly account of empty boxes,'
                  for the dust-covered pigeon-holes which stretch the whole length of the room
                  behind the counter of the sombre-looking and musty smelling apartment, are
                  literally crammed with parcels each one of which contains a lamentable history of
                  its own. It has been often said that it 'takes all sorts of characters to make a
                  world,' and it may with equal truth be said that it 'takes all sorts of property
                  to make a pawnbroker's shop.' In it may be found the rich dress of the flaunting
                  frail one and the more humble habiliment of the needy sempstress—the starving
                  mechanic's toolbox and the gambler's flashy wardrobe—the widow's wedding-ring and
                  the failing courtezan's jewels—the poor student's most valued volume and the
                  unfortunate drunkard's last shirt—trinkets held sacred as parting gifts—mementoes
                  of the dead which nothing but the terrible fear of starvation<pb n="332-333"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000167"/> could have induced their owners to relinquish if
                  only for an hour—miniatures of deceased friends—husbands, lovers, brothers,
                  fathers, mothers, wives, sweethearts or sisters—the implements of every imaginable
                  trade and calling—wearing apparel of every description, even to an actor's
                  wardrobe—in short, every thing that constitutes property, from a tooth-pick to a
                  steam engine—from a baby's rattle to a full-jewelled watch—from a child's pinafore
                  to a thousand dollar shawl.</p>
               <p>We believe that a pawnbroker—that is, a thorough-going, enthusiastic
                  pawnbroker—must be fitted by nature for his business—for no amount of practice—no
                  length of time—could fit an ordinary man to witness, day after day, what the
                  pawnbroker witnesses, and live through it. And the reason of this is not, perhaps,
                  because the pawnbroker is destitute of feeling, but because he does not stop to
                  think—it is not his business to think, but to loan money at an exorbitant rate of
                  interest, upon the various articles offered. A pale, emaciated, sickly-looking
                  woman, scantily clothed, enters the shop, and tremblingly offers for the monied
                  man's inspection a small gold locket. She has visited him often before—he has in
                  his possession various articles belonging to her, which she has parted with for
                  less than half their value, and he feels sure she will never redeem them—her bosom
                  throbs tumultuously, and the scalding tears chase each other down her wan cheeks
                  as she parts with the locket but he cannot see these evidences of <q>
                     <l>'The heart bowed down with weight of woe—'</l>
                  </q> not he—he can only see in her a good customer—so he deposits the locket upon
                  a shelf, the starving creature departs, and he is ready for the next customer.</p>
               <p>Now, to an ordinary man such an incident would furnish matter for painful
                  reflection. In the case of the woman mentioned he might perhaps in imagination
                  follow her to her wretched abode—a miserable attic room, or perhaps a damp and
                  ill-ventilated cellar—where two or three fatherless and famishing children
                  awaited, with painful anxiety, her return— he might picture to himself the scene
                  which immediately followed her appearance among them. How they eagerly flew at the
                  loaf of bread which she had purchased while on her way home, and tearing it to
                  pieces proceeded voraciously to devour it, while she looked on with streaming eyes
                  and a heart full of agony. How she sighed to think that she had parted with the
                  last article of value she possessed in the world—an article, too, as dear to her
                  almost as life itself—and how she trembled at the reflection that when the money
                  she had obtained upon it was gone, her little ones must starve unless she received
                  aid from some quarter—how she distractedly paced up and down her wretched
                  apartment, and thought of destroying herself and them—and then, as the terrible
                  wickedness of such a thought flashed athwart her excited mind, how she dropped
                  upon her knees, and raising her eyes to Heaven, ejaculated, 'How long, O, God! how
                  long!'</p>
               <p>One morning shortly after the events detailed in the previous chapter, a
                  well-dressed, middle-aged gentleman was proceeding leisurely up Chatham street,
                  looking around him upon every side with the curiosity natural to a stranger, when
                  suddenly an article in the window of a pawnbroker's shop arrested his attention,
                  and drawing himself up in front of it, he scrutinized it carefully for a while,
                  and then entered the shop. It was quite early in the morning, and the patrons of
                  the establishment had not yet began to make their appearance.</p>
               <p>Walking up to the Counter, the gentleman, in a bland, affable tone of voice,
                  enquired if the lady's miniature in the window was on sale?</p>
               <p>'Well, the time ain't run out yet,' was the answer, 'but I s'pose I can sell it,
                  for I don't believe it will ever be called for—the person that left it never does
                  call for anything she leaves, and if she did call for it and it was gone I don't
                  s'pose she'd make much fuss about it.'</p>
               <p>'Did the original of the picture herself leave it here?' questioned the gentleman
                  with some anxiety.</p>
               <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6405-00000168"/>
               <p>'O, no,' was the answer, 'the <emph>original</emph> of it is sick, and a companion
                  of her's—an Irish girl—left it here.'</p>
               <p>'Can you tell me where she lives?' asked the gentleman.</p>
               <p>'Yes,' answered the pawnbroker, 'I ain't exactly satisfied about some of the
                  articles the girl has left here, and I took down her address for fear of
                  accidents. Here it is,' he continued, as he scratched it upon a piece of paper and
                  handed it to the gentleman, who after some further talk struck a bargain for the
                  miniature, which the pawnbroker took from the window and was about handing over,
                  when another individual who had been looking at it from the outside, entered the
                  shop, just as the gentleman first mentioned was about depositing the article in
                  his pocket.</p>
               <p>'May I make so bold as to ask,' said the new comer addressing the possessor of the
                  picture, 'whether you are related to the original of that miniature?'</p>
               <p>'First let me enquire,' returned the gentleman, 'your motive for asking the
                  question?'</p>
               <p>'I cannot explain my motive,' was the reply, 'till you have answered my
                  interrogatory. Everything depends upon that. If you are the lady's husband, or
                  brother, I have no explanation to make—if, on the contrary, you are not related to
                  her by ties of blood, then I think I have the best right to her likeness.'</p>
               <p>'That may of may not be,' answered the gentleman, determinedly—'I cannot tell what
                  your claims upon the lady may be, but I know I have been acquainted with her from
                  childhood, and feel a great interest in her welfare. I also know that she is sick
                  and destitute, and I shall keep her portrait, which I have redeemed, till I see
                  her—if she is then satisfied that you should have it I have no objection. May I
                  enquire your name and the nature of your claims upon the lady?'</p>
               <p>'O, yes,' was the answer, 'my name is Camp, Francis Camp, of New Orleans, and the
                  lady is indebted to me for sums loaned to a considerable amount. And now having
                  satisfied you perhaps I may ask your name?'</p>
               <p>'Certainly,' answered the gentleman, with affability, 'my name is Philip Tieman,
                  merchant, pf St. Louis. But come,' he continued suddenly, and with energy, 'the
                  object of our solicitude is in great distress, and even while we are talking here
                  she may be dying. I have her address—let us wait upon her.'</p>
               <p>'With all my heart!' exclaimed Camp, and leaving the shop, they took their way
                  towards Mulberry street.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XL.</head>
               <p>WE have now reached that point in our story where we left Estelle (for she it was)
                  lying upon a sick bed in a wretched hovel—the abode which Dick Waffles had secured
                  for her on the night of his last rash adventure. It was about a week after the
                  attempted burglary, that Harry —— was led to her bedside by Fred Fox, the
                  policeman, and after the sudden flight of Kate O'Donnell and the departure of
                  Fred, at Harry's request, the latter stood gazing upon the face of the sick woman,
                  seemingly uncertain as to whether he was awake or dreaming. He could scarcely
                  credit that the emaciated, wrinkled, miserable creature before him was the same
                  being whom he had years before known as the bright and beautiful Estelle Grant,
                  while she, on her part, seemed to shrink within herself as she met his look of
                  mingled grief and astonishment. She would rather have met any man in the world
                  than him,<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6405-00000169"/> for shame was not entirely
                  dead within her, and abject as she was she remembered that she was once guileless
                  and innocent, and that he had known and loved her at such a time.</p>
               <p>The fit of abstraction into which Harry had fallen as he looked at her, was at
                  length broken by Estelle, who, turning her glassy eyes full upon him,
                  remarked—</p>
               <p>'You are the only man in the world whose presence could have awakened such
                  feelings within me as I have for a few moments past experienced, and had I not
                  heard years ago that you were dead, it is not likely that we should now have
                  met—however, as we have met, this is no time for vain regrets or useless
                  sensitiveness—so I will stifle all such feelings, and come at once to the
                  statement which I wish to make.'</p>
               <p>She paused to take breath, when Harry, in a tone of wonderment, remarked,
                  apparently more to himself than to her—</p>
               <p>'How is it possible that a lady of taste, refinement, and noble qualities, could
                  fall from her high estate so low as this?'</p>
               <p>'How is it possible?' answered Estelle, her eyes sparkling with the fire of anger
                  as she spoke; 'have you lived till your time of life to seriously ask such a
                  question as that? There was a time when I could have asked that question, and
                  sought in my own mind in vain for a reply—but there is no mystery about it
                     <emph>now</emph>—it is as plain as the noonday sun. How is it possible?' she
                  repeated, with energy, 'ask of the seared heart, once pure, unspotted and
                  joyous—possessing the wealth of innocence and contentment—the heart that, once
                  young and fresh, was sold for gold, and by the damning blight of that accursed
                  sale was rendered obdurate and hard—the heart whose dearest affections were by
                  fraud and treachery taken from the youth to whom they were freely given, and
                  transferred to the keeping of a human tiger, making prostitution of what should
                  have been marriage, and hell of what should have been a heaven! Or take a walk
                  among the daughters of toil, and ask the question of the suffering heart which
                  hopes against hope. Ask the bright-eyed and rosy-cheeked maiden who strives
                  honestly to get a living by toiling late and early, why her cheeks grow pale and
                  her eyes lose their lustre—and when she finds, in spite of all her exertions to
                  preserve an honest name, that men with heaps of wealth, but no brains and less
                  humanity, consider her morals loose because she is a working girl—when she finds
                  that they condemn in her the very thing which they should most admire—ask her why
                  her ideas of virtue alter, and her heart loses its purity! How is it possible?
                  Man's inhumanity makes it possible!'</p>
               <p>The wretched creature ceased to speak on account of exhaustion, and as she lay
                  panting for breath, Harry took occasion to caution her in a kindly tone against
                  giving way to her feelings.</p>
               <p>'O, it will be all the same in a few hours hence,' she said, when she had so far
                  recovered as to be able to speak—'I have not long to stay here, and I may as well
                  make the best use of my time. By this hour to-morrow I shall be cheek by jow! with
                  Satan!' and she uttered a laugh which made the blood curdle in the veins of her
                  listener, who in the hope of changing the dark current of her thoughts,
                  remarked—</p>
               <p>'Do not indulge in such horrible conceits, my dear madam, but let your mind dwell
                  upon the mercy instead of the wrath of Deity. It is never too late to repent.'</p>
               <p>'Repent!' exclaimed the sick woman, in a tone of surprise, 'who said anything
                  about repenting? I have no desire to repent. I feel satisfied that even hell must
                  be preferable to this earth, and I am not afraid to go there. The Devil was at my
                  bedside all night last night, and the bargain between us is concluded. I assure
                  you that he is not such a bad sort of person after all, when compared with a
                  certain individual whom I could name Do you know Everard Emory?' she ended
                  abruptly.</p>
               <p>'I have no personal acquaintance with him,' answered Harry, 'but I know his
                  history pretty well since his marriage with you. He lives in this city now.'</p>
               <pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6405-00000170"/>
               <p>'I am aware of the fact,' remarked Estelle, quietly.</p>
               <p>'And does he know what an awful situation you are in?' enquired Harry.</p>
               <p>'No,' was the reply, 'he does not know at present whether I am living or dead; but
                  he shall know soon. I have a surprise for him. And now,' she continued, 'before I
                  proceed to give you the incidents of my life, have the kindness to take the key
                  which you will find beneath my pillow and open yonder trunk. You will find in the
                  right-hand corner writing materials, together with a sealed packet. This last I
                  wish you would direct to Mrs. —— Wallace, who lives in the town of ———, State of
                  Connecticut, and if you would oblige me so much I wish you would take it to the
                  Post-office at once.'</p>
               <p>'But it would not be right to leave you alone,' said Harry, 'you might die in my
                  absence for want of assistance.'</p>
               <p>'There is no danger,' was the confident reply of Estelle, 'I have been left alone
                  for hours together since I was first taken so ill, and you will be gone at most
                  but a few minutes—besides, I need rest, for talking has somewhat fatigued me.'</p>
               <p>Re-assured by the confident manner in which she spoke Harry superscribed the
                  packet as requested, and started with it to the Post-office. He was not gone long,
                  and when he returned he was gratified to find the patient much stronger than when
                  he left her.</p>
               <p>'Now,' she said, 'I have one more request to make; please write a note to Emory
                  stating that I am on my death-bed, and add that I have some revealments to make
                  which are of vital importance to him. This you can safely send, as it is of no
                  value, by any one of the ragged children who are playing in the court. A promise
                  of sixpence will secure the services of any of them.'</p>
               <p>This request was also complied with, and then Estelle, stopping at intervals, to
                  regain strength, related to her eager listener without reservation, every incident
                  of her eventful life.</p>
               <p>The shades of night were gathering fast when she had finished ished the narration,
                  and Harry, at her request, lighted the remains of a candle which was sticking in a
                  bottle standing upon a stool. He then thought it time to take his departure, and
                  turning to Estelle, he said—</p>
               <p>'I shall have to leave you now, but it is not right that you should remain alone,
                  and I will send somebody to stay by you during the night.'</p>
               <p>'That will be useless,' she replied feebly, 'I have not many hours longer to stay
                  on earth, but I shall not die till I see <emph>him</emph>—I am confident of that!
                  He must be here before a great while, and I wish you could be present at our
                  interview. He is a violent man when his passion is aroused, and he might kill me
                  before I finish what I have to say to him.'</p>
               <p>Harry was about to reply when the door opened, and Philip Tieman and Frank Camp
                  entered the apartment, and walking up to the invalid's bed both gazed fixedly at
                  her for some moments without speaking.</p>
               <p>The, young man knew not what to make of this abrupt intrusion on the part of the
                  strangers, and he was about to question them when his attention was arrested by
                  the expression of mingled surprise and mortification which rested upon the
                  features of Estelle as she gazed at and finally evidently recognized them.</p>
               <p>'I wonder who else of my acquaintances of bye-gone days will visit me,' she said
                  at length, an air of reckless hardihood taking the place of the painful surprise
                  which she had at first manifested, 'before it will please Death to release my soul
                  from this detestable prison-house of clay! Have you brought any of your rich
                  relatives, Philip Tieman, or your exclusive and fastidious St. Louis friends to
                  witness this last scene in a life drama? If so, show them in at once. This is a
                  glorious reception room! One fit for a Queen to enter! And rare guests are
                  present, too! Unseen, perhaps, but still present! and among them are two crowned
                  heads—King Death and<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6405-00000171"/> King Belzebub!'
                  and a smile, of extreme bitterness rested upon her corpse-like features.</p>
               <p>The person addressed, closing his eyes as if to shut out the piteous spectacle,
                  shuddered perceptibly and could only ejaculate—'Can this be real?'</p>
               <p>'And you, Frank Camp,' continued the dying woman, turning her eyes with a look of
                  scorn upon that individual, 'have you come in the hope of recovering the amount of
                  my indebtedness to you? Ha! ha! I can't pay you in cash, but I will make you my
                  heir! I will leave you sole possessor of all this magnificent furniture! Or if
                  that will not do, I will now redeem the promise which I made and elope with you!
                  Bring your carriage!—I am ready! Here are rare charms for you!' and raising her
                  skinny arms she held them towards him and laughed derisively.</p>
               <p>'This is too horrible!' said Camp, as he shudderingly gazed upon the unearthly
                  features of Estelle; and then without addressing a word to her, he turned upon his
                  heel and left the apartment.</p>
               <p>'Can I do anything for you, Estelle?' asked Philip Tieman, as he advanced a step
                  nearer and bent over the invalid.</p>
               <p>'Yes,' she answered promptly, 'you can do me a very great favor'—then looking
                  spitefully at him, she continued, 'begone, instantly, and do not torture me longer
                  with your unwelcome presence!'</p>
               <p>He was about to offer a remark in the way of expostulation, but she would not
                  listen to him—</p>
               <p>'Begone!' she cried, 'if you would not have me curse you! Reply is unnecessary!
                  Leave me!'</p>
               <p>And perceiving that any attempt to reason with the frail creature would be
                  useless, Philip Tieman took his departure and Estelle and Hary were once more left
                  alone.</p>
               <p>A whole day in the miserable abode had sickened Harry, and he was anxious to get
                  away, but at Estelle's urgent request he decided to wait awhile, and had just told
                  her so when a heavy footstep was heard in the paved court outside, and the next
                  moment a knock was heard at the door</p>
               <p>'Come in!' cried Harry, when the door slowly opened, and Emory, peering
                  suspiciously around the gloomy apartment, entered. He was afraid when he received
                  the note that some treachery was intended, but every doubt vanished when he
                  observed that his wife was really lying at death's door, and that nobody save
                  Harry, (whom he knew from report to be a reputable man) was present.</p>
               <p>Approaching the bed of the sick woman, a sardonic grin overspread his face as he
                  remarked, in a tone of savage joy which he found it impossible to conceal—</p>
               <p>So, madam, you have sent for me to seek my forgiveness for the many wrongs which
                  you have heaped upon me, eh? There is nothing like a death-bed to bring such
                  malicious jades as you to their senses! Come, what have you got to say that
                  concerns me? Out with it quick, if it's anything of importance, or the devil will
                  claim his own before you have an opportunity of unburthening yourself.'</p>
               <p>'Feelingless man!' interposed Harry, stepping forwad, 'do not torture an already
                  dying woman—if you can do nothing but upbraid her, listen in silence to what she
                  has to say.'</p>
               <p>'And who are you,' asked Emory, sneeringly, 'that you presume to dictate to an
                  injured husband the course which he should pursue with a guilty wife? Begone, sir!
                  We can get along here without your company!'</p>
               <p>'Mrs. Emory,' replied Harry, 'has requested me to stay, and until she withdraws
                  that request I shall, do so.'</p>
               <p>'I have a confession to make,' said Estelle, in a tremulous tone, 'and it is my
                  wish that Mr. —— should hear it.'</p>
               <p>'Then, if he must stay, let Mr. —— hold his peace, 'growled Emory, 'till he is
                  spoken to.'</p>
               <p>'Emory,' said Estelle, in a tone of assumed calmness, and a look of devilish
                  malice sparkled in her dying eye as she spoke, although her tone was that of
                  supplication, 'my principal<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6405-00000172"/> pal reason
                  in sending for you in this, my dying hour, was to speak of our child. I do not
                  wish him to curse my memory after I shall have passed away, and all I ask is, that
                  when I am gone, you will when you allude to me in speaking with him, mention me in
                  kindness. Will you do this?'</p>
               <p>'Madam,' replied Emory, haughtily, 'I know you never intended that my son should
                  be bred a gentleman, but in spite of all your scheming, I feel happy to say that
                  such will be his breeding. As for you, I have lost no opportunity to impress upon
                  his young mind the vileness of your character. To magnify your crimes would be
                  impossible, but I have tried hard, and I think I have succeeded, in giving him a
                  very fair idea of the nature of the foul wretch who bore him. I own that my
                  endeavors have not produced exactly the effect upon him which I could wish they
                  would, but I trust I shall be enabled before I die to learn him to cordially hate
                  you!'</p>
               <p>A laugh wild and unearthly, and uttered so suddenly as to cause Emory to start
                  back in affright, burst from the lips of Estelle. It ended in a deep groan, and
                  then speaking with difficulty, she said derisively—</p>
               <p>'So you won't speak a good word for me to our boy, eh? Well, then, I shall have to
                  speak for myself. I shall see him before you do!'</p>
               <p>'Come, come,' said Emory, impatiently, 'if you have any confession to make, be
                  about it quickly, for I see that your mind is wandering, and you will be a
                  grinning lunatic before long.'</p>
               <p>'My mind is not wandering,' answered Estelle, with wonderful calmness, 'it is as
                  comprehensive and unclouded now as it was the cursed day when I first called you
                  husband, and I tell you that I will see our boy first!'</p>
               <p>'And where will you see him?' enquired Emory, laughing derisively.</p>
               <p>'<emph>In hell!</emph>' yelled Estelle, raising herself upon one elbow, and
                  glaring savagely upon Emory—'think me not insane, for right well do I know what I
                  utter, and who is listening to me; and again I say, I shall see our boy in Tophet,
                  where you have sent him, and where he is waiting for me! You are fearful that I
                  will die before I can make a confession. I begin to fear it too, for already I
                  feel death's icy hand upon me—so I will be brief. In the first place, then, the
                  boy whose heart you have been so anxious to fill with hatred for his mother, and
                  with whose education you have been so particular, is not our son!'</p>
               <p>'Whose son is he then?' asked Emory, with nervous agitation.</p>
               <p>'He is the son of my lover, James Ely!' shouted Estelle exultingly, and our son
                  is——'</p>
               <p>She paused, and Emory, upon whose mind a light began to break, seized her tightly
                  by the wrist, and hissed between his set teeth—</p>
               <p>'And our son is whom?'</p>
               <p>'Dick Waffles the thief!' yelled Estelle, breaking into an hysteric laugh which
                  ended in a swoon, and she fell back upon the bed just as Emory was about to
                  strangle her.</p>
               <p>'Touch her not!' shouted Harry, seizing tightly hold of Emory—'would you maltreat
                  a corpse? See, she is dead!'</p>
               <p>Emory's whole frame was convulsed with agony, and sinking into a chair, he buried
                  his face in his hand, and remained silent, tapping the floor the while nervously
                  with the toe of his boot. Harry sprang to the assistance of Estelle, and raising
                  her head, he bathed her temples and nostrils with some spirits of camphor, a small
                  phial containing which he had found upon the mantel-piece.</p>
               <p>'It is not over yet!' he said, in a subdued tone, as he observed signs of
                  returning animation, 'she revives!'</p>
               <p>Jumping quickly from his apathetic posture, Emory approached the bed, and gazing
                  imploringly upon his wife, ha exclaimed—</p>
               <p>'O, Estelle! wife! If you possess consciousness, unsay the<pb n="344-345"
                     xml:id="VAC6405-00000173"/> horrible speech to which you have just given
                  utterance, and I will bless instead of cursing you! I will forgive you
                  all—everything—and I will teach our boy to love and respect you! It is not so, is
                  it? Do not die with a lie upon your lips!'</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>You</emph> will forgive <emph>me!</emph>' gasped Estelle, faintly, when she
                  was able to articulate. 'I suppose, then, I have received no wrongs at your hands,
                  for which you should ask <emph>my</emph> forgiveness! But let that pass: I have
                  not finished my confession yet, and I must do so while I have time. If you wish to
                  see your well-bred and gentlemanly son before you die, keep close watch of the
                  Coroner's reports in the daily papers, and probably you will read that the body of
                  a boy about sixteen years of age—a thief well known to the police—was found
                  floating in the dock, with a bullet-hole in his breast. There will be nobody
                  present at the inquest to tell who shot him, or how he got in the water, but I
                  will tell you. He was engaged with others in attempting to force an entrance into
                  his father's house, but his father having been previously notified that such an
                  attempt would be made, prepared himself to meet it, and in his thirst for blood he
                  shot his own son through the body. His companions bore the wounded boy to their
                  vile abode, and there, amid horrible oaths and execrations, he died, cursing the
                  hand that inflicted the wound, and his body was finally thrown by his companions
                  into the dock. Keep him back!' she shrieked, as Emory, with the look of a maniac,
                  was rushing towards her—'keep him back! I have not yet finished my
                  confession.'</p>
               <p>A desperate struggle took place between Emory and Harry, but the latter being much
                  the stronger of the two, at length forced the angered man into a seat, and
                  Estelle, having recovered breath, proceeded—</p>
               <p>'And now for another important matter. Some weeks since, that boy whose death I
                  have just been describing, while secreted in your house for the purpose of theft,
                  abstracted certain papers relating to property in Texas, from a tin-box, and
                  brought them to me.'</p>
               <p>A new fear was awakened in Emory's mind, as he derisively asked, in a voice of
                  assumed calmness—</p>
               <p>'And what use could you possibly make of a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">bona
                     fide</foreign> deed of conveyance, even if you did get possession of it?'</p>
               <p>'None,' returned Estelle, 'but unfortunately for you the deed which I received was
                  a forged one, and wrapped up with it was a written confession of one George
                  Cantwell, (alias Wm. Walker) giving a minute and particular account of the whole
                  transaction. This confession was secreted in the box containing the deed from
                  motives of revenge, by your late <foreign xml:lang="FRA">employee,</foreign> and
                  the papers are now on their way to the rightful heirs of the murdered Jerome
                  Newman's Texas property.'</p>
               <p>The countenance of Emory at this moment was frightful to behold. He saw that all
                  his long cherished hopes were blasted—that he was betrayed—branded with the crimes
                  of murder and forgery—and exposed before a stranger. His eyes rolled round in his
                  head with an expression of lunatic ferocity—his nostrils dilated, his lips
                  quivered, and the white foam oozed from between his set teeth as he struggled to
                  break from the grasp of Harry, who held him with vice-like firmness.</p>
               <p>'A moment more,' said Estelle, faintly, 'and my confes- sion will be complete. It
                  was I who brought this about. For the last sixteen years I have toiled for, hoped
                  for, waited for, this blissful moment, and now that it has come, I am ready and
                  willing to die. Emory!' she cried, by a last desperate effort raising herself in
                  bed, and turning her dying eyes savagely upon her husband, 'brutal, black-hearted
                  beast! look upon me, and say am I not terribly revenged? Ha! ha I are you stricken
                  dumb? Have I touched you to the quick? Ha! ha! ha!'</p>
               <p>Summoning all his energies, with one desperate exertion, Emory broke from his
                  custodian, and with desperate force rushed at and caught the wretched creature by
                  the throat,<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6405-00000174"/> but his fingers clasped the
                  neck of a corpse—for the eye was glazed—the jaw had dropped—and the spirit had
                  passed away with the last effort of worn-out nature. For some moments he
                  maintained his clutch upon the inanimate form, but when he found that she was
                  indeed dead, a sudden desire to revenge himself upon the person who had been a
                  listener to the horrible revelation seized him, and he turned to attack Harry, but
                  that person had left the room to procure assistance, and he found himself alone.
                  'Ha!' he cried, as a look of desperation settled upon his features, 'he would
                  procure my arrest, but I will baulk him there!' and springing out of the door, he
                  made his way through the court and down the alley-way into the street, when he
                  started off on a run, and did not stop till he reached the house in which he
                  resided. Letting himself in with his latch-key, he made his way to his library,
                  and locked the door.</p>
               <p>He found a letter from Hollowell lying upon his table, and hastily breaking the
                  seal, he read as follows:</p>

                           <p>"MY DEAR EMORY.—I have thought for some time past that you and I have
                              been associated about long enough, and under this conviction, I have
                              concluded to withdraw myself from your society, and locate myself in
                              some part of the world where I will be enabled to enjoy myself
                              rationally. I have succeeded in netting a very handsome amount, (say
                              five thousand dollars,) in the prosecution of the business upon which
                              you sent me, and this, together with some ten or fifteen thousand
                              which I have obtained upon the property entrusted to me by you is
                              enough to satisfy me at present. I am aware that you possess property
                              in Texas to a large amount, and perhaps an equal dividend between us
                              would make my share larger. I am not greedy, however, and I freely
                              forgive you all indebtedness to me. Trusting that you will always be
                              dealt with as honestly as I have dealt with you, allow me to subscribe
                              myself, my dear Emory,</p>
                           <closer>
                              <salute>Yours very truly,</salute>

               <p>He threw the letter aside with an expression of contempt, and then taking one of
                  the pistols which he had used on the night of the attempted burglary from its
                  case, he deliberately loaded it, and then seated himself in his easy chair to
                  reflect. 'I should prefer some other mode of death,' he muttered, 'were it not for
                  the trouble of procuring it. Let me see,' he continued as he laid the pistol upon
                  his lap and pressed his hand upon his throbbing temples, 'could I not send the
                  wench to the druggist to procure—'</p>
               <p>But just as he had arrived at this point in his cogitations, the door bell was
                  violently agitated, and springing from his chair, he exclaimed—</p>
               <p>'Ah, then, I am too late, and this is my only chance to baffle them!' As he spoke
                  he placed the muzzle of the pistol in his mouth, pulled the trigger, and the next
                  moment his blood and brains bespattered the wall behind him. A contraction of the
                  muscles—a deep groan—a death rattle in the throat—and the spirit of Everard Emory
                  had joined that of his guilty wife. Both were beyond the jurisdiction of human
                  law, but they had flown to the presence of a Judge from whose frown even death
                  could not deliver them. Harry was the principal witness at the separate inquests
                  held upon their bodies, and under his superintendence both were interred in one
                  grave in Greenwood.</p>

               <p>LITTLE now remains for the narrator to say. He has only to make a slight allusion
                  to certain of his characters, and the task which he set out to accomplish will be
                  completed.</p>
               <p>The widow Wallace received the documents mailed by Harry —— at the request of
                  Estelle, and in due time obtained possession of the property left by her murdered
                  first husband. Her pecuniary wants were few, for she had a happy and contented
                  home with her son-in-law and daughter Helen, but the money enabled her to gratify
                  to the fullest extent her enlarged feelings of philanthropy, as well as to settle
                  a handsome sum upon two little grand-children, who daily made her aged heart beat
                  fast with joy as they gambolled in the sunlight of her happy smiles.</p>
               <p>Jack Ainslie left the police department, and was started in a lucrative business
                  by Robert Barker, at whose house he and his wife Mary were constant visitors.</p>
               <p>Richard Hamilton and his wife Minnie also kept up the acquaintance which had
                  existed between them and the before-mentioned parties previous to the double
                  marriage, and every succeeding anniversary of that interesting event was sure to
                  call them all together.</p>
               <p>Frank Camp returned to New Orleans a wiser and a better man, and in atonement for
                  his many misdeeds he took upon himself a sort of penance by marrying Miss Lydia
                  Dunlap.</p>
               <p>Tony Butters died of a stroke of apoplexy brought on by excitement consequent upon
                  the failure of a heavy speculation in which he had engaged.</p>
               <p>Philip Tieman returned to St. Louis and astonished the acquaintances of the Grant
                  family by a recital of what he had witnessed.</p>
               <p>The body of Kate O'Donnell was found floating in the East River, she having thrown
                  herself from the dock after rushing from the miserable abode in which Estelle
                  died. The remains were not recognized, and as a matter of course a verdict of
                  'Found Drowned' was returned by the Coroner's jury.</p>
               <p>The despicable old hag, Mother Waffles, dragged out a horrible existence to late
                  old age, and died at last in a miserable cellar, from the combined effects of
                  starvation and cold.</p>
               <p>Hollowell never had the pleasure of spending his ill-gotten gains. He was killed
                  by a steamboat explosion on the Ohio river, while on his way from Pittsburgh to
                  Cincinnati.</p>
               <p>Two characters remain yet to be spoken of—Cantwell and his paramour Florence.
                  About a year after the death of Estelle, Robert Barker and his wife, together with
                  the son of James Ely, (who after Emory commited suicide had been taken under their
                  protection,) started on a travelling tour South. They stopped on their way in
                  Philadelphia a few days, and while there they visited Moyamensing Prison, where,
                  among the prisoners in the male department, they observed Cantwell busily engaged
                  in making boots, and in the female department the guilty partner of his flight
                     picking<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6405-00000176"/> oakum. Upon asking the
                  official who conducted them around the prison, the nature of the offence for which
                  these two miserable creatures were incarcerated, Barker was told that they were
                  notorious panel thieves.</p>

            <p>particularly intended as a Book of Reference for the Solution of Difficulties
               connected with Grammar, Composition, Punctuation, &amp;c., with Explanations of Latin
               and French words and Phrases of frequent occurrence in Newspapers, Reviews,

            <p>"Live and Learn" is a most useful book, designed as a Guide to Grammar, Composition,
               and Punctuation. So few people speak or write really good grammar, and fewer still
               punctuate decently, that a book that informs them how to do so—and not only that
               indicates their faults, but shows them how they are to be corrected—cannot fail to be
               popular; <emph>there is not a person indeed, who might not learn something from
                  it.</emph>
            </p>
            <p>No work heretofore written on this subject contains one half the really useful
               information that the present does. It should be in the hand of every man, woman and
               child in the country, and is alike invaluable to the Scholar, the Merchant, the
               Farmer, and the Artizan.</p>
            <p>There are hundreds of persons engaged in professional and commercial pursuits, who
               are sensible of their deficiencies on many points connected with the grammar of their
               own tongue, and who by self-tuition, are anxious to correct such deficiencies, and to
               acquire the means of speaking and writing, if not with elegance at least with a due
               regard to grammatical accuracy, to whom this little work is "indispensible." As a
               book of reference, "Live and Learn" will settle many disputes. It ought to be on
               every table, and be particularly recommended to the young, before habit makes common
               blunders uncommon hard to cure.</p>

                     young student, or even the ripe scholar, and as deserving to be generally

                  rules for their correction so clear, so terse, and at once so simple that the most
                  ordinary mind cannot fail to comprehend their meaning. This is one of the chief
                  beauties of "Live and Learn," for what is the use of pointing out a grammatical
                  error without giving a key to its correction? There has been several catchpenny
                  works on this subject lately issued. They tell the reader that mistakes exist, but
                  give no rule for their avoidance. If you want a really good work, buy "Live and

               <p>The above novels, by the talented daughter of the late Captain Marryatt, were
                  written in compliance with the wishes of her father, expressed a short time
                  previous to his death; and the fair authoress alludes to this circumstance by way
                  of apology, in the preface to "Temper." We predict for them a wide spread
                  popularity. They are original in style, truly moral and religious in tone, and are
                  calculated to accomplish much good, as the author aims some telling blows at the

                  sober, truthful earnestness with which it is related, will at once communicate

                  a novel. It is fascinating from beginning to ending, and no reader will lay it

            <p>"We have perused this work with some attention, and do not hesitate, to pronounce it
               one of the very best productions of the talented author. There is not a page that
               does not glow with thrilling and interesting incident, and will well repay the reader
               for the time occupied in perusing it. The characters are most admirably drawn, and
               are perfectly natural throughout. We have derived so much gratification from the
               perusal of this charming novel, that we are anxious to make our readers share it with
               us: and, at the same time, to recommend it to be read by all persons who are fond of
               romantic adventures. Mr. Bennett is a spirited and vigorous writer, and his works
               deserve to be generally read; not only because they are well written, but that they
               are, in most part, taken from events connected with the history of our own country,
               from which much valuable information is derived, and should, therefore, have a double
               claim upon our preference, over those works where the incidents are gleaned from the
               romantic legends of old castles and foreign climes.—<title>Louisville

            <p>This the title of a most wonderful book, written by a lady of New Orleans, and issued
               from the press for the perusal of all persons whose minds have been poisoned by the
               pernicious exaggerations of American life and Negro Slavery to be found in "Uncle
               Tom's Cabin" and "Dred." The lady of New Orleans has done her work manfully. The book
               shows clearly that those who cry out against Negro Slavery, and utter the rankest
               falsehoods about that institution, are the supporters and proprietors of a system of
                  <emph>white</emph> slavery more cruel and debasing in its character and operations
               than the most skilful romancist could imagine. All this is shown in a Tale abounding
               with spirited and dramatic scenes and incidents. "TIT FOR TAT" embraces forty

               <p>This is "carrying the war into Africa" with a vengeance. It is more than "a Roland
                  for an Oliver." It is more caustic than even "Change for Dickens' American Notes.
                  By a lady." "Dred, a Tale of the Dismal Swamp," the offspring of foreign
                  influence; British influence; subsidising and Anglicising the Yankee pen of
                  Harriet Beecher Stowe, is answered most effectually in a tale of white slavery,
                  far more dismal than all the carricatures that have ever been painted of Negro
                  servitude in the South. Our bane and antidote are both before us. "Tit for Tat" is
                  confined to England and the English, and is, therefore, a more direct and
                  appropriate reply to the Duchess of Sutherland's minion. The bold, startling
                  pictures are drawn from real life, and their darkest shadows do not exaggerate the
                  depths of degradation and misery into which the fairest specimens of God's
                  handiwork are plunged; white men capable of appreciating misery in its highest
                  forms, and on enjoying all its benefits and refinements. And all the suffering and
                  woe depicted by the author with masculine vigor are the direct results of the
                  cruel oppression of the arristocracy, to whom Mrs. Stowe plays the flunkey,
                  flattering in their vices, the tyrants who wallow in luxury upon the toil and

                  <p>The Adventures of Capt. Blake is a thrilling work, replete with adventure,
                     incident, character, and plot of an exciting description. It will prove one of
                     the most popular novels of the season. The interest excited is very great, and
                     we regret that it will not bear such division as would enable us to give an
                     intelligible extract.—<title>Weekly Dispatch.</title>

                  <p>This capital book is of the "Charles O'Malley" school; full of dashing
                     adventures, love intrigues, brilliant sketches of battle scenes, in which the
                     inspiring, headlong charge and terrible defeat are detailed with all the force
                     of truth. The warlike descriptions will vie with the most animated scenes in
                     Alison or Napier: and the humorous portions of the book have no peers but in
                     the pages of Lever or Lover.</p>

                     versatile pen of Samuel Lover, Esq., whose expressions in describing the scenes
                     and heroes of his fancy have cracked many a side, and convulsed many a
                     countenance with laughter. Handy Andy speaks for itself to the hearts of all
