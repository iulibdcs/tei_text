               <salute>MY DEAR SIR:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I DO not know to whom I could more appropriately dedicate this little book than to
               one who has been so long my teacher; and who has seemed to be, so long, my
               friend.</p>
            <p>It is true, that until six months ago, I had never the honor of meeting with you:
               but, there are thousands, Sir, who have never seen you who yet know you, and esteem
               you, as fully as myself.</p>
            <pb n="ii-iii" xml:id="VAC7259-00000003"/>
            <p>If I have attained to any facility in the use of language, or have gained any fitness
               of expression, in which to dress my thoughts,—I know not to what writer of the
               English language, I am more indebted, than to you. And if I have shown—as I have
               tried to show—a truthfulness of feeling, that is not lighted by any counterfeit of
               passion, but rather, by a close watchfulness of nature, and a cordial sympathy with
               human suffering—I know not to what man's heart, that truthfulness will come home
               sooner, than to your's.</p>
            <p>Believe me, Dear Sir, it is from no wish to associate my name with the names of the
               great, that I ask your acceptance of this little token of respect. My aims are
               humbler than this: I would simply pay homage to the Author, who has wrought our
               language into the most exquisite forms of beauty; and to the man, who has touched our
               hearts, with the tenderness of a friend.</p>
            <p>And if I might hope, that this simple mark of my admiration, and of my esteem, would
               commend me to your charity—to say nothing of your regard—it is all that I would
               ask.</p>

                  <p>——PSHAW!—said my Aunt Tabithy,—have you not done with dreaming?</p>
                  <p>My Aunt Tabithy, though an excellent, and most notable person, loves
                     occasionally a quiet bit of satire. And when I told her, that I was sharpening
                     my pen for a new story of those dreamy fancies, and half experiences, which lie
                     grouped along the journeying hours of my solitary life, she smiled as if in
                     derision.</p>
                  <p>——"Ah, Isaac," said she, "all that is exhausted: you have rung so many changes
                     on your hopes and<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7259-00000007"/> your dreams, that
                     you have nothing left, but to make them real——if you can."</p>
                  <p>It is very idle to get angry with a good-natured old lady: I did better than
                     this:—I made her listen to me.</p>
                  <p>——Exhausted, do you say, Aunt Tabithy? Is life then exhausted, is hope gone
                     out, is fancy dead?</p>
                  <p>No, no. Hope and the world are full; and he who drags into book-pages a phase
                     or two of the great life of passion, of endurance, of love, of sorrow, is but
                     wetting a feather, in the sea that breaks ceaselessly along the great shore of
                     the years. Every man's heart is a living drama; every death is a drop-scene;
                     every book only a faint foot-light to throw a little flicker on the stage.</p>
                  <p>There is no need of wandering widely to catch incident or adventure: they are
                     everywhere about us; each day is a succession of escapes and joys;—not perhaps
                     clear to the world, but brooding in our thought, and living in our brain. From
                     the very first, Angels and Devils are busy with us, and we are struggling
                     against them, and for them.</p>
                  <p>No, no, Aunt Tabithy,—this life of musing does not exhaust so easily. It is
                     like the springs on the farmland, that are fed with all the showers and the
                     dews of the year, and that from the narrow fissures of the rock, send up
                     streams continually:—or it is like the deep well in the meadow, where one may
                     see stars at noon—when no stars are shining.</p>
                  <p>What is Reverie, and what are these Day-dreams, but fleecy cloud-drifts that
                     float eternally, and eternally change shapes, upon the great over-arching sky
                     of thought? You may seize the strong outlines that the passion breezes of
                     to-day shall throw into their figures; but to-morrow may breed a whirlwind that
                     will chase swift, gigantic shadows over the heaven of your thought, and change
                     the whole landscape of your life.</p>
                  <p>Dream-land will never be exhausted, until we enter the land of dreams; and
                     until, in "shuffling off this mortal coil," thought will become fact, and all
                     facts will be only thought.</p>
                  <p>As it is, I can conceive no mood of mind more in keeping with what is to follow
                     upon the grave, than those fancies which warp our frail hulks toward the ocean
                     of the Infinite; and that so sublimate the realities of this being, that they
                     seem to belong to that shadowy realm, where every day's journey is leading.</p>
                  <p>It was warm weather; and my aunt was dozing. "What is this all to be about?"
                     said she, recovering her knitting needle.</p>
                  <p>"About love, and toil, and duty, and sorrow," said I.</p>
                  <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7259-00000008"/>
                  <p>My aunt laid down her knitting, looked at me over the rim of her spectacles,
                     and——took snuff.</p>
                  <p>I said nothing.</p>
                  <p>"How many times have you been in love, Isaac?" said she.</p>
                  <p>It was now my turn to say——"Pshaw!"</p>
                  <p>Judging from her look of assurance, I could not possibly have made a more
                     satisfactory reply.</p>
                  <p>My aunt finished the needle she was upon—smoothed the stocking leg over her
                     knee, and looking at me with a very comical expression, said,—"Isaac, you are a
                     sad fellow!"</p>
                  <p>I did not like the tone of this: it sounded very much as if it would have been
                     in the mouth of any one else——'bad fellow.'</p>
                  <p>And she went on to ask me in a very bantering way, if my stock of youthful
                     loves was not nearly exhausted; and she cited the episode of the fair-haired
                     Enrica, as perhaps the most tempting that I could draw from my experience.</p>
                  <p>A better man than myself,—if he had only a fair share of vanity,—would have
                     been nettled at this; and I replied somewhat tartly, that I had never professed
                     to write my experiences. These might be more or less tempting; but certainly,
                     if they were of a kind which I have attempted to portray in the characters of
                     Bella, or of Carry, neither my Aunt Tabithy nor any one else, should have
                     learned such truth from any book of mine. There are griefs too sacred to be
                     babbled to the world; and there may be loves, which one would forbear to
                     whisper even to a friend.</p>
                  <p>No, no,—imagination has been playing pranks with memory; and if I have made the
                     feeling real, I am content that the facts should be false. Feeling indeed has a
                     higher truth in it, than circumstance. It appeals to a larger jury, for
                     acquittal: it is approved or condemned by a better judge. And if I can catch
                     this bolder and richer truth of feeling, I will not mind if the types of it are
                     all fabrications.</p>
                  <p>If I run over some sweet experience of love, (my Aunt Tabithy brightened a
                     little) must I make good the fact that the loved one lives, and expose her name
                     and qualities, to make your sympathy sound? Or shall I not rather be working
                     upon higher and holier ground, if I take the passion for itself, and so weave
                     it into words, that you, and every willing sufferer may recognize the fervor,
                     and forget the personality?</p>
                  <p>Life after all is but a bundle of hints, each suggesting actual and positive
                     developement, but rarely reaching it. And as I recal these hints, and in fancy,
                     trace them to their issues, I am as truly dealing with life, as if my life had
                     dealt them all to me.</p>
                  <p>This is what I would be doing in the present book;—I would catch up here and
                     there the shreds of feeling,<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7259-00000009"/> which the
                     brambles and roughnesses of the world have left tangling on my heart, and weave
                     them out into those soft, and perfect tissues, which—if the world had been only
                     a little less rough,—might now perhaps enclose my heart altogether.</p>
                  <p>"Ah," said my Aunt Tabithy, as she smoothed the stocking leg again, with a
                     sigh,—"there is after all but one youth-time: and if you put down its memories
                     once, you can find no second growth."</p>
                  <p>My Aunt Tabithy was wrong. There is as much growth in the thoughts and feelings
                     that run behind us, as in those that run before us. You may make a rich, full
                     picture of your childhood to-day; but let the hour go by, and the darkness
                     stoop to your pillow with its million shapes of the past, and my word for it,
                     you shall have some flash of childhood lighten upon you, that was unknown to
                     your busiest thought of the morning.</p>
                  <p>Let a week go by; and in some interval of care, as you recal the smile of a
                     mother, or some pale sister who is dead, a new crowd of memories will rush upon
                     your soul, and leave their traces in such tears as will make you kinder and
                     better for days and weeks. Or you shall assist at some neighbor funeral, where
                     the little dead one—(like one you have seen before)—shall hold in its tiny
                     grasp—(as you have taught little dead hands to do)—fresh flowers, laughing
                     flowers, lying lightly on the white robe of the dear child—all
                     pale—cold—silent——</p>
                  <p>I had touched my Aunt Tabithy: she had dropped a stitch in her knitting. I
                     believe she was weeping.</p>
                  <p>—Aye, this brain of ours is a master-worker, whose appliances we do not one
                     half know; and this heart of ours is a rare storehouse, furnishing the brain
                     with new material every hour of our lives; and their limits we shall not know,
                     until they shall end—together.</p>
                  <p>Nor is there, as many faint-hearts imagine, but one phase of earnestness in our
                     life of feeling. One train of deep emotion cannot fill up the heart: it
                     radiates like a star, God-ward and earth-ward. It spends and reflects all ways.
                     Its force is to be reckoned not so much by token, as by capacity. Facts are the
                     poorest and most slumberous evidences of passion, or of affection. True feeling
                     is ranging everywhere; whereas your actual attachments are too apt to be tied
                     to sense.</p>
                  <p>A single affection may indeed be true, earnest and absorbing; but such an one
                     after all, is but a type—and if the object be worthy, a glorious type—of the
                     great book of feeling: it is only the vapor from the cauldron of the heart, and
                     bears no deeper relation to its exhaustless sources, than the letter which my
                     pen makes, bears to the thought that inspires it,—or than a single morning
                     strain of your orioles and thrushes, bears<pb n="18-19"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000010"/> to that wide bird-chorus, which is making every
                     sunrise—a worship, and every grove—a temple!</p>
                  <p>My Aunt Tabithy nodded.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this a mere bachelor fling against constancy. I can believe, Heaven
                     knows, in an unalterable and unflinching affection, which neither desires nor
                     admits the prospect of any other. But when one is tasking his brain to talk for
                     his heart,—when he is not writing positive history, but only making mention (as
                     it were) of the heart's capacities, who shall say that he has reached the
                     fullness,—that he has exhausted the stock of its feeling, or that he has
                     touched its highest notes? It is true there is but one heart in a man to be
                     stirred; but every stir creates a new combination of feeling, that like the
                     turn of a kaleidoscope will show some fresh color, or form.</p>
                  <p>A bachelor to be sure has a marvellous advantage in this; and with the
                     tenderest influences once anchored in the bay of marriage, there is little
                     disposition to scud off under each pleasant breeze of feeling. Nay, I can even
                     imagine—perhaps somewhat captiously—that after marriage, feeling would become a
                     habit, a rich and holy habit certainly, but yet a habit, which weakens the
                     omnivorous grasp of the affections, and schools one to a unity of emotion, that
                     doubts and ignores the promptness and variety of impulse, which we bachelors
                     possess.</p>
                  <p>My aunt nodded again.</p>
                  <p>Could it be that she approved what I had been saying? I hardly knew.</p>
                  <p>Poor old lady,—she did not know herself. She was asleep!</p>

                  <head type="sub">WITH MY READER.</head>
                  <p>HAVING silenced my Aunt Tabithy, I shall be generous enough in my triumph, to
                     offer an explanatory chat to my reader.</p>
                  <p>This is a history of Dreams; and there will be those who will sneer at such a
                     history, as the work of a dreamer. So indeed it is; and you, my courteous
                     reader, are a dreamer too!</p>
                  <p>You would perhaps like to find your speculations about wealth, marriage or
                     influence, called by some better name than Dreams. You would like to see the
                     history of them—if written at all—baptized at the font of your own vanity, with
                     some such title as—life's cares, or life's work. If there had been a
                     philosophic naming to my observations, you might have reckoned them good: as it
                     is, you count them all bald and palpable fiction.</p>
                  <p>But is it so? I care not how matter of fact you may be, you have in your own
                     life, at some time, proved the very truth of what I have set down: and the
                     chances are, that even now, gray as you may be, and economic as you may be, and
                     devotional as you pretend to be, you light up your Sabbath reflections with
                     just such dreams of wealth, of per centages, or of family, as you will find
                     scattered over these pages.</p>
                  <p>I am not to be put aside with any talk about stocks, and duties, and
                     respectability: all these though very eminent matters, are but so many types in
                     the volume of your thought; and your eager resolves about them, are but so many
                     ambitious waves, breaking up from that great sea of dreamy speculation, that
                     has spread over your soul, from its first start into the realm of
                     CONSCIOUSNESS.</p>
                  <p>No man's brain is so dull, and no man's eye so blind, that they cannot catch
                     food for dreams. Each little episode of life is full, had we but the perception
                     of its fullness. There is no such thing as blank, in the world of thought.
                     Every action and emotion have their development growing and gaining on the
                     soul. Every affection has its tears and smiles. Nay, the very material world is
                     full of meaning, and by suggesting<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7259-00000012"/>
                     thought, is making us what we are, and what we will be.</p>
                  <p>The sparrow that is twittering on the edge of my balcony, is calling up to me
                     this moment, a world of memories that reach over half my life time, and a world
                     of hope that stretches farther than any flight of sparrows. The rose-tree which
                     shades his mottled coat is full of buds and blossoms; and each bud and blossom
                     is a token of promise, that has issues covering life, and reaching beyond
                     death. The quiet sunshine beyond the flower and beyond the sparrow,—glistening
                     upon the leaves, and playing in delicious waves of warmth over the reeking
                     earth, is lighting both heart and hope, and quickening into activity a thousand
                     thoughts of what has been, and of what will be. The meadow stretching away
                     under its golden flood—waving with grain, and with the feathery blossoms of the
                     grass, and golden butter cups, and white, nodding daisies, comes to my eye like
                     the lapse of fading childhood,—studded here and there with the bright blossoms
                     of joy, crimsoned all over with the flush of health, and enamelled with
                     memories that perfume the soul. The blue hills beyond, with deep blue shadows
                     gathered in their bosom, lie before me like mountains of years, over which I
                     shall climb through shadows to the slope of Age, and go down to the deeper
                     shadows of Death.</p>
                  <p>Nor are dreams without their variety, whatever your character may be. I care
                     not how much, in the pride of your practical judgment, or in your learned
                     fancies, you may sneer at any dream of love, and reckon it all a poet's
                     fiction: there are times when such dreams come over you like a summer cloud,
                     and almost stifle you with their warmth.</p>
                  <p>Seek as you will for increase of lands or moneys, and there are moments when a
                     spark of some giant mind will flash over your cravings, and wake your soul
                     suddenly to a quick, and yearning sense of that influence which is begotten of
                     intellect; and you task your dreams—as I have copied them here—to build before
                     you the pleasures of such a renown.</p>
                  <p>I care not how worldly you may be: there are times when all distinctions seem
                     like dust, and when at the graves of the great, you dream of a coming country,
                     where your proudest hopes shall be dimmed forever.</p>
                  <p>Married or unmarried, young or old, poet or worker, you are still a dreamer,
                     and will one time know, and feel, that your life is but a dream. Yet you call
                     this fiction: you stave off the thoughts in print which come over you in
                     reverie. You will not admit to the eye what is true to the heart. Poor
                     weakling, and worldling,—you are not strong enough to face yourself!</p>
                  <p>You will read perhaps with smiles: you will possibly<pb n="24-25"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000013"/> praise the ingenuity: you will talk, with a lip
                     schooled against the slightest quiver, of some bit of pathos, and say that it
                     is—well done. Yet why is it well done?—only because it is stolen from your very
                     life and heart. It is good, because it is so common:—ingenious, because it is
                     so honest:—well-conceived, because it is not conceived at all.</p>
                  <p>There are thousands of mole-eyed people, who count all passion in print—a
                     lie:—people who will grow into a rage at trifles, and weep in the dark, and
                     love in secret, and hope without mention, and cover it all under the cloak of
                     what they call—propriety. I can see before me now some gray-haired old
                     gentleman, very money-getting, very correct, very cleanly, who reads the
                     morning paper with unction, and his Bible with determination: who listens to
                     dull sermons with patience, and who prays with quiet self-applause,—and yet
                     there are moments belonging to his life, when his curdled affections yearn for
                     something that they have not, when his avarice oversteps all the
                     commandments,—when his pride builds castles full of splendor; and yet put this
                     before his eye, and he reads with the most careless air in the world, and
                     condemns as arrant fiction, what cannot be proved to the elders.</p>
                  <p>We do not like to see our emotions unriddled: it is not agreeable to the proud
                     man to find his weaknesses exposed: it is shocking to the disappointed lover to
                     see his heart laid bare: it is a great grief to the pining maiden to witness
                     the exposure of her loves. We do not like our fancies painted: we do not
                     contrive them for rehearsal: our dreams are private, and when they are made
                     public, we disown them.</p>
                  <p>I sometimes think that I must be a very honest fellow, for writing down those
                     fancies which every one else seems afraid to whisper. I shall at least, come in
                     for my share of the odium in entertaining such fancies: indeed I shall expect
                     the charge of entertaining them exclusively; and shall scarce expect to find a
                     single fellow-confessor, unless it be some pure, and innocent thoughted girl,
                     who will say <foreign xml:lang="LAT">peccavi,</foreign> to—here and there—a
                     single rainbow fancy.</p>
                  <p>Well, I can bear it; but in bearing it, I shall be consoled with the reflection
                     that I have a great company of fellow-sufferers, who lack only the honesty to
                     tell me of their sympathy. It will even relieve in no small degree my burden,
                     to watch the effort they will take to conceal, what I have so boldly
                     divulged.</p>
                  <p>Nature is very much the same thing in one man, that it is in another: and as I
                     have already said, Feeling has a higher truth in it, than circumstance. Let it
                     only be touched fairly and honestly, and the heart of humanity answers; but if
                     it be touched foully or one-sidedly, you may find here and there a
                        lame-souled<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7259-00000014"/> creature who will give
                     response, but there is no heart throb in it.</p>
                  <p>Of one thing I am sure:—if my pictures are fair, worthy, and hearty, you
                        <emph>must</emph> see it in the reading: but if they are forced and hard, no
                     amount of kindness can make you feel their truth as I want them felt.</p>
                  <p>I make no self-praise out of this: if feeling has been honestly set down, it is
                     only in virtue of a native impulse, over which I have altogether too little
                     control; but if it is set down badly, I have wronged Nature, and, (as Nature is
                     kind) I have wronged myself.</p>
                  <p>A great many inquisitive people will, I do not doubt, be asking after all this
                     prelude, if my pictures are true pictures? The question,—the courteous reader
                     will allow me to say,—is an impertinent one. It is but a shabby truth that
                     wants an author's affidavit to make it trust-worthy. I shall not help my story
                     by any such poor support. If there are not enough elements of truth, honesty
                     and nature in my pictures, to make them believed, they shall have no oath of
                     mine to bolster them up.</p>
                  <p>I have been a sufferer in this way before now; and a little book that I had the
                     whim to publish a year since, has been set down by many as an arrant piece of
                     imposture. Claiming sympathy as a Bachelor, I have been recklessly set down as
                     a cold, undeserving man of family! My story of troubles and loves has been
                     sneered at, as the sheerest gammon.</p>
                  <p>But among this crowd of cold-blooded critics, it was pleasant to hear of one or
                     two pursy old fellows who railed at me, for winning the affections of a sweet
                     Italian girl, and then leaving her to pine in discontent! Yet in the face of
                     this, an old companion of mine in Rome, with whom I accidentally met the other
                     day,—wondered how on earth I could have made so tempting a story out of the
                     matronly and black-haired spinster, with whom I happened to be quartered in the
                     Eternal City!</p>
                  <p>I shall leave my critics to settle such differences between themselves; and
                     consider it far better to bear with slanders from both sides of the house, than
                     to bewray the pretty tenderness of the pursy old gentlemen, or to cast a doubt
                     upon the practical testimony of my quondam companion. Both give me high and
                     judicious compliment—all the more grateful because only half deserved. For I
                     never yet was conscious—alas, that the confession should be forced from me!—of
                     winning the heart of any maiden whether native, or Italian; and as for such
                     delicacy of imagination as to work up a lovely damsel out of the withered
                     remnant that forty odd years of Italian life can spare, I can assure my
                     middle-aged friends, (and it may serve as a <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                        >caveat</foreign>)—I can lay no claim to it whatever.</p>
                  <p>The trouble has been, that those who have believed<pb n="28-29"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000015"/> one passage have discredited another; and those
                     who have sympathized with me in trifles, have deserted me when affairs grew
                     earnest. I have had sympathy enough with my married griefs; but when it came to
                     the perplexing torments of my single life——not a weeper could I find!</p>
                  <p>I would suggest to those who intend to believe only half of my present book,
                     that they exercise a little discretion in their choice. I am not fastidious in
                     the matter; and only ask them to believe what counts most toward the goodness
                     of humanity, and to discredit—if they will persist in it—only what tells badly
                     for our common nature. The man or the woman who believes well, is apt to work
                     well; and Faith is as much the key to happiness here, as it is the key to
                     happiness hereafter.</p>
                  <p>I have only one thing more to say, before I get upon my story. A great many
                     sharp-eyed people, who have a horror of light reading—by which they mean
                     whatever does not make mention of stocks, cottons, or moral homilies,—will find
                     much fault with my book for its ephemeral character.</p>
                  <p>I am sorry that I cannot gratify such: homilies are not at all in my habit; and
                     it does seem to me an exhausting way of disposing of a good moral, to hammer it
                     down to a single point, so that there shall be only one chance of driving it
                     home. For my own part, I count it a great deal better philosophy to fuse it,
                     and rarify it, so that it shall spread out into every crevice of a story, and
                     give a color and a taste, as it were, to the whole mass.</p>
                  <p>I know there are very good people, who if they cannot lay their finger on so
                     much doctrine set down in old fashioned phrase, will never get an inkling of it
                     at all. With such people, goodness is a thing of understanding, more than of
                     feeling; and all their morality has its action in the brain.</p>
                  <p>God forbid that I should sneer at this terrible infirmity, which Providence has
                     seen fit to inflict: God forbid too, that I should not be grateful to the same
                     kind Providence, for bestowing upon others among his creatures a more genial
                     apprehension of true goodness, and a hearty sympathy with every shade of human
                     kindness!</p>
                  <p>But in all this, I am not making out a case for my own correct teaching, or
                     insinuating the propriety of my tone. I shall leave the book in this regard, to
                     speak for itself; and whoever feels himself growing worse for the reading, I
                     advise to lay it down. It will be very harmless on the shelf, however it may be
                     in the hand.</p>
                  <p>I shall lay no claim to the title of moralist, teacher, or romancist:—my
                     thoughts start pleasant pictures to my mind; and in a garrulous humor, I put my
                        finger<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7259-00000016"/> in the button-hole of my
                     indulgent friend, and tell him some of them,—giving him leave to quit me
                     whenever he chooses.</p>
                  <p>Or, if a lady is my listener, let her fancy me only an honest, simple-hearted
                     fellow, whose familiarities are so innocent that she can pardon them;—taking
                     her hand in his, and talking on;—sometimes looking in her eyes, and then
                     looking into the sunshine for relief;—sometimes prosy with narrative, and then
                     sharpening up my matter with a few touches of honest pathos;—let her imagine
                     this, I say, and we may become the most excellent friends in the world.</p>

               <head>DREAMS OF BOYHOOD.</head>
               <head>SPRING.</head>
               <p>THE old chroniclers made the year begin in the season of frosts; and they have
                  launched us upon the current of the months, from the snowy banks of January. I
                  love better to count time, from spring to spring; it seems to me far more
                  cheerful, to reckon the year by blossoms, than by blight.</p>
               <p>Bernardin de St. Pierre, in his sweet story of Virginia, makes the bloom of the
                  cocoa-tree, or the growth of the banana, a yearly and a loved monitor of the
                  passage of her life. How cold and cheerless in the comparison, would be the icy
                  chronology of the North;——So many years have I seen the lakes locked, and the
                  foliage die!</p>
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7259-00000018"/>
               <p>The budding and blooming of spring, seem to belong properly to the opening of the
                  months. It is the season of the quickest expansion, of the warmest blood, of the
                  readiest growth; it is the boy-age of the year. The birds sing in chorus in the
                  spring—just as children prattle; the brooks run full—like the overflow of young
                  hearts; the showers drop easily—as young tears flow; and the whole sky is as
                  capricious as the mind of a boy.</p>
               <p>Between tears and smiles, the year, like the child, struggles into the warmth of
                  life. The old year,—say what the chronologists will,—lingers upon the very lap of
                  spring; and is only fairly gone, when the blossoms of April have strewn their pall
                  of glory upon his tomb, and the blue-birds have chanted his requiem.</p>
               <p>It always seems to me as if an access of life came with the melting of the
                  winter's snows; and as if every rootlet of grass that lifted its first green blade
                  from the matted debris of the old year's decay, bore my spirit upon it, nearer to
                  the largess of Heaven.</p>
               <p>I love to trace the break of spring step by step: I love even those long
                  rain-storms that sap the icy fortresses of the lingering winter,—that melt the
                  snows upon the hills, and swell the mountain-brooks;—that make the pools heave up
                  their glassy cerements of ice, and hurry down the crashing fragments into the
                  wastes of ocean.</p>
               <p>I love the gentle thaws that you can trace, day by day, by the stained snow-banks,
                  shrinking from the grass; and by the gentle drip of the cottage-eaves. I love to
                  search out the sunny slopes by a southern wall, where the reflected sun does
                  double duty to the earth, and where the frail anemone, or the faint blush of the
                  arbutus, in the midst of the bleak March atmosphere, will touch your heart, like a
                  hope of Heaven, in a field of graves! Later come those soft, smoky days, when the
                  patches of winter grain show green under the shelter of leafless woods, and the
                  last snow-drifts, reduced to shrunken skeletons of ice, lie upon the slope of
                  northern hills, leaking away their life.</p>
               <p>Then, the grass at your door grows into the color of the sprouting grain, and the
                  buds upon the lilacs swell, and burst. The peaches bloom upon the wall, and the
                  plums wear bodices of white. The sparkling oriole picks string for his hammock on
                  the sycamore, and the sparrows twitter in pairs. The old elms throw down their
                  dingy flowers, and color their spray with green; and the brooks, where you throw
                  your worm or the minnow, float down whole fleets of the crimson blossoms of the
                  maple. Finally, the oaks step into the opening quadrille of spring, with greyish
                  tufts of a modest verdure, which, by and by, will be long and glossy leaves. The
                  dog-wood pitches his broad, white tent, in the edge of the forest; the dandelions
                     lie<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7259-00000019"/> along the hillocks, like stars in
                  a sky of green; and the wild cherry, growing in all the hedge-rows, without other
                  culture than God's, lifts up to Him, thankfully, its tremulous white fingers.</p>
               <p>Amid all this, come the rich rains of spring. The affections of a boy grow up with
                  tears to water them; and the year blooms with showers. But the clouds hover over
                  an April sky, timidly—like shadows upon innocence. The showers come gently, and
                  drop daintily to the earth,—with now and then a glimpse of sunshine to make the
                  drops bright—like so many tears of joy.</p>
               <p>The rain of winter is cold, and it comes in bitter scuds that blind you; but the
                  rain of April steals upon you coyly, half reluctantly,—yet lovingly—like the steps
                  of a bride to the Altar.</p>
               <p>It does not gather like the storm-clouds of winter, grey and heavy along the
                  horizon, and creep with subtle and insensible approaches (like age) to the very
                  zenith; but there are a score of white-winged swimmers afloat, that your eye has
                  chased, as you lay fatigued with the delicious languor of an April sun;—nor have
                  you scarce noticed that a little bevy of those floating clouds had grouped
                  together in a sombre company. But presently, you see across the fields, the dark
                  grey streaks stretching like lines of mists, from the green bosom of the valley,
                  to that spot of sky where the company of clouds is loitering; and with an easy
                  shifting of the helm, the fleet of swimmers come drifting over you, and drop their
                  burden into the dancing pools, and make the flowers glisten, and the eaves drip
                  with their crystal bounty.</p>
               <p>The cattle linger still, cropping the new-come grass; and childhood laughs
                  joyously at the warm rain;—or under the cottage roof, catches with eager ear, the
                  patter of its fall.</p>
               <p>——And with that patter on the roof,—so like to the patter of childish feet—my
                  story of boyish dreams shall begin.</p>

                  <head type="sub">RAIN IN THE GARRET.</head>
                  <p>IT is an old garret with big, brown rafters; and the boards between are stained
                     darkly with the rain-storms of fifty years. And as the sportive April shower
                     quickens its flood, it seems as if its torrents would come dashing through the
                     shingles, upon you, and upon your play. But it will not; for you know that the
                     old roof is strong; and that it has kept you, and all that love you, for long
                     years from the rain, and from the cold: you know that the hardest storms of
                     winter will only make a little oozing leak, that trickles down the brown
                     stains,—like tears.</p>
                  <p>You love that old garret roof; and you nestle down under its slope, with a
                     sense of its protecting power that no castle walls can give to your maturer
                     years. Aye, your heart clings in boyhood to the roof-tree of the old family
                     garret, with a grateful affection, and an earnest confidence, that the after
                     years—whatever may be their successes, or their honors—can never re-create.
                     Under the roof-tree of his home, the boy feels SAFE: and where, in the whole
                     realm of life, with its bitter toils, and its bitterer temptations, will he
                     feel <emph>safe</emph> again?</p>
                  <p>But this you do not know. It seems only a grand old place; and it is capital
                     fun to search in its corners, and drag out some bit of quaint old furniture,
                     with a leg broken, and lay a cushion across it, and fix your reins upon the
                     lion's claws of the feet, and then—gallop away! And you offer sister Nelly a
                     chance, if she will be good; and throw out very patronizing words to little
                     Charlie, who is mounted upon a much humbler horse,—to wit, a decrepid
                     nursery-chair,—as he of right should be, since he is three years your
                     junior.</p>
                  <p>I know no nobler forage ground for a romantic, venturesome, mischievous boy,
                     than the garret of an old family mansion, on a day of storm. It is a perfect
                     field of chivalry. The heavy rafters, the dashing rain, the piles of spare
                     mattresses to carouse upon, the big trunks to hide in, the old white coats and
                     hats hanging in obscure corners, like ghosts—are great! And it is so far away
                     from the old lady, who keeps<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7259-00000021"/> rule in
                     the nursery, that there is no possible risk of a scolding, for twisting off the
                     fringe of the rug. There is no baby in the garret to wake up. There is no
                     'company' in the garret to be disturbed by the noise. There is no crotchety old
                     Uncle, or Grand-Ma, with their everlasting—"Boys—boys!"—and then a look of such
                     horror!</p>
                  <p>There is great fun in groping through a tall barrel of books and pamphlets, on
                     the look-out for startling pictures; and there are chestnuts in the garret,
                     drying, which you have discovered on a ledge of the chimney; and you slide a
                     few into your pocket, and munch them quietly,—giving now and then one to Nelly,
                     and begging her to keep silent;—for you have a great fear of its being
                     forbidden fruit.</p>
                  <p>Old family garrets have their stock, as I said, of cast-away clothes, of twenty
                     years gone by; and it is rare sport to put them on; buttoning in a pillow or
                     two for the sake of good fulness; and then to trick out Nelly in some
                     strange-shaped head-gear, and old-fashioned brocade petticoat caught up with
                     pins; and in such guise, to steal cautiously down stairs, and creep slily into
                     the sitting-room,—half afraid of a scolding, and very sure of good fun;—trying
                     to look very sober, and yet almost ready to die with the laugh that you know
                     you will make. And your mother tries to look harshly at little Nelly for
                     putting on her grandmother's best bonnet; but Nelly's laughing eyes forbid it
                     utterly; and the mother spoils all her scolding with a perfect shower of
                     kisses.</p>
                  <p>After this, you go marching, very stately, into the nursery; and utterly amaze
                     the old nurse; and make a deal of wonderment for the staring, half-frightened
                     baby, who drops his rattle, and makes a bob at you, as if he would jump into
                     your waistcoat pocket.</p>
                  <p>But you grow tired of this; you tire even of the swing, and of the pranks of
                     Charlie; and you glide away into a corner, with an old, dog's-eared copy of
                     Robinson Crusoe. And you grow heart and soul into the story, until you tremble
                     for the poor fellow with his guns, behind the palisade; and are yourself half
                     dead with fright, when you peep cautiously over the hill with your glass, and
                     see the cannibals at their orgies around the fire.</p>
                  <p>Yet, after all, you think the old fellow must have had a capital time, with a
                     whole island to himself; and you think you would like such a time yourself, if
                     only Nelly, and Charlie, could be there with you. But this thought does not
                     come till afterward; for the time, you are nothing but Crusoe; you are living
                     in his cave with Poll the parrot, and are looking out for your goats, and man
                     Friday.</p>
                  <p>You dream what a nice thing it would be, for you to slip away some pleasant
                     morning—not to York, as<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7259-00000022"/> young Crusoe
                     did, but to New York,—and take passage as a sailor; and how, if they knew you
                     were going, there would be such a world of good-byes; and how, if they did not
                     know it, there would be such a world of wonder!</p>
                  <p>And then the sailor's dress would be altogether such a jaunty affair; and it
                     would be such rare sport to lie off upon the yards far aloft, as you have seen
                     sailors in pictures, looking out upon the blue and tumbling sea. No thought now
                     in your boyish dreams, of sleety storms, and cables stiffened with ice, and
                     crashing spars, and great ice-bergs towering fearfully around you!</p>
                  <p>You would have better luck than even Crusoe; you would save a compass, and a
                     Bible, and stores of hatchets, and the captain's dog, and great puncheons of
                     sweetmeats (which Crusoe altogether overlooked); and you would save a tent or
                     two, which you could set up on the shore, and an American flag, and a small
                     piece of cannon, which you could fire as often as you liked. At night, you
                     would sleep in a tree—though you wonder how Crusoe did it,—and would say the
                     prayers you had been taught to say at home, and fall to sleep,—dreaming of
                     Nelly and Charlie.</p>
                  <p>At sunrise, or thereabouts, you would come down, feeling very much refreshed;
                     and make a very nice breakfast off of smoked herring and sea-bread, with a
                     little tle currant jam, and a few oranges. After this you would haul ashore a
                     chest or two of the sailors' clothes, and putting a few large jack-knives in
                     your pocket, would take a stroll over the island, and dig a cave somewhere, and
                     roll in a cask or two of sea-bread. And you fancy yourself growing after a time
                     very tall and corpulent, and wearing a magnificent goat-skin cap, trimmed with
                     green ribbons, and set off with a plume. You think you would have put a few
                     more guns in the palisade than Crusoe did, and charged them with a little more
                     grape.</p>
                  <p>After a long while, you fancy a ship would arrive, which would carry you back;
                     and you count upon very great surprise on the part of your father, and little
                     Nelly, as you march up to the door of the old family mansion, with plenty of
                     gold in your pocket, and a small bag of cocoanuts for Charlie, and with a great
                     deal of pleasant talk, about your island, far away in the South Seas.</p>
                  <p>——Or, perhaps it is not Crusoe at all, that your eyes and your heart cling to,
                     but only some little story about Paul and Virginia;—that dear little Virginia!
                     how many tears have been shed over her—not in garrets only, or by boys
                     only!</p>
                  <p>You would have liked Virginia—you know you would; but you perfectly hate the
                     beldame aunt, who sent for her to come to France; you think she must<pb
                        n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7259-00000023"/> have been like the old
                     school-mistress, who occasionally boxes your ears with the cover of the
                     spelling-book, or makes you wear one of the girls' bonnets, that smells
                     strongly of paste-board, and calico.</p>
                  <p>As for black Domingue, you think he was a capital old fellow; and you think
                     more of him, and his bananas, than you do of the bursting, throbbing heart of
                     poor Paul. As yet, Dream-life does not take hold on love. A little maturity of
                     heart is wanted, to make up what the poets call sensibility. If love should
                     come to be a dangerous, chivalric matter, as in the case of Helen Mar and
                     Wallace, you can very easily conceive of it, and can take hold of all the
                     little accessories of male costume, and embroidering of banners; but as for
                     pure sentiment, such as lies in the sweet story of Bernardin de St. Pierre, it
                     is quite beyond you.</p>
                  <p>The rich, soft nights, in which one might doze in his hammock, watching the
                     play of the silvery moon-beams upon the orange leaves, and upon the waves, you
                     can understand; and you fall to dreaming of that lovely Isle of France; and
                     wondering if Virginia did not perhaps have some relations on the island, who
                     raise pine-apples, and such sort of things, still?</p>
                  <p>——And so, with your head upon your hand, in your quiet garret corner, over some
                     such beguiling story, your thought leans away from the book, into your own
                     dreamy cruise over the sea of life.</p>

                  <head type="sub">SCHOOL DREAMS.</head>
                  <p>IT is a proud thing to go out from under the realm of a school-mistress, and to
                     be enrolled in a company of boys who are under the guidance of a master. It is
                     one of the earliest steps of worldly pride, which has before it a long and
                     tedious ladder of ascent. Even the advice of the old mistress, and the
                     nine-penny book that she thrusts into your hand as a parting gift, pass for
                     nothing; and her kiss of adieu, if she tenders it in the sight of your fellows,
                     will call up an angry rush of blood to the cheek, that for long years, shall
                     drown all sense of its kindness.</p>
                  <p>You have looked admiringly many a day upon the tall fellows who play at the
                     door of Dr. Bidlow's school: you have looked with reverence, second only<pb
                        n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7259-00000024"/> to that felt for the old village
                     church, upon its dark-looking heavy brick walls. It seemed to be redolent of
                     learning; and stopping at times, to gaze upon the gallipots and broken retorts,
                     at the second story window, you have pondered, in your boyish way, upon the
                     inscrutable wonders of Science, and the ineffable dignity of Dr. Bidlow's brick
                     school!</p>
                  <p>Dr. Bidlow seems to you to belong to a race of giants; and yet he is a spare,
                     thin man, with a hooked nose, a large, flat, gold watch-key, a crack in his
                     voice, a wig, and very dirty wristbands. Still you stand in awe at the mere
                     sight of him;—an awe that is very much encouraged by a report made to you by a
                     small boy,—that "Old Bid" keeps a large ebony ruler in his desk. You are amazed
                     at the small boy's audacity: it astonishes you that any one who had ever smelt
                     the strong fumes of sulphur and ether in the Doctor's room, and had seen him
                     turn red vinegar blue, (as they say he does) should call him "Old Bid!"</p>
                  <p>You, however, come very little under his control: you enter upon the proud
                     life, in the small boy's department,—under the dominion of the English master.
                     He is a different personage from Dr. Bidlow: he is a dapper, little man, who
                     twinkles his eye in a peculiar fashion, and who has a way of marching about the
                     school-room with his hands crossed behind him, giving a playful flirt to his
                     coat-tails. He wears a pen tucked behind his ear: his hair is carefully set up
                     at the sides, and upon the top, to conceal (as you think later in life) his
                     diminutive height; and he steps very springily around behind the benches,
                     glancing now and then at the books,—cautioning one scholar about his dogs-ears,
                     and startling another from a doze, by a very loud and odious snap of his
                     forefinger upon the boy's head.</p>
                  <p>At other times, he sticks a hand in the armlet of his waistcoat: he brandishes
                     in the other a thickish bit of smooth cherry-wood,—sometimes dressing his hair
                     withal; and again, giving his head a slight scratch behind the ear, while he
                     takes occasion at the same time, for an oblique glance at a fat boy in the
                     corner, who is reaching down from his seat after a little paper pellet, that
                     has just been discharged at him from some unknown quarter. The master steals
                     very cautiously and quickly to the rear of the stooping boy,—dreadfully exposed
                     by his unfortunate position,—and inflicts a stinging blow. A weak-eyed little
                     scholar on the next bench ventures a modest titter; at which the assistant
                     makes a significant motion with his ruler—on the seat, as it were, of an
                     imaginary pair of pantaloons,—which renders the weak-eyed boy on a sudden, very
                     insensible to the recent joke.</p>
                  <p>You, meantime, profess to be very much engrossed<pb n="48-49"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000025"/> with your grammar—turned up-side down: you think
                     it must have hurt; and are only sorry that it did not happen to a tall,
                     dark-faced boy who cheated you in a swop of jack-knives. You innocently think
                     that he must be a very bad boy; and fancy—aided by a suggestion of the old
                     nurse at home, on the same point,—that he will one day come to the gallows.</p>
                  <p>There is a platform on one side of the school-room, where the teacher sits at a
                     little red table, and they have a tradition among the boys, that a pin properly
                     bent, was one day put into the chair of the English master, and that he did not
                     wear his hand in the armlet of his waistcoat, for two whole days thereafter.
                     Yet his air of dignity seems proper enough in a man of such erudition, and such
                     grasp of imagination, as he must possess. For he can quote poetry,—some of the
                     big scholars have heard him do it:—he can parse the whole of Paradise Lost; and
                     he can cipher in Long Division, and the Rule of Three, as if it was all Simple
                     Addition; and then—such a hand as he writes, and such a superb capital B! It is
                     hard to understand how he does it.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes, lifting the lid of your desk, where you pretend to be very busy with
                     your papers, you steal the reading of some brief passage of Lazy Lawrence, or
                     of the Hungarian Brothers, and muse about it for hours afterward, to the great
                     detriment of your ciphering; or, deeply lost in the story of the Scottish
                     Chiefs, you fall to comparing such villains as Menteith with the stout boys who
                     tease you; and you only wish they could come within reach of the fierce
                     Kirkpatrick's claymore.</p>
                  <p>But you are frighted out of this stolen reading by a circumstance that stirs
                     your young blood very strangely. The master is looking very sourly on a certain
                     morning, and has caught sight of the little weak-eyed boy over beyond you,
                     reading Roderick Random. He sends out for a long birch rod, and having trimmed
                     off the leaves carefully,—with a glance or two in your direction,—he marches up
                     behind the bench of the poor culprit,—who turns deathly pale,—grapples him by
                     the collar, drags him out over the desks, his limbs dangling in a shocking way
                     against the sharp angles, and having him fairly in the middle of the room,
                     clinches his rod with a new, and, as it seems to you, a very sportive grip.</p>
                  <p>You shudder fearfully.</p>
                  <p>"Please don't whip me," says the boy whimpering.</p>
                  <p>"Aha!" says the smirking pedagogue, bringing down the stick with a quick, sharp
                     cut,—"you don't like it, eh?"</p>
                  <p>The poor fellow screams, and struggles to escape; but the blows come faster and
                     thicker. The blood tingles in your finger ends with indignation.</p>
                  <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7259-00000026"/>
                  <p>"Please don't strike me again," says the boy sobbing and taking breath, as he
                     writhes about the legs of the master;—"I won't read another time."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, you won't, sir—won't you? I don't mean you shall, sir," and the blows fall
                     thick and fast,—until the poor fellow crawls back, utterly crest-fallen and
                     heart-sick, to sob over his books.</p>
                  <p>You grow into a sudden boldness: you wish you were only large enough to beat
                     the master: you know such treatment would make you miserable: you shudder at
                     the thought of it: you do not believe he would dare: you know the other boy has
                     got no father. This seems to throw a new light upon the matter, but it only
                     intensifies your indignation. You are sure that no father would suffer it; or
                     if you thought so, it would sadly weaken your love for him. You pray Heaven
                     that it may never be brought to such proof.</p>
                  <p>——Let a boy once distrust the love or the tenderness of his parents, and the
                     last resort of his yearning affections—so far as the world goes—is utterly
                     gone. He is in the sure road to a bitter fate. His heart will take on a hard
                     iron covering, that will flash out plenty of fire in his after contact with the
                     world, but it will never—never melt!</p>
                  <p>There are some tall trees that overshadow an angle of the school-house; and the
                     larger scholars play some very surprising gymnastic tricks upon their lower
                     limbs: one boy for instance, will hang for an incredible length of time by his
                     feet, with his head down; and when you tell Charlie of it at night, with such
                     additions as your boyish imagination can contrive, the old nurse is shocked,
                     and states very gravely that it is dangerous; and that the blood all runs to
                     the head, and sometimes bursts out of the eyes and mouth. You look at that
                     particular boy with astonishment afterward; and expect to see him some day
                     burst into bleeding from the nose and ears, and flood the school-room
                     benches.</p>
                  <p>In time, however, you get to performing some modest experiments yourself upon
                     the very lowest limbs,—taking care to avoid the observation of the larger boys,
                     who else might laugh at you: you especially avoid the notice of one stout
                     fellow in pea-green breeches, who is a sort of 'bully' among the small boys,
                     and who delights in kicking your marbles about, very accidentally. He has a
                     fashion too of twisting his handkerchief into what he calls a 'snapper,' with a
                     knot at the end, and cracking at you with it, very much to the irritation of
                     your spirits, and of your legs.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes, when he has brought you to an angry burst of tears, he will very
                     graciously force upon you the handkerchief, and insist upon your cracking him
                     in return; which, as you know nothing about his effective<pb n="52-53"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000027"/> method of making the knot bite, is a very
                     harmless proposal on his part.</p>
                  <p>But you have still stronger reason to remember that boy. There are trees, as I
                     said, near the school; and you get the reputation after a time of a good
                     climber. One day you are well in the tops of the trees, and being dared by the
                     boys below, you venture higher—higher than any boy has ever gone before. You
                     feel very proudly; but just then catch sight of the sneering face of your old
                     enemy of the snapper; and he dares you to go upon a limb that he points
                     out.</p>
                  <p>The rest say,—for you hear them plainly—"it won't bear him." And Frank, a great
                     friend of yours, shouts loudly to you,—not to try.</p>
                  <p>"Pho," says your tormentor,—"the little coward!"</p>
                  <p>If you could whip him, you would go down the tree and do it willingly: as it
                     is, you cannot let him triumph: so you advance cautiously out upon the limb: it
                     bends and sways fearfully with your weight: presently it cracks: you try to
                     return, but it is too late: you feel yourself going:—your mind flashes
                     home—over your life—your hope—your fate, like lightning: then comes a sense of
                     dizziness,—a succession of quick blows, and a dull, heavy crash!</p>
                  <p>You are conscious of nothing again, until you find yourself in the great hall
                     of the school, covered with blood, the old Doctor standing over you with a
                     phial, and Frank kneeling by you, and holding your shattered arm, which has
                     been broken by the fall.</p>
                  <p>After this, come those long, weary days of confinement, when you lie still,
                     through all the hours of noon, looking out upon the cheerful sunshine, only
                     through the windows of your little room. Yet it seems a grand thing to have the
                     whole household attendant upon you. The doors are opened and shut softly, and
                     they all step noiselessly about your chamber; and when you groan with pain, you
                     are sure of meeting sad, sympathizing looks. Your mother will step gently to
                     your side and lay her cool, white hand upon your forehead; and little Nelly
                     will gaze at you from the foot of your bed with a sad earnestness, and with
                     tears of pity in her soft hazel eyes. And afterward, as your pain passes away,
                     she will bring you her prettiest books, and fresh flowers, and whatever she
                     knows you will love.</p>
                  <p>But it is dreadful, when you wake at night, from your feverish slumber, and see
                     nothing but the spectral shadows that the sick-lamp upon the hearth throws
                     aslant the walls; and hear nothing but the heavy breathing of the old nurse in
                     the easy chair, and the ticking of the clock upon the mantel! Then, silence and
                     the night crowd upon your soul drearily. But your thought is active. It shapes
                     at your bed-side the loved figure of your mother, or it calls up the<pb
                        n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7259-00000028"/> whole company of Dr. Bidlow's boys;
                     and weeks of study or of play, group like magic on your quickened vision:—then,
                     a twinge of pain will call again the dreariness, and your head tosses upon the
                     pillow, and your eye searches the gloom vainly for pleasant faces; and your
                     fears brood on that drearier, coming night of Death—far longer, and far more
                     cheerless than this.</p>
                  <p>But even here, the memory of some little prayer you have been taught, which
                     promises a Morning after the Night, comes to your throbbing brain; and its
                     murmur on your fevered lips, as you breathe it, soothes like a caress of
                     angels, and wooes you to smiles and sleep.</p>
                  <p>As the days pass, you grow stronger; and Frank comes in to tell you of the
                     school, and that your old tormentor has been expelled: and you grow into a
                     strong friendship with Frank, and you think of yourselves as a new Damon and
                     Pythias—and that you will some day live together in a fine house, with plenty
                     of horses, and plenty of chestnut trees. Alas, the boy counts little on those
                     later and bitter fates of life, which sever his early friendships, like wisps
                     of straw!</p>
                  <p>At other times, with your eye upon the sleek, trim figure of the Doctor, and
                     upon his huge bunch of watch seals, you think you will some day be a Doctor;
                     and that with a wife and children, and a respectable gig, and gold watch, with
                     seals to match, you would needs be a very happy fellow.</p>
                  <p>And with such fancies drifting on your thought, you count for the hundredth
                     time the figures upon the curtains of your bed,—you trace out the flower
                     wreaths upon the paper-hangings of your room;—your eyes rest idly on the cat
                     playing with the fringe of the curtain;—you see your mother sitting with her
                     needle-work beside the fire;—you watch the sunbeams as they drift along the
                     carpet, from morning until noon; and from noon till night, you watch them
                     playing on the leaves, and dropping spangles on the lawn; and as you watch—you
                     dream.</p>

                  <head type="sub">BOY SENTIMENT.</head>
                  <p>WEEKS, and even years of your boyhood roll on, in the which your dreams are
                     growing wider and grander,—even as the Spring, which I have made the type of
                     the boy-age, is stretching its foliage farther and farther, and dropping longer
                     and heavier shadows on the land.</p>
                  <p>Nelly, that sweet sister, has grown into your heart strangely; and you think
                     that all they write in their books about love, cannot equal your fondness for
                     little Nelly. She is pretty, they say; but what do you care for her prettiness?
                     She is so good, so kind—so watchful of all your wants, so willing to yield to
                     your haughty claims!</p>
                  <p>But, alas, it is only when this sisterly love is lost forever,—only when the
                     inexorable world separates a family and tosses it upon the waves of fate to
                     wide-lying distances—perhaps to graves!—that a man feels, what a boy can never
                     know,—the disinterested and abiding affection of a sister.</p>
                  <p>All this, that I have set down, comes back to you long afterward, when you
                     recal with tears of regret, your reproachful words, or some swift outbreak of
                     passion.</p>
                  <p>Little Madge is a friend of Nelly's—a mischievous, blue-eyed hoyden. They tease
                     you about Madge. You do not of course care one straw for her, but yet it is
                     rather pleasant to be teased thus. Nelly never does this; oh no, not she. I do
                     not know but in the age of childhood, the sister is jealous of the affections
                     of a brother, and would keep his heart wholly at home, until suddenly, and
                     strangely, she finds her own—wandering.</p>
                  <p>But after all, Madge is pretty; and there is something taking in her name. Old
                     people, and very precise people, call her Margaret Boyne. But you do not: it is
                     only plain Madge;—it sounds like her—very rapid and mischievous. It would be
                     the most absurd thing in the world for you to like her, for she teases you in
                     innumerable ways: she laughs at your big shoes; (such a sweet little foot as
                     she has!) and she pins strips of paper on your coat collar; and time and again
                        she<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7259-00000030"/> has worn off your hat in
                     triumph, very well knowing that you, such a quiet body, and so much afraid of
                     her, will never venture upon any liberties with her gipsy bonnet.</p>
                  <p>You sometimes wish, in your vexation, as you see her running, that she would
                     fall and hurt herself badly; but the next moment, it seems a very wicked wish,
                     and you renounce it. Once, she did come very near it. You were all playing
                     together by the big swing—(how plainly it swings in your memory now!)—Madge had
                     the seat, and you were famous for running under with a long push, which Madge
                     liked better than anything else: well, you have half run over the ground, when
                     crash comes the swing, and poor Madge with it! You fairly scream as you catch
                     her up. But she is not hurt—only a cry of fright, and a little sprain of that
                     fairy ancle; and as she brushes away the tears, and those flaxen curls, and
                     breaks into a merry laugh,—half at your woe-worn face, and half in vexation at
                     herself; and leans her hand (such a hand!) upon your shoulder, to limp away
                     into the shade, you dream—your first dream of love.</p>
                  <p>But it is only a dream, not at all acknowledged by you: she is three or four
                     years your junior,—too young altogether. It is very absurd to talk about it.
                     There is nothing to be said of Madge—only—Madge! The name does it.</p>
                  <p>It is rather a pretty name to write. You are fond of making capital M's; and
                     sometimes you follow it with a capital A. Then you practise a little upon a D,
                     and perhaps back it up with a G. Of course it is the merest accident that these
                     letters come together. It seems funny to you—very. And as a proof that they are
                     made at random, you make a T or an R before them, and some other quite
                     irrelevant letters after it.</p>
                  <p>Finally, as a sort of security against all suspicion, you cross it out—cross it
                     a great many ways;—even holding it up to the light, to see that there should be
                     no air of intention about it.</p>
                  <p>——You need have no fear, Clarence, that your hieroglyphics will be studied so
                     closely. Accidental as they are, you are very much more interested in them than
                     any one else!</p>
                  <p>——It is a common fallacy of this dream in most stages of life, that a vast
                     number of persons employ their time chiefly in spying out its operations.</p>
                  <p>Yet Madge cares nothing about you, that you know of. Perhaps it is the very
                     reason, though you do not suspect it then, why you care so much for her. At any
                     rate, she is a friend of Nelly's; and it is your duty not to dislike her. Nelly
                     too, sweet Nelly, gets an inkling of matters; for sisters are very shrewd in
                     suspicions of this sort—shrewder than brothers or fathers; and like<pb
                        n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7259-00000031"/> the good kind girl that she is, she
                     wishes to humor even your weakness.</p>
                  <p>Madge drops in to tea quite often: Nelly has something <emph>in
                        particular</emph> to show her, two or three times a week. Good
                     Nelly,—perhaps she is making your troubles all the greater! You gather large
                     bunches of grapes for Madge—because she is a friend of Nelly's—which she
                     doesn't want at all, and very pretty bouquets, which she either drops, or pulls
                     to pieces.</p>
                  <p>In the presence of your father one day, you drop some hint about Madge, in a
                     very careless way—a way shrewdly calculated to lay all suspicion;—at which your
                     father laughs. This is odd: it makes you wonder if your father was ever in love
                     himself.</p>
                  <p>You rather think that he has been.</p>
                  <p>Madge's father is dead and her mother is poor; and you sometimes dream,
                     how—whatever your father may think or feel—you will some day make a large
                     fortune, in some very easy way, and build a snug cottage, and have one horse
                     for your carriage, and one for your wife, (not Madge, of course—that is absurd)
                     and a turtle shell cat for your wife's mother, and a pretty gate to the front
                     yard, and plenty of shrubbery, and how your wife will come dancing down the
                     path to meet you,—as the Wife does in Mr. Irving's Sketch Book,—and how she
                     will have a harp inside, and will wear white dresses, with a blue sash.</p>
                  <p>——Poor Clarence, it never once occurs to you, that even Madge may grow fat, and
                     wear check aprons, and snuffy-brown dresses of woollen stuff, and twist her
                     hair in yellow papers! Oh no, boyhood has no such dreams as that!</p>
                  <p>I shall leave you here in the middle of your first foray into the world of
                     sentiment, with those wicked blue eyes chasing rainbows over your heart, and
                     those little feet walking every day into your affections. I shall leave you
                     before the affair has ripened into any overtures, and while there is only a
                     sixpence split in halves, and tied about your neck, and Maggie's neck, to bind
                     your destinies together.</p>
                  <p>If I even hinted at any probability of your marrying her, or of your not
                     marrying her, you would be very likely to dispute me. One knows his own
                     feelings, or thinks he does, so much better than any one can tell him!</p>

                  <p>TO visit, is a great thing in the boy calendar:—not to visit this or that
                     neighbor,—to drink tea, or eat strawberries, or play at draughts;—but, to go
                     away on a visit in a coach, with a trunk, and a great-coat, and an
                     umbrella:—this is large!</p>
                  <p>It makes no difference, that they wish to be rid of your noise, now that
                     Charlie is sick of a fever:—the reason is not at all in the way of your pride
                     of visiting. You are to have a long ride in a coach, and eat a dinner at a
                     tavern, and to see a new town almost as large as the one you live in, and you
                     are to make new acquaintances. In short, you are to see the world:—a very proud
                     thing it is, to see the world!</p>
                  <p>As you journey on, after bidding your friends adieu, and as you see fences and
                     houses to which you have not been used, you think them very odd indeed: but it
                     occurs to you, that the geographies speak of very various national
                     characteristics, and you are greatly gratified with this opportunity of
                     verifying your study. You see new crops too, perhaps a broad-leaved tobacco
                     field, which reminds you pleasantly of the luxuriant vegetation of the tropics,
                     spoken of by Peter Parley, and others.</p>
                  <p>As for the houses and barns in the new town, they quite startle you with their
                     strangeness: you observe that some of the latter instead of having one stable
                     door, have five or six, a fact which puzzles you very much indeed. You observe
                     farther, that the houses many of them have balustrades upon the top, which
                     seems to you a very wonderful adaptation to the wants of boys, who wish to fly
                     kites, or to play upon the roof. You notice with special favor, one very low
                     roof which you might climb upon by a mere plank, and you think the boys, whose
                     father lives in that house, are very fortunate boys.</p>
                  <p>Your old aunt, whom you visit, you think wears a very queer cap, being
                     altogether different from that of the old nurse, or of Mrs. Boyne,—Madge's
                     mother. As for the house she lives in, it is quite wonderful. There are such an
                     immense number of closets, and closets within closets, reminding you of the
                        mysteries<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7259-00000033"/> of Rinaldo Rinaldini.
                     Beside which, there are immensely curious bits of old furniture—so black and
                     heavy, and with such curious carving!—and you think of the old wainscot in the
                     Children of the Abbey. You think you will never tire of rambling about in its
                     odd corners, and of what glorious stories you will have to tell of it, when you
                     go back to Nelly, and Charlie.</p>
                  <p>As for acquaintances, you fall in the very first day with a tall boy next door,
                     called Nat. which seems an extraordinary name. Besides, he has travelled; and
                     as he sits with you on the summer nights under the linden trees, he tells you
                     gorgeous stories of the things he has seen. He has made the voyage to London;
                     and he talks about the ship (a real ship) and starboard and larboard, and the
                     spanker, in a way quite surprising; and he takes the stern oar, in the little
                     skiff when you row off in the cove abreast of the town, in a most seaman-like
                     way.</p>
                  <p>He bewilders you too, with his talk about the great bridges of London—London
                     bridge specially, where they sell kids for a penny; which story your new
                     acquaintance, unfortunately, does not confirm. You have read of these bridges,
                     and seen pictures of them in the Wonders of the World; but then Nat. has seen
                     them with his own eyes: he has literally walked over London Bridge, on his own
                     feet! You look at his very shoes in wonderment, and are surprised you do not
                     find some startling difference between those shoes, and your shoes. But there
                     is none—only yours are a trifle stouter in the welt. You think Nat. one of the
                     fortunate boys of this world—born, as your old nurse used to say—with a gold
                     spoon in his mouth.</p>
                  <p>Beside Nat, there is a girl lives over the opposite side of the way, named
                     Jenny, with an eye as black as a coal; and a half a year older than you; but
                     about your height;—whom you fancy amazingly.</p>
                  <p>She has any quantity of toys, that she lets you play with, as if they were your
                     own. And she has an odd, old uncle, who sometimes makes you stand up together,
                     and then marries you after his fashion,—much to the amusement of a grown up
                     house-maid, whenever she gets a peep at the performance. And it makes you
                     somewhat proud to hear her called your wife; and you wonder to yourself,
                     dreamily, if it won't be true some day or other.</p>
                  <p>——Fie, Clarence, where is your split sixpence, and your blue ribbon!</p>
                  <p>Jenny is romantic, and talks of Thaddeus of Warsaw in a very touching manner,
                     and promises to lend you the book. She folds billets in a lover's fashion, and
                     practises love-knots upon her bonnet strings. She looks out of the corners of
                     her eyes very often, and sighs. She is frequently by herself, and pulls flowers
                     to pieces.<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7259-00000034"/> She has great pity for
                     middle-aged bachelors, and thinks them all disappointed men.</p>
                  <p>After a time she writes notes to you, begging you would answer them at the
                     earliest possible moment, and signs herself—'your attached Jenny.' She takes
                     the marriage farce of her uncle in a cold way—as trifling with a very serious
                     subject, and looks tenderly at you. She is very much shocked when her uncle
                     offers to kiss her; and when he proposes it to you, she is equally indignant,
                     but—with a great change of color.</p>
                  <p>Nat. says one day, in a confidential conversation, that it won't do to marry a
                     woman six months older than yourself; and this coming from Nat. who has been to
                     London, rather staggers you. You sometimes think that you would like to marry
                     Madge and Jenny both, if the thing were possible; for Nat. says they sometimes
                     do so the other side of the ocean, though he has never seen it himself.</p>
                  <p>——Ah, Clarence, you will have no such weakness as you grow older: you will find
                     that Providence has charitably, so tempered our affections, that every man of
                     only ordinary nerve will be amply satisfied with a single wife!</p>
                  <p>All this time,—for you are making your visit a very long one, so that autumn
                     has come, and the nights are growing cool, and Jenny and yourself are
                     transferring your little coquetries to the chimney corner;—poor Charlie lies
                     sick, at home. Boyhood, thank Heaven, does not suffer severely from sympathy
                     when the object is remote. And those letters from the mother, telling you that
                     Charlie cannot play,—cannot talk even as he used to do; and that perhaps his
                     'Heavenly Father will take him away, to be with him in the better world,'
                     disturb you for a time only. Sometimes, however, they come back to your thought
                     on a wakeful night, and you dream about his suffering, and think—why it is not
                     you, but Charlie, who is sick? The thought puzzles you; and well it may, for in
                     it lies the whole mystery of our fate.</p>
                  <p>Those letters grow more and more discouraging, and the kind admonitions of your
                     mother grow more earnest, as if (though the thought does not come to you until
                     years afterward) she was preparing herself to fasten upon you, that surplus of
                     affection, which she fears may soon be withdrawn forever from the sick
                     child.</p>
                  <p>It is on a frosty, bleak evening, when you are playing with Nat. that the
                     letter reaches you which says Charlie is growing worse, and that you must come
                     to your home. It makes a dreamy night for you—fancying how Charlie will look,
                     and if sickness has altered him much, and if he will not be well by Christmas.
                     From this, you fall away in your reverie, to the odd old house, and its secret
                     cupboards, and your<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7259-00000035"/> aunt's queer caps:
                     then come up those black eyes of 'your attached Jenny,' and you think it a pity
                     that she is six months older than you; and again—as you recal one of her
                     sighs—you think—that six months are not much after all!</p>
                  <p>You bid her good-bye, with a little sentiment swelling in your throat, and are
                     mortally afraid Nat. will see your lip tremble. Of course you promise to write,
                     and squeeze her hand with an honesty, you do not think of doubting—for
                     weeks.</p>
                  <p>It is a dull, cold ride, that day, for you. The winds sweep over the withered
                     corn-fields, with a harsh, chilly whistle; and the surfaces of the little pools
                     by the road-side are tossed up into cold blue wrinkles of water. Here and there
                     a flock of quail, with their feathers ruffled in the autumn gusts, tread
                     through the hard, dry stubble of an oat-field; or startled by the snap of the
                     driver's whip, they stare a moment at the coach, then whir away down the cold
                     current of the wind. The blue jays scream from the road-side oaks, and the last
                     of the blue and purple asters shiver along the wall. And as the sun sinks,
                     reddening all the western clouds, to the color of the frosted maples,—light
                     lines of the Aurora gush up from the northern hills, and trail their splintered
                     fingers far over the autumn sky.</p>
                  <p>It is quite dark when you reach home, but you see the bright reflection of a
                     fire within, and presently at the open door, Nelly clapping her hands for
                     welcome. But there are sad faces when you enter. Your mother folds you to her
                     heart; but at your first noisy out-burst of joy, puts her finger on her lip,
                     and whispers poor Charlie's name. The Doctor you see too, slipping softly out
                     of the bed-room door with glasses in his hand; and—you hardly know how—your
                     spirits grow sad, and your heart gravitates to the heavy air of all about
                     you.</p>
                  <p>You cannot see Charlie, Nelly says;—and you cannot in the quiet parlor, tell
                     Nelly a single one of the many things, which you had hoped to tell her. She
                     says—'Charlie has grown so thin and so pale, you would never know him.' You
                     listen to her, but you cannot talk: she asks you what you have seen, and you
                     begin, for a moment joyously; but when they open the door of the sick room, and
                     you hear a faint sigh, you cannot go on. You sit still, with your hand in
                     Nelly's, and look thoughtfully into the blaze.</p>
                  <p>You drop to sleep after that day's fatigue, with singular and perplexed fancies
                     haunting you; and when you wake up with a shudder in the middle of the night,
                     you have a fancy that Charlie is really dead: you dream of seeing him pale and
                     thin, as Nelly described him, and with the starched grave clothes on him. You
                     toss over in your bed, and grow hot and feverish. You cannot sleep; and you get
                     up stealthily,<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7259-00000036"/> and creep down stairs;
                     a light is burning in the hall: the bed-room door stands half open, and you
                     listen—fancying you hear a whisper. You steal on through the hall, and edge
                     around the side of the door. A little lamp is flickering on the hearth, and the
                     gaunt shadow of the bedstead lies dark upon the ceiling. Your mother is in her
                     chair, with her head upon her hand—though it is long after midnight. The Doctor
                     is standing with his back toward you, and with Charlie's little wrist in his
                     fingers; and you hear hard breathing, and now and then, a low sigh from your
                     mother's chair.</p>
                  <p>An occasional gleam of fire-light makes the gaunt shadows stagger on the wall,
                     like something spectral. You look wildly at them, and at the bed where your own
                     brother—your laughing, gay-hearted brother, is lying. You long to see him, and
                     sidle up softly a step or two: but your mother's ear has caught the sound, and
                     she beckons you to her, and folds you again in her embrace. You whisper to her
                     what you wish. She rises, and takes you by the hand, to lead you to the
                     bedside.</p>
                  <p>The Doctor looks very solemnly, as we approach. He takes out his watch. He is
                     not counting Charlie's pulse, for he has dropped his hand: and it lies
                     carelessly, but oh, how thin! over the edge of the bed.</p>
                  <p>He shakes his head mournfully at your mother; and she springs forward, dropping
                     your hand, and lays her fingers upon the forehead of the boy, and passes her
                     hand over his mouth.</p>
                  <p>"Is he asleep, Doctor?" she says, in a tone you do not know.</p>
                  <p>"Be calm, madam." The Doctor is very calm.</p>
                  <p>"I am calm," says your mother; but you do not think it, for you see her tremble
                     very plainly.</p>
                  <p>"Dear madam, he will never waken in this world!"</p>
                  <p>There is no cry,—only a bowing down of your mother's head upon the body of
                     poor, dead Charlie!—and only when you see her form shake and quiver with the
                     deep, smothered sobs, your crying bursts forth loud and strong.</p>
                  <p>The Doctor lifts you in his arms, that you may see—that pale head,—those blue
                     eyes all sunken,—that flaxen hair gone,—those white lips pinched and
                     hard!——Never, never, will the boy forget his first terrible sight of Death!</p>
                  <p>In your silent chamber, after the storm of sobs has wearied you, the boy-dreams
                     are strange and earnest. They take hold on that awful Visitant,—that strange
                     slipping away from life, of which we know so little, and yet know, alas, so
                     much! Charlie that was your brother, is now only a name: perhaps he is an
                     angel: perhaps (for the old nurse has said it, when he was ugly—and now, you
                     hate her for it) he is with Satan.</p>
                  <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7259-00000037"/>
                  <p>But you are sure this cannot be: you are sure that God who made him suffer,
                     would not now quicken, and multiply his suffering. It agrees with your religion
                     to think so; and just now, you want your religion to help you all it can.</p>
                  <p>You toss in your bed, thinking over and over of that strange thing——Death:—and
                     that perhaps it may overtake you, before you are a man; and you sob out those
                     prayers (you scarce know why) which ask God to keep life in you. You think the
                     involuntary fear that makes your little prayer full of sobs, is a holy
                     feeling:—and so it is a holy feeling—the same feeling which makes a stricken
                     child, yearn for the embrace, and the protection of a Parent. But you will find
                     there are those canting ones, trying to persuade you at a later day, that it is
                     a mere animal fear, and not to be cherished.</p>
                  <p>You feel an access of goodness growing out of your boyish grief: you feel
                     right-minded: it seems as if your little brother in going to Heaven, had opened
                     a pathway thither, down which, goodness comes streaming over your soul.</p>
                  <p>You think how good a life you will lead; and you map out great purposes,
                     spreading themselves over the school-weeks of your remaining boyhood; and you
                     love your friends, or seem to, far more dearly than you ever loved them before;
                     and you forgive the boy who provoked you to that sad fall from the oaks, and
                     you forgive him all his wearisome teasings. But you cannot forgive yourself for
                     some harsh words that you have once spoken to Charlie: still less can you
                     forgive yourself for having once struck him, in passion, with your fist. You
                     cannot forget his sobs then:——if he were only alive one little instant, to let
                     you say,—"Charlie, will you forgive me?"</p>
                  <p>Yourself, you cannot forgive; and sobbing over it, and murmuring "Dear—dear
                     Charlie!"—you drop into a troubled sleep.</p>

                  <p>IS any weak soul frightened, that I should write of the Religion of the boy?
                     How indeed could I cover the field of his moral, or intellectual growth, if I
                     left unnoticed those dreams of futurity and of goodness, which come sometimes
                     to his quieter moments, and oftener, to his hours of vexation and trouble? It
                     would be as wise to describe the season of Spring, with no note of the silent
                     influences of that burning Day-god, which is melting day by day the shattered
                     ice-drifts of Winter;—which is filling every bud with succulence, and painting
                     one flower with crimson, and another with white.</p>
                  <p>I know there is a feeling—by much too general as it seems to me,—that the
                     subject may not be approached, except through the dicta of certain ecclesiastic
                     bodies;—and that the language which touches it, must not be that every-day
                     language which mirrors the vitality of our thought,—but should have some twist
                     of that theologic mannerism, which is as cold to the boy, as to the busy man of
                     the world.</p>
                  <p>I know very well that a great many good souls will call levity, what I call
                     honesty; and will abjure that familiar handling of the boy's lien upon
                     Eternity, which my story will show. But I shall feel sure that in keeping true
                     to Nature with word and with thought, I shall in no way offend against those
                     Highest truths, to which all truthfulness is kindred.</p>
                  <p>You have Christian teachers, who speak always reverently of the Bible: you grow
                     up in the hearing of daily prayers: nay, you are perhaps taught to say
                     them.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes they have a meaning, and sometimes they have none. They have a
                     meaning, when your heart is troubled,—when a grief or a wrong weighs upon you:
                     then, the keeping of the Father, which you implore, seems to come from the
                     bottom of your soul; and your eye suffuses with such tears of feeling, as you
                     count holy, and as you love to cherish in your memory.</p>
                  <p>But, they have no meaning, when some trifling vexation angers you, and a
                     distaste for all about you, breeds a distaste for all above you. In the long
                        hours<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7259-00000039"/> of toilsome days, little
                     thought comes over you of the morning prayer; and only when evening deepens its
                     shadows, and your boyish vexations fatigue you to thoughtfulness, do you dream
                     of that coming, and endless night, to which,—they tell you,—prayers soften the
                     way.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes upon a Summer Sunday, when you are wakeful upon your seat in church,
                     with some strong-worded preacher, who says things that half fright you, it
                     occurs to you to consider how much goodness you are made of; and whether there
                     be enough of it after all, to carry you safely away from the clutch of Evil?
                     And straightway you reckon up those friendships where your heart lies: you know
                     you are a true and honest friend to Frank; and you love your mother, and your
                     father: as for Nelly, Heaven knows, you could not contrive a way to love her
                     better than you do.</p>
                  <p>You dare not take much credit to yourself for the love of little Madge:—partly
                     because you have sometimes caught yourself trying—not to love her: and partly
                     because the black-eyed Jenny comes in the way. Yet you can find no command in
                     the Catechism, to love one girl to the exclusion of all other girls. It is
                     somewhat doubtful if you ever do find it. But, as for loving some half dozen
                     you could name, whose images drift through your thought, in dirty,
                     salmon-colored frocks, and slovenly shoes, it is quite impossible; and suddenly
                     this thought, coupled with a lingering remembrance of the pea-green pantaloons,
                     utterly breaks down your hopes.</p>
                  <p>Yet, you muse again,—there are plenty of good people as the times go, who have
                     their dislikes, and who speak them too. Even the sharp-talking clergy-man, you
                     have heard say some very sour things about his landlord, who raised his rent
                     the last year. And you know that he did not talk as mildly as he does in the
                     Church, when he found Frank and yourself quietly filching a few of his peaches,
                     through the orchard fence.</p>
                  <p>But your clergyman will say perhaps, with what seems to you, quite unnecessary
                     coldness, that goodness is not to be reckoned in your chances of safety;—that
                     there is a Higher Goodness, whose merit is All-Sufficient. This puzzles you
                     sadly; nor will you escape the puzzle, until in the presence of the Home altar,
                     which seems to guard you, as the Lares guarded Roman children, you
                        <emph>fed</emph>—you cannot tell how,—that good actions must spring from
                     good sources; and that those sources must lie in that Heaven, toward which your
                     boyish spirit yearns, as you kneel at your mother's side.</p>
                  <p>Conscience too, is all the while approving you for deeds well done; and,—wicked
                     as you fear the preacher might judge it,—you cannot but found on these
                        deeds,<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7259-00000040"/> a hope that your prayer at
                     night flows more easily, more freely, and more holily toward "Our Father in
                     Heaven." Nor indeed, later in life,—whatever may be the ill-advised expressions
                     of human teachers—will you ever find that <emph>Duty performed,</emph> and
                        <emph>generous endeavor</emph> will stand one whit in the way either of
                     Faith, or of Love. Striving to be good, is a very direct road toward Goodness;
                     and if life be so tempered by high motive, as to make actions always good,
                     Faith is unconsciously won.</p>
                  <p>Another notion that disturbs you very much, is your positive dislike of long
                     sermons, and of such singing as they have when the organist is away. You cannot
                     get the force of that verse of Dr. Watts which likens heaven to a never-ending
                     Sabbath; you <emph>do</emph> hope—though it seems a half wicked hope—that old
                     Dr. ——, will not be the preacher. You think that your heart in its best
                     moments, craves for something more lovable. You suggest this perhaps to some
                     Sunday teacher, who only shakes his head sourly, and tells you it is a thought
                     that the Devil is putting in your brain. It strikes you oddly that the Devil
                     should be using a verse of Dr. Watts to puzzle you! But if it be so, he keeps
                     it sticking by your thought very pertinaciously, until some simple utterance of
                     your mother about the Love that reigns in the other world, seems on a sudden to
                     widen Heaven, and to waft away your doubts like a cloud.</p>
                  <p>It excites your wonder not a little, to find people who talk gravely and
                     heartily of the excellence of sermons and of Church-going, do sometimes fall
                     asleep under it all. And you wonder—if they really like preaching so well,—why
                     they do not buy some of the minister's old manuscripts, and read them over on
                     week-days;—or, invite the Clergyman to preach to them in a quiet way in
                     private?</p>
                  <p>——Ah, Clarence, you do not yet know the poor weakness of even maturest manhood,
                     and the feeble gropings of the soul toward a soul's paradise, in the best of
                     the world! You do not yet know either that ignorance and fear will be thrusting
                     their untruth and false show into the very essentials of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Again, you wonder,—if the Clergymen are all such very good men as you are
                     taught to believe, why it is, that every little while people will be trying to
                     send them off; and very anxious to prove that instead of being so good, they
                     are in fact, very stupid and bad men. At that day, you have no clear
                     conceptions of the distinction between stupidity and vice; and think that a
                     good man must necessarily say very eloquent things. You will find yourself
                     sadly mistaken on this point, before you get on very far in life.</p>
                  <p>Heaven, when your mother peoples it with friends<pb n="80-81"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000041"/> gone, and little Charlie, and that better
                     Friend, who, she says, took Charlie in his arms, and is now his Father, above
                     the skies, seems a place to be loved, and longed for. But—to think that Mr.
                     Such-an-one, who is only good on Sundays, will be there too; and to think of
                     his talking as he does, of a place which you are sure he would spoil if he were
                     there,—puzzles you again; and you relapse into wonder, doubt and yearning.</p>
                  <p>——And there, Clarence, for the present I shall leave you. A wide, rich Heaven
                     hangs above you, but it hangs very high. A wide, rough world is around you, and
                     it lies very low!</p>
                  <p>I am assuming in these sketches no office of a teacher. I am seeking only to
                     make a truthful analysis of the boyish thought and feeling. But having ventured
                     thus far into what may seem sacred ground, I shall venture still farther, and
                     clinch my matter with a moral.</p>
                  <p>There is very much Religious teaching, even in so good a country as New
                     England, which is far too harsh, too dry, too cold for the heart of a boy. Long
                     sermons, doctrinal precepts, and such tediously-worded dogmas as were uttered
                     by those honest, but hard-spoken men—the Westminster Divines, fatigue, and
                     puzzle, and dispirit him.</p>
                  <p>They may be well enough for those strong souls which strengthen by task-work,
                     or for those mature people whose iron habit of self-denial has made patience a
                     cardinal virtue; but they fall (<foreign xml:lang="LAT">experto
                     crede</foreign>) upon the unfledged faculties of the boy, like a winter's rain
                     upon Spring flowers,—like hammers of iron upon lithe timber. They may make deep
                     impression upon his moral nature, but there is great danger of a sad
                     rebound.</p>
                  <p>Is it absurd to suppose that some adaptation is desirable? And might not the
                     teachings of that Religion, which is the Ægis of our moral being, be inwrought
                     with some of those finer harmonies of speech and form—which were given to wise
                     ends;—and lure the boyish soul, by something akin to that gentleness, which
                     belonged to the Nazarene Teacher; and which provided—not only, meat for men,
                     but "milk for babes?"</p>

                  <head>VI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A NEW ENGLAND SQUIRE.</head>
                  <p>FRANK has a grandfather living in the country, a good specimen of the old
                     fashioned New England farmer. And—go where one will, the world over—I know of
                     no race of men, who taken together, possess more integrity, more intelligence,
                     and more of those elements of comfort, which go to make a home beloved, and the
                     social basis firm, than the New England farmers.</p>
                  <p>They are not brilliant, nor are they highly refined; they know nothing of arts,
                     histrionic or dramatic; they know only so much of older nations as their
                     histories and newspapers teach them; in the fashionable world they hold no
                     place;—but in energy, in industry, in hardy virtue, in substantial knowledge,
                     and in manly independence, they make up a race, that is hard to be matched.</p>
                  <p>The French peasantry are, in all the essentials of intelligence, and sterling
                     worth, infants, compared with them: and the farmers of England are either the
                     merest jockeys in grain, with few ideas beyond their sacks, samples, and
                     market-days;—or, with added cultivation, they lose their independence in a
                     subserviency to some neighbor patron of rank; and superior intelligence teaches
                     them no lesson so quickly, as that their brethren of the glebe are unequal to
                     them, and are to be left to their cattle and the goad.</p>
                  <p>There are English farmers indeed, who are men in earnest, who read the papers,
                     and who keep the current of the year's intelligence; but such men are the
                     exceptions. In New England, with the school upon every third hill-side, and the
                     self-regulating, free-acting church, to watch every valley with week-day quiet,
                     and to wake every valley with Sabbath sound, the men become as a class, bold,
                     intelligent, and honest actors, who would make again, as they have made before,
                     a terrible army of defence; and who would find reasons for their actions, as
                     strong as their armies.</p>
                  <p>Frank's grandfather has silver hair, but is still hale, erect, and strong. His
                     dress is homely, but neat. Being a thorough-going Protectionist, he has no
                        fancy<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7259-00000043"/> for the gew-gaws of foreign
                     importation, and makes it a point to appear always in the village church, and
                     on all great occasions, in a sober suit of homespun. He has no pride of
                     appearance, and he needs none. He is known as the Squire, throughout the
                     township; and no important measure can pass the board of select-men without the
                     Squire's approval:—and this, from no blind subserviency to his opinion, because
                     his farm is large, and he is reckoned "fore-handed," but because there is a
                     confidence in his judgment.</p>
                  <p>He is jealous of none of the prerogatives of the country parson, or of the
                     school-master, or of the Village doctor; and although the latter is a testy
                     politician of the opposite party, it does not at all impair the Squire's faith
                     in his calomel;—he suffers all his Radicalism, with the same equanimity that he
                     suffers his rhubarb.</p>
                  <p>The day-laborers of the neighborhood, and the small farmers consider the
                     Squire's note of hand for their savings, better than the best bonds of city
                     origin; and they seek his advice is all matters of litigation. He is a Justice
                     of the Peace, as the title of Squire in a New England village implies; and many
                     are the country courts that you peep upon, with Frank, from the door of the
                     great dining room.</p>
                  <p>The defendant always seems to you, in these important cases,—especially if his
                     beard is rather long,—an extraordinary ruffian; to whom Jack Sheppard would
                     have been a comparatively innocent boy. You watch curiously the old gentleman,
                     sitting in his big arm chair, with his spectacles in their silver case at his
                     elbow, and his snuff box in hand, listening attentively to some grievous
                     complaint; you see him ponder deeply—with a pinch of snuff to aid his
                     judgment,—and you listen with intense admiration, as he gives a loud,
                     preparatory "Ahem," and clears away the intricacies of the case with a sweep of
                     that strong practical sense, which distinguishes the New England
                     farmer,—getting at the very hinge of the matter, without any consciousness of
                     his own precision, and satisfying the defendant by the clearness of his talk,
                     as much as by the leniency of his judgment.</p>
                  <p>His lands lie along those swelling hills which in southern New England, carry
                     the chain of the White and Green Mountains, in gentle undulations, to the
                     borders of the sea. He farms some fifteen hundred acres,—"suitably divided," as
                     the old school agriculturists say, into "wood-land, pasture, and tillage." The
                     farm-house, a large irregularly built mansion of wood, stands upon a shelf of
                     the hills looking southward, and is shaded by century-old oaks. The barns and
                     out-buildings are grouped in a brown phalanx, a little to the northward of the
                     dwelling. Between them<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7259-00000044"/> a high timber
                     gate, opens upon the scattered pasture lands of the hills: opposite to this,
                     and across the farm-yard which is the lounging place of scores of red-necked
                     turkeys, and of matronly hens, clucking to their callow brood, another gate of
                     similar pretensions opens upon the wide meadow land, which rolls with a heavy
                     "ground swell," along the valley of a mountain river. A veteran oak stands
                     sentinel at the brown meadow-gate, its trunk all scarred with the ruthless cuts
                     of new-ground axes, and the limbs garnished in summer time, with the crooked
                     snathes of murderous-looking scythes.</p>
                  <p>The high-road passes a stone's throw away; but there is little "travel" to be
                     seen; and every chance passer will inevitably come under the range of the
                     kitchen windows, and be studied carefully by the eyes of the stout
                     dairy-maid:—to say nothing of the stalwart Indian cook.</p>
                  <p>This last, you cannot but admire as a type of that noble old race, among whom
                     your boyish fancy has woven so many stories of romance. You wonder how she must
                     regard the white interlopers upon her own soil; and you think that she
                     tolerates the Squire's farming privileges, with more modesty than you would
                     suppose. You learn, however, that she pays very little regard to white
                     rights,—when they conflict with her own; and further learn, to your deep
                     regret, that your Princess of the old tribe, is sadly addicted to cider
                     drinking: and having heard her once or twice, with a very indistinct "Goo-er
                     night Sq-quare," upon her lips—your dreams about her, grow very tame.</p>
                  <p>The Squire, like all very sensible men, has his hobbies, and peculiarities. He
                     has a great contempt, for instance, for all paper money; and imagines banks to
                     be corporate societies, skillfully contrived for the legal plunder of the
                     community. He keeps a supply of silver and gold by him, in the foot of an old
                     stocking; and seems to have great confidence in the value of Spanish milled
                     dollars. He has no kind of patience with the new doctrines of farming. Liebig,
                     and all the rest, he sets down as mere theorists; and has far more respect for
                     the contents of his barn-yard, than for all the guano deposits in the world.
                     Scientific farming, and gentleman farming, may do very well, he says, 'to keep
                     idle young fellows from the City out of mischief; but as for real, effective
                     management, there's nothing like the old stock of men, who ran barefoot until
                     they were ten, and who count the hard winters by their frozen toes.' And he is
                     fond of quoting in this connection,—the only quotation by the by, that the old
                     gentleman ever makes—that couplet of Poor Richard:—<pb n="88-89"

                  <p>The Squire has been in his day, connected more or less intimately with
                     Turn-pike enterprise, which the rail-roads of the day have thrown sadly into
                     the background; and he reflects often, in a melancholy way, upon the good old
                     times when a man could travel in his own carriage quietly across the country,
                     without being frightened with the clatter of an engine;—and when Turn-pike
                     stock, paid wholesome yearly dividends of six per cent.</p>
                  <p>An almost constant hanger-on about the premises, and a great favorite with the
                     Squire, is a stout, middle-aged man, with a heavy bearded face—to whom Frank
                     introduces you, as "Captain Dick"; and he tells you moreover, that he is a
                     better butcher,—a better wall layer, and cuts a broader "swathe," than any man
                     upon the farm. Beside all which, he has an immense deal of information. He
                     knows, in the Spring, where all the crows' nests are to be found; he tells
                     Frank where the foxes burrow; he has even shot two or three raccoons in the
                     swamps; he knows the best season to troll for pickerel; he has a thorough
                     understanding of bee-hunting; he can tell the ownership of every stray heifer
                     that appears upon the road: indeed, scarce an inquiry is made, or an opinion
                     formed, on any of these subjects, or on such kindred ones as the weather, or
                     potato crop, without previous consultation with "Captain Dick."</p>
                  <p>You have an extraordinary respect for Captain Dick: his gruff tones, dark
                     beard, patched waist-coat, and cow-hide boots, only add to it: you can compare
                     your regard for him, only with the sentiments you entertain for those fabulous
                     Roman heroes, led on by Horatius, who cut down the bridge across the Tiber, and
                     then swam over to their wives and families!</p>
                  <p>A superannuated old greyhound lives about the premises, and stalks lazily
                     around, thrusting his thin nose into your hands, in a very affectionate
                     manner.</p>
                  <p>Of course, in your way, you are a lion among the boys of the neighborhood: a
                     blue jacket that you wear, with bell buttons of white metal, is their especial
                     wonderment. You astonish them, moreover, with your stories of various parts of
                     the world which they have never visited. They tell you of the haunts of
                     rabbits, and great snake stories, as you sit in the dusk after supper, under
                     the old oaks; and you delight them in turn, with some marvellous tale of South
                     American reptiles, out of Peter Parley's books.</p>
                  <p>In all this, your new friends are men of observation; while Frank and yourself,
                     are comparatively men of reading. In ciphering, and all schooling, you find<pb
                        n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7259-00000046"/> yourself a long way before them; and
                     you talk of problems, and foreign seas, and Latin declensions, in a way that
                     sets them all agape.</p>
                  <p>As for the little country girls, their bare legs rather stagger your notions of
                     propriety; nor can you wholly get over their outside pronunciation of some of
                     the vowels. Frank, however, has a little cousin,—a toddling, wee thing, some
                     seven years your junior, who has a rich eye for an infant. But, alas, its color
                     means nothing; poor Fanny is stone blind! Your pity leans toward her strangely,
                     as she feels her way about the old parlor; and her dark eyes wander over the
                     wainscot, or over the clear, blue sky—with the same, sad, painful vacancy.</p>
                  <p>And yet—it is very strange!—she does not grieve: there is a sweet, soft smile
                     upon her lip,—a smile that will come to you in your fancied troubles of after
                     life, with a deep voice of reproach.</p>
                  <p>Altogether, you grow into a liking of the country: your boyish spirit loves its
                     fresh, bracing air, and the sparkles of dew, that at sunrise cover the hills
                     with diamonds;—and the wild river, with its black-topped, loitering pools;—and
                     the shaggy mists that lie, in the nights of early autumn, like unravelled
                     clouds, lost upon the meadow. You love the hills climbing green and grand to
                     the skies; or stretching away in distance, their soft, blue, smoky caps,—like
                     the sweet, half-faded memories of the years behind you. You love those oaks
                     tossing up their broad arms into clear heaven, with a spirit and a strength,
                     that kindles your dawning pride and purposes; and that makes you yearn, as you
                     forehead mantles with fresh blood, for a kindred spirit, and a kindred
                     strength. Above all, you love—though you do not know it now—the BREADTH of a
                     country life. In the fields of God's planting, there is ROOM. No walls of brick
                     and mortar cramp one: no factitious distinctions mould your habit. The
                     involuntary reaches of the spirit, tend toward the True, and the Natural. The
                     flowers, the clouds, and the fresh-smelling earth, all give width to your
                     intent. The boy grows into manliness, instead of growing to be like men. He
                     claims,—with tears almost, of brotherhood,—his kinship with Nature; and he
                     feels, in the mountains, his heir-ship to the Father of Nature!</p>
                  <p>This delirium of feeling may not find expression upon the lip of the boy; but
                     yet it underlies his thought, and will, without his consciousness, give the
                     spring to his musing dreams.</p>
                  <p>——So it is, that as you lie there upon the sunny greensward, at the old
                     Squire's door, you muse upon the time when some rich lying land, with huge
                     granaries, and cozy old mansion sleeping under the trees, shall be yours;—when
                     the brooks shall water your meadows, and come laughing down your pasture<pb
                        n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7259-00000047"/> lands;—when the clouds shall shed
                     their spring fragrance upon your lawns, and the daisies bless your paths.</p>
                  <p>You will then be a Squire, with your cane, your lean-limbed hound, your
                     stocking-leg of specie, and your snuff-box. You will be the happy, and
                     respected husband of some tidy old lady in black, and spectacles,—a little
                     phthisicky, like Frank's grandmother,—and an accomplished cook of stewed pears,
                     and Johnny cakes!</p>
                  <p>It seems a very lofty ambition, at this stage of growth, to reach such
                     eminence, as to convert your drawer in the wainscot, that has a secret spring,
                     into a bank for the country people; and the power to send a man to jail, seems
                     one of those stretches of human prerogative, to which few of your fellow
                     mortals can ever hope to attain.</p>
                  <p>——Well, it may all be. And who knows but the Dreams of Age, when they are
                     reached, will be lighted by the same spirit and freedom of nature, that is
                     around you now? Who knows, but that after tracking you through the Spring, and
                     the Summer of Youth, we shall find frosted Age settling upon you heavily, and
                     solemnly, in the very fields where you wanton to-day?</p>
                  <p>This American life of ours is a tortuous and shifting impulse. It brings Age
                     back, from years of wandering, to totter in the hamlet of its birth; and it
                     scatters armies of ripe manhood, to bleach far-away shores with their
                     bones.</p>
                  <p>That Providence, whose eye and hand are the spy and the executioner of the
                     Fateful changes of our life, may bring you back in Manhood, or in Age, to this
                     mountain home of New England; and that very willow yonder, which your fancy now
                     makes the graceful mourner of your leave, may one day shadow mournfully your
                     grave!</p>

                  <head>VII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE COUNTRY CHURCH.</head>
                  <p>THE country church is a square old building of wood, without paint or
                     decoration—and of that genuine, Puritanic stamp, which is now fast giving way
                     to Greek porticos, and to cockney towers. It stands upon a hill with a little
                     church yard in its rear, where one or two sickly looking trees keep watch and
                     ward over the vagrant sheep that graze among the graves. Bramble bushes seem to
                     thrive on the bodies below, and there is no flower in the little yard, save a
                     few golden rods, which flaunt their gaudy inodorous color under the lee of the
                     northern wall.</p>
                  <p>New England country-livers have as yet been very little innoculated with the
                     sentiment of beauty; even the door-step to the church is a wide flat stone,
                     that shows not a single stroke of the hammer. Within, the simplicity is even
                     more severe. Brown galleries run around three sides of the old building,
                     supported by timbers, on which you still trace, under the stains from the leaky
                     roof, the deep scoring of the woodman's axe.</p>
                  <p>Below, the unpainted pews are ranged in square forms, and by age, have gained
                     the color of those fragmentary wrecks of cigar boxes, which you see upon the
                     top shelves, in the bar-rooms of country taverns. The minister's desk is lofty,
                     and has once been honored with a coating of paint;—as well as the huge
                     sounding-board, which, to your great amazement, protrudes from the wall, at a
                     very dangerous angle of inclination, over the speaker's head. As the Squire's
                     pew is the place of honor, to the right of the pulpit, you have a little tremor
                     yourself, at sight of the heavy sounding-board, and cannot forbear indulging in
                     a quiet feeling of relief, when the last prayer is said.</p>
                  <p>There are in the Squire's pew, long, faded, crimson cushions; which, it seems
                     to you, must date back nearly to the commencement of the Christian era in this
                     country. There are also sundry old thumb-worn copies of Dr. Dwight's Version of
                     the Psalms of David—'appointed to be sung in churches, by authority of the
                     General Association of the State of Connecticut.' The sides of Dr. Dwight's
                     Version are, you observe, sadly warped, and weather-stained; and from some<pb
                        n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7259-00000049"/> stray figures which appear upon a
                     fly-leaf, you are constrained to think, that the Squire has sometime employed a
                     quiet interval of the service, with reckoning up the contents of the old
                     stocking-leg at home.</p>
                  <p>The parson is a stout man, remarkable in your opinion, chiefly, for a
                     yellowish-brown wig, a strong nasal tone, and occasional violent thumps upon
                     the little, dingy, red velvet cushion, studded with brass tacks, at the top of
                     the desk. You do not altogether admire his style; and by the time he has
                     entered upon his 'Fourthly,' you give your attention, in despair, to a new
                     reading (it must be the twentieth) of the preface to Dr. Dwight's Version of
                     the Psalms.</p>
                  <p>The singing has a charm for you. There is a long, thin-faced, flax-haired man,
                     who carries a tuning fork in his waistcoat pocket, and who leads the choir. His
                     position is in the very front rank of gallery benches, facing the desk; and by
                     the time the old clergyman has read two verses of the psalm, the country
                     chorister turns around to his little group of aids—consisting of the
                     blacksmith, a carroty headed school-master, two women in snuff-colored silks,
                     and a girl in pink bonnet—to announce the tune.</p>
                  <p>This being done in an authoritative manner, he lifts his long music
                     book,—glances again at his little company,—clears his throat by a powerful
                     ahem, followed by a powerful use of a bandanna pocket-handkerchief,— draws out
                     his tuning fork, and waits for the parson to close his reading. He now reviews
                     once more his company,—throws a reproving glance at the young woman in the pink
                     hat, who at the moment is biting off a stout bunch of fennel,—lifts his music
                     book,—thumps upon the rail with his fork,—listens keenly,—gives a slight
                        <emph>ahem,</emph>—falls into the cadence,—swells into a strong <foreign
                        xml:lang="ITA">crescendo,</foreign>—catches at the first word of the line,
                     as if he were afraid it might get away,—turns to his company,—lifts his music
                     book with spirit,—gives it a powerful slap with the disengaged hand, and with a
                     majestic toss of the head, soars away, with half the women below straggling on
                     in his wake, into some such brave, old melody as——LITCHFIELD!</p>
                  <p>Being a visitor, and in the Squire's pew, you are naturally an object of
                     considerable attention to the girls about your age; as well as to a great many
                     fat, old ladies in iron spectacles, who mortify you excessively, by patting you
                     under the chin after church; and insist upon mistaking you for Frank; and force
                     upon you very dry cookies, spiced with caraway seeds.</p>
                  <p>You keep somewhat shy of the young ladies, as they are rather stout for your
                     notions of beauty; and wear thick calf-skin boots. They compare very poorly
                     with Jenny. Jenny, you think, would be above eating gingerbread between
                     service. None of them, you imagine, even read Thaddeus of Warsaw, or ever
                        used<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7259-00000050"/> a colored glass seal with a
                     heart upon it. You are quite certain they never did, or they could not, surely,
                     wear such dowdy gowns, and suck their thumbs as they do!</p>
                  <p>The farmers you have a high respect for;—particularly for one weazen-faced old
                     gentleman in a brown surtout, who brings his whip into church with him, who
                     sings in a very strong voice, and who drives a span of gray colts. You think,
                     however, that he has got rather a stout wife; and from the way he humors her in
                     stopping to talk with two or three other fat women, before setting off for
                     home, (though he seems a little fidgetty) you naively think, that he has a high
                     regard for her opinion. Another townsman, who attracts your notice, is a stout
                     old deacon, who before entering, always steps around the corner of the church,
                     and puts his hat upon the ground, to adjust his wig in a quiet way. He then
                     marches up the broad aisle in a stately manner, and plants his hat, and a big
                     pair of buckskin mittens, on the little table under the desk. When he is fairly
                     seated in his corner of the pew, with his elbow upon the top-rail—almost the
                     only man who can comfortably reach it,—you observe that he spreads his brawny
                     fingers over his scalp, in an exceedingly cautious manner; and you innocently
                     think again, that it is very hypocritical in a Deacon, to be pretending to lean
                     upon his hand, when he is only keeping his wig straight.</p>
                  <p>After the morning service, they have an 'hour's intermission,' as the preacher
                     calls it; during which, the old men gather on a sunny side of the building, and
                     after shaking hands all around, and asking after the 'folks' at home, they
                     enjoy a quiet talk about the crops. One man for instance, with a twist in his
                     nose, would say, 'it's raether a growin' season;' and another would
                     reply—'tolerable, but potatoes is feelin' the wet, badly.' The stout deacon
                     approves this opinion, and confirms it, by blowing his nose very
                     powerfully.</p>
                  <p>Two or three of the more worldly minded ones, will perhaps stroll over to a
                     neighbor's barn-yard, and take a look at his young stock, and talk of prices,
                     and whittle a little; and very likely some two of them, will make a conditional
                     'swop' of 'three likely yer'lings' for a pair of 'two-year-olds.'</p>
                  <p>The youngsters are fond of getting out into the grave-yard, and comparing
                     jack-knives, or talking about the school-master, or the menagerie;—or, it may
                     be, of some prospective 'travel' in the fall,—either to town, or perhaps to the
                     'sea-shore.'</p>
                  <p>Afternoon service hangs heavily; and the tall chorister is by no means so
                     blithe, or so majestic in the toss of his head, as in the morning. A boy in the
                     next box, tries to provoke you into familiarity by dropping pellets of
                     gingerbread through the bars of the pew; but as<pb n="100-101"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000051"/> you are not accustomed to that way of making
                     acquaintance, you decline all overtures.</p>
                  <p>After the service is finished, the wagons that have been disposed on either
                     side of the road, are drawn up before the door. The old Squire meantime, is
                     sure to have a little chat with the parson before he leaves; in the course of
                     which, the parson takes occasion to say that his wife is a little ailing—'a
                     slight touch,' he thinks, 'of the rheumatiz.' One of the children too, has been
                     troubled with the 'summer complaint' for a day or two; but he thinks that a
                     dose of catnip, under Providence, will effect a cure. The younger, and
                     unmarried men, with red wagons, flaming upon bright, yellow wheels, make great
                     efforts to drive off in the van; and they spin frightfully near some of the
                     fat, sour-faced women, who remark in a quiet, but not very Christian tone, that
                     'they fear the elder's sermon hasn't done the young bucks much good.' It is
                     much to be feared, in truth, that it has not.</p>
                  <p>In ten minutes the old church is thoroughly deserted; the neighbor who keeps
                     the key has locked up for another week, the creaking door; and nothing of the
                     service remains within, except—Dr. Dwight's version,—the long music
                     books,—crumbs of gingerbread, and refuse stalks of despoiled fennel.</p>
                  <p>And yet, under the influence of that old weather-stained temple, are perhaps
                     growing up—though you do not once fancy it—souls, possessed of an energy, an
                     industry, and a respect for virtue, which will make them stronger for the real
                     work of life, than all the elegant children of a city. One lesson, which even
                     the rudest churches of New England teach,—with all their harshness, and all
                     their repulsive severity of form—is the lesson of SELF-DENIAL. Once armed with
                     that, and manhood is strong. The soul that possesses the consciousness of
                     mastering passion, is endowed with an element of force, that can never
                     harmonize with defeat. Difficulties, it wears like a summer garment, and flings
                     away, at the first approach of the winter of NEED.</p>
                  <p>Let not any one suppose then, that in this detail of the country life, through
                     which our hero is led, I would cast obloquy, or a sneer, upon its simplicity,
                     or upon its lack of refinement. Goodness, and strength, in this world, are
                     quite as apt to wear rough coats, as fine ones. And the words of thorough, and
                     self-sacrificing kindness, are far more often dressed in the uncouth sounds of
                     retired life, than in the polished utterance of the town. Heaven has not made
                     warm hearts, and honest hearts distinguishable by the quality of the covering.
                     True diamonds need no work of the artificer to reflect, and multiply their
                     rays. Goodness is more within, than without; and purity is of nearer kin to the
                     soul, than to the body.</p>

                  <p>——And, Clarence, it may well happen, that later in life—under the gorgeous
                     ceilings of Venetian churches, or at some splendid mass of Notre Dame, with
                     embroidered coats, and costly silks around you,—your thoughts will run back to
                     that little storm-beaten church, and to the willow waving in its yard—with a
                     Hope that <emph>glows;</emph>—and with a tear, that you embalm!</p>

                  <head>VIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A HOME SCENE.</head>
                  <p>AND now I shall not leave this realm of boyhood, or suffer my hero to slip away
                     from this gala time of his life, without a fair look at that Home where his
                     present pleasures lie, and where all his dreams begin and end.</p>
                  <p>Little does the boy know, as the tide of years drifts by, floating him out
                     insensibly from the harbor of his home, upon the great sea of life,—what joys,
                     what opportunities, what affections, are slipping from him into the shades of
                     that inexorable Past, where no man can go, save on the wings of his dreams.
                     Little does he think—and God be praised, that the thought does not sink deep
                     lines in his young forehead!—as he leans upon the lap of his mother, with his
                     eye turned to her,<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7259-00000053"/> in some earnest
                     pleading for a fancied pleasure of the hour, or in some important story of his
                     griefs, that such sharing of his sorrows, and such sympathy with his wishes, he
                     will find no where again.</p>
                  <p>Little does he imagine, that the fond Nelly, ever thoughtful of his pleasure,
                     ever smiling away his griefs—will soon be beyond the reach of either; and that
                     the waves of the years which come rocking so gently under him, will soon toss
                     her far away, upon the great swell of life.</p>
                  <p>But <emph>now,</emph> you are there. The fire-light glimmers upon the walls of
                     your cherished home, like the Vestal fire of old upon the figures of adoring
                     virgins, or like the flame of Hebrew sacrifice, whose incense bore hearts to
                     Heaven. The big chair of your father is drawn to its wonted corner by the
                     chimney side; his head, just touched with gray, lies back upon its oaken top.
                     Little Nelly leans upon his knee, looking up for some reply to her girlish
                     questionings. Opposite, sits your mother; her figure is thin, her look
                     cheerful, yet subdued;—her arm perhaps resting on your shoulder, as she talks
                     to you in tones of tender admonition, of the days that are to come.</p>
                  <p>The cat is purring on the hearth; the clock that ticked so plainly when Charlie
                     died, is ticking on the mantel still. The great table in the middle of the
                     room, with its books and work, waits only for the lighting of the evening lamp,
                     to see a return to its stores of embroidery, and of story.</p>
                  <p>Upon a little stand under the mirror, which catches now and then a flicker of
                     the fire-light, and makes it play, as if in wanton, upon the ceiling, lies that
                     big book, reverenced of your New England parents—the Family Bible. It is a
                     ponderous square volume, with heavy silver clasps, that you have often pressed
                     open for a look at its quaint old pictures, or for a study of those prettily
                     bordered pages, which lie between the Testaments, and which hold the Family
                     Record.</p>
                  <p>There are the Births;—your father's, and your mother's; it seems as if they
                     were born a long time ago; and even your own date of birth appears an almost
                     incredible distance back. Then, there are the marriages;—only one as yet; and
                     your mother's maiden name looks oddly to you: it is hard to think of her as any
                     one else than your doting parent. You wonder if your name will ever come under
                     that paging; and wonder, though you scarce whisper the wonder to yourself, how
                     another name would look, just below yours—such a name for instance, as
                     Fanny,—or as Miss Margaret Boyne!</p>
                  <p>Last of all, come the Deaths—only one. Poor Charlie! How it looks?—'Died 12
                     September 18—Charles Henry, aged four years.' You know just how it looks. You
                     have turned to it often; there, you seem<pb n="106-107"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000054"/> to be joined to him, though only by the turning
                     of a leaf. And over your thoughts, as you look at that page of the record,
                     there sometimes wanders a vague shadowy fear, which <emph>will</emph>
                     come,—that your own name may soon be there. You try to drop the notion, as if
                     it were not fairly your own; you affect to slight it, as you would slight a boy
                     who presumed on your acquaintance, but whom you have no desire to know. It is a
                     common thing, you will find, with our world, to decline familiarity with those
                     ideas that fright us.</p>
                  <p>Yet your mother—how strange it is!—has no fears of such dark fancies. Even now,
                     as you stand beside her, and as the twilight deepens in the room, her low,
                     silvery voice is stealing upon your ear, telling you that she cannot be long
                     with you;—that the time is coming, when you must be guided by your own
                     judgment, and struggle with the world, unaided by the friends of your boyhood.
                     There is a little pride, and a great deal more of anxiety in your thoughts
                     now,—as you look steadfastly into the home blaze, while those delicate fingers,
                     so tender of your happiness, play with the locks upon your brow.</p>
                  <p>——To struggle with the world,—that is a proud thing; to struggle alone,—there
                     lies the doubt! Then, crowds in swift, upon the calm of boyhood, the first
                     anxious thought of youth;—then chases over the sky of Spring, the first heated,
                     and wrathful cloud of Summer!</p>
                  <p>But the lamps are now lit in the little parlor, and they shed a soft haze to
                     the farthest corner of the room; while the fire light streams over the floor
                     where puss lies purring. Little Madge is there; she has dropped in softly with
                     her mother, and Nelly has welcomed her with a bound, and with a kiss. Jenny has
                     not so rosy a cheek as Madge. But Jenny with her love notes, and her
                     languishing dark eye, you think of, as a lady; and the thought of her is a
                     constant drain upon your sentiment. As for Madge—that girl Madge, whom you know
                     so well,—you think of her as a sister; and yet—it is very odd,—you look at her
                     far oftener than you do at Nelly!</p>
                  <p>Frank too has come in to have a game with you at draughts; and he is in capital
                     spirits, all brisk and glowing with his evening's walk. He,—bless his honest
                     heart!—never observes that you arrange the board very adroitly, so that you may
                     keep half an eye upon Madge, as she sits yonder beside Nelly. Nor does he once
                     notice your blush, as you catch her eye, when she raises her head to fling back
                     the ringlets; and then, with a sly look at you, bends a most earnest gaze upon
                     the board, as if she were especially interested in the disposition of the
                     men.</p>
                  <p>You catch a little of the spirit of coquetry yourself—(what a native growth it
                     is!) and if she lift her eyes, when you are gazing at her, you very suddenly
                        divert<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7259-00000055"/> your look to the cat at
                     her feet; and remark to your friend Frank, in an easy, off-hand way—how still
                     the cat is lying!</p>
                  <p>And Frank turns—thinking probably, if he thinks at all about it, that cats are
                     very apt to lie still, when they sleep.</p>
                  <p>As for Nelly, half neglected by your thought, as well as by your eye, while
                     mischievous looking Madge is sitting by her, you little know as yet, what
                     kindness—what gentleness, you are careless of. Few loves in life, and you will
                     learn it before life is done, can balance the lost love of a sister.</p>
                  <p>As for your parents, in the intervals of the game, you listen dreamily to their
                     talk with the mother of Madge—good Mrs. Boyne. It floats over your mind, as you
                     rest your chin upon your clenched hand, like a strain of old familiar music,—a
                     household strain, that seems to belong to the habit of your ear,—a strain that
                     will linger about it melodiously for many years to come,—a strain that will be
                     recalled long time hence, when life is earnest and its cares heavy, with tears
                     of regret, and with sighs of bitterness.</p>
                  <p>By and by your game is done; and other games, in which join Nelly (the tears
                     come when you write her name, <emph>now!</emph>) and Madge (the smiles come
                     when you look on her <emph>then,</emph>) stretch out that sweet eventide of
                     Home, until the lamp flickers, and you speak your friends —adieu. To Madge, it
                     is said boldly—a boldness put on to conceal a little lurking tremor;—but there
                     is no tremor in the home good-night.</p>
                  <p>——Aye, my boy, kiss your mother—kiss her again;—fondle your sweet Nelly;—pass
                     your little hand through the gray locks of your father;—love them dearly, while
                     you can! Make your good-nights linger; and make your adieus long, and sweet,
                     and often repeated. Love with your whole soul,—Father, Mother, and Sister;—for
                     these loves shall die!</p>
                  <p>——Not indeed in thought:—God be thanked!—Nor yet in tears,—for He is merciful!
                     But they shall die as the leaves die,—die as Spring dies into the heat, and
                     ripeness of Summer, and as boy-hood dies into the elasticity and ambition of
                     youth. Death, distance, and time, shall each one of them dig graves for your
                     affections; but this you do not know, nor can know, until the story of your
                     life is ended.</p>
                  <p>The dreams of riches, of love, of voyage, of learning, that light up the
                     boy-age with splendor, will pass on and over into the hotter dreams of youth.
                     Spring buds and blossoms under the glowing sun of April, nurture at their heart
                     those firstlings of fruit, which the heat of summer shall ripen.</p>
                  <p>You little know,—and for this you may well thank Heaven—that you are leaving
                     the Spring of life, and that you are floating fast from the shady sources of<pb
                        n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7259-00000056"/> your years, into heat, bustle, and
                     storm. Your dreams are now faint, flickering shadows, that play like fire-flies
                     in the coppices of leafy June. They have no rule, but the rule of infantile
                     desire. They have no joys to promise, greater than the joys that belong to your
                     passing life; they have no terrors, but such terrors as the darkness of a
                     Spring night makes. They do not take hold on your soul, as the dreams of youth
                     and manhood will do.</p>
                  <p>Your highest hope is shadowed in a cheerful, boyish home. You wish no friends
                     but the friends of boyhood;—no sister but your fond Nelly;—none to love better
                     than the playful Madge.</p>
                  <p>You forget, Clarence, that the Spring with you, is the Spring with them; and
                     that the storms of Summer may chace wide shadows over your path, and over
                     their's. And you forget, that SUMMER is even now, lowering with its mist, and
                     with its scorching rays, upon the hem of your flowery May!</p>
                  <p>——The hands of the old clock upon the mantel, that ticked off the hours when
                     Charlie sighed, and when Charlie died, draw on toward midnight. The shadows
                     that the fire-flame makes, grow dimmer and dimmer. And thus it is, that Home,
                     boy-home, passes away forever,—like the swaying of a pendulum,—like the fading
                     of a shadow on the floor!</p>

               <head>DREAMS OF YOUTH.</head>
               <head type="sub">SUMMER.</head>
               <p>I FEEL a great deal of pity for those honest, but misguided people, who call their
                  little, spruce suburban towns, or the shaded streets of their inland cities,—the
                  country: and I have still more pity for those who reckon a season at the summer
                  resorts—country enjoyment. Nay, my feeling is more violent than pity; and I count
                  it nothing less than blasphemy, so to take the name of the country in vain.</p>
               <p>I thank Heaven every summer's day of my life, that my lot was humbly cast, within
                  the hearing of romping brooks, and beneath the shadow of oaks. And from all the
                  tramp, and bustle of the world, into which fortune has led me in these latter
                  years of my life, I delight to steal away for days, and for weeks<pb n="114-115"
                     xml:id="VAC7259-00000058"/> together, and bathe my spirit in the freedom of the
                  old woods; and to grow young again, lying upon the brook side, and counting the
                  white clouds that sail along the sky, softly and tranquilly—even as holy memories
                  go stealing over the vault of life.</p>
               <p>I am deeply thankful that I could never find it in my heart, so to pervert truth,
                  as to call the smart villages with the tricksy shadow of their maple avenues—the
                  Country.</p>
               <p>I love these in their way; and can recall pleasant passages of thought, as I have
                  idled through the Sabbath-looking towns, or lounged at the inn-door of some quiet
                  New England village. But I love far better to leave them behind me; and to dash
                  boldly out to where some out-lying farm-house sits—like a witness—under the
                  shelter of wooded hills, or nestles in the lap of a noiseless valley.</p>
               <p>In the town, small as it may be, and darkened as it may be with the shadows of
                  trees, you cannot forget—men. Their voice, and strife, and ambition come to your
                  eye in the painted paling, in the swinging sign-board of the tavern, and—worst of
                  all—in the trim-printed "ATTORNEY AT LAW." Even the little milliner's shop, with
                  its meagre show of leghorns, and its string across the window, all hung with tabs
                  and with cloth roses, is a sad epitome of the great and conventional life of a
                  city neighborhood.</p>
               <p>I like to be rid of them all, as I am rid of them this mid-summer's day. I like to
                  steep my soul in a sea of quiet, with nothing floating past me as I lie moored to
                  my thought, but the perfume of flowers, and soaring birds, and shadows of
                  clouds.</p>
               <p>Two days since, I was sweltering in the heat of the City, jostled by the thousand
                  eager workers, and panting under the shadow of the walls. But I have stolen away;
                  and for two hours of healthful regrowth into the darling Past, I have been lying
                  this blessed summer's morning, upon the grassy bank of a stream that babbled me to
                  sleep in boyhood.——Dear, old stream, unchanging, unfaltering,—with no harsher
                  notes now than then,—never growing old,—smiling in your silver rustle, and calming
                  yourself in the broad, placid pools,—I love you, as I love a friend!</p>
               <p>But now, that the sun has grown scalding hot, and the waves of heat have come
                  rocking under the shadow of the meadow oaks, I have sought shelter in a chamber of
                  the old farm-house. The window-blinds are closed; but some of them are sadly
                  shattered, and I have intertwined in them a few branches of the late-blossoming,
                  white Azalia, so that every puff of the summer air comes to me cooled with
                  fragrance. A dimple or two of the sunlight still steals through my flowery screen,
                  and dances (as the breeze moves the branches) upon the oaken floor of the
                  farm-house.</p>
               <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7259-00000059"/>
               <p>Through one little gap indeed, I can see the broad stretch of meadow, and the
                  workmen in the field bending and swaying to their scythes. I can see too the
                  glistening of the steel, as they wipe their blades; and can just catch floating on
                  the air, the measured, tinkling thwack of the rifle stroke.</p>
               <p>Here and there a lark, scared from his feeding place in the grass, soars up,
                  bubbling forth his melody in globules of silvery sound, and settles upon some tall
                  tree, and waves his wings, and sinks to the swaying twigs. I hear too a quail
                  piping from the meadow fence, and another trilling his answering whistle from the
                  hills. Nearer by, a tyrant king-bird is poised on the topmost branch of a veteran
                  pear-tree; and now and then dashes down assassin-like, upon some home-bound,
                  honey-laden bee, and then, with a smack of his bill, resumes his predatory
                  watch.</p>
               <p>A chicken or two lie in the sun, with a wing and a leg stretched out,—lazily
                  picking at the gravel, or relieving their ennui from time to time, with a
                  spasmodic rustle of their feathers. An old, matronly hen stalks about the yard
                  with a sedate step; and with quiet self-assurance, she utters an occasional series
                  of hoarse, and heated clucks. A speckled turkey, with an astonished brood at her
                  heels, is eyeing curiously, and with earnest variations of the head, a full-fed
                  cat, that lies curled up, and dozing, upon the floor of the cottage porch.</p>
               <p>As I sit thus, watching through the interstices of my leafy screen the various
                  images of country life, I hear distant mutterings from beyond the hills.</p>
               <p>The sun has thrown its shadow upon the pewter dial, two hours beyond the meridian
                  line. Great cream-colored heads of thunder clouds are lifting above the sharp,
                  clear line of the western horizon: the light breeze dies away, and the air becomes
                  stifling, even under the shadow of my withered boughs in the chamber window. The
                  white-capped clouds roll up nearer and nearer to the sun; and the creamy masses
                  below grow dark in their seams. The mutterings that came faintly before, now
                  spread into wide volumes of rolling sound, that echo again, and again, from the
                  eastward heights.</p>
               <p>I hear in the deep intervals, the men shouting to their teams in the meadows; and
                  great companies of startled swallows are dashing in all directions around the gray
                  roofs of the barn.</p>
               <p>The clouds have now well nigh reached the sun, which seems to shine the fiercer
                  for his coming eclipse. The whole West, as I look from the sources of the brook,
                  to its lazy drift under the swamps that lie to the South, is hung with a curtain
                  of darkness; and<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7259-00000060"/> like swift-working,
                  golden ropes that lift it toward the Zenith, long chains of lightning flash
                  through it; and the growing thunder seems like the rumble of the pulleys.</p>
               <p>I thrust away my azalia boughs, and fling back the shattered blinds as the sun and
                  the clouds meet; and my room darkens with the coming shadows. For an instant, the
                  edges of the thick creamy masses of cloud are gilded by the shrouded sun, and show
                  gorgeous scollops of gold, that toss upon the hem of the storm. But the blazonry
                  fades as the clouds mount; and the brightening lines of the lightning dart up from
                  the lower skirts, and heave the billowy masses into the middle Heaven.</p>
               <p>The workmen are urging their oxen fast across the meadow; and the loiterers come
                  straggling after, with rakes upon their shoulders. The matronly hen has retreated
                  to the stable door; and the brood of turkeys stand, dressing their feathers, under
                  the open shed.</p>
               <p>The air freshens, and blows now from the face of the coming clouds. I see the
                  great elms in the plain swaying their tops, even before the storm breeze has
                  reached me; and a bit of ripened grain upon a swell of the meadow, waves and
                  tosses like a billowy sea.</p>
               <p>Presently, I hear the rush of the wind; and the cherry and pear trees rustle
                  through all their leaves; and my paper is whisked away by the intruding blast.</p>
               <p>There is a quiet of a moment, in which the wind even, seems weary and faint; and
                  nothing finds utterance save one hoarse tree-toad, doling out his lugubrious
                  notes.</p>
               <p>Now comes a blinding flash from the clouds; and a quick, sharp clang clatters
                  through the heavens, and bellows loud, and long among the hills. Then,—like great
                  grief, spending its pent agony in tears—come the big drops of rain:—pattering on
                  the lawn, and on the leaves, and most musically of all, upon the roof above
                  me;—not now, with the light fall of the SPRING shower, but with strong
                  steppings—like the first proud tread of YOUTH!</p>

                  <head>I.</head>
                  <head type="sub">CLOISTER LIFE.</head>
                  <p>IT has very likely occurred to you, my reader, that I am playing the wanton in
                     these sketches;—and am breaking through all the canons of the writers, in
                     making YOU my hero.</p>
                  <p>It is even so; for my work is a story of those vague feelings, doubts,
                     passions, which belong more or less to every man of us all; and therefore it
                     is, that I lay upon your shoulders the burden of these dreams. If this or that
                     one, never belonged to your experience,—have patience for a while. I feel sure
                     that others are coming, which will lie like a truth upon your heart; and draw
                     you unwittingly—perhaps tearfully even—into the belief that YOU are indeed my
                     hero.</p>
                  <p>The scene now changes to the cloister of a college;— not the gray, classic
                     cloisters which lie along the banks of the Cam or the Isis—huge, battered
                     hulks, on whose weather-stained decks, great captains of learning have fought
                     away their lives; nor yet the cavernous, quadrangular courts, that sleep under
                     the dingy walls of the Sorbonne.</p>
                  <p>The youth-dreams of Clarence, begin under the roof of one of those long,
                     ungainly piles of brick and mortar, which make the colleges of New England.</p>
                  <p>The floor of the room is rough, and divided by wide seams. The study table does
                     not stand firmly, without a few spare pennies to prop it into solid footing.
                     The book-case of stained fir-wood, suspended against the wall by cords, is
                     meagrely stocked, with a couple of Lexicons, a pair of grammars, a Euclid, a
                     Xenophon, a Homer, and a Livy. Beside these, are scattered about here and
                     there,—a thumb-worn copy of British ballads, an odd volume of the Sketch Book,
                     a clumsy Shakspeare, and a pocket edition of the Bible.</p>
                  <p>With such appliances, added to the half score of Professors and Tutors who
                     preside over the awful precincts, you are to work your way up to that proud
                     entry upon our American life, which begins with the Baccalaureate degree. There
                     is a tingling sensation in walking first under the shadow of those walls,
                     uncouth as they are, and in feeling that you belong to them;—that you are a
                     member, as it were, of the body<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7259-00000062"/>
                     corporate, subject to an actual code of printed laws, and to actual moneyed
                     fines—varying from a shilling, to fifty cents!</p>
                  <p>There is something exhilarating in the very consciousness of your subject
                     state; and in the necessity of measuring your hours by the habit of such a
                     learned community. You think back upon your respect for the lank figure of some
                     old teacher of boy days, as a childish weakness: even the little coteries of
                     the home fire-side, lose their importance, when compared with the extraordinary
                     sweep, and dignity of your present position.</p>
                  <p>It is pleasant to measure yourself with men; and there are those about you, who
                     seem to your untaught eye, to be men already. Your chum, a hard-faced fellow of
                     ten more years than you,—digging sturdily at his tasks, seems by that very
                     community of work, to dignify your labor. You watch his cold, gray eye bending
                     down over some theorem of Euclid, with a kind of proud companionship, in what
                     so tasks his manliness.</p>
                  <p>It is nothing for him to quit sleep at the first tinkling of the alarm clock
                     that hangs in your chamber; or to brave the weather, in that cheerless run to
                     the morning prayers of winter. Yet, with what a dreamy horror, you wake on
                     mornings of snow, to that tinkling alarum!—and glide in the cold and darkness,
                     under the shadow of the college walls:—shuddering under the sharp gusts that
                     come sweeping between the buildings;—and afterward, gathering yourself up in
                     your cloak, to watch in a sleepy, listless maze, the flickering lamps that hang
                     around the dreary chapel! You follow half unconsciously some tutor's rhetorical
                     reading of a chapter of Isaiah; and then, as he closes the Bible with a
                     flourish, your eye, half-open, catches the feeble figure of the old Domine, as
                     he steps to the desk, and with his frail hands stretched out upon the cover of
                     the big book, and his head leaning slightly to one side, runs through in gentle
                     and tremulous tones, his wonted form of Invocation.</p>
                  <p>Your Division room is steaming with foul heat, and there is a strong smell of
                     burnt feathers, and oil. A jaunty tutor with pug nose, and consequential air,
                     steps into the room—while you all rise to show him deference,—and takes his
                     place at the pulpit-like desk. Then come the formal loosing of his camlet cloak
                     clasp,—the opening of his sweaty Xenophon to where the day's <foreign
                        xml:lang="LAT">parasangs</foreign> begin,—the unsliding of his silver pencil
                     case,—the keen, sour look around the benches, and the cool pinch of his thumb
                     and forefinger, into the fearful box of names!</p>
                  <p>How you listen for each as it is uttered,—running down the page in
                     advance,—rejoicing when some hard passage comes to a stout man in the corner;
                     and what<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7259-00000063"/> a sigh of relief—on
                     mornings after you have been out late at night,—when the last paragraph is
                     reached,—the ballot drawn, and—you, safe!</p>
                  <p>You speculate dreamily upon the faces around you. You wonder what sort of
                     schooling they may have had, and what sort of homes. You think one man has got
                     an extraordinary name; and another, a still more extraordinary nose. The glib,
                     easy way of one student, and his perfect <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >sang-froid,</foreign> completely charm you: you set him down in your own
                     mind as a kind of Crichton. Another weazen-faced, pinched-up fellow in a scant
                     cloak, you think must have been sometime a school-master: he is so very
                     precise, and wears such an indescribable look of the ferule. There is one big
                     student, with a huge beard, and a rollicking good-natured eye, who you would
                     quite like to see measure strength with your old usher; and on careful
                     comparison, rather think the usher would get the worst of it. Another appears
                     as venerable as some fathers you have seen; and it seems wonderfully odd, that
                     a man old enough to have children, should recite Xenophon by morning
                     candle-light!</p>
                  <p>The class in advance, you study curiously; and are quite amazed at the
                     precocity of certain youths belonging to it, who are apparently about your own
                     age. The Juniors you look upon, with a quiet reverence for their aplomb, and
                     dignity of character; and look forward with intense yearnings, to the time when
                     you too, shall be admitted freely to the precincts of the Philosophical
                     chamber, and to the very steep benches of the Laboratory. This last, seems,
                     from occasional peeps through the blinds, a most mysterious building. The
                     chimneys, recesses, vats, and cisterns—to say nothing of certain galvanic
                     communications, which you are told, traverse the whole building—in a way
                     capable of killing a rat, at an incredible remove from the bland
                     professor,—utterly fatigue your wonder! You humbly trust—though you have doubts
                     upon the point—that you will have the capacity to grasp it all, when once you
                     shall have arrived at the dignity of a Junior.</p>
                  <p>As for the Seniors, your admiration for them is entirely boundless. In one or
                     two individual instances, it is true, it has been broken down, by an
                     unfortunate squabble, with thick set fellows in the Chapel aisle. A person who
                     sits not far before you at prayers, and whose name you seek out very early,
                     bears a strong resemblance to some portrait of Dr. Johnson; you have very much
                     the same kind of respect for him, that you feel for the great lexicographer;
                     and do not for a moment doubt his capacity to compile a Dictionary equal if not
                     superior to Johnson's.</p>
                  <p>Another man with very bushy, black hair, and an easy look of importance,
                     carries a large cane; and is represented to you, as an astonishing scholar,
                        and<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7259-00000064"/> speaker. You do not doubt it;
                     his very air proclaims it. You think of him, as, presently—(say four or five
                     years hence)—astounding the United States Senate with his eloquence. And when
                     once you have heard him in debate, with that ineffable gesture of his, you
                     absolutely languish in your admiration for him; and you describe his speaking
                     to your country friends, as very little inferior, if any, to Mr. Burke's.
                     Beside this one, are some half dozen others, among whom the question of
                     superiority is, you understand, strongly mooted. It puzzles you to think, what
                     an avalanche of talent will fall upon the country, at the graduation of those
                     Seniors!</p>
                  <p>You will find, however, that the country bears such inundations of college
                     talent, with a remarkable degree of equanimity. It is quite wonderful how all
                     the Burkes, and Scotts, and Peels, among college Seniors, do quietly disappear,
                     as a man gets on in life.</p>
                  <p>As for any degree of fellowship with such giants, it is an honor hardly to be
                     thought of. But you have a classmate—I will call him Dalton,—who is very
                     intimate with a dashing Senior; they room near each other outside the college.
                     You quite envy Dalton, and you come to know him well. He says that you are not
                     a 'green-one,'—that you have 'cut your eye teeth'; in return for which
                     complimentary opinions, you entertain a strong friendship for Dalton.</p>
                  <p>He is a 'fast,' fellow, as the Senior calls him; and it is a proud thing to
                     happen at their rooms occasionally, and to match yourself for an hour or two
                     (with the windows darkened) against a Senior at 'old sledge.' It is quite 'the
                     thing' as Dalton says, to meet a Senior familiarly in the street. Sometimes you
                     go, after Dalton has taught you 'the ropes,' to have a cosy sit-down over
                     oysters and champagne;—to which the Senior lends himself, with the pleasantest
                     condescension in the world. You are not altogether used to hard drinking; but
                     this, you conceal,—as most spirited young fellows do,—by drinking a great deal.
                     You have a dim recollection of certain circumstances—very unimportant, yet very
                     vividly impressed on your mind,—which occurred on one of these occasions.</p>
                  <p>The oysters were exceedingly fine, and the champagne—exquisite. You have a
                     recollection of something being said, toward the end of the first bottle, of
                     Xenophon, and of the Senior's saying in his playful way,—'Oh, d—n
                     Xenophon!'</p>
                  <p>You remember Dalton laughed at this; and you laughed—for company. You remember
                     that you thought, and Dalton thought, and the Senior thought—by a singular
                     coincidence, that the second bottle of champagne was better even than the
                     first. You have a dim remembrance of the Senior's saying very loudly,
                     "Clarence—(calling you by your family name)<pb n="128-129"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000065"/> is no spooney;" and drinking a bumper with you
                     in confirmation of the remark.</p>
                  <p>You remember that Dalton broke out into a song, and that for a time you joined
                     in the chorus; you think the Senior called you to order for repeating the
                     chorus, in the wrong place. You think the lights burned with remarkable
                     brilliancy; and you remember that a remark of yours to that effect, met with
                     very much such a response from the Senior, as he had before employed with
                     reference to Xenophon.</p>
                  <p>You have a confused idea of calling Dalton—Xenophon. You think the meeting
                     broke up with a chorus; and that somebody—you cannot tell who—broke two or
                     three glasses. You remember questioning yourself very seriously, as to whether
                     you were or were not, tipsy. You think you decided that you were not, but—might
                     be.</p>
                  <p>You have a confused recollection of leaning upon some one, or something, going
                     to your room; this sense of a desire to lean, you think was very strong. You
                     remember being horribly afflicted with the idea of having tried your night key
                     at the tutor's door, instead of your own; you remember further a hot
                     stove,—made certain indeed, by a large blister which appeared on your hand,
                     next day. You think of throwing off your clothes, by one or two spasmodic
                     efforts,—leaning, in the intervals, against the bed-post.</p>
                  <p>There is a recollection of an uncommon dizziness afterward—as if your body was
                     very quiet, and your head gyrating with strange velocity, and a kind of
                     centrifugal action, all about the room, and the college, and indeed the whole
                     town. You think that you felt uncontrollable nausea after this, followed by
                     positive sickness;—which waked your chum, who thought you very incoherent, and
                     feared derangement.</p>
                  <p>A dismal state of lassitude follows, broken by the college clock striking
                     three, and by very rambling reflections upon champagne, Xenophon, 'Captain
                     Dick,' Madge, and the old deacon who clinched his wig in the church.</p>
                  <p>The next morning—(ah, how vexatious that all our follies are followed by
                     a—'next morning!') you wake with a parched mouth, and a torturing thirst; the
                     sun is shining broadly into your reeking chamber. Prayers and recitations are
                     long ago over; and you see through the door, in the outer room, that hard faced
                     chum, with his Lexicon, and Livy, open before him, working out with all the
                     earnestness of his iron purpose, the steady steps toward preferment, and
                     success.</p>
                  <p>You go with some story of sudden sickness to the Tutor;—half fearful that the
                     bloodshot, swollen eyes will betray you. It is very mortifying too, to meet
                     Dalton appearing so gay, and lively after it all, while<pb n="130-131"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000066"/> you wear such an air of being 'used up.' You
                     envy him thoroughly the extraordinary capacity that he has.</p>
                  <p>Here and there creeps in, amid all the pride and shame of the new life, a
                     tender thought of the old home; but its joys are joys no longer: its highest
                     aspirations even, have resolved themselves into fine mist,—like rainbows, that
                     the sun drinks with his beams.</p>
                  <p>The affection for a mother, whose kindness you recal with a suffused eye, is
                     not gone, or blighted; but it is woven up, as only a single adorning tissue,
                     into the growing pride of youth: it is cherished in the proud soul, rather as a
                     redeeming weakness, than as a vital energy.</p>
                  <p>And the love for Nelly, though it bates no jot of fervor, is woven into the
                     scale of growing purposes, rather as a color to adorn, than as a strand to
                     strengthen.</p>
                  <p>As for your other loves, those romantic ones, which were kindled by bright
                     eyes, and the stolen reading of Miss Porter's novels, they linger on your mind
                     like perfumes; and they float down your memory, with the figure, the step, the
                     last words of those young girls, who raised them,—like the types of some
                     dimly-shadowed, but deeper passion, which is some time to spur your maturer
                     purposes, and to quicken your manly resolves.</p>
                  <p>It would be hard to tell, for you do not as yet know, but that Madge
                     herself,—hoydenish, blue-eyed Madge, is to be the very one who will gain such
                     hold upon your riper affections, as she has held already over your boyish
                     caprice. It is a part of the pride,—I may say rather an evidence of the pride,
                     which youth feels in leaving boyhood behind him, to talk laughingly, and
                     carelessly, of those attachments which made his young years so balmy with
                     dreams.</p>

                  <head type="sub">FIRST AMBITION.</head>
                  <p>I BELIEVE that sooner or later, there come to every man, dreams of ambition.
                     They may be covered with the sloth of habit, or with a pretence of humility:
                     they may come only in dim, shadowy visions, that feed the eye, like the glories
                     of an ocean sun-rise; but, you may be sure that they will come: even before one
                     is aware, the bold, adventurous Goddess, whose name is Ambition, and whose
                     dower is Fame, will be toying with the feeble heart. And she pushes her
                     ventures with a bold hand: she makes timidity strong, and weakness valiant.</p>
                  <p>The way of a man's heart, will be foreshadowed by what goodness lies in
                     him,—coming from above, and from around;—but a way foreshadowed, is not a way
                     made. And the making of a man's way, comes only from that quickening of
                     resolve, which we call Ambition. It is the spur that makes man struggle with
                     Destinv: it is Heaven's own incentive, to make Purpose great, and Achievement
                     greater.</p>
                  <p>It would be strange if you, in that cloister life of a college, did not
                     sometimes feel a dawning of new resolves. They grapple you indeed, oftener than
                     you dare to speak of. Here, you dream first of that very sweet, but very
                     shadowy success, called reputation.</p>
                  <p>You think of the delight and astonishment, it would give your mother and
                     father, and most of all, little Nelly, if you were winning such honors, as now
                     escape you. You measure your capacities by those about you, and watch their
                     habit of study; you gaze for a half hour together, upon some successful man,
                     who has won his prizes; and wonder by what secret action he has done it. And
                     when, in time, you come to be a competitor yourself, your anxiety is
                     immense.</p>
                  <p>You spend hours upon hours at your theme. You write and re-write; and when it
                     is at length complete, and out of your hands, you are harassed by a thousand
                     doubts. At times, as you recal your hours of toil, you question if so much has
                     been spent upon any other; you feel almost certain of success. You repeat to
                     yourself, some passages of special eloquence, at night. You fancy the
                     admiration of<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7259-00000068"/> the Professors at
                     meeting with such wonderful performance. You have a slight fear that its
                     superior goodness may awaken the suspicion, that some one out of the
                     college—some superior man, may have written it. But this fear dies away.</p>
                  <p>The eventful day is a great one in your calendar; you hardly sleep the night
                     previous. You tremble as the Chapel bell is rung; you profess to be very
                     indifferent, as the reading, and the prayer close; you even stoop to take up
                     your hat,—as if you had entirely overlooked the fact, that the old President
                     was in the desk, for the express purpose of declaring the successful names. You
                     listen dreamily to his tremulous, yet fearfully distinct enunciation. Your head
                     swims strangely.</p>
                  <p>They all pass out with a harsh murmur, along the aisles, and through the door
                     ways. It would be well if there were no disappointments in life more terrible
                     than this. It is consoling to express very deprecating opinions of the Faculty
                     in general;—and very contemptuous ones of that particular officer who decided
                     upon the merit of the prize themes. An evening or two at Dalton's room go still
                     farther toward healing the disappointment; and—if it must be said—toward
                     moderating the heat of your ambition.</p>
                  <p>You grow up however, unfortunately, as the College years fly by, into a very
                     exaggerated sense of your own capacities. Even the good, old, white-haired
                     Squire, for whom you had once entertained so much respect, seems to your crazy,
                     classic fancy, a very hum-drum sort of personage. Frank, although as noble a
                     fellow as ever sat a horse, is yet—you cannot help thinking—very ignorant of
                     Euripides; even the English master at Dr. Bidlow's school, you feel sure would
                     balk at a dozen problems you could give him.</p>
                  <p>You get an exalted idea of that uncertain quality, which turns the heads of a
                     vast many of your fellows, called—Genius. An odd notion seems to be inherent in
                     the atmosphere of those College chambers, that there is a certain faculty of
                     mind—first developed as would seem in Colleges,—which accomplishes whatever it
                     chooses, without any special pains-taking. For a time, you fall yourself into
                     this very unfortunate hallucination; you cultivate it, after the usual college
                     fashion, by drinking a vast deal of strong coffee, and whiskey toddy,—by
                     writing a little poor verse, in the Byronic temper, and by studying very late
                     at night, with closed blinds.</p>
                  <p>It costs you, however, more anxiety and hypocrisy than you could possibly have
                     believed.</p>
                  <p>——You will learn, Clarence, when the Autumn has rounded your hopeful Summer, if
                     not before, that there is no Genius in life, like the Genius of energy and
                     industry. You will learn, that all the traditions so<pb n="136-137"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000069"/> current among very young men, that certain great
                     characters have wrought their greatness by an inspiration as it were, grow out
                     of a sad mistake.</p>
                  <p>And you will further find, when you come to measure yourself with men, that
                     there are no rivals so formidable, as those earnest, determined minds, which
                     reckon the value of every hour, and which achieve eminence by persistent
                     application.</p>
                  <p>Literary ambition may inflame you at certain periods; and a thought of some
                     great names will flash like a spark into the mine of your purposes; you dream
                     till midnight over books; you set up shadows, and chase them down—other
                     shadows, and they fly. Dreaming will never catch them. Nothing makes the 'scent
                     lie well,' in the hunt after distinction, but labor.</p>
                  <p>And it is a glorious thing, when once you are weary of the dissipation, and the
                     ennui of your own aimless thought, to take up some glowing page of an earnest
                     thinker, and read—deep, and long, until you feel the metal of his thought
                     tinkling on your brain, and striking out from your flinty lethargy, flashes of
                     ideas, that give the mind light and heat. And away you go, in the chase of what
                     the soul within, is creating on the instant, and you wonder at the fecundity of
                     what seemed so barren, and at the ripeness of what seemed so crude. The glow of
                     toil wakes you to the consciousness of your real capacities: you feel sure that
                     they have taken a new step toward final development. In such mood it is, that
                     one feels grateful to the musty tomes, which at other hours, stand like
                     curiosity-making mummies, with no warmth, and no vitality. Now they grow into
                     the affections like new-found friends; and gain a hold upon the heart, and
                     light a fire in the brain, that the years and the mould cannot cover, nor
                     quench.</p>

                  <head type="sub">COLLEGE ROMANCE.</head>
                  <p>IN following the mental vagaries of youth, I must not forget the curvetings and
                     wiltings of the heart.</p>
                  <p>The black-eyed Jenny, with whom a correspondence at red heat, was kept up for
                     several weeks, is long before this, entirely out of your regard;—not so much by
                     reason of the six months disparity of age, as from the fact, communicated quite
                     confidentially by the travelled Nat, that she has had a desperate flirtation
                     with a handsome midshipman. The conclusion is natural, that she is an
                     inconstant, cruel-hearted creature, with little appreciation of real worth; and
                     furthermore, that all midshipmen are a very contemptible, not to say,—dangerous
                     set of men. She is consigned to forgetfulness and neglect; and the late lover
                     has long ago consoled himself, by reading in a spirited way, that passage of
                     Childe Harold, commencing,— <q>
                        <l>I have not loved the world, nor the world me.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for Madge, the memory of her has been more wakeful, but less violent. To say
                     nothing of occasional returns to the old homestead when you have met her,
                     Nelly's letters not unfrequently drop a careless half-sentence, that keeps her
                     strangely in mind.</p>
                  <p>'Madge,' she says, 'is sitting by me with her work;' or, 'you ought to see the
                     little, silk purse that Madge is knitting;' or, speaking of some country
                     rout—'Madge was there in the sweetest dress you can imagine.' All this will
                     keep Madge in mind; not it is true in the ambitious moods, or in the frolics
                     with Dalton; but in those odd half hours that come stealing over one at
                     twilight, laden with sweet memories of the days of old.</p>
                  <p>A new Romantic admiration is started by those pale lady-faces which light up,
                     on a Sunday, the gallery of the college chapel. An amiable and modest fancy,
                     gives to them all a sweet classic grace. The very atmosphere of those courts,
                     wakened with high metaphysic discourse, seems to lend them a Greek beauty, and
                     finesse; and you attach to the prettiest that your eye can reach, all the
                     charms of some Sciote maiden,<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7259-00000071"/> and
                     all the learning of her father—the Professor. And as you lie half-wakeful, and
                     half-dreaming, through the long Divisions of the Doctor's morning discourse,
                     the twinkling eyes in some corner of the gallery, bear you pleasant company, as
                     you float down those streaming visions, which radiate from you, far over the
                     track of the coming life.</p>
                  <p>But following very closely upon this, comes a whole volume of street romance.
                     There are prettily shaped figures that go floating, at convenient hours for
                     college observation, along the thoroughfares of the town. And these figures
                     come to be known, and the dresses, and the streets; and even the door-plate is
                     studied. The hours are ascertained, by careful observation, and induction, at
                     which some particular figure is to be met; or is to be seen at some low parlor
                     window, in white summer dress, with head leaning on the hand,—very melancholy,
                     and very dangerous. Perhaps her very card is stuck proudly into a corner of the
                     mirror, in the college chamber. After this may come moonlight meetings at the
                     gate, or long listenings to the plaintive lyrics that steal out of the parlor
                     windows, and that blur wofully the text of the Conic Sections.</p>
                  <p>Or, perhaps she is under the fierce eye of some Cerberus of a school mistress,
                     about whose grounds you prowl piteously, searching for small knot holes in the
                     surrounding board-fence, through which little souvenirs of impassioned feeling
                     may be thrust. Sonnets are written for the town papers, full of telling
                     phrases, and with classic allusions, and foot notes, which draw attention to
                     some similar felicity of expression in Horace, or Ovid. Correspondence may even
                     be ventured on, enclosing locks of hair, and interchanging rings, and paper
                     oaths of eternal fidelity.</p>
                  <p>But the old Cerberus is very wakeful: the letters fail: the lamp that used to
                     glimmer for a sign among the sycamores, is gone out: a stolen wave of a
                     handkerchief,—a despairing look,—and tears, which you fancy, but do not
                     see,—make you miserable for long days.</p>
                  <p>The tyrant teacher, with no trace of compassion in her withered heart, reports
                     you to the college authorities. There is a long lecture of admonition upon the
                     folly of such dangerous practices; and if the offence be aggravated by some
                     recent joviality with Dalton and the Senior, you are condemned to a month of
                     exile with a country clergyman. There are a few tearful regrets over the
                     painful tone of the home letters; but the bracing country air, and the pretty
                     faces of the village girls heal your heart,—with fresh wounds.</p>
                  <p>The old Doctor sees dimly through his spectacles; and his pew gives a good look
                     out upon the smiling choir of singers. A collegian wears the honors of a
                     stranger; and the country bucks stand but poor chance<pb n="142-143"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000072"/> in contrast with your wonderful attainments in
                     cravats and verses. But this fresh dream, odorous with its memories of
                     sleigh-rides, or lilac blossoms, slips by, and yields again to the more
                     ambitious dreams of the cloister.</p>
                  <p>In the prouder moments that come, when you are more a man, and less a boy—with
                     more of strategy and less of faith—your thought of woman runs loftily: not
                     loftily in the realm of virtue or goodness, but loftily on your new
                     world-scale. The pride of intellect that is thirsting in you, fashions ideal
                     graces after a classic model. The heroines of fable are admired; and the soul
                     is tortured with that intensity of passion, which gleams through the broken
                     utterances of Grecian tragedy.</p>
                  <p>In the vanity of self-consciousness, one feels at a long remove above the
                     ordinary love and trustfulness of a simple and pure heart. You turn away from
                     all such with a sigh of conceit, to graze on that lofty, but bitter pasturage,
                     where no daisies grow. Admiration may be called up by some graceful figure that
                     you see moving under those sweeping elms; and you follow it with an intensity
                     of look that makes you blush; and straightway, hide the memory of the blush, by
                     summing up some artful sophistry, that resolves your delighted gaze into a
                     weakness, and your contempt into a virtue.</p>
                  <p>But this cannot last. As the years drop off, a certain pair of eyes beam one
                     day upon you, that seem to have been cut out of a page of Greek poetry. They
                     have all its sentiment, its fire, its intellectual reaches: it would be hard to
                     say what they have not. The profile, is a Greek profile; and the heavy chestnut
                     hair is plaited in Greek bands. The figure too, might easily be that of Helen,
                     or of Andromache.</p>
                  <p>You gaze—ashamed to gaze; and your heart yearns—ashamed of its yearning. It is
                     no young girl, who is thus testing you: there is too much pride for that. A
                     ripeness, and maturity rest upon her look, and figure, that completely fill up
                     that ideal, which exaggerated fancies have wrought out of the Grecian heaven.
                     The vision steals upon you at all hours,—now rounding its flowing outline to
                     the mellifluous metre of Epic Hexameter, and again, with its bounding life,
                     pulsating with the glorious dashes of tragic verse.</p>
                  <p>Yet, with the exception of stolen glances, and secret admiration, you keep
                     aloof. There is no wish to fathom what seems a happy mystery. There lies a
                     content in secret obeisance. Sometimes it shames you, as your mind glows with
                     its fancied dignity; but the heart thrusts in its voice; and yielding to it,
                     you dream dreams, like fond, old Boccacio's, upon the olive-shaded slopes of
                     Italy. The tongue even, is not trusted with the thoughts that are seething
                     within: they begin and end in the voiceless pulsations of your nature.</p>
                  <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7259-00000073"/>
                  <p>After a time,—it seems a long time, but it is in truth, a very short time,—you
                     find who she is, who is thus entrancing you. It is done most carelessly. No
                     creature could imagine that you felt any interest in the accomplished sister—of
                     your friend Dalton. Yet it is even she, who has thus beguiled you; and she is
                     at least some ten years Dalton's senior; and by even more years,—your own!</p>
                  <p>It is singular enough, but it is true,—that the affections of that transition
                     state from youth to manliness, run toward the types of maturity. The mind in
                     its reaches toward strength, and completeness, creates a heart-sympathy—which,
                     in its turn, craves fullness. There is a vanity too about the first steps of
                     manly education, which is disposed to under-rate the innocence, and unripened
                     judgment of the other sex. Men see the mistake, as they grow older;—for the
                     judgment of a woman, in all matters of the affections, ripens by ten years,
                     faster than a man's.</p>
                  <p>In place of any relentings on such score, you are set on fire anew. The stories
                     of her accomplishments, and of her grace of conversation, absolutely drive you
                     mad. You watch your occasion for meeting her upon the street. You wonder if she
                     has any conception of your capacity for mental labor; and if she has any
                     adequate idea of your admiration for Greek poetry, and for herself?</p>
                  <p>You tie your cravat poet-wise, and wear broad collars, turned down, wondering
                     how such disposition may affect her. Her figure and step become a kind of
                     moving romance to you, drifting forward, and outward into that great land of
                     dreams, which you call the world. When you see her walking with others, you
                     pity her; and feel perfectly sure that if she had only a hint of that
                     intellectual fervor which in your own mind, blazes up at the very thought of
                     her, she would perfectly scorn the stout gentleman who spends his force in
                     tawdry compliments.</p>
                  <p>A visit to your home wakens ardor, by contrast, as much as by absence. Madge,
                     so gentle, and now stealing sly looks at you, in a way so different from her
                     hoydenish manner of school-days, you regard complacently, as a most lovable,
                     fond girl—the very one for some fond and amiable young man, whose soul is not
                     filled—as yours is—with higher things! To Nelly, earnestly listening, you drop
                     only exaggerated hints of the wonderful beauty, and dignity of this new being
                     of your fancy. Of her age, you scrupulously say nothing.</p>
                  <p>The trivialities of Dalton amaze you; it is hard to understand how a man within
                     the limit of such influences, as Miss Dalton must inevitably exert, can tamely
                     sit down to a rubber of whist, and cigars!<pb n="146-147"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000074"/> There must be a sad lack of congeniality; it
                     would certainly be a proud thing to supply that lack!</p>
                  <p>The new feeling, wild and vague as it is,—for as yet, you have only most casual
                     acquaintance with Laura Dalton,—invests the whole habit of your study; not
                     quickening overmuch the relish for Dugald Stewart, or the miserable skeleton of
                     college Logic; but spending a sweet charm upon the graces of Rhetoric, and the
                     music of Classic Verse. It blends harmoniously with your quickened ambition.
                     There is some last appearance that you have to make upon the College stage, in
                     the presence of the great worthies of the state, and of all the beauties of the
                     town,—Laura chiefest among them. In view of it, you feel dismally intellectual.
                     Prodigious faculties are to be brought to the task.</p>
                  <p>You think of throwing out ideas that will quite startle His Excellency the
                     Governor, and those very distinguished public characters, whom the College
                     purveyors vote into their periodic public sittings. You are quite sure of
                     surprising them, and of deeply provoking such scheming, shallow politicians, as
                     have never read 'Wayland's Treatise;' and who venture incautiously, within
                     hearing of your remarks. You fancy yourself in advance, the victim of a long
                     leader in the next day's paper; and the thoughtful, but quiet cause of a great
                     change in the political programme of the State. But crowning and eclipsing all
                     the triumph, are those dark eyes beaming on you from some corner of the Church,
                     their floods of unconscious praise and tenderness.</p>
                  <p>Your father and Nelly are there to greet you. He has spoken a few calm, quiet
                     words of encouragement, that make you feel—very wrongfully—that he is a cold
                     man, with no earnestness of feeling. As for Nelly, she clasps your arm with a
                     fondness, and with a pride, that tell at every step, her praises and her
                     love.</p>
                  <p>But even this, true and healthful as it is, fades before a single word of
                     commendation from the new arbitress of your feeling. You have seen Miss Dalton!
                     You have met her on that last evening of your cloistered life, in all the
                     elegance of ball costume; your eye has feasted on her elegant figure, and upon
                     her eye sparkling with the consciousness of beauty. You have talked with Miss
                     Dalton about Byron,—about Wordsworth,—about Homer. You have quoted poetry to
                     Miss Dalton; you have clasped Miss Dalton's hand!</p>
                  <p>Her conversation delights you by its piquancy and grace; she is quite ready to
                     meet you (a grave matter of surprise!) upon whatever subject you may suggest.
                     You lapse easily and lovingly into the current of her thought, and blush to
                     find yourself vacantly admiring, when she is looking for reply. The regard you
                     feel for her, resolves itself into an exquisite mental love, vastly superior as
                     you think, to any other kind of love. There is no dream of marriage as yet, but
                     only of<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7259-00000075"/> sitting beside her in the
                     moonlight, during a countless succession of hours, and talking of poetry and
                     nature,—of destiny, and love.</p>
                  <p>Magnificent Miss Dalton!</p>
                  <p>——And all the while, vaunting youth is almost mindless of the presence of that
                     fond Nelly, whose warm sisterly affection measures itself hopefully against the
                     proud associations of your growing years; and whose deep, loving eye half
                     suffused with its native tenderness, seems longing to win you back to the old
                     joys of that Home-love, which linger on the distant horizon of your boy-hood,
                     like the golden glories of a sinking day.</p>
                  <p>As the night wanes, you wander, for a last look, toward the dingy walls, that
                     have made for you so long a home. The old broken expectancies, the days of
                     glee, the triumphs, the rivalries, the defeats, the friendships, are recalled
                     with a fluttering of the heart, that pride cannot wholly subdue. You step upon
                     the Chapel-porch, in the quiet of the night, as you would step on the graves of
                     friends. You pace back and forth in the wan moonlight, dreaming of that dim
                     life which opens wide and long, from the morrow. The width and length oppress
                     you: they crush down your struggling self-consciousness, like Titans dealing
                     with Pigmies. A single piercing thought of the vast and shadowy future which is
                     so near, tears off on the instant all the gew-gaws of pride,—strips away the
                     vanity that doubles your bigness, and forces you down to the bare nakedness of
                     what you truly <emph>are!</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>With one more yearning look at the gray hulks of building, you loiter away
                     under the trees. The monster elms which have bowered your proud steps through
                     four years of proudest life, lift up to the night their rounded canopy of
                     leaves, with a quiet majesty that mocks you. They kiss the same calm sky, which
                     they wooed four years ago; and they droop their trailing limbs lovingly to the
                     same earth, which has steadily, and quietly, wrought in them their stature, and
                     their strength. Only here and there, you catch the loitering foot-fall of some
                     other benighted dreamer, strolling around the vast quadrangle of level green,
                     which lies like a prairie-child, under the edging shadows of the town. The
                     lights glimmer one by one; and one by one—like breaking hopes—they fade away
                     from the houses. The full risen moon that dapples the ground beneath the trees,
                     touches the tall church spires with silver; and slants their loftiness—as
                     memory slants grief—in long, dark, tapering lines, upon the silvered Green.</p>

                  <head>IV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">FIRST LOOK AT THE WORLD.</head>
                  <p>OUR Clarence is now fairly afloat upon the swift tide of Youth. The thrall of
                     teachers is ended, and the audacity of self-resolve is begun. It is not a
                     little odd, that when we have least strength to combat the world, we have the
                     highest confidence in our ability.</p>
                  <p>Very few individuals in the world, possess that happy consciousness of their
                     own prowess, which belongs to the newly graduated Collegian. He has most
                     abounding faith in the tricksy panoply that he has wrought out of the metal of
                     his Classics. His mathematics, he has not a doubt, will solve for him every
                     complexity of life's questions; and his logic will as certainly untie all
                     gordian knots, whether in politics or ethics.</p>
                  <p>He has no idea of defeat; he proposes to take the world by storm; he half
                     wonders that quiet people are not startled by his presence. He brushes with an
                     air of importance about the halls of country hotels; he wears his honor at the
                     public tables; he fancies that the inattentive guests can have little idea that
                     the young gentleman, who so recently delighted the public ear with his
                     dissertation on the "General tendency of Opinion," is actually among them; and
                     quietly eating from the same dish of beef, and of pudding!</p>
                  <p>Our poor Clarence does not know—heaven forbid he should!—that he is but little
                     wiser now, than when he turned his back upon the old Academy, with its
                     gallipots and broken retorts; and that with the addition of a few Greek roots,
                     a smattering of Latin, and some readiness of speech, he is almost as weak for
                     breasting the strong current of life, as when a boy. America is but a poor
                     place for the romantic book-dreamer. The demands of this new Western life of
                     ours, are practical, and earnest. Prompt action, and ready tact, are the
                     weapons by which to meet it, and subdue it. The education of the cloister
                     offers at best, only a sound starting point, from which to leap into the
                     tide.</p>
                  <p>The father of Clarence is a cool, matter-of-fact man. He has little sympathy
                     with any of the romantic notions that enthrall a youth of twenty. He has a very
                     humble opinion—much humbler than you think he<pb n="152-153"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000077"/> ought—of your attainments at College. He advises
                     a short period of travel, that by observation, you may find out more, how that
                     world is made up, with which you are henceforth to struggle.</p>
                  <p>Your mother half fears your alienation from the affections of home. Her letters
                     all run over with a tenderness that makes you sigh, and that makes you feel a
                     deep reproach. You may not have been wanting in the more ordinary tokens of
                     affection; you have made your periodic visits; but you blush for the
                     consciousness that fastens on you, of neglect at heart. You blush for the lack
                     of that glow of feeling, which once fastened to every home-object.</p>
                  <p>[Does a man indeed outgrow affections as his mind ripens? Do the early and
                     tender sympathies become a part of his intellectual perceptions, to be
                     appreciated and reasoned upon, as one reasons about truths of science? Is their
                     vitality necessarily young? Is there the same ripe, joyous burst of the heart,
                     at the recollection of later friendships, which belonged to those of boyhood;
                     and are not the later ones more the suggestions of judgment, and less, the
                     absolute conditions of the heart's health?]</p>
                  <p>The letters of your mother, as I said, make you sigh: there is no moment in our
                     lives when we feel less worthy of the love of others, and less worthy of our
                     own respect, than when we receive evidences of kindness ness, which we know we
                     do not merit; and when souls are laid bare to us, and we have too much
                     indifference to lay bare our own in return.</p>
                  <p>"Clarence"—writes that neglected mother—"you do not know how much you are in
                     our thoughts, and how often you are the burden of my prayers. Oh, Clarence, I
                     could almost wish that you were still a boy—still running to me for those
                     little favors, which I was only too happy to bestow,—still dependent in some
                     degree on your mother's love, for happiness.</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps I do you wrong, Clarence, but it does seem from the changing tone of
                     your letters that you are becoming more and more forgetful of us all;—that you
                     are feeling less need of our advice, and—what I feel far more deeply—less need
                     of our affection. Do not, my son, forget the lessons of home. There will come a
                     time, I feel sure, when you will know that those lessons are good. They may not
                     indeed help you in that intellectual strife which soon will engross you; and
                     they may not have fitted you to shine in what are called the brilliant circles
                     of the world; but they are such, Clarence, as make the heart pure, and honest,
                     and strong!</p>
                  <p>"You may think me weak to write you thus, as I would have written to my
                     light-hearted boy, years ago;—indeed I am not strong, but growing every day
                     more feeble.</p>
                  <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7259-00000078"/>
                  <p>"Nelly, your sweet sister, is sitting by me: 'Tell Clarence,' she says, 'to
                     come home soon.' You know, my son, what hearty welcome will greet you; and that
                     whether here, or away, our love and prayers will be with you always; and may
                     God, in his infinite mercy keep you from all harm!"</p>
                  <p>A tear or two,—brushed away, as soon as they come,—is all that youth gives, to
                     embalm such treasure of love! A gay laugh, or the challenge of some companion
                     of a day, will sweep away into the night, the earnest, regretful, yet happy
                     dreams, that rise like incense from the pages of such hallowed affection.</p>
                  <p>The brusque world too is to be met, with all its hurry and promptitude.
                     Manhood, in our swift American world, is measured too much by forgetfulness of
                     all the sweet liens which tie the heart to the home of its first attachments.
                     We deaden the glow that nature has kindled, lest it may lighten our hearts into
                     an enchanting flame of weakness. We have not learned to make that flame the
                     beacon of our purposes, and the warmer of our strength. We are men too
                     early.</p>
                  <p>But an experience is approaching Clarence, that will drive his heart home for
                     shelter, like a wounded bird!</p>
                  <p>——It is an autumn morning, with such crimson glories to kindle it, as lie along
                     the twin ranges of mountain that guard the Hudson. The white frosts shine like
                     changing silk, in the fields of late growing clover; the river mists curl, and
                     idle along the bosom of the water, and creep up the hill sides; and at noon,
                     float their feathery vapors aloft, in clouds; the crimson trees blaze in the
                     side valleys, and blend their vermillion tints under the fairy hands of our
                     American frost-painters, with the dark blood of the ash trees, and the orange
                     tinted oaks. Blue and bright, under the clear Fall heaven, the broad river
                     shines before the surging prow of the boat, like a shield of steel.</p>
                  <p>The bracing air lights up rich dreams of life. Your fancy peoples the valleys,
                     and the hill-tops with its creations; and your hope lends some crowning beauty
                     of the landscape, to your dreamy future. The vision of your last college year
                     is not gone. That figure whose elegance your eyes then feasted on, still floats
                     before you; and the memory of the last talk with Laura, is as vivid, as if it
                     were only yesterday, that you listened. Indeed, this opening campaign of
                     travel,—although you are half ashamed to confess it to yourself,—is guided by
                     the thought of her.</p>
                  <p>Dalton, with a party of friends, his sister among them, are journeying to the
                     north. A hope of meeting them—scarce acknowledged as an intention—spurs you on.
                     The eye rests dreamily, and vaguely on the beauties that appear at every turn:
                     they are beauties<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7259-00000079"/> that charm you,
                     and charm you the more by an indefinable association with that fairy object
                     that floats before you, half unknown, and wholly unclaimed. The quiet towns,
                     with their noon-day stillness, the out-lying mansions with their stately
                     splendor, the bustling cities with their mocking din, and the long reaches of
                     silent, and wooded shore, chime with their several beauties to your heart, in
                     keeping with the master key, that was touched long weeks before.</p>
                  <p>The cool, honest advices of the father, drift across your memory in shadowy
                     forms, as you wander through the streets of the first northern cities; and all
                     the need for observation, and the incentives to purpose, which your ambitious
                     designs would once have quickened, fade dismally, when you find that
                        <emph>she</emph> is not there. All the lax gaiety of Saratoga palls on the
                     appetite: even the magnificent shores of Lake George, though stirring your
                     spirit to an insensible wonder and love, do not cheat you into a trance that
                     lingers. In vain, the sun blazons every isle, and lights every shaded cove, and
                     at evening, stretches the Black mountain in giant slumber on the waters.</p>
                  <p>Your thought bounds away from the beauty of sky and lake, and fastens upon the
                     ideal which your dreamy humors cherish. The very glow of pursuit heightens your
                     fervor:—a fervor that dims sadly the new-wakened memories of home. The southern
                     gates of Champlain, those fir-draped Trosachs of America, are passed, and you
                     find yourself upon a golden evening of Canadian autumn, in the quaint old city
                     of Montreal.</p>
                  <p>Dalton, with his party, has gone down to Quebec. He is to return within a few
                     days, on his way to Niagara. There is a letter from Nelly waiting you. It
                     says:—'Mother is much more feeble: she often speaks of your return, in a way
                     that I am sure, if you heard, Clarence, would bring you back to us soon.'</p>
                  <p>There is a struggle in your mind: old affection is weaker than young pride and
                     hope. Moreover, the world is to be faced: the new scenes around you are to be
                     studied. An answer is penned full of kind remembrances, and begging a few days
                     of delay. You wander, wondering, under the quaint old houses, and wishing for
                     the return of Dalton.</p>
                  <p>He meets you with that happy, careless way of his—the dangerous way which some
                     men are born to,—and which chimes easily to every tone of the world:—a way you
                     wondered at once; a way, you admire now, and a way, that you will distrust, as
                     you come to see more of men. Miss Dalton—(it seems sacrilege to call her
                     Laura)—is the same elegant being that entranced you first.</p>
                  <p>They urge you to join their party. But there is no need of urgence: those eyes,
                     that figure, the whole presence indeed of Miss Dalton, attract you with a<pb
                        n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7259-00000080"/> power which you can neither explain,
                     nor resist. One look of grace enslaves you; and there is a strange pride in the
                     enslavement.</p>
                  <p>——Is it dream, or is it earnest,—those moon-lit walks upon the hills that skirt
                     the city, when you watch the stars, listening to her voice, and feel the
                     pressure of that jewelled hand upon your arm?—when you drain your memory of its
                     whole stock of poetic beauties, to lavish upon her ear? Is it love, or is it
                     madness, when you catch her eye, as it beams more of eloquence than lies in all
                     your moonlight poetry, and feel an exultant gush of the heart, that makes you
                     proud as a man, and yet timid as a boy, beside her?</p>
                  <p>Has Dalton with that calm, placid, nonchalant look of his, any inkling of the
                     raptures, which his elegant sister is exciting? Has the stout, elderly
                     gentleman who is so prodigal of his bouquets, and attentions, any idea of the
                     formidable rival that he has found? Has Laura herself—you dream—any conception
                     of that intensity of admiration with which you worship?</p>
                  <p>——Poor Clarence! it is his first look at Life!</p>
                  <p>The Thousand Isles with their leafy beauties, lie around your passing boat,
                     like the joys that skirt us and pass us, on our way through life. The Thousand
                     Isles rise sudden before you, and fringe your yeasty track, and drop away into
                     floating spectres of beauty— of haze—of distance, like those dreams of joy,
                     that your passion lends the brain. The low banks of Ontario look sullen by
                     night; and the moon, rising tranquilly over the tops of vast forests that stand
                     in majestic ranks over ten thousand acres of shore-land, drips its silvery
                     sparkles along the rocking waters, and flashes across your foamy wake.</p>
                  <p>With such attendance, that subdues for the time the dreamy forays of your
                     passion, you draw toward the sound of Niagara; and its distant, vague roar
                     coming through great aisles of gloomy forest, bears up your spirit, like a
                     child's, into the Highest Presence.</p>
                  <p>The morning after, you are standing with your party upon the steps of the
                     Hotel. A letter is handed to you. Dalton remarks in a quizzical way, that 'it
                     shows a lady's hand.'</p>
                  <p>"Aha, a lady!" says Miss Dalton;—and <emph>so</emph> gaily!</p>
                  <p>"A sister," I say; for it is Nelly's hand.</p>
                  <p>"By the by, Clarence," says Dalton, "it was a very pretty sister, you gave us a
                     glimpse of at commencement."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, you think so," and there is something in your tone, that shows a little
                     indignation at this careless mention of your fond Nelly;—and from those lips!
                     It will occur to you again.</p>
                  <p>A single glance at the letter blanches your cheek. Your heart throbs:—throbs
                     harder,—throbs tumultuously<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7259-00000081"/> ously.
                     You bite your lip; for there are lookers on. But it will not do. You hurry
                     away: you find your chamber: you close and lock the door, and burst into a
                     flood of tears.</p>

                  <head type="sub">A BROKEN HOME.</head>
                  <p>IT is Nelly's own fair hand, yet sadly blotted;—blotted with her tears, and
                     blotted with yours.</p>
                  <p>——"It is all over, dear, dear Clarence! oh, how I wish you were here to mourn
                     with us! I can hardly now believe that our poor mother is indeed dead."</p>
                  <p>——Dead!—It is a terrible word! You repeat it, with a fresh burst of grief. The
                     letter is crumpled in your hand.—Unfold it again, sobbing, and read on.</p>
                  <p>"For a week, she had been failing every day; but on Saturday, we thought her
                     very much better. I told her, I felt sure she would live to see you again.</p>
                  <p>'I shall never see him again, Nelly,' said she, bursting into tears."</p>
                  <p>——Ah, Clarence, where is your youthful pride, and<pb n="162-163"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000082"/> your strength now?—with only that frail paper to
                     annoy you, crushed in your grasp!</p>
                  <p>"She sent for Father, and taking his hand in hers, told him she was dying. I am
                     glad you did not see his grief. I was kneeling beside her, and she put her hand
                     upon my head, and let it rest there for a moment, while her lips moved, as if
                     she were praying.</p>
                  <p>'Kiss me, Nelly,' said she, growing fainter: 'kiss me again for Clarence.'</p>
                  <p>"A little while after she died."</p>
                  <p>For a long time you remain with only that letter, and your thought for company.
                     You pace up and down your chamber: again you seat yourself, and lean your head
                     upon the table, enfeebled by the very grief, that you cherish still. The whole
                     day passes thus: you excuse yourself from all companionship: you have not the
                     heart to tell the story of your troubles to Dalton,—least of all, to Miss
                     Dalton. How is this? Is sorrow too selfish, or too holy?</p>
                  <p>Toward night-fall there is a calmer, and stronger feeling. The voice of the
                     present world comes to your ear again. But you move away from it unobserved to
                     that stronger voice of God, in the Cataract. Great masses of angry cloud hang
                     over the West; but beneath them the red harvest sun shines over the long reach
                     of Canadian shore, and bathes the whirling rapids in splendor. You stroll alone
                     over the quaking bridge, and under the giant trees of the Island, to the edge
                     of the British Fall. You go out to the little shattered tower, and gaze down
                     with sensations that will last till death, upon the deep emerald of those awful
                     masses of water.</p>
                  <p>It is not the place for a bad man to ponder: it is not the atmosphere for foul
                     thoughts, or weak ones. A man is never better than when he has the humblest
                     sense of himself: he is never so unlike the spirit of Evil, as when his pride
                     is utterly vanished. You linger, looking upon the stream of fading sunlight
                     that plays across the rapids, and down into the shadow of the depths below, lit
                     up with their clouds of spray:—yet farther down, your sight swims upon the
                     black eddying masses, with white ribands streaming across their glassy surface;
                     and your dizzy eye fastens upon the frail cockle shells,—their stout oarsmen
                     dwindled to pigmies,—that dance like atoms upon the vast chasm,—or like your
                     own weak resolves upon the whirl of Time.</p>
                  <p>Your thought, growing broad in the view, seems to cover the whole area of life;
                     you set up your affections and your duties; you build hopes with fairy scenery,
                     and away they all go, tossing like the relentless waters to the deep gulf, that
                     gapes a hideous welcome! You sigh at your weakness of heart, or of endeavor,
                     and your sighs float out into the breeze that rises ever from the shock of the
                     waves, and whirl, empty-handed, to<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7259-00000083"/>
                     Heaven. You avow high purposes, and clench them with round utterance; and your
                     voice like a sparrow's, is caught up in the roar of the fall, and thrown at you
                     from the cliffs, and dies away in the solemn thunders of nature. Great thoughts
                     of life come over you—of its work and destiny—of its affections and duties, and
                     roll down swift—like the river—into the deep whirl of doubt and danger. Other
                     thoughts, grander and stronger, like the continuing rush of waters, come over
                     you, and knit your purposes together with their weight, and crush you to
                     exultant tears, and then leap, shattered and broken, from the very edge of your
                     intent,—into mists of fear!</p>
                  <p>The moon comes out, and gleaming through the clouds, braids its light,
                     fantastic bow upon the waters. You feel calmer as the night deepens. The
                     darkness softens you; it hangs—like the pall that shrouds your mother's
                     corpse,—low and heavily to your heart. It helps your inward grief, with some
                     outward show. It makes the earth a mourner; it makes the flashing water-drops
                     so many attendant mourners. It makes the Great Fall itself a mourner, and its
                     roar—a requiem!</p>
                  <p>The pleasure of travel is cut short. To one person of the little company of
                     fellow voyagers, you bid adieu with regret; pride, love, and hope point toward
                     her, while all the gentler affections stray back to the broken home. Her smile
                     of parting is very gracious, but it is not after all, such smile as your warm
                     heart pines for.</p>
                  <p>Ten days after, you are walking toward the old homestead, with such feelings as
                     it never called up before. In the days of boyhood, there were triumphant
                     thoughts of the gladness, and the pride, with which, when grown to the stature
                     of manhood, you would come back to that little town of your birth. As you have
                     bent with your dreamy resolutions over the tasks of the cloister life, swift
                     thoughts have flocked on you of the proud step, and prouder heart, with which
                     you would one day greet the old acquaintances of boyhood; and you have regaled
                     yourself on the jaunty manner with which you would meet old Dr. Bidlow; and the
                     patronizing air, with which you would address the pretty, blue-eyed Madge.</p>
                  <p>It is late afternoon when you come in sight of the tall sycamores that shade
                     your home; you shudder now lest you may meet any whom you once knew. The first,
                     keen grief of youth seeks little of the sympathy of companions: it lies—with a
                     sensitive man,—bounded within the narrowest circles of the heart. They only who
                     hold the key to its innermost recesses can speak consolation. Years will make a
                     change;—as the summer grows in fierce heats, the balminess of the violet banks
                     of Spring, is lost in the odors of a<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7259-00000084"/>
                     thousand flowers;—the heart, as it gains in age, loses freshness, but wins
                     breadth.</p>
                  <p>——Throw a pebble into the brook at its source, and the agitation is terrible,
                     and the ripples chafe madly their narrowed banks;—throw in a pebble, when the
                     brook has become a river, and you see a few circles, widening, and widening,
                     and widening, until they are lost in the gentle, every-day murmur of its
                     life!</p>
                  <p>You draw your hat over your eyes, as you walk toward the familiar door; the
                     yard is silent; the night is falling gloomily; a few katydids are crying in the
                     trees. The mother's window, where—at such a season as this, it was her custom
                     to sit watching your play, is shut; and the blinds are closed over it. The
                     honeysuckle which grew over the window, and which she loved so much, has flung
                     out its branches carelessly; and the spiders have hung their foul nets upon its
                     tendrils.</p>
                  <p>And she, who made that home so dear to your boyhood,—so real to your after
                     years,—standing amid all the flights of your youthful ambition, and your paltry
                     cares (for they seem paltry now) and your doubts, and anxieties and weaknesses
                     of heart, like the light of your hope—burning ever there, under the shadow of
                     the sycamores,—a holy beacon, by whose guidance you always came to a sweet
                     haven, and to a refuge from all your toils,—is gone,——gone forever!</p>
                  <p>The father is there indeed;—beloved, respected esteemed; but the boyish heart,
                     whose old life is now reviving, leans more readily, and more kindly into that
                     void, where once beat the heart of a mother.</p>
                  <p>Nelly is there;—cherished now with all the added love that is stricken off from
                     her who has left you forever. Nelly meets you at the door.</p>
                  <p>——"Clarence!"</p>
                  <p>——"Nelly!"</p>
                  <p>There are no other words; but you feel her tears, as the kiss of welcome is
                     given. With your hand joined in her's, you walk down the hall, into the old,
                     familiar room;—not with the jaunty, college step,—not with any presumption on
                     your dawning manhood,—oh, no,—nothing of this!</p>
                  <p>Quietly, meekly, feeling your whole heart shattered, and your mind feeble as a
                     boy's, and your purposes nothing, and worse than nothing,—with only one proud
                     feeling, you fling your arm around the form of that gentle sister,—the pride of
                     a protector;—the feeling—"<emph>I</emph> will care for you now, dear
                     Nelly!"—that is all. And even that, proud as it is, brings weakness.</p>
                  <p>You sit down together upon the lounge; Nelly buries her face in her hands,
                     sobbing.</p>
                  <p>"Dear Nelly," and your arm clasps her more fondly.</p>
                  <p>There is a cricket in the corner of the room, chirping very loudly. It seems as
                     if nothing else were living—<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7259-00000085"/> only
                     Nelly, Clarence, and the noisy cricket. Your eye falls on the chair where she
                     used to sit; it is drawn up with the same care as ever, beside the fire.</p>
                  <p>"I am <emph>so</emph> glad to see you, Clarence," says Nelly, recovering
                     herself; and there is a sweet, sad smile now. And sitting there beside you, she
                     tells you of it all;—of the day, and of the hour;—and how she looked,—and of
                     her last prayer, and how happy she was.</p>
                  <p>"And did she leave no message for me, Nelly?"</p>
                  <p>"Not to forget us, Clarence; but you could not!"</p>
                  <p>"Thank you, Nelly; and was there nothing else?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Clarence;—to meet her, one day?"</p>
                  <p>You only press her hand.</p>
                  <p>Presently your father comes in: he greets you with far more than his usual
                     cordiality. He keeps your hand a long time, looking quietly in your face, as if
                     he were reading traces of some resemblance, that had never struck him
                     before.</p>
                  <p>The father is one of those calm, impassive men, who shows little upon the
                     surface, and whose feelings you have always thought, cold. But now, there is a
                     tremulousness in his tones that you never remember observing before. He seems
                     conscious of it himself, and forbears talking. He goes to his old seat, and
                     after gazing at you a little while with the same steadfastness as at first,
                     leans forward, and buries his face in his hands.</p>
                  <p>From that very moment, you feel a sympathy, and a love for him, that you have
                     never known till then. And in after years, when suffering or trial come over
                     you, and when your thoughts fly, as to a refuge, to that shattered home, you
                     will recal that stooping image of the father,—with his head bowed, and from
                     time to time trembling convulsively with grief,—and feel that there remains yet
                     by the household fires, a heart of kindred love, and of kindred sorrow!</p>
                  <p>Nelly steals away from you gently, and stepping across the room, lays her hand
                     upon his shoulder, with a touch, that says, as plainly as words could say
                     it;—"We are here, Father!"</p>
                  <p>And he rouses himself,—passes his arm around her;—looks in her face
                     fondly,—draws her to him, and prints a kiss upon her forehead.</p>
                  <p>"Nelly, we must love each other now, more than ever."</p>
                  <p>Nelly's lips tremble, but she cannot answer; a tear or two go stealing down her
                     cheek.</p>
                  <p>You approach them; and your father takes your hand again, with a firm
                     grasp,—looks at you thoughtfully,—drops his eyes upon the fire, and for a
                     moment there is a pause;—"We are quite alone, now, my boy!"</p>
                  <p>——It is a Broken Home!</p>

                  <p>GRIEF has a strange power in opening the hearts of those who sorrow in common.
                     The father, who has seemed to you, not so much neglectful, as careless of your
                     aims, and purposes;—toward whom there have been in your younger years,
                     yearnings of affection, which his chilliness of manner has seemed to repress,
                     now grows under the sad light of the broken household, into a friend. The heart
                     feels a joy, it cannot express, in its freedom to love and to cherish. There is
                     a pleasure wholly new to you, in telling him of your youthful projects, in
                     listening to his questionings, in seeking his opinions, and in yielding to his
                     judgment.</p>
                  <p>It is a sad thing for the child, and quite as sad for the parent, when this
                     confidence is unknown. Many and many a time, with a bursting heart, you have
                     longed to tell him of some boyish grief, or to ask his guidance out of some
                     boyish trouble; but at the first sight of that calm, inflexible face, and at
                     the first sound of his measured words,—your enthusiastic yearnings toward his
                     love, and his counsels, have all turned back upon your eager, and sorrowing
                     heart; and you have gone away to hide in secret, the tears, which the lack of
                     his sympathy has wrung from your soul.</p>
                  <p>But now, over the tomb of her, for whom you weep in common, there is a new
                     light breaking; and your only fear is, lest you weary him with what may seem a
                     barren show of your confidence.</p>
                  <p>Nelly, too, is nearer now than ever; and with her, you have no fears of your
                     extravagance; you listen delightfully there, by the evening flame, to all that
                     she tells you of the neighbors of your boyhood. You shudder somewhat at her
                     genial praises of the blue-eyed Madge;—a shudder that you can hardly account
                     for, and which you do not seek to explain. It may be, that there is a clinging
                     and tender memory yet—wakened by the home atmosphere—of the divided
                     sixpence.</p>
                  <p>Of your quondam friend Frank, the pleasant recollection of whom revives again
                     under the old roof-tree, she tells you very little; and that little in a
                        hesitating,<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7259-00000087"/> and indifferent way
                     that utterly surprises you. Can it be, you think, that there has been some
                     cause of unkindness?</p>
                  <p>——Clarence is still very young!</p>
                  <p>The fire glows warmly upon the accustomed hearthstone; and—save that vacant
                     place, never to be filled again—a home cheer reigns even in this time of your
                     mourning. The spirit of the lost parent seems to linger over the remnant of the
                     household; and the Bible upon its stand—the book she loved so well—the book so
                     sadly forgotten,—seems still to open on you its promises, in her sweet tones;
                     and to call you, as it were, with her angel voice, to the land that she
                     inherits.</p>
                  <p>And when late night has come, and the household is quiet, you call up in the
                     darkness of your chamber, that other night of grief, which followed upon the
                     death of Charlie. That was the boy's vision of death; and this is the youthful
                     vision. Yet essentially, there is but little difference. Death levels the
                     capacities of the living, as it levels the strength of its victims. It is as
                     grand to the man, as to the boy: its teachings are as deep for age, as for
                     infancy.</p>
                  <p>You may learn its manner, and estimate its approaches; but when it comes, it
                     comes always with the same awful front that it wore to your boyhood. Reason and
                     Revelation may point to rich issues that unfold from its very darkness; yet all
                     these are no more to your bodily sense, and no more to your enlightened hope,
                     than those foreshadowings of peace, which rest like a halo, on the spirit of
                     the child, as he prays in guileless tones,—OUR FATHER, WHO ART IN HEAVEN!</p>
                  <p>It is a holy, and a placid grief that comes over you;—not crushing, but
                     bringing to life from the grave of boyhood, all its better and nobler
                     instincts. In their light, your wild plans of youth look sadly misshapen; and
                     in the impulse of the hour you abandon them; holy resolutions beam again upon
                     your soul like sunlight; your purposes seem bathed in goodness. There is an
                     effervescence of the spirit, that carries away all foul matter, and leaves you
                     in a state of calm, that seems kindred to the land and to the life, whither the
                     sainted mother has gone.</p>
                  <p>This calm brings a smile in the middle of tears, and an inward looking, and
                     leaning toward that Eternal Power which governs and guides us;—with that smile
                     and that leaning, sleep comes like an angelic minister, and fondles your
                     wearied frame, and thought, into that repose which is the mirror of the
                     Destroyer.</p>
                  <p>——Poor Clarence, he is like the rest of the world,—whose goodness lies chiefly
                     in the occasional throbs<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7259-00000088"/> of a better
                     nature, which soon subside, and leave them upon the old level of
                        <emph>desire.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>As you lie between waking and sleeping, you have a fancy of a sound at your
                     door;—it seems to open softly; and the tall figure of your father wrapped in
                     his dressing-gown stands over you, and gazes—as he gazed at you before;—his
                     look is very mournful; and he murmurs your mother's name; and—sighs; and—looks
                     again; and passes out.</p>
                  <p>At morning, you cannot tell if it was real, or a dream. Those higher resolves
                     too, which grief, and the night made, seem very vague and shadowy. Life with
                     its ambitious, and cankerous desires wakes again. You do not feel them at
                     first; the subjugation of holy thoughts, and of reaches toward the Infinite,
                     leave their traces on you, and perhaps bewilder you into a half consciousness
                     of strength. But at the first touch of the grosser elements about you;—on your
                     very first entrance upon those duties which quicken pride or shame, and which
                     are pointing at you from every quarter,—your holy calm, your high-born
                     purpose,—your spiritual cleavings pass away, like the electricity of August
                     storms, drawn down by the thousand glittering turrets of a city!</p>
                  <p>The world is stronger than the night; and the bindings of sense are ten-fold
                     stronger than the most exquisite delirium of soul. This makes you feel, or will
                     one day make you feel, that life,—strong life and sound life,—that life which
                     lends approaches to the Infinite, and takes hold on Heaven, is not so much a
                     PROGRESS, as it is a RESISTANCE!</p>
                  <p>There is one special confidence, which in all your talk about plans, and
                     purposes, you do not give to your father; you reserve that for the ear of Nelly
                     alone. Why happens it, that a father is almost the last confidant that a son
                     makes in any matter deeply affecting the feelings? Is it the fear that a father
                     may regard such matter as boyish? Is it a lingering suspicion of your own
                     childishness; or of that extreme of affection which reduces you to
                     childishness?</p>
                  <p>Why is it always, that a man of whatever age or condition, forbears to exhibit
                     to those, whose respect for his judgment, and mental abilities he seeks only,
                     the most earnest qualities of the heart, and those intenser susceptibilities of
                     love, which underlie his nature, and which give a color, in spite of him, to
                     the habit of his life? Why is he so morbidly anxious to keep out of sight any
                     extravagances of affection, when he blurts officiously to the world, his
                     extravagances of action, and of thought? Can any lover explain me this?</p>
                  <p>Again, why is a sister, the one of all others, to whom you first whisper the
                     dawnings of any strong emotion;—as if it were a weakness, that her charity
                     alone could cover?</p>
                  <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7259-00000089"/>
                  <p>However this may be, you have a long story for Nelly's ear. It is some days
                     after your return: you are strolling down a quiet, wooded lane—a remembered
                     place,—when you first open to her your heart. Your talk is of Laura Dalton. You
                     describe her to Nelly, with the extravagance of a glowing hope. You picture
                     those qualities that have attracted you most; you dwell upon her beauty, her
                     elegant figure, her grace of conversation, her accomplishments. You make a
                     study that feeds your passion, as you go on. You rise by the very glow of your
                     speech into a frenzy of feeling, that she has never excited before. You are
                     quite sure that you would be wretched, and miserable, without her.</p>
                  <p>"Do you mean to marry her?" says Nelly.</p>
                  <p>It is a question that gives a swift bound to the blood of youth. It involves
                     the idea of possession; and of the dependance of the cherished one upon your
                     own arm, and strength. But the admiration you entertain, seems almost too lofty
                     for this; Nelly's question makes you diffident of reply; and you lose yourself
                     in a new story of those excellencies of speech, and of figure, which have so
                     charmed you.</p>
                  <p>Nelly's eye, on a sudden, becomes full of tears.</p>
                  <p>——"What is it, Nelly?"</p>
                  <p>"Our mother; Clarence."</p>
                  <p>The word, and the thought dampen your ardor; the sweet watchfulness, and gentle
                     kindness of that parent, for an instant, make a sad contrast with the showy
                     qualities you have been naming; and the spirit of that mother—called up by
                     Nelly's words—seems to hang over you, with an anxious love, that subdues all
                     your pride of passion.</p>
                  <p>But this passes; and now,—half believing that Nelly's thoughts have run over
                     the same ground with yours,—you turn special pleader for your fancy. You argue
                     for the beauty, which you just now affirmed; you do your utmost to win over
                     Nelly to some burst of admiration. Yet there she sits beside you, thoughtfully,
                     and half sadly, playing with the frail autumn flowers that grow at her side.
                     What can she be thinking? You ask it by a look.</p>
                  <p>She smiles,—takes your hand, for she will not let you grow angry,—</p>
                  <p>"I was thinking, Clarence, whether this Laura Dalton, would after all, make a
                     good wife,—such an one as you would love always?"</p>

                  <head>VII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A GOOD WIFE.</head>
                  <p>THE thought of Nelly suggests new dreams, that are little apt to find place in
                     the rhapsodies of a youthful lover. The very epithet of a good wife, mates
                     tamely with the romantic fancies of a first passion. It is measuring the ideal
                     by too practical a standard. It sweeps away all the delightful vagueness of a
                     fairy dream of love, and reduces one to a dull, and economic estimate of actual
                     qualities. Passion lives above all analysis and estimate, and arrives at its
                     conclusions by intuition.</p>
                  <p>Did Petrarch ever think if Laura would make a good wife; did Oswald ever think
                     it of Corinne? Nay, did even the more practical Waverley, ever think it of the
                     impassioned Flora? Would it not weaken faith in their romantic passages, if you
                     believed it? What have such vulgar, practical issues to do with that passion
                     which sublimates the faculties, and makes the loving dreamer to live in an
                     ideal sphere, where nothing but goodness and brightness can come?</p>
                  <p>Nelly is to be pitied for entertaining such a thought; and yet Nelly is very
                     good, and kind. Her affections are, without doubt, all centred in the remnant
                     of the shattered home: she has never known any further, and deeper love,—never
                     once fancied it even——</p>
                  <p>——Ah, Clarence, you are very young!</p>
                  <p>And yet there are some things that puzzle you in Nelly. You have found,
                     accidentally, in one of her treasured books,—a book that lies almost always on
                     her dressing table,—a little withered flower, with its stem in a slip of paper;
                     and on the paper the initials of—your old friend Frank. You recall, in
                     connection with this, her indisposition to talk of him on the first evening of
                     your return. It seems,—you scarce know why—that these are the tokens of
                     something very like a leaning of the heart. It does occur to you, that she too,
                     may have her little casket of loves; and you try one day, very adroitly, to
                     take a look into this casket.</p>
                  <p>——You will learn, later in life, that the heart of a modest, gentle girl, is a
                     very hard matter, for even a brother to probe: it is at once the most tender,
                     and the most unapproachable of all fastnesses. It admits<pb n="180-181"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000091"/> feeling, by armies, with great trains of
                     artillery,—but not a single scout. It is as calm and pure as polar snows; but
                     deep underneath, where no footsteps have gone, and where no eye can reach, but
                     one, lies the warm, and the throbbing earth.</p>
                  <p>Make what you will of the slight, quivering blushes, and of the half-broken
                     expressions,—more you cannot get. The love that a delicate-minded girl will
                     tell, is a short sighted, and outside love; but the love that she cherishes
                     without voice or token, is a love that will mould her secret sympathies, and
                     her deepest, fondest yearnings, either to a quiet world of joy, or to a world
                     of placid sufferance. The true voice of her love she will keep back long and
                     late, fearful ever of her most prized jewel,—fearful to strange sensitiveness:
                     she will show kindness, but the opening of the real flood-gates of the heart,
                     and the utterance of those impassioned yearnings, which belong to its nature,
                     come far later. And fearful, thrice fearful is the shock, if these flow out
                     unmet!</p>
                  <p>That deep, thrilling voice bearing all the perfume of the womanly soul in its
                     flow, rarely finds utterance; and if uttered vainly,—if called out by tempting
                     devices, and by a trust that is abused,—desolate indeed is the maiden
                     heart,—widowed of its chastest thought! The soul shrinks affrighted within
                     itself. Like a tired bird, lost at sea,—fluttering around what seem friendly
                     boughs, it stoops at length, and finding only cold, slippery spars, with no
                     bloom and no foliage—its last hope gone—it sinks to a wild, ocean grave!</p>
                  <p>Nelly—and the thought brings a tear of sympathy to your eye—must have such a
                     heart: it speaks in every shadow of her action. And this very delicacy seems to
                     lend her a charm, that would make her a wife, to be loved and honored.</p>
                  <p>Aye, there is something in that maidenly modesty, retiring from you, as you
                     advance,—retreating timidly from all bold approaches, fearful and yet joyous,
                     which wins upon the iron hardness of a man's nature, like a rising flame. To
                     force of action and resolve, he opposes force: to strong will, he mates his
                     own: pride lights pride; but to the gentleness of the true womanly character,
                     he yields with a gush of tenderness that nothing else can call out. He will
                     never be subjugated on his own ground of action and energy; but let him be
                     lured to that border country, over which the delicacy, and fondness of a
                     womanly nature presides, and his energy yields, his haughty determination
                     faints,—he is proud of submission!</p>
                  <p>And with this thought of modesty, and gentleness to illuminate your dream of an
                     ideal wife, you chase the pleasant phantom to that shadowy home,—lying far off
                     in the future,—of which she is the glory, and the crown. I know it is the
                     fashion now-a-days with many,<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7259-00000092"/> to
                     look for a woman's excellencies, and influence,—away from her home; but I know
                     too, that a vast many eager, and hopeful hearts, still cherish the belief that
                     her virtues will range highest, and live longest within those sacred walls.</p>
                  <p>Where indeed, can the modest and earnest virtue of a woman, tell a stronger
                     story of its worth, than upon the dawning habit of a child? Where can her grace
                     of character win a higher, and a riper effect, than upon the action of her
                     household? What mean those noisy declaimers who talk of the feeble influence,
                     and of the crushed faculties of a woman?</p>
                  <p>What school of learning, or of moral endeavor, depends more on its teacher,
                     than the home upon the mother? What influence of all the world's professors,
                     and teachers, tells so strongly on the habit of a man's mind, as those gentle
                     droppings from a mother's lips, which, day by day, and hour by hour, grow into
                     the enlarging stature of his soul, and live with it forever? They can hardly be
                     mother's, who aim at a broader, and noisier field: they have forgotten to be
                     daughters: they must needs have lost the hope of being wives!</p>
                  <p>Be this how it may, the heart of a man, with whom affection is not a name, and
                     love a mere passion of the hour, yearns toward the quiet of a home, as toward
                     the goal of his earthly joy, and hope. And as you fasten there, your thought,
                     an indulgent, yet dreamy fancy paints the loved image that is to adorn it, and
                     to make it sacred.</p>
                  <p>——She is there to bid you—God speed!—and an adieu, that hangs like music on
                     your ear, as you go out to the every day labor of life. At evening, she is
                     there to greet you, as you come back wearied with a day's toil; and her look so
                     full of gladness, cheats you of your fatigue; and she steals her arm around
                     you, with a soul of welcome, that beams like sunshine on her brow and that
                     fills your eye with tears of a twin gratitude—to her, and Heaven!</p>
                  <p>She is not unmindful of those old-fashioned virtues of cleanliness, and of
                     order, which give an air of quiet, and which secure content. Your wants are all
                     anticipated; the fire is burning brightly; the clean hearth flashes under the
                     joyous blaze; the old elbow chair is in its place. Your very unworthiness of
                     all this haunts you like an accusing spirit, and yet penetrates your heart with
                     a new devotion, toward the loved one who is thus watchful of your comfort.</p>
                  <p>She is gentle;—keeping your love, as she has won it, by a thousand nameless and
                     modest virtues, which radiate from her whole life and action. She steals upon
                     your affections like a summer wind breathing softly over sleeping valleys. She
                     gains a mastery over your sterner nature, by very contrast; and wins you
                     unwittingly to her lightest wish. And yet her wishes are<pb n="184-185"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000093"/> guided by that delicate tact, which avoids
                     conflict with your manly pride; she subdues, by seeming to yield. By a single
                     soft word of appeal, she robs your vexation of its anger; and with a slight
                     touch of that fair hand, and one pleading look of that earnest eye, she disarms
                     your sternest pride.</p>
                  <p>She is kind;—shedding her kindness, as Heaven sheds dew. Who indeed could doubt
                     it?—least of all, you, who are living on her kindness, day by day, as flowers
                     live on light? There is none of that officious parade, which blunts the point
                     of benevolence: but it tempers every action with a blessing. If trouble has
                     come upon you, she knows that her voice beguiling you into cheerfulness, will
                     lay your fears; and as she draws her chair beside you, she knows that the
                     tender and confiding way, with which she takes your hand, and looks up into
                     your earnest face, will drive away from your annoyance all its weight. As she
                     lingers, leading off your thought with pleasant words, she knows well that she
                     is redeeming you from care, and soothing you to that sweet calm, which such
                     home, and such wife can alone bestow. And in sickness,—sickness that you almost
                     covet for the sympathy it brings,—that hand of hers resting on your fevered
                     forehead, or those fingers playing with the scattered locks, are more full of
                     kindness than the loudest vaunt of friends; and when your failing strength will
                     permit no more, you grasp that cherished hand,—with a fullness of joy, of
                     thankfulness, and of love, which your tears only can tell.</p>
                  <p>She is good;—her hopes live, where the angels live. Her kindness and gentleness
                     are sweetly tempered with that meekness and forbearance which are born of
                     Faith. Trust comes into her heart, as rivers come to the sea. And in the dark
                     hours of doubt and foreboding, you rest fondly upon her buoyant Faith, as the
                     treasure of your common life; and in your holier musings, you look to that
                     frail hand, and that gentle spirit, to lead you away from the vanities of
                     worldly ambition, to the fullness of that joy, which the good inherit.</p>

                  <head>VIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A BROKEN HOPE.</head>
                  <p>YOUTHFUL passion is a giant. It overleaps all the dreams, and all the resolves
                     of our better and quieter nature; and drives madly toward some wild issue, that
                     lives only in its frenzy. How little account does passion take of goodness! It
                     is not within the cycle of its revolution: it is below: it is tamer: it is
                     older: it wears no wings.</p>
                  <p>And your proud heart flashing back to the memory of that sparkling eye, which
                     lighted your hope—full-fed upon the vanities of cloister learning, drives your
                     soberer visions to the wind. As you recal those tones, so full of brilliancy
                     and pride, the quiet virtues fade, like the soft haze upon a spring landscape,
                     driven westward by a swift, sea-born storm. The pulse bounds: the eyes flash:
                     the heart trembles with its sharp springs. Hope dilates, like the eye,—fed with
                     swift blood, leaping to the brain.</p>
                  <p>Again the image of Miss Dalton, so fine, so noble, so womanly, fills, and
                     bounds the Future. The lingering tears of grief drop away from your eye, as the
                     lingering loves of boyhood drop from your scalding passion, or drift into
                     clouds of vapor.</p>
                  <p>You listen to the calm, thoughtful advice of the father, with a deep
                     consciousness of something stronger than his counsels, seething in your bosom.
                     The words of caution, of instruction, of guidance, fall upon your heated
                     imagination, like the night-dews upon the crater of an Etna. They are
                     beneficent, and healthful for the straggling herbage upon the surface of the
                     mountain; but they do not reach, or temper the inner fires, that are rolling
                     their billows of flame, beneath!</p>
                  <p>You drop hints from time to time to those with whom you are most familiar, of
                     some prospective change of condition. There is a new and cheerful interest in
                     the building plans of your neighbors:—a new, and cheerful study of the
                     principles of domestic architecture;—in which, very elegant boudoirs, adorned
                     with harps, hold prominent place; and libraries with gilt-bound books, very
                     rich in lyrical, and dramatic poetry;—fine views from bay windows;—graceful
                     pots of flowers;—sleek looking Italian grey-hounds;—<pb n="188-189"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000095"/> cheerful sunlight;—musical goldfinches
                     chattering on the wall;—superb pictures of Princesses in peasant dresses;—soft
                     Axminster carpets;—easy-acting bell-pulls;—gigantic candelabras;—porcelain
                     vases of classic shape;—neat waiters in white aprons;—luxurious lounges; and,
                     to crown them all with the very height of your pride,—the elegant Laura, the
                     mistress, and the guardian of your soul—moving amid the scene, like a new
                     Duchess of Vallière!</p>
                  <p>You catch chance sights here and there, of the blue-eyed Madge: you see her, in
                     her mother's household, the earnest, and devoted daughter,—gliding gracefully
                     about her mother's cottage, the very type of gentleness, and of duty. Yet
                     withal, there are sparks of spirit in her, that pique your pride,—lofty as it
                     is. You offer flowers, which she accepts with a kind smile;—not of coquetry—but
                     of simplest thankfulness. She is not the girl to gratify your vanity with any
                     half-show of tenderness. And if there lived ever in her heart an old girlish
                     liking for the school-boy Clarence, it is all gone before the romantic lover of
                     the elegant Laura; or at most, it lies in some obscure corner of her soul,
                     never to be brought to light.</p>
                  <p>You enter upon the new pursuits, which your father has advised, with a lofty
                     consciousness,—not only of the strength of your mind, but of your heart. You
                     relieve your opening professional study, with long letters to Miss Dalton, full
                     of Shakspearean compliments, and touched off with very dainty elaboration. And
                     you receive pleasant, gossipping notes in answer,—full of quotations, but
                     meaning very little.</p>
                  <p>Youth is in a grand flush, like the hot days of ending summer; and pleasant
                     dreams thrall your spirit, like the smoky atmosphere that bathes the landscape
                     of an August day. Hope rides high in the Heavens, as when the summer sun mounts
                     nearest to the zenith. Youth feels the fullness of maturity, before the second
                     season of life is ended: yet is it a vain maturity, and all the glow is
                     deceitful. Those fruits that ripen in summer do not last. They are sweet; they
                     are glowing with gold; but they melt with a luscious sweetness upon the lip.
                     They do not give that strength, and nutriment, which will bear a man bravely
                     through the coming chills of winter.</p>
                  <p>The last scene of summer changes now to the cobwebbed ceiling of an attorney's
                     office. Books of law, scattered ingloriously at your elbow, speak dully to the
                     flush of your vanities. You are seated at your side desk, where you have
                     wrought at those heavy, mechanic labors of drafting, which go before a
                     knowledge of your craft.</p>
                  <p>A letter is by you, which you regard with strange feelings: it is yet unopened.
                     It comes from Laura. It<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7259-00000096"/> is in reply
                     to one which has cost you very much of exquisite elaboration. You have made
                     your avowal of feeling, as much like a poem, as your education would admit.
                     Indeed, it was a pretty letter,—promising, not so much the trustful love of an
                     earnest, and devoted heart,—as the fervor of a passion which consumed you, and
                     glowed like a furnace through the lines of your letter. It was a confession, in
                     which your vanity of intellect had taken very entertaining part; and in which,
                     your judgment was too cool to appear at all.</p>
                  <p>She must needs break out into raptures at such a letter; and her own, will
                     doubtless be tempered with even greater passion.</p>
                  <p>It is well to shift your chair somewhat, so that the clerks of the office may
                     not see your emotion as you read. It would be silly to manifest your exuberance
                     in a dismal, dark office of your instructing attorney. One sighs rather for
                     woods, and brooks, and sunshine, in whose company, the hopes of youth stretch
                     into fulfillment.</p>
                  <p>We will look only at a closing passage:—</p>

                              <p>——"My friend Clarence will I trust believe me, when I say that his
                                 letter was a surprise to me. To say that it was very grateful,
                                 would be what my womanly vanity could not fail to claim. I only
                                 wish that I was equal to the flattering portrait which he has
                                 drawn. I even half fancy that he is joking me, and can hardly
                                 believe that my matronly air should have quite won his youthful
                                 heart. At least I shall try not to believe it; and when I welcome
                                 him one day, the husband of some fairy, who is worthy of his love,
                                 we will smile together at the old lady, who once played the Circe
                                 to his senses. Seriously, my friend Clarence, I know your impulse
                                 of heart has carried you away: and that in a year's time, you will
                                 smile with me, at your old penchant for one so much your senior,
                                 and so ill-suited to your years, as your true friend,</p>

                  <p>——Magnificent Miss Dalton!</p>
                  <p>Read it again. Stick your knife in the desk:—tut!—you will break the blade!
                     Fold up the letter carefully, and toss it upon your pile of papers. Open Chitty
                     again;—pleasant reading is Chitty! Lean upon your hand—your two hands;—so that
                     no one will catch sight of your face. Chitty is very interesting;—how sparkling
                     and imaginative!—what a depth and flow of passion in Chitty!</p>
                  <p>The office is a capital place—so quiet and sunny. Law is a delightful study—so
                     captivating, and such stores of romance! And then those trips to the Hall offer
                     such relief and variety;—especially just now. It would be well not to betray
                     your eagerness to go. You can brush your hat a round or two, and take a<pb
                        n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7259-00000097"/> peep into the broken bit of
                     looking-glass, over the wash-stand.</p>
                  <p>You lengthen your walk, as you sometimes do, by a stroll upon the
                     Battery—though rarely, upon such a blustering November day. You put your hands
                     in your pockets, and look out upon the tossing sea.</p>
                  <p>It is a fine sight—very fine. There are few finer bays in the world than New
                     York bay; either to look at, or—for that matter—to sleep in. The ships ride up
                     thickly, dashing about the cold spray delightfully; the little cutters gleam in
                     the November sunshine, like white flowers shivering in the wind.</p>
                  <p>The sky is rich—all mottled with cold, gray streaks of cloud. The old
                     apple-women, with their noses frost-bitten, look cheerful, and blue. The ragged
                     immigrants in short-trowsers, and bell-crowned hats, stalk about with a very
                     happy expression, and very short stemmed pipes; their yellow-haired babies look
                     comfortably red, and glowing. And the trees with their scant, pinched foliage,
                     have a charming, summer-like effect!</p>
                  <p>Amid it all, the thoughts of the boudoir, and harpsichord, and gold-finches,
                     and Axminster carpets, and sunshine, and Laura, are so very—very pleasant! How
                     delighted you would be to see her married to the stout man in the red cravat,
                     who gave her bouquets, and strolled with her on the deck of the steamer upon
                     the St. Lawrence! What a jaunty, self-satisfied air he wore; and with what
                     considerate forbearance he treated you—calling you once or twice—Master
                     Clarence! It never occurred to you before, how much you must be indebted to
                     that pleasant, stout man.</p>
                  <p>You try sadly to be cheerful; you smile oddly; your pride comes strongly to
                     your help, but yet helps you very little. It is not so much a broken heart,
                     that you have to mourn over, as a broken dream. You seem to see in a hundred
                     ways that had never occurred to you before, the marks of her superior age.
                     Above all, it is manifest in the cool, and unimpassioned tone of her letter.
                     Yet, how kindly, withal! It would be a relief to be angry.</p>
                  <p>New visions come to you, wakened by the broken fancy which has just now eluded
                     your grasp. You will make yourself, if not old,—at least, gifted with the force
                     and dignity of age. You will be a man; and build no more castles, until you can
                     people them with men! In an excess of pride, you even take umbrage at the sex;
                     they can have little appreciation of that engrossing tenderness, of which you
                     feel yourself to be capable. Love shall henceforth be dead, and you will live
                     boldly without it.</p>
                  <p>——Just so, when some dark, eastern cloud-bank shrouds for a morning, the sun of
                     later August, we say in our shivering pride—the winter is come early!<pb
                        n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7259-00000098"/> But God manages the seasons better
                     than we; and in a day, or an hour perhaps, the cloud will pass, and the heavens
                     glow again upon our ungrateful heads.</p>
                  <p>Well, it is even so, that the passionate dreams of youth break up, and wither.
                     Vanity becomes tempered with wholesome pride; and passion yields to the riper
                     judgment of manhood;—even as the August heats pass on, and over, into the
                     genial glow of a September sun. There is a strong growth in the struggles
                     against mortified pride; and then only, does the youth get an ennobling
                     consciousness of that manhood which is dawning in him, when he has fairly
                     surmounted those puny vexations, which a wounded vanity creates.</p>
                  <p>Now, your heart is driven home;—and that cherished place, where, so little
                     while ago, you wore your vanities with an air, that mocked even your grief, and
                     that subdued your better nature, seems to stretch toward you, over long miles
                     of distance,—its wings of love; and to welcome back to the sister's, and the
                     father's heart—not the self-sufficient, and vaunting youth,—but the brother and
                     son,—the school-boy, Clarence. Like a thirsty child, you stray in thought, to
                     that fountain of cheer; and live again,—your vanity crushed, your wild hope
                     broken,—in the warm, and natural affections of the boyish home.</p>
                  <p>Clouds weave the SUMMER into the season of AUTUMN: and YOUTH rises from dashed
                     hopes, into the stature of a MAN.</p>

               <head>DREAMS OF MANHOOD.</head>
               <head>AUTUMN.</head>
               <p>THERE are those who shudder at the approach of Autumn; and who feel a light grief
                  stealing over their spirits, like an October haze, as the evening shadows slant
                  sooner, and longer, over the face of an ending August day.</p>
               <p>But is not Autumn the Manhood of the year? Is it not the ripest of the seasons? Do
                  not proud flowers blossom;—the golden rod, the orchis, the dahlia, and the bloody
                  cardinal of the swamp-lands?</p>
               <p>The fruits too are golden, hanging heavy from the tasked trees. The fields of
                  maize show weeping spindles, and broad rustling leaves, and ears, half glowing
                  with the crowded corn; the September wind whistles over their thick-set ranks,
                  with whispers of<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7259-00000101"/> plenty. The staggering
                  stalks of the buck-wheat, grow red with ripeness; and tip their tops with
                  clustering, tri-cornered kernels.</p>
               <p>The cattle loosed from the summer's yoke, grow strong upon the meadows, new
                  starting from the scythe. The lambs of April, rounded into fullness of limb, and
                  gaining day by day their woolly cloak, bite at the nodding clover-heads; or, with
                  their noses to the ground, they stand in solemn, circular conclave, under the
                  pasture oaks, while the noon sun beats with the lingering passion of July.</p>
               <p>The Bob-o'-Lincolns have come back from their Southern rambles among the rice, all
                  speckled with gray; and—singing no longer as they did in Spring,—they quietly feed
                  upon the ripened reeds, that straggle along the borders of the walls. The larks,
                  with their black and yellow breast-plates, and lifted heads, stand tall upon the
                  close-mown meadow; and at your first motion of approach, spring up, and soar away,
                  and light again; and with their lifted heads, renew the watch. The quails, in
                  half-grown coveys, saunter hidden, through the underbrush that skirts the wood;
                  and only when you are close upon them, whir away, and drop scattered under the
                  coverts of the forest.</p>
               <p>The robins, long ago deserting the garden neighborhood, feed at eventide, in
                  flocks, upon the bloody berries of the sumac; and the soft-eyed pigeons dispute
                  possession of the feast. The squirrels chatter at sun-rise, and gnaw off the
                  full-grown burs of the chesnuts. The lazy black-birds skip after the loitering
                  cow, watchful of the crickets, that her slow steps start to danger. The crows, in
                  companies, caw aloft; and hang high over the carcase of some slaughtered sheep,
                  lying ragged upon the hills.</p>
               <p>The ash trees grow crimson in color, and lose their summer life in great gouts of
                  blood. The birches touch their frail spray with yellow; the chesnuts drop down
                  their leaves in brown, twirling showers. The beeches crimped with the frost, guard
                  their foliage, until each leaf whistles white, in the November gales. The
                  bitter-sweet hangs its bare, and leaf-less tendrils from rock to tree, and sways
                  with the weight of its brazen berries. The sturdy oaks, unyielding to the winds,
                  and to the frosts, struggle long against the approaches of the winter; and in
                  their struggles, wear faces of orange, of scarlet, of crimson, and of brown; and
                  finally, yielding to swift winds,—as youth's pride yields to manly duty,—strew the
                  ground with the scattered glories of their summer strength; and warm, and feed the
                  earth, with the debris of their leafy honors.</p>
               <p>The maple, in the low-lands, turns suddenly its silvery greenness into orange
                  scarlet; and in the coming chilliness of the Autumn eventide, seems to catch the
                  glories of the sunset; and to wear them—<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7259-00000102"
                  /> as a sign of God's old promise in Egypt,—like a pillar of cloud, by day,—and of
                  fire, by night.</p>
               <p>And when all these are done;—and in the paved, and noisy aisles of the city, the
                  ailanthus; with all its greenness gone,—lifts up its skeleton fingers to the God
                  of Autumn and of storms,—the dog-wood still guards its crown; and the branches
                  which stretched their white canvass in April, now bear up a spire of bloody
                  tongues, that lie against the leafless woods, like a tree on fire!</p>
               <p>Autumn brings to the home, the cheerful glow of 'first fires.' It withdraws the
                  thoughts from the wide and joyous landscape of summer, and fixes them upon those
                  objects which bloom, and rejoice within the household. The old hearth that has
                  rioted the summer through with boughs and blossoms, gives up its withered
                  tenantry. The fire-dogs gleam kindly upon the evening hours; and the blaze wakens
                  those sweet hopes, and prayers, which cluster around the fireside of home.</p>
               <p>The wanton and the riot of the season gone, are softened in memory, and supply
                  joys to the season to come;—just as youth's audacity and pride, give a glow to the
                  recollections of our manhood.</p>
               <p>At mid-day, the air is mild and soft; a warm, blue smoke lies in the mountain
                  gaps; the tracery of distant woods upon the upland, hangs in the haze, with a
                  dreamy gorgeousness of coloring. The river runs low with August drought; and frets
                  upon the pebbly bottom, with a soft, low murmur,—as of joyousness gone by. The
                  hemlocks of the river bank, rise in tapering sheens, and tell tales of Spring.</p>
               <p>As the sun sinks, doubling his disc in the October smoke, the low, south wind
                  creeps over the withered tree-tops, and drips the leaves upon the land. The
                  windows that were wide open at noon, are closed; and a bright blaze—to drive off
                  the Eastern dampness, that promises a storm,—flashes lightly, and kindly, over the
                  book-shelves and busts, upon my wall.</p>
               <p>As the sun sinks lower, and lower, his red beams die in a sea of great, gray
                  clouds. Slowly, and quietly, they creep up over the night-sky. Venus is shrouded.
                  The Western stars blink faintly,—then fade in the mounting vapors. The vane points
                  East of South. The constellations in the Zenith, struggle to be seen;—but
                  presently give over, and hide their shining.</p>
               <p>By late lamp-light, the sky is all gray and dark: the vane has turned two points
                  nearer east. The clouds spit fine rain-drops, that you only feel, with your face
                  turned to the heavens. But soon, they grow thicker and heavier; and, as I sit,
                  watching the blaze, and——dreaming——they patter thick and fast under the driving
                  wind, upon the window,—like the swift tread of an army of MEN!</p>

                  <head type="sub">PRIDE OF MANLINESS.</head>
                  <p>AND has manhood no dreams? Does the soul wither at that Rubicon, which lies
                     between the Gallic country of youth, and the Rome of manliness? Does not fancy
                     still love to cheat the heart, and weave gorgeous tissues to hang upon that
                     horizon, which lies along the years that are to come? Is happiness so
                     exhausted, that no new forms of it lie in the mines of imagination, for busy
                     hopes to drag up to-day?</p>
                  <p>Where then would live the motives to an upward looking of the eye, and of the
                     soul;—where, the beckonings that bid us ever—onward?</p>
                  <p>But these later dreams, are not the dreams of fond boyhood, whose eye sees
                     rarely below the surface of things; nor yet the delicious hopes of
                     sparkling-blooded blooded youth: they are dreams of sober trustfulness, of
                     practical results, of hard-wrought world-success, and—may be—of Love and of
                     Joy.</p>
                  <p>Ambitious forays do not rest, where they rested once: hitherto, the balance of
                     youth has given you, in all that you have dreamed of accomplishment,—a strong
                     vantage against age: hitherto, in all your estimates, you have been able to
                     multiply them by that access of thought, and of strength, which manhood would
                     bring to you. Now, this is forever ended.</p>
                  <p>There is a great meaning in that word—manhood. It covers all human growth. It
                     supposes no extensions, or increase; it is integral, fixed, perfect—the whole.
                     There is no getting beyond manhood; it is much to live up to it; but once
                     reached, you are all that a man was made to be, in this world.</p>
                  <p>It is a strong thought—that a man is perfected, so far as strength goes;—that
                     he will never be abler to do his work, than under the very sun which is now
                     shining on him. There is a seriousness, that few call to mind, in the
                     reflection, that whatever you do in this age of manhood, is an unalterable type
                     of your whole bigness. You may qualify particulars of your character, by
                     refinements, by special studies, and practice; but,—once a man,—and there is no
                     more manliness to be lived for!</p>
                  <p>This thought kindles your soul to new, and swifter<pb n="206-207"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000104"/> dreams of ambition than belonged to youth. They
                     were toys; these are weapons. They were fancies; these are motives. The soul
                     begins to struggle with the dust, the sloth, the circumstance, that beleaguer
                     humanity, and to stagger into the van of action.</p>
                  <p>Perception, whose limits lay along a narrow horizon, now tops that horizon, and
                     spreads, and reaches toward the heaven of the Infinite. The mind feels its
                     birth, and struggles toward the great birth-master. The heart glows: its
                     humanities even, yield and crimple under the fierce heat of mental pride. Vows
                     leap upward, and pile rampart upon rampart, to scale all the degrees of human
                     power.</p>
                  <p>Are there not times in every man's life when there flashes on him a
                     feeling—nay, more, an absolute conviction,—that this soul is but a spark
                     belonging to some upper fire; and that by as much as we draw near by effort, by
                     resolve, by intensity of endeavor, to that upper fire,—by so much, we draw
                     nearer to our home, and mate ourselves with angels? Is there not a ringing
                     desire in many minds to seize hold of what floats above us in the universe of
                     thought, and drag down what shreds we can, to scatter to the world? Is it not
                     belonging to greatness, to catch lightning, from the plains where lightning
                     lives, and curb it, for the handling of men?</p>
                  <p>Resolve is what makes a man manliest;—not puny resolve, not crude
                     determination, not errant purpose,—but that strong, and indefatigable will,
                     which treads down difficulties and danger, as a boy treads down the heaving
                     frost-lands of winter;—which kindles his eye and brain, with a proud pulse-beat
                     toward the unattainable. Will makes men giants. It made Napoleon an Emperor of
                     kings,—Bacon a fathomer of nature,—Byron a tutor of passion, and the martyrs,
                     masters of Death!</p>
                  <p>In this age of manhood, you look back upon the dreams of the years that are
                     past; they glide to the vision in pompous procession; they seem bloated with
                     infancy. They are without sinew or bone. They do not bear the hard touches of
                     the man's hand.</p>
                  <p>It is not long, to be sure, since the summer of life ended with that broken
                     hope; but the few years that lie between have given long steps upward. The
                     little grief that threw its shadow, and the broken vision that deluded you,
                     have made the passing years long, in such feeling as ripens manhood. Nothing
                     lays the brown of autumn upon the green of summer, so quick as storms.</p>
                  <p>There have been changes too in the home scenes; these graft age upon a man.
                     Nelly—your sweet Nelly of childhood, your affectionate sister of youth, has
                     grown out of the old brotherly companionship into the new dignity of a
                     household.</p>
                  <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7259-00000105"/>
                  <p>The fire flames and flashes upon the accustomed hearth. The father's chair is
                     there in the wonted corner; he himself—we must call him the old man now, though
                     his head shows few white honors—wears a calmness and a trust that light the
                     failing eye. Nelly is not away; Nelly is a wife; and the husband yonder, as you
                     may have dreamed,—your old friend Frank.</p>
                  <p>Her eye is joyous; her kindness to you is unabated; her care for you is quicker
                     and wiser. But yet the old unity of the household seems broken; nor can all her
                     winning attentions bring back the feeling which lived in Spring, under the
                     garret roof.</p>
                  <p>The isolation, the unity, the integrity of manhood, make a strong prop for the
                     mind; but a weak one for the heart. Dignity can but poorly fill up that chasm
                     of the soul, which the home affections once occupied. Life's duties, and honors
                     press hard upon the bosom, that once throbbed at a mother's tones, and that
                     bounded in a mother's smiles.</p>
                  <p>In such home, the strength you boast of, seems a weakness; manhood leans into
                     childish memories, and melts—as Autumn frosts yield to a soft, south wind,
                     coming from a Tropic spring. You feel in a desert where you once felt at
                     home—in a bounded landscape,—that was once—the world!</p>
                  <p>The tall sycamores have dwindled to paltry trees: the hills that were so large,
                     and lay at such grand distance to the eye of childhood, are now near by, and
                     have fallen away to mere rolling waves of upland. The garden fence that was so
                     gigantic, is now only a simple paling: its gate that was such a cumbrous
                     affair—reminding you of Gaza—you might easily lift from its hinges. The lofty
                     dovecote, which seemed to rise like a monument of art, before your boyish
                     vision, is now only a flimsy box upon a tall spar of hemlock.</p>
                  <p>The garret even, with its lofty beams, its dark stains, and its obscure
                     corners, where the white hats, and coats hung ghost-like, is but a low loft,
                     darkened by age,—hung over with cobwebs, dimly lighted with foul windows,—its
                     romping Charlie,—its glee,—its swing,—its joy,—its mystery, all gone
                     forever.</p>
                  <p>The old gallipots, and retorts are not anywhere to be seen in the second story
                     window of the brick school. Dr. Bidlow is no more! The trees that seemed so
                     large, the gymnastic feats that were so extraordinary, the boy that made a
                     snapper of his handkerchief,—have all lost their greatness, and their dread.
                     Even the springy usher, who dressed his hair with the ferule, has become the
                     middle-aged father of five curly-headed boys, and has entered upon what once
                     seemed the gigantic commerce—of 'stationery and account books.'</p>
                  <p>The marvellous labyrinth of closets, at the old mansion where you once paid a
                     visit—in a coach—is<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7259-00000106"/> all dissipated.
                     They have turned out to be the merest cupboards in the wall. Nat, who had
                     travelled, and seen London, is by no means so surprising a fellow to your
                     manhood, as he was to the boy. He has grown spare, and wears spectacles. He is
                     not so famous as he was. You would hardly think of consulting him now about
                     your marriage; or even about the price of goats upon London bridge.</p>
                  <p>As for Jenny—your first, fond flame!—lively, romantic, black-eyed Jenny,—the
                     reader of Thaddeus of Warsaw,—who sighed and wore blue ribbons on her
                     bonnet,—who wrote love notes,—who talked so tenderly of broken hearts,—who used
                     a glass seal with a cupid and a dart,—dear Jenny,—she is now the plump, and
                     thriving wife of the apothecary of the town! She sweeps out every morning at
                     seven, the little entry of the apothecary's house: she buys a 'joint' twice a
                     week from the butcher, and is particular to have the 'knuckle' thrown in, for
                     soups: she wears a sky blue calico gown, and dresses her hair in three little
                     flat quirls on either side of her head—each one pierced through with a
                     two-pronged hair-pin.</p>
                  <p>She does not read Thaddeus of Warsaw, now.</p>

                  <head>II.</head>
                  <head type="sub">MAN OF THE WORLD.</head>
                  <p>FEW persons live through the first periods of manhood, without strong
                     temptations to be counted—'men of the world.' The idea looms grandly among
                     those vanities, that hedge a man's approach to maturity.</p>
                  <p>Clarence is in good training for the acceptance of this idea. The broken hope
                     which clouded his closing youth, shoots over its influence upon the dawn of
                     manhood. Mortified pride had taught—as it always teaches—not caution only, but
                     doubt, distrust, indifference. A new pride grows up on the ruins of the old,
                     weak, and vain pride of youth. Then, it was a pride of learning, or of
                     affection; now, it is a pride of indifference. Then, the world proved bleak,
                     and cold, as<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7259-00000107"/> contrasted with his
                     shining dreams; and now, he accepts the proof, and wins from it what he
                     can.</p>
                  <p>The man of the world puts on the method, and measure of the world: he studies
                     its humors. He gives up the boyish notion of a sincerity among men, like that
                     of youth: he lives, to seem. He conquers such annoyances as the world may
                     thrust upon him, in the shape of grief, or losses, like a practised athlete of
                     the ring. He studies moral sparring.</p>
                  <p>With somewhat of this strange vanity growing on you, you do not suffer the
                     heart to wake into life, except in such fanciful dreams as tempt you back to
                     the sunny slopes of childhood.</p>
                  <p>In this mood, you fall in with Dalton, who has just returned from a year passed
                     in the French Capital. There is an easy suavity, and graceful indifference in
                     his manner that chimes admirably with your humor. He is gracious, without
                     needing to be kind. He is a friend, without any challenge or proffer of
                     sincerity. He is just one of those adepts in world tactics, which match him
                     with all men, but which link him to none. He has made it his art to be desired,
                     and admired, but rarely to be trusted. You could not have a better teacher!</p>
                  <p>Under such instruction, you become disgusted for the time, with any effort, or
                     pulse of affection, which does not have immediate and practical bearing upon
                     that success in life, by which you measure your hopes. The dreams of love, of
                     romantic adventure, of placid joy, have all gone out, with the fantastic
                     images, to which your passionate youth had joined them. The world is now
                     regarded as a tournament, where the gladiator-ship of life is to be exhibited
                     at your best endeavor. Its honors and joy, lie in a brilliant pennant, and a
                     plaudit.</p>
                  <p>Dalton is learned in those arts which make of action—not a duty, but a
                     conquest; and sense of duty has expired in you, with those romantic hopes, to
                     which you bound it,—not as much through sympathy, as ignorance. It is a cold,
                     and a bitterly selfish work that lies before you,—to be covered over with such
                     borrowed show of smiles, as men call affability. The heart wears a stout,
                     brazen screen; its inclinations grow to the habit of your ambitious
                     projects.</p>
                  <p>In such mood come swift dreams of wealth;—not of mere accumulation, but of the
                     splendor, and parade, which in our western world are, alas, its chiefest
                     attractions. You grow observant of markets, and estimate per centages. You
                     fondle some speculation in your thought, until it grows into a gigantic scheme
                     of profit; and if the venture prove successful, you follow the tide
                     tremulously, until some sudden reverse throws you back upon the resources of
                     your professional employ.</p>
                  <p>But again, as you see this and that one wearing the blazonry which wealth wins,
                     and which the man of the<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7259-00000108"/> world is
                     sure to covet,—your weak soul glows again with the impassioned desire; and you
                     hunger, with brute appetite, and bestial eye—for riches. You see the mania
                     around you; and it is relieved of odium, by the community of error. You consult
                     some gray old veteran in the war of gold, scarred with wounds, and crowned with
                     honors; and watch eagerly for the words and the ways, which have won him
                     wealth.</p>
                  <p>Your fingers tingle with mad expectancies; your eyes roam—lost in estimates.
                     Your note-book shows long lines of figures. Your reading of the news centres in
                     the stock list. Your brow grows cramped with the fever of anxiety. Through
                     whole church hours, your dreams range over the shadowy transactions of the week
                     or the month to come.</p>
                  <p>Even with old religious habit clinging fast to your soul, you dream now, only
                     of nice conformity, comfortable faith, high respectability; there lies very
                     little in you of that noble consciousness of Duty performed,—of living up to
                     the Life that is in you,—of grasping boldly, and stoutly, at those chains of
                     Love which the Infinite Power has lowered to our reach. You do not dream of
                     being, but of seeming. You spill the real essence, and clutch at the vial which
                     has only a label of Truth. Great and holy thoughts of the Future,—shadowy, yet
                     bold conceptions of the Infinite, float past you dimly, and your hold is never
                     strong enough to grapple them to you. They fly, like eagles, too near the sun;
                     and there lies game below, for your vulture beak to feed upon.</p>
                  <p>[Great thoughts belong, only and truly, to him whose mind can hold them. No
                     matter who first puts them in words; if they come to a soul, and fill it, they
                     belong to it;—whether they floated on the voice of others, or on the wings of
                     silence, and the night.]</p>
                  <p>To be up with the fashion of the time,—to be ignorant of plain things and
                     people, and to be knowing in brilliancies, is a kind of Pelhamism, that is very
                     apt to overtake one in the first blush of manhood. To hold a fair place in the
                     after-dinner table-talk, to meet distinction as a familiarity, to wear salon
                     honors with aplomb, to know affection so far as to wield it into grace of
                     language, are all splendid achievements with a man of the world. Instruction is
                     caught, without asking it; and no ignorance so shames, as ignorance of those
                     forms, by which natural impulse is subdued to the tone of civilian habit. You
                     conceal what tells of the man; and cover it with what smacks of the roué.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps, under such training, and with a slight memory of early mortification
                     to point your spirit, you affect those gallantries of heart and action, which
                     the world calls flirtation. You may study brilliancies of speech, to wrap their
                     net around those susceptible hearts, whose habit is too naïve by nature, to
                     wear the<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7259-00000109"/> leaden covering of custom.
                     You win approaches by artful counterfeit of earnestness; and dash away any
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">naïveté</foreign> of confidence, with some brave
                     sophism of the world. A doubt or a distrust, piques your pride, and makes
                     attentions wear a humility that wins anew. An indifference piques you more, and
                     throws into your art a counter indifference,—lit up by bold flashes of
                     feeling,—sparkling with careless brilliancies, and crowned with a triumph of
                     neglect.</p>
                  <p>It is curious how ingeniously a man's vanity will frame apologies for such
                     action.——It is pleasant to give pleasure; you like to see a joyous sparkle of
                     the eye, whether lit up by your presence, or by some buoyant fancy. It is a
                     beguiling task to weave words into some soft, melodious flow, that shall keep
                     the car, and kindle the eye;—and to strew it over with half-hidden praises, so
                     deftly couched in double terms, that their aroma shall only come to the heart
                     hours afterward; and seem to be the merest accidents of truth. It is a happy
                     art to make such subdued show of emotion, as seems to struggle with pride; and
                     to flush the eye with a moisture, of which you seem ashamed, and yet are proud.
                     It is a pretty practice, to throw an earnestness into look and gesture, that
                     shall seem full of pleading, and yet—ask nothing!</p>
                  <p>And yet it is hard to admire greatly the reputation of that man, who builds his
                     triumphs upon womanly weakness: that distinction is not over enduring, whose
                     chiefest merit springs out of the delusions of a too trustful heart. The man
                     who wins it, wins only a poor sort of womanly distinction. Without power to
                     cope with men, he triumphs over the weakness of the other sex, only by
                     hypocrisy. He wears none of the armor of Romans; and he parleys with Punic
                     faith.</p>
                  <p>——Yet, even now,—there is a lurking goodness in you, that traces its beginnings
                     to the old garret home;—there is an air in the harvest heats, that whispers of
                     the bloom of spring.</p>
                  <p>And over your brilliant career as man of the world,—however lit up by a morbid
                     vanity, or galvanized by a lascivious passion, there will come at times, the
                     consciousness of a better heart struggling beneath your cankered action,—like
                     the low Vesuvian fire, reeking vainly under rough beds of tufa, and scoriated
                     lava. And as you smile in loge, or salon, with daring smiles; or press with
                     villain fondness, the hand of those lady votaries of the same god you serve,
                     there will gleam upon you, over the waste of rolling years, a memory that
                     quickens again the nobler, and bolder instincts of the heart.</p>
                  <p>Childish recollections, with their purity, and earnestness,—a sister's love,—a
                     mother's solicitude, will flood your soul once more with a gushing sensibility
                     that yearns for enjoyment. And the consciousness of some<pb n="218-219"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000110"/> lingering nobility of affection, that can only
                     grow great, in mating itself with nobility of heart, will sweep off your puny
                     triumphs, your Platonic friendships, your dashing coquetries,—like the foul
                     smoke of a city, before a fresh breeze of the country autumn.</p>

                  <head type="sub">MANLY HOPE.</head>
                  <p>YOU are at home again;—not your own home, that is gone; but at the home of
                     Nelly, and of Frank. The city heats of summer drive you to the country. You
                     ramble, with a little kindling of old desires and memories, over the hill sides
                     that once bounded your boyish vision. Here, you netted the wild rabbits, as
                     they came out at dusk, to feed; there, upon that tall chesnut, you cruelly
                     maimed your first captive squirrel. The old maples are even now scarred with
                     the rude cuts you gave them, in sappy March.</p>
                  <p>You sit down upon some height, overlooking the valley where you were born; you
                     trace the faint, silvery line of river; you detect by the leaning elm, your old
                     bathing place upon the Saturdays of Summer.<pb n="220-221"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000111"/> Your eye dwells upon some patches of pasture
                     wood, which were famous for their nuts. Your rambling, and saddened vision
                     roams over the houses; it traces the familiar chimney stacks; it searches out
                     the low-lying cottages; it dwells upon the gray roof, sleeping yonder under the
                     sycamores.</p>
                  <p>Tears swell in your eye, as you gaze; you cannot tell whence, or why they come.
                     Yet they are tears eloquent of feeling. They speak of brother children—of
                     boyish glee,—of the flush of young health,—of a mother's devotion,—of the home
                     affections,—of the vanities of life,—of the wasting years, of the Death that
                     must shroud what friends remain, as it has shrouded what friends have gone,—and
                     of that GREAT HOPE, beaming on your sered manhood dimly, from the upper
                     world!</p>
                  <p>Your wealth suffices for all the luxuries of life: there is no fear of coming
                     want; health beats strong in your veins; you have learned to hold a place in
                     the world, with a man's strength, and a man's confidence. And yet in the view
                     of those sweet scenes which belonged to early days, when neither strength,
                     confidence, nor wealth were yours, days never to come again,—a shade of
                     melancholy broods upon your spirit, and covers with its veil all that fierce
                     pride which your worldly wisdom has wrought.</p>
                  <p>You visit again, with Frank, the country homestead of his grandfather; he is
                     dead; but the old lady still lives; and blind Fanny, now drawing toward
                     womanhood, wears yet through her darkened life, the same air of placid content,
                     and of sweet trustfulness in Heaven. The boys whom you astounded with your
                     stories of books are gone, building up now with steady industry the queen
                     cities of our new Western land. The old clergyman is gone from the desk, and
                     from under his sounding board; he sleeps beneath a brown stone slab in the
                     church yard. The stout deacon is dead; his wig and his wickedness rest
                     together. The tall chorister sings yet: but they have now a bass-viol—handled
                     by a new schoolmaster, in place of his tuning fork; and the years have sown
                     feeble quavers in his voice.</p>
                  <p>Once more you meet at the home of Nelly,—the blue eyed Madge. The sixpence is
                     all forgotten; you cannot tell where your half of it is gone. Yet she is
                     beautiful—just budding into the full ripeness of womanhood. Her eyes have a
                     quiet, still joy, and hope beaming in them, like angel's looks. Her motions
                     have a native grace, and freedom, that no culture can bestow. Her words have a
                     gentle earnestness and honesty, that could never nurture guile.</p>
                  <p>You had thought, after your gay experiences of the world, to meet her with a
                     kind condescension, as an old friend of Nelly's. But there is that in her
                        eye,<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7259-00000112"/> which forbids all thought of
                     condescension. There is that in her air, which tells of a high womanly dignity,
                     which can only be met on equal ground. Your pride is piqued. She has known—she
                     must know your history; but it does not tame her. There is no marked and
                     submissive appreciation of your gifts, as a man of the world.</p>
                  <p>She meets your happiest compliments with a very easy indifference; she receives
                     your elegant civilities with a very assured brow. She neither courts your
                     society, nor avoids it. She does not seek to provoke any special attention. And
                     only when your old-self glows in some casual kindness to Nelly, does her look
                     beam with a flush of sympathy.</p>
                  <p>This look touches you. It makes you ponder on the noble heart that lives in
                     Madge. It makes you wish it were yours. But that is gone. The fervor and the
                     honesty of a glowing youth, is swallowed up in the flash and splendor of the
                     world. A half-regret chases over you at night-fall, when solitude pierces you
                     with the swift dart of gone-by memories. But at morning, the regret dies, in
                     the glitter of ambitious purposes.</p>
                  <p>The summer months linger; and still you linger with them. Madge is often with
                     Nelly; and Madge is never less than Madge. You venture to point your attentions
                     with a little more fervor; but she meets the fervor with no glow. She knows too
                     well the habit of your life.</p>
                  <p>Strange feelings come over you;—feelings like half-forgotten
                     memories—musical—dreamy—doubtful. You have seen a hundred faces more brilliant
                     than that of Madge; you have pressed a hundred jewelled hands that have
                     returned a half-pressure to yours. You do not exactly admire;—to love, you have
                     forgotten;—you only—linger!</p>
                  <p>It is a soft autumn evening, and the harvest moon is red and round over the
                     eastern skirt of woods. You are attending Madge to that little cottage home,
                     where lives that gentle and doting mother, who in the midst of comparative
                     poverty, cherishes that refined delicacy, which never comes to a child, but by
                     inheritance.</p>
                  <p>Madge has been passing the day with Nelly. Something—it may be the soft autumn
                     air wafting toward you the freshness of young days,—moves you to speak, as you
                     have not ventured to speak,—as your vanity has not allowed you to speak
                     before.</p>
                  <p>"You remember, Madge, (you have guarded this sole token of boyish intimacy) our
                     split sixpence?"</p>
                  <p>"Perfectly:" it is a short word to speak, and there is no tremor in her
                     tone—not the slightest.</p>
                  <p>"You have it yet?"</p>
                  <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7259-00000113"/>
                  <p>"I dare say, I have it somewhere:" no tremor now: she is very composed.</p>
                  <p>"That was a happy time:" very great emphasis on the word happy.</p>
                  <p>"Very happy:"—no emphasis anywhere.</p>
                  <p>"I sometimes wish I might live it over again."</p>
                  <p>"Yes?"—inquiringly.</p>
                  <p>"There are after all no pleasures in the world like those."</p>
                  <p>"No?"—inquiringly again.</p>
                  <p>You thought you had learned to have language at command: you never thought,
                     after so many years schooling of the world, that your pliant tongue would play
                     you truant. Yet now,—you are silent.</p>
                  <p>The moon steals silvery into the light flakes of cloud, and the air is soft as
                     May. The cottage is in sight. Again you risk utterance:—</p>
                  <p>"You must live very happily here."</p>
                  <p>"I have very kind friends:"—the very, is emphasized.</p>
                  <p>"I am sure Nelly loves you very much."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I believe it!"—with great earnestness.</p>
                  <p>You are at the cottage door:—</p>
                  <p>"Good night, Maggie,"—very feelingly.</p>
                  <p>"Good night, Clarence,"—very kindly; and she draws her hand coyly, and half
                     tremulously, from your somewhat fevered grasp.</p>
                  <p>You stroll away dreamily,—watching the moon,— running over your fragmentary
                     life;—half moody,—half pleased,—half hopeful.</p>
                  <p>You come back stealthily, and with a heart throbbing with a certain wild sense
                     of shame, to watch the light gleaming in the cottage. You linger in the shadows
                     of the trees, until you catch a glimpse of her figure, gliding past the window.
                     You bear the image home with you. You are silent on your return. You retire
                     early;—but you do not sleep early.</p>
                  <p>——If you were only as you were:—if it were not too late! If Madge could only
                     love you, as you know she will, and must love one manly heart, there would be a
                     world of joy opening before you. But it is too late!</p>
                  <p>You draw out Nelly to speak of Madge: Nelly is very prudent. "Madge is a dear
                     girl,"—she says. Does Nelly even distrust you? It is a sad thing to be too much
                     a man of the world!</p>
                  <p>You go back again to noisy, ambitious life: you try to drown old memories in
                     its blaze, and its vanities. Your lot seems cast, beyond all change; and you
                     task yourself with its noisy fulfilment. But amid the silence, and the toil of
                     your office hours, a strange desire broods over your spirit;—a desire for more
                     of manliness,—that manliness which feels itself a protector of loving, and
                     trustful innocence.</p>
                  <p>You look around upon the faces in which you have smiled unmeaning smiles:—there
                     is nothing there to<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7259-00000114"/> feed your
                     dawning desires. You meet with those ready to court you by flattering your
                     vanity—by retailing the praises of what you may do well,—by odious
                     familiarity,—by brazen proffer of friendship; but you see in it only the
                     emptiness, and the vanity, which you have studied to enjoy.</p>
                  <p>Sickness comes over you, and binds you for weary days and nights;—in which life
                     hovers doubtfully, and the lips babble secrets that you cherish. It is
                     astonishing how disease clips a man from the artificialities of the world!
                     Lying lonely upon his bed, moaning, writhing, suffering, his soul joins on to
                     the universe of souls by only natural bonds. The factitious ties of wealth, of
                     place, of reputation, vanish from his bleared eyes; and the earnest heart, deep
                     under all, craves only—heartiness!</p>
                  <p>The old craving of the office silence comes back:—not with the proud wish
                     only—of being a protector, but—of being protected. And whatever may be the
                     trust in that beneficent Power, who 'chasteneth whom he loveth,'—there is yet
                     an earnest, human yearning toward some one, whose love—most, and whose
                     duty—least, would call her to your side;—whose soft hands would cool the fever
                     of yours,—whose step would wake a throb of joy,—whose voice would tie you to
                     life, and whose presence would make the worst of Death—an Adieu!</p>
                  <p>As you gain strength once more, you go back to Nelly's home. Her kindness does
                     not falter; every care and attention belong to you there. Again your eye rests
                     upon that figure of Madge, and upon her face, wearing an even gentler
                     expression, as she sees you sitting pale and feeble by the old hearth-stone.
                     She brings flowers—for Nelly: you beg Nelly to place them upon the little table
                     at your side. It is as yet the only taste of the country that you can enjoy.
                     You love those flowers.</p>
                  <p>After a time you grow strong, and walk in the fields. You linger until
                     nightfall. You pass by the cottage where Madge lives. It is your pleasantest
                     walk. The trees are greenest in that direction; the shadows are softest; the
                     flowers are thickest.</p>
                  <p>It is strange—this feeling in you. It is not the feeling you had for Laura
                     Dalton. It does not even remind of that. That was an impulse; but this is
                     growth. That was strong; but this is—strength. You catch sight of her little
                     notes to Nelly; you read them over and over; you treasure them; you learn them
                     by heart. There is something in the very writing, that touches you.</p>
                  <p>You bid her adieu with tones of kindness that tremble;—and that meet a
                     half-trembling tone in reply. She is very good.</p>
                  <p>——If it were not too late!</p>

                  <head type="sub">MANLY LOVE.</head>
                  <p>AND shall pride yield at length!</p>
                  <p>——Pride!——and what has love to do with pride? Let us see how it is.</p>
                  <p>Madge is poor; she is humble. You are rich; you are a man of the world; you are
                     met respectfully by the veterans of fashion; you have gained perhaps a kind of
                     brilliancy of position.</p>
                  <p>Would it then be a condescension to love Madge? Dare you ask yourself such a
                     question? Do you not know,—in spite of your worldliness,—that the man or the
                     woman who <emph>condescends</emph> to love, never loves in earnest?</p>
                  <p>But again, Madge is possessed of a purity, a delicacy, and a dignity that lift
                     her far above you,—that make you feel your weakness, and your unworthiness; and
                     it is the deep, and the mortifying sense of this unworthiness, that makes you
                     bolster yourself upon your pride. You <emph>know</emph> that you do yourself
                     honor, in loving such grace and goodness;—you know that you would be honored
                     tenfold more than you deserve, in being loved—by so much grace, and
                     goodness.</p>
                  <p>It scarce seems to you possible; it is a joy too great to be hoped for: and in
                     the doubt of its attainment, your old, worldly-vanity comes in, and tells you
                     to—beware; and to live on, in the splendor of your dissipation, and in the
                     lusts of your selfish habit. Yet still, underneath all, there is a deep, low,
                     heart-voice,—quickened from above,—which assures you that you are capable of
                     better things;—that you are not wholly lost; that a mine of unstarted
                     tenderness still lies smouldering in your soul.</p>
                  <p>And with this sense quickening your better nature, you venture the wealth of
                     your whole heart-life, upon the hope that now blazes on your path.</p>
                  <p>——You are seated at your desk, working with such zeal of labor, as your
                     ambitious projects never could command. It is a letter to Margaret Boyne, that
                     so tasks your love, and makes the veins upon your forehead swell with the
                     earnestness of the employ.</p>

                              <p>——"DEAR MADGE,—May I not call you thus, if<pb n="230-231"
                                    xml:id="VAC7259-00000116"/> only in memory of our childish
                                 affections;—and might I dare to hope that a riper affection which
                                 your character has awakened, may permit me to call you thus,
                                 always?</p>
                              <p>"If I have not ventured to speak, dear Madge, will you not believe
                                 that the consciousness of my own ill-desert has tied my
                                 tongue;—will you not, at least, give me credit for a little
                                 remaining modesty of heart? You know my life, and you know my
                                 character—what a sad jumble of errors, and of misfortunes have
                                 belonged to each. You know the careless, and the vain purposes
                                 which have made me recreant to the better nature, which belonged to
                                 that sunny childhood, when we lived, and grew up—together. And will
                                 you not believe me when I say, that your grace of character, and
                                 kindness of heart, have drawn me back from the follies in which I
                                 lived; and quickened new desires, which I thought to be wholly
                                 dead? Can I indeed hope that you will overlook all that has gained
                                 your secret reproaches; and confide in a heart, which is made
                                 conscious of better things, by the love—you have inspired?</p>
                              <p>"Ah, Madge, it is not with a vain show of words, or with any
                                 counterfeit of feeling, that I write now;—you know it is not;—you
                                 know that my heart is leaning toward you, with the freshness of its
                                 noblest instincts;—you know that—I love you!</p>
                              <p>"Can I, dare I hope, that it is not spoken in vain? I had thought
                                 in my pride, never to make such avowal,—never again to sue for
                                 affection; but your gentleness, your modesty, your virtues of life
                                 and heart, have conquered me! I am sure you will treat me with the
                                 generosity of a victor.</p>
                              <p>"You know my weaknesses;—I would not conceal from you a single
                                 one,—even to win you. I can offer nothing to you, which will bear
                                 comparison in value, with what is yours to bestow. I can only offer
                                 this feeble hand of mine—to guard you; and this poor heart—to love
                                 you!</p>
                              <p>"Am I rash? Am I extravagant, in word, or in hope? Forgive it then,
                                 dear Madge, for the sake of our old childish affection; and believe
                                 me, when I say, that what is here written,—is written honestly, and

                     within the ramparts of Duty and of Devotion. It is a citadel of strength, in
                     the middle of the city of her affections. To win the way to it, there must be

                  <p>You are again at the home of Nelly; she is very joyous; she is the confident of
                     Madge. Nelly feels, that with all your errors, you have enough inner goodness
                     of heart to make Madge happy; and she feels—doubly—that Madge has such excess
                     of goodness as will cover your heart with joy. Yet she tells you very little.
                     She will give you no full assurance of the love of Madge; she leaves that for
                     yourself to win.</p>
                  <p>She will even tease you in her pleasant way, until hope almost changes to
                     despair; and your brow grows pale with the dread—that even now, your
                     unworthiness may condemn you.</p>
                  <p>It is summer weather; and you have been walking over the hills of home with
                     Madge, and Nelly. Nelly has found some excuse to leave you,—glancing at you
                     most teazingly, as she hurries away.</p>
                  <p>You are left sitting with Madge, upon a bank tufted with blue violets. You have
                     been talking of the days of childhood, and some word has called up the old
                     chain of boyish feeling, and joined it to your new hope.</p>
                  <p>What you would say, crowds too fast for utterance; and you abandon it. But you
                     take from your pocket that little, broken bit of sixpence,—which you have found
                     after long search,—and without a word, but with a look that tells your inmost
                     thought, you lay it in the half-opened hand of Madge.</p>
                  <p>She looks at you, with a slight suffusion of color,—seems to hesitate a
                     moment,—raises her other hand, and draws from her bosom, by a bit of blue
                     ribbon, a little locket. She touches a spring, and there falls beside your
                     relique,—another, that had once belonged to it.</p>
                  <p>Hope glows now like the sun.</p>
                  <p>——"And you have worn this, Maggie?"</p>
                  <p>——"Always!"</p>
                  <p>"Dear Madge!"</p>
                  <p>"Dear Clarence!"</p>
                  <p>——And you pass your arm now, unchecked, around that yielding, graceful figure;
                     and fold her to your bosom, with the swift, and blessed assurance, that your
                     fullest, and noblest dream of love, is won!</p>

                  <head type="sub">CHEER AND CHILDREN.</head>
                  <p>WHAT a glow there is to the sun! What warmth—yet it does not oppress you: what
                     coolness—yet it is not too cool. The birds sing sweetly; you catch yourself
                     watching to see what new songsters they can be:—they are only the old robins
                     and thrushes;—yet what a new melody is in their throats!</p>
                  <p>The clouds hang gorgeous shapes upon the sky,—shapes they could hardly ever
                     have fashioned before. The grass was never so green, the butter-cups were never
                     so plenty; there was never such a life in the leaves. It seems as if the
                     joyousness in you, gave a throb to nature, that made every green thing
                     buoyant.</p>
                  <p>Faces too are changed: men look pleasantly: children dren are all charming
                     children: even babies look tender and lovable. The street beggar at your door
                     is suddenly grown into a Belisarius, and is one of the most deserving heroes of
                     modern times. Your mind is in a continued ferment; you glide through your
                     toil—dashing out sparkles of passion—like a ship in the sea. No difficulty
                     daunts you: there is a kind of buoyancy in your soul, that rocks over danger or
                     doubt, as sea-waves heave calmly and smoothly, over sunken rocks.</p>
                  <p>You grow unusually amiable and kind; you are earnest in your search of friends;
                     you shake hands with your office boy, as if he were your second cousin. You
                     joke cheerfully with the stout washerwoman; and give her a shilling
                     over-change, and insist upon her keeping it; and grow quite merry at the
                     recollection of it. You tap your hackman on the shoulder very familiarly, and
                     tell him he is a capital fellow; and don't allow him to whip his horses, except
                     when driving to the post-office. You even ask him to take a glass of beer with
                     you, upon some chilly evening. You drink to the health of his wife.—He says he
                     has no wife:—whereupon you think him a very miserable man; and give him a
                     dollar, by way of consolation.</p>
                  <p>You think all the editorials in the morning papers are remarkably
                     well-written,—whether upon your side, or upon the other. You think the
                     stock-market has a<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7259-00000119"/> very cheerful
                     look,—even with Erie—of which you are a large holder—down to seventy-five. You
                     wonder why you never admired Mrs. Hemans before, or Stoddard, or any of the
                     rest.</p>
                  <p>You give a pleasant twirl to your fingers, as you saunter along the street; and
                     say—but not so loud as to be overheard—"She is mine—she is mine!"</p>
                  <p>You wonder if Frank ever loved Nelly, one half as well as you love Madge?—You
                     feel quite sure he never did. You can hardly conceive how it is, that Madge has
                     not been seized before now, by scores of enamored men, and borne off, like the
                     Sabine women in Romish history. You chuckle over your future, like a boy who
                     has found a guinea, in groping for sixpences. You read over the marriage
                     service,—thinking of the time when you will take <emph>her</emph> hand, and
                     slip the ring upon <emph>her</emph> finger; and repeat after the clergyman—'for
                     richer—for poorer; for better—for worse'! A great deal of 'worse' there will be
                     about it, you think!</p>
                  <p>Through all, your heart cleaves to that sweet image of the beloved Madge, as
                     light cleaves to day. The weeks leap with a bound; and the months only grow
                     long, when you approach that day which is to make her yours. There are no
                     flowers rare enough to make bouquets for her; diamonds are too dim for her to
                     wear; pearls are tame.</p>
                  <p>——And after marriage, the weeks are even shorter than before: you wonder why on
                     earth all the single men in the world, do not rush tumultuously to the Altar;
                     you look upon them all, as a travelled man will look upon some conceited Dutch
                     boor, who has never been beyond the limits of his cabbage-garden. Married men,
                     on the contrary, you regard as fellow-voyagers; and look upon their wives—ugly
                     as they may be—as, better than none.</p>
                  <p>You blush a little, at first telling your butcher what 'your wife' would like;
                     you bargain with the grocer for sugars and teas, and wonder if he
                        <emph>knows</emph> that you are a married man? You practise your new way of
                     talk upon your office boy;—you tell him that 'your wife' expects you home to
                     dinner; and are astonished that he does not stare to hear you say it!</p>
                  <p>You wonder if the people in the omnibus know, that Madge and you are just
                     married; and if the driver knows, that the shilling you hand to him, is for
                     'self and wife?' You wonder if any body was ever so happy before, or ever will
                     be so happy again?</p>
                  <p>You enter your name upon the hotel books as 'Clarence —— and Lady'; and come
                     back to look at it,—wondering if any body else has noticed it,—and thinking
                     that it looks remarkably well. You cannot help thinking that every third man
                     you meet in the hall, wishes he possessed your wife;—nor do you think it very
                     sinful in him, to wish it. You fear it is placing<pb n="238-239"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000120"/> temptation in the way of covetous men, to put
                     Madge's little gaiters outside the chamber door, at night.</p>
                  <p>Your home, when it is entered, is just what it should be:—quiet, small,—with
                     everything she wishes, and nothing more than she wishes. The sun strikes it in
                     the happiest possible way:—the piano is the sweetest-toned in the world:—the
                     library is stocked to a charm;—and Madge, that blessed wife, is
                     there,—adorning, and giving life to it all. To think, even, of her possible
                     death, is a suffering you class with the infernal tortures of the Inquisition.
                     You grow twain of heart, and of purpose. Smiles seem made for marriage; and you
                     wonder how you ever wore them before!</p>
                  <p>So, a year and more wears off, of mingled home-life, visiting, and travel. A
                     new hope and joy lightens home:—there is a child there.</p>
                  <p>——What a joy to be a father! What new emotions crowd the eye with tears, and
                     make the hand tremble! What a benevolence radiates from you toward the
                     nurse,—toward the physician—toward everybody! What a holiness, and sanctity of
                     love grows upon your old devotion to that wife of your bosom,—the mother of
                     your child!</p>
                  <p>The excess of joy seems almost to blur the stories of happiness which attach to
                     heaven: You are now joined, as you were never joined before, to the great
                     family of man. Your name and blood will live after you; nor do you once think
                     (what father can?) but that it will live honorably and well.</p>
                  <p>With what a new air you walk the streets! With what a triumph, you speak in
                     your letter to Nelly,—of 'your family!' Who, that has not felt it, knows what
                     it is—to be 'a man of family!'</p>
                  <p>How weak now, seem all the imaginations of your single life: what bare, dry
                     skeletons of the reality, they furnished! You pity the poor fellows who have no
                     wives or children,—from your soul: you count their smiles, as empty smiles, put
                     on to cover the lack that is in them. There is a free-masonry among fathers,
                     that they know nothing of. You compassionate them deeply: you think them worthy
                     objects of some charitable association: you would cheerfully buy tracts for
                     them, if they would but read them,—tracts on marriage and children.</p>
                  <p>——And then 'the boy'——<emph>such</emph> a boy!</p>
                  <p>There was a time, when you thought all babies very much alike:——alike? Is your
                     boy like anything, except the wonderful fellow that he is? Was there ever a
                     baby seen, or even read of, like that baby!</p>
                  <p>——Look at him:—pick him up in his long, white gown: he may have an excess of
                     colour,—but such a pretty colour! he is a little pouty about the mouth—<pb
                        n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7259-00000121"/> but such a mouth! His hair
                        <emph>is</emph> a little scant, and he is rather wandering in the eye;—but,
                     Good Heavens,—what an eye!</p>
                  <p>There was a time, when you thought it very absurd for fathers to talk about
                     their children; but it does not seem at all absurd now. You think, on the
                     contrary, that your old friends, who used to sup with you at the club, would be
                     delighted to know how your baby is getting on, and how much be measures around
                     the calf of the leg! If they pay you a visit, you are quite sure they are in an
                     agony to see Frank; and you hold the little squirming fellow in your arms, half
                     conscience-smitten, for provoking them to such envy, as they must be suffering.
                     You make a settlement upon the boy with a chuckle,—as if you were treating
                     yourself to a mint-julep,—instead of conveying away a few thousands of seven
                     per cents.</p>
                  <p>——Then the boy developes, astonishingly. What a head—what a foot,—what a voice!
                     And he is so quiet withal;—never known to cry, except under such provocation as
                     would draw tears from a heart of adamant; in short, for the first six months,
                     he is never anything, but gentle, patient, earnest, loving, intellectual, and
                     magnanimous. You are half afraid that some of the physicians will be reporting
                     the case, as one of the most remarkable instances of perfect moral and physical
                     development, on record.</p>
                  <p>But the years roll on, in the which your extravagant fancies, die into the
                     earnest maturity of a father's love. You struggle gaily with the cares that
                     life brings to your door. You feel the strength of three beings in your single
                     arm; and feel your heart warming toward God and man, with the added warmth of
                     two other loving, and trustful beings.</p>
                  <p>How eagerly you watch the first tottering step of that boy: how you riot in the
                     joy and pride, that swell in that mother's eyes, as they follow his feeble,
                     staggering motions! Can God bless his creatures, more than he has blessed that
                     dear Madge, and you? Has Heaven even richer joys, than live in that home of
                     yours?</p>
                  <p>By and by, he speaks; and minds tie together by language, as the hearts have
                     long tied by looks. He wanders with you, feebly, and with slow, wondering
                     paces, upon the verge of the great universe of thought. His little eye sparkles
                     with some vague fancy that comes upon him first, by language. Madge teaches him
                     the words of affection, and of thankfulness; and she teaches him to lisp infant
                     prayer; and by secret pains, (how could she be so secret?) instructs him in
                     some little phrase of endearment, that she knows will touch your heart; and
                     then, she watches your coming; and the little fellow runs toward you, and<pb
                        n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7259-00000122"/> warbles out his lesson of love, in
                     tones that forbid you any answer,—save only those brimming eyes,—turned first
                     on her, and then on him;—and poorly concealed, by the quick embrace, and the
                     kisses which you shower in transport!</p>
                  <p>Still slip on the years, like brimming bowls of nectar! Another Madge is sister
                     to Frank; and a little Nelly, is younger sister to this other Madge.</p>
                  <p>——Three of them!—a charmed, and mystic number;—which if it be broken in these
                     young days,—as, alas, it may be!—will only yield a cherub angel, to float over
                     you, and to float over them—to wean you, and to wean them, from this world,
                     where all joys do perish, to that seraph world, where joys do last forever!</p>

                  <p>IS our life a sun, that it should radiate light and heat forever? Do not the
                     calmest, and brightest days of autumn, show clouds that drift their ragged
                     edges over the golden disc; and bear down swift, with their weight of vapors,
                     until the whole sun's surface is shrouded;—and you can see no shadow of tree,
                     or flower upon the land, because of the greater, and gulphing shadow of the
                     cloud?</p>
                  <p>Will not life bear me out;—will not truth, earnest and stern, around me, make
                     good the terrible imagination that now comes swooping heavily, and darkly, upon
                     my brain?</p>
                  <p>You are living in a little village, not far away from the city. It is a
                     graceful, and luxurious home that you<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7259-00000123"
                     /> possess. The holly and the laurel gladden its lawn in winter; and bowers of
                     blossoms sweeten it through all the summer. You know, each day of your return
                     from the town, where first you will catch sight of that graceful figure,
                     flitting like a shadow of love, beneath the trees: you know well, where you
                     will meet the joyous, and noisy welcome of stout Frank, and of tottling Nelly.
                     Day after day, and week after week, they fail not.</p>
                  <p>A friend sometimes attends you; and a friend to you, is always a friend to
                     Madge. In the city, you fall in once more with your old acquaintance
                     Dalton;—the graceful, winning, yet dissolute man that his youth promised. He
                     wishes to see your cottage home. Your heart half hesitates: yet it seems folly
                     to cherish distrust of a boon companion, in so many of your revels.</p>
                  <p>Madge receives him with that sweet smile, which welcomes all your friends. He
                     gains the heart of Frank, by talking of his toys, and of his pigeons; and he
                     wins upon the tenderness of the mother, by his attentions to the child. Even
                     you, repent of your passing shadow of dislike, and feel your heart warming
                     toward him, as he takes little Nelly in his arms, and provokes her joyous
                     prattle.</p>
                  <p>Madge is unbounded in her admiration of your friend: he renews, at your
                     solicitation, his visit: he proves kinder than ever; and you grow ashamed of
                     your distrust.</p>
                  <p>Madge is not learned in the arts of a city life: the accomplishments of a man
                     of the world are almost new to her: she listens with eagerness to Dalton's
                     graphic stories of foreign fêtes, and luxury: she is charmed with his clear,
                     bold voice, and with his manly execution of little operatic airs.</p>
                  <p>——She is beautiful—that wife who has made your heart whole, by its
                     division—fearfully beautiful! And she is not cold, or impassive: her heart
                     though fond, and earnest, is yet human:—we are all human. The accomplishments
                     and graces of the world must needs take hold upon her fancy. And a fear creeps
                     over you, that you dare not whisper,—that those graces may cast into the shade,
                     your own yearning, and silent tenderness.</p>
                  <p>But this is a selfish fear, that you think you have no right to cherish. She
                     takes pleasure in the society of Dalton,—what right have you, to say her—nay?
                     His character indeed is not altogether such as you could wish; but will it not
                     be selfish to tell her even this? Will it not be even worse, and show taint of
                     a lurking suspicion, which you know would wound her grievously? You struggle
                     with your distrust, by meeting him more kindly than ever: yet, at times, there
                     will steal over you a sadness,—which that dear Madge detects, and<pb
                        n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7259-00000124"/> sorrowing in her turn, tries to draw
                     away from you by the touching kindness of sympathy. Her look, and manner kill
                     all your doubt; and you show that it is gone, and piously conceal the cause, by
                     welcoming in gayer tones than ever, the man who has fostered it, by his
                     presence.</p>
                  <p>Business calls you away to a great distance from home: it is the first long
                     parting of your real man-hood. And can suspicion, or a fear, lurk amid those
                     tearful embraces?—Not one,——thank God,—not one!</p>
                  <p>Your letters, frequent and earnest, bespeak your increased devotion; and the
                     embraces you bid her give to the sweet ones of your little flock, tell of the
                     calmness, and sufficiency of your love. Her letters too, are running over with
                     affection:—what though she mentions the frequent visits of Dalton, and tells
                     stories of his kindness and attachment? You feel safe in her strength: and
                     yet—yet there is a brooding terror that rises out of your knowledge of Dalton's
                     character.</p>
                  <p>And can you tell her this; can you stab her fondness, now that you are away,
                     with even a hint of what would crush her delicate nature?</p>
                  <p>What you know to be love, and what you fancy to be duty, struggle long: but
                     love conquers. And with sweet trust in her, and double trust in God, you await
                     your return. That return will be speedier than you think.</p>
                  <p>You receive one day a letter: it is addressed in the hand of a friend, who is
                     often at the cottage, but who has rarely written to you. What can have tempted
                     him now? Has any harm come near your home? No wonder your hands tremble at the
                     opening of that sheet;——no wonder that your eyes run like lightning over the
                     hurried lines. Yet there is little in them—very little. The hand is stout and
                     fair. It is a calm letter,—a friendly letter; but it is short—terribly short.
                     It bids you come home—'<emph>at once!</emph>'</p>
                  <p>——And you go. It is a pleasant country you have to travel through; but you see
                     very little of the country. It is a dangerous voyage perhaps, you have to make;
                     but you think very little of the danger. The creaking of the timbers, and the
                     lashing of the waves, are quieting music, compared with the storm of your
                     raging fears. All the while, you associate Dalton with the terror that seems to
                     hang over you; and yet,—your trust in Madge, is true as Heaven!</p>
                  <p>At length you approach that home;—there lies your cottage lying sweetly upon
                     its hill-side; and the autumn winds are soft; and the maple-tops sway
                     gracefully, all clothed in the scarlet of their frost-dress. Once again, as the
                     sun sinks behind the mountain with a trail of glory, and the violet haze tints
                     the grey clouds, like so many robes of angels,—you take heart and courage; and
                     with firm reliance on the Providence<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7259-00000125"/>
                     that fashions all forms of beauty, whether in Heaven or in heart,—your fears
                     spread out, and vanish with the waning twilight.</p>
                  <p>She is not at the cottage door to meet you; she does not expect you; and yet
                     your bosom heaves, and your breathing is quick. Your friend meets you, and
                     shakes your hand.——"Clarence," he says, with the tenderness of an old
                     friend,—"be a man!"</p>
                  <p>Alas, you are a man;—with a man's heart, and a man's fear, and a man's agony!
                     Little Frank comes bounding toward you joyously—yet under traces of tears:—"Oh,
                     Papa, Mother is gone!"</p>
                  <p>——"Gone!"——And you turn to the face of your friend;—it is well he is near by,
                     or you would have fallen.</p>
                  <p>He can tell you very little; he has known the character of Dalton; he has seen
                     with fear his assiduous attentions—tenfold multiplied since your leave. He has
                     trembled for the issue: this very morning he observed a travelling carriage at
                     the door;—they drove away together. You have no strength to question him. You
                     see that he fears the worst:—he does not know Madge, so well as you.</p>
                  <p>——And can it be? Are you indeed widowed with that most terrible of
                     widowhoods?—Is your wife living,—and yet—lost! Talk not to such a man of the
                     woes of sickness, of poverty, of death;—he will laugh at your mimicry of
                     grief.</p>
                  <p>——All is blackness; whichever way you turn, it is the same; there is no light;
                     your eye is put out; your soul is desolate forever! The heart, by which you had
                     grown up into the full stature of joy, and blessing, is rooted out of you, and
                     thrown like something loathsome, at which the carrion dogs of the world scent,
                     and snuffle!</p>
                  <p>They will point at you, as the man who has lost all that he prized; and she has
                     stolen it, whom he prized; more than what was stolen! And he, the accursed
                     miscreant——But no, it can never be! Madge is as true as Heaven!</p>
                  <p>Yet she is not there: whence comes the light that is to cheer you?</p>
                  <p>——Your children?</p>
                  <p>Aye, your children,—your little Nelly,—your noble Frank,—they are
                     yours;—doubly, trebly, tenfold yours, now that she, their mother, is a mother
                     no more to them, forever!</p>
                  <p>Aye, close your doors; shut out the world;—draw close your curtains;—fold them
                     to your heart,—your crushed, bleeding, desolate heart! Lay your forehead to the
                     soft cheek of your noble boy;—beware, beware how you dampen that damask cheek
                     with your scalding tears:—yet you cannot help it;—they fall—great<pb
                        n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7259-00000126"/> drops,—a river of tears, as you
                     gather him convulsively to your bosom!</p>
                  <p>"Father, why do you cry so?" says Frank, with the tears of dreadful sympathy
                     starting from those eyes of childhood.</p>
                  <p>——"Why, Papa?"—mimes little Nelly.</p>
                  <p>——Answer them if you dare! Try it;—what words—blundering, weak words,—choked
                     with agony,—leading no where,—ending in new, and convulsive clasps of your
                     weeping, motherless children!</p>
                  <p>Had she gone to her grave, there would have been a holy joy—a great, and
                     swelling grief indeed,—but your poor heart would have found a rest in the quiet
                     churchyard; and your feelings rooted in that cherished grave, would have
                     stretched up toward Heaven their delicate leaves, and caught the dews of His
                     grace, who watcheth the lilies. But now,—with your heart cast under foot, or
                     buffeted on the lips of a lying world,—finding no shelter, and no abiding
                     place——alas, we do guess at infinitude, only by suffering!</p>
                  <p>——Madge, Madge! can this be so? Are you not still the same, sweet, guileless
                     child of Heaven?</p>

                  <p>IT is a dream;—fearful to be sure,—but only a dream! Madge <emph>is</emph>
                     true. That soul is honest; it could not be otherwise. God never made it to be
                     false; He never made the sun for darkness.</p>
                  <p>And before the evening has waned to midnight, sweet day has broken on your
                     gloom;—Madge is folded to your bosom;—sobbing fearfully;—not for guilt, or any
                     shadow of guilt, but for the agony she reads upon your brow, and in your low
                     sighs.</p>
                  <p>The mystery is all cleared by a few lightning words from her indignant lips;
                     and her whole figure trembles, as she shrinks within your embrace, with the
                     thought of that great evil, that seemed to shadow you. The villain has sought
                     by every art to beguile her into appearance<pb n="252-253"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000127"/> pearance which should compromise her character,
                     and so wound her delicacy, as to take away the courage for return: he has even
                     wrought upon her affection for you, as his master-weapon: a skilfully-contrived
                     story of some accident that had befallen you, had wrought upon her—to the
                     sudden, and silent leave of home. But he has failed. At the first suspicion of
                     his falsity, her dignity and virtue shivered all his malice. She shudders at
                     the bare thought of that fiendish scheme, which has so lately broken on her
                     view.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Clarence, Clarence, could you for one moment believe this of me?"</p>
                  <p>"Dear Madge, forgive me, if a dreamy horror did for an instant palsy my better
                     thought;—it is gone utterly;—it will never—never come again!"</p>
                  <p>And there she leans, with her head pillowed on your shoulder, the same sweet
                     angel, that has led you in the way of light; and who is still your blessing,
                     and your pride.</p>
                  <p>He—and you forbear to name his name—is gone;—flying vainly from the
                     consciousness of guilt, with the curse of Cain upon him,—hastening toward the
                     day, when Satan shall clutch his own!</p>
                  <p>A heavenly peace descends upon you that night;—all the more sacred and calm,
                     for the fearful agony that has gone before. A Heaven that seemed lost, is
                     yours. A love that you had almost doubted, is beyond all suspicion. A heart
                     that in the madness of your frenzy, you had dared to question, you worship now,
                     with blushes of shame. You thank God, for this great goodness, as you never
                     thanked him for any earthly blessing before; and with this twin gratitude lying
                     on your hearts, and clearing your face to smiles, you live on together the old
                     life of joy, and of affection.</p>
                  <p>Again with brimming nectar, the years fill up their vases. Your children grow
                     into the same earnest joyousness, and with the same home faith, which lightened
                     upon your young dreams; and toward which, you seem to go back, as you riot with
                     them in their Christmas joys, or upon the velvety lawn of June.</p>
                  <p>Anxieties indeed overtake you; but they are those anxieties which only the
                     selfish would avoid—anxieties that better the heart, with a great weight of
                     tenderness. It may be, that your mischievous Frank runs wild with the swift
                     blood of boyhood, and that the hours are long, which wait his coming. It may be
                     that your heart echoes in silence, the mother's sobs, as she watches his fits
                     of waywardness, and showers upon his very neglect, excess of love.</p>
                  <p>Danger perhaps creeps upon little, joyous Nelly, which makes you tremble for
                     her life; the mother's tears are checked that she may not deepen your grief;
                     and her care guards the little sufferer, like a Providence<pb n="254-255"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000128"/> dence. The nights hang long and heavy; dull,
                     stifled breathing wakes the chamber with ominous sound; the mother's eye scarce
                     closes, but rests with fond sadness upon the little struggling victim of
                     sickness; her hand rests like an angel touch upon the brow, all beaded with the
                     heats of fever; the straggling, gray light of morning breaks through the
                     crevices of the closed blinds,—bringing stir, and bustle to the world, but, in
                     your home,—lighting only the darkness.</p>
                  <p>Hope sinking in the mother's heart, takes hold on Faith in God; and her prayer,
                     and her placid look of submission,—more than all your philosophy,—add strength
                     to your faltering courage.</p>
                  <p>But little Nelly brightens; her faded features take on bloom again; she knows
                     you; she presses your hand; she draws down your cheek to her parched lip; she
                     kisses you, and smiles. The mother's brow loses its shadow; day dawns within,
                     as well as without; and on bended knees, God is thanked!</p>
                  <p>Perhaps poverty faces you;—your darling schemes break down. One by one, with
                     failing heart, you strip the luxuries from life. But the sorrow which oppresses
                     you, is not the selfish sorrow which the lone man feels; it is far nobler; its
                     chiefest mourning is over the despoiled home. Frank must give up his promised
                     travel; Madge must lose her favorite pony; Nelly must be denied her little fête
                     upon the lawn. The home itself, endeared by so many scenes of happiness, and by
                     so many of suffering—must be given up. It is hard—very hard to tear away your
                     wife, from the flowers, the birds, the luxuries, that she has made so dear.</p>
                  <p>Now, she is far stronger than you. She contrives new joys; she wears a holy
                     calm; she cheers by a new hopefulness; she buries even the memory of luxury, in
                     the riches of the humble home, that her wealth of heart endows. Her soul,
                     catching radiance from that Heavenly world, where her hope lives, kindles amid
                     the growing shadows, and sheds balm upon the little griefs,—like the serene
                     moon, slanting the dead sun's life, upon the night!</p>
                  <p>Courage wakes in the presence of those dependent on your toil. Love arms your
                     hand, and quickens your brain. Resolutions break large from the swelling soul.
                     Energy leaps into your action, like light. Gradually you bring back into your
                     humble home, a few traces of the luxury that once adorned it. That wife whom it
                     is your greatest pleasure to win to smiles,—wears a half sad look, as she meets
                     these proofs of love; she fears that you are perilling too much, for her
                     pleasure.</p>
                  <p>——For the first time in life you deceive her. You have won wealth again; you
                     now step firmly upon your<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7259-00000129"/> new-gained
                     sandals of gold. But you conceal it from her. You contrive a little scheme of
                     surprise, with Frank alone, in the secret.</p>
                  <p>You purchase again the old home; you stock it, as far as may be, with the old
                     luxuries; a new harp is in the place of that one which beguiled so many hours
                     of joy; new and cherished flowers bloom again upon the window; her birds hang,
                     and warble their melody, where they warbled it before. A pony—like as possible
                     to the old—is there for Madge; a fête is secretly contrived upon the lawn. You
                     even place the old, familiar books, upon the parlor table.</p>
                  <p>The birth-day of your own Madge, is approaching:—a fête you never pass by,
                     without home-rejoicings. You drive over with her, upon that morning, for
                     another look at the old place; a cloud touches her brow,—but she yields to your
                     wish. An old servant,—whom you had known in better days—throws open the
                     gates.</p>
                  <p>——"It is too—too sad," says Madge—"let us go back, Clarence, to our own
                     home;—we are happy there."</p>
                  <p>——"A little farther, Madge."</p>
                  <p>The wife steps slowly over what seems the sepulchre of so many pleasures; the
                     children gambol as of old, and pick flowers. But the mother checks them.</p>
                  <p>"They are not ours now, my children!"</p>
                  <p>You stroll to the very door; the goldfinches are hanging upon the wall; the
                     mignionette is in the window. You feel the hand of Madge trembling upon your
                     arm; she is struggling with her weakness.</p>
                  <p>A tidy waiting woman shows you into the old parlor:——there is a harp; and there
                     too, such books as we loved to read.</p>
                  <p>Madge is overcome; now, she entreats:—"Let us go away, Clarence!" and she hides
                     her face.</p>
                  <p>——"Never, dear Madge, never! it is yours—all yours!"</p>
                  <p>She looks up in your face; she sees your look of triumph; she catches sight of
                     Frank bursting in at the old hall-door, all radiant with joy.</p>
                  <p>——"Frank!—Clarence!"—the tears forbid any more.</p>
                  <p>"God bless you, Madge! God bless you!"</p>
                  <p>And thus, in peace and in joy, MANHOOD passes on into the third season of our
                     life—even as golden AUTUMN, sinks slowly into the tomb of WINTER.</p>

               <head>DREAMS OF AGE.</head>
               <head>WINTER.</head>
               <p>SLOWLY, thickly, fastly, fall the snow flakes,—like the seasons upon the life of
                  man. At the first, they lose themselves in the brown mat of herbage, or gently
                  melt, as they fall upon the broad stepping stone at the door. But as hour after
                  hour passes, the feathery flakes stretch their white cloak plainly on the meadow,
                  and chilling the doorstep with their multitude, cover it with a mat of pearl.</p>
               <p>The dried grass tips pierce the mantle of white, like so many serried spears; but
                  as the storm goes softly on, they sink one by one to their snowy tomb; and
                  presently show nothing of all their army, save one or two straggling banners of
                  blackened and shrunken daisies.</p>
               <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7259-00000132"/>
               <p>Across the wide meadow that stretches from my window, I can see nothing of those
                  hills which were so green in summer: between me and them, lie only the soft, slow
                  moving masses, filling the air with whiteness. I catch only a glimpse of one
                  gaunt, and bare-armed oak, looming through the feathery multitude, like a tall
                  ship's spars breaking through fog.</p>
               <p>The roof of the barn is covered; and the leaking eaves show dark stains of water,
                  that trickle down the weather-beaten boards. The pear-trees that wore such weight
                  of greenness in the leafy June, now stretch their bare arms to the snowy blast,
                  and carry upon each tiny bough, a narrow burden of winter.</p>
               <p>The old house dog marches stately through the strange covering of earth, and seems
                  to ponder on the welcome he will show,—and shakes the flakes from his long ears,
                  and with a vain snap at a floating feather, he stalks again to his dry covert in
                  the shed. The lambs that belonged to the meadow flock, with their feeding ground
                  all covered, seem to wonder at their losses; but take courage from the quiet air
                  of the veteran sheep, and gambol after them, as they move sedately toward the
                  shelter of the barn.</p>
               <p>The cat, driven from the kitchen door, beats a coy retreat, with long reaches of
                  her foot, upon the yielding surface. The matronly hens saunter out, at a little
                  lifting of the storm; and eye curiously, with heads half turned, their sinking
                  steps; and then fall back with a quiet cluck of satisfaction, to the wholesome
                  gravel by the stable door.</p>
               <p>By and by, the snow flakes pile more leisurely: they grow large and scattered, and
                  come more slowly than before. The hills that were brown, heave into sight—great,
                  rounded billows of white. The gray woods look shrunken to half their height, and
                  stand waving in the storm. The wind freshens, and scatters the light flakes that
                  crown the burden of the snow; and as the day droops, a clear, bright sky of steel
                  color, cleaves the land, and clouds, and sends down a chilling wind to bank the
                  walls, and to freeze the storm. The moon rises full and round, and plays with a
                  joyous chill, over the glistening raiment of the land.</p>
               <p>I pile my fire with the clean cleft hickory; and musing over some sweet story of
                  the olden time, I wander into a rich realm of thought, until my eyes grow dim, and
                  dreaming of battle and of prince, I fall to sleep in my old farm chamber.</p>
               <p>At morning, I find my dreams all written on the window, in crystals of fairy
                  shape. The cattle, one by one, with ears frost-tipped, and with frosted noses,
                  wend their way to the watering-place in the meadow. One by one they drink, and
                  crop at the stunted herbage, which the warm spring keeps green and bare.</p>
               <p>A hound bays in the distance; the smoke of cottages<pb n="264-265"
                     xml:id="VAC7259-00000133"/> tages rises straight toward Heaven; a lazy jingle
                  of sleigh-bells wakens the quiet of the high-road; and upon the hills, the
                  leafless woods stand low, like crouching armies, with guns and spears in rest; and
                  among them, the scattered spiral pines rise like banner-men, uttering with their
                  thousand tongues of green, the proud war-cry—'God is with us!'</p>
               <p>But, the sky of winter is as capricious as the sky of spring—even as the old
                  wander in thought, like the vagaries of a boy.</p>
               <p>Before noon, the heavens are mantled with a leaden gray; the eaves that leaked in
                  the glow of the sun, now tell their tale of morning's warmth, in crystal ranks of
                  icicles. The cattle seek their shelter; the few, lingering leaves of the white
                  oaks, rustle dismally; the pines breathe sighs of mourning. As the night darkens,
                  and deepens the storm, the house dog bays; the children crouch in the wide chimney
                  corners; the sleety rain comes in sharp gusts. And, as I sit by the light leaping
                  blaze in my chamber, the scattered hail-drops beat upon my window, like the
                  tappings of an OLD MAN'S cane.</p>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>I.</head>
                  <head type="sub">WHAT IS GONE.</head>
                  <p>GONE! Did it ever strike you, my reader, how much meaning lies in that little
                     monosyllable—gone?</p>
                  <p>Say it to yourself at nightfall, when the sun has sunk under the hills, and the
                     crickets chirp—'gone. Say it to yourself, when the night is far over, and you
                     wake with some sudden start, from pleasant dreams,—'gone.' Say it to yourself
                     in some country churchyard, where your father, or your mother, sleeps under the
                     blooming violets of spring—'gone.' Say it, in your sobbing prayer to Heaven, as
                     you cling lovingly, but oh, how vainly, to the hand of your sweet
                     wife—'gone!'</p>
                  <p>Aye, is there not meaning in it? And now, what is gone:—or rather, what is not
                     gone? Childhood is<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7259-00000134"/> gone with all its
                     blushes, and fairness,—with all its health and wanton,—with all its smiles,
                     like glimpses of heaven; and all its tears, which were but the suffusion of
                     joy.</p>
                  <p>Youth is gone;—bright, hopeful youth, when you counted the years with jewelled
                     numbers, and hung lamps of ambition at your path, which lighted the palace of
                     renown;—when the days were woven into weeks of blithe labor, and the weeks were
                     rolled into harvest months of triumph, and the months were bound into golden
                     sheaves of years—all, gone!</p>
                  <p>The strength and pride of manhood is gone; your heart and soul have stamped
                     their deepest dye; the time of power is past; your manliness has told its tale;
                     henceforth your career is <emph>down;</emph>——hitherto, you have journeyed
                        <emph>up.</emph> You look back upon a decade, as you once looked upon a half
                     score of months; a year has become to your slackened memory, and to your dull
                     perceptions, like a week of childhood. Suddenly and swiftly, come past you,
                     great whirls of gone-by thought, and wrecks of vain labor, eddying upon the
                     stream that rushes to the grave. The sweeping outlines of life, that lay once
                     before the vision—rolling into wide billows of years, like easy lifts of a
                     broad mountain-range,—now seem close-packed together, as with a Titan hand; and
                     you see only crowded, craggy heights,—like Alpine fastnesses—parted with
                     glaciers of grief, and leaking abundant tears!</p>
                  <p>Your friends are gone;—they who counselled and advised you, and who protected
                     your weakness, will guard it no more forever. One by one, they have dropped
                     away as you have journeyed on; and yet your journey does not seem a long one.
                     Life, at the longest, is but a bubble that bursts, so soon as it is
                     rounded.</p>
                  <p>Nelly, your sweet sister, to whom your heart clung so fondly in the young days,
                     and to whom it has clung ever since, in the strongest bonds of
                     companionship,—is gone,—with the rest!</p>
                  <p>Your thought,—wayward now, and flickering,—runs over the old days with quick,
                     and fevered step; it brings back, faintly as it may, the noisy joys, and the
                     safety, that belonged to the old garret roof; it figures again the image of
                     that calm-faced father,—long since sleeping beside your mother; it rests like a
                     shadow, upon the night when Charlie died; it grasps the old figures of the
                     school-room, and kindles again (how strange is memory), the fire that shed its
                     lustre upon the curtains, and the ceiling, as you lay groaning with your first
                     hours of sickness.</p>
                  <p>Your flitting recollection brings back with gushes of exultation, the figure of
                     that little, blue-eyed hoyden,—Madge,—as she came with her work, to pass the
                     long evenings with Nelly; it calls again the shy glances that<pb n="268-269"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000135"/> you cast upon her, and your naïve ignorance of
                     all the little counter-play, that might well have passed between Frank and
                     Nelly. Your mother's form too, clear and distinct, comes upon the wave of your
                     rocking thought; her smile touches you now in age, as it never touched you in
                     boyhood.</p>
                  <p>The image of that fair Miss Dalton, who led your fancy into such mad captivity,
                     glides across your vision like the fragment of a crazy dream—long gone by. The
                     country-home, where lived the grandfather of Frank, gleams kindly in the
                     sunlight of your memory; and still,—poor, blind Fanny,—long since gathered to
                     that rest, where her closed eyes will open upon visions of joy,—draws forth a
                     sigh of pity.</p>
                  <p>Then, comes up that sweetest, and brightest vision of love, and the doubt and
                     care which ran before it,—when your hope groped eagerly through your pride, and
                     worldliness, toward the sainted purity of her, whom you know to be—all too
                     good;—when you trembled at the thought of your own vices, and blackness, in the
                     presence of her, who seemed—virtue's self. And even now, your old heart bounds
                     with joy, as you recal the first timid assurance,—that you were blessed in the
                     possession of her love, and that you might live in her smiles.</p>
                  <p>Your thought runs like floating melody, over the calm joy that followed you
                     through so many years;—to the prattling children, who were there to bless your
                     path. How poor, seem now your transports, as you met their childish embraces,
                     and mingled in their childish employ;—how utterly weak, the actual, when
                     compared with that glow of affection, which memory lends to the scene!</p>
                  <p>Yet all this is gone; and the anxieties are gone, which knit your heart so
                     strongly to those children, and to her—the mother;—anxieties which distressed
                     you,—which you would eagerly have shunned; yet, whose memory you would not now
                     bargain away, for a king's ransom! What were the sunlight worth, if clouds did
                     not sometimes hide its brightness; what were the spring, or the summer, if the
                     lessons of the chilling winter did not teach us the story of their warmth?</p>
                  <p>The days are gone too, in which you may have lingered under the sweet suns of
                     Italy,—with the cherished one beside you, and the eager children, learning new
                     prattle, in the soft language of those Eastern lands. The evenings are gone, in
                     which you loitered under the trees, with those dear does, under the light of a
                     harvest moon, and talked of your blooming hopes, and of the stirring plans of
                     your manhood. There are no more ambitious hopes—no more sturdy plans! Life's
                     work has rounded into the evening that shortens labor.</p>
                  <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7259-00000136"/>
                  <p>And as you loiter in dreams over the wide waste of what is gone,—a mingled
                     array of griefs and of joys—of failures, and of triumphs,—you bless God, that
                     there has been so much of joy, belonging to your shattered life; and you pray
                     God, with the vain fondness that belongs to a parent's heart,—that more of joy,
                     and less of toil, may come near to the cherished ones, who bear up your hope
                     and name.</p>
                  <p>And with your silent prayer, comes back the old teachings, and vagaries of the
                     boyish heart, in its reaches toward Heaven. You recal the old church-reckoning
                     of your goodness: is there much more of it now, than then? Is not Heaven just
                     as high, and the world as sadly—broad?</p>
                  <p>Alas, for the poor tale of goodness, which age brings to the memory! There may
                     be crowning acts of benevolence, shining here and there; but the margin of what
                     has not been done, is very broad. How weak and insignificant, seems the story
                     of life's goodness, and profit, when Death begins to slant his shadow upon our
                     souls! How infinite, in the comparison, seems that Eternal goodness, which is
                     crowned with mercy. How self vanishes, like a blasted thing; and only lives—if
                     it lives at all,—in the glow of that redeeming light, which radiates from the
                     CROSS, and the THRONE!</p>

                  <head type="sub">WHAT IS LEFT.</head>
                  <p>BUT much as there is gone of life, and of its joys,—very much remains;—very
                     much in earnest, and very much more in hope. Still, you see visions, and you
                     dream dreams, of the times that are to come.</p>
                  <p>Your home, and heart are left; within that home, the old Bible holds its wonted
                     place, which was the monitor of your boyhood; and now, more than ever, it
                     prompts those reverent reaches of the spirit, which go beyond even the track of
                     dreams.</p>
                  <p>That cherished Madge, the partner of your life and joy, still lingers, though
                     her step is feeble, and her eyes are dimmed;—not, as once, attracting you by
                     any outward show of beauty; your heart glowing through<pb n="272-273"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000137"/> the memory of a life of joy, needs no such
                     stimulant to the affections. Your hearts are knit together by a habit of
                     growth, and a unanimity of desire. There is less to remind of the vanities of
                     earth, and more to quicken the hopes of a time, when body yields to spirit.</p>
                  <p>Your own poor, battered hulk, wants no jaunty-trimmed craft for consort; but
                     twin of heart, and soul, as you are twin of years, you float tranquilly toward
                     that haven, which lies before us all.</p>
                  <p>Your children, now almost verging on maturity, bless your hearth, and home. Not
                     one is gone. Frank indeed, that wild fellow of a youth, who has wrought your
                     heart into perplexing anxieties again and again, as you have seen the wayward
                     dashes of his young blood,—is often away. But his heart yet centres, where
                     yours centres; and his absence is only a nearer, and bolder strife, with that
                     fierce world, whose circumstances, every man of force, and energy, is born to
                     conquer.</p>
                  <p>His return, from time to time, with that proud figure of opening manliness, and
                     that full flush of health, speaks to your affections, as you could never have
                     believed it would. It is not for a man, who is the father of a man, to show any
                     weakness of the heart, or any over-sensitiveness, in those ties which bind him
                     to his kin. And yet—yet, as you sit by your fire-side, with your clear, gray
                     eye, feasting in its feebleness on that proud figure of a man,—who calls
                     you—'father,'—and as you see his fond, and loving attentions to that one, who
                     has been your partner in all anxieties, and joys,—there <emph>is</emph> a
                     throbbing within your bosom that makes you almost wish him young again:—that
                     you might embrace him now, as when he warbled in your rejoicing ear, those
                     first words of love!——Ah, how little does a son know the secret and craving
                     tenderness of a parent;—how little conception has he, of those silent bursts of
                     fondness, and of joy, which attend his coming, and which crown his parting!</p>
                  <p>There is young Madge too,—dark-eyed, tall, with a pensive shadow resting on her
                     face,—the very image of refinement, and of delicacy. She is thoughtful;—not
                     breaking out, like the hoyden, flax-haired Nelly, into bursts of joy, and
                     singing,—but stealing upon your heart, with a gentle and quiet tenderness, that
                     diffuses itself throughout the household, like a soft zephyr of summer.</p>
                  <p>There are friends too yet left, who come in upon your evening hours; and light
                     up the loitering time with dreamy story of the years that are gone. How eagerly
                     you listen to some gossipping veteran friend, who with his deft words, calls up
                     the thread of some bye-gone years of life; and with what a careless, yet
                     grateful recognition, you lapse, as it were, into the<pb n="274-275"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000138"/> current of the past; and live over again, by
                     your hospitable blaze, the stir, the joy, and the pride of your lost
                     manhood.</p>
                  <p>The children of friends too, have grown upon your march; and come to welcome
                     you with that reverent deference, which always touches the heart of age. That
                     wild boy Will.,—the son of a dear friend—who but a little while ago, was
                     worrying you with his boyish pranks, has now shot up into tall, and graceful
                     youth; and evening after evening, finds him making part of your little
                     household group.</p>
                  <p>——Does the fond old man think that <emph>he</emph> is all the attraction!</p>
                  <p>It may be that in your dreamy speculations, about the future of your children
                     (for still you dream) you think that Will., may possibly become the husband of
                     the sedate and kindly Madge. It worries you to find Nelly teasing him as she
                     does; that mad hoyden will never be quiet; she provokes you excessively;—and
                     yet, she is a dear creature; there is no meeting those laughing blue eyes of
                     hers, without a smile, and an embrace!</p>
                  <p>It pleases you however to see the winning frankness, with which Madge always
                     receives Will. And with a little of your old vanity of observation, you trace
                     out the growth of their dawning attachment. It provokes you, to find Nelly
                     breaking up their quiet <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tête-à-têtes</foreign> with her
                     provoking sallies; and drawing away Will. to some saunter in the garden, or to
                     some mad gallop over the hills.</p>
                  <p>At length, upon a certain summer's day, Will. asks to see you. He approaches
                     with a doubtful, and disturbed look; you fear that wild Nell has been teasing
                     him with her pranks. Yet he wears, not so much an offended look, as one of
                     fear. You wonder if it ever happened to you, to carry your hat in just that
                     timid manner, and to wear such a shifting expression of the eye, as poor Will.
                     wears just now? You wonder if it ever happened to you, to begin to talk with an
                     old friend of your father's, in just that abashed way? Will. must have fallen
                     into some sad scrape.——Well, he is a good fellow, and you will help him out of
                     it!</p>
                  <p>You look up as he goes on with his story;—you grow perplexed yourself;—you
                     scarce believe your own ears.</p>
                  <p>——"Nelly?"—Is Will. talking of Nelly?</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir,—Nelly."</p>
                  <p>——"What!—and you have told all this to Nelly—that you love her?"</p>
                  <p>"I have, sir."</p>
                  <p>"And she says—"</p>
                  <p>"That I must speak with you, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Bless my soul!—But she's a good girl;"—and the old man wipes his eyes.</p>
                  <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7259-00000139"/>
                  <p>——"Nell!—are you there?"</p>
                  <p>And she comes,—blushing, lingering, yet smiling through it all.</p>
                  <p>——"And you could deceive your old father, Nell——" (very fondly.)</p>
                  <p>Nelly only clasps your hand in both of hers.</p>
                  <p>"And so you loved Will., all the while?"</p>
                  <p>——Nelly only stoops, to drop a little kiss of pleading on your forehead.</p>
                  <p>——"Well, Nelly" (it is hard to speak roundly), "give me your hand;—here
                     Will.,—take it:—she's a wild girl;—be kind to her, Will.?"</p>
                  <p>"God bless you, sir!"</p>
                  <p>And Nelly throws herself, sobbing, upon your bosom.</p>
                  <p>——"Not here,—not here, now, Nell!—Will. is yonder!"</p>
                  <p>——Sobbing, sobbing still! Nelly, Nelly,—who would have thought that your merry
                     face, covered such heart of tenderness!</p>

                  <head type="sub">GRIEF AND JOY OF AGE.</head>
                  <p>THE winter has its piercing storms,—even as Autumn hath. Hoary age, crowned
                     with honor, and with years, bears no immunity from suffering. It is the common
                     heritage of us all: if it come not in the spring, or in the summer of our day,
                     it will surely find us in the autumn, or amid the frosts of winter. It is the
                     penalty humanity pays for pleasure; human joys will have their balance. Nature
                     never makes false weight. The east wind is followed by a wind from the west;
                     and every smile, will have its equivalent—in a tear!</p>
                  <p>You have lived long, and joyously, with that dear one, who has made your life—a
                     holy pilgrimage. She has seemed to lead you into ways of pleasantness, and<pb
                        n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7259-00000140"/> has kindled in you—as the damps of
                     the world came near to extinguish them,—those hopes and aspirations, which rest
                     not in life, but soar to the realm of spirits.</p>
                  <p>You have sometimes shuddered with the thought of parting; you have trembled
                     even at the leave-taking of a year, or—of months; and have suffered bitterly,
                     as some danger threatened a parting—forever. That danger threatens now. Nor is
                     it a sudden fear, to startle you into a paroxysm of dread—nothing of this.
                     Nature is kinder,—or, she is less kind.</p>
                  <p>It is a slow, and certain approach of danger, which you read in the feeble
                     step,—in the wan eye, lighting up from time to time, into a brightness that
                     seems no longer of this world. You read it in the new, and ceaseless attentions
                     of the fond child who yet blesses your home; and who conceals from you the
                     bitterness of the coming grief.</p>
                  <p>Frank is away—over seas; and as the mother mentions that name with a tremor of
                     love, and of regret, that he is not now with you all,—you recal that other
                     death, when you too,—were not there. Then you knew little of a parent's
                     feeling;—now, its intensity is present!</p>
                  <p>Day after day, as summer passes, she is ripening for that world where her
                     faith, and her hope, have so long lived. Her pressure of your hand at some
                     casual parting ing for a day, is full of a gentle warning—as if she
                     said—prepare for a longer adieu!</p>
                  <p>Her language too, without direct mention, steeps your thought in the bitter
                     certainty that she foresees her approaching doom; and that she dreads it, only
                     so far as she dreads the grief, that will be left in her broken home. Madge—the
                     daughter,—glides through the duties of that household, like an angel of mercy:
                     she lingers at the sick bed—blessing, and taking blessings.</p>
                  <p>The sun shines warmly without; and through the open casement, beats warmly upon
                     the floor within. The birds sing in the joyousness of full-robed summer; the
                     drowsy hum of the bees, stealing sweets from the honeysuckle that bowers the
                     window, lulls the air to a gentle quiet. Her breathing scarce breaks the summer
                     stillness. Yet, she knows it is nearly over. Madge, too,—with features
                     saddened, yet struggling against grief,—feels—that it is nearly over.</p>
                  <p>It is very hard to think it;—how much harder to know it! But there is no
                     mistaking her look now—so placid, so gentle, so resigned! And her grasp of your
                     hand—so warm—so full of meaning!</p>
                  <p>——"Madge, Madge, must it be?" And a pleasant smile lights her eye; and her
                     grasp is warmer; and her look is—upward!</p>
                  <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7259-00000141"/>
                  <p>——"Must it,—must it be, dear Madge?"——A holier smile,—loftier,—lit up of
                     angels, beams on her faded features. The hand relaxes its clasp; and you cling
                     to it faster—harder;—joined close to the frail wreck of your love;—joined
                     tightly—but oh, how far apart!</p>
                  <p>She is in Heaven;—and you, struggling against the grief of a lorn, old man!</p>
                  <p>But sorrow, however great it be, must be subdued in the presence of a child.
                     Its fevered outbursts must be kept for those silent hours, when no young eyes
                     are watching, and no young hearts will "catch the trick of grief."</p>
                  <p>When the household is quiet, and darkened;—when Madge is away from you, and
                     your boy Frank slumbering—as youth slumbers upon sorrow;—when you are alone
                     with God, and the night,—in that room so long hallowed by her presence, but
                     now—deserted—silent;—then you may yield yourself to such frenzy of tears, as
                     your strength will let you! And in your solitary rambles through the
                     churchyard, you can loiter of a summer's noon, over <emph>her</emph> fresh-made
                     grave, and let your pent heart speak, and your spirit lean toward the Rest,
                     where her love has led you!</p>
                  <p>Thornton—the clergyman, whose prayer over the dead, has dwelt with you, comes
                     from time to time, to light up your solitary hearth, with his talk of the
                     Rest—for all men. He is young, but his earnest, and gentle speech, win their
                     way to your heart, and to your understanding. You love his counsels; you make
                     of him a friend, whose visits are long, and often repeated.</p>
                  <p>Frank only lingers for a while; and you bid him again—adieu. It seems to you
                     that it may well be the last; and your blessing trembles on your lip. Yet you
                     look not with dread, but rather, with a firm trustfulness toward the day of the
                     end. For your darling Madge, it is true, you have anxieties; you fear to leave
                     her lonely in the world, with no protector save the wayward Frank.</p>
                  <p>It is later August, when you call to Madge one day, to bring you the little
                     escritoire, in which are your cherished papers;—among them is your last will
                     and testament. Thornton has just left you; and it seems to you that his
                     repeated kindnesses are deserving of some substantial mark of your regard.</p>
                  <p>"Maggie"—you say, "Mr. Thornton has been very kind to me."</p>
                  <p>"Very kind, father."</p>
                  <p>"I mean to leave him here, some little legacy, Maggie."</p>
                  <p>"I would not, father."</p>
                  <p>"But Madge, my daughter!"</p>
                  <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7259-00000142"/>
                  <p>"He is not looking for such return, father."</p>
                  <p>"But he has been very kind, Madge; I must show him some strong token of my
                     regard. What shall it be, Maggie?"</p>
                  <p>Madge hesitates;—Madge blushes;—Madge stoops to her father's ear, as if the
                     very walls might catch the secret of her heart;—"Would you give <emph>me</emph>
                     to him, father?"</p>
                  <p>"But—my dear Madge—has he asked this?"</p>
                  <p>"Eight months ago, papa."</p>
                  <p>"And you told him——"</p>
                  <p>"That I would never leave you, so long as you lived!"</p>
                  <p>——"My own dear Madge,—come to me,—kiss me! And you love him, Maggie?"</p>
                  <p>"With all my heart, sir."</p>
                  <p>——"So like your mother,—the same figure,—the same true honest heart! It shall
                     be as you wish, dear Madge. Only, you will not leave me in my old age;—Eh,
                     Maggie?"</p>
                  <p>——"Never, father, never."</p>
                  <p>——And there she leans upon his chair;—her arm around the old man's neck,—her
                     other hand clasped in his; and her eyes melting with tenderness, as she gazes
                     upon his aged face,—all radiant with joy, and with hope!</p>

                  <p>A FEEBLE old man, and a young lady, who is just now blooming into the maturity
                     of womanhood, are toiling up a gentle slope, where the spring sun lies warmly.
                     The old man totters, though he leans heavily upon his cane; and he pants, as he
                     seats himself upon a mossy rock, that crowns the summit of the slope. As he
                     recovers breath, he draws the hand of the lady in his, and with a trembling
                     eagerness he points out an old mansion that lies below under the shadow of tall
                     sycamores; and he says—feebly and brokenly,——"That is it, Maggie,—the old
                     home,—the sycamores,—the garret,—Charlie,—Nelly"——</p>
                  <p>The old man wipes his eyes. Then his hand shifts:<pb n="284-285"
                        xml:id="VAC7259-00000143"/> he seems groping in darkness; but soon it rests
                     upon a little cottage below, heavily overshadowed:—</p>
                  <p>"That was it, Maggie:—Madge lived there—sweet Madge,—your mother,"——</p>
                  <p>Again the old man wipes his eyes, and the lady turns away.</p>
                  <p>Presently they walk down the hill together. They cross a little valley, with
                     slow, faltering steps. The lady guides him carefully, until they reach a little
                     graveyard.</p>
                  <p>"This must be it, Maggie, but the fence is new. There it is Maggie, under the
                     willow,—my poor mother's grave!"</p>
                  <p>The lady weeps.</p>
                  <p>"Thank you, Madge: you did not know her, but you weep for me:—God bless
                     you!"</p>
                  <p>The old man is in the midst of his household. It is some festive day. He holds
                     feebly his place, at the head of the board. He utters in feeble tones—a
                     Thanksgiving.</p>
                  <p>His married Nelly is there, with two blooming children. Frank is there, with
                     his bride. Madge—dearest of all,—is seated beside the old man, watchful of his
                     comfort, and assisting him, as, with a shadowy dignity, he essays to do the
                     honors of the board. The children prattle merrily: the elder ones talk of the
                     days gone by; and the old man enters feebly—yet with floating glimpses of
                     glee,—into the cheer, and the rejoicings.</p>
                  <p>——Poor old man, he is near his tomb! Yet his calm eye, looking upward, seems to
                     show no fear.</p>
                  <p>The same old man is in his chamber: he cannot leave his chair now. Madge is
                     beside him: Nelly is there too, with her eldest-born. Madge has been reading to
                     the old man:—it was a passage of promise—of the Bible promise.</p>
                  <p>"A glorious promise,"—says the old man feebly."——A promise to me,—a promise to
                     her—poor Madge!"</p>
                  <p>——"Is her picture there, Maggie?"</p>
                  <p>Madge brings it to him: he turns his head; but the light is not strong. They
                     wheel his chair to the window. The sun is shining brightly:—still the old man
                     cannot see.</p>
                  <p>"It is getting dark, Maggie."</p>
                  <p>Madge looks at Nelly—wistfully—sadly.</p>
                  <p>The old man murmurs something; and Madge stoops:——"Coming," he
                     says——"coming!"</p>
                  <p>Nelly brings the little child to take his hand. Perhaps it will revive him. She
                     lifts her boy to kiss his cheek.</p>
                  <pb n="286-287 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7259-00000144"/>
                  <p>The old man does not stir: his eyes do not move:—they seem fixed above. The
                     child cries as his lips touch the cold cheek:——It is a tender SPRING flower,
                     upon the bosom of the dying WINTER!</p>
                  <p>——The old man is gone: his dream life is ended.</p>

            <head type="sub">DARLEY'S ILLUSTRATED EDITION OF</head>
            <head>Reveries of a Bachelor,</head>
            <head type="sub">Or. A Book of the heart—By Ik. Marvel.</head>
            <head type="sub">With 25 Illustrations by Darley.</head>
            <p>1 Vol. 8vo.—Cloth full gilt,$4 00; Morocco extra, $6 00.</p>
            <p>The well-deserved popularity of this charming book, has led the publisher, Mr.
               Scribner, to issue an edition with highly-finished illustrations by Darley, who has
               shown himself as much the artist in some of these quiet, dreamy, thought-pervading
               scenes, as in the more stirring pictures for which he is so distinguished. The volume
               is not only exquisitely embellished, but printed and bound in elegant style, thus
               securing for it a prominent place among the presentation books of the
                  season.—<title>Arthurs Home Gazette.</title>
            </p>
            <p>The designs are by Darley, and certainly the work could have been intrusted to no one
               more competent. It was a delicate task he had to perform, to embody the tender and
               beautiful fancies of his author, but he has done it with a grace and skill which
               leave nothing to be desired. He has surpassed himself, and evinced a talent for
               embodying sentiment beyond what seems indicated by his previous productions. The
               whole book is, in fact, a perfect work of art, "beautiful
                  exceedingly."—<title>American Review.</title>
            </p>
            <p>He has so chimed in with the Bachelor's prevailing tone, that gentleness, tenderness,
               and grace are reflected from the printed to the engraved page. It is no slight merit
               for an artist thus to catch the hue of the author; the engravers, also, deserve high
               credit for doing justice to Mr. Darley's designs; and, in short, this octavo volume
               is beautifully complete in all respects.—<title>The Albion.</title>
            </p>
            <p>The illustrations by Darley are in admirable keeping with its varied themes. They are
                  <emph>illustrations,</emph> characteristic of the subject, some of them in
               excellent point. Aunt Tabithy scratching her head with her disengaged knitting
               needle, your "second flame" presenting to you her two charming boys, the dreamer
               soliloquizing over the wood fire, with his favorite dog beside him, the cattle
               reposing at noon-tide in the shade, the grief-stricken father drooping in cheerless
               agony, the love-scene in the woods, are all happy conceptions of the artist, and are
               finished with capital effect.—<title>The Independent.</title>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Darley has shown his usual command over the expression of character and
               feeling—he is generally not so successful in the effects of light and shadow as in
               form; but these illustrations are certainly better in the quality we allude to than
               the drawings for Irving's Works, or any of the Artist's previous
                  productions.—<title>American Art Union Bulletin.</title>

            <p>Agreeable, quaint, humorous, philosophical, pathetic, charming, glorious Ik. Marvel!
               It is as refreshing to the mind, wearied with the thrice-told insipidities of
               continental travel to dip into his fresh sparkling pages, as a plunge, this hot
               weather, into the cold, diamond, deer-haunted waters of some mountain lake. We have
               turned over his soft, thick, dainty pages, and our eye has glided along the stream of
               his bright descriptions, pleasant thoughts, humorous expressions, and characters
               painted with a few light touches, like daguerreotype portraits—very Sterne-like and
               exceedingly fine—until arriving at the end we are startled at the rapidity with which
               the feet of Time, flower-muffled, have trodden.—<title>Albany Atlas.</title>

            <p>A series of the liveliest, newest, most taking and most graphic sketches of out of

            </p>
            <p>This is decidedly the most agreeable book of the season. It reminds one by an
               occasional association of ideas, rather than resemblance, of imitation of Sterne's
               Sentimental Journey, and some of Longfellow's Transatlantic Sketches; but its
               freshness, its variety, graphic descriptive power, and genial sympathies, are all its
                  own.—<title>Buffalo Advertiser.</title>

            <p>It is a series of pictures—sketches of scenes which passed under the author's eye. It
               is most ably done, and shows the hand of one gifted with genius and destined to make

            <p>Like a talented and enthusiastic artist, he placed himself in the best positions, and
