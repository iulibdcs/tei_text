LOUIS: SOUTHWESTERN BOOK AND PUBLISHNG COMPANY, NO. 512 WASHNGTON AVENUE. 1874.    <pb n="0" xml:id="VAC6632-00000002"/> Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by  LOUISE S. HARRIS,  In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.   PREFACE. A thought of presenting to the public a book similar to that now offered, was even years ago suggested to my mind as being something especially needed among the mothers and daughters of this country. But we hesitated in consideration of the injunction, which says: ' Speak every man truth with his neighbor; " and did not feel at liberty to take even a non-conspicuous place upon the literary platform among the novel-writers of the day; and the only alternative, as the need of such work seemed still to weigh upon our mind, was to sketch incidents from actual life and weave them into character., Often quite a number of such incidents have been used with fictitious names in representing one individual char- acter, and these, by being so culled and fitted, have, been made to represent a more limited experience than actually existed.    <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6632-00000003"/> 4          PREFACE. But it is with realities we have had to do. We are inclined to think that women, far more than men, are possessed of these romiantic sentiments which are calcu- lated to destroy much of the happiness of real life. Per- haps the narrow limits of her sphere may help to foster them, as the eye being able to see so little, leaves more for the imagination to perform. But be that as it may, we do not hesitate to say that woman's happiness is often blightedby these exciting and unsatisfactory dreams. She forms an ideal without realizing that humanity, in its fallen state, can never attain to it; and when the individual or individuals whom she has graced with such imaginary perfections, falls short of them (and dlo so he surely wilD, it robs her of the bliss the present offers, and not unfrequently makes her feel that she has made a grievous mistake that can never be remedied. And it is to those who are unable to look at the practical side of life that we would lend a helping-hand. It is the sick and not the 'well who need the physician's aid; and, as the physician of bodily infirmities will permit his medi- cines to be administered in any thing that will not des- troy the supposed virtue belonging to the drug, even so we consider it to be with the Great Physician's rem- edy for spiritual ailments. If the divine truths of God's   PREFACE.          5 word are not adulterated with human falsehood, we are bound to believe there can be no blame attached to the manner of its administrationjproviding it be done with an earnest desire for the suppression of error and the good of others, and for God's glory. The same truths as presented here might have been sent forth in the form of tract or pamphlet, but these would fall into the hands of comparatively few, save those who are already estab- lished in the truth; and, as before remarked, it is the sick who need this heavenly antidote. As a literary attainment, in the publication of this work, we make no pretensions, neither do we presume to challenge the criticisms of the public; and in proof of the doctrines set forth we appeal to no other authority than God's own record.

The mad'ning tempest veil the o'erarching sky, Yet not in any nor in all be heard The 'small, still voice' that emanates from God." The sun had sunk behind the hills that cradled in the town of Linden. The busy hum of business hours was hushed, and all rested in the calm that should succeed a day of honest labor. The bell had already tolled forth its last invitation and the little chapel was crowded to its utmost capacity. For weeks the villagers had been assembling there, and the " one thing needful " had, from time to time, been pressed upon their consciences; but "that day " alone will declare how much truth fell upon ground prepared to receive it, and, consequently, brought forth fruit unto eternal life. . The ministers were loud and eloquent in their appeals, reasoning fluently upon " righte- ousness, temperance, and a judgment to come"; but the "cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches?' are ever ready to choke out the word and render it unfruitful. Many, doubtless, felt that the power of God was there, and <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6632-00000006"/>  that through His Spirit a mighty work was being carried on. How many during that evening resolved to " turn over a new leaf" and live a life of sinfulness no longer. Such is the natural tendency of the heart when it sees the evil of any course. Oh! but when the leaf is turned over it is soon soiled and blotted like the first. What then? Turn over another! But human experience can readily attest that that page, and the next, and so on through, would only share a similar fate. What then? Throw it away like a- school-boy's blurred and blotted copy book because there is no longer space for trying to improve it? Alas! too many lives are thus thrown away after un- availing efforts toward improvement are forever past. Turning a new leaf is very well when used to mend the defects of an immoral life, but when put forth to improve the carnal nature, and render it " meet for an inheritance among the saints of light," it is even worse than folly. After the principal discourse was ended, the minister descended from the pulpit, and, passing among those who seemed most deeply exercised, spoke words of com- fort or exhortation, as their varied conditions might sug- gest. But there was one of that assembly, of whom we would more particularly speak, who sat with bowed head and thoughtful mien. This was a pale, though not at all angelic-looking girl, over whose life-path more than a score of wintry winds had swept, but the bitterness of whose life-experience had far outstripped her years. Lorina Selton was well known by most of the villagers of that remote country place--was applauded by some as being one whose unexpanded talents might some day   be inscribed upon the annals of earthly fame; but none but God knew how that one burning desire, which others lightly predicted, had lighted up the unexplored depths of her inmost soul. She was only the teacher of the vii- lage school, and had struggled heroically against adverse circumstances to reach that point, while her birth was of unpretending, although perfectly unsullied parentage. But this was a hard, a thankless life; for who ever sup- poses that a teacher needs to rest I He may delve deeply into the mysterious speculations of astronomers and geol- gists, and labor to unravel the tangled knots of geometry in hopes of making the matter clear enough for the un- expanded intellect to grasp; but then he can sit down and do that, and, of course, it can not be hard work. Such are some of the unwise conclusions drawn; but as at present we do not propose to discuss the different bear- ings of mental and physical labor, we pass them by. Linden was a delightful little rural resting place-just such a retreat as one tired out with the city's dusty thor- oughfares would like to find, and it was then widely noted for its morality; and, in truth, we have sometimes thought that there was danger of its morality proving a curse in the end. Not that morality is not an excellent thing in its place-so is the air we breathe--but it will not sustain life without the addition of food to keep us. There is nothing so wholesome for society as a good, moral atmosphere to breathe, buti we do not want to try to live upon the air, nor substitute it for the " bread of eternal life." Leave everything in its proper place and all moves on harmoniously. But the moment you at-  <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6632-00000007"/> 12     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE tempt to reverse the established order of things, and take morality out of the place of worldly reform, you get every thing into a jumble, and, of course, can bring in nothing but confusion. Morality and Christianity are as adverse as i light and darkness. Each has its own peculiar place, but they can never coalesce and simmer down into one and the same identical thing. And yet this simmering process was being widely carried on throughout the vil- lage, for Linden had a fashion of being somewhat ex- cessive in her undertakings, whatever nature these under- takings might chance to assume. But as those excesses were generally of a moral nature, society did not suffer from them; but whether or no there will be suffer- ings through eternity, through a false appreciation of the real value of morality, is a subject that might be open for discussion. But to return to our tale. Lorina Selton, or Rena, as she was more familiarly known, had greedily caught the words that fell, as though they had been intended exclu- sively for herself. She had listened throughout the dis- course with a half-real, half-dreamy feeling, seemingly as far away from the actual world as ' One who treads alone some banquet hall deserted" could be from the walks and companionship of men. To her this world, with all its allurements, had proved very unsatisfying. A vague, undefined yearning for some- thing more substantial than yet found, something that the soul could lay hold upon and feel securely anchored, had at times from childhood forced itself upon her mind. It was not really a world-weary feeling, for she had no   VANQUISHED DREAM.        I3 desire to leave the world, nor even to give up the phan- tom that she had been so eagerly pursuing, but it was the voice of conscience whispering, , these things must have an end." But God's Spirit was indeed preparing her heart for the reception of the precious seed, andthis was not mere natural excitement alone, however much of human feelings might have been mingled with it. The tear of contrition and much of the' pent-up grief might be merely the fruits of fleshly feeling, but doubtless the Holy Spirit had lighted a candle, and was sweeping the dark apartments of her heart. The Good Shepherd had been looking down in pity as she strayed upon the dark mountains of sin and earthly expectation, and now all the rubbish of earthly merits must be swept away ere the precious treasure--even Christ dwelling in the heart by faith-could be found there. His eye had guided her all along life's way, but she knew him not. Now, He was seeking to reveal the love that had thus watched over her, but she still refused to believe it. The moon shed a soft radiance o'er the chapel spire that pointed so sig- nificantly toward heaven, as she left the-house, but a shadow was still hovering above her soul. No lamp was lighted when she reached her own apartment, for Rena always liked things to correspond, and darkness better ac- corded with her gloomy thoughts. She glided quietly to her rest, only to awaken again to the stern duties of the life before her. For many days she continued in this melancholy condition-sitting in "' the shadow of self- gathered clouds," as she had so often done in years gone by. A certain amount of repentance, or sorrow for sin, she felt <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6632-00000008"/> "  .   LINDEN HILL; OR, THE              was needful, but was never able to ascertain how much that was, or when she had repented enough. It was nothing less than a kind of penance, this ever tearing  open the heart-wounds afresh, vainly hoping that its bleeding throes would help to atone for a life of wilful- ness and sin. A wire garment, or chastisement of self- inflicted stripes would have amounted to just the same; for it is not by our tears or heart-pangs, but by "His stripes that we are healed." But human nature is weak at best, and, of course, when so fully exercised it can but impede a dione work in the soul. The over-taxed nerves must eventually relax, and when this does take place, a quiet, self-subdued feeling will at last take pos- session of one's being. And it was even so with Rena Selton, as near the termination of the protracted meet- ings when the congregation arose, singing that beautiful hymn, "Arise! my soul, arise! Shake off thy guilty fears; The bleeding sacrifice In thy behalf appears," her spirit, for the time, seemed to rise above the murky clouds that darkened her mental sky, and she ventured to indulge a faint "hope" that she was born of God. Hope! O the treachery contained in that one little word! What promises it makes that are doomed to disappointment! What emotions it often awakens that are destined to be hushed only in the sleep of a dark despair! ' I am hoping to see a much-loved friend soon, and my heart palpitates wildly with anticipated pleasure. ; j   VANQUISHED DREAM.        1 But a telegram is dropped into my hand, and I learn that a steamboat disaster or a railroad collision has occurred, and my friend will never come! I have long hoped to see my child grow up to fill a position earned by virtuous and upright manhood; but, alas! I see him as a drunken debauchee, staggering heedlessly onward, until at length he topples over into a drunkard's grave 1 Such are some of the living realities that ascend from the grave of a buried hope. Then, if so fickle and unstable in regard to things here below, is it a-suitable prop upon which to lean for eternity? Can the soul stake every- thing upon such a die, which if lost is lost forever? Ah! such is but blind delusion! Hope is but the shadow of a substance, and in itself is absolutely nothing. It is "faith that is the substance of things haped for, the evi- dence of things not seen." Do I hope that I am saved? But why do I hope so? Is it because I have seen some- thing in my heart that would indicate a change there? Then I am trusting in what is seen, and faith/ is " the evi- dence of things not seen." Perhaps I may refuse to ven- ture further than this trembling hope, and even arro- gate to myself some praise for being thus humble. But it is pride, bearing the false title of humility, that I am thus parading! If I am really humble, I will accept of and rejoice in the gift bestowed upon me, no matter that I was not worthy to receive it. Paul never hoped that there was " a building of God, a house not made with hands," in reserve for him, nor that a " crown of righteousness was laid up in heaven " as his reward. He knew it was there, for God, by his <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6632-00000009"/> I6     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE word, had declared it. And the Apostle James "1 wrote these things that we might know that we had eternal life," and not stand trembling upon the sands of a perish- able hope. When Christ himself is presented as " our hope," it would unquestionably imply a bodily substance; and being thus used to designate the Son of God, we then would 1" be saved by hope," for we are saved by him. ," I don't see clearly as I'd wish to," was the rejoinder to the inquiries in regard to her spiritual exercises, " and I can't help feeling some hesitation in making a public profession. But then I've always had a stereotyped ex- perience marked out for myself, feeling that nothing less miraculous than Paul's conversion would ever satisfy me." "We are seldom brought through the path that we have marked out for ourselves," was answered, thought- fully. "And I think our enjoyment of religion, in such cases, is generally in proportion to our work for Christ's cause." "If I could see it in that light I should not hesitate for a moment. I feel that I have been standing idle too long already." ,( Then go and work for Christ, and may he bless and keep you in your labors," was the fervent rejoinder. And Rena Selton knew that her name was inscribed upon the books of the village chapel, but she only hoped that perchance it might be written in the Lamb's Book of Life. But she had willingly assumed the place of a hireling, and was going to work for wages, asking as a   VANQUISHED DREAM.         17 recompense for her services that God would give her the balm needful to quiet a troubled conscience. Christian service is very needful; but it is one thing to work for God and quite another to work under a sense of duty. In the former, it is the free offering of a loyal heart, while the latter is but the slavish servitude of a conscience ill at ease, and who would seek to do some- thing to recommend one to God's favor. If the heart is filled with peace it can offer to God the " sacrifice of praise continually," but if not, every effort will have self, in some form, as its end. But Rena Selton -had never once thought that she had chosen the place of the serv- ant instead of that of the son. Thus, even if she had been clothed with the garment of salvation, she had re- fused the royal favor of ring and sandals. She must needs, in spirit, wear upon her finger the golden band emblematic of her betrothal to the Royal Son. Her feet, too, must be properly shod before she could tread the spiritual courts where the Christian is privileged to roam. She had really seated herself at the servants' table after such a plain manifestation of the Father's love. It is true that there was "bread enough and to spare," for God bestows his gifts upon even the unthankful; but if she worked to procure it there could be no heartfelt thankfulness for the possession of it. Did she in her heart thank her employers for the wages which her toil some life had gleaned? By no means. It was her own labor that had procured it, and all thanks were seemingly due to herself alone. But was she happy in the portion she had chosen?    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6632-00000010"/> 18     LI NDEN HILL; OR, THE Even the servant may be happy in a certain sense when he thinks of all the comforts his labor may procure; but he is not rejoicing in the consciousness of a love that, "without money and without price," will freely supply him with all things needful. And it was even in this sense that Rena felt a degree of happiness, as she thought of her mother's deep anxiety for the eternal welfare of her children, and felt assured of the joy it would give her father's heart to know that she had openly professed to be a follower of Jesus. Yet this was only joy at the prospective peace others might reap from her earnest efforts. It was still the servant's place, and she was not "rejoicing in the Lord," for she had not yet been able to appreciate his love. The following Lord's Day morning dawned calm and cloudless. Was it emblematic of her future peace? On that day she was to attend to the ordinance of baptism- that privilege the Christian is permitted to enjoy, but which she had brought along wrapped up in the chilling mantle of duty. A calm, almost like restraint, rested out- wardly upon the village, unbroken by the mechanic's hammer or the schoolboy's shout.  Perhaps one's thoughts in regard to the general sanctity of the day might have been somewhat diminished had he been per- mitted to peep behind the curtain where Tom Doyle was so busily engaged finishing the perusal of the latest dime novel, notwithstanding that he had retired there on pur- pose to look over his Sunday School lesson. But then that was not so much worse than Tim Milbourne, his next door neighbor, who was so busily occupied just then   VANQUISHED DREAM.        19 in polishing off those dainty little boots of his-for Jim pridedlhimself a great deal on his delicate, lady-like foot. But he had forgotten to attend to this little affair, or rather had neglected it, having been out with his par- ticular friend, Dick Ramsey, at the club. And poor Dick, too, was compelled to violate the day in trying to conceal the sandy hue of his lately turned-out mous- tache with a darker and more becoming dye. "O dear," said pretty Jennie Leland, with a yawn, "I'm so tired! I wish Sunday never came, or that I might be permitted to sleep it away itf it is so very needful." "Why, Jennie, how very wickedly you talk!" ejacu- lated Miss Smith, pursing up her thin lips and elevating her eyebrows in astonishment at the girl's irreverence. "Don't you know that this is the Sabbath, and that God has commanded us to keep it holy?" "Yes, I know they tell me that," she responded, with the same look of graceful indifference. "And I've read two whole chapters, 'filled with jaw-breaking names, this morning, just because mother told me she would buy me a nice dress if I'd read the Bible through, but I couldn't now tell one thing I have read about. It's awful dull to me." "Perhaps you were thinking of something else," inter- posed Mr. Purcell, with a smile, " and that accounts for your being so absent-minded while reading your Bible lesson." "And how am I to help it?" asked the girl, in an art-    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6632-00000011"/> 20     LINDErV H ILL; OR, THE less manner. "My thoughts will run after the week's amusements in spite of me." "Can't you control yourself?" he asked, laughing. "Not any easier than I can be controlled myselt," re- sponded the willful sprite; "and Miss Selton thinks I'm almost uncontrollable." She threw herself upon the sofa in a careless, " don't- care-a-cent" manner, and could do nothing less than wish for a speedier flight of time. "I don't see any sense in being so strict anyhow," she continued. "I can't see what harm there is in indulging in some harmless little game on Sunday, when it is ac- knowledged harmless on the week days." "Because," responded Mr. Purcell, pleasantly, "' this is God's day and not ours, and he has told us to ' keep it holy,' and devote it to his service." "Do you keep it holy, Mr. Purcell?" she asked, with a quizzical expression. "I try to," he replied with the same good-natured smile. "And I try to keep my thoughts from running away after the things that you call vanities; but it does not signify that I do it. God never said, ' Remember the Sabbath day, and try to keep it holy.' He said to keep it so. Do you do that?" "O, perhaps not all of the day," he answered, without appearing the least disconcerted by her impudence; " but then I do the best I can, and that proves my intentions are good at least." "But they tell me that if you 'keep the whole law and   VA4VNQUISHED DREAM.       21 yet offend in one point you are guilty of the whole trans- gression.' So supposing that you could really keep the day all but one moment, and then happen to have a foo- ish thought, wouldn't that be a broken Sabbath? Miss Selton says that the 'thought of foolishness is sin,' and I guess she considers me the wickedest girl in Linden,' for she says I never talk anything but nonsense." "I'm afraid you're a naughty little girl, and don't know what you talk about. But you must remember that even youth does not license you to run into world- liness and pleasure, and break the holy Sabbath day." "I don't believe that any one can keep it," she remarked in a more serious manner than it was common for her to manifest. "And even if they could, it would look like an insult to give the devil six days so willingly, and then ty to give one to God, as so many do." "It's better to give God one day than none at all; isn't it?" "That may be, if it was really done," was the reply. "But there is so much constraint about it, so much that seems to be put on; and I'm sure if it was a divine zeal kindled in the heart, it would shine upon the face and actions during the week, and not disappear with Mon- day morning's sunrise. It all seems so unmeaning, and what there is about Sunday to enjoy, except the putting on of one's good clothes, I never could see. I have a horrid recollectidn of the day at one particular time, when I went with mother to one of their big basket-meetings. Two or three long, unmeaning sermons were preached, with scarcely any intermission, and I, of course, was com-    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6632-00000012"/> 22     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE pelled to stay and be edified with it all. If I could have inhaled a breath of outside air that did not seem under restraint, the day would not have been so intolerable. I shall always remember my own feelings that day, when they sung an old, familiar hymn. I don't remember how it begins, but it tells how they all longed to go from here to the better place, ' Where congregations ne'er break up, And Sabbaths never end.' You need not laugh, for the impression I had drawn was was really dreadful. I thought if that was the real pic- ture of their destined heaven, I should prefer that of the Persians, composed of beautiful flowers, singing birds, and flowing fountains." "I'm afraid you're rather beside yourself to-day, and don't know what you're talking about," responded her companion playfully. "I think, perhaps, Dick Ramsey occupies a more prominent place in your thoughts than Sunday or anything else." A momentary blush suffused the fresh, young cheek as that name was mentioned; but, perhaps, it would have been the same had any one else been spoken of. "But mercy, it's time that I was beginning to dress for church. And see," she continued, touching the curl- ing papers that stood out here and there about her head without the least systematical arrangement, and still looked decidedly becoming notwithstanding their disor- der, ' I intend to look particularly fascinating to-day;   VAVNQUISHED DREAM.       23' that's what I go for." And away she glided to prepare for her triumph. But Rena Selton was unconscious of all this colloquy, as she sat at the window of her boarding-house looking out upon the blue sky and lurid sunlight. The grim winter had not entirely passed away, and the air was sharp, though bracing,.while patches of snow were visible here and there which had still refused to give up the prerogative of winter. She, too, had been occupied with thoughts of the Sabbath's sacred solemnity, but it was a legal Sabbath that she was striving thus to honor. A legal Sabbath! Was there ever a Sabbath which was not a legal one? Of course not. The Sabbath was a part of the Law, and as such was as fully under the shadow of legality as were the burnt-offerings and sacri- fices. But did not God rest upon the seventh day from all his works long before the Law was given? Most assuredly he did. And why should he not have rested? It was all " good, and very good," for man had not yet brought in sin and ruin as he has in all things. God could rest in his finished work, because it was not only perfect, but sinless. But the Savior's life upon earth was not one of rest, but of faithful labor. God cannot rest in that which is marred by sin. But he did not designate this first rest as a Sabbath, but only as his individual rest in a spotless creation. It was not until the Israelites were re- deemed and brought out of, Egyptian bondage that a Sabbath was instituted. Thus we see that it was to a redeemed people alone that God gave a Sabbath. And, "therefore," He says, in consequence of having re-    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6632-00000013"/> 24     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE deemed them and brought them out of the land of bond- age, "I give unto them my Sabbath." And this Sab- bath was only a type--the shadow of a coming body, as were the feasts and holy days. It was not the substance itself, but only something with which they were to be occupied as a reminder until that substance came. In the eleventh chapter of Collossians the Apostle says: "Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink, or in respect to a holy day, or of the new moons, or of the Sabbath days, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ." It was to remain as a shadowy type until the coming Body dispersed the shades of Old Testament darkness, ushering in a new and brighter dis- pensation. It was a part of the law, and "Christ was the end of the law "-a faint picture of the rest that the weary and heavy-laden sinner was to find in Him. This is not the " rest that remaineth for the people of God," but merely a foretaste of that glorious rest-a resting in Him even now.  But that shadowy, sabbatical type passed forever away over the sepulchre of Jesus as He lay there upon that. memorable day; a part of His mightiest work was performed upon that day, though sealed and guarded in the silent tomb; and it was not until the "Sabbath was fully past-" showing that the old dispensation was at an end-that He rose as con- queror. Can we venerate the Sabbath now, or say that the last day of the week has been supplanted by the first? God never changed it. The Sabbath has only passed away like darkness before the rising sun. The Jews, though " scattered and peeled " as a nation, may yet with   VANQUISHED DREAM.        25 consistency appreciate that day. The veil of unbelief still clouds their mental vision, and the Lord's day to them must bear the semblance of fanatical dreamings. But shall the Christian grope amidst its shadows when a brighter and more glorious light has burst upon the world? And shall we do away with the Sabbath then? God has already done that. And shall we go on in sin and worldliness without even one day to check the un- controlled passions of men? When the Sabbath' had fully and forever passed away then the first day of the week dawned upon the world, but it did not come freighted with legal duties, for a day of grace was then ushered in. God's redeemed ones are privileged to ob- serve and meet upon this day, but there is no law with direful threats suspended over it. As a thing of worldly observance, one day of rest is not ohly well enough, but absolutely beneficial; and as a moral institution it holds in check the darker and more avaricious passions of the soul; and to the Jlaboring and oppressed proves a little oasis along life's barren journey. But this we do say, that those who have not bowed to the name of Jesus can never honor him by the observance of this day. And if the Sabbath in its shadowy form was so zealously guarded that even death was the penalty for breaking it, what ought it to be for those who dishonor God's perfect rest in Christ? This is the real Sabbath, of which the former was but the shadow. God again rests in this-Christ's perfect work-having proved it by raising him from the dead. And must man try to add some of the beggarly sticks of his own good work to complete it? 2    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6632-00000014"/> 26     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "It is all so dark and unreal," murmured Rena, as she turned away from the window with a sigh. "I would almost give anything if I could enter into the depths of these wondrous truths." And it is not so much wonder that she was thus blinded. She was ever seeking to delve into the hidden mysteries of God's word, but was only throwing the rub- bish of human speculations upon the plain and simple truths before her. Why not take that which is upper- most-first, and not perplex the brain with idle specula- tions? True, God's word is an unexplored mine, but it is the Spirit alone that can reveal its hidden treasures to our understandings. "( What if this is all delusion after all," she mentally ex- claimed, " a delusion from which I may never wake in this world?"But a rap at the door tangled the thread of her fruitless dreamings. "There is a gentleman below who wishes to see you, Miss Selton," said a soft, sweet voice. "I will be there in a moment," was the response, and the light form glided away. Was there a shadow of coming sorrow hovering over her soul, as with a stifled sigh she turned to the mirror to brush down the refractory hairs among her tresses? 'Tis only for the superstitious that coming events casts forward a warning shadow. She was somewhat paler than usual as she passed out to obey the summons, but no intimation of the terrible blow impend- ing had so much as flitted across her mind. A low, stifled cry escaped her lips as she turned away from the   VA4NQUISHED DPEAM.        27 messenger, and, burying her face in her hands, she sank upon a chair in an agony of speechless grief. "Your mother is dead/" were the only words spoken, but these were enough to strike out every gleam of sunlight from her lonely heart and life. CHAPTER II. CHLDHOOD. "A mother's love! If earth holds one thing pure, When all beside is sullied, That can endure When all else pass away; If there be aught Surpassing human deed, or word, or thought, It is a mother's love." Let us, go back to a quiet, unpretending spot, una- dorned except as nature had surrounded it with her charms, where Rena Selton first opened her eyes upon this unsatisfying world. A small farm house adjoining a wide- strip of woodland is the most noticeable feature where, in childish freedom, she used to wander among the cool shadows, or, sitting upon the moss-grown rocks, weave magnificent dreams of a future that she had des- tined to be illustrious. Alas! how fragile are human ex- pectations; and yet, in her case, the realities far out- shone her brightest dream, but not in earthly fame or greatness! But little outward appearance of romance    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6632-00000015"/> 28     LINDEN HILL , OR, THE was visible through those passing years, but there was visible, to the eye of the Infinite, ever-changing emotions, as from the lofty summits of sublimity her thoughts de- scended into the gloomy valleys of disappointment and unfulfilled hopes. To her the lauded joys of childhood were a meaningless tale, and she went on through years that should have been exempt from care, feeding the devastating flame of human ambition with hopeful dreams. She was unwittingly burning up the fuel-that after years would need to run the mysterious machine of human life, while the seasons carhe and went, the spring flowers faded to give place to the golden fruits of autumn, and anon the cold blasts of winter swept away all traces of the summer's glow; and still she plodded on in her uneventful life, ever pluming the wings of her im- agination for loftier flights, but ever hoarding the golden visions in the secret council chambers of her own heart. Rena Selton was reaching after a loftier sphere-a region beyond the humdrum cares of a peasant's life, vainly imagining that happiness came hand in hand with worldly wealth or distinction. How little she then knew how unsubstantial the promises of this world are! How, like the mirage of the desert, they delude the- thirsty soul along, but ever elude his grasp while they dance in refreshing loveliness before him. How long it takes to learn that a contented, uncomplaining compliance with God's will, in whatsoever sphere of life we may have to walk, is the golden key that un- locks the store-house of all earthly happiness. But shte was not conning over this prosaic lesson, but reading   VANQUISHED DREAM.,        29 from the gilded pages of imagination a poem which was much sweeter to the taste and more delightful to rumi- nate upon. Her little earnings, by means of hard labor, had, from year to year, been hoarded away with miserly care, until they had grown into quite a consideration, and she at length began to feel that the time had come for her to take her flight from the home nest. "Rena, you have no right to speak- so," her mother gently ex- postulated, as the cherished plan of her life was being talked over, and the father's disapprobation of such pro- ceedings fully made known. "Your father's judgment may be somewhat at fault, but such bitterness toward a parent's authority is by no means becoming." "Well, I guess I can do as I please some day," she replied, in a tone of seeming defiance, but a tear was visible in her eye as she spoke. "'Tis nothing but old fogyism that makes him so, set in his way anyhow." "Rena, my dear child, I am sorry to hear you speak so," Mrs. Selton answered, while the tears filled her own eyes. cc You know that I would be glad if he would allow you to go, but he does not consider it best, and this disrespectful way of speaking of your father is very undutiful." "I wonder if he thinks I must always live this hum- drum sort of life just because he did?"She again re- torted with increasing warmth;  "He must think I'm exceedingly wise if I don't need any more cultivation than I can get through these rustic pedagogues! - The truth is, mother, I want to be educated, polished and accomplished-in fact, to be something and somebody in '   .    .   .^    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6632-00000016"/> 30     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE the world!"A glow of enthusiasm tinged her pale face as she uttered these words, for such thoughts, though so deeply graven upon her heart, had never before been. so freely expressed to any living soul. "I want to be some- thing that the world will be compelled to look up to and honor, and not a mere zero in the great sum of life. It may appear weak to you, mother," she continued, while the raging fires of ambition within gave a new light to her eye and a glow to her pale cheek. "But I would sacrifice everything for a name. I have had this one dream as long as I can remember, and I should not shrink from a garret and pallet of straw with the hope that some day I might burst forth a 'bright particu- lar star' in the literary firmament. I hate the world's patronage; I don't want it to pity me, but to look up to me." There was a pause for a few moments, as, over- come with her own extravagant views, she seemed to look far away into the future. Again resuming the subject she said, "You know what a life of drudgery mine has been, mother; it has all been on the rough, shadowy side of life, while many, no more deserving than myself, have had only a smooth, sunshiny way. But I wouldn't mind that now if I knew that it was' all in the past-in fact, if the hardships of the past had left my heart as well as my hands bruised or bleeding. I would rejoice that it was so could it only secure for ime the position in future that my heart is bent upon obtaining." The mother's heart was deeply touched, for there throbbed a true mother's heart in that fragile bosom; but she had learned that to appeal from her husband's decision   VAVNQUISrED DREAM.        31 was in vain, therefore, she could only lift her heart to Him whose pity never fails, and try, in her own gentle way, to soothe the troubled mind of her desponding child. Perhaps she could look back upon her own life and review some unfulfilled dream, some hope cherished when amid the homely surroundings of domestic life she had written snatches of poetry, keeping them zealously concealed lest her sensitive nature should be wounded by the harsh criticisms of her companions. We say per- r haps so, for what life has not its unwritten romance: but if so, those hopes have long since withered; those cherished dreams, without hope of resurrection beauty, have been buried in the darkened recesses of her own soul! "I am sorry, my dear, that home has so little in com- mon with your feelings," she remarked, pensively, as if seeking to arouse some holier feeling in the mind of her unhappy child. "To ome it could not be happier if you were only content here, but your happiness is of far greater importance to me than my own." Rena's selfish heart was deeply touched. She re- membered the weary years of her gentle mother's un- complaining life, of her many self-denials and privations for her children's sake, even when her feeble step and pallid cheek might have justified her in claiming the many attentions due the invalid. She knew that it was not compulsion that made her life one of toil or priva- tion, but the heart of the true wife and mother ever causes a forgetfulness of self in seeking to relieve the real or imaginary cares of others. Her affections clung    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6632-00000017"/> "NDE  HZLL; OR, THE  with a vine-like trust around her husband's more rug- ged nature, and he, although of strong, unyielding will, ever maintained a watchful tenderness over her. Firm in his own opinions, he was not easily induced to yield to any, but since the years of early manhood, when, as a youthful pioneer, he came among the frontier wilds and reared for himself an humble habitation, she, who had. consented to be the light of his wildwood cabin, had ever since been the magnet of all his earthly dreams of hap- piness. To him home without the inspiration of her voice and gentle smile would have been but a desert waste. And yet her yielding, child-like nature had only augmented the firmness of his own will, and he did not pause to consider that there were infant plants growing up in their connubial bower whose dispositions portrayed more .of the father's unbroken firmness than of the mother's self-forgetting tenderness. Thus Rena, although she had a heart that could feel for others, had an unbroken will. The storms of oppo- sition might sweep over her, and for the time crush down all words of resentment, yet the will was elastic and would rise up again in spite of all opposing circumstances. The self-forgetting love of her mother at this time, however, subdued her turbulent spirits, and resting her head upon that bosom which had so often pillowed it in times of childish trouble, through the years gone by, she articulated between her sobs, " I don't feel hurt with you, mother; I know that it is not your fault, and I'll try to be content until I can do as I please. It is not because I'm tired of being with you, but you know that   VANQUISHED DREAM..              33 I shall have my own living to make, and I should like to be qualified for a position where I could earn a live- lihood and yet not be looked upon as something unfit for respectable society." But this apology, although offered in the utmost kind- ness, was the most affecting appeal to her mother's heart that could have been given. Her pride and love were both by this called into question-pride, that a child in whom her partial eyes could see so much that was both great and beautiful should be doomed to walk in a sphere in which her feelings had nothing in common; and love for one so fragile, who would, perhaps, be com- pelled to bear the burden and heat of life's drudgery, when, by proper culture, she might be lifted to a position above it. How little did either of them realize that. although the "lot is cast into the lap," there is an over- ruling power in disposing of it at last. Rena had no matrimonial dreams in view, and the love of one indi- vidual heart, however sincere it might be, was a thing of trifling import. The homage of the many seemed a treasure as much more to be desired than love as the swelling cataract is more grand and loud than the gush- ing waters from some lonely desert spring. She did not know that as the weary traveler who quenches his thirst at the quiet fountain sits down refreshed and thankful, while he who gazes upon the cataract goes away seeking something more sublime upon which to feast his vision; even so, he who is content with the sweet retirement of domestic life is drinking in a happi- ness of which the devotees of earthly fame have never    <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6632-00000018"/> 34      LINDEN HILL; OR, THE known I She had been a close observer of the jar -and discords of domestic life in general, had narrowly watched all the petty gallantries and simpering pleasantries of those who were lovers, and contrasted them with the slipshod carelessness and unadorned rudeness of too many instances of wedded life. Then is it any wonder that she had no thought of ever obtaining a brighter life through matrimonial entanglements, however much she might enjoy the society of the rustic beaux. It is very pleasant to be flattered and waited upon-a little sweet- ness in the bitter cup of life; but in observation, as well as reality, she had stood behind the laborious scenes of domestic drudgery, had seen the " dirty ropes" which shift the various scenes, and been fully convinced that pulling those ropes was no idle play for the delicate hand. In fact, she looked upon men as tyrants and their wives but little better than slaves, and had resolved that she, at least, would live without their assistance and above the slavery'their lordships invariably imposed. She longed to widen the narrow limits of woman's sphere, to lift her to the place she should occupy, even to be man's equal! And as she looked out upon the great masses of struggling humanity, imagination beheld wo- man bound down with these fetters which, to so many, seemed so grievous to be borne, her heart revolted against the holiest institution God has ever made. How little it is realized outside as well as inside the pale of Christianity, that individual lives, as epistles, are read by those with whom one is thrown in contact; and it is not at all strange that the harassing experience of a teacher's   VANQUISHED DREAM.        35 life should tend to foster these sentiments, for, as before remarked, who that has tried that life does not know something of its trials. After having to deal with men of narrow, sordid views, her heart prompted her to ex- claim, "And these are the lords of creation! I verily believe if some man were to employ a woman to plow or make rails he would only pay her halfprice, because forsooth she is only a woman." Being a woman was a re- proach as well as misfortune, to say nothing more-a trace of the heathenism of darker lands. What wonder then that the aspiring girl looked with distrust and con- tempt upon her rightful protectors, longing for a brighter era in the history of nations to be ushered in, when wo- man should occupy her rightful place, the equal as well as companion of man. And had some sister-hand erected a standard for " woman's rights " how joyfully would she have responded to the rallying shout. Her wayward heart did not permit her to see that woman never has and never will gain any rights, socially, by such proceed- ings. God's word alone gives her her true place, and there it gives her no prominent one, but simply shelters by a love that, when walking in the true light, makes her one with himself and shields her, as far as this life can be, from the bitter blasts of earthly cares.    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6632-00000019"/> 36      LINDEN HILL; OR, THE CHAPTER    III.

"And so you're going away," remarked Nellie Clyde, as she bustled about through the old farm house helping Rena about the work; for Nelhe had a knack of know. ing where everything belonged, and just where it should be put away.

"Yes, I'll get it for you in a, moment," was the reply as she briskly went on with her work.'

"' Just because she don't know what is best, then. But I'll match her. I intend to captivate Ralph Wynne this winter, just as sure as shooting." "And do you suppose I care?" asked Rena, as she placed a dish upon the table. "But you will care when you see how devoted he is to me.

"Could you bear to have the ghost of a dead wife con- tinually coming up between your husband and yourself." "I don't take much stock in ghosts, but as long as she'd not take a bodily substance and elbow me out of the way, I'd not worry much. You see by the time men lose a wife or two they begin to appreciate women and get more loving, and I want to come in when that appreciation is strongest." "And then if you were gone I suppose that some one else would come in for a greater share of appreciation yet. Nellie, would you value such a love as that?" "What would I care if I were dead," she answered lightly. "He might love as deeply as he pleased for all I'd care."   VANQUISHED DREAM.        39 "Well, you're a singular being," was the reply. "But I'm sure that I ;arouldn't give a row of pins for such a love." "And what sort of adoration would your wonderful self exact?" was queried. "Something, of course, that was changeless and eternal, though." '"I would exact a love that was first, last and only. I could not endure to be a second love, and still worse yet to have another loved after me. Nothing inferior would satisfy my nature." Her eye by chance met the earnest gaze of Philip Howard as she uttered these words, with a look so full of unspoken meaning, which he instantly withdrew and only smiled, as Nellie did at her extrava- gant expectations. "And you are a perfect goose--just what you are," was the reply. "You'll never find such a love as that if you live to the age of Methusaleh. It's only one of the romantic notions that lodged in your shallow brain. One need not wonder at anything you say." "I didn't say that I ever expected to find such," responded Rena, " but that nothing short of such would reach my standard of real love. I have no doubt that my picture is too highly colored for realization, and, to be honest, I don't believe there is such a thing as real love on earth." If she had caught the momentary glance that again'rested on her face it might have somewhat changed her views, but Phil took good care that she should not, and so her convictions remained the same.

"Ah! is that so? well one has to live and learn."

"You will be more likely to spite your- self than me by marrying Ralph." "Ah! I understand you; that's all make-believe. But he'll give me the book this winter. Last winter," she continued, addressing Philip, "he ordered two books, very husbandly, and the first night of singing-school he walked across the floor and handed. one to Rena. Every one laughed anfd Rena got pretty mad --not at Ralph, of course, she couldn't do that, but at the ill-mannered folks for laughing. "Have you the book yet?" she asked. "I have, but I paid him for it," was answered. "It's well you did, or I'd make you giv6 it up imme- diately. But do hurry up here, Rena, I'm getting hungry as a wolf!" "I'm just going to call them," was the reply, as the last dish was placed upon the table, and in a moment more the family group was seated around the board, waiting to hear the father ask the promised blessing. A  palsied hand was placed against his brow, and with a trembling voice he besought the Father that they might ever have hearts filled with gratitude for'that and all other blessings. "You will be quite lonely then," remarked Nellie, as Bessie was making some comment upon the proposed departure. 3    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6632-00000022"/> 42     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "Not much," was the rejoinder, " for she seldom says anything unless it's to Birdie or the baby. She spends half her time of late in writing letters or snatches of poetry, that are to remain forever unheard of and unsung." "You see I generally condense my thoughts. It makes my words weighty," laughed Rena. "' Yes, weighty and far-reaching," replied the visitor. "You ought to have heard some of her high-toned opin- ions a while ago." A, O, I expect I've heard them often-she is never going to stoop to anything that's not perfection. It will doubtless appear perfect to her whether it does to others or not," remarked Mrs. Selton, divining at once the sub- ject of their conversation. "Yes, and I'll bet she gets some hump-backed, bow- legged, clod-hopper, that's perfect'in nothing but being a 'gump,"' continued Nellie in high glee, now that Mrs. Selton had joined in the conversation, for it was seldom that she ever took part in discussions of that kind. "Even in that case I would accept of nothing but perfection, I suppose," answered Rena carelessly. "But I shall never marry a farmer; their wives are always drudges. I should prefer a nobleman. "Did Mason find his filley?" asked the father, as if to exemplify the fact that people can walk through scenes and yet be far away from them in thought.

"She was taken from the court-yard fence in Linden and ridden away," was the reply. "It was rather a bold undertaking; but I guess if the thief had known the direction in which Mason lived from town he would have made his escape. As it was, he came well nigh doing so." "And so they really got him?" queried the old man,     somewhat animated by the conversation. "O yes, they brought him-back, and he seemed as jolly over it as any of the crowd'."  "I saw them go by," remarked Rena. "He was a noble looking fellow; I don't know when I have seen any one so handsome."                     j "But I suppose you would have to meet him under somewhat different circumstances to have him fill the requirements of your ideal nobleman," suggested Philip with a smile as they rose to leave the supper table.

The supper things       were soon cleared away nicely, for Nellie persisted in her  /i determination to help Bessie wash the dishes, and with such assistance as hers things could not help being soon put snugly in their places.

"You will not have many crosses to encounter," remarked Rena knowingly, as she traced out the lines in her companion's hand. a' Your love of home is not very great."

"She is doomed to many disappointments, but, perhaps, she will weather through them all and be even compara- tively happy in her older days." "Now, you don't believe one word of that," was the rejoinder, " and I'll bet you tell yourself a very different story when no one's near to hear you." "Why do you think so?" was queried. "Because you'd never tell such a story if you really believed it. It would be bad enough to contemplate when you had to realize it." "I see nothing terrible about it, I'm sure," answered Rena.

Nellie Clyde was a dear, good- natured girl, but with no higher ambitious views than being a model housekeeper, which really was a blessing for her. She had been a near neighbor from infancy, and so felt at liberty to talk just as she pleased to her companion. In fact, she talked just about as she pleased to every one, but then every one knew just how to take her. Yet she too had a dear, affectionate mother and one that Rena held in high estimation. "s Rena's only fit company for such as mother," Nellie used to say, rebukingly. "I like to see young folks be young, but when she comes to our house it's to visit mother instead of me. You ought to listen to their interesting conver- sation." But the mischievous girl had to don her bonnet and hasten home, for there was plenty of work waiting for her return; and to be engaged in a perfect " hurly- burly " of work was the very cream of her enjoyment. The days of the bright-hued autumn were passing speed- ily away. Bessie was busy drying and canning fruits, and looking after this and that in general, while Mrs. Selton looked after the little ones, and occasionally placed a stitch here and there in some neglected rent, which proved valuable help, by the way, in the great business of housekeeping. But she never forgot her accustomed reading hours, as the well-marked New Testament and Psalms and "Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress" could read- ily attest, for these, together with the almanac, came well nigh constituting Dollie Selton's library. It was   VANQUISHED DREAM.        47 not head knowledge that she was seeking thus to glean, but only such wisdom as the inward nature might feed upon and grow; yet her feeble health seemed ever to gather around her admonitory shadows, prophesying continually of a coming decease. It did not deter her from the faithful performance of the many little services which were continually bubbling up around her, but it lent a subdued sadness to her face and ways, which, per- haps, had characterized her whole life. It seemed im- possible for any despondency to lessen her usefulness or cause her to forget the cares of others. Her soothing arts were readily called into use if only to hush the broken sobs of the helpless baby, who, deprived of some coveted treasure, had no other recourse than to drop its tears upon the pillow of its little cradle-bed. But her words often sounded ominous of a coming sorrow, as in addressing any of the family she would say: "I would like for you to do this or that" with. some particular things of her individual possessions, meaning after she had passed away. "We will drive to the village this afternoon, mother ; Phil says that he will take us," remarked Rena, as she began to arrange things for the proposed jaunt. "You will want the shadow of my valuable self left behind, and of course I shall want to take your's with me." It was something she absolutely dreaded to ask for, feeling that it indicated a fear, which she dared not acknowledge even to herself, that the gates of the invisi- ble world might open and close forever upon that loved form even while she was far away. There is so much    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6632-00000025"/> 48      LINDEN HILL; OR, THE uncertainty in earthly things. Still, often these delicate forms will bend for years beneath the weight of disease or sorrow, while those more rugged and hopeful will be suddenly snapped asunder by the blasts of death. "Here, you must wear this checkered gingham; it looks just like you, and will make me feel somewhat at home when I see your picture. And see, there's Phil now at the gate." The aged couple sallied forth tremblingly to take the ride of only a few miles to the village; but this was not much less than a herculean task for them, who for so many years had found their little world in that re- tired country home. "You sit here, father, this seat is the most comfortable, and I'll help Phil to drive; " and she tucked them snugly in with as much precision as if they were babies, and she clad in the white apron of an experienced nurse. "' Don't let Rena's descriptive eloquence cause you to forget your horses, Philip," remarked Mrs. Selton, laying her hand gently upon the young man's arm. "They look so spirited and wild that it makes me tremble." "I'll be very careful," he answered, with a pleasant smile that was habitual to his handsome countenance. ,' Don't be frightened, for I can easily manage them." "Why don't you say we?" suggested Rena. "Don't you remember that I'm assistant-driver?" "All right," was the reply; " but I suppose if there is any blame attached to the carelessness of our drive you will be willing to share it with me." "Most assuredly," and she gave the horse a light tap,   VANQUISHED DREAM.        49 which only caused him to throw up his head higher and manifest a more impatient spirit. "Don't, Rena; don't you see they are frightened?" pleaded Mrs. Selton, as she nervously extended her hand to grasp the rein. But the prancing was soon measur- ably subdued by Philip's persuasive voice, and also the anxiety of the nervous mother somewhat relieved by drawing up in front of their intended stopping-place. The shadows were soon stamped upon the plates, the necessary shopping duties attended, to, and the party were ready for their homeward ride. "You'll not get home by supper-time at Mason's tor- toise pace," was Rena's rejoinder, as the old folks ex- pressed their intention of accepting the invitation to ride home in the slower carriage of a neighbor who had to pass in that direction. "Better slow than too fast," was the reply. "And you must be careful or a broken neck may be the conse- quence." Be careful! Who ever saw young people who did not consider carefulness as something that belonged to age and infirmity? It is proper enough for the old and de- crepit to be cautious, but youth has so much strength and activity that precaution is seemingly unnecessary. But if God overrules all things, what is the use of careful- ness, we may ask? Are not the hearts of all men in the hands and subject to the sovereign power of God? Most assuredly they are. But because God has infinite power shall I tempt him to my own destruction? What would we think of one whom God had endowed with    <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6632-00000026"/> 50      LINDEN HILL; OR, THE something more than mere animal instinct--even with intellectual faculties capable of understanding the prin- ciples of self-preservation-were he to fall into a river and say: "The power all belongs to God; if I am to be saved, he will save me!"It would appear ridiculous in- the extreme! That the power of the Infinite is supreme none should gainsay; but that is God's side of the question, and mine wears a very different aspect. The power to convert my child I know is all in the hands of God, but the obligation to "train him up in the way he should go " belongs to me. I may fail in the perform- ance of this, and yet God be faithful in fulfilling his own purposes; but this will not excuse my negligence nor blight the harvest that my carelessness has sown. But I thought that faith trusted in that which is invisible, and looked to God alone for succor. It does. But the gen- uineness of faith is only to be discerned by the work it produces. It is a dead faith that produces no good works. I may say, "Depart in peace, and be ye warmed and filled," while no morsel leaves my board, and no ray of warmth emanates from my glowing hearthstone to warm the chilled and hungry suppliant at my door. Is this a proof of the faith I profess? And even if God should supply those needful things through other channels, am I a co-worker with himself? The thing is utterly impos- sible. Genuine faith, although it counts upon God for all things, it nevertheless walks with him, and is a co- worker in all his plans and purposes. Anything short of this is spurious, and its works will eventually prove the reality of its nature.   VANQUISHED DREAM.        5I But Rena and her companion positively intended to be cautious as they whirled speedily away. It was not their intention to disobey, but somehow they soon forgot their promise in their exhilarating drive. The spirited horses sped swiftly onward, gaining greater speed as the distance from their starting-point increased. "I think you had better hold them up a little, Phil," suggested Rena. "They seem unnecessarily impatient to enjoy the sport." But it was too late, for Phil had already been trying to arrest their impetuous speed, and without success. The momentary obstacles that alone impeded their speed were one by one left behind, and still they hurried onward. "Mercy, Phil, they'll run against that boy!" ejaculated Rena, now really awake to their danger, and blanched with'terror, as a great, awkward boy, mounted upon an old, blind horse, jogged leisurely across the highway. A low cry escaped her lips as the predicted collision was actually realized, but just at that moment a strong arm held the reins of the now really frightened animals, and with Philip's help, and a little smashing up of things in general, the horses were soon brought to a halt, and they to a realization of their danger. The boy, if not half blind himself, was surely incapable of comprehending the danger to which he was, exposed, for he never so much as halted, but jogged indifferently onward. He might, perchance, have been riding on time, and, therefore, wished to reach the destined place at the appointed moment.

"I wonder if the simpleton was hurt,", remarked Philip, as, with broken vehicle, though bandaged securely, they made another move forward, but in a less enthusi- astic manner. "' I'm sure I don't care much," was the reply. "If it had killed him, he would not have much to answer for, and such a simpleton isn't fit to live." "And haven't we played havoc in this mad drive?" continued the young man, again resuming a smile. "I believe you agreed to share the blame of disaster as well as the honor of the occasion." "You may say I, if you wish, Phil; it's of but little consequence, so I shan't quarrel with you about it." -  3;)   VA NQUISHED DREAM.       53 CHAPTER IV. THROTH-PLIGHTS. ' They know not my heart who believe there can be One stain of this earth in my feelings for thee." The moon shown brightly above the broad strip of woodland that skirted the old Selton farm, and the warm breath of autumn stirred but gently the leaves of the massive locust tree that shaded the humble doorway. It pictured to the eye of imagination a home of quiet con- tentment and unpretending happiness, and truly there was no reason why such should not have been the case. Nature, even in her blighted state, will ever wear more or less of loveliness for the appreciative eye, and surely she had not spared her charms in this place where the hand of art had been so deficient. The whippoorwill piped forth his unwelcome note as he plumed his wings upon a marble shaft, just down the hillside, in the lonely graveyard, but beyond this all was hushed, save as the belated farmer might chance to wend his homeward way along the dusty highway. But even in this quiet scene all was not lulled to rest in the arms of slumber. Where the heavy shadows fell upon a rustic seat near the old threshold sat Rena Selton, listlessly watching the fleecy clouds chasing each other across the blue firmament and ever and anon casting a shadow upon the earth as they    <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6632-00000028"/> 54     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE concealed the face of a full September moon. Her head rested, as if unconsciously, against the old moss-grown wall, while her hand idly toyed the ivy that grew in clustering wreaths above her head. "Wiy, I thought you had gone to the village, Phil," she articulated, suddenly banishing the bright dreams that for the past hour had held undisputed possession of her soul. "No, I thought I wouldn't go to-night," he answered, taking a seat beside her; "I shall have nights enough to go there when it will be lonely here in the future. But what are you dreaming about out here in this lovely moonlight?" "Isn't it lovely, though?" she asked, in an animated tone, as if she had but just discovered the evening's loveliness. "That is not what I asked you," he remarked, with a smile; " but perhaps it is well that I recalled you to con- sciousness or the beauty of the evening would doubtless have all been lost to you." "Then I suppose I should thank you for your kind- ness," she answered, but as to what I was thinking about it would take a wonderful memory to recall it." Philip Howard sat gazing far away across the moonlit scenes beyond. He, too, was young in years, but more than ordinarily matured in feeling, and it was now his hour for dreaming. "Ha! a penny for your thoughts, Mr. Phil," she ral- lied laughingly. "Don't condemn others for crimes you are guilty of yourself."   VANQUISHED DREAM.        55 " I did not mean to condemn you for what I know too well is a delightful pastime," was the quiet rejoinder; "but shall I tell you what my thoughts were?" he asked, while his dark eyes looked down into her face with unuttered tenderness. "I was just thinking how lonely this old place would be to me when you are gone, Rena," he went on to say, as her lips as well as down- cast eyes refused to answer; " even to night it seems as if coming, loneliness ( casts its shadow before.'" "Fie! such sentimentalism!" she answered gayly. "Why need you borrow some of mother's fancies. I never could see that my presence would go very far in brightening any place, much less such a dull, unromantic place as this." "Do you call this a dull place?" he asked earnestly. "To me it has for the past summer been the brightest spot this world contains." A light laugh was her only rejoinder, and yet her eyes did not dare to meet those she knew were seeking hers with such depth of meaning. Thus far no word of love had ever been spoken between them, and yet they must have understood one another, for there is a language of the eye revealing truths which the most eloquent lips often fail to utter. Yet this was no lovers' tryst which they were wont to hold, but their lives for many years, through family relationships, had been thrown together and they had drifted along in the same channel, sharing each other's troubles and pleasures until a feeling deeper than that of common   friendship had Sprung up all unper- ceived into their hearts. It would have been a humil-    <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6632-00000029"/> 56      LINDEN HILL; OR, THE iating thing had she acknowledged this even to herself, for one who condemned the many for the failures of the few. But ambition banished the very thought of such follies, and bade her class such sentiments among the weaknesses of human nature, above which the aspirant must ever seek to rise. This rustic seat was a favorite family resort when the day's labors and cares were ended, but the older members of the household, seeing less charm in the mystic moonbeams than the solid real- ities of refreshing slumber, had sought the solitude of their respective apartments, and they were left alone. But as we have been so impolite as not to give him a formal introduction to our readers we will merely say that Philip Howard was the brother-in-law of Bessie, a married daughter who had recently become a resident at Jacob Selton's old farm house, and Rena was going away to try her fortune in the outside world, for although she had for several years taught the district school with success, she was reaching after greater mental attain- ments and a wider field of action. "No," she at length murmured, more as if talking to herself than to any one else, while the gay look of trifling or indifference had all faded from her face. "I do not now look at this place as being dull like I once thought it, and if there is such a thing as. consecrated ground on earth aside from the foot-prints of the Savior, this, in my estimation, would be the spot." "Why, then, could you not be content to remain here, Rena?" he asked earnestly. "I don't believe you will find a brighter place."   VANQUISHED LIT E-DREAM.      57 "You know that I could call this home but for a few years at most, Phil; father and mother are growing old, and when they are gone there are others who have as much claim here as myself. If I mope here until the vigor of youth is gone and then have to make a dash into  the world, what promises can it offer?  And, besides all this," she went on, "there is some influence that draws me away-sometimes it almost prompts me to believe in spiritualism. I don't know whether it is an evil or good influence, but I have determined to obey and make my- self somebody in this world." "Why are you not willing to be considered somebody here?" he queried, tenderly, at the same time tak- ing her hand in his, although it trembled visibly in his clasp. "Look at the love that is lavished upon you here; why are you not satisfied with the homage of this little world?" "I know that my mother is almost idolatrous in her love for me," she remarked, evasively, and gradually going back into the same indifferent mood;" but then I shall only be gone for a year at one time, and, besides, she will hear from me so often in the meantime." "And may I not hope to hear from you sometimes?" he asked, plucking a sprig from the green clusters and binding it in her chestnut hair. "You! Why of course, if you stay here long you can't help hearing from me, for mother will be sure to tell all the nonsense I happen to write." "Why do you trifle with me, Rena? " he asked, some- what bitterly. "You know my meaning better than you 4    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6632-00000030"/> 58     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE pretend," and gently raising her face until her eyes met his own, he continued: "I'm going to tell you some- thing more than I ever have, even though it is but throw- ing my words away. I love you!"The words were f  spoken under the impulse of a boyish passion, which had it been tempered by the wisdom of after years would have doubtless been for the present left unsaid. It was not yet the suited time, and such a confession was at that time an immature one. The fashion of his after- life and fortune were yet to be chiseled out by his own exertions, and many a tiresome day must pass ere he could expect to reach the climax of his own ambitious hopes. "I know you think that such a love as you could accept could never have its birth among the low- lier walks of life," he continued. "But, Rena, I believe that my love is as deathless as eternity itself! I know it would be wrong, and yet I feel that if you were right- fully claimed by another I could never cease to love -you." Her heart beat wildly, although it was only what she might have long suspected; but rallying at length she laughingly rejoined, "Nonsense, Phil; we are but chil- dren yet; you'll get over this the first pretty face you see after I am gone." "I expected you would say as much," was the quiet response, " and I've no way of proving to you that this is no mere boyish fancy, although I am only a boy in years. Time alone will have to prove the depth of my love; but I could go on like Jacob did for any number of years if I could have but the faintest shadow of a hope to believe that my waiting was not in vain."   VANQQ UISHED LIFE DREAM.      59 Both remained silent for some time, for Philip had considerable pride, and, notwithstanding that he felt his future happiness to depend upon her decision, he was not the one who would sue for a love that was not freely given. She believed that he really loved her, and rather enjoyed the consciousness of it, as lt flattered her vanity, for there was a spice of coquetry in her nature which was hard to control. From childhood she had always liked Phil better than any one else, her mother excepted-had considered his attentions due to herself, and him equally deserving of hers. This she could readily acknowledge to her own mind; but as to love him-"Bah!"Was she weak enough to be entrapped by any man? It would do for love-sick girls, who were silly enough to believe such nonsense, to listen to and credit all such sentiments but it would never have any effect upon her. But even now it would have been difficult for her to decide whether she would be more willing to marry Phil herself or to have him marry some one else. That their lives could not always go on in this way she had never taken pains to consider, and, therefore, was illy prepared to give him a  definite answer. "Phil, I shall never get married; you know I have often told you that," she whispered, seriously. "But I'm sorry to hear you talk so, for you know that I have al- ways liked you better than any one else. He passed an arm around her waist and drew her close to himself, but said nothing. "To tell the truth," she continued, after a short silence, "this matrimonial entanglement seems to me much more like an iron chain than a silken cord any    <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6632-00000031"/> '60      LINDEN HILL; OR, THE way; men can talk smoothly enough while lovers, but -how soon they display the husband after marriage and drop all this pretty nonsense." The young man still remained silent; he had no -stronger argument to offer than his love, and was also aware that her words contained much that was too true, yet in the vigor of his young love he did not believe that 'he could ever be guilty of such base ingratitude. How little did he know of the many contending powers that beset the human heart. He had but just verged into the years of hopeful manhood, and knew not that am- bition, avarice, pride and their many associations, as well as love, in that same natural heart find a dwelling-place. The moon still beamed brightly above them and the soft breezes had not ceased to stir the leaves of the old tree that threw its grateful shadow across the doorway, but still they sat regardless of the passing hours and seemingly unconscious that rest was needful -for the morrow's labors. How blind and yet how ecstatic is love's young dream! How the sweet blossoms of the heart send up their fragrance, and the insatiate soul pauses not to think of wintry blasts or blighting frosts which may soon scatter all their perfume on life's desert air! But Rena at length awoke to the consciousness that time was speeding onward, although her rustic sim- plicity pointed out no improprieties in their harmless interview. "My goodness, Phil, it must be late!" she exclaimed, rising from the rude settee and advancing toward the door.    /   VANQUISHED L F-DREAM.       61  "Will you give me nothing to hope for in the future, Rena?--not even the faintest shadow of encouragement before you go?" he asked, arresting her steps. "If you believe what I have told you you cannot help see- ing that my life, under such circumstances, must be an aimless, cheerless one." "O fudge! Phil, don't talk so seriously about it. If it will do you any good, however, I will promise you that if I ever marry any ohne it will beyou, so don't have any fears that I will ever burden any one else with such useless property," and pushing back the brown locks from his sunburnt brow, upon which she impressed a kiss with compassionate tenderness, she flitted lightly away.

The sun never shone more brightly than upon the fol- lowing day, when Rena Selton imprinted a kiss upon her mother's care-worn cheek, and went out from under the paternal roof to battle with this cold, uncompromising world. But she cast no lingering glances back over the sunny slopes of childhood, for a brighter picture loomed up before her imagination, and her restless feet, in obedi- ence to the mind's dictations, were impatient to press forward eager for its attainment. And of what value is the bauble when once attained? An empty, worthless phantom that deludes along, often from trifles to grosser crimes. But her lesson was yet to be learned, and a merciful Providence was leading her along, although she knew it not, that she might learn the utter vanity of earthly aspirations. Philip turned away from the retreating carriage with a stifled sigh. He had awakened from that one sweet   VANOQUISHED  LIF E-DREAM.     63 summer dream, and a dark foreboding crept over him that the dream was forever ended. It was true they had parted in all kindness, and Rena had looked into his eye with a placid smile of affection a s she bade him " good- bye," but a mere act of etiquette or common friendship could not satisfy a famishing heart that was pleading for love. His faith in her assertions was not shaken, but he feared so calm an exterior could conceal nothing deeper than a mere sisterly regard; and although he might value that to a great extent, at present he could have appreci- ated the love of Bessie's sister far more than that of his own. He went through the regular routine of farm ar- rangements, but it all wore a drudgery that before he had never realized. The green fields and meadows, that only so short a time before had been robed with so much loveliness, had suddenly lost their attractions, and he felt that he, too, must go away and seek some brighter spot. How much the eye of man is governed by the heart! When the soul from any cause is enshrouded with dark- ness what a shadow it throws over the most lovely scenes that surround our natural vision; and our natures are prone to play the truant, and hie away from beneath this shadow, instead of rising above it, and seeking light and happiness in the brighter atmosphere above. These bright autumn days soon passed away, and the frosty mantle of winter again covered the earth. Rena sat by the window of her room trying to solve the intri- cate problems for next day's lessons, but it was no little task, for her thoughts would ever and anon follow her eyes as they wandered across the brown woodland and t    <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6632-00000033"/> "     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE naked hillsides beyond the city's limits in the direction of that home that was far away.

"Yes, that is right," she solilloquized triumph- antly. "Well, I'm glad this is the last one of my lessons, for I shan't feel guilty now if I do think of something else." And again her thoughts overleaped the inter- vening space and wandered among the quiet hills of her childhood's haunts. The soft voice of her mother seemed to fall almost Audibly upon her ear, and now that she was far away her society seemed enhanced tenfold in value. "Why was I not satisfied there?" she murmured audibly, " when it is a thousand times more beautiful there than in these massive brick buildings, but then I could not be content there." "Heigh-ho! day-dreaming, Rena?" rang a gay voice, as the speaker rushed into the room. "Come, now, throw aside the musty, old books, and forget that ideal you was thinking about away off yonder, and let's go out to walk," and she attempted to jerk the book from her companion's hand. "O, but just hold on a minute, if you please," she continued, happening to notice a ring upon Rena's finger, which belonged to a gentleman rela- tive; but, being too large to wear with safety, had been for months deposited in a corner of her trunk without being observed. "Ah! but I know where you got that ring, Missy; you need not try to snatch it away. Charlie   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREA M.      65 Blakeman gave that to you when he called last night. Now be honest, and confess it all." "What makes you think that Charlie gave me the ring, Maggie?" asked Renaj hiding her hand with the glittering band upon it in a make-believe manner. "You must think he is remarkably generous." "He seems to be withyou; but if he had been really whole-souled he would have given it to me instead. You don't need such things." "Am I so valuable in myself that I need nothing to help me out? Really, Maggie, I consider that quite complimentary." "O, I mean that you are too much of an old fogy to value such things!" she replied. "But come, that ring contains a miniature, and I intend to see it." "Maggie, I will not let you see it," responded Rena, deliberately withdrawing her hand as though it was a matter of deep importance. There was an opening, with a spring upon the back of the ring, into a tiny recess, evidently intended for a miniature, but this had never been appropriated by the shadow of any one. Perhaps her relative had intended to have the picture of a fair, young face, with soft blue eyes, nestled there at some future day; but however that might be, it was still unoc- cupied. "Now, Rena, if you don't let me see that picture, I'll tell all the girls that you and Charlie Blakeman have been engaged ever since that night he brought you from the depot in the omnibus, and that you have his ring with his picture in it."    <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6632-00000034"/> "     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "And is that all?" quered the aggravating girl, still holding her hand behind her. "No, for I'll tell everything that I can think of; but do, Rena, let me see it; that's a good girl." "What do you want to see it for so badly, if you are so certain that it's Charlie Blakeman?" she asked. "Didn't you see the original of his shadow only a short time ago when we attended their college exercises?" "Of course I did; but do let me see this or I'll not like you one bit!" and she straightened herself up, and tried to look as indignant as possible. "That would be terrible punishment," responded her companion, dryly. "But still I can't afford to let you see it." "And don't you intend to let me see it at all?" she queried, her curiosity getting the upper hand of her ill humor. "Of course I don't," was the rejoinjder. "I'm going to keep this little secret to myself, just for effect. I think that you would willingly carry in all the wood and water for a week just to get to see it." "I think that you are abominably mean-that's just what I do think," responded Maggie, in a pouting man- ner. "But do tell me if it's Charlie Blakeman's picture." "I thought you were very positive on that point," laughed Rena. After a second thought, however, she remembered that such a report might accidentally reach that young gentleman's ears, and she had best change her room-mate's supposition, and so she answered: "I'll tell you honestly that I haven't Charlie Blakeman's pic-   -VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      67 ture, and this is not his ring; but I will not let you see it, that is settled." "Then isn't it that fellow that writes such sweet poetry to you? That one who has such '---- sweet dreams That come in the stilly night, And linger round like a holy spell 'Till they wake affection's light.' O, Rena! do let me see him, for I'm all curiosity to know what kind of a looking person he is." "O0 nonsense! Maggie, you worry me intolerably," responded Rena, as she took off the ring and locked it up to use on after occasions. "Do you suppose that I am going to tell you everything?"Maggie could not pout; she -liked to talk too well for that, and she was too good-natured to stay angry long at a time anyhow, and so her companion's refusal to gratify her curiosity could do no more than cause a momentary silence from which she soon rallied, saying: "Well, you have got to take a walk then, and I don't care how tired it makes you either." "Oh! I can't, Maggie; it's so cold, and then I want to read this new book that I've just taken out ot the library." "Let the book go to Jericho!" was the unpolished response, "and come along. You sit moping here in this room, and if you don't mind you'll be older than your grandmother before many years, and then that ideal wouldn't have you anyhow." Rena laid aside the book which she had just taken up to read, but it was not done h    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6632-00000035"/> 68     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE with a very good will, for she delighted more in solitude than in all the chattering nonsense that flowed in such spontaneous outhursts from her room-mate's rosy lips. Not that she did not like Maggie Wentworth, for she was a dear, light-hearted girl, and Rena dearly loved her, but she preferred using her more as a plaything for idle pas- time, and was glad enough to get rid of her when desir- ous of enjoying the solitude of her own thoughts. "Rena, you are a perfect simpleton to throw away your life in reading such dull books and idle dreaming, trying to make a perfect nun of yourself. I never will, and I'll sip all the sweets from life's flowers while sober you are trying to analyze their wonderful properties." "Why, you are growing poetic, Maggie," Rena smiled, as she donned her wraps preparatory to taking a walk in the cold wintry air. "I did not suppose your matter- of-fact nature ever dealt in anything more romantic than cabbage or potatoes, but I see it has wandered out among the flowers." "Well, cabbage and potatoes are not so unsightly, even to you when you are hungry; but let's get out of here," she urged, drawing her arm through that of her companion, and hastening her along. "Where do you intend to go?"Rena asked, as they sallied out into the open air. "I -don't want to go very far; this wind is very cutting." "Yes, but you shall, though," was the prompt rejoin- der. "You stay cooped up there in that warm room like a-a-yes, a hermit I was trying to think of; but we're going to the Rock Bridge; it's farther than your   VANQUISHED LIFS-DR EAM.      69 walks ever extend I know; however, it will make your cheeks pretty and red to walk so far, and that will only increase Charley Blakeman's fancy for you." "Surely then I ought to be willing to go even much farther than that if it would make me handsome," she answered, dryly; " but I should much rather remain at home, if I were allowed to do as I pleased." She was not afraid of bodily exercise if it was only needful, and had it been some projected jaunt with an object to attain-something to arouse her slumbering energies, she could readily have acquiesced in almost any- thing. Maggie, who had met her as an entire stranger, knew nothing of the bodily fatigue she had often endured, for although she made no effort to conceal her humble sphere in life, it was not often that she referred to the scenes through which she had passed. Rock Bridge was a pleasant summer resort when the trees and flowers were decked with their loveliest hues and the earth's green carpet invited the weary to rest upon its mossy bed. The huge rocks rise upward, pile upon pile, and the green mosses that were wont to cover their rugged deformities could but add a charm which nothing but the hand of nature is capable of giving. This spot was a favorite haunt for the desponding student whose not very pro- lific mind had vainly ransacked its limited stock of ideas in search of something suitable for " composition day." In this retreat she could sit in undisturbed quiet, except when the thundering locomotive, with its lengthy train, at intervals rushed by almost above her head, while the gay carol of the birds and the sweet perfume of the    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6632-00000036"/> 70      LINDEN HILL; OR, THE flowers lent an inspiration that might never be felt inside the college walls. Rena came bounding up the steps, upon returning from her walk, with cheeks as rosy and eyes as bright as if she were merely living to revel amid the flowers and sunshine of this world, instead of hiding her face from it, all with the hope of being some day better fitted to enjoy it. Although she was possessed of poetic sentiment and romantic style, she was not one ot those winsome creatures who can make themselves beloved or even popular with every one; and, in fact, she desired but few friends, and with those few she was far from lavish in her protestations of love or confidence. It was not that she was really unloving or had a heart incapable of being stirred by the emotions of sincere friendship, but a natural reserve, perhaps, also, a selfish coldness and lack of confidence in that which so often betrays trust and brings sorrow to those who have leaned upon it, caused her to stand aloof, while others, of less suspicious natures, were surrounded by bevies of frierds. "O, fiddle!" said Maggie, jerking vigorously at her bonnet-string; "do, Rena, untie this, or I shall be late going down to supper, and you are all ready to go." "O my!" she continued, brushing down her jetty black hair as she stood before the mirror, "I do wish the week was ended; I don't like to go school anyhow." "For shame, Maggie; but why do you wish the week was ended?" "Because I'm going to go home," she answered. "You need not laugh; I know I went home only last   VANQUISHED LIPE-DREAM.      7' week, but I'd rather be at home washing dishes and scrubbing floors than here studying these hard lessons, by odds!"Rena only smiled at her childish talk, and wondered how any one who had every provision made for their advancement, without one effort of their own, could be content to settle down perfectly satisfied with the un- romantic routine of domestic duties. "I know you don't fancy such commonplace work," she retorted, gaily; " but then you may have it to do some day; that's woman's sphere. And, by the way, you've got to go home with me when I go, and I will give you a few les- sons." "Thank you, but I have already been initiated and desire no further insight," she answered; " please ex- cuse me." "But I won't, although you need not wash any dishes," was the emphatic response. "But I want you to see my mother, and then I've such a good brother. I know that you will fall in love with him; but you must see him. But, goodness me!" she exclaimed, "if there isn't the last bell and we are not ready yet."    <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6632-00000037"/> 72     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE CHAPTER     VI. THE WENTWORTH FAMLY. "She hath a tear for pity, and a hand Open as day for melting charity." -ShaksUpeare. Richard Wentworth was met with a formal politeness, although Rena Selton had been deeply interested and had felt a great degree of pity for him after listening to his sister's account of his blighted happiness. A young and beautiful wife had been taken away within a few months after their life-path had merged into one, and in her grave he seemed to have buried all -the sunlight of his heart. Ever since that time he had walked beneath the shadow of that great bereavement, seeming to have no wish to rise above it. Rena felt that such a love must be true, even deathless. She had ever felt a deep repugnance toward those who could offer such deathless protestations of love, and could so soon forget both the love and the one who called it into existence. "If I should ever love," she would say, " life, death, distance, nor anything else can ever quench it. I believe love to be a divine sentiment, and not a mere human passion." The idea, as previously remarked, of living in some   VA NQZUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      73 one's affections for a time and then being suddenly put out, as a candle, to give place for some one else, is not pleasant to think about, and this is but a proof that all earthly loves are ended with the going out of this life. There may be, and most assuredly are, different degrees of earthly love, some being but sensual and lowly, while oth- ers, less selfish, seem to be nearer akin to that of the di- vine; but still that which is of the earth is earthly, and can never make its way into the realms of light. Selfishness is more or less mixed with all earthly love. I may love my child deeply and truly, and yet my selfish heart mur- murs if God sees fit to take him from my arms to shelter him in his own bosom. The individual who expects to find in the heart of nature an immortal love knows noth- ing as yet of the real nature ot that heart that can never be cultivated sufficiently to produce immortal fruits. But will we not know and love mostly deeply those whom we have most deeply loved on earth? Perhaps we may know them, but we are not to be wise above that which is written; and of this we feel assured, that when we shall see all those hosts attending "In myriads through the sky, Yet midst them all Thou only, O Lord, wilt fix the eye." The heart that longs for Iheaven, only because some loved one has been taken there, is forgetful of the greatest love that heaven or earth could ever witness. The source of heaven's eternal joys will be centered on the theme of the condescending love of Jesus. The truth was, that in Rena's ignorance of the human 5    <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6632-00000038"/> 74     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE heart she was looking for an immortal love in a mortal bosom--seeking a fruit of eternity growing in the sterile sands of time! It was a weak, a foolish thought, and instead of proving the depth of her own mind, only proved its weakness. As yet she knew not how fickle and deceitful the heart is; but how could she be expected to " judge another's heart" when she knew nothing of her own. Human loves belong to earth; heaven is the seat of divine ones. Mrs. Wentworth extended a labor- hardened hand with a motherly welcome. "Margaret has often spoken of you, and I am very glad to have you come and make us a visit. She is very wild and thoughtless, and I'm glad you try to curb her wayward disposition." "Maggie is a very good girl," Rena answered, some- what embarrassed, " and so near my own age that I do not feel capable of maintaining a very matronly watch over. her." "O certainly not," was the good-natured rejoinder; but Maggie has told me that your advice has often been of great service to her," and the fat old lady bustled away to attend to the many household duties that necessarily devolved upon her. It was a cheerful, yet quiet country seat, only a few miles from the city, with a large and commodious farm house, which itself, as well as its in- mates, seemed to invite the weary to a rest under its broad roof. Rena felt that she had indeed found a de- lightful retreat away from the mental labor of the week, a place where she could feast upon nature's unperverted loveliness, as well as enjoy the society of a well-bred   VANQUISHED LIFE DREAM.       75 family, whose rustic lives and natural good sense had never been perverted by the fashionable foibles that dis- tort and destroy so much that might otherwise be lov- eable in many a life; and this was but the beginning of her many visits, for during the succeeding summer days she frequently spent a day or two with Maggie, roaming over the green hills that cradled in her country home, and invariably returning to her studies invigorated in body as well as mind. By this means the monotony of her school days was considerably modified, and she could enjoy the society of her newly-made friends, feel- ing perfectly at home under their hospitable roof. Rich- ard, although at first so very seclusive, had gradually laid aside his reserve, and would even occasionally ac- company them in their rambles. He was intelligent and handsome, and, added to this, the depth of soul which he seemed to possess, could not help making his com- panionship somewhat agreeable. Yet she only valued his society in the same light as she did that of Maggie, but perhaps his intelligent conversation may have ren- dered it more agreeable. She almost venerated the affection that was so true to the dead, and regarded him as a rare example of fidelity, which to some degree softened the rigid decree she had pronounced against men in general. They often sang together quaint old melodies as they sat in the verandah's shade; they read the same books and talked upon topics of general inter- est while Maggie used to declare that it would give her the night-mare to listen to such cold, scientific logic. But the weeks and  months had been gliding swiftly *    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6632-00000039"/> 76     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE away and Rena's school-girl life was nearing its close. She had gone home with her companion for the last time to enjoy the hospitality of the friends ever to be held in estimation by her; and had wandered for the last time among the green hills and vales that had helped to brighten her self-imposed exile. "I suppose you do not regret that your school days are so near over, Miss Selton," remarked Richard, in a very-matter-of fact manner, as she sat upon the green arranging a bouquet of beautiful wild flowers which she and Maggie had just been gathering. "In one sense I do not, Mr. Wentworth," she re- plied, candidly, " and yet there is nothing I delight in more than my studies." "We need not cease to learn because we are done with school," he continued; " the greatest of life's great lessons I have often thought were beyond school life." She supposed he meant the lessons of disappointment and blighted hopes, and a sigh involuntarily escaped her lips as she thought of the bitterness of soul that must necessarily follow in their train. "You will doubtless soon forget the idle rambles we have taken when you return to dearer friends and more familiar haunts," he continued, picking up a flower that had fallen at his feet and tearing it ruthlessly asunder. ," No, I shall never forget," was the warm response. "They will ever prove verdant spots in my memory wherever I am." "And do you regret to leave them?" he asked, in a Mrodulated tone.   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       " ' How can you ask me such a question?" she re- plied. '"Don't you suppose I want to see my mother when it has been so long since I saw her last?" "I should think so, most assuredly, and I've no doubt but you will be happier with her and others than you could be here, but we will miss you very much." "It is one thing to miss a person and quite another to regret their absence," she remarked, laughingly. 'I have an idea that my case would come in the first clause." "Do you really believe that, Rena?" he asked, with a scrutinizing glance. "Do you really believe that to me, at least, your presence brings no happiness?"Her fingers appeared remarkably clumsy, for the flowers would drop from her hand, and when arranged presented anything but a tasteful appearance; but this was too much of a leading question for her to permit her eyes to meet his glance. "I think what the world calls happiness is oftener than any other way a more selfish feeling," she remark- ed, evasively, not realizing that there was very little point or meaning to the expression. "For my own part I have never expected the happiness in this world that many look for, but have learned, in the last few years, that my mother's presence comes nearer bringing hap- piness than everything else beside." "Earthly happiness is often very transitory," he artic- ulated slowly, after a few minutes' silence. "I at least have known comparatively little, but perhaps it was    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6632-00000040"/> 78      LINDEN  ILL; OR, THE more than I deserved." A deep drawn sigh heaved his breast, and Rena felt that she must have been mistaken in his meaning, and even regretted that she had so thoughtlessly ventured upon forbidden ground. How- ever, it was too late to retract now, so she said nothing. He had professed to trust Him who is the same amid tempests of grief as in the genial sunlight of the heart's brighter hours, but never having learned that lesson of submission herself she was not prepared to enter -into his feelings of resignation. "Isn't that pretty?" she at length broke the silence by asking, at the same time holding up the gorgeous bouquet which she had managed to arrange only half- way tastefully; " and now I am ready to go," she con- tinued, as he gave a very unappreciative nod in answer to her queries. "Rena," he murmured gently, while retaining the hand which he had taken to assist her in rising from her grassy seat, " my judgment tells me that it is useless for me to speak that which my heart tempts me to say. I feel, however, that if ' I perish, I perish,' and my heart prompts me to ask you to be my wife!" The hand was withdrawn with a shudder-"Bah!' she mentally articulated; " he sinks to the level of the ' common herd' at last. I don't believe there is such a thing as real love among men," and in the confusion of the moment she hastened to meet Maggie's approaching steps, and leave Richard to his solitude. It was not a pleasant awakening from her little ro-   VAitNQUISIIED LIFE-DREA.      79 mance, for she had no affection for him aside from a deep sympathy for the grief she imagined was almost holy. The sacred shrine which she had pictured in the darkened chambers of his heart where the image of the departed one had been deposited, and yet was ever fresh in view, was suddenly demolished, and to have that little bit of romance thrown away, even though she was the one selected to fill that sanctum, was slightly breaking in on her arrangements. "What's the use in believing these wonderful declara- tions?" she soliloquized with considerable bitterness. '"As soon as out of sight you're out of mind. I've always believed Phil to be the truest fellow in existence, and I dare sayohe's been in love-half a dozen times since I saw him." But a slight cloud was visible upon her counten- ance as she uttered the words. A long time had elapsed since she had even indirectly heard from him, but her un- tending nature would not suffer her to make inquiries concerning him. Their little correspondence had long since been dropped, as Rena feared that by means of it a sentiment might be nourished which would otherwise starve, and her exacting nature asked for no other love than such as thorns and briars could never choke out when once it had taken root in the heart. Philip, although he believed in the deathlessness of real affection, did not possess the same extravagant views which characterized her life, and was, consequently, deeply touched at her seeming heartlessness.

The echo of a long-lost name; A breath, an idle hour's brief talk; The shadow of an arrant naught; A flower that blossoms for a day, Dying next morrow; A stream that hurries on its way, Singing of sorrow; A fortune, that to lose were gain; A word of praise, perchance of blame; The wreck of a time-bandied name Aye, this is glory, this is fame!" "Oh, my! what a superb looking personage!" ex- claimed Nettie Strawhridge, as she glanced out through the window of her room where a bevy of girls had col- lected during recreation hours to talk over their various topics of interest, however little of interest these things might have for the outside world. He was a tall, grace- ful-looking man, and walked with dignified precision up the walk, though seemingly in great haste. "Isn't he grand looking, though? I wonder who he will condescend to call upon. I wish it was me," said pert little Mattie Goodman. "Wouldn't I feel important    <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6632-00000042"/> 82     LINDEN HILL; OR, 7HE over it? But I intend to play the part of servant, or lis- tener, and see who he asks for," and away she hied down the broad stairway to happen near the great en- trance-door just as the bell rang. This was a common occurrence with Mattie, for she always liked to know ,I who came to see who," and troubled herself to find out accordingly. If there was a young lady seated in the public parlor to entertain a gentleman friend who had called to see her, Mattie was ready to grasp up her in- structor, and rush for the piano in the parlor, although her practicing room might be far distant. Of course, she always expressed a great deal of regret that she had thus intruded, and asked very politely to be " excused" for interrupting them, and as soon as she got a good view of the masculine face withdrew to tell all the girls " what kind of a looking fellow had called on Madge Lorn or Mollie Sparks, etc.," and that she " acted out embarrass- ment to perfection,. but took good care to take items be- fore she left the room."  "Well, what discoveries did you make?" asked Jennie Moreland, with a smile, as Mattie came bounding back into the room, her short hair flying out wildly, caused by the swiftness of her movements. "Was it some one to see yourself, or me, which?" "Fiddle! Do you suppose that such a dignified per- sonage would condescend to come to'see such as you or me? Why, I declare, he looks like he was born every bit a nobleman! Siuch a commanding appearance! such dignity! He looked just like he thought the Brus- sels carpet was not good enough for him to walk upon.'   VANQUISHED LIE-DREAM.,      83 "Please take a short breathing-spell, Miss Goodman," ejaculated Mollie Sparks, as she raised her hand to inti- mate a desire for silence. "You perfectly overwhelm us with your rhapsodies over this wonderful being. Pray, is he human?" "I'm sure-I can't say, but then I'm certain that he personates my ideal of a real gefitleman. His very look -and tone represent an uncompromising dignity that would not be trifled with." "So might a desperado have that uncompromising look," remarked Miss Sparks, with a shrug. "I dare say he's only an adventurer." "Mollie Sparks, you'd never say that if you could see him. It would be the heighth of my ambitiqn to have such a distinguished-looking individual call upon me."' "But you have not told us yet who he called to see," suggested Myrie Rowland, for the first time taking part in the conversation. "Did he call on the President's daughter?" "Fiddle! no. He called to see Madame Theroux, and was almost frantic because shewas not here. I know that he must be passionately in love with her, for he just talked in that way to Mrs. Preston, the President's wife. I  came away to report, and left him in that lamentable condition, and can't say how he will make it." "Madame Theroux must be remarkably fascinating to make such a catch," remarked Ollie Mead, significantly. "She gets more beaux than any of the other teachers, and she only a widow." "What disadvantage is there in being a widow when    <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6632-00000043"/> 84     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE one is beautiful and accomplished?" was the rejoinder. And surely there seemed to be no disadvantage, so far as suitors were concerned, in the case of Madame Emnilie Theroux. She was young-seemingly quite so-exceed- ingly beautiful, as well as accomplished, and seemed to command general admiration. And -she had evidently seen " better days," as her costly apparel, although some- what out of style, would readily indicate. She was now, as she said, a disconsolate widow, and the mother of the beautiful little, blue-eyed Adele, the very picture of her herself. At the time we speak of her, she was taking charge, perhaps through absolute necessity, of a depart- ment in the institution of which we have been speaking. "Well, were I a widow, I would not try to appear so girlish," said Mollie Sparks, dryly. "I always like to see every one stay in their proper place." "But she is young," was the rejoinder, " and good looking, too. What good would it do to spoil her pretty eyes by grieving over some old fogy that tears could never recall?" "That's what I say," chimed in Mattie Goodman. "I'd never grieve long for the President of the United States if such a man as this was to offer himself as a con- solation. Oh, you never saw such eyes!" ".Hush!" whispered a bystander, nudging her with the elbow. "Some one rapped at the door." There was an immediate answer to the summons, and Mrs. Preston's pleasant face was seen through the open doorway. "I was looking for Miss Selton," she remarked as she entered the room holding a card between her taper   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       85 fingers. "There is a gentleman in the parlor below who seems in search of Madame Theroux, and as I told him  that you and herself were intimate friends, and that you would be more likely to know just where she went than any one else, he insisted that you should be sent for." And she handed Rena, who before had been a silent lis- tener to the interesting account given, a delicate card upon which was transcribed in a beautifidl but bold hand the name of "Castello de Montreville;" " a distinguished foreigner, it seems, who has chosen to make the 'sunny South ' his home for a time," remarked Mrs. Preston, a3 she observed the look of blank amazement that over- spread the girl's face. "He says that he has but a short time to stay; that pressing business will demand his immediate return, and that having made this long jour- ney m order to see the face that. haunts his day and night dreams he cannot, dare not, leave without look- ing upon that one who has long been so dear to his heart." "Quite lover-like," suggested Mattie. "Why can't some one talk of me in that way?" "You're too young yet, Miss Mattie," replied Mrs. Preston;  , but come, Miss Selton, we are keeping him waiting." "I   know but little, Mrs. Preston," answered Rena while her hand seemed to tremble beneath the weight of the card she still retained. "She told me that she and Adele were going home with Abbie Matson, which is only a few miles out of town. Professor Preston can direct him there much better than myself."    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6632-00000044"/> 86     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "But he wishes to see you," continued Mrs. Preston, "and as he seems to be a man of some distinction it would appear rather rude to stay away." Rena, although not to be called bashful, was apt to shrink from coming in contact with real or imaginary greatness. She had not yet learned the emptiness of worldly greatness, for this is not taught in the world's colleges, but in the school of Christ. The world's school may instruct in the various branches of science, which are all very good and useful for the world's advance- ment, but it never teaches that the world is sunk in ruin, and that man is utterly lost, a hopeless wreck floating onward toward the great ocean of eternity, destined to everlasting woe unless grace divine intercept his course. Such may teach that man is a sinner, but even then it would seek to build up and improve the carnal nature by good habits and intellectual culture. But this is not God's way; the old nature must be set aside; all things must be new. These divine truths, we again say, may be learned at the feet of Jesus, but never in the schools of this world's Gamaliels. And she had not yet learned that " there is none great but God," or how unsubstan- tial the platform is that sustains this world's greatness. Had it been Charlie Blakeman, or some one whom she considered only as equal or inferior to herself she would not have hesitated in the least, but how could one of her insignificance meet and converse with one of the world's renowned ones? And yet she had never felt her nothingness before God. It was man's greatness and not God's that she stood in awe of.   VANQUISHED LIFE DREAM.       87 "Come, come," said Mrs. Preston, as she pulled her gently along, and they entered the apartment where the distingnished "Castello De Montreville" was pacing back and forth across the room with a lordly mien. "I suppose this is Madame Theroux's friend," he re- marked, blandly, as he drew near and extended a well- jeweled hand. "Most happy to meet you," he con- tinued, as he still held the trembling hand, '"and feel exceedingly thankful that you were so generous as to leave your studies to gratify my earnest wishes. Any one that is beloved by my esteemed .Madame Theroux cannot be else than dear to myself also." Rena gave a   slight "ahem!" and awkwardly an- swered   " yes," for she was as yet ignorant of the fact that ," 'Tis not all gold that glitters," and, therefore, was completely dumbfounded with the ready flow  of lan- guage that graced the personage before her. She had but just a short time before returned from the Went.- worth's, after the little romantic incident related of her there, but she felt that that little episode was completely thrown into the shade by the statelier magnificence of the play that now occupied the stage of life before her. But she was destined soon to take a valuable lesson in this branch of study-the uncertainty of human greatness-a lesson that was not soon forgotten, and one that- she sought to impress upon the minds of others by means of Uncouth rhymes, which, if lacking in poetic measure and softness, were not devoid of moral truth. "Miss Selton is quite young," interposed Mrs. Preston, in an-apologetic'manner, for she was not slow to detect    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6632-00000045"/> 88     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE the girl's awkward embarrassment, " but she is a diligent student, and we could do no less than appreciate her for her industry." "Ah! and that is quite praiseworthy," he responded. in the tone of one who, although great in himself, was not above observing little things. "Diligence and persever- ance will eventually expand the mind until it becomes great and grand. There is nothing so much to be ad- mired as real greatness. But I am anxious to learn where Madame is visiting," he remarked, abruptly. "Could you not send some one to direct me? I would promptly reward all favors, and I could scarcely bear the disappointment of leaving without seeing her." Rena gave all the information she happened to know, and quietly withdrew, leaving the dark, handsome Mr. De Montreville to arrange and settle his own plans. He had a large, piercing eye, the very glance of which was enough to silence all opposition. "What could he be to Madame Theroux?" she men- tally queried. "Was he a rejected lover or one who had stronger claims?" "Isn't he grand "and noble-look- ing?" whispered Mattie Goodman, who had again hap- pened in the great entrance-hall, and now met Rena as she was gliding away. "I declare, I really envy you for having the pleasure of a conversation- with him." "I'm sure I did not covet the honor," responded the individual addressed, at once resuming her natural, cold self, now that she was not in the presence of superiors. "Why should I care to sit and hear a man tell how he   VANQUISHED LITE-DREAM.      89 adored another woman? It might be more endurable if self was the adored one." "O fiddle! I never should expect such honors as th/--the honor of being noticed by him would be enough for me." "You are perfectly silly, Mat," replied Mollie Sparks. "How do know that he amounts to anything?   He may be somebody's boothlack." "Yes, but he is somebody," responded Hattie Day, the innkeeper's niece, who by this time had joined the crowd. "He's as rich as Rothschild himself, for uncle has frequently heard of him in Mississippi, where the family, and especially Castello, were looked up to with almost the homage due to kings. He brought a big lot of money - quite a small fortune, I guess; we hope to buy real estate--and gave it to uncle to lock up in his safe." "I should think your uncle would know just how much he had," suggested Miss Sparks. "Do you suppose he was afraid to take Mr. Montre- ville's word," she asked tartly. "He has known the honorable name of Castello De Montreville for too many years to doubt his responsibility; that was enough for him." "But perhaps some one else knew that the name was responsible, and borrowed it for effect!" remarked Rena Selton, who being in possession of a rather distrustful nature, was sure, sooner or later, to look on the dark side of events." "Rena, you're a perfect heathen to talk that way    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6632-00000046"/> 90     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE about such a gentleman," retorted Mattie, laughing while the former passed on to her own apartment. But a few hours elapsed, however, before Madame Theroux, Adele, Abbie, Matson, etc., with their gallant escort were again ushered into the comfortable parlor, where for a short time they remained, and then the gentleman de- parted to his money-bags and to the inn. ,' I'll bet anything that they are engaged," whispered Mattie, to a companion as she crossed the hall. ( "I never saw any one act so lover-like as he did, bending over her hand so adoringly before he went away. O, wouldn't I like to have such a lover, though?" Madame Theroux appeared at the supper table bright, smiling as usual, with no traces of a shadow having cross- ed her handsome face. But she was not one to reveal her feelings, and one could not readily tell whether the meeting had been a pleasure or otherwise. Days passed and she still moved about in the same placid manner, although the pressure of her lover's affairs did not seem to summon him away, as his daily visits would indicate. She still met him daily in the great spacious parlor, although never alone, and still listened with calmness to the im- passioned words that fell so freely from his tongue, regardless of lookers-on or listeners. -It was a truly romantic scene; but she persistently withstood every entreaty. "Let's take a walk," she whispered to Rena Selton, as drawing her arm through that of the simple country girl, they slowly descended the broad stone steps of the great piazza. "I am in a quandary," she remarked in an un-   VANQUISHED LFE-.LDRiAMM.     9 dertone, " and would like to get your advice; I really don't know what to do."  "Why don't you go to some one who is capable of advising you, then?" suggested her companion. I don't feel capable of advising persons who know much more than myself, and especially in serious matters." "Monsieur De Montreville," she continued, without seeming to notice the excuse, , wants to deed a planta- tion of his in the South to Adele. He says, besides that, his possessions are vast, that riches are of but little con- sequence to him in his lonely condition, and that as Adele is my child he would rather she would have it than any one else. I don't know whether to accept the gift or not. Professor Preston is very much in favor of my accepting it, and considers it quite right and proper, but I don't knowl what to do." "Why don't you marry him? Can not the knowl- edge of his deep affection for you teach you to love him?" asked the girl frankly. "Love him, Rena! adore him! I could fall upon my knees and worship him, but I dare not." "I can't understand why you refuse to go with him if you really love him thus," was the response. "I'm sure it would remove all obstacles out of the way, if it were me thus loved and loving." "Rena Selton, I know him better than you think, and I am afraid of him," she answered with emphasis. I loa e hiln better than life, but I know the depths of his strong, unyielding passions.

I cannot, I dare not go; but what would you do in regard to the acceptance of this generous proposition?" "I don't pretend to know what would be best for you to do," answered her companion. "I can only say that if it were myself, I could not place myself under any ob- ligations by accepting such favors from him; but Prof. Preston ought to understand the rules of propriety much better than myself." A shadow for an instant crossed the fair face of the widow, for it was to her, as it would have been to others, who are not sustained by a living, active faith in a living God, a sore temptation. It is true that she wore a " form of godliness," so far as profession was concerned, but her gay, worldly life "denied the power thereof." She, as well as many others, evidently used a profession of religion for about the same purpose that men use lightning-rods; not because there is any thing attractive about them, but simply to ward off God's vengeance. A fear of the " wrath to come "-a belief in the ower of God, causes many to adopt an outward form, which, alas! is wholly outward! Like Cain, who sought to honor God by bringing as an offering the fruits of his own hands, such seek by morality and an outward form of godliness, together with sacraments and other ordinances, to offer something to Him, while in heart they are yet going out still farther and farther from the pres- ence of God. But it is not Madame Theroux alone, my reader, who has been guilty of such blind folly, for you and I are, or have doubtless been, guilty of the same fruitless endeavors.    VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       93 "I don't believe that I will accept the gift," she answered thoughtfully; "I feel like it would be placing me under obligations to him, which would render my position an awkward one." "Don't allow yourself to be influenced by my opin- ions," responded her companion. "You know that my knowledge of the world's proprieties is very limited." But I feel myself that the gift is too large to accept," was the reply. "Adele has already been over-loaded with presents, such as a grand piano, guitar, birds and cages, etc., but this is a gift of far,greater magnitude. I cordially thank you for your kind advice," she continued, with one of her sweetest smiles, as they were about to separate for the evening; she to meet her lover, and the other to resume the studies of to-morrow's lessons. "There is something mysterious about it all," solilo- quized the student, as she bolted the door to keep out those who might intrude to interrupt her evening studies. "She told me a long time ago that her husband was jealous and extremely passionate, and that she did not live happily with him. And I have gone to her room at three different times to see his picture, which she told me she possessed, and she was every time too busy to show it to me. I can't help believing that this is her husband, who has found out her retreat, and that she is not a widow." She seated herself at the little table and took up her Geometry which she was reviewing, but vague suppositions would crowd into her mind, and she found it very difficult to prove the reality of a thing by first proving the absurdity of something else.

Of earth's coveted greatness? Of Castello De Montreville's wealth and lordly position, or of that loving and gentle mother and other loved ones far away? A week more glided by, and the legal documents had all been drawn up, for Madame Theroux, perhaps influenced by others, had accepted the gift so generously offered, and the rich, the envied foreigner was the observed of all observers among the elite of the place. The frequency of the grand champagne suppers given at his suite of rooms at Day's Hotel we are not prepared to recount. The grand livery outfits with the fast young men of the place were numerous, for Monsieur was too true to wait upon any lady except the one of his choice, who could never be induced to ride with him alone. But, to make a long story short, we will say that his glory somewhat re- sembled the meteor's glow, that dies away so soon in darkness. A telegram, or a consciousness of it being needful, summoned him speedily away, and without ap- prising any one of his intentions, he suddenly disappeared. It was a dreadful take off, as the enormous unpaid hotel and livery bills could attest, and others, perhaps influenced by the recommendations of good John Day, were almost as badly duped. Poor little Adele was obliged to give up her boasted piano and other presents, and, as a last drop of bitterness in her cup of mortification, the official returns from the office of registry informed her that the   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       95 "Iand was indeed there, but that it was not the posses- sions of such an individual as Castello De Montreville, who was unknown there."

The last term of school was almost ended and a scene of busy preparation was going on, for "readings " were to be rehearsed and exhibitions attended to, so that there was no use for drones in all that busy hive. The little episode of romance in Rena's school life being so sud- denly ended, she bade a final farewell to the green haunts where she had passed so many sunny hours, and returned with new zeal to the arduous tasks that lay before her. And although the nearer the day for her departure the more anxious she was to see the dear, familiar faces far away; there was, nevertheless, a feeling of regret at parting with many of that cheerful sisterhood with whom she had so long been sojourning. But it was all over at last, as all things earthly sooner or later are, the last good-bye spoken and the last protestation of deathless friendship exchanged, and Rena Selton passed from out those memorable walls to seek her childhood's home. Childhood's home! What memories cluster around these   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      97 words. What heart that has reached life's after years and does not respond to this theme long sung by poets! But little change was visible in this home since last we saw it, for that rural district was not famous for im- provements; and yet, as she clapsed a father's palsied hand, and pressed a kiss upon her mother's pallid cheek, her heart seemed to feel the weight of a change not visible to the eye. It was not that she spurned the humble spot which gave her being, or was mortified with the rustic simplicity of the friends she loved, for even in her limited contact with the outer world she had learned that the brightest gems of earth are hot found in this world's broad highway. The change was in herself. She was called a cold, unimpassioned woman-one that with fortitude could meet every difficulty and brave life's storms alone; but how little did they know how that heart, thrown back upon it's own stubborn will, often yearned for something to rest upon-something more solid than the world's formal emptiness. Dear reader, is it any shame to womanhood that her life was lone, especially when far away from a mother's sym- pathy, without a heart to beat responsive to her own? Hers was only a human heart, just such as you and I possess, and longed for human sympathy.' But never could she be truly termed a woman of the world, for that gay, care-forgetting nonchalance, which is so charac- teristic of the world's model women, was not there; and those alone who knew her best were prepared in any degree to understand her nature. And perhaps her mother, more than all others, was prepared to understand    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6632-00000050"/> 98      LINDEN HILL; OR, THE and sympathize with her. "Well, here's everything just as I left them," she remarked, as seating herself in the shade of her favorite tree her eyes sought each familiar object. "And yet it does not look the same, but for my life I could not tell wherein it is different." "I see nothing that manifests half so much change as yourself," was the tender response, and her mother looked anxiously into her face. "You are pale, Rena, and I fear have overtaxed yourself." "It's nothing, mother, only I'm tired--tired," she an- swered laughingly. "But I'm going to rest now for awhile." "And how long is that?" was queried. "Can't say, I'm sure; but as that space of time is not limited, I will say until I get somewhat over the effects of this long in-door confinement and begin to feel some- thing like my former self. O, don't!" she continued, as the window was rudely thrown open, " you will frighten the little things away.', "They're not so easily frightened," Mrs. Selton smiled, as the mother wren with her newly-fledged brood chattered above the window casement, the little home which for many years they had held in undisputed possession. "I guess they are afraid I have come back to peep into their nests again and are holding council over it,' laughed Rena. "How many times I have climbed to their nests when I was a child -don't that sound ma- turely?" and again the gay laugh rang out upon the evening air to gladden the hearts that had so long yearned for her coming.   VANQUISHED LIZFE-DREAM.      99 "Yes, it does sound strangely," was the sober rejoin- der, "and it seems so short a time; truly this life passes like a ' weaver's shuttle--a mere dream.'" "It does not appear so short a time to me," she an- swered earnestly; cc and I often wonder at people talking in that way. It seems to me that I have had aspirations and plans enough to have lived a long time, but I'm not world-weary on account of it."  "You have too many plans and aspirations, Rena. You must forget them all and rest a long time, or you will never be yourself again." "There is not much. rest intended for me," she re- marked somewhat bitterly. "I've not a dollar in the world, and of course must soon go at something,' "But you will not go away again?" she asked, plead- ingly. "I had hoped that you would be content to remain near me at least what little time I am here," and the hollow, consumptive cough that rang as a death. knell upon the evening breeze told that her prediction was no idle dream. "I will never leave you again, mother," she answered, looking up into the faded face with it's sunken though once beautiful blue eyes, which were bent so lovingly upon her. "I have no doubt but I  shall find employ- ment near that will do very well, and as for happiness, I am sure I shall find more near you than anywhere else, so you need have no fear." A   ray of unpretending happiness lit up the pale face and sent a thrill of pleasure to the heart of Rena, as she donned her bonnet for a stroll among the haunts from    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6632-00000051"/> xoo     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE which she had been so long an exile. Her health was indeed delicate, and as she had exhausted the last of her individual funds during her absence, necessity threw her upon her own exertions, for her pride was too strong to suffer her to " eat the bread of dependence," although it might be offered in the utmost charity. The birds caroled gayly among the old apple trees while the ugly watch-dog wagged his tail in happy recog- nition of his returned friend, and even the old red cow, as she hied home from the green meadows, seemed to offer a mute welcome. "Come, Nero," she said, patting the dog's shaggy head, "let us go to the old school-house; you and I have often gone there together," and away they bounded, each apparently feeling that they had found a long-lost but faithful friend. Poor Nero had in- deed been a silent but true friend in the past, and now, although age had dulled his watchful propensities, he could not but be held in estimation for his services of the past. "Isn't this natural, though?" she articulated, not knowing whether she was talking to herself or her mute companion, as she seated herself behind the rickety old desk in the familiar school room, now covered with dust. "Be quiet, Nero, you're my only pupil now;" but she gave a start as the echo of her own voice resounded through the empty room, and then smiled at her own childish folly. "How faithfully I've tried 'to teach the young ideas how to shoot' in this old 'tumble-down,' where the lizzards now hold high carnival," she mentally soliloquized. "And what changes have taken place since first, a mere child myself, I commenced the ardu-   VANQ UISHED LIFE-DREAM.      10 I ous task.

And this desk belonged to Emery Wild, that dear, dear boy, but he has passed beyond the shadows of time into that invisible world! How proud, how ambitious he was, and how determined, to excel, but it is all over now and God alone knows where his destiny is fixed!"She leaned her head pensively upon her hand, while Nero, who had lain him- self down in the open doorway, wagged his tail in sympathetic silence. "What a strange, mysterious world this is!" she still murmured inaudibly, and with a shud- der, as if she instinctively felt the spirits-of the departed ones near her.  "I can't see why these aspirations should be formed in the human heart only to be blighted. But come, old friend, these recollections bring too much sad- ness, when my heart needs sunshine," and she removed her bonnet from it's accustomed nail and sauntered away. Every spot was so familiar-.the old Buckley spring at the root of the quivering cottonwood, and the huge oaks that so proudly lifted their green heads heavenward, unhurt by the successive generations of infant feet that had trod- den beneath them, all familiar as household words. "' Well, this seems like the days of 'Auld Lang Syne,' " she remarked gayly, as she seated herself at the supper which a sister's hand had carefully prepared. "I believe it makes victuals taste better for father to 'say grace  over them, anyway.'" "I have an idea that your long walk has done-more toward seasoning your supper than anything else," was the quiet rejoinder.

A brighter tinge was visible upon her cheek, but she made no reply. Their last evening under the old tree, and every word then spoken was still fresh in her memory, but what did it amount to? Did he still remember it, or had it been drowned in the schemes and speculations of life, even as she had given it up for the hope of a name and position in the world? It was only a dream of the past-something she could and would not forget, and yet did not wish renewed. Had he met her with the same brotherly greeting that bright- ened their earliest years, she would have been only too happy to see him; but as matters stood, she felt like something guilty, she could not tell of what, and did not know whether she hoped he was true or false. But the remaining summer days dragged lazily away, and when the hazy autumn made its advent, Rena took her place in the village school. Although she had ever been suc- cessful as a teacher, she felt that the school-room was not the place best suited for her, as she needed some out- door exercise, and her over-taxed nervoussystem needed a more congenial clime, where nature's soft mantle would protect her from the wintry winds that swept so ruth-   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      103 lessly around her. But that dear, maternal presence for- bade a thought of leaving these rural haunts, and as at the present there appeared to be no room for choosing occupations, she therefore wisely took the place offered. We say wisely, but was it human reason which prompted her to make a decision in this matter? By no means. She might to some degree have been possessed of natural judgment, and mankind are prone to think every wise movement made is dictated by their own individual wis- dom, but of these wonderful truths how little, at most, do we know. -God was leading her, was trying to break her stubborn will, and although it was in love and not in anger that He sought to accomplish His purposef He must take away some earthly prop before He could arrest the restless feet that were so desirous to climb the height of earthly fame.

And it left only a faint halo of light brood- ing over the verdant plains of childhood, as the stricken heart looked back with a self-reproachful gaze. -But the reader will now return with us to the opening chapter of our story, after so long apreface, where the blow fell with such crushing weight upon a heart but poorly pre- pared to receive it.

If ever on thine eyelid stood the tear That pity had engendered, drop one here! -Cowper. Weeping friends gave place in sympathetic silence as Rena Selton passed over the threshold of what had once been called a home, but her heart whispered that that was an empty word now, the realities of home having taken flight with her mother's disembodied spirit. She passed in a bewildered manner through the house and entered that mystic chamber--the place of death-and there falling at her surviving parent's feet. who still sat in speechless grief beside the unconscious remains of that loved one, she buried her face in his bosom, and gave way to the tumult of grief that was raging in her breast.

"Her life went out so suddenly--it was but a moment, a parting pressure of my hand, and she was gone."   VANQUISHED LIFE DREAM.       105 The unhappy mourner groaned and again buried her face in her father's bosom. "Will you look at your mother now," asked a friend, approaching her tenderly. "Oh, I cannot! I cannot! Life is not there," she an- swered, swaying herself to and fro, the picture of utter despair. "If she had only left one word, one kind ad- monition for me," she continued. She did not remember that her mother's whole life had been one of loving words and kind admonitions, and her stricken heart longed for some parting bequest that she might treasure up as almost holy. "She could not, Rena," whispered Bessie, with lips that quivered through grief at thoughts of her own be- reavement. "She could not speak after the blood first burst so freely from her lips,- and it was only a few mo- ments until all was over." And the sister's head was again bowed in silent anguish. Mrs. Selton had been attacked with hemorrhage of the lungs, which had been threatening for many years, and, as it had long been feared, her life was suddenly terminated. "Rena, this is decidedly wrong," remonstrated an aged acquaintance, although her own eyes were suffused with tears for the lost friend of so many years. "We have am- ple reason to believe that all is well with her now, and should, therefore, submit to the will of God with a quiet resignation."

"To me it seems hn- just, and I cannot recognize it as an act of love, even though I know it has been done by an Almighty Power." The iron will was still there in its unbroken power. The hand of Infinite Love had removed the strongest pil- lar of her earthly happiness, that she might learn to lean in child-like trust upon Himself; but her obstinate nature spurned the balm that would have sent healing to her wounded heart, and selfishly sought to bear alone the burden that fell with such crushing force. "It is too much, too much," she murmured with a pathetic wail that would have touched the most hardened heart, and hiding her face against the white drapery that concealed the dead, she felt that every hope or aspiration of life had ended there. "Rena," (the low tremulous voice aroused her) "you cannot feel as I do," and the father looked with re- proachful tenderness upon her, but no words save of the deepest love fell from his tongue. For nearly half a century she has walked by my side, more faithful than my shadow, for she never deserted me in my darkest hours. Think what my life must be without her!" This appeal was more effectual in arousing her from that apathy of selfish grief than a multitude of reproaches could have been. She threw her arms -around his neck and drew his silvered head against her bosom, while warm, sympathetic tears baptized the locks she twined around her trembling fingers. Through the long night -he watched beside that rigid form-the last night that   VANQ UISHED LIFE-DREAM.      I 07 she could ever claim the presence of one so much be- loved, and through all the busy preparations for the last solemn rites of death she seemed as if walking in some strange, mysterious dream, from which, try never so much, she could not wake. No pompous rites or magnificent funeral array helped to solemnize the quiet scene. A grave was made on the hill-side in the quiet wood, where many a kindred form was sleeping in the narrow domin- ions of the dead, around which that company of stricken mourners gathered. Perchance those desponding souls, for the time, rose above the gloomy surroundings, as the thrilling strains, "Asleep in Jesus, blessed sleep, From which none ever wake to weep," floated like incense upon the evening air, and, may we not trust, up to the throne of the Majesty on high? A short, pathetic prayer was offered up-a petition plead- ing that a double portion of that grace which she no longer needed to sustain her down here might restf upon the disconsolate survivors, and with a long, last look of tenderest love, the no-longer suffering body was lowered into the silent tomb; from whence, may it not be hoped, she will arise, "clothed in His likeness," when He shall "come to be glorified in His saints," and to reward those "who wait for His appearing?"But thepeaceful sleep in Jesus "will not prevent the awaiting; the place of waiting may be changed from earth to heaven, but the earnest longings of the soul will ever be, "Come, Lord I    <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6632-00000055"/> 108     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE Jesus, come quickly." The departed spirit may sweetly rest, as it were, in "Abraham's bosom," "Above the toil, above the din, That now surrounds this lower life." But not until the mortality of these natural bodies is , swallowed up of life," until " we appear with Him in glory," will the spirit and the bride cease to echo the swelling words, "' Come!" Rena returned from the funeral more nearly broken in spirit than she had ever been before. But who has not walked beneath the shadow of a first great grief? Who has not felt the hopes and aspirations for which they had sacrificed so much, suddenly falling like molten lead upon the heart? It was all over now, everything that affection could offer, and she was compelled to awaken to the dread reality that she was motherless! Infants, who were unconscious of their great bereavement, and still smiling upon the face of the dead, have stirred up sentiments of pity in many a selfish bosom; but is there not a proportionate degree of compassion due to those who are conscious of all, and yet can only stagger beneath the force of this dreadful blow? And Rena had spurned this humble life which God had allotted her, had clamored for a loftier social position; but this great grief had, as she thought, forever demolished these gilded structures, and they had toppled to the earth. It has been remarked, that whosoever best performs the part assigned him in the great drama of life, whether that of lord or serf, is the one to receive the greatest applause.   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       109 But is this so in the world's wide circle? It most assur- edly is in the sight of Him who searches the hearts of men; but in the sight of the votaries of this world, never! How many a sordid, shameful part has been performed upon the great stage of life before a gaping audience, which met with boisterous shouts of empty applause? And yet the praise was not the fruits of a patient, worthy pertormance of the part assigned, but the bribery of gold or position that glares through the awnings of the empty scene. Is it strange, then, when she had been enabled to see this, that she still coveted a more exalted position? And yet how visible the weakness, nay even corruption, of the natural heart is made manifest in thus grappling after that which even the eye of reason cannot help seeing is perfectly counterfeit? Of what value is applause coming from the lips when the heart conceals a contempt for the weakness made so prominent in the scene? Alas! well might the Psalmist explain, "What is man that Thou art mindful of him?" Again the bleak winter passed away, and the blue-eyed violet lifted its modest head from among the autumn leaves. Rena's health was fast failing, for she made no effort to rise above the sorrow that was resting so heavily upon her. It was in vain that friends expostulated. "I don't want to forget it," was the invariable reply,; "I ask no greater earthly happiness than the sweet privilege of cherishing her merhory." It was useless to speak to her of the consolations.-of the Gospel, and not much wonder, for if she had ever in any degree understood *       ,      <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6632-00000056"/> IIO     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE these mysteries, her understanding was so clogged with. human philosophy and tradition as to leave little open- ing for the entrance of the light of simple Gospel truth. "Don't talk to me about consolation," she would an- swer mournfully. "I find none either in God or in any of his works; and more than that, I don't feel that I want any." Through the entreaties of friends she was at length -induced to abandon, for a time, these haunts, which could only administer nourishment to the melan- choly that was preying upon her; and among new and distant scenes her exhausted nature rallied to some ex- tent, while a quiet peace, but it was not the " peace of God," stole back into her heart. Her Heavenly Father was not going to lift her above the' "pilgrim's dark and thorny desert," without a well grounded assurance of "realms of endless day" at the termination of the weary way. *e   PANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.

Yet man alone to bounteous heaven Thanksgivings, conscious strains can raise; To favored man alone 'tis given To give to God his heart's deep praise." "They all seem so strange away out there, and I am afraid I shall feel more lonely than I do here at home," sighed Rena Selton, as she packed away one article after another in the great traveling trunk before her; "I have never seen cousin Nettie, and I feel just like I'd rather stay here by mother's grave." "But it will help you, Rena, I am sure, and besides you will soon feel at home among them. You have already seen Aunt Mabel and Cousin Maud. Poor girl! I'm afraid she will never be well again." "If I thought the trip would improve my health, I would be willing; but .still, life is not so desirable when all its brightness has been taken away that I need to de- sire prolongation," and she looked sorrowfully down upon    <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6632-00000057"/> II2     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE the picture of that beloved face which death had hidden from her view. "Here, you must leave this out; it goes into your basket, remember," suggested the sister. "Now hurry and pack these other things away. Stop! You'll not need that thick dress for summer wear, goosie; but stow them away in some shape, for I want you to take the baby while I attend to the evening's work." "I thought that I would take these winter dresses, too," she answered, vacantly. "I don't know where I might chance to take a notion to go before I come back -perhaps to the ' Sunny South' this winter to play the part of governess. I've nothing to draw me here now since mother's gone." "Do you suppose that you are nothing to the rest of us and to father?" asked the sister, sadly. "You talk like one from whom every chain of earth had been sev- ered." 1"Bessie, the rest of you have families that I know are much dearer to you than I am; it is natural. It makes me sad to leave my dear, aged father; but then he does not yearn for my presence as mother did." c"Rena, you are mistaken about that," was the rejoin- der. "He is remarkably anxious about you, and I have said that he loved you more than the rest of us, and I believe he does." c"That's only because he considers me his baby yet, being the last whose cradle was rocked beside this well- worn hearth-stone. I wish I could be rocked there again!"   VA4NQUISHED LIE-DREAM.     I13 "What makes you talk so, child? It is far better for you to be a woman and able to take care of yourself, the way you are situated, than to be a helpless infant." i"But it is so sweet," she answered, in a dreamy way, "to lay one's head upon a parent's bosom and know that there, at least, we have a resting place away from all life's cares and trials." She did not then know that it was infinitely sweeter to lay one's head upon the bosom of the Lord Jesus and find there not only a quiet but an eternal resting place. The rest upon the mother's breast may be, and alas! how often is, broken by disease and death, and the orphan's head thrown in contact with a buffeting and unloving world; but that surer rest can never be broken! He can never forsake nor be taken away from giving rest to his beloved, for he has said, "I will not leave you orphans, I will come unto you." The depths of another love, however deep and sacred-and we know that it is a sublime and worthy passion-can never give such rest as the assured love of Him who came to give the weary and heavy laden rest, and yet found no rest for Himself below i "Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head." How the thought of this ought to humble those who have tasted of this love when they would seek to sit be- neath "the green trees and high places" of this earth, which is still stained with the blood of Him who came to save ruined man! The heart should be stirred by emo- tions of thankfulness and joy that although He was    <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6632-00000058"/> "     LINDEN HILL; OR, TIZE deprived of these earthly comforts, still His own ones here can truly say he came , To bid the sinner live, And soothe our griefs to slumber on his breast." "What, then, am 1, my God, Permitted thus the path of peace to tread- Peace purchased by the blood Of Him who had not where to lay His head? "Oh! why should I have peace? Why? but for that unchang'd, undying love Which could not, would not cease Until it made me heir of joys above!" Such, indeed, is the love of God as revealed m Jesus, but she saw it not, for her heart in rebellion only asked, "If God loved me thus' why did He take away the most perfect resting place this world had ever given me?" "That you might lean upon Himself, poor, tired and stricken one," faith would have whispered, but she could not hear it; and the burden of grief which he would gladly have transferred to Himself she still hugged closely to her heart and bore it in sullen solitude alone! "You are getting to be real babyish, Rena," remarked the sister, after a brief silence, in which Rena had been busily engaged packing away this and that; but in her absent-minded condition she would have been just about as apt to have packed away the baby's hat or old shoes as anything else. "You must try to rally again; you used to be so self-reliant."   VANQ UISHED LIFE-DREAM.      I 5 "I could be that yet if I had anything to stimulate me," was the reply; " but I just feel like something that an early frost had blighted; I have no hopes, no aims and no ambitions." "But you will have," persisted Bessie. "The continue ation of such feelings would be unnatural." c' Give me the baby, then; I believe I have finished," was answered, as the spring of the trunk was snapped and she placed the key in her pocket, and, snatching up a bonnet, walked slowly away. Birdie walked beside her with a pitying look, for she well knew whither her steps would tend. The twilight hour was already stealing on, and still she sat beside her mother's grave, weeping tears of bitter, bitter grief. She seemed to have forgotten the flight of time, or the child that was slumbering in her arms, and did not observe the wild, frightened glances of Birdie, as, nestling closer to her side, she glanced here and there among the habita- tations of the dead. "It looks like everybody dies," murmured the child at length, as she again glanced wildly around. "It is a much sadder thing to live than to die, Birdie," answered Rena, as with the burden she arose to go, "but you are not afraid, I hope." The child gave no answer more than to cling to her dress with trembling fingers while they hastened home- ward. "Hush, my babe, lie still and slumber," sang Bessie plaintively, as she rocked the baby to and fro, sitting    <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6632-00000059"/> 1I6     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE there in the deepening twilight. Birdie had been placed in the little bed, from which was heard a low, broken sob. "What is the matter, Birdie? I thought you were asleep," she queried, drawing near the child.- "Oh! it seems like such an awful thing to die, and everybody dies," sobbed the child outright. Bessie gave a significant look toward her companion and the conversation was turned to happier themes, that it might lighten the heart of the child, who was already overshadowed with the fear of death. There is thus early an unwillingness to pass into this invisible state made manifest--a conscience, the same as that which made Adam hide from God's presence among the trees of the garden, and even now causes the unexpanded mind of childhood to shrink from meet- ing a God of infinite love! The serpent's trace has not yet been obliterated, for the same subtle voice that caused Eve to think that God was not a God of love, is still whispered by man's deadly enemy to the conscience of the unpurged sinner. And that deep, that deathless love is as readily doubted now as then. The devil's slander concerning the goodness of God is readily be- lieved, while God's openly revealed truth, and the stronger proof of that love in the death of Jesus, is as readily spurned and slighted. "Oh! will you never learn His quenchless love who came the lost to save?" Rena was soon gliding swiftly away to other scenes where warm and loving friends greeted her with open   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.        I 7 arms, and whose tender sympathies, as far as other loves could suffice, filled the vacuum in her lonely heart made by death's cruel inroads. And especially did she find in dear Aunt Sallie something more than one of the world's sunshine friends. Old and worn by the many cares that had beset her path, through God's grace, she was ever able to take up the burdens of life as they came without murmur or complaint. She had been chastened by the rod of affliction as well as sorrow, but was still ready to kiss the hand that wielded the chastening rod. But yet Aunt Salhe was not one of the world's favored ones. No, she was too true to her absent Lord for that, and yet her life was so irreproachable that it was enough to put to shame those who would dare speak harmfully of her. But as " out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh," even so her conversation would prove that her heart was filled with thoughts of Him, the knowl- edge of whose love had lifted her in spirit above the cares of life, and she could now with transport sing: "The trials of this daily life, The shadows o'er my path which fall, Had sought to hide Thy glory's light, Until I rose above it all! Calm in Thy secret presence now I'd rest this weary heart of mine; Feed on the fullnes of Thy word, And die to all the things of time! Learning Thy love-so wondrous deep, I'd live in joy and grief the same, Weeping as though I did not weep, Gaining as though I did not gain!    <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6632-00000060"/> z I8     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE Oh! take my fevered hands in thine, And keep me, Master, nearer thee, Walking above the things of time, In closest fellowship with thee! Alone with thee! O Master, where The light of earthly glory dies; Misunderstood by all, I'd dare To do what thine own heart will prize!" Such was the life of dear Aunt Sallie, who, although "seeing through a glass darkly," could yet adore the ob- ject of her heart's desire, whom she was soon to see "' face to face." And it was this that rendered her com- panionship so undesirable to many, because "her conver- sation was in heaven, from whence also she looks for the Lord Jesus." The hearts of men, according to nature, are unchanged, and are just as ready to cast out the disciple who walks as his Saviour walked as they ever were. "If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you." Cousin Nettie, although a warm-hearted, lovable little woman, was one who was overburdened with her house- hold cares and the management of her two little children, whom she always thought she must keep in a worry about. Like Rena, she had long been trying to lead a Christian life, or to "be religious," as far as their various cases and trials would permit, but they made slow pro- gress. It was a weak, a foolish expectation, for all of our "own righteousness is as but filthy rags," and we are   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       I 19 simply guilty of hypocrisy, of trying to make a show of that which we do not possess. God's commands are not, "try to do better and live religiously," but "believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved." He alone is the sinner's righteousness. It was a fatal error into which they had both fallen-one of the enemy's wiles, this seeking to drive the sinner to forms and cere- monies, instead of pointing him to Christ. The only way the sinner can "work the works of God" is by "believing on Him whom God has sent." This, we again say, is acceptable to God, and this alone. All other works are to be performed after the sinner has believed  not before. Nettie was not so confirmed a legalist as Rena, per- haps, who could with horror look down from the emi- nence of good works upon which she had been sustain- ing herself, and shudder at the thought of being thrown in contact with those who were guilty of the grosser sort of crimes. There were no indications of the Spirit of Christ being there. She could, before the great shadow of earthly care crossed her way, with the slightest provoca- tion, speak ill of her neighbor. She could covet the wealth and distinction which a world which had cast out her Savior offered; but when it came for her to be thrown in contact with the world's open sinners, such even as the Savior could not condemn, nor so much as cast at them a stone of reproach, which their guiltiness so fully de- served, she could not endure to be thus disgraced. He knew full well what the sinful nature of man was which He did not come to condemn, but to save; but she could    <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6632-00000061"/> 3,f   jLJ..I,1VL/.LI V AUZZILL; L/ Afl .1 JIj1  shrink from such with perfect horror, without so much as giving them one pitying look. But s he had not as yet seen into the depths of her own sinful self, and her proud  heart was not sufficiently humbled to acknowledge her  own insignificante. "Do you think that Cousin Maud will ever get well?" she asked, one evening, as Nettie deposited the baby in a darkened room to sleep, only to redouble her diligence in running after another little one. "I am afraid not; and, poor thing, it seems sad when her life has had so little brightness." "I must see her to-morrow; " and the morrow found her with the pale, forlorn-looking friend, walking upon the green or seated in the cool shade. "You must not get lonely, Rena dear," sighed Maud, as she brushed away a stray ringlet that had fallen upon her cheek. "I know it must be lonely here since brother married, and I, through disease, have become old and gloomy. It used to be so different." "It suits me remarkably well; everything looks so ro- mantic about here. I was just noticing that snug little cot- tage across the way, with that massive honey-suckle so nearly covering up its unpainted walls, and was thinking what a romantic little retreat it was. It looks like the homes that fancy often pictures where quiet content and uninterrupted happiness find a lodging place. Do you think its inmates find it so?" "We must call there some evening and let you judge for yourself," replied Maud, in almost a jocund tone, It's your romantic fancy that paints it thus, for I'm cer-   -" --L  ^ HaJ^ ^ A r=KIM.  121 tain there is less of romance than reality inside its walls. But I think it is wrong to indulge in romance, Rena. It only makes life the more prosaic when its dreams have passed hopelessly away." "Did you ever indulge in such pastime?" asked Rena, somewhat incredulously, for Cousin Maud seemed now a very matter-of-fact kind of person. "Who has not?" she answered, in a tremulous tone. "But it's gone-all past now. The dream was sweet, but oh, the awakening!" They both remained silent for a time, for her com- panion felt that there was a darkened chamber in the suffering one's heart into which others had no right to intrude. "Have you supposed that I was always the cold, com- mon-place being that I now appear?--that I had never known the deeper passions that are so capable of bright- ening woman's life on earth?" Rena Selton again made no reply to these queries, and even regretted that she had touched a tender cord, which seemed even now to send a thrill of pain through the sufferer's heart. "It is only a repetition of the same old story," con- tinued the speaker--" love and disappointment! We met -he was only a poor school-teacher, and without for-  tune; but we lved-deeply, truly loved/ Our union was opposed, and he went away. There was another who sought my hand about this time.  He was wealthy, and worthy too, perhaps, and my friends encouraged his suit, but I did not; I could not love him.

But then it will all be over soon; and since I have had a peep into the grave, I find it is not half so dark a place as I thought it was." There was a soft pathos in her voice and a look of submissive gentleness in her eye that filled her compan- ion's soul with pity. There were no aims, no aspirations in life before her now! As far as earthly expectations were concerned, all was a hopeless wreck. Oh! that all  whose hopes have been thus blighted could see that deeper, that holier love which flows in the bosom of the Savior of sinners! that they could only realize that these earthly loves, however deep and sacred, are as nothing when compared with His-God's deep, unchanging love for sinners! He does not love their sins, but he loves thetnselves. I do not love the wayward ways of my child, but I love him in spite of all his naughtiness. But men disregard this unfathomable love; yes, the only thing that can completely soothe their sorrow and brighten their lives, even down here, is spurned and slighted. Weeks passed on and the companions read and talked together, rambled through the quiet shadows or sat be- side the purling brook, but the hopeless dream of those earlier years was never mentioned again. The hope of its realization was passed forever, and so they left it with the buried past. But perchance it may be thought that we enter into   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       123 these little details of earthly loves and hopes more than is needful for our story. Yet even an earthly love is the only earthly thing that really gladdens the life of carnal man. Look at a loveless life and it is invariably soured and embittered. Love makes all of life's brightness, and the joy it brings we would seek to impress upon the minds of all. But it is only that we might contrast this with God's greater love. If such deep, such sacred loves can glow in the bosoms of Adam's fallen sons and daughters -the lack of which is enough to darken all life's weary way-what, we again ask, must be the depths of that love which glows in the bosom of Him who, although the Son of- Mary, was nevertheless the Son of God? "Let's take a little ride this evening," suggested Maud, as the evening shadows were lengthening upon the green sward. "My rides and walks will be lonely and few, I fear, when you are gone. Let us go to the cemetery; I want you to see where my dear father has for many years been sleeping," and they soon entered its enclosure where the friends of so many bereaved ones were sleeping their last, unbroken sleep. There was no familiar spot to Rena there, as with a cautious step she wended her way to the grave of a long-since departed relative. A plain, white slab marked the place, but how little did they realize that 'in so short a time another would be placed beside it, be- neath which poor Maud would be sleeping! "I don't see why you need go home so soon," re- marked Maud, after they had left the solemn city of the dead, and were slowly wending their way homeward. "There's nothing to call you away, I'm sure."    <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6632-00000063"/> 124     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "I have no home," answered Rena, sadly. "They say 'Tis home where'er the heart is;' but if this is true, my home, if I have one, is at the graveyard where my mother sleeps. I am sure my heart is there!"  It was but a weak, a human feeling, and not such as could fill the bosom of one who saw themselves upon the resurrection side of the Cross. The individual who has reached that point, and been permitted to stand upon the mountain hights of God's glory, can no longer desire to walk beneath the shadows that hover over the gloomy valleys below. It is a blessed privilege to stand upon those hights where ,L The laugh of pleasure, moan of pain, The vain, deluding shouts of earth May fall upon the ear in vain." And truly the Christian who is thus walking amidst the shadows of earth has never had a comprehensive view of God's grace and goodness, has never known the perfect " liberty of a child of God." "(I don't feel that I could endure the loneliness that -I should be obliged to meet at the old homestead," Rena continued, sadly, " and so I have concluded to visit some other friends away out West. I shall, perhaps, find em- ployment there, and the cause of my joyless life will not be forever before me." And in a few days they parted without dreaming that it was forever! In a short time Rena had reached and was steaming up the "Great Father of Waters," watching the objects that met her view as she glided upon its   VANOQUISHED LI E-DREAM.      25 mighty bosom, until transferred to one of its tributary streams. For two days she had been gliding smoothly onward, enjoying the society of her fellow-passengers on board, who seemed very much like a pleasant family ,group; and the morning of the third was bright and cloudless, although those on deck could feel the blight- ing force of a chilly November wind. Our young friend had just repaired to her stateroom for some trifling work with which to while away the time, feeling that the comforts the cabin offered were not to be exchanged for those outside. She had been so busily engaged as not to think of other matters, when a hurried commotion reached her ears. She threw down the trinkets with which she had been occupied to investigate the matter, and was just in time to catch a glimpse of the excited, hurrying passengers as they hastened downward, while the gentlemanly captain alone remained to see that no one was lost. "Don't be frightened, miss," he remarked, as he drew the arm of the astonished girl through that of his own and hastened forward; "I trust there will be no one lost." The steamer had caught fire during the night, which, even when discovered, was past all hopes of being ex- tinguished. She was speedily made fast, and soon after the passengers had all gone ashore, with a great explo- sion she toppled over and fell into the mighty waters. "Thank God for this deliverance!" murmured Rena, as her feet again pressed the solid earth, even while she looked around upon the cheerless scene about her. But    <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6632-00000064"/> I26     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE in her heart she only thanked the captain for his thought- ful kindness instead of Him who is the source of every preservation. All colors and conditions present were now upon one common standing out in those uncultured wilds that bordered on the river's winding course. The " sick lady " was speedily brought out of her state of helplessness, and was to be seen climbing the rugged hills enveloped in the blankets which the considerate cap- tain had wrapped about her; while the "fat old lady," who had been on to the great city to purchase goods for her western country store, was frantically offering bribes to the colored part of the crew to save her valued treas- ures. She had clung with death-like tenacity to a fellow- passenger as she crossed over the plank, fearing that an accidental tumble might immerse her in the waters be- low, although only the day before she had held quite an animated discussion with a lady passenger who happened to differ from her view, declaring that there was a saving power in the water, and that none who were not literally baptized in water could be saved. She did hot under- stand that the water baptism is only enjoined upon the saved ones, and that the " water of the Word " is but to cleanse them from the defilements with which they meet in their walk down here. Other passengers--those who but a few hours before had been considered of the lower classs-such as cooks and deck hands, were busily engaged in testing the real merits of the " good old rye" and brandy which their fidelity could never permit them to leave behind in, the bar-room of the burning wreck.

I27 A messenger was dispatched to the nearest neighbor- hood, which was at considerable distance away, and after a whole day among those rugged hills without food, and fanned by the chilly winds of November, transportation was at length obtained to carry them to the nearest point, from which Rena Selton continued her journey to her distant friends. b    <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6632-00000065"/> I28      LINDEN HILL; OR, THE CHAPTER XI. ! .

"But you must not think of going away again this evening; Nellie Clyde can just go home without you, for Benny is so much worse that I had rather you were here." Bessie was a weak, shrinking little woman, who, un- like Rena, had inherited more of their mother's timidity than the father's self-reliance. She was the senior by several years, but her vine-like nature had ever been wont to lean upon her more unyielding sister in times of trouble, and those troubles had neither been small nor few. But now that Rena had returned, somewhat resem- bling her former brave self, she might find a solace in leaning upon her in time of need. But this motherly anxiety was no idle fancy now, for the little sufferer lay   4-VANQUISKED LIFE-DREAM.     129 like some marble statue, with the shadow of death already resting upon his upturned face. He gave a wan smile of pleasant recognition as she bent over the little crib to give him the expected kiss; but, though she said nothing, her quick perceptions could clearly discern the work of the destroyer, and she knew that that little life was soon to be ended in this world. "Do you think he is going to die?" the mother asked with a troubled countenance. "I can't say, Bessie, I'm sure," she answered, thought- fully, "but he is much worse than I expected to find him." Mrs. Howard sank upon a chair beside her almost idolized child, and gave way to a hysterical burst of grief. Rena's words, though not intended to be discouraging, conveyed more than the mother's heart was prepared to endure. The babe smiled in unconscious happiness upon her, and its persuasive cooing a day before would have sent a thrill of pleasure to her heart; but now it was all dark and gloomy, and she could only stroke the curls of weeping little Birdie, her first-born darling, as they to- gether mingled their tears above the sleeping child. She knew that Rena was never hasty in forming conclusions, and then her look implied more than her tongue con- fessed. Is not a desire for human testimony a natural element of the heart? If not, why then do we so often, when in troubles or doubts about anything, seek the counsel or encouragement of friends? Why, when knowing that "all power" is in the hands of God, can we not go to 'i'        , ' .    <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6632-00000066"/> i. 1    130     LINDEN fHILL; OR, THE him, leaving the issue entirely in his hands? Why, but for a lack of faith! The night was coming on dark and gloomy, but Rena went about with seeming fortitude, arranging this and that, and trying by various arts to relieve the anguish of the little sufferer. "Hark, Bessie, I hear some one," she whispered, as the stillness of their watch was broken by the sound of approaching footsteps, and in a moment more a bronzed and bearded man made his appearance at the door. "O, it is only Philip," Bessie answered, with a smile; "he has got back from his long tramp, and said he would try to come to-night, as Benny was so very ill." A momentary thrill passed over her, but it was only for a moment, when the changed visage entered and she stood face to face with Philip Howard. The traces of early boyishness had all faded from his face, and in their stead were the sterner features of settled manhood. They exchanged a formal greeting, passing a few common- place remarks, as indifferent acquaintances might use upon a second meeting, but there was no indication of deeper feeling manifest than a mere respectful politeness would necessarily call forth. They watched together beside the suffering child, mutually consulted the best manner of promoting his comfort; and, notwithstanding that the wing of death's angel was stooping above them, the night passed speedily and pleasantly away. But it is needless to enter into detail. A few days passed away, and death claimed his victim. What an influence the presence of death wields over those with whom it    VANQUISHEIED LIFE-DREAM.     131 comes in contact! It not merely hides the many faults of those who have passed to the beyond, but it awakens all the better feelings of the surviving ones who are left behind. Philip Howard and Rena Selton stood in mute grief beside the little coffin which contained one who had been almost an idol in his narrow sphere. The wearied mother bowed her head in silent grief, and no outward demonstra- tions told of the vacuum made in her heart by the ruth- less inroads of death. Many an eye was suffused with tears and many a spirit saddened as they mused upon the brittle thread that holds our earthly happiness. But this, too, was all over at length, the little coffin left in the little grave, with the sods pressed upon it, and the crowd all passed away. The busy scenes of life went on just as before, and soon only in the immediate household was the cherished name of "Bennie" spoken with faltering voice. "Going away again! Why, I did not know you had the slightest thought of taking such a journey." Again Philip Howard and Rena Selton were seated in the shadow of the aged bough, and the sun was sinking low in the crimson west. As friends they had passed a few pleasant weeks together, but these were to be broken up now, and Rena could but feel that the breaking up of these sunny hours must bring a loneliness to her already lonely life. His friendly sympathy in her great bereave- ment, and brotherly interest in all her plans, had led her unconsciously to confide in him; and now that she had no mother to whom she could unburden her heart, is it    <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6632-00000067"/> I32     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE any wonder that she sought the sympathy of a heart that could beat responsive to her own? She did not know it was love; she only deemed it respect for one whose ,deep- toned tenderness was so combined with manly independ- ence--those elements of character so essential to the perfect man; but through her admiration of these attri- butes her soul awoke to the consciousness that with his departure life would indeed lose much that of late had served to brighten it. "Yes. My calling seems to be toward the setting sun," he answered, looking far away toward the golden sunset, "and besides, life here is too prosaic. I want something more daring, or perhaps romantic." There was a tinge of sarcasm, or perhaps bitterness, in his tone as he uttered these. words, but it passed un- heeded. "How soon do you go?" she asked, after a short silence. "-In a few days, perhaps. I am anxious to breathe the pure mountain air again. I think it will give me re- newed vigor, and the varied scenery will, perhaps, help to modify the monotonous days before me." "I can only say, God speed you," she answered :quietly. "There is, doubtless, a charm in such a life that woman, whom nature has hedged in the narrow limits of propriety, can never know." "There is a charm, most assuredly; but do these -charms satisfy the yearnings of a restless heart?" His tone was low and measured, and a shadow dim- med the lustre ot his dark, deep eye. It was evident that    VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      133 in all his wanderings he had never found that " balm of healing," even a contented mind, which had lured him on through those weary years. "But I must not dim the brightness of your life by leaving some of the shadows of my own behind," he re- marked in a rallying tone. "And I had almost forgotten that I had promised to meet a friend in the village to- night. I may not see you again, and, therefore, will bid you good-bye, and leave my best wishes with you." No word of the past had ever been uttered between them. As a sealed book it had been hidden away in some darkened chamber of their own hearts, and if truant memory ever invaded those gloomy portals, God alone was witness to the fact. "Why do you go away again so soon, Mr. Howard?" she asked, while her hand trembled in his own broad palm. "How can you ask me such a question, Rena?" he answered, in a stern, cold tone, as his eyes looked with penetrating gaze into her face. 4"Do you wish to humil- iate me a second time?" She looked into his face with a clear, candid expres- sion, and answered, "No;" but a tear fell upon her cheek, which he was not slow to detect. "For years," he continued, still holding the hand he had taken in his own, "I have tried to forget the little romance of our early lives, to crush out the hopes which I considered hopeless from my heart, but the past few    <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6632-00000068"/> I34     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE weeks have convinced me of my utter failure, and this, Rena, is why Igo!" Her head was bowed lower, but she said nothing. "I cannot meet you on the cold plane of formal friendship," he went on again, "and failing to obtain the place in your affections that my heart asked, it refuses any place at all." He dropped her hand as if it had contained the venom of a reptile, and turned away chagrined at the weakness which had again prompted him to lay bare the treasure hidden in his heart, but it was too late to retract. "Philip," she whispered, laying her hand upon his arm, "I will not deceive you; I love you." The shadow was instantly dispersed from his counten- ance, and in a transport of joy he clasped her to his bosom. What cared he for the oft-repeated assertion that she would never wed? Simply nothing; and all that before had arisen up in mountain difficulties was suddenly transformed into mere mole-hill proportions. Woman's nature, when not biased by politics or the fashionable folly of society, is readily induced to yield, to confide in the object of her affections, and who knows of this hidden power better than himself? How deplor- able, then, that so many having such imperfect under- standing of the position they occupy in God's sight, will so shamefully betray the sacred trust confided to them. "Go with me west, then, Rena," he whispered plead- ingly. "The journey would, doubtless, improve your health, and it would make it so much pleasanter for me?"   VANQUISHZED LIFE-DREAM.      I35 "And leave them all here? O, Philip, how could I?" "Couldn't you for my sake?" "Not yet," she answered earnestly, " but come back in one year,and I will go with you to the uttermost parts of the earth, if you desire it."  "If that is your decision, I will try to be content," he answered, pressing a kiss upon her burning cheek. "One thing is sure, I shall carry with me a happier heart than an hour ago I ever expected to possess again." And in a few days Philip Howard was far away on his westward journey.  <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6632-00000069"/> t36     LINDEN HiLL; OR, 7ZE CHAPTER XII. WESTWARD BOUND. "Would'st die for what we love? O, is there power In the true heart, and pride and joy for this! It is to live without the vanished light That strength is needed." It was now Rena's turn to walk in the midst of a scene out of which all the brightness had faded. Even the sun seemed to shine brighter as it seemed to near the western hills, and when the evening hours came on she would sit for hours looking out into the clear moon- light, thinking how its soft lustre must beautify the broad western plains where buffalo, elk and wild men roamed at pleasure. How often she pictured in imagination a quiet, unpretending home in those uncultivated regions, which she might beautify and adorn for Philip's sake, and where she could share his joys and help to drive away the mental gloom that might chance to stoop above his life-path. The outside gilding of the world's allurements was fast wearing off, and she was beginning to see the coarse workmanship before concealed beneath the tintings of art; in fact, a shallow, empty farce, the whole struggle for name and position, and her tired heart was glad to   ANQ UISzED LIFE-DREAM.      137 find something more satisfying in which it could rest. But this was only a human and not a divine rest-a rest that could never perfectly satisfy the soul that was formed for Eternity any more than fame or wealth. It, doubt- less, gives less room for ambitious yearning; but the mind expands as it receives the things of earth, and the soul's insatiate cry is ever for " more, more." And the vanquished dream would return again; it was only for the time kept down by the other passions of the soul. "Vanity of vanities," she murmured, throwing aside a fashionable magazine and resuming the work that had for a time been lying unheeded upon her lap; "this fashionable slavery seen and read about everywhere! I'm perfectly disgusted with it all, and really wish I had gone with Philip where I could have seen something true to nature, if it was nothing more than the untutored sav- age. Even in 'first-class society' there is so much coun- terfeit used, and so little genuine coin in circulation, and I wonder that every one who has a thimbleful of brains can't see it. It may be my own stupidity of late; but I honestly believe there might be more real happiness found in a wildwood cabin than all this empty, fashiona- ble folly can produce." She again dropped the work and leaned her head wearily upon her hand as if herself tired of the dissipa- tions of which she had ever taken but little part; but it was a new phase in life for her, this giving up the hopes of the world's approbation for a place unknown and un- honored by it-an idea which she would have utterly spurned in the years gone by. And now, when her pen 9    <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6632-00000070"/> 138      LINDEN HILL; OR, THE had attracted the attention of many, and the realization of her life-dream seemed almost within her reach, was she going, in that moment of blind infatuation, to cast it all aside? But this was only a little oasis which she had reached in life's desert journey-a delightful rest for the time; but, however much she might wish to loiter, there was many a burning sand to press before she reached the green pastures of peace beyond. Throwing the work aside, upon which she had made but little progress, and taking up her pen she hastily transcribed these words, which were welling up into her mind: O keep me, gracious Father kind, From envy's snares, ambition's strife, Which cluster round the aspirant's mind And shroud his way with sorrows rife.

"That's just what I want," she soliloquized, reading the lines a second time.  "I want to be kept from   a desire for these things, for there is something within me, try hard as I may to resist, which reaches out after these delusions, even when in my heart I know that I despise them." How little she knew of the two natures of which the Christian is in possession.

Has not God told us that " that which is born of the flesh is flesh," and can never be changed any more than the "Ethiopian's skin or the leopard's spots?" It is most true that the lusts should be mortified; but why?  Because our Adam nature ends when we are born of God by faith in Christ-not that we do not feel its warfare within us, but God does not see us in that nature which he condemned at the Cross, having before proved it to be utterly incapable of doing any. good thing. "A corrupt tree can not bring-forth good fruit;" therefore, it is utterly useless to hope to gather " figs from brambles." But the hardest part of this is to believe that fallen man is utterly corrupt-that he is not capable of do- ing some good things, or having some good thoughts. My readers, " out of the hearts of men are the issues of life." And what is that heart? It is " deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked." No wonder, then, that we do not realize our evil. The heart deceives us-would fain make us believe that there were unselfish motives in -the breast; and outwardly " blinded by the god of this world, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of the Son of God should shine into our hearts," we move blindly on. It would, and does, make a fearful revelation by shining there; there are dark thoughts and selfish motives which even the possessor does not know he possesses until re- vealed by that wondrous light.

Yet Rena Selton, who prided in her human wisdom, understood none of these simple truths; but the wisdom of this world is foolishness when compared with the weakest things of God. She longed to rise above the vanities of time-to walk in commu- nion and fellowship with Him above the troubled waters of this life, but was uselessly dreaming of becoming more holy, more suitable for his companionship, instead of leaving condemned self where God leaves it, in the place of death, and in the power of the spirit launching boldly forth. "Here are some letters for you, Rena," her sister re- marked, entering the room unperceived and throwing the welcome missives on the table beside her. Here is an interesting looking one; what would you give me for it?" Rena glanced at the postmark and a faint color tinged her cheek, but she laid it aside and deliberately tore open those of less importance and scanned their contents. When again left alone, however, she eagerly read the welcome epistle that was more than meat or drink to her hungry heart. "  Oh! how much I should like to be there!" she mur- mured audibly, while her eye gazed into the distance as if she might really feast her vision upon the beautiful scenery her fancy pictured. "I believe I could be truly happy there; " and turning to the letter she again read: "I am taking notes to-day high up among the Rocky Mountains.

I would like to give you a pen- picture of the lovely scenery around me here, but lan- guage fails when I attempt to describe the beauty of the landscape that now lies outspread before me. It is a picture of wild sublimity-one of which the eye would not readily tire. The huge mountain summits rise cold and formidable above me, their white crests strikingly con- trasting with the green valleys below, and the icy waters which rush with such impetuosity down these mountain gorges seem as if trying to strike with terror the hearts of the beholders. We look down upon the city of  ^ nestled in the valley below, and although it is many weary miles away, it looks to be almost within a stone's throw of this place, so winding and deceiving is the ascent of these mountain defiles. Gorgeous flowers grow in wild profusion along these rugged haunts, the most beautiful of which, to smy fancy, is the cactus. I wish you could see its brilliant clusters of flowers, and am sure that you, much better than myself, could appreciate its loveliness. But I have employed myself part of the time (it's no harm to do such things on Sunday up here in the mountains, and you'll get them on a week day,) in carefully taking some of these from their life-long homes and depositing them in a box, which I intend to send to you, that you may have a faint idea, at leasti of their loveliness. "There is a kind of moss or ivy which grows pro- fusely here, a sort of covering which Nature uses to cover up the rugged deformities of these 'everlasting   -i -   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      143 hills;' and it succeeds admirably, for the smaller rents and chasms are by this means made attractive, which otherwise would be unsightly in the extreme. "Of the animals-I fear I shall be unable to interest you on this point, as my descriptive powers are not good in this branch of science. There are many kinds, vary- ing in size from the noisy little ' prairie dog' to the beaded and plumed monarch of these prairies; and I do not know which are more numerous of the classes mentioned, for we frequently during our journey were startled by the bark- ing of whole villages of these ptppies, and perhaps as often encountered whole caravans of these savage rang- ers. As a general thing, these Indians are a low, de- graded people, although we sometimes see a chieftain wearing a real military bearing; and these 'dark-eyed daughters of the sun, are, some of them, decidedly hand- some--almost equal to 'the girls we left behind' us. But, upon the whole, although the scenery is surpassing lovely, the sights have only served as a kind of recreation, something to break in upon the monotony of this long, tedious journey, and that is all. "If these Western plains could only be aroused by the locomotive's shrill whistle, then the journey would be but an idle pastime; but we must wait the march of pro- gress." "I don't believe he thinks it a suitable place for me to live," murmured Rena, as she folded up the letter and placed it in its hiding-place near her heart.

She took up the neglected sewing, and her fingers were soon busily engaged, but they could not keep pace with the thoughts that were running with headlong speed over the past and future. There was plenty of work to do; but how could she prevent her thoughts from running away from the formidable task before her? "Any good news?" asked a voice, through the open door. "I'm going to read those letters soon as baby goes to sleep." But baby had not much notion of going to sleep, for she reached out her dimpled hand, and climbing from her mother's knee toddled across the floor, where, getting possession of grandpa's staff, she played horse around the room, to the no little annoyance of all present. "May I read this?" she continued, taking a letter from the table and drawing it from the envelop. "I'm sure ] don't care," was the nonchalant rejoinder. "Richard Wentworth! Bah!  I thought you had dropped him long ago." "Richard is a dear, good fellow, I'm sure, and I shall always respect him," remarked Rena. '"Besides, this is only a business letter, as you will see, if you will take the pains to read it." "Doubtless," was the sober answer. "But here is an- other business letter-a dropped one. I see that you do not care for me reading these, so I don't care anything about it. But where is the other? Oh! you need not hide it, for your hiding only proves how much you value it."   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       145 There was no reply given, for Rena well knew that Philip's letters had never been subjected to the inspec- tion of any one but herself. She had never cared for the others; but this was something different-in what re- spect she did not even ask herself. "Come,.pet; now put away grandpa's staff, and let's go and see the birdies," she whispered, taking the child in her arms, whose bright eyes danced with pleasure at the thought of the proposed ramble. "Away we go, now." And away they went across the old orchard, ripe with the rich fruits of autumn, the little prattler's voice rival- ing the music of the birds which caroled among the trees. Those bright autumn days were passing swiftly away, the last Rena would ever pass among those haunts of her childhood. But how filled with sacred memories every spot now appeared! The old schoolhouse, with its ample playground; the brook, whose silvery water wended past the "big tree," where, with rustic playmates, she had held many a childish tryst; and just beyond was the quiet graveyard, with its marble slabs glistening in the sunlight, where a faithful mother slept that " last, long sleep!" And last, but not least, was the thought of leaving a much loved father, whose iron will had been much subdued by the weight of years and sorrow, and whose flickering life-lamp she felt was soon to be absorbed by the quenchless light of Eternity. 1    <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6632-00000074"/> "6     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE CHAPTER XIII. WEDDED. "Thy spirit through the lonely night, From earthly joys apart, Hath sigh'd for one that's far away- The bridegroom of thy heart." It is needless to go into the details of all those weari- some days, or how, with yearning desire, Rena waited her betrothed's return. But lonely and lingering as the time might seem, it was cheered by hopeful expectations, without which it would have been almost unendurable. "Hope deferred maketh the heart sick;" but faith in an absent one can still live on, counting upon the fulfill- ment of these hopes, however long the patience may be tried. And is there not in this a shadow of the Bride- the Church-waiting here below in this world of care for Christ, her heavenly Bridegroom, to come and take her to himself?"The Spirit and the Bride say come," and if she is true to the love of Him who, when He looked through the hidden mysteries of eternity and saw that "Pearl of great price," did not shrink from the dark waters of death, but gave up all that he had, even the glory which he had with the Father, to purchase it at such wondrous cost, will not her heart yearn for him to   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      147 come again and take her to the mansions prepared for her in that Father's house?

But it may be asked, Does every member of that heavenly body long for his return? We answer, No. Is every bride true to her absent husband? And does she not cease to respect his absence in proportion as she is occupied with the business plans or frivolities with which she is surrounded? The yearning cry of " come " is not the breathings of the old nature, orflesh, as termed in the Scripture, but of the new-that nature which is allied to God, who is the source of it. It is not that those, if really regenerated souls, in whose hearts this cry is not felt, are not shel- tered from the wrath to come; but the Spirit is grieved, its voice stifled by the rubbish of this world, and instead of the "living waters" springing up to yield refreshment, the possessor of this wondrous well walks parched and thirsty through this life's barren journey. Alas! how many are thus walking, groping onward with enough of God's spiritual light to convince them of their sinfulness but not enough to reveal God's perfect love and lift them up into the enjoyment of his favor. Rena could scarcely be said to have lived in the pres- ent as she passed through these months, for prospective happiness was the stimulant upon which her nervous fan-    <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6632-00000075"/> "8     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE cies invariably fed. She had been duly apprised of Philip's expected return, and the distance across those wide, sandy plains seemed perceptibly dimininished as she looked for his coming. "Rena, Rena," shouted a voice, as she one evening sauntered slowly across the meadow wrapped in the dreamy cogitations of her own mind. "Why don't you come on? supper has been ready for the last half hour." She quickened her pace with an indifferent grace, which soon brought her to the old farm-house. "I can't see what in the world ails you," continued the speaker; " you mope about like 'this world was a wilderness wide' and you had no desire to be at home in it." A faint smile was the only reply, as Rena sipped her tea in silence. "What do you think, Rena?" her companion went on to say. "Peter Jones and his wife have parted. I'll declare it looks like there was nothing but fussing among married people. If I were a girl I'd be afraid to ven- ture upon the 'matrimonial sea,' I'm certain." "What was the difficulty between them?" was asked, without much interest being manifest, however. "O, nothing new, I believe; one of their old spats got up, and both were determined to have the last word!" "I should think," smiled Rena," that they might have mutually agreed to that, and both have given their last word and then hushed." "Ah! but there was the trouble. He was not willing   VANVQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      149 to grant her equal rights with himself in this last word business, and undertook to enforce silence. I guess the marks on her face show that she came out number two in the conflict," "The heathen," muttered Rena, with a look of dis- gust. "What can such people live for?" "I can't see either," was the reply, " but such troubles are not confined to the lower circles-the heathen part of the community, as you are wont to term them. Look at Ettie Newman." "don't blame her," was the emphatic rejoinder. "I'd never be held in such complete subjection to any man as that." "Then you'd better never get married." "Do you suppose," she continued, with animation, "that because I became a wife I must necessarily lose my own individuality? Never! I should endeavor to faithfully perform my duty as a wife; but to give up my own will and be merely a part of the household imple- ments, subject to his sovereign wishes-that I will never do!" "That-which is born of the flesh is flesh," was clearly portrayed in her character. With all the depth of love which her nature was capable of realizing, the old stern self stood out prominently visible, overshadowing many of the more lovable qualities that tend to beautify woman. She did not see herself in relation to the hus- band of her choice as " bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh;" but as a joint partner in business transactions,    <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6632-00000076"/> 15     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE equal with himself. She saw in the husband and wife no beautiful type of Christ and the Church, His heavenly Bride. No shadowy representation in the " deep sleep which fell upon man" of the sleep of death through which the Savior passed! A rib was taken from the side of man, out of which an earthly bride was formed; b ut from the pierced side of the Son of God gushed forth a crimson stream, which cleansed the heaverly Bride and brought her into the closest relationship with Himself. When man walked in unfallen innocence through Eden's bowers, God deemed it "not good that man should be alone." He, therefore, withdrew a part of his own self, even near his heart, that there might be a vacuum there. It has been beautifully remarked that woman was taken from man's side, that she might be equal with him; she was taken from beneath his arm, that he might shelter and protect her; and she was taken from near his heart, that he might love and cherish her. But how many, alas! as well as our young heroine, lose all the beauty that this lovely picture shadows forth. How many fail to see that "c the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the Church;" not that he is thereby privi- leged to domineer over or crush his frail victim beneath a tyrant's foot, but that he minght " love and cherish her, even as Christ loved the Church and gave himself for it." The head may speak the governing words, but the heart often wields a greater influence over those reasoning faculties than many dream of. Adam's fall was not through the head's failure, but by the more seductive in- fluence of the heart. The womarn was deceived; the   VAINQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      151 man, though not beguiled, was drawn by those inward affections, and thereby ate and fell. Yet Rena had many a trial to undergo before she could acknowledge this. "The husband the head  Bah!" was her mental ejaculation. "If twain are orne flesh, I can't see why she is not as much head as he is." Ah! there are many things which you cannot see, Rena Selton, which are, nevertheless, true! The natural body and head are one flesh, and yet all is not the head; But the neighborhood gossip had completely driven away the " blues," and Rena went about singing snatches of song as innocently as if her will had not a moment before rebelled at the very tlought of opposition. "He leadeth me, he leadeth me, By his own hand he leadeth me," she caroled, leaning her head against the casement of the open window, hich was mantled with its wild pro- fusion of clinging vines, enlivened at present by a jubilee among the " katy-dids," as the twilight deepened around her. "What! not under the shadow this lovely night?" asked a voice from without, as the vines were pushed gently aside. She sprang lightly from her seat, for she had no thought of any one being near, neither did she realize that there was One leading her in the paths which she knew not. "Why, Philip Howard!" she exclaimed, "I was not dreaming of seeingyotu to-night." "I am sorry to hear that," he answered, kissing the    <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6632-00000077"/> 152     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE cheek that was willingly submitted to his caress, "for I'm sure that you have ever occupied a prominent place in my day as well as my night dreams." O, well, I'm just as glad to see you as if I had been looking for you," she returned; "but how is it that you came sooner than you said we might expect you?" "I made better time than I expected, and then I thought I would give you a little surprise," he answered; "but I did not expect to find you so absorbed in some new dream as to quite forget my existence." "You would not wonder at it, if you had heard her talking a little while ago," remarked her sister, coming forward to meet the returned wanderer. "I declare I did not know but she was going to take the Editorial Department in a 'Woman's Rights Journal.' "Fie! Rena; you don't touch on that discordant harp-string yet, do you?"Philip asked as he seated him- self at the open window beside her." "Not often, for it excites every true womanly instinct of my nature whenever I get to thinking about it," she answered laughingly, "and then I feel nervous and good- for-nothing afterward." "Rather say unwomanly sentiments," remarked Philip pleasantly, "if I could be induced to believe you pos- sessed such attributes." "Well, don't go into the subject too far," she con- tinued with a wave of the hand. "It is a theme I don't like to trust myself upon, and I don't want to quarrel with you just so soon as you get home."   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       53 The evening passed pleasantly away to all, while list- ening to the thrilling narrations of those western travels. "I took notes of all these incidents for a long time," he remarked; " but in a wild chase I accidentally lost my memorandum, and with it many a reminiscence of the past. But I presume the world will be just as wise with- out it; so there was no great mischief done." O, I'm so sorry!" she murmured. "It would have been good material out of which to weave a romance, and you. know that I live in the imaginary more than the real." "But the real is far more satisfying, little one," was whispered, tenderly. "What sandy foundations upon which to build one's happiness are these air castles in which you delight so much." "Why, Philip, how commonplace you are!" she ani swered, archly. Life would be unendurable with me if it was not for day-dreaming." "And don't you know that these dreams can never bring you happiness, Rena?" he asked. "At a distance they all wear a gilding, of which they would be utterly destitute if brought near. 'Distance lends enchantment;' but I thought that you had learned to accept life as it is -to be content with the little or much that it offers out- side of the world's gilded dream." He spoke with earnestness, and she felt the implied reproof. "Well, sometimes I am," was responded, and a sigh involuntarily escaped her lips. "But 'tis all but a dream at the best, And when happiness soonest is o'er, Yet e'en in a dream to be blest Is so sweet that I ask for no more!"

"But how can you battle with life's realities if you only live in the ideal?" There was no answer to this interrogatory, for she felt only too sensibly her lack of qualification for battling with the sterner realities of life. It is true her life had been characterized by firmness, but that is not the most essential principle for promoting conjugal felicity; and if her disposition had any worthy traits, her own unwearied exertions, overruled by an Almighty power, had directed the chisel marks in sculpturing out her character. Her own unwavering ambition ha d never really given up the goal in view; but heretofore she had lived for self, and this setting aside one's own wishes in any degree and living for-others was a new feature in the selfish drama of life. Pride and ambition can buoy up the soul for almost any trial- "Can stand upon a rock And feel the tempest beat, Gird on the cold armor of pride, While love lies bleeding at the feet-" if only self is the recipient of the bounty that hope holds forth; but only put this same self into the background and the picture wears a far less dazzling appearance. It may be beautifully portrayed in romance-this self-sacri- ficing love, this adoration that enables one to forget their own joys and sorrows in seeking to promote the happi- ness of those they love-but do the selfish masses of human witnesses prove it? It is most blessedly true   VAN QUISESy-D LI E-DREAM.     155 that God's grace can subdue the selfish heart, so that the individual who has been quickened by that heavenly power may walk in the footsteps of Him who " came not to do His own will," but the will of the Father who sent Him; yet it is only by grace he can or does do so. In'the sweet enchantment of " love's young dream " the deluded soul is prone to imagine that he can walk in his own strength, and even forgetse/ffor her he loves; but alas! how universally he fails; and the bewildered soul is forced to acknowledge that he knew nothing ot his own heart. And Rena had too often observed this failure, although she knew nothing of the heavenly antidote whereby it might be prevented, even before she stood at the altar, only a few weeks later, and, with faltering tongue, but loving heart, became the wife of Philip Howard! Together they willingly embarked upon the broad sea of life, vainly imagining that for them the storms were all past, the an- gry storm clouds rolled away, and that the clear sunlight of an earthly happiness would forever beam upon them! Such is youth's fanaticism! But why should these things not be so? Life alone and unloved could not be one of happy contentment, even through possessed of an Inca's gold. The heart yearns for companionship as naturally as the lonely stream seeks the bosom of the mighty ocean. Truly, this otughmt to be a time of unclouded bliss. Will there be aught but joy when the heavenly Bride- groom descends to meet His Bride in the air and convey her to the mansion He   has gone to prepare in the Father's house?  Will there be a single doubt, a single fear as to the love of that blessed One, or the perfect    <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6632-00000079"/> 156     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE bliss of that bright abode? Who for a moment would dare to think so? Then, as a type of this union, should not the newly-wedded ones of earth enter joyfully upon this new era and then go on brightening as the years glide by? Rena stepped into the carriage that was waiting at the door, and soon was speeding away from the haunts which she had alternately despised and revered. She felt that the die was cast, and whatever of grief or joy might be in store for future years, the clain could not be broken. "You will always be kind to me, Philip, won't you?" she asked, [placing her hand m his and leaning back wearily among the cushions like a hopeful child. "How could I be otherwise?" he answered, in a tone of tenderness sufficient to quiet every apprehension that might have oppressed her heart. "I would be less than man to prove false to so sacred a trust;" and he kissed the hand that lay so confidingly in his own. He felt the weight of a new responsibility resting upon him; in fact, through no part of his life had he ever appreciated self so much, or prided so much in the strength of an unsul- lied manhood. The true place assigned to each at that hour was realized-the husband's position as guardian and protector; the wife's, of reverence and trusting love I   VANQ UISHED LzFE-DREAM  . 5A7 CHAPTER XIV. THE NEW HOME. Strive In offices of love how we may lighten Each other's burdens. --Milton. The apple trees were again in bloom, for the chilling winter had at length passed away, and again the earth was dressed in her robes of green, while the birds sang blithely among the trees, as if this were not a groaning . world waiting to be delivered from the bondage of cor- . ruption. Rena Howard flitted to and fro through that white cottage, her bridal home, apparently gay and joyous as the feathered songsters that sang so fearlessly about her door. It was a lovely day in spring when she entered upon this new life-a day that seemed to foretell happi- ness beyond. There was plenty of work to do-furniture to arrange, curtains to hang, and the numerous finishing touches to give here and there which woman alone knows how to give. But amid all the hurry and bustle of the occasion her busy thoughts, as usual, more than kept pace with her flying feet, as she planned what she was going to do in days to come. There was a rare bit    <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6632-00000080"/> I58     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE of furniture which she felt that Philip could not afford to buy, and yet she wanted it. Could she not devise some plan, something through her own exertion, by which she might obtain it? And then there were Hthe books, some splendid new works just out, and she really wanted them badly; but they could not afford so many things. She must earn something herself, independent of her husband. Had she not for many years depended solely upon her own resources, and could she not do so yet? But she submitted none of these schemes to her husband's judg- ment, but zealously kept her own counsel. Yet it was a bright, a cheerful little home; but "O'er life's path, tho' strewn with roses, There too thorns spring wild and free; " so, in the course of time, thorns were destined to make their appearance. There were, however, none visible new. "O, this is so delightful, and not the irksome task I always supposed housekeeping would be," she ejaculated, slipping her hand in his in a child-like manner. "In fact, I feel royal as a queen and ' monarch of all I sur- vey.' "I am very glad that you find it so pleasant," was the smiling rejoinder; " but if you don't mind you'll tire yourself so much that the enchantment attached to your schemes of improved housekeeping will speedily dis- appear." "I don't feel like I should ever get tired," she an- swered with a radiant face. "I know I should not if you would always stay and help me."   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      159 "But you know that would be impossible, attractive as you are making this bird's-nest home of ours," he an- swered, as he seated her on the settee beside himself. "My business must not be neglected, for I feel the need of close attention to it now more than I ever did before. But you can find companionship in the birds, books and flowers when I am away ; can't you?" "O, I shall find work enough to keep me busy for some time yet, and then I really like to be alone some- times. There is no one then to interrupt my own thoughts." Philip smiled very faintly in reply to this, for he rightly feared that so much living in the imaginary could but destroy the happiness of that which was real. liven the brightest scenes of actual life are coarse in comparison to the gilded pictures of fancy. Is it any wonder, then, that he who indulges in these deluding dreams of an ex- cited brain should become dissatisfied with the homelier scenes in connection with his daily avocations? And we are fully aware that this evil is but imperfectly com- prehended, even in this enlightened age, when the reli- gious (?) world is so busy in trying to preach down the numerous crimes of a more open nature. It is no un- common thing to hear novel-reading, and its kindred vices of an alluring nature, denounced in the strongest terms as having a baneful influence upon the rising members of society. And truly it is an evil that should be carefully guarded against--one that may cast a blithing influence upon the after-life of many a promising youth ; but, at the same time, we believe that these extravagant habits of    <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6632-00000081"/> 160     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE day-dreaming are capable of wielding a more injurious effect over the minds of many than all of these popularly- termed "amusements" combined. In this case there is no limit to the wild flights of the vain imagination, to the extravagant hopes and expectations which are ever keeping a strain upon the nervous system, and quicken- ing the action of an already over-active brain. It is the plain duty of Christian parents, and especially of the Christian mother, to whom a greater share of training is entrusted than to any one beside, to guard against this pernicious habit. The wild plans and speculations, with the hopes that accompany them, should be duly re- pressed, and the mind fortified against these things by useful employment and profitable instruction. It is only too true, as has been remarked by others, that the popu- lar amusements, such as novels, cards and croquet, can never be preached or scolded down, and neither shall we attempt it. Those who are of the world-the unregene- rate-can, of course, have nothing better than the world's amusements to enjoy; but for the Christian is there not a certain line of reserve beyond which they should not allow themselves to be carried?-a certain (" moderation which should be known to all men?"Not a legal senti- ment which would fear this or that violation of the ac- knowledged rules of Christianity; for the individual with heart going out after these things, who is asking, "Can I do this or go there with impunity?" knows nothing of the glorious liberty into which the child of God is called. He is still in servitude, if not under the dominion of Satan; he is writhing beneath the bondages of the law,   VA NQ UISHED LIFE-DREAM.      16 I not realizing that if "' the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed." If the affections be true to that absent One, whose heart even now in glory yearns over His own down here below, in a world that cast Him out, will he desire to go where He never went, to partake of the wine of earthly enjoyment when He ever abstemi- ously refused to taste it? There are no rules or regulations laid down by man that should govern any individual, aside from the laws of one's country or place, for all should '; be in subjection to the powers that be." It is the plain precepts of God's word, as carried home to the heart by the Spirit, which alone ought to govern the Christian's life, independent of the creeds laid down by priest or clergy. "Consistency is a jewel;" but can the world see much consistency when the Christian sings, "Jesus, thou art enough The mind and heart to fill," and yet spends half his time in the world's amusements? If the lips speak one thing and the life exhibits just the reverse, wherein is the consistency made manifest? Alas I no where! But- you will say, " the Christian is under obligation to do or not to do so and so. Are there no obligations incumbent upon the world in general? Have you no charity for a world that you say is under con- demnation for having rejected and crucified the Son of God?"To this we say, that the unconverted are not unlder obligation to waZl4. as Christians when they are not Christians.

The world is not under condemnation (or judgment, as John declares it), because it does not walk orderly. The Jews were the most religious and orderly people upon the earth, and yet they crucified God in the person of His Son! The judgment of the unconverted consists in the fact that "light is come into the world, and yet men choose darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil." Will it profit anything to whiten the sepulchres which are filled with corruption? Again, we say, that the world's responsibility consists in not believing upon the Lord yesus Christ. Not merely a theoretical belief, for such belief many have who, alas! are lost; but a belief which will trust in Him, letting go all other holds, and can joyfully look up in full assurance that "His blood cleanses from all sin;" and that when he said "It is finished," there remained no more to be done! Such, verily, is the world's obligations, and not to seek to "walk as children of the day," when they are " children of the night and of darkness," for this is one of the enemy's delusions! The very simplicity of this truth makes it difficult for men to receive it, and as very, very many of this world's wise ones, with all their boasted intelligence, have never seen it thus, is it any wonder that our humble friend, whom we have been following through the pre- vious chapter, should not have understood these things? "O, my!" she ejaculated, withdrawing her hand from her husband's clasp, who had been sitting for a time in meditative silence. "I wanted to finish this room before   VA NQrUISHED LIFE-DREAM.     1 63 supper, and see how I have been loitering through 'fairy- land,' and almost forgotten all about it." "Can't it be done to-morrow just as well?" was asked. "It is already quite comfortable, and I'm sure that you are already fatigued enough to need rest. Come, let us go into the orchard; the perfume of the apple-blossoms smells delightful." He drew her hand through his arm and almost forced her away from the unfinished task, where, refreshed by the soft breath of spring, she soon forgot all fatigue or responsibility wlhich had beset her upon this the first day of housekeeping. "Look!" said Philip, pointing toward the extensive view beyond. ': Isn't that landscape lovely? It does seem to me that Eden could not have been any more beautiful when Adam and Eve became joint monarchs of its flowers and shadows than these delightful haunts of ours; -and I'm sure that Adam could not have been a happier man than myself with the Eve which God has given me." "But they were unfallen creatures then, Philip, while we, alas! feel the sad effects of the fall. The picture, however, is a most lovely one, and I am sure that I shall not readily tire of looking at it." "See the houses, so far in the distance that they look like little white specks when the sun shines upon upon them, and that dark strip of woodland intervening," he continued. "I wonder that I never saw so much beauty attached, to all this before." "It may be slightly gilded with a borrowed light," it    <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6632-00000083"/> 164     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE smiled Rena, as she turned away from the picture they had been contemplating. "A light from the heart may help to beautify it. God grant that it may never fail to shed a halo over all of life's uneven wavs." It was something like their old courtship days, only so much happier, for the hopeful dreams that then beset their hearts had verged into a settled, peaceful reality; and no wonder they were happy for the time, as they sought to enjoy the lovely out-door scenery and the rest of their own tired hearts. But again we must say, that it was only a human rest- a rest that the many conflicting cares of life might in a moment break. Yet we should ever be thankful for these little fertile spots in life's great barren journey, for the sunshine of an earthly happiness should never be lightly esteemed. But how infinitely more precious the happi- ness flowing from a heart at peace with God-a peace which the world knows nothing of. "Philip, don't you know that we are trespassing upon tea-time?" she asked, turning toward the house. "Let us go in, for you know that we have a life-time befdre us in which to contemplate this loveliness." "Yes; this is only the beginning, and may the end be far in the distance and bright as at the first," was the re- sponse of a heart full of happiness and content with the realities of actual life. "What an admirable cook as well as housekeeper you are proving to be," he remarked, as they jovially sipped their tea, for "hunger is a good sauce," and Philip's physical exertions had rendered him fully able to relish his meal.   VAVNQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      165 Rena did not know that the compliment was illy founded, until after years convinced her that her knowl- edge of the duties belonging to the culinary department had been sadly forgotten since her mother's teachings. "This tea is delicious. I declare I believe that I am going to be happily disappointed, for I did not expect to find you such a 'help-meet,' so far as domestic affairs were concerned; but I imagine you are going to excel many of far greater pretensions." "You are an expert at flattery, Phil," she answered archly; " but I'll be more honest than you, and say that I did not expect perfection when I married you, and don't expect to be disappointed either." He laughed gaily at this thrust, and rather enjoyed it; it was so much like the self-willed Rena of the past. "Then I suppose you will never complain at my short- comings, which will make it all the better for me,;" was answered, as he passed his cup a second time. "I don't like this ' best-foot foremost' way of living, anyhow." "; O, but it is best to have no worst foot at all," she answered. "You know that I never believed in a ' face for home and one for the street.'" "I know it," he replied, soberly, " and I always con- sidered it the most worthy trait in your character. If there is anything on earth that I dislike it is this ' putting on' for the sake of effect."

The evening meal was past, and Rena with deft fin- gers removed the snowy cloth from the table and set the tea things snugly away, chatting gaily all the while, as' the mellow twilight hour began to steal upon them. They were no longer children now, but there seemed a kind of awkward embarrassment as they viewed them- selves in the light of their new responsibilities-as heads of their own house. "This is a lovely evening," remarked Philip, as he seated himself by her side, where the moonbeams were already flooding the doorway. "Yes; it seems like some of the moonlit nights of long ago," was the pleasant rejoinder. "With this difference : that what was then dreamed of is now realized," was interposed. "But there is an ecstatic bliss attached to those early dreams, nevertheless, Philip-a little elysium of joy which I doubt ever belonging to life again." "That is true, Rena; but would you be willing to go back to those years in search of happiness?" "No," was the thoughtful reply, after a momentary silence. "It is sweet to know that we,-have a home all our own now, after having realized the 'ups and downs' of life for so many years. This, together with an assur- ance of your love and protection, is what gives me rest to-night, although my limbs are tired with the toils of the day."

"I was in an awful hurry, but I thought I would run in a moment, any way," ejaculated Nellie Clyde, as she rushed into the room without the least ceremony. "I felt so sorry for you in your troubles, and then it looked so selfish in me to stay away." "My troubles!" queried Rena, somewhat astonished. "I don't know what you mean; but then I'm glad to have you come, if it was through mistaken pity. "I don't blame you for trying to hide these things," exclaimed the girl, with a mischievous twinkle; "I would if I were in your place. It does not concern others, I know, but then one can't help thinking how dreadful it must be to be married to a man you care nothing for." "What dto you mean?" asked Rena, growing more and more puzzled with her strange remarks. "Why do you suppose that I should be unhappy?" "Because you don't love your husband, of course," was the rejoinder. "You said yourself that there was no such thing as love, and one would naturally suppose you were miserable under such circumstances." "Acknowledge that you are vanquished, Rena," said Philip, laughing. . Nellie has been hoarding up some of those random speeches of yours to use against ,you. I think she has the best ground at present, and you had as well give up."

"I'm not going to fret much about them, no matter how real they might be, for I'm too tired and sleepy. I danced all night last night, and now I feel tired enough for a good, quiet snooze!" "What a wicked girl you are! Don't you know that it's wrong to go to dances?" "Would it make me any better not to go?" asked the visitor, carelessly. "You might become better. We are called upon to 'break off our sins by righteousness and our iniquity by turning unto the Lord.'" "Don't preach such stuff to me," was the reply. "It all sounds like nonsense." And it was really such, and only proved the ignorance of her blind instruction. It was spiritual life Nellie Clyde needed, and not reformation. Would avoiding this or that, or the breaking off of some outward sin impart this life? Never! But such a command was given, and what was it for if we have no power to obey it? It was to Israel, God's chosen and redeemed people, that these words were spoken. Egypt's chains of slavery had already been broken from them, and they were no longer bondsmen.  And the Christian of to-day is called to "break off the sins " into which he may have fallen by righteousness and to return unto the Lord. He has power to do this, for the new life in his soul gives him the power; but God never tells the unregenerate to   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      169  "break off his sins," but to "believe on the Lord Jesus" and receive eternal life. "Well, you look rather cozy here, after all," remarked Nellie, after she had taken the liberty to look into every nook and corner to see if everything was just where it should be. "I always thought that you were too roman- tic to come down to the simple realities of housekeep- ing; but I see you have." "There seems to be a touch of romance even in these homely duties," answered Rena, lightly. "Our whole lives are composed of romance, if we would look at it in that light." "Rena Howard, I don't believe you'll ever get too old to be a simpleton," was the straightforward rejoinder. "I'd like to know what romance there is in patching clothes and washing dishes!" "It's only because you look on the practical side of these things, Nellie, and I look on the romantic. Many  a heroine has gone on uncomplainingly in the discharge  ot these humble services, and the infatuated reader has been carried away in admiration of her faithfulness. Why can't we just as well bring these things home and apply them to ourselves?"  "Such bosh!" 'replied Nellie, impatiently. "If I were  in Phil's place I'd send you to an insane asylum, and next time try and get a sane wife with a few practical,  common-sense ideas. I like substantials!" "All right; you may hang up the homely picture of  practical life in your house, and 'll hang up the brighter one in mine."

The individual who is occupied with the ideal perfections pictured out by romance is illy fitted to meet the imperfections which will invariably be made manifest in actual life. There is, doubtless, a vein of un- polished romance underlying the surface of every life although it may never have been discovered by its possessor, for who that has never loved, and hoped, and feared? In some instances this vein may be rich and varied, while in others it extends along an even and un- broken way, and would prove uninteresting to all but those immediately concerned. Romance usually repre- sents only the brightest side of the character with which we become enamored; and if, perchance, some trivial fault be made known, it is clothed in such gilded wrap- pings that its real deformity is hidden. Their heart-aches demand our deepest sympathies, and our hearts throb with indignation at the wrongs or calumnies that have been heaped upon our imaginary perfect ones. We are completely captivated! Then contrast this with actua life, and no wonder that the heart grows sick at sight of the undisguised weaknesses which we are daily obliged to encounter. Take the greatest hero-the most perfect one that was ever pictured in the pages of romance-and let your life run parallel with his real life for a time, and see how soon he will descend from the summit of sublim- ity where imagination had unwittingly placed him! He is soon transformed into a being having like passions with ourselves, and subject to all the weaknesses that   7VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.     I7 beset our own frail hearts! And this ideal perfection is one of the characteristic evils that belong to romance reading. The present is swallowed up by the future; the real trampled under foot by the imaginary! There is but one way that life as a romance can produce happi- ness, and that is, when love is sufficiently great to hide the multitude of faults of those with whom we are thrown in daily contact. This may make a rich; a delightful poem of the lowliest life. It may gild with grandeur the mean- est cabin walls and change the humble inmates into heroes and heroines, although the world knows nothing of their life's unwritten romance. Ah! but such a love as this is not congenial to the soil of nature! Self-love is strongest there, and every scheme is apt to have self as its grand motive spring! "I suppose you will have that ideal of yours to occupy a prominent position in your picture," continued Nell returning to the charge again. '; Hey! Rena, I thought you would never stoop to anything short of a noble. man." "And I didn't," replied Rena, quietly. "I married one of nature's noblemen; what better could I ask?" But she was yet to learn that this romance would soon wear off or else verge into reality. Her heart was nrot able to send forth such love as would cover up the short- comings of others, or even bear with romantic patience the smaller trials of domestic life. And the ideal perfec- tions with which she had adorned the person of her hus- band were not impregnable, and might any day be marred by the uprising of some ordinary human passion.

O ^  ^*  ^ '^^^    ^3-^oi   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      173 CHAPTER XV. SHADOWS. Oft from apparent ills our blessings rise.--Battie. Days and weeks glided swiftly away with their busy rounds of planning and executing plans for elegance and comfort. The blossoms had all fallen off, and in their stead the growing fruits were visible, but the birds sang full as gayly as when Rena Howard first became mistress of her own charming little home. And that white cot- tage contained a system of, the most perfect order and neatness, but the novelty and excitement had worn off as the planning and arranging were nearing completion and there was nothing left now but the sober realities of carrying out plans already matured. There was not the same enthusiasm as that which lent a charm to the most homely scenes of housekeeping during the first few weeks, and the withdrawal of this romantic dress had left the wifely duties exposed in the homely garb of drudgery. There were trials (for trials there must be in every house- keeper's experience) which before had never thrown any responsibility upon herself. Bread unfortunately soured, or steak overdone, and these, although trifles in them- selves, are often capable of overshadowing a whole day that might otherwise be full of sunlight.    <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6632-00000088"/> 17 4     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "Get breakfast, wash dishes, sweep up, and so on throughout the day, one day with another," was her motto. "I declare I would just as lief work in a tread- mill, for it could not be more monotonous than this." There were no ambitious scenes connected with these homely duties, and no wonder that to one who had ever feasted upon these dreams they should become dull and irksome. Besides, Philip was away so much, and there was no one with whom she could converse who could at all enter into her feelings, and even he could not really understand them; but he could, at least, sympathize with her in her trials. His, as we have before remarked, was a matter-of-fact nature, and could better bear the respon- sibilities of life than hers; but, in fact, the restrictions of life are not so great with men, thereby rendering their lives much less monotonous than those of women. And they, perhaps, are too apt to imagine that women's cares, because little ones, are necessarily of little importance, which is a grave mistake. It is not every great achieve- ment that has been brought about through great trials; but the sum of life is made up of little things, and a mul- tiplicity of the cares connected with these small affairs often assume more huge proportions than the careless observer would suppose. May it not be supposed that many a world-renowned hero, who has reached the sunm- mit of earthly fame, has yet experienced fewer trials than one of weaker frame and courage has undergone in the various conflicts of household work? Woman's life is made up of trials, and no wonder that so many lives, who have never been illuminated by the   VA NQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       1 75 light of God's Spirit, have become soured and embittered. Men, of course, have their trials also, but their sphere is riot confined to one little corner, with the same perplexi- ties ever before their eyes. But we would not speak dis- paragingly of the place woman is destined to occupy in the world, for it there is an earthly calling worthy of re- spect, it is the faithful performance of the duties of the wife and mother. God, of course, knows what was best for her; and when He said that "woman should be chaste, keepers at home, obedient to their own husbands," he was only dealing in love. A true, devoted wife and mother is to the family circle as the heart which with every pulsation sends the life-sustaining fluid throughout the whole system, and at the same time is, or ought to be, subject to the reasoning faculties of the head. The price of a true and " virtuous woman is indeed above rubies." But woman's education, at the present day, is sadly at fault, even in a worldly point of view, for we know that if the. Spirit of God reveals to her her proper place, there should be no further demurring. Her education is superficial, and the God-given edict of being man's "help-meet" is, especially among the middle and higher classes, too nearly ignored. Perhaps in the lower it may be even worse, for there she is too often reduced to a place of servitude; but it is all decidedly wrong. She is brought up with but little knowledge of domestic duties, and less care whether these duties are properly or im- properly performed. In truth, she lives a gay, butterfly sort of life, with simply a desire for admiration, and no    <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6632-00000089"/> 176     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE more care or responsibility than is manifested by that poor, unconscious insect of a day. No wonder, then, that when the weighty responsibilities of domestic life fall upon her inexperienced shoulders she shrinks from the burden and displays a sour and disagreeable temper, when a sweet one would be so much more desirable. Mothers, this is your fault more than your children's, and you are responsible, whether you believe it or not, for many of the heart-aches which your child, if thus trained, will inevitably have to endure in years to come. You may be actuated by the utmost kindness and love, and feel, as we have heard mothers remark, that " there is enough of care and hardship in store for them in after years to permit them to be free and independent of it now." This is but a mother's weakness. The majority of cares which are looked upon with so much horror would be no cares at all if the mind were properly trained to bear them. Strengthen your daughter's principles, teach her with ready and willing hands to go forth in the discharge of the duties which-naturally belong to this life, and that it is far more honorable to present to the world's view a browned and labor-hardened hand than seek to shuffle her own duties upon shoulders often less able to bear the burden. The summer had been growing warm-too warm for comfort-and everything wore a lazy, languid look. Rena threw herself upon a lounge and gave vent to a flood of tears. That day of all others had been exceedingly warm, and she had become unusually fatigued and out of humor, but with what she could not even have told   VA A4NQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.     1" herself Everything went wrong, and, as a matter of course, she went the same way. It was one of those desponding days when everything seems governed by the rules of contrariness, which, doubtless, all of my readers have experienced-a day when every bright- ness of life is eclipsed by shadows, and yet there has been no apparent gale by which these clouds were brought above the mental horizon. "What can be the matter, darling?"Philip asked, casting aside the implements he was carrying and drop- ping upon a knee beside her. She hastily brushed away the tears she had vainly tried to conceal at his unexpected entrance, and tried to smile, but it was like the sunlight struggling to pierce the threatening clouds of an April day. "Tell me what the trouble is; do /" he continued in a pleading [tone. "It makes me miserable to see you thus." "Oh! I'm ashamed of myself, Philip," she answered, sobbing upon his shoulder, " but I do feel so miserably." "And what makes you feel so?" he asked, with a tone and look of the utmost tenderness. "You do not, can not, doubt my love for you?" "No, I do not doubt you," she replied, after the force of her grief was spent in convulsive weeping; "' and I could not, if the whole world were to ask me, tell what the matter was; everything seems so tiresome and dis- agreeable." "You have been working too hard and worrying about your housekeeping arrangements, Rena. Don't trouble    <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6632-00000090"/> x 78     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE your mind any more if things do go wrong; everything seems remarkably nice to me." "There seeins such a sameness in it all," she con- tinued, with a wearied look. "It is the same thing over and over each day, with nothing to draw one's mind away from the dull routine." Philip Howard pressed her closer to his bosom, while he smoothed down her disheveled tresses with his broad, bronzed hand. "I never dreamed that you were unhappy," he mur- mured, in a broken tone, as a deep-drawn sigh escaped his lips. "I imagined that you were as happy as my- self, and no lark could be more cheerful than I have been all these live-long days." Rena marked the tremulous voice, and her heart felt a pang of guilty self-reproach, and, in truth, when she felt a renewed assurance that love sympathized with her labors, it sweetened the bitterness of life and rendered the burden far easier to be borne. How beautifully this coincides with the Christian's ex- perience, when the world " casts out his name as evil " (as it will do in proportion as he walks as Christ walked) an. offers nothing that is able to satisfy a heart that finds nothing in common with the scenes below! How the sympathies of that One who, ever true to the love that led him to leave the realms of glory and become a will- ing victim here, cheers and sustains the desponding soul! And could the selfish heart, in a natural sense, only real- ize more perfectly how love lightens up the toilsome way and cheers the desponding soul, would it not be more   VA NQ UISHED LIFE-DREA M.     179 freely expressed? But this morbid tendency was not so much a fault as the fruits of a disease which was rapidly undermining her constitution. Her overtaxed nerves were even then feeling the effects of having been so severely taxed, although they had not yet given way; but, like the discords from some misused harp, they were destined to send forth other than the strains of gladness. "I don't feel so unhappy now, Philip," she whispered, at length wiping away the tears from her eyes, although their traces could not be obliterated. "When you are here and talk in this way I feel like I could bear any burden; but somehow, when you are gone, everything makes me so miserable." "Then come with me into the open air, for poor Nina is standing all this while unsaddled, and I know she is tired and very hungry." The faithful animal neighed beseechingly as they ap- proached her, and seemed to acknowledge the caresses as Rena stroked her long, flowing mane. "Let me lift you upon her back," he remarked. "You used to enjoy horseback riding, and perhaps it will help to drive away the ' blues.'" She sprang lightly upon the back of the noble animal, and in the ,happy companionship of the hour soon for- got the trials that, during the day, had hung like a night- mare over her mind. The evening passed cheerfully away while rehearsing future plans and prospects. Philip dwelt long upon his business plans and speculations, and she listened with marked attention, although further than a desire for his    <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6632-00000091"/> 80o     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE success she had but little interest in these matters, and could cheerfully leave them all to his better judgment. t' Why, what is this?" he asked, as he opened a little memorandum that had been thoughtlessly left upon the table. "Please give it to me, Philip," she replied, extending her hand to receive it. "It is only my journal, and can not interest you." "Why do you think it would not interest me, dear? Don't you suppose that whatever interests you is of im- portance to me?" "Of course not. Don't you remember the story I wanted you to read the other day, and you said you would not give a penny for all the novels in existence?" The hand was still reached out, but Philip laughingly refused, saying, "I did not know that you could find matters of inter- est enough to justify you in keeping a diary; but I must see what kind of jottings it contains." "August ist. I can not say that this is 'the begin- ning of days' to me to-day, for of all my life this, with- out any apparent cause, has appeared one of the most miserable. Everything wears a gloomy aspect, and the religion which I once hoped I possessed seems a dead and worthless thing. Surely it ought to lift one above the troubles and cares of this world, but it does not seem to elevate me above them. The truth is, I believe I have been mistaken, and that I am not a Christian at all; for surely I would see more evidence of it within my wretched heart if I was one, and would not be in this gloomy,   V  fANQUISHED LIFE DREAM.     I81 fearful state of soul. And life is not the happy dream that many seem to find it, nor even as I once thought it might be, but a troubled, weary scene from which we shall all soon awake-but awake where? How wretched to pass such a life here, and still not know what it will be after this existence is over!" Philip closed the book without reading further, and sat for some time in gloomy abstraction. He had always considered his wife quite religious, having observed that her daily devotions were rigidly attended to; that she took the sacrament, as they termed it, and was quite zealous in attending religious services; but he little knew what a cold, formal and empty thing it all amounted to. As far as outward form went, she was one of the world's "consistent professors, and, doubtless, as many others have done (for such are numerous), in heart '" thanked God that, she was not as others " who lived lives of less Pharisaic formality than herself; but at the same time her conscience told her that all this "righteousness was as but filthy rags." And if her best works were so utterly rejected, by God, what was she to do with the dark rebel- lion and unbelief of her heart-with the many, many sins which grew out of them and were made manifest in her daily life? She had been hoping to be saved at last, partly through the atoning work of the Cross and partly through her own religious exertions, not having realized that Christ "came to seek and to save that which was lost," not to half save them. But how many, alas! are in the same condition-honest, earnest souls, no doubt, but still enshrouded with darkness! The great difficulty    <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6632-00000092"/> 182     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE in this case is, that they are not ready to acknowledge themselves as utterly lcst, under the curse, where God says that every child of Adam stands, and consequently they are trying to rake up some good from among the rubbish of their hearts, something to balance against the evils that their own conscience only too clearly reveals. But that Word which is forever established in heaven will never bend to meet them on half-way ground; they must either be saved in God's way alone, or not be saved at alld  u What makes you write in that style, Rena?" he asked, at length relinquishing the book to her own keeping again. "It makes me unhappy to read such gloomy thoughts." "I never intended you should read them," she an- swered, hastily stowing the book away; "but I cannot write otherwise, for these thoughts flow from a heart that knows no perfect peace, either with God or upon earth." "Do you think you should be happier if you were back in girlhood's freedom from care again?" he inter- rogated tenderly. "God knows it grieves me to see you so wretched." "Freedom from care! When have I ever known free- dom from care?" she replied almost bitterly. "Persons talk of the happy years of childhood, but my life has been devoid of that blissful period. I was, perhaps, sur- rounded with as much that was sufficient to promote happiness as others, but through reaching out after the future, I lost the present. And really, Philip, I am some- times prompted to believe that this life is nothing more than an insane dream. If we were to see persons pass- ing all their time in blowing up bubbles and then pursu-   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      1 83 ing them, vainly imagining that they were delicate glass balls, would we not immediately say that they were in- sane or idiotic? But doesn't the youth, the adult and the hoary-head follow the same pursuit of these airy bub- bles, although each one bursts as soon as he clasps it in his hand? It all seems so mysterious; but I suppose a maniac is not capable of understanding the wild fancies of an insane world!" "You allow yourself to study about such things too much, Renao; and it is all nonsense to torture your mind in this manner. Let these thoughts alone and think of practical matters. If the world is insane, and you among the rest, you are not capable ot turning physician and curing the dreadful malady." "I know that," was the prompt 'rejoinder; " and per- haps these are only the insane fancies of a mind over- shadowed by 'constitutional melancholy,' which I shall always be obliged to endure; but oh! the bare thought of having to drag through life in this desponding way, without knowing what is beyond, is simply horrible!" "Well, don't think of these things any more," he mur- mured soothingly, as his sleepy eyelids could no longer forbear to close, and his wayward thoughts wandered away into the land of dreams. "Don't think! as though I could avoid it," she solilo- quized with bitterness, and her dilated eyes sought to penetrate the surrounding darkness. "I wish I couldn't think." But thoughts would come into her mind and drive away each drowsy feeling until the lagging hours of night were far spent, and through utter exhaustion she fell asleep.    <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6632-00000093"/> 184     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE CHAPTER    XVI. DESPONDENCY. I never heard Of any true affection, but 'twas nipt With care, that, like the caterpillar, eats The leaves of the spring's sweetest book-the rose. -Thomas AIiddleton. It is useless to try to recount these weary days as the summer's wane ushered in the bright-hued autumn, and anon the white-robed winter passed with its piercing winds and blithing frosts; but during all this while Rena Howard, as if personating an April day, was displaying alternately sunshine- and shower, as shadowed forth by smiles and tears. And she really could not help it, al- though there was no real cause for tears; but her despond- ing soul seemed overburthened, and she felt like weeping, and she wept. But as the "perpetual dropping of water will wear away even stone," even so Philip became ac- customed to her gloomy and desponding moods, although his knowledge of these melancholy turns was only dis- covered by accident, and except upon such occasions she never referred to them; and, in fact, his coming scat- tered her fears as fogs are driven before the winds of the morning. At first those tears were a source of heartfelt   PANQ [ISIED LIFE-DREAiM.      185 grief; but pardon him, for he was only human; and, besides this, having a healthier nervous system, he was not able to understand what must appear to others as mere child- ish foibles. He learned, at lefigth, to look upon these fancies simply as womanish weaknesses-something that was not pleasant, but destitute of iemedy, and treated them accordingly. The increasing cares and responsibilities of a business life were occupying his time, and he had no leisure moments to wheedle away in childish follies. He was a man of energy, and determined that the world should not call his life a failure, but that it should know that he had lived and made his mark in its business places. As we have before said, it was only one of the world's painted delusions which he had in view; but the man of the world has nothing better than these pursuits with which he may vainly seek to satisfy his insatiate thirst. Is it, then, any wonder that he follows these phantoms with fleeting feet? The wonder is, that the Ch;ristian, who by faith has found Him who bore the wrath due to believers, can deign to follow in the world's scrambling train. And what miserable testimony is given by those of whom He has said, "Ye are not of the world, even as I am not of the world," when they follow in the world's de- luded footsteps. If '"ye are the light of the world," and that light which has illuminated the believer's heart be hidden by the world's darkness, " how great is that darkness." "Let your conversation be with grace, seasoned with salt," is the divine injunction to the followers of Jesus; and men receive the portion of grace, for it is something 12    <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6632-00000094"/> 186     LINDEN W ILL; OR, THE that meets their wants. The tale of that grace which came down to meet the sinner in his destitution is accept- able to the ear, and no wonder-that it should be so; but throw in the salt which is calculated to preserve them in their pure and heavenly relationship, season that con- versation with the stringent duty, or rather privilege, of separation, not only from the world's open evils, but also its worldly enjoyments, and immediately they are of- fended. The close observer, if he is honest with his own heart, will acknowledge this. In all ages of the world such has been the result. The Jews could listen with profound attention while the Savior told of God's goodness to his ancient people, but the moment he ventured to condemn them, not only for re- jecting their long-looked for Messiah, but for trusting those rites and ceremonies which only shadowed forth the coming of Himself, they were ready to thrust Him over the brow of the hill or crucify him. "Marvel not if the world hate you," is the record given. "The serv- ant is not greater than his lord, and it hated me before it hated you." If you reprove an individual for his faults, will he respect you for it? No matter how great these faults may be; in fact, the greater the fault, if governed alone by sentiments of nature, the less he feels disposed to have them exposed, and the greater will be his dislike for you. Such is the heart of man. He would conceal from the world, and even from himself, the evil machina- tions of his own sinful heart, and deliberately shut out the light of God's truth, by which alone he can ever be   i'A NQ UISHED ' L FE-DREAM.   187 lifted above the darkness into which the unregenerate soul mnust sink! But we must return from our digression. "Philip, do put away your account-book and talk awhile," said Rena; "I've had no one but Bridget to speak to all the week, and it seems time my tongue needed a little exercise." ' Then talk away," was the quiet rejoinder, as the busy hand went on writing down column after column of fig- ures in a well worn day-book. "I can hear you." "But I want you not simply to /hear, but to talk to me," was the impatient reply. "Do you suppose that I want to live a hermit's life and never hear else than my own voice?" "Well, what do you want me to say?" he asked, with- out raising his head or manifesting the least interest whatever. "Let me see, five times four are twenty; five times---- " "O Philip, for goodness sake, do put away that abom- inable old book," she interrupted in an impatient man- ner, at the same time attempting to take the book from his hand.    / "Don't bother me," he answered curtly, and with a clouded brow. "I don't like to be interrupted in the midst of a calculation, you ought to know." Every trace of the sunlight that his coming had given to her face was in a moment overshadowed. The week had been a long and lonely one to her, for her husband had been away, and the thought of his coming at its ter- mination was all that gave any brightness to those pass-    <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6632-00000095"/> x88     LINDEN HILL; OR, TIE ing hours. She thought of all this, and turning abruptly away, left the room. There was a choking sensation in her throat, but pride kept back the tears which, had she been alone, would have flowed profusely, and, perhaps, have given relief to her over-burdened heart. "I'll show him that I can be as indifferent as himself," she murmured almost audibly, but a sigh involuntarily heaved her breast as her thoughts ran busily onward. "How hard I have worked all the week to finish Philip's new slippers for a surprise present, and thought how pleased he would be wiuh them," she continued to solilo- quize, "and now I don't feel like I wanted to even speak about them." It was a slight thing to drive away the heart's sun- shine, but many a wife has doubtless realized that a light word is capable of falling with greater force often than even a blow. "But why should I care," she continued; "che doesn't and I must steel my foolish heart, which God, knowing through- what I had to pass, should never have made of flesh. Yes, 'I'll gird on the cold armor of- pride,' and never make concessions or let him suppose that I miss the boon my heart so craves--his companionship; and even if I do weep, who regards my tears?" She brushed away a crystal drop from her cheek, and donned the cold, stern mask of indifference which so often concealed a "sickening heart within," and glided back into the unplaned grooves of domestic drudgery. "Let Bridget set the tea-table, Rena, and we will for- get the week's tiresome rounds in an evening walk."   VANQUISIIED LIFE DREA M.      189 Mr. Howard had finished his calculations concerning the week's profits and loss, and returned the detestable book to its accustomed place in the breast pocket of his coat before he allowed himself to think of his unkind or thoughtless conduct. He had meant no unkindness, but, like many other men, he knew better how to calculate in' terest than to deal with a thing so easily hurt as a wo- man's heart. He may come in daily contact with the world's rebuffs and scarcely notice it, and he is ready to admit that she is not constitutionally suited to combat in the political and pecuniary battles of life, and yet he is slow to see that there are often many and far more pain- ful wounds- inflicted by an unkind -act or word in the domestic circle than was ever received in the busy out- side field. But Philip Howard had yet to learn these facts, and he was supplied with a teacher altogether un- suited for making rapid progress in these domestic les- sons. Rena did not so much as raise her eyes at this request, but cooly remarked, "Bridget is busy and I shall attend to it myself." "Just as you please," was the indifferent rejoinder. "I supposed, however, that my request would be in ac- cordance with your own wishes or I should not have asked you to go." It was only a few cold sentences exchanged between them, but does not each unkind word or thought help to widen the dark chasm that separates what should be the mutual joys or sorrows of husband and wife? It may be but a trifling word spoken, but our whole natural life,    <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6632-00000096"/> 90     LINDLTN HL L; 0R, THE if separated into its component parts, is made up of small matters-often mere trifles, and yet it helps to build up an icy barrier between hearts whose joys or sorrows should know no separation-a barrier that will inevitably produce a polar temperature in the realm of domestic life. He made no further comment upon their past, but turning abruptly upon his heel with an indifferent grace, left the house, and soon forgot all about the little inci- dent in inspecting the premises and giving directions for the prosecution of future work. But it was not so with her. The torrent of grief that had been so pent up within burst forth as a cataract in all its unfettered freedom, and turning away from the half-finished task, she sought the solitude of her own apartment, "What is life worth?" she murmured, as the tears coursed freely down her cheeks. "And where is all the wealth of love that men are so ready to profess? Alas! it is all a farce, from first to last, and I hlave learned to have no confidence in any one." She took up a bit of delicate embroidery, hoping by this means to divert her mind from the unhappy theme, but the precision requisite was too much for her heavy eyes; so laying it down again, she drew the well-known little memorandum from her pocket and began to scan its contents "How fresh and green memory often brings the past before us," she read in a suppressed tone, "and how much oftener it casts shadows than sunlight over our life-   VA NQ UISHED LIFE-DREA lS .    191 paths. , My dear mother's face has-been more than ordi- narily visible before my mind's eye to-day, and it has grieved me sorely to think what poor returns I ever made for her unwearied patience and uncomplaining tender- ness. How much of truth is contained in that popular ballad, "Over the years of my life that have flown No love like mother-love ever has shone; No other worship abides and endures- Faithful, unchanging and patient as yours."' "Does not every-day life prove the truth of this? When sorrow, pain or disgrace come nigh, where is the true mother who seeks the poplar side and leaves the suffer- ing or deserted one alone? No where. It is when the world's withering blasts of scorn and reproach beat fiercest upon the outcast's unprotected head that the faithful mother stands unflinchingly at her post, regard- less of the contempt that may be heaped upon her for her loved one's sake. She may know his guilt, but the fount of mother-love is not thereby impeded. But is it so with man? Is he so ready to forget and forgive the shortcomings even of one who is " bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh? No, verily!" Her fingers twitched nervously as she hastily turned the leaves of the little diary filled with such gloomy thoughts; but she heeded nothing visible, and dwelt upon the dream of her own lost happiness-her own neg- lected self. And it is here that the secret cause of so much unhappiness may be found, even in this same un-    <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6632-00000097"/> !19     L NDEX IIILL; OR, T1E due appreciation of self, and seeking to make it the ob- ject around which all minor pleasures must revolve. And if self is thus considered the central brb of the family system, how could it be otherwise than that collisions should frequently occur, for every self by nature is the same, and all cannot occupy the one coveted central position? We say that by nature all are the same, but only in a measure. All by nature are fallen beings, "dead in trespasses and sin," and all have a selfish -nature; but the face of this earth, which even in an early age, when the blood of Abel cried for vengeance, and God said: ' Cursed shall be the ground for thy sake," still presents different aspects. So it is with the natural dispositions of mankind. The " thorns and briars " might spring up, but the hand of industry could pluck them up, and in their stead plant roses that would send forth a delightful perfume for the enjoyment of all around. But, after all this labor, though the thorns are eradicated and the roses bloom where once unsightly brambles grew, the curse is not removed-the word of God is not made void by the skillful hand of man.  And thus the natural disposition may be, and often is, beautified some more than others, in individual lives. In childhood, the parent may eradicate the bram- bles of envy and selfish indulgence, and in their stead beautify the mind with the roses of truth and gentleness; but the natural heart is not their native soil, and life-long cultivation is needed for their growth. If the garden of natural roses be again turned out along with the unculti- vated wilds, we know that the earth will again, in sponta-   VANQ UIStHED LIFE-DREAMi.     I 93 neous growth, send forth her brambles to choke and dwarf that which presented so much beauty, for the earth's curse is still there. And could the whole world be thus beautified and adorned, and generation succeed- ing generation continue with undeviating purpose of mind in striving to hide the traces of that curse, what would it amount to? Simply a life of labor and weariness-an effort to cover up the serpent's trail! And thus it is with man. His nature is evil, and can bring forth no fruit acceptable to God. He may educate and accomplish the mind, which is a very praise-worthy matter, and we would by no means speak disparagingly of an improve- ment which is as beneficial to society and the world's interests in general, and may be used advantageously in the cause of Christ; but all of this has no power to remove the curse of sin under which man has fallen. He may try to hide the nakedness of his sinful nature by the fig-leaf aprons of his own good works, but what will be the consequence? Even now, when his con- science "hears the voice of the Lord God," he is afraid and tries to hide himself behind the things of this world. The apron which but imperfectly concealed his naked- ness even from himself, is of no benefit whatever when he thinks of being summoned into the presence of God. And, reader, there are many such articles of dress worn in this age and generation. When sin first entered into the world Satan's object was to induce man to ignore God's plan and devise means of their own for salvation; and it was then, as now, the wish of his Satanic majesty to induce them to cover up their sin instead of coming    <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6632-00000098"/> 194     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE knowingly naked and destitute into the Divine presence and receiving a robe of His own preparing, which was even then wrought through the death of a victim. We say again, that the world abounds with such. And if you tell them of this wondrous robe-this righteousness which Christ has wrought out for man, they will tell you they " are trying to serve God--trying to do the very best they can." Adam and Eve were doubtless doing "the very best they could when, perhaps with weariness "they sewed fig-leaves together and made for themselves aprons," but we see it did not remove their guilt, nor even tranquilize their conscience. The work, as we have pre- viously remarked, which will forever cancel guilt-for- ever remove the curse under which you and I, as of the posterity of Adam, have fallen-is not our own work, but, through faith, a perfect trust in the Savior of sinners, who undertook our cause.

I am not going to write in such a gloomy strain as yesterday, for I feel quite bright and cheerful. Philip will be home to-day and we have done everything that will require my superinten- dence, so that I may enjoy myself while he remains.

"And is t/is the happiness I promised myself?" she asked in an audible tone, closing the book, and, as if it contained anything of merit, returned it to its ac- customed place. "But I shall have to endure it all; so   VANVQUISHED LIFE-DREA M.     195 be still, my troubled heart." One word of forbearing tenderness would have conquered her stubborn will and have stilled the troubled waters of her unhappy soul, but her rigid nature would never make concession, or even acknowledge that she craved that peace-giving word. "And shall I ring for tea, mum?" queried a verdant specimen of the Emerald Isle, as she peered through the half-open door; " and sure it will all be cold if ye don't give yer orders." "Certainly, Bridget," she answered, at the same time pouring some water into the wash bowl and bathing her feverish cheeks, ":You may ring immediately;" and the girl hastened from the room. She smoothed ,back the soft braids of chestnut hair with a careful hand, and assumed the cold, unimpassioned look that so charac- terized her life, and with a firm, self-reliant step went forth to meet her husband who had just returned from l:is reconnoitering. She filled her accustomed place at the tea-table, performing the usual services in a quiet, formal manner, and saying but little except to give the neces. sary orders to the servant, who had witnessed too many squalls upon the sea of matrimonial life to comment upon the shadows she evidently saw looming above their little household. And thus the evening repast was gone through with in an awkward silence, for neither saw the position of husband and wife as before remarked, and so neither would relent. It seemed so hard to her that woman's lot should be cast in such a secluded corner, chained down there, with no rights or privileges, save a right to be a drudge, a slave, and obey men's whims,    <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6632-00000099"/> 196     LINDE'N HILL; OR, THE and then could not so much as claim in return their love or companionship. Her heart was filled with unac- knowledged bitterness towyard God, who, in her weak imagination, had given man so much and woman so little. Will not the heart of many a wife and mother respond to these sentiments? We are sure they will, and can only hope that the sequel to our story may convince them that God has not been partial in the distribution of His blessings, however much we are prone to believe ourselves robbed of our rightful share. It is, nevertheless, true that the Spirit alone can reveal our proper place and relationship even in the things of this world; and the husband as well as the wife will be enabled to see far more of these sacred obligations, as well as exercise more forbearance in this holiest of earthly responsibilities when once they have "been taught of God." -^^     ^M fo6.      VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAAI.      197 CHAPTER XVII. A HOUSEHOLD LIGHT. "A mother's love! Oh! who may breathe, Oh! who can feel its worth, Its patient suffering until death, E'en from our childhood's birth?" The pale mother lay like a blighhted flower upon her couch while the last faint beams of the setting sun vainly struggled for admittance into the darkened room. Philip Howard, with thoughtful countennace, sat holding the pale hand that lay so passively in his own, fearful of breaking the slumber that looked so near akin to death. It was an hour of unfeigned interest, for the wing of Death's Angel seemed yet hovering o'er them as if loth to relinquish its victim and take its flight. The light of a new joy had dawned upon the household in the person of a little pensioner upon their love and piotection--a tiny, feeble thing, unconscious of its own importance; but it was destined to occupy a prominent place among the plans and prospects of that family's future. The twilight had emerged into the deeper shades of night when a feeble wail startled the pallid slumberer. "Are you better, darling?" he whispered soothingly, while the dilated eye. stared wildly as if in astonislhment at the sound of the little stranger's voice.    <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6632-00000100"/> 98     LINDEN MHiLL; OR, 7 tiE "I think so," she murmured; and then pointing to where the nurse sat holding the infant, said, "a Have him brought here, Philip; I want to see him." He took the wee specimen of helpless humanity in his own arms and laid it beside her on the snowy pillow. "Isn't he a perfect little beauty?" he asked, as he observed the mother's look of deep tenderness rest upon its little wry, pink face. "He is going to look just like you, Rena; and won't he be so much company for you when I'm away?" The compliment would not have sounded very flatter- ing to those who were disinterested, but then, of course, the child was beautiful to them. She smiled faintly in answer to these remarks, but made no further reply. The memory of her recent trials came vividly before her mind, but they stirred up no bit- terness there now. It seemed as if the opening up of the fount of another love in her heart had completely transformed her whole nature, and she remembered no more the anguish of the past in the first joys of this new maternal passion. Ever;- plant not calculated to flour- ish in a world of bliss appeared to be eradicated, and the lonely hours gone by, with their fancied slights and neg- lects, were now things of the past, easy to be forgiven, when in the enjoyment of the unclouded bliss which had so recently dawned upon her soul. But yet she feared to trust the deceitful joys of earth; something whispered that it could not last. And again we must say that this was but the joy of earth, and however ecstatic it might prove for the time   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      I 99 being, it was not to be of long duration. The darker passions of the soul, which for the time were eclipsed by the introduction of this new light, would again rise up with their dark insinuations, for they were still there, rooted and grounded in the hidden recesses of her heart. Perhaps this joy is similar to that of the new-born soul when he sees his translation " from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son." - He then imagines that his earthly conflicts are at an end, in view of the new joy that has overshadowed every evil pro- pensity, not knowing that he has to carry with him the same identical nature, his former self, and that that self is the same unyielding and rebellious foe! iHe does not realize that he " is dead," as far as the old self is con- cerned, in God's sight, and which ought to be revealed in his daily walk, and the new life which is to, animate him now " is hid with Christ in God." The world around him may not be able to see the source of this new life, to understand the power by which he is enabled to go contrary to nature and keep its passion in the place of death; but he ought to know it, and not, if some of the grosser evils arise in his heart, doubt the reality of being born of God because he could do such things. He carries this old nature of envy, wrath, strife, etc., with him, but he is not to be governed by it, but is to leave it where God left it-in the place of death. It does not want to be left there, and rebels against it. Paul is portraying this experience when he says, " O, wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" But as the experience advances further he is able to add,    <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6632-00000101"/> 200     LINDEN HILL; O R, TIE "It is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me." When he understands the death of the old nature he no longer claims it as himself, but can say, "I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh (or former self) the law of sin." But although Mrs. Howard was a zealo-:s Bible reader, she had hitherto found no deliverance through these pre- cious words; and now that her doubts and darkness were for the time eclipsed, she felt no immediate need of deliverance. "What shall we name him, Rena-Julius Caesar, George Washington, or what?" the father asked, toying with the little fingers that contrasted so strikingly wi:h his own. "I don't like to ape the world's nobility; it is enough to patronize our little world at home," she answered, playfully. "I shall call him Philip--the same as yours." "I am sorry that I can not compliment your taste," he answered, jocundly, and at the same time pressing the hand that nestled so confidingly in his own, and kissing the cheek that vied in whiteness with the pillow upon which she rested. And it is true that the sacred name of mother had endowed her with new charms in his estimation, and he realized a deeper tenderness for the weaker ones who trusted him for protection. "A priceless little jewel," she answered, caressing the baby hand, " and how poorly we are calculated to bring it up properly." "' We will gain wisdom as he grows older," Philip an-   VANQUISEHED L1F8QREAiIr.     201 swered; " and besides, I can't see why where not as well qualified for that business as many others are."'.. "We may be that," she answered, closing her eyes wearily, for she had unwittingly exhausted herself in the conversation; "but when we cannot control our own un- guarded selves, we are poorly fitted to control another." "Then why can we not control ourselves?" he queried. "Rena, it is time that we should give up this childish folly and become more matured in our ways, for it only makes you look so cold and unloving, and renders us both mis- erable." In view of this new dignity bestowed upon him, he felt that he could readily "put away childish things," without realizing that anger and self will are not proper- ties of childhood alone, or even belonging to that period so much as to after-years. That the germ of all these pas- sions are in the infant breast, as the different parts of the unexpanded oak are all wrapt up in the acorn cup, to be dwarfed or developed in after life, is without a doubt; and some of these phrenological organs are to receive the'greater share of cultivation. 'Which shall it be? Will the parent leave them to grow as they will, leaving the grosser and more sensual to predominate?"As we have before remarked, it is not that by so doing our child could be made more than a child of nature-" of wrath even as others," for flesh cannot be transformed into spirit, with all the culture that love and patience can ac- complish,. As was said to Nicodemus, with all his re- ligious and moral instruction, "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." x3    <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6632-00000102"/> 202     L INDEN  ILL; OR, THE But for the present moral good of society in general, we know that such care and attention is needful, if there were no other considerations. It may be asked, what is the use of this, if it has no benefit beyond this life? Why do you build your house and adorn your grounds? Do you expect them to profit you for any great number of years? Will they benefit you beyond this life? 'But this is the world's business. So it is, and we leave it with the world; but for the Christian .parent are there no pro- mises beyond this life? And should you not live in the training of your children as well as everything else to his glory. We know that by nature men are not possessed of the finer sensibilities equal to the other sex. These traits of character need strengthening in early life, or he will never be properly fitted for dealing with sensitive natures. Do we not see the fruits of this neglect manifest in every-day life around us? How often have we observed even men of sterling principle indulge in sarcastic witti- cisms, without a moment's after-thought, which have stung to the very quick in the bosom of a sensitive wife. Perhaps it was some thrust at traces of her lost beauty, or elasticity of step, augmented by his praises, which she had valued so inordinately in the years gone by. He does not pause to consider for whose sake and through what years of intense suffering she had gone before she came forth as a mere wreck of her former self. It was a mere joke; and if reminded of its unkind import, he would consider her a " silly little puss " to suppose that he was in earnest. How many wives have experienced this   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      203 through this same fault of cultivating strength of will and manly courage at the expense of the more kindly-organs; and how often has the lip of sensitive childhood quivered from the same thoughtlessness, as with a cross word and rough hand the child was thrust away from some inno- cent amusement. That " words are more powerful than blows," is a popular adage, but no more popular than true, as every sensitive nature can attest. And mothers, you-with the generations of mothers gone by-are, to some extent, responsible for this failure. It is not that we would remove the responsibility from others, for we might with almost as much reason say, that they were born in sin, and consequently not repon- sible for the fruits of a corrupt nature. But as an atone- ment has been made for that corrupt nature, in the death of a Savior God--and it is individual responsibility to believe and accept it-even so, let the early training be what it may, when come to the years of discretion there comes in an individual responsibility which is no less binding. It has been said that mothers control the des- tiny of nations, and we know that the boy almost invari- ably takes his standard of virtue and morality from his mother, and holds it in greater or less esteem according to her estimate. "Timothy's commendable piety was ex- hibited in his mother before, him, and even his grand- mother's life was an example of the piety she professed. And it is strikingly to be seen that the world's prominent men, whether noted for good or evil, have generally been but personifications of the virtues or vices which charac- terized their mothers. If such, then, is the case, is no    <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6632-00000103"/> 204      INDEN .- Ir L;. OR, 7 THE the mother in some degree responsible for this same lack of sensitiveness which is so prevalent in the sterner sex? They surely are not born with this defect. We do not want to instill a sentimental weakness. We do not want to cultivate the art of flattery and its attend- ant follies, but we do want to cultivate those organs of kindness and consideration that would ever render our sons fearful of wounding a sensitive nature. -It need not in the least detract from a firm and self-reliant manhood, nor hinder the maintenance of every manly privilege; and we know that it would prove an antidote against the sorrows of many a desponding soul. It is not teaching your sons the rectangles and quadrangles of geometry, or your dluhflters a smittering of French anJ music, that is implied in the precept of "training up a child in the way he should go." These branches of study, if thoroughly understood, are all proper and right, and may be the means of great blessing; but there are many, many things oi a far more practical nature in daily life needful for the education of your child. And it is lament- able to see how many, calling themselves Christian paretts, and some who, doubtless, are such, going on heedless of this important fact. Of such we can only say, they may pass this matter with indifference, but "Be not deceived, for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap." An utter disregard of this matter has cast a blithing stigma upon the society of the present day. An inor- dinate desire for show and prominence, regardless, among those of limited means, of whose shoulders the burden   PVANQCIS"ED LIE -DREA M.     205 may fall upon, in procuring the gew-gaws of dress and parade which "they all wear." They will walk in the footsteps of this self-same '" they," to whom, in their be- nighted ignorance, they have become mere cringing, de- luded slaves! Is this, Christian mother, the " training up of your child in the way he should go?" We know that there is a recompense for all faithfulness at the "resurrection of the just; " but, even in a worldly sense, rest assured of this fact: if you sow these vanities, which are fleeting as the wind, you may expect to "reap the whirlwind." And it was this that the newly-made mother had often observed, and which now loomed up before her mental vision as she looked forward into the future of this her first-born child. She saw the danger, but knew no remedy aside from this world's wisdom, and consequently felt unprepared to meet it. It is a good thing to be con- scious of our own weakness, if we, only knew where to find strength ; but how little did she know of that blessed Source of strength. Tile little stranger was, indeed, a treasure to her heart; and as the glowing summer days passed lazily away and returning health brought a glow to her cheeks, herself, as well as the whole household, daily found new joy in this welcome little gift of heaven. "And sure, mum, but he is sich a darlint," Bridget , would say, when for a moment's time she could steal away from her department to have a play with the family pet. "Och, but I could not help laughing when he tried to scratch me two eyes out, for the soul o' me; he does it all in sich good airnest."    <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6632-00000104"/> 206     LIND EN tHILL; OR, TIlE "But you would soon get tired of it, Biidget," Mrs. Howard answered. "It is all very nice sport for the short time you have to devote to him, but you know how you said you used to be tired of Mrs. Ames' babe." "Och, and it was very different, mum," answered Biddy, with a toss of her head. "Minnie Ames was not like the darlint of our own, for I'll declare by the Saint Peter that I niver saw a meaner brat in the whole of me life." She spoke emphatically, manifesting much of the true Irish grit and palaver, for she always wished to be thought to approve of everything in the family where she resided, whether she did or not, and, of course, " our baby" was not going to be made an exception to the general rule. She entered the family of Mrs. Howard a confirmed Catholic, and doub remained so in heart to the end, but she endeavored, nevertheless, to appear to coincide with the principles adopted by the family. "And sure, mum," she would often say after returning from the little chapel that Rena Howard usually at- tended, there being none convenient of her own choos- ing, "I used to think our old church was all the one worth noticing, but faith and now I belave I like our new church better than the old." "And what has so changed your views?" was queried. "Surely everything is very different from that which you were-used to." "Oh! but I don't know that I could tell ye, mum; but the music is very good and it all seems nice," answered the girl, with an Irish bob of the head, for, after having   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      207 ransacked her brain in search of better reasons for the change of her creed, she was unable to find anything better than that already given. But Mrs. Howard well knew her character, for she was not a bad judge of human nature, and could often divine the thoughts, although the lips might utter senti- ments so much at variance with the thoughts within. "( I always know," she would often say to Philip, " that when Bridget is unusually good, there is some mischief brewing." "And why should you think that?" was asked. "I am sure shle seems to be a faithful girl, and I do not see how you could do without her." "I am not speaking of that," was, the rejoinder, " but of her abominable hypocrisy. It I did not make a com- plete study of her, I should never know how to take her." "She seems very fond of baby," persisted the husband, "and it will prevent you from being so closely confined, as you will soon be able to leave him with her when you go out." "Why, Philip! do you suppose that I would trust baby with Bridget?" she asked with amazement. "I should be afraid she would strangle him to death or put his eyes out before I got home, and then look me straight in the face and swear that she "never harmed the dear, sweet innocent." "Rena, you are perfectly foolish. I see no reason for so distrusting the poor girl, and really think her ignorance her greatest fault."     <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6632-00000105"/> 208     LINADEN IILL; OR, TIE Philip Howard spoke earnestly, and there was a shade of displeasure upon his countenance.

In the past few months, and during her illness, he had remained at home, and she felt that his presence could almost ward off the infernal powers. At least there was a feeling of security when he was present that immedi- ately vanished when he went away. And now the dark shadows had retreated to the background, and they both' earnestly-hoped they might never return to darken the new sphere of life that had but just opened up before her.

"I suppose we will have Mrs. Rogan for a neighbor soon," remarked Mr. Howard, as he seated himself at the dinner-table and began to carve the roast. "And what sort of folks do they seem to be?" asked Mrs. Howard, as she fastened on Phil's bib. "I some- how haven't formed a very good opinion of them." "O I hardly know," lie answered; "Rog-.n doesn't have much to say himself, which is quite as well, for Kitty, as he calls his wife, can easily talk enough for both." "Then I'm in hopes she'll prove quite entertaining," was the response. "But what sort of style does she represent?" "All kinds," he answered, with a burst of merriment; "at least she imitates all kinds, but she does not seem very perfect in any unless it happens to be the lowest grade.

But Phil had been so intent upon listening to the de- scription given of their expected neighbor that he had forgotten all about his dinner, or that he had told his mamma, in his imperfect way, but a short time before that he was "awfy hungy." -"Have they any children, papa?" asked the mother, knowing that that was the information the 'child most dezired. "They have one who seems quite childlike," he re- sponded, addressing the child, " although they say it has been about a century since her earliest childliood; but she seems to have gone back into that season of life again. It's the first century plant I ever remember see- ing," he continued, addressing the mother, " and I must acknowledge that it did not meet my expectations. I've always been told that the century plant bloomed at that mature age, and was exceedingly beautiful; but she is actually the ugliest old mortal that I ever looked at." "I think you will have to make the subject a little clearer before we fully understand you," answered Mrs. Howard. "We are not expert at enigmas." "Well, then, its an old aunt or great aunt of Mrs. Rogan," he replied; "an odd looking old soul who looks just like she would start to run if you only spoke to her. I never saw such a wild-looking tame creature in all my life. I know if she had been in Salem at tle   VA4 NQ UISHED SIFT-DREAM.     211  time of the witch slaughter she would have been saved the trouble of hobbling about after Kitty Rogan now." "Oh! Philip, you ought not talk so hard about her. I hope she may prove to be a real motherly kind of per- son; it would be so nice to have the company of such when you are gone." j I hope She may prove a suitable person to 'fill the bill;' but I'm sure that I should feel more afraid with such a looking person around than if I were alone," re- plied the husband, as he pushed back his chair. "But I've no time to dally; it takes scrambling to keep up with the world noiw-a-days, and however agreeable it would be to stop longer, I must attend to ' business be- fore pleasure.'" "What do you mean, Philip?" she asked, somewhat astonished. "Surely you don't think of going off again to-day." "Rena, I must/ " he replied. "Everything is lively and prosperous now, and time is worth money to me every hour." He did not realize that time is infinitely more valuable than money at all times; but then he only estimated it according to its money value. "Don't go away again to-day, Philip,"' pleaded the wife, in a faltering tone. "I have been so lonely until this morning, and you have been away so much." It had been only a few hours since his return, and the many cares and clouds (for clouds had returned) which had for days beset her path vanished at his coining like shadows before the rising sun. But now, as he said his    <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6632-00000107"/> 2T2     LINDENN IIILL; OR, THE business compelled his immediate departure, her heart sank to the zero of a cold cheerlessness. Little Phil had grown to be a gay, frolicsome child, wandering hither and thither at his own sovereign will, his childish voice the sweetest music of the household; but even with this somehow her heart had not yet found the rest and sunlight it had so long yearned for. "Lonely!" he answered, jocundly, and at the same time elevating his eyebrows. "I did not suppose you ever got lonely now with tiat interesting young gentle- man for a companion." And he pointed to the now slumbering child, who, with flushed and feverish cheeks, had sunk to sleep, and lay lost to consciousness in his little crib, the flaxen curls shadowing his baby face. "Do you think that would be sufficient company for iyouzI "Rena asked, trying to keep back the tears that were struggling to force themselves into her eyes. "'Of course he is a world of happiness to me; but can I tell him all my troubles?" "I should think so. You often talk to him as though he could understand things of far deeper import." "He may consider these troubles trifling," she mentally exclaimed; " but God knows their breadth and depth." "Rena, you know well enough that my business can not be neglected," he continued, in an earnest manner, at the same time drawing on his gloves preparatory to his departure. "And I think you ought to overcome these childish fancies. Bridget is here to take the work   VANQUISIED LIF DREAM.      213 off your hands, and Phil to be company for you. I see no reason why you should be so dissatisfied." She said nothing further, but an indescribable feeling as if she had been wronged found a lodging place in her heart. She had implicit faithn his nobility of clarac- ter, but doubts of his love would force themselves upon her mind. "For where the treasure is there will the heart be also," often sounded in her ear, at least men- tally, and she felt that the treasure of her husband's heart was getting to be his business speculations. It is not a pleasant thing for a wife to think that another ob- ject holds the place in her husband's heart which shoulld belong to herself, even though that other object be only the inanimate dross which the world so eagerly seeks after, and which he tells her is only desired that it may promote her comfort and happiness.  It is all well enough in its place and very needful for comfort in the present life, but even in a worldly point of view it is often disastrous to happiness. Any object whatever, if allowed to alienate the thoughts from those most closely united on earth, can never bring settled happiness. It may serve to feed the ambition with exciting slimulus, b-it never to satisfy the soul. It is in possession and not in pursuit that real happiness is found, however this adage may be reversed, as it is in general; and the one whose thoughts can rest content with what he now has, instead of being forever on the wing, is the happy individual. It is not that an indolent indifference should be encour- aged, which is the more revolting' side of the two ex- tremes, but the heart should be schooled to rejoice in    <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6632-00000108"/> 214     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE the little or much that it possesses, and enter into thank- ful enjoyment of it. We speak now of those who belong to this world, and not of the Christian. His "citizenship is in heaven," as we have before shown, and his affections ought to be correspondingly weakened for the perishable things of earth.. It is of the world's votary we speak- those who would sacrifice upon the altar of a worldly ambition every emotion of tenderness and domestic feli- city-for what? For the gilded treasures that this world holds out to view, although repeated failures prove to him that the world is bankrupt and never pays its prom- ised bribes! And should it ever pay all that was held up before the eye of the deluded one, upon closer scrutiny he finds out it is only counterfeit, and he sets off again in pursuit of the genuine ore. It is to the world's devotee we speak, without expecting him to hear, unless God's spirit should enlighten his understanding; but should some one who is "not of the world," and yet is follow- ing in the world's footsteps, chance to hear, it will not be words thrown away. Philip Howard, as if touched by a pang of conscience turned abruptly at the door to cast a parting glance of tenderness upon his wife as she stood there in such chill- ing silence, for her will was too stubborn to plead longer for him to stay. "You won't get low-spirited now because I must go will you?" he asked, stooping to kiss her cheek. But there was no returning kiss, and her eye told no tales but such as might emanate from a cold, unimpassioned heart.   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      2 5 "You are at perfect liberty to go and stay just as long as you please," she answered, haughtily. "I'm sure I can make it a matter of the utmost indifference to me." (, Veiy glad to hear that," was the sarcastic rejoinder. "Shall feel more at liberty now that you have graciously vouchsafed such unbridled freedom." It was not such a parting that husband and wife should ever know here amid the uncertainties of human affairs, for who knows " what a day may bring forth," and the thoughtless words spoken to-day may prove the last. But they did not think of this then, and he left the house without further remark, and was soon carried away to- ward other and busy scenes with which his heart was already so much occupied. Rena watched his retreating form with suppressed emotions until entirely lost to view; but as soon as the last glimpse had vanished she turned away from the win- dow, and her pent-up feelings found vent in a copious flood of tears. She was usually able to keep a wonder- ful control over her feelings, that the weak side of her nature might not be revealed, but now that there was no further need for exercising that control, all her weakness was made painfully visible. Pride' may add charms to the outward appearance, but it has but little virtue as a healing balm for a " wounded spirit." "Why was I weak enough to be caught in this matri- monial trap?" she at length soliloquized, slowly wiping the tears from her red and swollen eyes. '! I had seen it all clearly pictured out years ago, and utterly detested the weakness that led women into their self-imposed chains.    <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6632-00000109"/> 216     LINDE N ILL; O R, TIIE How vain to imagine that one's own experience will be different from the common herd, or that woman in gene- ral will ever be liberated from her chains until death in mercy sets her free!" But yet Rena Howard shrank from the approach of this merciful messenger, and dreaded an entrance into the dark and unknown world beyond! There was a horror connected with the very thought of death which she could not overcome, and her overtaxed nerves, in their excited condition, often prompted her to believe that this unwelcome messenger was near in some fright- ful form. Often in these times of mental aberration a presentiment of some coming evil seemed so vividly por- trayed to view as to almost cause a dethronement of reason altogether; but this, as a dark cloud, would be suddenly carried away by the coming of her husband or friends, and she would feel ashamed ot the weakness that fostered those fears which but lately loomed so threaten- ingly above her. And are there not thus many despond- ing souls driven to insanity by continually brooding over the real or imaginary ills of life, by ever looking on the dark side, and never realizing the many blessings that God, in his goodness, has given to us all? It is only too true that the great adversary of souls is as busy now, with a much more extended field for operations, as when he first brought his subtle falsehood into Eden's- delight- ful bounds. The great aim and object of Satan has ever been to make man doubt the goodness of God. He sought to convince Eve that Godl wished to deprive her of something which would add to her happiness in regard   VANQUISITED LIFE-DREAMA.     2 17 to the tree of knowledge-something that would enable her to s "know good and evil," without permitting her to know that by obtaining this knowledge she would then be fallen into a state of alienation from God, from which she could have no power to extricate herself. And it is precisely the same to-day. That same dreadful enemy of man ever seeks to point out the hardness of the lot which God has allotted, casting a shadow over the many sunny spots that are graciously given to gladden our lives down here. And of how many lives which have been thus embittered this wide world is a witness! Which of the two men are -the most ready to believe-the devil's dark insinuations, or the Lord's openly revealed truth- we have only to look about us to see. And he had succeeded admirably with our young friend, Lorina Howard; had contrived so to darken life as to cause her to tire of it, and yet to shrink from the proffered exit to the world to come! The thought of ' shuffling off this mortal coil " was simply horrible, and betwixt the two-the dread of death and the weariness of life-she was brought to a condition well nigh bor- dering on despair. A low wail from the crib at length drew her thoughts from the gloomy picture she had been contemplating. "My own pet lamb!" she murmured, taking the child in her arms and pressing it to her bosom. "If God denies me every other love, He still grants yours." The blue eyes were lifted to the mother's face with a questioning look, but he could only tenderly stroke her cheek and lisp, ( mamma, dear mamma."

What love so all unselfish as a mother's! What eye, save hers, can watch with unabating love, not only the first faltering steps of infancy, but also the more wayward steps of sin and shame! And yet we know that, although of earthly loves there is none other so purely unselfish, there is a love which completely eclipses this-.even the love of God as revealed in the person of the Savior of sinners! "Bridget, I wish that you would carry Petty out into the fresh air," she remarked, as the girl entered the room, for the storm of her grief had gradually subsided and she saw so much work that needed to be done. "He does not appear altogether well, and I think a little out-door recreation will benefit him.' "Och! and is the dear darlint sick ye say, mum?" asked the brawny creature, as she extended her arms to receive him. "And it's meself that'll take the care of him thin." But the child shrunk back from her extended arms and clung only the closer to his mother's bosom. "Take him and go where he will not see me, Bridget," continued Mrs. Howard. "I would like to finish this piece of work to-night, if possible." TIhe strong arms of the servant soon held captive the resisting child, and he was carried from her presence; but his pathetic cries at intervals still reached her ears from where they sat together upon the door-yard green.   2        MyVA4NQUISISED LIFE-DREAM.     2i9 "Great heavens! what can that girl be doing to him?" she at length exclaimed, as a piercing cry reached her ear; and throwing aside the work she had vainly hoped to finish, she called: "Bring him to me, Bridget; i    it is time to light your fire for tea, anyhow." The little one gave a tearful smile of delight as he again reached the arms of his mother, at the same time casting a look of dismay upon the form of the retreat. ing girl. But convulsive shudders still crept over his frame and low sobs at intervals disturbed his quiet breathing, as he lay upon his favorite resting-place-a mother's bosom. "Bridget, what-does this mean?" she asked at length, pointing to the purple indentations of the fiendish girl's finger-nails upon the child's tender' limbs. "Have you again been pinching this helpless child?" "Faith, mum, and I'll jist'swear by the Virgin that I niver did that," she answered, with a bold, unflinching look. "I have not the least confidence in what you say," an- swered Mrs. Howard, with a feeling of utter, contempt; t "but if your conscience is not already seared, you will doubtless own to this, as you have to such things before. Dear little Phil! so sick, and may never get well. Won't these marks be delightful for you to think about?" The servant left the room with a dogged indifference, and the unhappy mother bathed the brow of the feverish child with feelings more easily imagined than described. And again, for her, the night was passed in sleepless watching alone; and even days passed drearily away before the prattling voice and baby footsteps again glad- dened her cheerless heart. {{!,    <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6632-00000111"/> 220     LINDEN HILL; 0R, TIIE CHAPTER XIX.

"Now, the Lord of peace himself give you peace always, by all means." Mrs. Howard read the words in an incredulous-tone of voice, and then turning down the lamp, as if bewildered by its lurid glare, she leaned wearily back against the chair in meditative silence. "The peace of God," she murmured brokenly. "Then surely I cannot. belong to the class of kpersons addressed, for I know nothing of this peace. I believe the Bible says, 'There is no peace to the wicked,' and surely that is more applicable to me.

The clocked ticked loudly upon the mantel-shelf, as if trying to break the silence that reigned throughout the house, and the flickering firelight took alternate freaks of slumbering quietly, and then as suddenly brightening up ^   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       221 to cart quaint shadows upon the walls of the room where that wife and mother sat, pale and disconsolate.

Was not God, in his tender love and mercy, even then watching over her, although she knew it not? Iost assuredly He was, notwithstand- ing she imagined herself left to all the horrors of an un- loved and uncared for solitude. The warm summer months had all passed away, and the chilly November winds of a northern clime had swept away most of the seared leaves of the summer's foliage; but the aspect nature wore without corresponded strikingly with the feelings of the lonely one within that cheerless dwelling. "It is growing late, my darling," she -at length whis- pered, as if addressing the little slumberer,- who, regard- less of the late or early hours, was smiling from the land of dreams, knowing nothing of the trials which after- years might bring. "We had better go to bed, even though sleep-' tired nature's sweet restorer'--[ know, will be denied me; for 'she from the wretched flies, and lights on lids unsullied by a tear.' " Hark!" she whis- pered with a shudder, as if still talking to the child. "Bridget's sonorous breathing sounds like an omen of some coming evil!" She raised the lamp until its glow brightened the before dreary-looking apartment, and tenderly lifting her almost idolized child from its snug little nest, she placed him upon the snowy couch.    <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6632-00000112"/> 222     L I VD EN IILL; O R, TdHE "My precious, precious jewel," she murmured, again and again kissing the pouting lips and stroking back the flaxen curls from his white forehead. "What would be- come of my child if his mother was taken away? There would be no one to love and care for him as I do-and that may be very soon." Overcome with these feelings, she turned away from the couch and taking out her diary, which she still kept, notwithstanding it only contributed to the morbid melan- choly that overwhelmed her, she inscribed a few lines with a trembling hand. "Nov. 3d, r8-. If ever earth had any pleasures for me, I can truly say that I 'have seen them all fade away,' for I have none left now but my own precious boy; and the thought that I may be soon taken away from him makes his presence but little comfort. It is not that, to-night, I doubt Philip's love for us, but his eager- ness for wealth has completely eclipsed all other consider- ations, and it will only be when too late to remedy the evil that his eyes will be opened to these facts. Perhaps when he reads these thoughts, and the cold winter winds are shrieking above my unconscious head, he will awake to see what might have been prevented. In a short time another little life will be ushered into this heartless world, perhaps to suffer the many heart-aches that its mother has endured. God only knows I wish I could leave my dar- lings without a misgiving in His care; but I cannot. It is said that happiness and misery are tolerably equally divided in this world; but can it be that every mother's heart has trials equal to my own?

And yet Christ came to de- ! t .liver those Iwho through fear of death were all their life-time subject to bondage.' Can that deliverance have been wrought for me? Oh! that I could but know that I was forgiven, and need not tear the wrath of a sin- avenging God ," She sank upon her knees before the smouldering fire and buried her face in her hands in an attitude of prayer, but her broken petitions seemed to rise no higher than her head, and the Hearer of prayer appeared afar off. She did not then know how much she was dishonoring God in doubting his full and free forgiveness, and how that "God in Christ by his Spirit was even then beseech- ing her to be reconciled to Himself. It was her own stubborn heart that would not accept that love, which nothing but these strokes of divine chastisement could ever humble, and which a Father's hand was inflicting, although his eye was looking with pitying tenderness upon that object of his love writhing beneath the heavy strokes. It was- all in love, but she knew it not, for the heart that had so often rebelled against the authority of an earthly parent, was still the same unyielding heart of flesh. And yet she professed to be not "walking after    <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6632-00000113"/> 224     L A YDE N IIL L; OR, TIME the flesh, but the spirit." But alas! how many like her- self, in this day of easy profession, scarcely ' know whether there b. any tIIly G'host," whereby they mtay by guided into the true path and correct understanding of God's word. Are there not those who profess to be God's children, and yet know nothing, experimentally, of the indwelling Spirit, and have never known what it is to ba "led by the Spirit of God?" The perishable body is too highly esteemed, when it is only a house. "Know ye not that ye are the temple of the Holy Ghost." Then why, with an unholy walk, should the Christian grieve that heavenly Inhabi- tant? Why clog the fo::nt of " living water," so needful for refreshment here in this wilderness world withl the unsatisfying things of earth? We know it is because of the sinfulness of the natural heart, which, in its enmity toward God, would fain dry up those streams of refresh- ment, which, having their source in GAd himself, would, if unobstructed, flow out to the refreshing of others who arc thirsting for the waters of eternal life. But God alone knows whether Rena Howard had ever drank of these refreshing streams, or only from some human cistern that could hold no water. That she was not altogether " dead in sin " could not be gainsayed, for the really dead could not writhe beneath the burden of sin any more than the literal dead beneath a burden upon the breast. Perhaps there was life begun in the soul, a "quickening" process going on, but as yet no deliver- ance; and this struggle in the womb of death was to con-   VA NQ UISHED LIFE-DREAI1.     2 2 5 tinue, until born of God, she was to enter into the glo- rious liberty of an heir of glory! But now she arose from her knees in a more troubled state than when she knelt down to plead with God for pardon. The won- drous condescension of God coming to earth in the per- son of Christ to reconcile sinful man to Himself, was not seen, and she vainly imagined that she must sue long and with many tears at the door of mercy ere God would stoop to listen to her cry. But her soul had not yet heard those expiring words, ' It isfinishzed!" as on the cross the Lord of Glory hung between earth's male- factors, submitting to be crucified by the puny arm him- self had made! Reason had acknowledged these cries, but to faith these scenes were afar off! She had not had a comprehensive view of that power which could call down legions of angels to do his bidding, and yet bore with meekness and forbearing love the ribald taunts and jeers, the robe of mock royalty, the buffeting and spitting upon, the crown of thorns, and, as the last that men and devils could inflict, the shameful cross! And still that cry of pleading love goes up, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." When " light in the person of the Son-of God had come into the world, they willfully closed their eyes upon its brightness; and because it revealed their own deeds of darkness," desired a murderer in his stead. But she saw none of tlhis deep love, none of this compassion. Why was it thus, poor, deluded one, that you chose to walk through darkness?    <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6632-00000114"/> 226      L INDE N 1ILLL; OR, TIIE "His anguish of soul on the cross has't thou seen? His cry of distress hast thou heard? Then why, if the terrors of wrath He endured, Should pardon to thee be deferred? '"For why was He there as the bearer of sin, If on Jesus thy sins were not laid? Then why from His side flow'd the sin-cleansing blood, If his dying thy debt had not paid?" 4' Then doubt not a welcome since God has declared, There remaineth no more to be done; That once in the end of the world He appeared, And completed the work he begun!" Yes, He finished the work, and she had, so far as sal- vation was concerned, nothing to do but believe the record of that quenchless love and commit all, every. thing, unreservedly into His hands. It is hard for a legal soul to do this. The first awak- ened thought implies self-work; the first cry of an awakened   conscience, "what must I do to be saved." But the answer in regard to this work of God, as asked by the legal Pharisees, was: "This is the work of Gods that ye might believe on him whom God hath sent." This, and this alone, is what the unrenewed soul can do that will be acceptable to God, for " whatsoever is not of faith is sin." But why was not some pitying hand stretched forth to open the blind eyes of her whose earnest cry rang forth, "Jesus of Nazareth, have mercy on   me?"   It was not the time for deliverance yet. The stubborn will was not   VANQ UISIED LIFE-DREA.       2 2 7 sufficiently broken; and until this was accomplished she could never enjoy a settled peace and communion with God. It was far advanced into the still hours of niglt when Rena Howard laid her weary head upon the pillow be- side her slumbering boy, not only with throbbing temples, but heavy -heart. Others, perhaps, have felt similar de- spondency, when God has been striving to reveal himself, amid the darkness through which the soul is wandering, bewildered and lost. What transporting joy for the soul thus benighted to come out into the unclouded light of God's truth! The wind shook the withered vine that lately adorned the casement and caused a creaking, discordant sound, that vibrated strangely through her excited nerves, and strange, wild fancies seemed to assume grotesque shapes around her. "Chirp, chirp," sang the cricket from the hearth-stone, but it made no music to her ear. A strange, wild feeling, as if something not of earth was near, took possession of her mind, and she imagined the fancied spectres that crept so stealthily from the shadowy corners of the room were spirits from the invisible world. "Oh! this is horrible-horrible!" she murmured, star- ing with wild, dilated eyes through the shadowy room. "Infernal fiends! have you come to torment me before the time?" and snatching the Bible from the table near, she placed it beneath her pillow as a talisman against the power of evil spirits seemingly around her, and it was only when nature was utterly exhausted that she fell into a death-like sleep i!    <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6632-00000115"/> 228     LINDEN HILL; OR, TIME There must hive been a degree of faith to believe that the Word could keep the demons of darkness away; but the character and merits of that faith would be of a doubtful nature. She believed in the all prevailing power of the God of heaven, but the-devils believe that, "and tremble" in consequence of this knowledge, and are not made happier, but contrariwise. Was it not partially the "hour and power of darkness'i that heightened such horrid fancies, and not altogether a disordered nervous system? There was a trembling, as in the case of Felix, at thoughts of "a judgment to come," believing in the power of a Supreme Ruler of heaven and earth, but an utter blindness to the love of Him who is love itself And may not her case be similar to many others in these last days, when zealous Christians are so eager to see the "world converted," that vast numbers are added to the professing ranks who have never been delivered from the bondage of darkness? Alas! it is but too true. The zeal of the flesh leads the individual from the first honest desire for the glory of God, only to grapple for numbers to hold up as a proof of the world's advancement. But where is the advancement of this world in holiness visi- ble? Do the long catalogues of murder and debauchery, of adultery, with the numerous defaults and varied crimes, prove it? Ah! but look at the spread of Chris- tianity; look at the additions to the churches. Yes, and look at these vast numbers of professors who walk just as the world walks, and see if you can draw the line dividing the sacred from the profane, separating those who profess to be a heavenly people from those who   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      229 openly acknowledge themselves to be of the earth? It is not every one who says "Lord, Lord, that shall enter into the kingdom of God." "Many in that day shall say, " have we not taught in thy streets, and in thy name done many wonderful works; when He shall say, I tell you I know you not." It is not in profession, but inl pos- session that God is glorified. It may be loudly talked, and even predicted, that by the spread of the Gospel truth the world will be con- verted, and that when Christ comes to reign in millen- nial glory the earth will be fitted in holiness for that reign. But what does the Word say?"As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it oe also in the coming of the Son of man." "The Gospel shall be preached to all nations for a witness." But alas! how many hear it weekly and still continue to disbelieve, and how many profess to believe who have never entered into its real mneaning; and we know that all will not receive it-not because God de- crees it, but because their own wilful hearts reject it. "Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life." As Israel was taken from among the nations of the earth to be a separate people, so the Christian is chosen "through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth" to be a heavenly people, in separation from the evils sur- rounding them. This world is, as before said, now under judgment (John xvi), for when it rejected its King that sentence was pronounced upon it. Can man revoke that sentence? Can he better what is under God's condem- nation?

He may warn them, as the angel warned Lot, to " escape for their lives," for the judgments pronounced will surely be forth- coming, notwithstanding man continues to plant, to build, and seek to drown the voice of conscience in the strains of sensual music; but it will not change the unchanging Word of God, and these judgments will still be pending until poured out upon a blood-stained world. When he "shall break his enemies with a rod of iron," when all things are put down, the devil chained, and all that would oppose his reign over the earth, then will the millennial glory dawn. Then it is that : the desert shall blossom as the rose," and this groaning earth, delivered from the power of sin, rejoice, acknowledging the King she once rejected and crucified. How little the unbelieving world knows that Christians, as the " salt of the earth," are all that now stands between them and the wrath of God, as His Word declares will be poured out upon the earth. "They the salt alone preserve it- They removed, the judgment come."   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       23I CHAPTER XX. KITTY ROGAN. "Oh! where is reste? Or where is pithe now? Whither is gentle harte and mercy fled? Are they exilde out of our stony brestes, Never to make returne?" A basket of rich, golden apples had been placed upon the table, and Rena Howard sat listlessly engaged in par- ing them, but it was evident from her absent-minded look that her thoughts were occupied with other things. But her cheeks were flushed and her eyes heavy, while a deep-drawn sigh every now and then escaped her lips. Phil had gone out to reconnoitre, or rather to gather up his alphabet blocks where he and Alice Dean had built them into walled-up sepulchres, and with their various toys played out "funeral procession" in the most ap- proved style. But mamma had told him that he must positively find every one of those blocks and put them in their box again, and so he had to destroy his tasty little graveyard just because it had been arranged that he must begin to attend to some practical duties now, and not to have all the time for play in future.

Mrs. Howard was irritable and nervous to-day, Philip had not come home at the appointed time, and the letter he had sent, telling her of his expected absence, had been through carelessness misplaced; and now all the horrid imaginations which were ready to loom up before her mental vision, and which she usually appropriated to her- self, were concentrated in the person of her husband. "What if he has been murdered!" she ejaculated, with a shudder. And in fancy she saw his pale, ghastly form in some lonely place, with visible marks of fiendish violence upon it. "Oh1, God! this is horrible!" she murmured, putting up her hand to shut it out from her view, as if the terri- ble apparition was an unmistakable reality before her eyes. It all seemed so real; but what is it that a diseased mind can not make appear real? It can see sights and hear sounds that the healthy and well-balanced mind would never dream of, and yet all appear so real, so un- mistakably true. Such sensations are, indeed, pitiable, and yet they are too often treated as childish weaknesses and passed by with indifference. "And how do ye find yerself to-day, mum?" asked Kitty Rogan, with an awkward bob of the head which was intended to be very polite, as she stubbed into the room.   VA NQUISHED L IFE-DPRELA ,7.    233 She was a short, thick, bustling little woman with an over-much flushed face, the cause of which Mrs. Howard had already suspected from having frequently come in contact with the fumes of her breath, which were neither sweet nor agreeable. "I suppose I am well as usual, thank you," she re- plied, as she laid down the apple that she was holding in her hand and brought forward a chair; "l but somehow I'm out of tune this evening." "And hasn't the husband got home at all?" she asked, divining at once the real cause of her troubles; for Kitty was getting used to Mrs. Howard's moods, as she ran in for milk or other necessaries, or perhaps occasionally to give vent to her own real or imaginary troubles. "No, he hasn't come; and I've been enjoying myself with all kinds of foolish fancies.- I don't want to have such fancies,-and have really been fighting against them in the most heroic manner, but they seem to get the best of it at last." "And what do you think kapes him, yer honor?" Mrs. Rogan wished to have people understand that she had moved in the higher ranks of society-no matter what kind of position she occupied there-and so she chose her words accordingly. "I can't tell; but I'm afraid he is sick," replied Rena, without considering that she had never dreamed of so simple an ailment as sickness, but that it was visions of a more frightful kind her dark imagination seemed to revel in. "I thought last night that I heard him call o X    <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6632-00000118"/> 234     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE me, and was actually so certain of it that I went out ex- pectinlg to meet him; but he did not come." "Is that raly so?" asked Kitty, with the knowing look of an astrologer. "Did ye raly hear him call your name?" "I thought so," was the rejoinder, as she smiled at the woman's earnestness. "I fancied that I heard him say 'Rena' as clearly as I ever did in all my life." "And do ye know," she asked, with a mysterious shake of the head, t" that the dead always come back one time to tell their nearest friends about their fate?" "Mrs. Rogan, I must say that I did not," answered Mrs. Howard, coldly, for she was beginning to be posi- tively disgusted with her superstitious notions. "Och! but they do," responded her informant, in an emphatic tone of voice; " they always do-t-hat's sartin." "Nonsense, Mrs. Rogan; that is all folly," laughed Rena. "How do you come to know that this is a fact? ' "Faith, and me own mither knew it to be so," she an- swered, with another bob of the head, but this was in- tended to make her words emphatic. "And it was on the evening of the day of the battle of Blenheim that me stepfather was beheaded. Och! and that was a day to be remembered 1 Me mither went to the sheep-fold in the dusk of the evening to see after the flock, and what should she see just fernenst her but a man without a head on!

VANQTUISHZED LIrFE-DREAM.     235 Her listener smiled incredulously as she went on with her story, but she did not deign to ask her how he could speak without a head, or if ghosts could talk as well without; and, doubtless, Kitty never once thought of the incompatibility of her story. "The next day," she continued, with becoming solem- nity, " she heard of me father's death." "Mrs. Rogan, I havn't the least confidence in any such stories," Mrs Howard remarked, with a gesture of impatience. "And do ye think that me own mither would tell such a lie?" she asked, her red face growing redder at the mere insinuation of such a thing. "And faith, but it's as true as the words of St. Peter, and I know it is!" "I don't doubt but she thought so, Kitty," was the apologetic rejoinder; ," but then perhaps she was nerv- ous, and being uneasy about him it made her imagine she saw him thus." The speaker knew well that imagination was capable of manufacturing almost anything; and although she might also have realized that the injunction of " physician, heal thyself," was applicable to her own case, she could not apply the remedy of indifference which she so readily pointed out to others. Even though her own fears were but imaginary, they seemed entertwined with the very fibres of her life, and could not be shaken off. Nothing but power divine could break their shackles.

Mrs. Howard felt that her comforter was a fair sample of those who went to comfort Job in his afflictions, and was wishing heartily that she would take herself away, so she made no further comments nor longer dis- puted with her neighbor. "Ugh! but that Martin-and he is sich a divil of a fel'ow when he gits to drink. I have tried to keep him from it, but sometimes he doesn't give up all the money he airned, and then he's sure to be off on a spree." And she folded her little hands behind her and walked thoughtfully across the room. She had a tiny, plump hand, all dimpled over, just such a hand as any modern belle might covet, although she seemed utterly uncon- scious of the fact herself, and never tried to show it off to the best advantage, either in the presence of Martin or others. She did not stop to say that she always wisely appropriated the money that poor Martin was compelled to give up; but then that was business of their own, and so it's nothing to us. "Now jist see the like o' that!" continued the fat little woman, as a span of horses with wagon rushed wildly past. Martin had evidently come in this particu- lar direction, and entirely away from his accustomed work, that Kitty might have the pleasure of seeing him. But it was not a very pleasant sight, for the besotted wretch reeled back and forth, and was at any moment   VA NQ UI$SED- LIFE DREAN .    237 liable to have his brains knocked out at some abrupt turn in the road, and in such a reckless drive. "And ye see that there's worse things than death, as I told you," muttered Mrs. Rogan, as she hastened in pur- suit. "And I'm fearful fraid the bastes will be hurt at sich a: pace. Och! that dreadful man!" Rena was alone again, and with weak and trembling limbs went back to attend to her evening cares. She tried to shake off the wretched feelings that were brood- ing over her soul. She tried to ridicule and hold in suited contempt the ridiculous superstitions of her lowly neigh- bor, but all her efforts proved unavailing. And as the shades of night crept around her, that cloud, which per- haps at first was not larger than a man's hand, had rapidly gained in proportion, and now loomed dark and threateningly above her. But it would be impossible to describe the mental terror of that night. It would baffle the descriptive powers of any tongue or pen. She had lightly hooted at the silly stories told her, and yet through the long and dismal hours of the night in im- agination she could hear a familiar voice calling, "Rena, Rena," or see some frightful looking form, usually without a head, sheltered in the shadowy corners of her chamber. Phil slept quietly beside her, and she was glad to see him oblivious of his childish troubles, but there was no sleep, no rest for her! Kitty had long since returned with the unruly Martin and the " bastes," and was attending to the wants of the latter while the former slunk silently away. Her voice rang out clear and shrill upon the inight air as she gave    <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6632-00000120"/> 238     LINDE,. ILL; OR, THE her peremptory commands td the poor, decrepid old creature, who hobbled around in a frightened manner to do her bidding. "Here, Aunt. I tell ye, Aunt, can't ye fetch that pail here to-night?" The timid old woman, drawing near, meekly extended her bony hand with the required vessel, but she instantly shrank back again with a nervous kind of start, which showed that she stood in awe of the commanding little woman before her. And had Rena seen her thus, well might she have fancied gobblins near, for imagination could not well conjure up anything that looked more ghost-like than she did, standing there in that frightened, ready-to-vanish-away manner. Her broad, white cap- frill was blown back by the evening breeze from a sallow and witch-like looking face, and her nervous fingers kept up an involuntary movement, as if seeking to clutch at something for protection. "Ho, Bobtail!" sang out the sharp voice, as she sought to wash the wounds of a huge, uncouth animal, whose stub of a tail would seem to indicate that he had come from a region where flies were not very numerous. "I say, can't ye stand still there, Bobtail!" But the work was all finished at last, and Bobtail led away to his oats, while the timid old woman crept silently into her little cot to dream. But surely she would be afraid to venture out into the unexplored land of dreams, and so we can only say, she went to rest! "Was your husband hurt yesterday?" asked Mrs.   VPANQ&amp;ISiiED LIFE-DREAlM.     239 Howard, as she paused for a moment in front of their dwelling. "Faith, and yer honor, no," was the reply; " but poor Bobtail, I'm fearful he'll not be able to do a bit of work for quite a while. Ah! its jist like the work o' that Mar- tin. But come in, come in; ye look pale and tired-out like," she insisted, as she drew her neighbor into the yard. Now jist sit right down on this cheer and rest awhile. Och! but ye've not ght the nerve that Kitty has, or ye'd not wilt down so under a little trouble. What would ye do now if your troubles were only sich as me own are?" The old lady shrank back further into the corner as Rena entered, although she was at that moment upon her knees, busily engaged in counting over a string of beads and droning over a form of prayer. "Faith, and the other troubles of me don't seem to be quite enough, and so Aunt has to help them on," con- tinued the spokeswoman glibly, as she saw Rena look in that direction. "She's been takin-on now because she thinks she might die soon, and wanted to go to church this morning, but I told her that she could pray jist as well at home as at church. Don't you think so, mum?" "It- seems so," she responded, at the same time re- membering that it was the very essence of Kitty's religion to go to church.' The week was usually passed in the most worldly and unbridled manner, but when Sunday or a holy-day was ushered in, she could almost invariably be seen trigged up with frizzes and ruffles, as she and Martin walked with the utmost decorum to the church of their fathers.    <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6632-00000121"/> 240     L INDEN IIILL; OR, THE Mrs. Howard's heart felt a thrill of sincere pity as she glanced toward the object of their conversation, who sat there with a wild indifference, as though she heeded no- thing that was passing. Perchance the old creature's yearning heart felt the need of something deeper and more substantial to rest upon than she had ever known, and Rena longed to offer somne words of consolation. But how could she offer to another that which she did not herself possess-even the joys of a heavenly peace? "I told her on the last holy-day that she need not ask me again," remarked Mrs. Rogan, resuming the subject. ' "Och! and that was a wonderful day though; a solemn time to be sure." "But what is it for?" asked Rena, ignorantly. "What does it commemorate? You see I am extremely ignor- ant in regard to such matters." "Ah! but it's the wake of the Holy Virgin, mum; and we ought to feel exceedingly solemn when we think how she must have suffered in seeing her Son bruised and bleeding! Faith, and it was a solemn time!" Rena was not at all certain that such was the real im- port of the day, for she well knew that her informant was not the most reliable authority, being so utterly illiterate and uninformed. Kitty Rogan's faith, if she could be said to possess faith at all, was all circumscribed in old women's fables, or goblin stories, and the traditions that had been handed down. We would not intimate that all who regard these days and seasons are similar to her, for we are sure that many who hold these things are both cultivated and refined.   VANQUISHEI D LIFE-DREAM.     241 But in vain did the eye scan table, shelf or bureau of that dwelling in search of books, for not a book or mag- azine was there-not even the Bible was to be seen. "Ugh! and ye needn't be afeared to stop a bit," was remarked, as Rena picked up her hati to go. My boy will miss me when he wakes," was the reply. ,'You see that children are sure to bring one in at a proper time." "And a heap of trouble they are, too. I have had five of them, but they're all gone now. and I'm not sorry for it. It will only leave the more property to be used for the good of our souls when we are gone." Rena smiled at the weakness of the expression, but she felt that if possessions were needful to benefit souls, their supply would be but limited with two such sin- scarred souls as theirs. "And 'ye must come agin; indade ye must," insisted Kitty. "We're only common now, but we've been used to better days, to be sure," and she laughed a coarse, rude laugh, as if to prove that her education had been thorough. "Thank you, but I seldom go out," was the reply, as she cast a look of pitying tenderness upon the shrinking old woman, and then hurried away. The day was wearing away and yet no news from Philip, and the fears which beset her, augmented by the frightful stories which she had heard, had wrought exces- sively upon her nerves. The previous night had been passed in wakefulness, and hature-having been so long robbed of her needful    <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6632-00000122"/> 242     LINDEIV  ILL; OR, THE rest-had it not been for the stimulant of fever, would have been utterly prostrate. She threw herself upon a sofa, and exhausted nature, that could bear no more, was soon cradled in the arms of slumber. How long she had been sleeping she never knew, when a gaunt form in the open doorway awoke her, saying: "Can you do anything for a poor, old woman?" "I have nothing to give," Rena answered, for in her half sleepy condition she scarcely knew what she was saying, and at the moment had supposed the intruder to be no less than a common street beggar. In an instant the suppliant turned and as noiselessly glided away. The feelings of drowsiness instantly van- ished. She arose from the sofa, where her child still lay lost in slumber, realizing in an instant that it was the in- dividual upon whom, only a short time before, she had bestowed unavailing pity. Bult whatever might have been the extent of her wrongs and sufferings, it was her last appeal for help. Like a frightened bird, she again nestled down in the only covert that earth seemed to offer without sending forth either cry or moan. It must be a sad, sad thing for the heart to be thus driven back to itself for comfort, and especially when it has no stronger fortress than this world can offer-to look forward and see no way of deliverance from the sorrows and hardships of a dreary, friendless life but through the dark, cold grave! And then that grave, how dismal- no, not the grave, for it is all quiet there, but beyond that undesired goal-how mysterious everything appears! How the faculties of nature shrink from it all as from a   VANQUISIIED LIFE-DREAM.      243 spectre, and yet earnestly long to be away from a scene in which there is neither light nor joy! There is a light which is capable of illuminating and even beautifying the most desert wastes of life down here; but this is only an emanation from the bright realms above, where the weary one knows his treasures are held in reserve, and are faithfully guarded. And the thought that the rugged path will soon be all behind is sufficient to sweeten many a bitter cup that sin so often presses to our lips, when, without that sweetening thought, it would prove but a nauseating draught. And even the region of the damned itself would be stripped of half its horrors could the wretched inhabitants there know that their sufferings were not eternal. Those sufferings might be prolonged through thousands or even tens of thousands of years, and still a ray of light would gleam through the blackness of eter- nal darkness could they but know that the fires of perdi- tion would eventually be quenched, and that light and joy were in reser"e. beyond! Forever! How lightly the word is often spoken, and yet what we^l or woe is suspended upon the realities of forever! It brightens the Christian's anticipated glory; but oh! when awake to an understanding of its real import it will- only augment the horrors of hell and the gnawings of that worm of conscience that shall live forever! "There's papa now," cried the child, as he ceased to rub his sleepy eyes, and gliding off the lounge he clapped his little hands exultingly. " O mamma, papa's not sick, and now you won't cry any more!"

"How could he be so heartless as to leave me so?" she inwardly suggested, cc and especially when he knew the delicate state of my health?" "You have been a little uneasy about me, I hear," he remarked. "Don't you think I am large enouglh to take care of myself?" "I think you do very wrong," she responded, dryly. "You seem to have but little regard for another's feel- ings." "Rena, I thought that you knew all about it, and never knew any better until I reached town. That scoundrel promised to send my letter right away." It is astonishing how quick a fear can pass away and the heart grow strong and hopeful. Mrs. Howard could- now laugh at the fear that only a short time before had assumed such frightful forms, and the husband never dreamed of such depths of anguish as had for days en- compassed her very soul. "I thought perhaps your neighbor, Mrs. Rogan, would keep you company," remarked Philip, as that personage left the house with a pitcher of fresh, sweet milk. "' I see that she comes in frequently." "O, she's a perfect old heathen, and sometimes I dread to see her come," was the response, as supper was announced, and they passed into an adjoining room. "And, Philip, I actually believe that she treats that-poor, old, friightened-looking woman badly."

It does not concern us, however, and we will just let them work out their own affairs." "But she looks so pitiful, Philip; it makes me sorry whenever I look at her." "I know it, and I expect she is to be pitied; but then we had best not interfere with their family matters." "But I don't like to live so near them. He is a low, brutish man, and she is a perfect virago. I never saw her equal." Rena had forgotten that Kitty Rogan was really kind at times, and in her own peculiar way. It their ways were different, whose fault was that? Should we not ap- preciate kindness in whatever shape it comes, and not look beyond it to see the uncouth appearance or pecu- liarities of the one who proffers it? Had she not, in con- sideration of Rena's delicate appetite, brough in an occa- sional dish of the most fragrant soup, because, as she said, "one could always irelish that which was cooked away from home best," and we must say in Kitty's praise that she was al most excellent hand at the business of soup-making? But after hearing that her neighbor boiled eggs for breakfast in her coffee-boiler along with the coffee for the family, and prepared things in, general after the same fashion, she used to set the delicate dish aside,    <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6632-00000124"/> 246     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE though with becoming thankfulness, at least in words, and wait for a coming appetite, which was sure to never come. Mrs. Howard was undoubtedly unthankful at heart for these little acts of kindness, which, however trivial in themselves, had they been given by one possessing more lady-like refinement, and one whom she in reality re- spected, would have proved as incense offerings to her desponding heart. But is it not right to treasure up gems regardless of the place where they may be found? What if Mrs. Rogan was superstitious and peculiar, did she not have her faults, too? And she professed to " have the spirit of Christ," without which none are His But did He ever pass with indifference the least act of kindness from even the low- liest of earth? Of course, Kitty had her faults-who has not? But shall I say, "Let me pull the mote out ot your eye " when there is a beam in my own? I know that it is but natural for us to make such propositions, or else pass with contempt our neighbor who is uncon- sciously in possession of the mote. The magnitude of the beam in my own eye so darkens my inward vision that I cannot be expected to judge of my own defects through the dim light it offers, and so I take it for granted that I have none. "Her conversation is all made up from ghost stories," continued Rena, and it is enough to frighten one almost to death to listen to them."

"I don't think we will be bothered with them long, as the place does not seem well suited for the work.

A little, dark-palled coffin was placed beside the couch, and the pale mother gazed with a lingering look of ten- derness upon the seemingly blighted flower that lay so quietly therein. It was only a tiny thing-a new-born child which had but just opened its bright eyes upon this toilsome, weary world, and then, as if disgusted with the whole fickle scene, closed them upon the cares of earth forever! But to the mother's heart it was no trifling bereave- ment. The anguish of the past was forgotten, and fbr the time the thoughts of death and judgment vanished when they placed that little one upon her bosom, and with true maternal pride she even then exultantly looked forward into the fancied future of her beloved children. But the Giver of all good gifts had seen proper to take this one to himself, and there was no alternative wi;h her but submission, whether willing or not.   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      249 "Let us take it away now, Mrs. Howard," whispered the thoughtful neighbor, compassionately. "This excite- ment is too much for you." "Not yet, Mrs. Marks, responded Rena, as her pale hand stroked lovingly the little brow so cold in death. "It's my last look. Please give me time to photograph this little image upon my memory." "Just think how much better off it is," continued her companion, seeking to lull the maternal grief that the welling tears portrayed. "I have lost three little ones, and can now thank God for having taken them away, although it was terribly hard to give them up at first. Samuel thought he could never stand it to have them go, but now he often says that he feels thankful that it was so; and I know that I feel a sight better satisfied about them than I do about the ones still living." The bereaved mother said no more, for she had nothing more to say. She could not understand how a person could be thankful that her children were taken away, and yet she could not see why she should wish them} to live, only to reap life's bitter harvest! Why is it that the Christian parent will thus limit God's love and power? Is not that power which is able to take a part of the family circle to himself equally able to shelter the remainder of those loved ones under the covert of his love? Why cannot faith trust in that One who has power to save not only " thee," but also " thy house."

Such is the privilege-nay, even is requested of them--even of those who, through faith, have been born of God. "Ask and ye shall receive." If, through the finished work of the cross, himself has been cleansed from sin, surely God does not limit the worth of that atoning blood. It is as free for the child as for the adult; as free for the deepest-dyed sinner as for the favored moralist. As in the case of Abraham, when pleading with God for the doomed inhabitants ot Sodom, we are too much afraid of drawing too heavily upon God. Can we never learn that there is no limit to the wealth of his love and goodness, and that no check signed by the hand of faith will ever be protested at that inexhaustible bank of heaven? We are not to ask "wavering;" for such a one need not expect to receive anything, but to ask in faith, knowing that God's love is reaching out after those little ones, more than a parent's can ever do, saying, "suffer them to come unto me." "Philip first findeth his own brother, Simon Peter, and bringeth him to Jesus." We too may seek some brother or child and bear them in the arms of faith to Jesus-not trusting in reforming his habits or looking at the amend' ments in his life, but simply by gazing through the misty scenes intervening toward Him who said, "And whatso. ever ye shall ask in my name, believing, ye shall receive.', Blessed assurance!

The tree had not then been revealed whereby all this bitter- ness could be removed, as was found near Marah's bitter waters; and no wonder that without this " branch of heal- ing" her soul refused to drink. The waters of earthly enjoyment can never perfectly satisfy the thirsty soul, else why should man be ever Seeking new streams of pleasure to satisfy his insatiate thirst? But when once that blood- stained '" tree " of Calvary is by faith descried, it sweet- ens every bitter taste and lulls the murmurs of this wil- derness below. She gazed long and lovingly upon the blighted little flower, until its baby face was again concealed beneath the coffin lid and borne from that cottage-home forever! She then buried her face in her hands, but not to say, "although he cannot return to me, I shall one day go to him," for she felt that the parting was perhaps forever! Philip pressed a kiss upon her cheek in mute sympathy, and then left the room to follow the little one to its "narrow house "-the grave. It was a quiet retreat, uninterrupted by the busy tumult of the surrounding world, and seeming to inspire one with a mysterious awe as if it were consecrated by the presence of death! Philip Howard seemingly stood alone amid the falling leaves of that chilly autumn day, and for once thought that " man's life was indeed but as the flower of the grass," coming forth as a tender plant, and, in this in-    <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6632-00000127"/> 252     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE stance, nipped by the frosts of death m the very bud.

But these solemn thoughts were only a momentary ripple upon the swift current of his worldly thoughts, and he turned away from the little grave of their sleeping child to go back into the busy pursuits of life again! How many do the same! How little the cessation of one life affects this hurrying, bustling world of ours, or leaves a real impression upon the mind of the mortality of man! How many the lives of greater note and with numerous years are soon forgotten, and the tide of busy life pushes onward as though they had never been I It is not a pleasant thought to dwell upon, but such is, in- deed, the fickle nature of mankind. But however heart- less this may all appear, may it not in reality be for the best?

"Is papa's pet ' tired and sleepy too?"'" asked Philip Howard, as he lifted the little toddler upon his knee and smoothed down his silken curls. "When mamma can't see after him, I fear my boy is neglected. See how soon he falls asleep," he continued, addressing the mother, who sat in an easy chair beside him. She smiled faintly as they watched the blue eyes close: wearily, and soon completely overcome with drowsiness, he slumbered peacefully in his father's arms. But she   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      253 thought of another darling one, who but a few weeks before they had taken to the dreary graveyard. A shud- der crept over her form as she thought of the cold, bleak winds that since then had swept over his lonely little bed. "Do you think I shall be able to ride soon?" she asked, looking up from the gloomy picture she had just been contemplating. ' I hope so," was the quiet rejoinder; " but where do you want to go?" "To baby's grave," she answered in a low tone. "It seems so cold and lonely for it there alone."' A shadow crossed his face for a moment, but he only pressed the hand that rested upon the arm of her chair in silence. "When I have seen where my baby sleeps, I must visit Mrs. Marks," she continued. "Poor Mary! She has been very attentive, and I shall not forget her kindness. And Madge was here to-day, wanting us to come soon. I don't know but she wanted to take us along with her." "I have thought," he remarked, after a brief silence, "that if Madge was here all the time with her wild, crude notions, it would help to drive away the monotony of your life. Don't you think so, Rena?" "I can't'tell," she responded, with the same distant, desponding look that she so often'wore. "Well, as soon as you are able, you shall 6visit them." Philip replied, hastily, as-if wishing to drive away her gloomy expression, at the same time tucking the child snugly away in his little bed and seating himself upon her footstool.

"Philip, home is the brightest place on earth to me when you are here," she responded sadly, "but you don't know how intolerable life becomes when tied down with nothing but the society of Tom and Bridget to while away the time." "But you must visit your friends oftener and be more sociable," he continued encouragingly. "I hope the time will soon come when I can be at home more. You know I would like it." "Then why not do so?" she mentally ejaculated, but her lips gave no utterance. "I do hope you will not allow yourself to get so low- spirited any more. It makes me miserable to see you so, and does you no good." "Philip, I believe that this melancholy is constitu- tional," she answered in a decided tone. "I have tried to overcome these horrible forebodings, that in your pres- ence seem ridiculous to myself, but it is no use to fight against fate, for they will continue to haunt me in spite of every effort." But he could not understand these turns of mental de- rangement, and therefore, as before, left them to the cat- alogue of womanish weaknesses and peculiar whims, that could only be cured by maturer years. And thus life dragged wearily along, with sometimes the cloud lifted from the horizon of her mental sky, for a brief time, and then again gathering more appalling darkness!   VANQ 4 UISHED LIFE-DREAM.     255 Alas! how shamefully this life, with all its blessings, is abused! The youth who is hopefully climbing the rugged steep stoops not to treasure up the many precious gems as he goes along, but hurls them heedlessly to the pass- ing winds, vainly expecting to find something more wor- thy-something upon which his weary soul can rest when he reaches the summit of manhood's ambition! But he finds it not, for the nature of man is such, that that which at first can be momentarily satisfied with a trifling toy, gradually expands and cries for more. The heart of man is but the grave of earthly joy, as far as his own enjoyment of it is concerned, for its attrac- tive loveliness immediately vanishes, and if in after time it chances to be revealed, it is only presented in some ghostly form, telling of what might have been. Have not all, in some degree at least, experienced this? We know that cavilers will tell us that the world holds all that is needful for man's happiness. If this were true, is man content with the wealth of blessings it be- stows? Who has not felt that if he could gain this or that wealth or accomplishment it would satisfy the crav- ings of the heart within, but when he obtained the cov- eted treasure his soul was just as empty as before! Not one whose mind has been. illuminated with the light of an ordinary intelligence but will acknowledge this axiom. And the problem solved, which the light of reason can never simplify, is this: the soul which is formed for eternity can never be satisfied with the things of time!

A shadow, a delusion. These flowers, if cared for, might have lent a fragrance to life's weary journey; why so eager to pass them by? He has reached the top and found a void, a promise unfulfilled, and, as he wends his way down the still more rugged descent, he involuntarily turns his thoughts to the quiet haunts of those crushed and withered flowers; but they are gone now, and their fragrance wasted on a desert air. We look with amazement upon the prodigal who squanders his golden ore regardless of its value; but how vast the number of precious moments, far more val- uable than gold, are squandered thoughtlessly away, never to be recalled! We not unfrequently hear persons talk of " killing time" in frivolous amusements, but, doubtless, in more than one instance they have been made to exclaim, "A world of wealth for an inch of time." There is nothing but the love of God, as revealed in the person of Jesus Christ, that can satisfy the- expansive soul of man. He has and is still trying everything else, and to no purpose; but when the eye, tired and discour- aged with life's vain pursuits, can look up and see the beauty of God's grace, his compassionate condescension, through love of ruined man, is it not enough to satisfy the soul? And it will satisfy in proportion as the things of earth are not allowed to intervene and shut out the face of the Son of God. The gloomy clouds of day may conceal the face of earth's brilliant luminary-the sun-- but they do not lessen its brightness. And in proportion   VAN Q UISHED LIFE-DREA M.      257 as those beams are shut away from our little world, that derives its light and warmth from that glorious orb, are earth's fields of vegetation dwarfed and blighted. And this is just the condition of the child of God. Unless a careful watch is maintained the clouds of worldly lust come in and hide the heavenly glories as revealed in that compassionate face, which but for self-wrought obstacles, would ever beam upon him. The earth may possess all the geological properties necessary for bringing forth flower and fruit, but without the benign influence of the sun what would the result be?  And the Christian, although a temple wherein the Holy Ghost deigns to dwell, is but a man "subject to like passions" as others, and, unless walking in the unclouded light of the pres- ence of God, can never produce the fruits of righteous- ness. But "he that sayeth He abideth in him ought himself also to walk as He (Christ) walked." What was the character of that walk? Surely if it had been in accordance with the mind of the world he would not have been cast out, for "the world will ever love its own." It was in separation from the world's plans and projects, and just in proportion as the Christian enters into the world's schemes, speculations or politics, are the fruits of Christianity dwarfed and blighted, and himself shadowed from the light of the Sun of righteous- ness by earthly obstacles he himself has reared. The Christian profession is to-have fellowship with God, and "if we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not tell the truth."- It is a fearful picture to draw, and one that is likely to    <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6632-00000130"/> 258     LI-NDEN HILL; OR, TH E offend the person who is not willing to walk in that "straight and narrow way," but it is God's truth and not man's.

But to return to our tale. We will not try to recount the trials of those dreary years of Rena Howard's life ere "her dark distrust, the famine time, was over." She continued to walk quietly beneath the heavy shadows of self-gathered clouds, dividing her affections equally among the living and the dead, and finding little or no happiness in either. The little grave grew to be an almost forgotten spot to all except herself, and the flow- s  ers bloomed and faded that her own hands had carefully planted upon it, and still she plodded onward through the surrounding darkness, cold and calm outwardly, but with neither peace nor joy within. The duties of the wife and mother were ever faithfully performed, but there was no sunshine in the heart to gladden the surrounding household. And what a cheerless, dreary place is home without its sunshine or in-door brightness? How pre- ferable the region of polar snow and ice when a cheerful, happy heart beats in the bosom to the many chilling homes of other latitudes, even though surrounded   VAf4NQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      259 with all that wealth can procure. How difficult for the little heart to expand into a warm, true man or woman- hood when surrounded by such an atmosphere! The child wants parental smiles revealed and cheerful greet- ings, and this same home sunlight is the only reliable safeguard against the wily temptations that beset him in the outside world. It is easily produced, being simply the fruits of self-forgetting love and the seeking to pro- mote the happiness of others, regardless of the position self may occupy, and hiding real trials, that the lives of loved ones may not be darkened by their presence. It had been well for her happiness had Rena Howard thus understood this treacherous setf-love; but she did not, and so continued to tenderly nurse her heart sorrows. And not even when little Selton, another fair-haired pen- sioner upon her love and protection, was sent to fill the place of the one whom God had taken away, was she ready to take up life's burdens as they came, rejoicing even that they were no more grievous to be borne.    <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6632-00000131"/> 260     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE CHAPTER XXII. APPREHENSIONS. Her cheek was pale, but resolved and high Was the word of her lip and the glance of her eye. Sir Walter Seoit. "Don't keep Tom any longer, Philip; he and Bridget are all the time plotting together, and I am sure they in- tend something wrong." There was a tinge of shame visible upon Mrs. How- ard's face as she uttered these words, for, as usual, in her husband's presence, she felt ashamed of such weakness, but sach dreadful mental visions had flitted before her imagination of late, when he was absent, that she could no longer forbear to speak about it. "Why, Rena Howard, how foolish you are!" he an- swered, impatiently. "I'm really ashamed to see you act so child-like." "But, Philip, I can't help it," she replied, feeling a choking sensation in her throat. "I am afraid of them both, and as ' there is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed, neither covered that shall not be made mani- fest,' I'm certain that a time is coming when my appre- hensions will be proved to be no merely idle fears."   VA NQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      261 "What have they done to cause such alarm?" he queried, in a tone of marked displeasure. "I can see no reason whatever for such fancies. "Oh! everything-I don't know what," was the con- fused rejoinder; for although Tom was an unprincipled fellow, when she came to sum up the reasons, beside her own morbid fancies, there was really little to say. "But he treats me with a perfect disrespect whenever you are away. Only the other day, when I reproved him for misconduct, he intimated that he was a dangerous per- son, whether people believed it or not, as he was very much given to walking in his sleep of nights, and might all unconsciously be revenged." "Why didn't you tell him to shut his mouth and leave your presence?" answered the husband, and the indig- nation of his heart was visible in- the flash of his eye. "The low, dastardly hound knew you were afraid of him, and only talked that way to try to frighten you, and you should have made him know his place at once." "But, Philip, I was afraid to," she continued, with quivering lips. "He knows that I am afraid, I'm sure, and whenever called to perform any work about the house, he and Bridget are continually holding low con- sultations, that their looks tell refer to myself." "I think that you are unnecessarily suspicious, Rena," he remarked, after a few minutes' silence. "Their con- versation, doubtless, refers to some of their own Irish wakes or absolutions, which they knew would be distaste- ful to you; but I will allow no more such insolence from Tom; rest assured of that."    <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6632-00000132"/> 262     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "But do send him away, husband," she continued, pleadingly. "I shall always feel like I was walking through a horrid nightmare while he is near me." "Rena, I don't see how I could do without him just now," was the prompt rejoinder. I have never seen any one who would so faithfully attend to every duty in- trusted to his care as Tom; and now, when my business is in such a condition as to compel me to be absent from home so much, it would seem the heighth of folly to send him away just for a childish fancy that he premeditated something wrong. It is all imagination, darling, and you must not allow yourself to think of it." The words were not spoken in a very decided tone, and yet the wife felt that further appeal was useless. She knew that he was as far from understanding her feelings as he was from entering into the sentiments of Tom, and it only augmented the wretched feelings of loneliness and isolation that already beset her. What did he, with his self-reliant boldness that feared neither man nor apparition, know of a weak woman's nervous fears? Absolutely nothing; and she felt that she was indeed shut up alone to battle with her misery. She tried to choke back the tears that were struggling for freedom, but crushing down all traces of that inward emotion from her usually stern, cold face, was an arduous task even for her. "I can't see what has ever caused you to feel such a horror of Tom," he continued, seeing that she was not much disposed for further conversation. U You ought to know that he has no spite against you. Why should he wish to harm you?"   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      263 "Because it is in his heart," she answered, lifting her heavy eyes to his tace. "If you are anything of a phre- nologist you can see that he has the perfect organs of a murderer's head! You need not laugh, for all the powers of earth combined could never convince me that I am mistaken! But if you are willing, notwithstanding all this, to trust me and your child in his power, I don't see why I need care. And remember now, come what may, I have made the last appeal to you upon this subject that shall ever pass my lips." Rena looked the personification of stoical indifference as she uttered these words. A fear of ridicule, as well as a natural peculiarity which caused her to treasure in her own bosom the various hopes and fears of life, had before often closed her lips; but now that what he had termed her "foolish fancies" had been expressed and seemingly disregarded, pride came again to her assistance, and she was suddenly transformed into her former cold self. She would show him "How sublime a thing it is To suffer and be strong." There was not even any of that recent weakness of body visible now that so often revealed itself in her trembling limbs, and she felt that she could bear any bur- -den that either God or man might see fit to impose upon her, without asking the pity of any. "What would you say to our taking Madge Marks into the family now," Philip asked at length, breaking the awkward silence that was beginning to be unpleasant.    <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6632-00000133"/> 264     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "'Don't you think it would be more pleasant for you when I'm away?" "You can do just as you please," she answered icily. "It is a matter of little importance to me." There was a repelling coldness in her look, as well as tone, which was not calculated to soften the husband's heart, and taking advantage of his usual subterfuge when anything unpleasant was going on, he took his hat and sauntered from the room. Rena seated herself upon the doorstep and watched with listless gaze where the rays of the setting sun gilded the tops of the lofty trees that graced the cottage door- way. It was a picture of surpassing loveliness. The quiet village lying just below, all curtained, save the ascending spires, from the fading sunbeams by the verdant hills beyond. But there was nothing refreshing for the weary soul in the gentle breeze that swept away the sultry breath of a hot July day, nor in the peaceful hum from the thankful villagers, as the sound fell upon her ear. Her eye gazed far away adown the sloping hill and over the wide, wide prairie, where the many snug farm-houses looked so diminutive in the distance, and this, with the dark strip of woodland intervening, presented that pic- ture of beauty that might well cause a thrill in the artist's or poet's heart. But it was only another example of the power the heart possesses over the eye, for all charm was lost to the weary mother as she sat in sullen solitude. "Seltie's sleepy, mamma," lisped the little one, as he toddled wearily across the room and sank upon her lap, "Seltie's tired and seepy too- So put me in my itty bed."   VANQUISHED LI:FE-DREAM.      265 The mother instantly awoke from her unhappy reverie to attend to the wants of her children, who, refreshed by their evening bath, were soon sleeping peacefully, forget- ful of the many baby trials which had beset their path through that long summer's day. The rest of the house- hold were soon resting in the same quiet embrace, but for herself slumber was not so easily won. The moon shone brightly above, and the broad, dark shadows fell noiselessly upon her window sill, while she tossed nervously upon her bed and wished for the mor- row's coming. And it was even near the morning's hour before the coveted blessing came, and then not to give rest, but only to cause more disquiet to the already over- burdened soul. "What is the matter?" ejaculated Philip, giving her a vigorous shake just as the grey dawn of morning was peering through the casement. "Your horrid screeches would remind one of the wail of a lost spirit, for I'm sure I never heard more unearthly sounds." She opened her eyes with a bewildered stare, which, however, was soon exchanged for a smile born of a thank- ful heart. But thankful to whom or to what? 'Did she in- deed thank God that her horrible dream was not a reality, or was it joy that returning reason had dispelled her dis- mal fears? "Oh! I've had such a terrible dream," she murmured, "and it all seemed so real. It frightened me terribly." "One would readily suppose that," was the jocund re- sponse; " but did you dream that you were falling from a precipice with nothing but grass to catch at?" 17    <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6632-00000134"/> 266     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "Worse than that," was answered, and a shade of sad- ness again stole back into her face. "Philip, do you never fear the judgment day--fear to meet God with an unsettled account?" she interrogated. i"Rena, I never think of it. I guess I am a sinner, at least the preachers call such as me sinners; but never in my life have I felt the least afraid to die." "Well, I can't understand you," she answered. with a puzzled expression. ( From my earliest recollection this dread has always hung over me like a dark cloud. I have tried and tried to live in such a manner that I might be enabled to rise above it, but it only grows blacker and blacker as I go along." ' Did you dream that you were dying, and made those screeches to try to frighten the ' grim monster, death,' away?" was laughingly queried. "No," she answered, in a pensive tone. "For although death would be such an unwelcome guest, I know well enough that he cannot be frightened away, I cannot- understand myself why death is so dreadful to me, for my life has never seen much happiness, even from my earliest years." He made no reply, for he could not see why she was not happy. He considered himself happy, and did not once think that his continual reaching out after something more proved the falsity of such a statement. "I must have been troubled with a nightmare, or something of the kind, when you woke me so uncere- moniously," Mrs. Howard continued, after a brief silence, "but my dream at the first was so very plain. I saw myself   VANQUISHED L'.E-DREAM.      267 back in that familiar old farm-house, just as it was in child- hood. My mother's pale face was as clearly portrayed as if she had been really before me, and her soft, low voice and feeble step were just as they used to be so long ago. The picture seemed like an undisputed reality, with everything in its accustomed place. Even the well- worn spinning-wheel, upon which the coarser fabrics for home use had been spun while the imagination was busy with threads of a finer texture, was standing in its undis- puted corner, and all the dear, familiar faces were beam- ing with pleasure upon me. 'My heart felt a deep thrill of joy at the thought of again being back among the scenes that I once spurned for their very simplicity, but the many years of trial intervening between now and then seemed only a dark, unhappy dream." Rena closed her eyes and remained silent for a moment, as if she would recall those scenes and photograph them more fully upon her heart.

I felt that the time had come for mne to meet my Judge, and O, I would have rejoiced to have 'the rocks and mountains fall upon me,' to hide me from His face! It was just in the midst of this fearful dilemma when you called me; but although I am thankful that it was only a dream, it does not leave a desirable impression upon my mind." "Nonsense, Rena; you are getting to be a perfect baby," Philip remarked, as he pushed his foot into his slipper. "Are you going to allow every childish dream and fancy to worry you in this manner? .When I was a child I used to dream of being chased by bulls, or other mad animals, and would be almost frightened out of my wits; but I left all such childish dreams- in the lap of childhood." "But, Philip, these fears are not childish; the child in early life is not afraid of a judgment day, for it is men that are 'judged for the deeds' done in the body, and, consequently, the child, until he is guilty of actual trans- gression, can have nothing to fear. God, you know, can never judge the child for being born in sin, when it is not responsible for it. These are not childish fears, however childish they may make me appear."

HOUSEHOLD CARES. "Why give you me this shame? Think you I can a resolution fetch From flowery tenderness? If I must die I will encounter darkness as a bride, And hug it in my arms." --Shakspeare. "Don't talk to me about an overruling Providence, Bessie. I often doubt the existence of a God; and if there is such a Being, one who rules with such a merci- less rod can never be a God of love." "Why, Rena, how wildly you talk!" ejaculated the sis- ter, with a look of amazement. "I don't know what to think of your wild talk. Surely the adversary has found a weak place in your armor, and is assailing you at that point." "If there be anything but weak points, I don't know it," was responded, with an indifferent grace. "But I have been walking in this dull, lifeless religious state long enough. I shall wear this cloak of formal Christianity no longer; and, if the world offers any enjoyment, rest assured that I shall eagerly accept it."   VANQ UISHED LIFE-DREAM.      271 x "What can you mean?" asked Bessie, in a still more bewildered manner. "I never heard you talk in this way before. Are you going crazy?" "No, Bessie; I'm only becoming sane. But the world is crazy, and exulting in it. It is walking by crowds, in religious concourses, loaded with duties, and formal rites, and ceremonies, without possessing a shadow of joy or peace. If there is such a thing as religion, it is not worth a straw if it does not lift one above the troubles and trials of this lite. But it has never lifted me above them, and such a religion I will claim no longer, for it is -noth- ing but an empty, lifeless, formal creed." c"Rena Howard, what does possess you? You have no more troubles than others. Don't all Christians have their dark hours?" "But they should not, if the thing is a genuine article," responded the enthusiastic speaker. "Why, if such is the case, are they told to 'rejoice always?' There seems, somehow, an incomprehensible inconsistency in profess- ing Christendom, and I don't pretend to understand it. I don't see one jot or tittle of difference between the pro- fessors of Christianity and those who are not. Their prospects seem to be the same, and their joys, if they have any, are all one. Look how the 'women professing godliness' try to outdo every one else in dress and par- ade. Is that Paul's model? Is that like sitting at the feet of Jesus? And the men, too--they scramble for money and position just as much as the world's profli- gate. The fact is, Bessie, if there is nothing more sub- stantial than what I possess, and what I think that nomi-    <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6632-00000137"/> 272     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE nal Christians in general have attained to, I shall unhesi- tatingly pronounce it all a farce, a shadow and a misera- ble delusion!" Bessie made no reply to this outhreak, and she was, indeed, really fearful that her sister's mental faculties were somewhat deranged, as she had never before known her to advocate such wild notions. Ever zealous to do this and avoid that, she considered Rena quite an orderly Christian-one who was consistent enough, surely even enough so to make her almost fogyish, for Bessie was by nature more light-hearted than her younger sister. But it was the law that was portrayed in her zealous religious life and not the Gospel. The shadows that enveloped Sinai were ever looming above her and making them- selves visible in all her best efforts, when the radiant light of God's grace and truth would have beautified that life as well as convinced others that Christianity was never intended to lessen our pleasures, but to augment them. She, too, sensibly felt the weight of the " curse of the law " resting upon her, and, through an unenlightened un- derstanding, thought it was God chastising her in anger, not as a father, but as a merciless tyrant. "If I am ever to be saved," she continued, in a some- what subdued tone of voice, "God will have to do it all. I have tried to go on in what I considered duties, rigidly adhering to what I thought would be beneficial; have tried to keep the law, have tried to ' break off my sins by righteousness,' and what has it all amounted to? If I am one of the ' elect' I shall be saved anyhow; and if not, what is the use in having torment in both worlds?"   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       273 "But election is through ' sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth'; if you refuse to believe this truth, you alone are responsible." "It may be so," she answered, somewhat bitterly; "but in the fixture I shall go my own way." "And where will that way be?" was queried, as Rena sat dreamily gazing from the open window of her sister's room. "You say that the world's happiness is not sub- stantial; I don't see where you are going to find the genuine article." "I'm sure I don't know. The Bible tells us that 'there is a way which seemeth right, but the end thereof is death.' I believe this is the way that I have been go- ing for these past years, and-I'll go it no longer. I know that these words can not refer to the path of open world- liness and sin, for the veriest simpleton would never say that such a way seemed right. It is evidently the formal religionist that is here addressed. This formal path of religious service seems right, and the world approves of it, although it is a constraint, and not the least particle of real. heart in it, and I believe that the greater part, if not all, professors are just in this condition. If they could but invent a machine to do their praying, it would prove a wonderful labor-saving invention; and the majority of them have machines for regulating their creeds and opin- ions in the person of some ministerial head." "Well, haven't you been just as bad as the rest?" asked Bessie, somewhat coldly. "You have surely for- gotten your great zeal for religion. In fact, I think you came well-nigh being a machine for regulating the opin-    <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6632-00000138"/> 274     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE ions of others, and was generally very anxious to wind them up and have them running according to your own views." "I know it," was the frank response, " and if they did not run according to order it was sure to offend me; and I don't expect anything else from others. They wound me up and started me running in their cold, formal duties; but I guess I must have clattered away too fast, for I'm just about run down, and am very certain that I'll never take another trial of it." "Rena, you are a natural curiosity," remarked the sis- ter; " but as you say you intend to go your own way in future, may I be privileged to ask where you will go?" "Lord, to whom but to Thee can we go!" sounded through her mind with trumpet-like distinctness. "Alas I where can I go?" was her mental ejaculation. "The words of eternal life are with Him, and my own weak reason tells me only too plainly that the world is bank- rupt and can give nothing of real worth." "Come, come, this is only a gloomy feeling that has taken possession of you to-day, and wle will dwell upon it no longer," remarked Bessie, lightly. ", We will not destroy the pleasure of your visit with such an unpleas- ant theme. See the children crowning baby with that wreath of flowers, and she seems to enjoy it, too. I like to see children enjoy the sunlight of childhood; there are no clouds to mar their happiness then." "That's all poetic fancy, Bessie. My childhood had just as great trials, in proportion to the strength of mind   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       275 to bear them, as after years have known. There was a shadow over me then, and it still rests above me." " fie! you don't try to get out of it; that is the trouble," answered Mrs. H., impatiently. "Come, let us get some of these tempting apples from that tree. I don't wonder at Eve eating the forbidden fruit if it looked as tempting as this before us now.." And thus the remainder of the day passed in pleasant conversation, with many a reminiscence of childist way- wardness recalled, many a bright prospect or plan for the future discussed, as the sisters sat together in the cool shade, until the lengthening shadows admonished Rena of the necessity of a return to the activities of home life, with its cheerless rounds of domestic care and perplexity as before. '"I am off again this morning," remarked Philip, upon the following day, after giving some hasty directions to the " man of all work," " and shall not be back for a fortnight, perhaps longer." Her eye instantly lost all its look of tenderness upon hearing this announcement, and met his own with a cold, unloving gaze. "I don't like to go so soon," he continued, in a kind of apologetic manner, "but I am neglecting my business shamefully, and must not loiter around in this fashion. But Madge Marks will be here; you will not be afraid to stay with her, will you?" "And how do you know she will come?" was queried, in a doubtful tone, but somewhat lightened heart.

Seltie; can't you and Phil take care of mam- ma when papa's gone?" he asked, stroking the flaxen curls that stood in wild disorder around the child's broad, white forehead. "I think my boys are large enough, if mamma would only believe it." "Can't Phil and I take care of you, mamma," asked the little one, as he sprang from his father's knee and nestled his little face against her bosom. "You won't look so crying any more, will you? Papa says we're big enough." She kissed the little fingers that sought to entangle themselves in the unbound tresses of her hair, but said nothing. "Come, give papa a ' good-bye kiss,' for he must go," remarked the father, as he again pressed the little ones to his bosom. "I must get my children something nice while I'm gone.' What shall it be?" "O, a pony, papa; get us a real, live pony," shouted both in one breath. "We want one just like the show- man had last summer, and it could do everything but talk; and I don't know but it could be learned to do that. O, won't we have a nice old time riding around," cried the enthusiastic children, forgetting the present in the bright expectations of the future. Philip looked with pride and admiration upon the hope-   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      2" ful boys-and what parent has not felt that his own were so far, in real worth, above the generality of children; and then telling them if they " wanted the pony, to be very good boys and not trouble mamma," he left them to their own plans and speculations. "Don't be low spirited now," he whispered, as he stooped to press a kiss upon the mother's unimpassioned lips. "I know its lonely, Abut throw all care to the winds and don't give way to those gloomy feelings." And in a moment more he was riding down the long, sloping hill that extended toward the village. Rena watched his retreating form as he rode away, and those dread, undefined feelings of fear began to take possession of her heart as the outlines grew more and more indistinct, and then faded entirely from her view. What if Madge should fail to come. A thousand vague thoughts flitted through her brain only to give place to the multitudes of coming thoughts, each more wild and fearful than its predecessor. "And I wish, ma'am, that ye'd just look after Master Phil," said Bridget, in a curt tone, breaking the thread of her wild dreams, as she poked her head in at the half- open door. "I'll declare in the name of St. Peter that I niver saw the like of him in all my life." "What is the matter?" asked Mrs. Howard, as she entered Bridget's dominion to investigate the difficulty. ' "Why, Biddy won't let me have any nails, and I must have some," cried indignant Phil, towering up to his full height and looking the picture of injured innocence.    <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6632-00000140"/> 278     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "And what do you want with the nails?" she asked, somewhat puzzled to understand his earnest manner.

"Papa said that he would get us one, and we want the stable all ready when he comes; and Seltie's going to pull grass and dry it for his hay. O, but we're going to have everything ready for certain." "Give him a few nails, Bridget, and let them amuse themselves," remarked the mother, as she smiled at the visionary scheme of the young enthusiasts, and away they bounded to hasten their self-imposed task. And the work of the young carpenters went on briskly for a time, until the glow of their ardor had somewhat abated, while the mother turned away to look after the contents of the cellar and pantry, and to set things to rights in general. "Bridget, how came this jelly unsealed and this fruit- jar uncovered?" she asked, lifting the articles from the pantry shelf. "And sure, mum, as I did not do it meself, I can't tell ye," answered the servant, in a dogged tone. "Why, Bridget, how comes this? One of-my best knives broken and hidden behind the flower-barrel. And see here, and here," she continued, holding up alternately broken spoons, forks and goblets. "And faith, mum, and Iniver did it, upon the soul of me," ejaculated the girl, holding up her hands as if in utter amazement. "And who can be the baste that iver did such a cowardly dade?"   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       279 "Why, Bridget, who but yourself has had perfect con- trol of all these things?" asked Mrs. Howard, in a per- plexed manner. "I'll declare by the Virgin, Mrs. Howard, that it was not meself that did it at all, at all," continued the girl, persistingly, and with the same straightforward, unflinch- ing look. "And, by the way," she continued, as if a new thought had just crossed her brain, " and its jist I that's seen Tom in here of late when he did not know that I was around at all." "Bridget, for goodness sake, don't add any more false- hoods to your catalogue of guilt, nor try to clear yourself by seeking to implicate some one else," retorted her mis- tress, in an angry tone. "'You know as well as Ido that Tom has had nothing to do with this, and that it is your own work. I would be ashamed to tell such unqualified falsehoods to get out of anything." Ashamed! She might as well have tried to shame the stove-pipe as to bring a blush to that brazen face, and she well knew it; but her patience was utterly exhausted, and what was she to do. She turned away from that scene of waste and dis- order, in a state of utter perplexity and with a sinking heart. She feared lest she had gotten the girl's "Irish up," if it could be said to be up more at one time than another, for that blank, dauntless countenance ever seemed to tell of some heartless villainy within; but es- pecially did she dread the consequences now in her hus- band's absence.

"And will the masther come home to-night?" she asked, as Rena thought, in a suspicious tone, but not in the least daunted by the reproof which she had so openly received, after a brief interval of silence. "I don't know," was answered, with a slighter tremor of the voice than before; but Rena did not look up, and went on more hurriedly in her arduous task of "straightening up " and rearranging here and there. "But I rather ex- pect he will." Her conscience gave a guily start as she uttered these words, but it was not by any means the first time that she had taken refuge under like deceptions, hoping thereby to lessen the danger which-she imagined was impending over her. And she took no shame to herself, although but a moment before she had so strongly imputed it to the ignorant housemaid for having uttered falsehood to screen herself from blame. But she looked at this as a very different case-one which the end sought, being simply preservation, justified the means. Ah! but God's injunction to " speak every man truth with his neighbor," does not so divide falsehood. It is no more than any one would do under similar circumstances, who is not walking in the power of a living faith; but it only proves what the heart by nature is, and does not justify the de- ception in the least. She had yet to learn that " the angel of the Lord encampeth around them that fear him, to deliver them," and not seek to take refuge under some   VANQUISHED LIFE.-DREAM I.    28  human subterfuge. She had yet to learn that, although her natural protector might be near in the person of her husband, "Except the Lord keep the city, the watchmen watch in vain." But this is a hard lesson to learn, and one that nature, however apt, can take no part in. It is the pure, the heav- enly principles of faith, which can only be learned in the school of Him who " made himself of no reputation;" when, in the spiri of Him, we can rejoice at being lowly and cast out, and sit in humility at His feet, realizing His undiminished power as well as His grace and goodness! And she turned, wearied in body and mind, from the work she had just completed and left the servant to enjoy her own thoughts, which were, doubtless, less gloomy than her own. Her little Bible lay upon the work-stand, and taking it up she turned the leaves with tremulous fingers, hoping to find some passage of Scripture that might be applied to herself. And yet, although they were numerous on every page of the inspired volume, she dared not appro- priate them to herself. They seemed afar off-something unreal--or something, however real it might be for others, not intended for herself. There was a beauty in the poetic languae, a sublimity in the thoughts and senti- ments, that rise so far above man's thought; but it seemed to find no responsive chord to wake the faintest melody in her heart. She leaned back wearily in her easy chair, while the inspired volume lay open before her.                   I "Oh! that I could trust in the Lord," she murmured 18    <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6632-00000142"/> 282     LINDEN AILL; OR, THE' clasping her hands ; " that I could know that I was born of God."  The setting sun again gilded the tops of the lofty trees and the evening zephyrs again fanned away the sultry breath of a hot summer's day, but again it failed. to glad- den a heart that as yet had not known the " peace of God which passeth understanding." Bridget's uncouth melodies, if such a name should be given her wild bal- lads of Erin, sounded more like fiendish triumphs than strains of music, as they fell now and then upon her ear, while she watched the children, who, tired out with their unfinished and almost uncommenced work, had thus early sought their bed, to dream, perchance, of ponies and already finished stables to protect them. She kneeled beside the bed at length and tried to commit herself into the hands of Him whose power she realized as being omnipotent; but how could she leave herself confidently in the care of one whose love she doubted? She could as easily trust herself with the servants that her weak nature so much dreaded as with a God of wrath. And thus the night wore away, as many a night had done, but brought no re t, for the ungodly find no real rest in all their vain pursuits. And even days dragged wearily on- ward in this manner. The children were again engaged in their busy ham- merings, when hastily concealing the book of books in her bosom, as if it were a shame to be thus occupied, she snatched her bonnet and sought the solitude of the quiet wood-"God's first temple." It was a favorite haunt, and one that she had often   VANQUISHE D LIFE -DRE A M.    283 sought in days gone by, to bow before Him who rules the earth and sea. She seated herself upon a mossy bank, and the little brook glided onward noiselessly beneath her feet, but she heeded it not. The birds chirped their blithe notes as they hopped from bough to bough of the lofty trees that towered so majestically above her, but they woke no happy responsive note in her lonely breast. "The little birds seem happy and contented," she mur- mured pensively as she watched a faithful mother-bird fly off with her coveted prize to administer food to her un- fledged nestlings upon the rickety old stump beyond. "It looks like this old tumble-down trunk would not afford a very desirable habitation, and yet those birds chatter gaily as if it were a perfect paradise to them.- Well, that verdant wood-bine does cover up much of its rotten de- formity, and somewhat beautifies it after all. And such is life everywhere," she continued mentally, while a deep- drawn sigh escaped her lips. "Its brightest scenes are only rendered beautiful by covering up some heart-ache ;" and taking the book from its place of concealment, she read, "I am the way, the truth and the life." " O God," she murmured, as she closed the book and raised her eyes heavenward, '" give me a clearer conception of the mercies which thine own word declares thou dost pos- sess! Give me an assurance of thy love to me, for I am miserable and undone! O Thou that inhabitests eternity, show me more clearly thls ' way,' this ' truth,' and this 'life,' and if thy mercy is for me, enable me to appreciate thy promises and enter into their real meaning!

But no ray of divine light pierced her soul, and not having a heart that could '" wait upon God," her unbe- lief was again ready to stigmatize him as a hard, unfeel- ing master, whose ears were deaf to the sinner's cry. A fluttering cry from the birds drew her eye to the old, decayed stump with its verdant covering, and she drew back with horror as she saw a trailing serpent glide noiselessly to the entrance of that which, but a moment before, was such a snug and happy little home. She peered wildly about as if serpents were ready to coil about her own person, while a cold, sickening sensation took possession of her heart. "And this is the way of all belonging to earth," she murmured almost bitterly. "The brightest spots of earth are insecure, and are liable at any moment to be marred by the serpent's trail. Why, if God is a 'God of love,' as we are told, does he permit this? Poor, little birdies! The Bible says that not a sparrow can fall to the ground without his notice; and how, if he is seeing this, could He look on, with power to prevent, and see that which makes even my sinful heart ache?" But her wayward queries found no answer, and her unbelief drove her farther and farther from the love which she thought she desired to find. It was God try- ing to reveal his love, but she would not believe it. She reallyfeared His power, but her heart as fully hated, be- cause it had no confidence in His goodness, although she did not even herself know that such was the case.   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      285 "It is all dark, sdark, DARK!" she reiterated- again and again, with clenched teeth, as she turned away from the cheerless scene to retrace her homeward footsteps. "I hoped to find that God was for me, bat in vain. Per- haps my doom is sealed, and this is but a foretaste of that which awaits me beyond." The wind which murmured through the tree-tops was the only answer thengiven to her unbelieving heart, and she moved onward through this more than Egyptian darkness of mind in which her bewildered soul was blindly groping, not knowing that the Great Physician was even then waiting to open the blind eyes and send peace to the troubled heart. "I see that you are profitably employed," remarked a friend whom God had sent to hold up before her eyes the healing balm for all our ills. "God's word is a blessed companion for our solitude." "It ought to be," smiled Rena, as he took the proffered chair; " but it seems to be better suited to others than to myself.' "Ah! but why should that be so?" he asked, pleas- antly. "The message of God's grace is sent to those who are lost; is it that you can't class yourself among that number?" "By no means, Mr. Gretchen," she answered, earnestly. "I know that by nature I am lost--I believe that part fully; but when it comes to the promises given to the sinner, I can't fully apply them to myself." "But how can that be?" he persisted. "Don't you see that whasoever will, let him partake of the water of    <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6632-00000144"/> 286     LIND ESN TZILL; O R, THE life freely? If you have not already partaken of th:.s water of life, it is because your own will refuses, and nothing else." "It all seems so dark to me," was the simple response; "hbut I wish that I could/feel that I was saved." "If I were to tell you that I met your husband in the village an hour ago, would you believe it?" he asked, earnestly. "Indeed, Mr Gretchen, if you were to say that you positively saw him I should manifest but little confidence in your word to disbelieve it, even though I might not be expecting him to-day," she replied, indifferently. "Then, if you receive the witness of men, the witness of God is far greater," he responded, in an earnest tone. "I might be mistaken, however positive I might feel; but God's word ' is forever established in heaven,' and He says that ' whosoever believeth upon the Son of God hatzh everlasting life, and shall not come into condemna- tion, but is passed from death unto life.' Do you believe on Him?" "I think so," she answered, slowly; " but I don't know whether I believe right or not." 'Ahl! 'believe righti,' he remarked, in a quizzical manner, "It does not say ' whosoever believeth right.' You either believe on him, or you do not. If you believe on Him, His word says you have everlasting life; if you do not, then you are lost " "Mr. Gretchen, I can not see it in that light," re- sponded Mrs. Howard, in a straightforward manner. "The devils believe and tremble;. and even Paul, wJ!o had   VA NQ UIStPED LIFE-DREAM.     287 been caught up to the third heavens, was fearful of being a castaway." Paul Gretchen laughed a light, winsome laugh, but seemed none disconcerted with the strong argument which she used against him. "Isn't it enough, Mrs. Howard," he continued, pleas- antly, " to make them tremble? The devils believe- not on Him as a Savior, but believe in him as a God; and knowing that He has not died to- save devils, but fallen men, that their doom is eternally fixed, is it any wonder, we say again, that they should tremble in view of it? If man were left in tlxis hopeless condition, then perhaps he might have a faith similar to that to which you refer; but, thanks to a merciful God, he is not left in this hopeless condition." "Yes, but Paul had known Him as a Savior God," she reponded, as if desirous to prove the truth of a delu- sion which an hour before she had besought God to take away. "Ah! indeed he had; and having known him as such, had everlasting life, for 'this is life everlasting that they might know Thee, the only true God and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.' When we recognize in Him a God of love, we can no longer doubt that love. Our whole mind is changed when we see in Him a Being so different from what we thought He was, and this pro- duces faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. When we see that He is for us-entirely for us-we can then trust Him, and this trust is the faith that lays hold upon eternal life, for Christ himself is our life."    <pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6632-00000145"/> 288     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE He spoke deeply, earnestly, and his eye beamed with more tltan earthly light as he sought thus faithfully to present God's truth to her benighted soul; but she un- derstood it not, or, at most, understood it only as human reasoning, and not as the truth of God. "And Paul," he went on to say, "was not afraid of losing this eternal life, 'for the gift of God is eternal life,' he himself says. He recognized himself as only I an empty vessel' waiting to be used by the Master's hand, and desired to be purged from all uncleanness that he might at any time be meet for use. Therefore, he says, 'I keep my body in su bjection, lest, after I had preached the Gospel to others, I myself should be a castaway.' He did not fear the loss of eternal life, because in the foregoing verse he says, ' we run not uncertainly.' He wished to keep the old nature in the place of death, that the Lord might not cast him away as an unclean vessel, polluted by the things of time and sense, and, therefore, unfitted for the furtherance of God's glorious purposes. Can you not see the force of this?" he asked, seeing that Rena was not disposed to answer. "I don't know; it all seems so mysterious," she re- sponded. "And then I have always been taught that that was what this passage meant." "I don't wonder at it," he answered, compassionately; "but would you, for the sake of perpetuating one long- cherished supposition, make all of Paul's writings a plain contradiction? He says, 'we kiowe that if this our earthly house were dissolved, we have a building of God., '1Knowhig that he which raised up the Lord Tesus shall   VANQUISIIED LIFE-DREAA.      289 raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you;' and many other such passages might be mentioned. Does there seem to be any uncertainty about his condi- tion here? The truth is, we want to bend Scripture so that it will fit our own experience instead of receiving it just as it stands." "I have never felt that I did," responded Rena, some- what coldly, for she felt that she had been well-nigh van- quished in this conversation, and her pride, which was usually rather sensitive, was touched. "I have ever been willing to grant to others the liberty I myself claim--the privilege of believing as I choose." "But what is the result of such liberality?" he asked, without pretending to notice the force of her remark. "What is the human mind, ungoverned by the word of God, not liable to believe? The Word tells us that God is love, and yet man, by nature, does not believe it, but regards him as 'an austere man, gathering where he has not strewn,' etc. Our own liberal views, as we are wont to teim them, if not in accordance with the word of God, are literally worth nothing." He saw that her self-will was offended, but what better could be done?  He could not say, " peace! peace!" when he saw that she hand no "peace," nor seek to heal slightly the hurt that possessed her awakened soul. He felt that the wound must be deeply probed ere the heal- ing balm could be beneficially applied, and therefore, as a true embassador of Christ, would not withold the need- ful remedy. "I see," she remarked, as if wishing to change the    <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6632-00000146"/> 290     LINVDEN A . ILL; OR, THE subject, " that we cannot see alike upon this point, and therefore it would be just as well to change the subject." "Cannot see alike!" he responded, solemnly. "MWe will have to bow to the unchanging word of God sooner or later, 'for every knee shall bow.' Is it not better to bow to it now in a day of grace than to have to bow to it in a day of judgment?"  She was too thoroughly convicted of her own sinful condition to feel any great degree of animosity in her heart, for grace was about to triumph; and as the dying man swallows the nauseous draught, not because it is sweet to the taste, but because he feels that i,' is that or death, so she received the message of God, however bit- ter to nature, realizing that without some interposing remedy eternal death awaited her. "I wish he hadn't come," pouted Phil, when the visitor had bidden them a pleasant " good evening," and was hastening back to the village that nestled in the shadow of the hills below. "I wish he'd stay away, I do. He makes you look so miserable, talking like you wasn't good, when you are a dear, good mamma." She smiled as she kissed the affectionate child, whose ideal of perfection she personified, saying, "mamma's not good; you only think so. The Bible says there is none good but one-that is God." "Yes, but you are, of course, not quite as good as God, but I know you're good. You and Papa and Seltie are all good, but Bridget's not." "Why do you think she is not good?" interposed Mrs. Howard, as the child was glibly chattering away,   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       29I "I'm sure she is very devotional with her forms and ceremonial religion." -' Goodness, aren't she though!' shouted Phil, laughing gaily. "'Why, only this morning she was kneeling on the cellar steps, when you sent her down for cream, counting over her beads and muttering over some hea- thenish mess about ' Holy Mary;' but my! didn't she jump when she found she was caught." "If she thinks it is right, she should not be ashamed of it," remarked the mother, checking the merriment of the boy. "People should never be ashamed of trying to do right." "I know that, and you're not ashamed because you know you're right; but then she's not, or she would be- lieve as you do," responded the child, -fully persuaded that views adopted by his mother must be the views, and that such alone were worth believing. "Oh! its all bosh, I know," he continued, " for she'll say her long-winded prayers and then tell a fib, and don't care a bit for it." "Why, Phil, how you talk," whispered the mother. "What do you know ab6ut her telling falsehoods?" "Haven't I heard her, though?" he answered earnestly.

And away he bounded to attend to his ac- customed duties. "Bring the lamp in, Bridget," said Mrs. Howard, when the tea-things had been cleared away. "I'm so nervous and fidgety that I cannot sleep of nights, so I shall put in my time reading for a while, and see if that will help me." The deep, dark shadows of night soon enveloped the outer world, and quiet reigned within as one by one of the household succumbed to the powers of slumber. Rena lay with loose, flowing wrapper and unbound tresses upon a couch, beside which the little lamp burned brightly, turning page after page of different reading matters, but she could not feel interested in any of them. An interesting novel would have readily attracted her at- tention, but her superstitious nature ,as afraid of this, and now in this time of fancied peril she was determined to read no such acknowledged evil, but to be very good and do all the good she could, inwardly feeling that in consideration of such God would prove more merciful. She tried to feel sleepy, for gladly would she have lain aside the books and papers that lay scattered in such pro- fusion around her, and were only used as an antidote against fear; but slumber seemed very coquettish, and all her wooing could not win its soothing influence. "Perhaps I could get to sleep sooner if it were dark," she mentally remarked. "I will read a few verses and leave all with God, for I can't do anything to better my condi- tion, and shall try no more." She opened the book and read, "He that believeth   PANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      293 not the record which God hath given of his Son is making God a liar, because he hath not believed the record which God hath given." "Is it possible?" she murmured, reading it a second, and even third time. "Yes, I am! I see it all now!" she continued, closing the book, with her hand for a mark, and leaning back upon the snowy pillow. A new light illumined her eye and a new peace filled her whole heart-a peace which the world knew nothing of. "I have been blindly groping onward, beseeching God to assure me of salvation, and when His Word pointed out that assurance I made Him a liar-I would not be- lieve His Word! I looked at God as an austere man-- but oh! what height and depth! Such love is beyond human comprehension!" The sound of Bridget's unusual snoring, which an hour before would have sounded like some harbinger of evil, was destitute of terror now, as from an adjoining room it reached her ear; and, in fact, as she reviewed these things, the poor girl's waywardness seemed now more as the fruits of her own self-will and bad example than she ever before supposed, and she could not otherwise regard her but with forbearance and forgiving tenderness. For this was God's peace and not man's which she had now found. It was a peace emanating from Him who, amid all the horrors of the crucifixion, could say, "Forgive them, for they know not what they do /"She extinguished the lamp and again leaned back upon the pillows to en- joy that rest-such a rest as through all the meandering paths of life her wearied heart had never known!

It was well she had thus early learned to distrust self, and to look away from inward feelings for peace and joy, for these inward looks reveal so mu-ich of selfishness and sin that they can never bring else but doubt and darkness to the penitent soul. The ground of assurance she knew was not in the Spirit's work within her heart, however blessed the peace, as the result of that work might be, but in trusting faith looking away to Him who had an- swered every claim of justice, had fully met the claims of God in suffering in her stead--"the just for the un- just." And it is this knowledge that, in every instance, must give the sinner peace. If his trust is in the joy that his heart has at some period felt, the change that he has seen in his life, then he is walking by sight and -not by fait--he is trusting in things that are seen and not in things that are unseen, and should be reminded that things that are seen are temporal, while it is those unseen which are eternal! The soul that is thus occupied with its own doubts and feelings can never " grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ." He may to some extent grow in the knowledge of his own evil heart, but this, without a knowledge of the Savior's love, can never give peace or joy.

The sun, without an intervening cloud, had risen and was already shining through the open window as Rena Howard, somewhat later than usual, awoke from a sweet, refreshing slumber, which no dark and fearful dream had broken through the preceding night. But the joy which she had feared her own rebellious heart might mar was still unclouded. 'In fact, this new life in the soul, as the new-born child, had but increased in strength with the lapse of time. Everything wore a newer, brighter garb as her heart, overflowing with its deep peace, sang in quiet joy. And this was the "beginning of days,', the beginning of that new, bright life that was to be glad and cheerful down here below, and perfected in bliss in the world to come! Even Bridget, with her blank, cold stare, noticed the absence of that ever-gloom; cloud upon her face, as she entered the breakfast room with a pleasant smile. "And is it that yer head is better?" she queried, as   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       297 Mrs. Howard seated herself at the breakfast table, where Phil and Seltie were already awaiting her. "Both head and heart are better, Bridget," she re- sponded, emphatically. "I feel to-day as if old things had forever passed away' and there was nothing left to hinder perfect joy." The girl stared blankly, and no wonder. A hereto- fore silent chord, that of rejoicing, had been touched in that weary heart, and no wonder that the strains called forth amazement in those who had witnessed only the most desponding notes. "What do you mean, mamma?" asked Phil, with a comical look. "I did not know that your heart ached." "Didn't you?" she responded. "Well, it doesn't now; God has cured it all, and mamma feels so thank- ful for it." "Then I'm glad," replied the little fellow, as he munched away on his bread and butter. "I don't un- derstand how God could cure you. But I guess it's be- cause he made you sleep so nicely, and I'm awful glad of it." A happy, cheerful countenance, and especially when possessed by the mother, has a wonderful influence upon the whole home circle, which as the days passed by was more and more clearly seen. Not that she had never in passed years had spasmodic seasons of cheerfulness, but they did not lift the cloud from off her heart, and were as far short of real cheerfulness as the theatrical perform- ance, however interesting, falls short of real life. "Papa's come! papa's come!" shouted little Seltie. 19    <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6632-00000150"/> 298     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE And Rena raised her eyes from the humble work be fore her just as his horse dashed up to the stile. The simple, although very necessary, ,emplo3ment which oc- cupied her time seemed to have lost all appearance of diudgery, as the snatches of sweet old melodies which ever now and then fell from her lips would clearly indi- cate. Even the children's busy prattle and numerous questions, some of them perhaps unanswerable, no longer worried her; and the sound of their childish voices gave- a new thrill to the gush of music lhat was welling up into her own happy heart. This new peace- had forever stilled the troubled waters of her soul and illumined the dark cloud which had loomed threateningly above her, and a gleam of the same light had gladdened the pale face, which although the little ones could not understand, they could see and rejoice in, even while there was greater joy among the angels of God. "Come, help pick up these things; quick time now," she remarked, gathering up the alphabet blocks and nu- merous toys that were scattered profusely about the room. "Yes, put them in the box here, ma," responded Phil, as he grabbed them up by the handful. "'Papa will think we always have a dirty floor, and 'll get it all tidy be- fore he comes in." The last thing had been snugly tucked away in its ac- customed place as Philip entered the room, accompanied by Seltie, who had left everything to meet his father, not knowing that a room looked any neater one way than it did in another.

"Quite well," she answered, "and glad to see you come, although I was not expecting you to-day." "When will our pony come, papa?" asked Seltie, climbing upon his father's knee; and then, without wait- ing for an answer, continued, "Phil and I have been making a stable for him out by the pig-pen." "V-hat! do you call that pile of boards out there a stable?" asked their father. "Why, its not large enough for your dog, Tasso, to crawl into. How do you expect to squeeze a pony into it?"    " "But its not finished yet," interposed Phil, wishing to hold up for his own workmanship. "It will be bigger when we get it finished." "When you get the material scattered over a larger space of ground, you mean," was the laughing rejoinder. "Well, I'll not condemn your skill until I see it fairly tested, if you don't split up too many boards and with them destroy too many nails." "We won't," shouted both in a breath. "But come, for we must go to work or we will not have it done when the pony comes." And they two bounded lightly away to accomplish their undertaking. They were thus early living in the 'future. It was but another instance of the buoyant hopes which go forth even in life's early morning; but how often disappointment succeeds disappointment, even from the time the infant hand first tries to grasp the ray of sun-    <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6632-00000151"/> 300     LINDEN HILL; OR, 7HE light and finds only the shadow enclosed in his tiny fin- gers! It would be well if these frequent disappoint- ments would only drive the disappointed to the reality of God's word, and the wondrous love as specified therein; but it seldom does. There is ever an eminence beyond, looking so fair and inviting, and he wishes to hasten over the rugged paths that intervene, to reach the beautiful hills beyond! Even so now were these little ones looking forward for enjoyment, forgetful of the many shady haunts and lovely retreats upon this, their own green hill-that home so fraught with nature's loveliness, but were awaiting the advent of some new toy-something for a change--with which to occupy their changing minds. "Have you been lonely?" asked Philip, gently smooth- ing her tresses with his broad, bronzed hand. "I came earlier than I really ought to have done on that account, but I'm glad to see you looking so cheerful." I am only too glad to have you come," she answered, nestling her hand in his. "But I am not lonely now. I seem to find companionship in everything." "I am very glad to hear it," he responded, with a ra- diant look; " but what can have wrought such a wonder- ful change? Have you concluded that those silly fears were mere idle fancies?" ( No, Philip," she answered promptly, although a deep, a holy joy filled her heart and lighted up her eye as she said it. "I shall never believe that those were idle fears, and that it was not in the heart of Tom (who, by-the- way, has left since you went away) to perpetrate some   VA NQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      301 crime. But, by the grace of God, I am now standing where I have ceased to fear what man can do." "I don't understand you," answered Philip, with a puzzled expression. "You can't surely consider yourself more invincible than heretofore." "By no means; but my slavish chains have been broken by Him who came to deliver them who, through fear of death, were all their lives subject to bondage." He made no reply to this, for of course he could not be expected to understand spiritual things with a carnal mind. "Oh! Philip," she continued, after a moment's silence, "you have no idea what blessed peace I have found in these truths. Old things seem to have all passed away, and all is new, bright and happy I! I think that I could not have been a Christian before, and that it is only three days ago that I was born of God." "What makes you think so, Rena?" he asked. "If any one is, I don't see why you were not as well." "Because, Philip, if I was a Christian, why was I groping through such utter darkness? Why was I so oppressed with fears and doubts, and so reluctant to meet God, if he was my Father? But I see it all clearly now," she continued, joyfully, and her face was radiant with the happiness her life possessed. "I was simply doubting the love and goodness of God. And O, Philip, you have no conception of the agony I have endured through these miserable fears. I almost look back upon them now with horror! But, thanks be to -God, they are all over, for I know that God's love will    <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6632-00000152"/> 302     LINDEN HiILL; OR, THE never forsake me, and His angels will encamp around me, so I fear neither man nor demon more!" A look of incredulity crossed his face, for never before during all her insane frenzy had he so feared a dethrone- ment of her reason. "Have you been quite well since I went away?" he again asked, tenderly pressing her soft cheek against his own. "I think so," she responded lightly. "At least, if I have not, my ailments have appeared so trivial since the heavier load has been lifted from my heart that I have not noticed them." "Poor, tired child!" he murmured gently. "You have been left alone too much, and I feel guilty when I think of it." "Don't pity me now, Philip," she answered, pleas- antly. "' Pity, and action born of pity, in the years gone by would have been only too thankfully received, but now I feel that I am an object of envy more than one of piiy. But I do not blame you now," she went on to say. "Although God knows how bitterly I have done so, for this discipline had to be used to humble me in the dust, that He might lift me up into the light of his own blessed presence. The hand that I once thought was using the tyrant's rod I see now was only dealing in love." ' And sure, mum, and shall I ring for tea," asked Bridget, poking her head in at the door with a face all aglow with heat as well as health. "Certainly, Bridget," answered Mrs. Howard., "But   VA NQUISHED .LIFE-DREAM.     303 I believe we are all here," and shaking out the garment which her busy fingers had just completed, said, "Come, Philip, and see what a treat we have reserved for you. See these nice raspberries! We would not gather them until you came, but they are only the better by being ,left and fully ripened." "They are indeed delicious," answered Mr. Howard, tasting the inviting-dish. "Mammna and my boys are very kind to always remember ma so cleverly." "But Seltie wanted to eat them bad enough," put in little Phil, as he drew his chair closer to the table. "He said it made his mouth water for berries every time he looked at them, and that it would not make any differ- ence with you if you did not know we had them." "Is that so, Seltie?" asked the father, as he turned toward- the blushing child who was seated near his mother on the other side of the table. "Didn't you want to keep some for papa?" "We did keep some for 'pa," responded the child, but his lip quivered and a tear was visible in his big, blue eye. ' But you wanted to eat them all," persisted the brother, " and mammna would not let you." "O! fie, Phil, don't talk so to your little brother," said- the mother, chidingly. "Seltie wanted papa to have some as well as we did, but as these are the first the briars have borne, the temptation to eat them as fast as they ripened was very hard to resist. Don't cry, Seltie," she continued, wiping the tears from his blushing little face; " he's mamma's own precious jewel."    <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6632-00000153"/> 304     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "And papa's, too," responded Mr. Howard. "He needs considerable polishing yet before the rough is all' taken away, but mamma will attend to that, I'm sure." The child's face was again lifted up and the traces of shame gradually wore away, while every face was radiant with happiness, although to but one heart had God's peace been sent. It is thus that a knowledge of God's love can smooth every rugged path, and shed a subduing influence even over those with whom it comes in con- tact, for even Bridget's face wore a more softened ex- pression and her voice grated less harshly upon the ear, as with a light step and humming some quaint old Irish melody, she whiled away the evening toils. "What was the reason Tom left so unceremoniously, Bridget?" asked Mr. Howard. "Have you been so heartless as to refuse to marry him?" "Faith and I can't tell ye why he left, indade," she responded, trying to look blushingly and thereby prove that the supposition was really true. "He's wonder- fully asy miffed, to be sure, or he'd niver been so quick to lave at all." "I believe he intimated that one of his children were sick," remarked Mrs. Howard, laughing. "And that is the best of the joke on Bridget, as she has been con- sidering him quite a beaux, and did not know that he was a widower with two dirty-faced urchins, until he told her just before he left." "That's a good one, Bridget, and you must excuse us for laughing at you; but do not get out of heart, for he will find out when he gets back to those cry-babies,   VA NQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      305 if he has such, that he needs a wife to care for them more than he thought." "Faith, and little do I care for him, or his cry-babies ather," she replied; " and he knows that I would niver marry him is what's the matter." ," I expected it was some lover's quarrel gotten up between you," he continued, " and I don't think that you have served me right, jilting him, for Tom was a good fellow to see after things. I'm afraid I shall not readily find another who will be capable of filling his place." A pleased grin was visible upon the girl's countenance as she left the room, for it was rather gratifying for her to think that although she had tried and failed to secure Tom's affections, persons suspected her of having gained his love, and then as lightly thrown it away. Such is the vanity of human nature! If the disappointed heart does feel a smart it does not want the world to know it. It does not mind the smart half so much as the reproach it brings, and then endeavors to convince others that it had sufficient attraction to gain the coveted prize, but willfully rejects it. There is no sphere of life exempt from this desire to shine in a borrowed light--to parade external attractions which are not really possessed. It is the same from the nobleman to the serf-being only a characteristic of human nature, and proving the truth of the words, that " of one blood are all nations made." "Do listen to Bridget's singing," whispered Philip, as they sat in the doorway after the evening meal was past. "Such notes are enough to shame the owls into silence."    <pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6632-00000154"/> 306     LINDEN HILL; OR, TlHE "If it only makes melody in her heart, then we ought to bear it patiently," responded Rena, as she pressed a "good-night kiss " upon the lips of her children as they sought their welcome couch. The wearied little ones were soon lost in the myste- rious mazes of slumber-that refreshing sleep so peculiar to childhood-and the mother, with a lingering look of tenderness, turned away. "What a lovely evening," remarked Philip, as she seated herself near him. "This soft moonlight seems almost enough to fill one with inspiration. I should think that you could write a poem such an evening as this." "Me?" she queried, simply. "O, I have nearly given that up of late; my thoughts were all so gloomy that I could not touch a single chord of imagination without sending forth a wail. But they are all of the past. But if inspiration comes through moonlight, why are you not inspired, too?" "u Because I deal in more matter-of-fact material. My mind wants something real, and not imaginary. I would starve on the light food that feeds and sustains your nature." "It is well that our natures are thus different," she re- marked, looking far away through the stilly moonlight on the outspread scene of loveliness beyond. "If we both dealt in visionary matters perhaps we would even- tually learn what literal starvation meant." "I don't doubt it," was the rejoinder; " but then I like   VANQUISHED LIFE DREAM.       307 for you to have these ranges of' fancy when you are happy in them, as you seem to enjoy them so much." "These flights of fancy'are sweet, inexpressibly sweet," she murmured, thoughtfully; " but when not under the influence of God's truth, I think, as a general thing, they produce unhappiness. Of course, my own experience amounts to nothing, for, with my narrow range of thought, I could not be expected to know what greater minds would be capable of understanding. But look at earth's great ones, whose beautiful sentiments have charmed the-world and stirred up envy in view of their renown in many a heart, and see what sad, what gloomy shadows often envelope them. No, Philip; rest, perfect joy is not found in earthly dreams. If God's Word did not prove this, observation and my own experience would attest the truth of it." "Rena, I aln inclined to think that you are somewhat fanatical of late," laughed, Philip; "you seem to enjoy the things of this world more than most persons who do not profess to see such emptiness in it all. How can you be on such extremes at the same time?" I do enjoy them, Philip, really enjoy them, too, because "' I have found a branch of healing Near every bitter spring.' "Through all our past years, when wearied, dispirited from any cause, an assurance of your sympathy always seemed to lighten the burden and make things easier to bear; then think how a knowledge of the sympathy of Jesus must sweeten the bitters of life down here and fill    <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6632-00000155"/> 308     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE my heart with thankfulness, realizing, as I do, that ' every good and every perfect gift cometh down from the Father of Lights, in whom there is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.'" "(O fie! Rena; you are getting to be almost as bad as old Murphy in talking religion," ejaculated Philip, im- patiently. "People can be religious without forever boring some one else with a preamble of sentimental stuff. I was so disgusted with Murphy the other evening here that I left the house on purpose to avoid him." "I know it," she answered, quietly; " but it is ' out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaketh; and when the lips never speak of Jesus, it is conclusive evidence that He holds a small place in the heart." "O, I think lots of it is put on just to show off. I don't have any too much confidence in his goodness, any how; and somehow I naturally detest the very sight of him." "I expect you have as much confidence in his good- ness as he has, Philip, for I am sure he is every ready to acknowledge that he is nothing in himself but a poor, degraded sinner, and seeing his low, undone condition by nature, how can he help speaking of the wondrous, con- descending love that stooped to lift him from his low estate?" '"It's a pity he did not lift him clear out of respectable society, where he makes himself a perfect nuisance," was the cold response, for Philip Howard hated the light that had been brought so near himself, lest his own deeds should be reproved.   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       309 "He will be lifted out of respectable society soon," she responded, calmly. "When the mansions above are prepared He will come and take all His own to be with Himself, for He has said that He would come in a ' little while,' and that they who suffer in rejection with Him here below shall reign with Him above! But I know that these things are really irksome to you, Philip, for you do not enter into the reality of them, and, therefore, I can't wonder at your not wanting to hear it." "I don't doubt the reality of what you profess, dear," he responded, tenderly. "I fully believe you are sincere in what you say, and I love you only the more for it; but, then, I see no use in such extravagance." "It would seem to me an unfaithful one who would never espouse the cause of an absent loved one, and especially when he was cast out and dishonored by the world," she answered. "But there's plenty just as good as Murphy or Paul Gretchen who don't do it," was responded; "people who are Christians,' and yet are not forever poking these things under your nose." "And what do they talk about?" she queried. "Why, just what any sensible person should talk about -the markets, politics, and general news of the day." "Of course, then, these things occupy their minds, and they are speaking from the 'abundance of their hearts.' " "Rena, you must have lost all the reason you ever possessed," he replied, almost angrily.

These things of the world may all be used profitably, and be beneficial to the Chris- tian as stepping stones to a better inheritance, but his heart is not to be occupied with them. Suppose, for ex- ample, that you were taking a trip to Europe. You would cross over on her ships, use her railways and canals, and even her carriages and hotels, to help you on and promote your comfort, but would your heart be in them? Would you in any degree have your feelings and interests identified with these internal or external im- provements as you would with those of your own country? The Christian, whose country is a heavenly one, is to labor with his hands or head, if necessary, to follow up some avocation in life, or, as the apostle terms it, to ' abide in the same calling wherein he is called with God." But he is to hold it all with a loose hand, con- sider it as a secondary matter, ard have his thoughts and affections placed on things above." "Well, if he has nothing in common with the world, I think he had better go out of it, and the sooner the better. "But he can't go until God takes him," continued Rena, earnestly. "If he is true to the Savior, the cry of his heart will most assuredly be ' come, Lord Jesuts, come quickly.' But he must wait, and should be willing to wait God's time; and meanwhile to shine as a light in this dark world, and to ' owe no man anything,' but to love one another." ,6 Do you pretend to say that any one is that perfect?"

"I am not saying what any one is, but what every Christian ought to be. Don't judge of the truth by what poor Murphy is, or what you see me to be. We are all weak, fallible creatures, and if we let go the hand of the Lord, are liable to fall at any moment. There has never been but One who in perfection walked this world below, who has not been drawn aside by the seductions of the world, and that was the Lord- Jesus Christ himself. We know that in man there is no perfection-that is in his walk; and Murphy may fall, and I and others, but that does not prove God's truth untrue, or license us to walk in the paths of evil. It is only when we forsake Him, and are taken up with the things around us, that we are liable to fall. It is true that it is far less excus- / able when one who thus sees his separation from those things is drawn away and falls through manifold tempta- tions. It were better never to profess to leave the realms of Egypt than to go but a 'little way" and then return to its idolatries. The blood of the Lamb may have been applied, and the judgments impending over the land averted, while the redeemed ones still feed upon her leeks and onions instead of separating themselves by a ' three day's journey' from the land of their former bond- age, and there in the wilderness, so destitute of earthly pleasure,' hold a feast unto the Lord.'" "But remember, Philip," she continued, after a mo- ment's silence, seeing that he was not disposed to make any reply, "man-the Christian I mean-has been re-    <pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6632-00000157"/> 312     LIINDEN HILL; OR, THE deemed from the thraldom of Satan's Egypt that he might hold this feast unto the Lord, realizing his complete and eternal separation therefrom! That he might spirit- ually feast upon the Lamb who was tried by the fires of God's wrath, even with the bitter herbs of self-abhorrence -not literally, but in spirit separated from all around." "Come, come, child!" interrupted Philip, " your talk sounds so wild and unreal that I don't like to hear it. One would think you had been fitting yourself in a di- vinity school to go forth and revolutionize the world." "No; I have no desire to go," she answered in a somewwhat subdued tone of voice. I know I could not do that, and besides, this cozy, little nook at home is my world, and I have learned to be perfectly content within its limits. But, Philip, it was a bitter trial to give up my long-treasured life-dream of being something in the world! It was the dearest hope I had on earth, and I did so earnestly long to be somebody-something that the world would know and honor; but by God's grace that dream has been vanquished, and I have become the victor." "And you are now content to be loved and honored in this little world of domestic bliss," he murmured, kiss- ing the cheek that rested against his broad, manly bosom. "And rest assured that it is not mere outward homage that is shown you by the subjects of this little dominion, but the devotion of true and loyal hearts!" "I believe it," she responded. "And oh! how infi- nitely greater the happiness it brings than all the empty adulation that the world could ever offer. I would not exchange it for a kingdom. God has, indeed, verified   VANQUISHTED LIFE-DREAM.     33 His word, for He says if we give up anything in this, world for Christ's sake, we shall receive an hundredfold even here and in the world to come-' life everlasting.'"

Philip Howard strode the room with an impatient step and clouded brow. i, What is the matter with you, Philip?" asked Rena, as she looked up from the stocking she was darning, to notice his angry countenance, as with cross words he drove little Phil from his presence, simply because the child wanted some improvement made in his ox-yoke, which was almost a childish toy, that he used for train- ing up his calves properly. "O0, I don't know myself," he answered roughly. , Everything goes wrorg just ^ hen I most want it to be right.

It's enough to make a saint get out of humor." "I would not worry about it," she responded. - "It will all work out right eventually, I'm sure." "And what reason have you for supposing that it will all be right?" he asked roughly. "I shall be bound to lose considerable money through their abominable neg- ligence, and I don't see that that can work out any thing very acceptable." "' Very likely not acceptable," was the quiet rejoinder, "' but then it will doubtless be for the best in the end. If everything went on smoothly and prosperously there would be no limit to man's ambition. I have not the slightest doubt that God overrules even these seemingly trivial things," "I don't believe any such nonsense. I believe man carves out his own fortune. I hate all such sickly senti- mentalism." "As what?" asked Rena, laughingly. "O, as Paul Gretchen preaches, and asyou sometimes talk," he answered. "And of all men living, he is one of the most disagreeable." "I don't see why you think so, Philip," she responded. "He is refined by nature and cultivated, and can make himself very interesting in conversation." "Yes, and if you only stop to talk to him ten minutes, he will begin to preach to you," he continued, with a kindling eye and more wrathful tone.

"I never thought he was very intrusive." "I don't know that he is usually," he answered; "but this morning I did not want to be talked to any how, and first I met old Silas Murphy, who had to stop and try to be very friendly. But I soon bluffed him off and left him to the solitude of his own sweet thoughts. And then here came Paul Gretchen, who, when he saw that I was all out of tune, began to tell me to take things quietly and not to worry myself about them, for whether I made or lost, these things of earth were soon to pass away." "Well, isn't that the truth?" she asked. "I can't see any great crime in that." "It may all be very true, but we all would like to grab a good supply of them while they last. And then he went on to tell me that the record of man from Adam down was, that he 'lived' and did this or that, sometimes even hundreds of years, but at last it had to be said ' and he died,' and that it was equally true now, with much shorter space of time allotted here. He rmight plant and build, he might hoard up this, or seek to gather that, but the end of it all was death. And then he asked me if I did not know it; just as if I had ever disputed it, and had not known it all along as well as he did." "Really, knowing a thing, and not disputing it, are   VA NQUISHED LZIE-DREAM.      3 1 very different things, Philip," remarked Mrs. Howard. "You may never have disputed the existence of the Arctic Ocean, but could you say' from your heart that you knew it was there? You have never disputed the fact that it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment; but if it had entered your soul as a literal reality-something that your own conscience knew to be true, it would have left a visible impression upon your life. Mr. Gretchen only intended to awaken your soul from its death slumbers, to a realization of this im- portant fact." "If this is a sleep, then I've not got my sleep out yet," he answered lightly; ," and, besides, let him go to some one who wants to hear it." "And who would that be, Philip?" she asked earn- estly. "The servants in the parable were sent into the highways and hedges to call in guests to the feast, but they all, not a part, began to make excuses. So where would the Lord's servants go to find persons willing to listen to the go spel invitation?" "My stars! Rena; don't thousands hear it every Sun- day?" he asked in a querulous tone. "Philip, how many of these, even supposing that it is always the gospel preached, and not something to please man's fancy, really hear the word?

", Well, I'm willing for them to talk in the pulpit, and then if I don't like it, I need not listen to it, but this making it a personal matter-I can't, nor I won't stand it." "No doubt the woman of Samaria at Jacob's well did not like for Christ to present the truth in such a per- sonal manner," she responded; and especially when the truth made manifest her own evil course of life. But the Savior was too merciful to withold the needful rem- edy, and cover up the sins of her corrupt heart; and the servant is called to walk in the same path, manifesting the same spirit as his Master, knowing at the same time that if He was persecuted, they will be also." "Well, I think there is a time for all things, and I am not going to be driven; that's sure." !"The guests in the parable, even after they saw them- selves as 'lame, halt, and blind.' had to be compelled to come in. Such is our dislike of these things, that were it not for God's grace drawing us we would never come, even after we saw our need." "Well, do you for a moment suppose that Silas Mur- phy's talk would make me become interested in these things sooner than if he would let me alone?" he asked. "The old ignoramus, he acts like I haC been brought up in a heathen land, and he had been sent to enlighten me. I felt the other evening just like trying the virtue of sole- leather upon him." "No doubt the Pharisees at an earlier day considered   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAIM.      319 it a humiliating thing to be instructed by the fishermen that followed the Savior; but God uses whom He will, not whom the world approves. But Philip, he simply told you that you did not understand spiritual things, and you know the Bible says that " the natural mind un- derstandeth not the things of the spirit, neither can he know them, for they are spiritually discerned." "Then let him keep his mouth shut," was the response, as Philip Howard kicked the footstool from before him, not knowing how else to manifest his displeasure. As is recorded of the Gadarenes, when the devils had been cast out of the man who'lived among the tombs, and they besought the Savior to " depart out of their coasts," even so was his case now. The power and light of God's truth had been brought right to his soul, but his heart rebelled at its presence, and only wished it to depart. But God's Spirit had taken hold of his heart, and as the darkest hour is just before the day-dawn, even so was Satan's greatest power over him displayed just before the light of eternal truth illumined his soul. "I will admit," continued Rena, " that he displayed more zeal than knowledge. Thlere is no use to keep forever thrusting these things in the way, or multiplying words with one whose heart is unexercised before God. If a Christian is really walking in communion with the Lord, he will never run unsent.

I don't care what beauty of senti- ment may adorn the words of man's mouth-with what eloquence they may be spoken, if those words are not dictated by the Spirit of God they will fall powerless up- on the ear! And this is the secret of so little good being accomplished by the ministry at the present day. There is too much human wisdom spoken, something that will entrance crowds by its oratorical eloquence, by it's beau- tiful and sublime poetic sentiment, that will thrill the soul with its lofty measures; but this is but the words of man's wisdom, and not the simplicity of the Cross of Christ. And you will invariably see that the nearer the minister stands upon the platform occupied by Paul, when he 'came not with excellency of speech of man's wisdom,' but was determined to know nothing but the simplicity of the cross of Christ, the more despicable he will become." "And not any wonder," responded Mr. Howard im- patiently. "This is an age of progress, and you don't ex- pect ministers to occupy the same slip-shod position that they held in the time of Paul and Peter?" "And why not?" she asked. "I know that the world has tried to revise and improve almost everything, and even the plan of salvation has been tried to be polished off with a few fashionable touches, that it might appear in an improved light, but with all this effort it remained unchangeably the same."   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      32  "And do you suppose with the advancement of intelli- gence and refinement, that people are to move along in the same old grooves, and not keep up with the age as the world advances?" "Not in worldly things, I don't by any means," she answered. "I think the idea preposterous, if the man of abundant means was to think because his father or grandfather lived- in a log-cabin and reaped his grain with a sickle, that he must do the same. But these are worldly improvements, and for worldly advancements, and all very good in their place, but God's precepts are heavenly, and therefore uncllanging. And this same un- changing word has said that all superfluity of men's words is to be ignored, lest the cross of Christ should become of none effect. Are we to deny it?" "It's all bosh! nonsense!" he responded in a disgust- ed manner.  "I don't know what in the wide world possesses you. Ever since you came in possession of this boasted wisdom which you speak of, you seem to have given up all of your preconceived notions about educa- tion and intelligence." "It is not that I value these less," she answered earn- estly; "but I value Christ more. God forbid that I should ever -undervalue one of His gifts, which intelli- gence surely is. But it was given that with it men might honor and glorify him; but when used in rebellion against Him it proves only a curse!" ' Paul Gretchen has returned," he remarked, after a short silence, his mind still engrossed with the one hate- ful theme, and forgetting that he had spoken of meeting    <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6632-00000162"/> 322     LIND E N HILL; O R, THE him before. "I met him on the street yesterday, and tried to pass without speaking to him, but could not do it." "You spoke of meeting him this morning, I believe, she answered; but will he call and see us out on the hill soon?" she asked earnestly. "I'm sure I can't tell you," he answered. "I did not take the trouble to invite him." c, Why, Philip, how rude you must have seemed," she remarked, with a grieved expression. "I don't care, I can't bear his presence," he respond- ed. "But then it did not offend him, for I believe he is proof against that; at least I've tried it frequently with- out success. This morning, when I was so out of sorts, and he was talking to me, I told him that I knew that I ought to attend to religious duties more than I did, but that I believed I was about as safe as some who boasted so loudly about their security." "How could you talk so to one who had no object in view but your own good, Philip?" she asked feelingly. '"Just because I meant it," was the rude response. "And I have an- idea that many of those long-faced pharisaic saints will find out that they are no better off than myself when they reach the gate of heaven!" "Don't say pfharisaic; for there is no one who sees his position as Paul Gretchen does that has not been con- vinced that they were no better by nature than the very worst long ago. You will never see pharisaic pride in any one who is willing to acknowledge that he is nothing in himself but evil, nor hear him say,' I thank God that I am   vANQ UISHED IFE-DREAM.      323 not as others, extortioners, unjust, &amp;c.,' for he well knows that by nature he is precisely such. He sees too clearly where and what he was and is, and that it is redeeming grace alone that has lifted him to the place he now oc- cupies, to boast or try to parade his own merits. IThat such, even after seeing their position, may fall and be drawn into worldliness, is too true, for man is the same everywhere, and when he forsakes God will surely run into evil. But I am sorry that you talked to Mr. Gretchen in that manner; yet he has imbibed too much of the Master's spirit to retain any bitterness against you, but will readily forgive, knowing that you ' know not what you do.'" "He can forgive or not, just as he pleases," he replied indifferently; but I don't think it offended him in the least, for he went right on to say, that he did not ask me to attend to religious duties-that that would do no good --that he only asked me the question God asked Adam after he fell, ' Where art thou . ' I told him if I was lost it was my own look-out, and that I was sure of having plenty of company; and for a moment I thought he was offended, but his face socn cleared again and he went on to illustrate his point. 'I once had occasion to converse with a criminal, who, condemned to die, was really awaiting his execution,' he went on to say. ' He too had tried to find something to rest upon in the per- formance of these religious duties, but in vain.' I told him, 'you are condemned already,' your condemnation is behind you, and the gallows is before you! Your doom is settled-even fully known to you here. It is not that 4    <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6632-00000163"/> 324     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE you have actually expiated that euilt upon the scaffold, but you know your doom, and unless pardon could be granted, you must meet yourjftte! This, then, is the sin- ner's condition here exactly. You dor't need to do this or that, and hope for safety at death, and there to learn your doom. The sinner is ' condemned already' for disbe- lieving God's testimony, and rejecting the only begotten Son of God when sent into the world to save him, and death, eternal death, is before him! It is his inevitable doom, unless pardon intervenes! What good would it have done for that condemned criminal to mend his ways or be sorry for his crime? Would it have blotted out the crime for which he was to suffer, or averted the stroke of justice? By no means; and even so the sin- ner is unable to give aught toward meeting the demands of eternal justice! But there has been One who came and bore the penalty of the law in the sinner's stead. Every claim has been met, and the sinner, unless he still continues to reject the substitute, is free! The same truth is equally applicable to you and me, he remarked, for we are all by nature carnal, ' sold under sin.' I, of course, acknowledged the truth of his theory, and to be honest, must say that there was good logic in his reason- ing; but then I didn't want to be talked to in such a personal manner, and I suppose he understood it, for he bade me a hasty good-day, and turned away." Mrs. Howard leaned her head wearily upon her hand as she listened to her husband's rehearsal, and her heart reite- rated the words, "The servant is not- greater than his Lord." Never did that compassionate One vouchsafe   VYANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      325 $ His presence more fully nor enable her to lean more en- tirely upon Himself than now, when the dearest object of this world seemed so embittered against the truths of Him who was more than friend or brother. And in after years she learned that persecution is the best safe guard the Christian who would walk in separation from the evils around can possibly have. It drives him away from the deceitful shoals-of this world s joys and pleas- ures, and enables him to cling the more closely to the unfailing Rock of eternal deliverance! It is a blessed privilege to bear this persecution, and yet we are prone to shrink from stlch a cross! Philip noticed her bowed head and quivering lip, and a pang of guilty self-reproach touched his heart. He believed it was all an insane in- fatuation that would soon pass away, or else the begin- ning of one that was more horrible than death. Had Rena entered the combat with anger, as in former years, or with her own reasoning faculties, in short, with any other weapon than the word of God, he could have borne it. But this simple reliance upon God's word was incomprehensible, and the more he sought to understand it, the more puzzled he became, and the more he won- dered whether it was some new faculty bestowed upon his wife or only the feverish fancies of insanity. "It is out of no disrespect to you, darling, that I talk this way," he continued tenderly, as he took the pale hand that trembled in his own. "It was for your sake alone that I ever made the least attempt to treat him with civility, for I knew that you liked him, although I was not able to understand what it was for."    <pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6632-00000164"/> 326     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "I know you -can't," she answered hastily, brushing away a tear. "And it does not offend me, for I know that you will understand it all some day. I leave it all with Him." "But how do you know so much?" he asked, with a smile. "Do you deal in revelations, too?" "No," she responded simply; " but I know that God is faithful if I am not, and He has said that whatsoever I ask in the name of Jesus, belie,ing, I snall receive;. and I simply take Him at His word, and feel assured that I will receive it. The jailor believed the word when told that 'thou and thy house' shall be saved; and the same promise comes down to me, and with the salne power, for I am just such a sinner as himself, and Christ is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever." "Fie, what insanity, Rena!" he expostulated, for a moment forgetting his tenderness and going back into the stern, cold manner that he had manifested a short time before. "If such is the case, why don't you ask that the whole world may be saved, and believe it? That would be doing business on a more generous scale!" "Because faith/ is the gift of God," she responded, promptly; "and God will never give me faith to ask for that which His word declares will never be accomplished. ' Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life.' And if walking in communion with God, the spirit that dwells in the heart of the believer, knowing the mind of God, will ask according to His will." "Well, I'm ready to confess," he remarked, after a brief silence, "that I do not understand these things.   VANOUISrZED LIFE-DREAM.      327 But it seems if you are not somewhat insane upon these points, then I must be upon some others, for it all looks jumbled up to me. And I believe that you study too much about these things, and that it is injuring you bodily as well as mentally. Your health has been failing rapidly ever since you have been walking under the in- fluence of this delusion, or ' new light,' as you are pleased to call it." "Well, Philip, if It is a delusion, it is a happy one. Don't try to cure me of it." ^"I am almost discouraged in trying to cure you," he responded, cheerfully. "(I've tried to talk you out of it and to scold you out of it, but it all seems to no purpose. If you would scold me in return, as you used to do," he continued, in a gentle tone, "I would not mind it so, but somehow I always feel guilty afterward." "What would I scold about?" she asked lightly. "Why, just to show some spirit and stand up for your own cause." "I've got no cause to advocate," she answered, earn- estly. "Christ pleaded my cause and won it, and now I've nothing to do but enjoy His peace and be true to Him. The truths that I have brought up, and you have so de- spised, were not my truths, but God's. If they have offended any one, it is God with whom they are offended, for I have advanced nothing original,' I'm sure." "I believe that I have enjoyed a due proportion of the peace which you have experienced," he continued, for it has seemed to open up a new phase in life for mne.

"Philip, if you see a trait in my life that is worthy, re- member that it is not my own," she answered, earnestly. "The gloomy, selfish being you used to see was mne. All that you see above that now is borrowed light-reflec- tions from the person of Christ, for in myself I am still the same." "Well, you must not study about these things so much," he protested gently. "Go out into the open air more. I think it will benefit you. Come," he continued, taking her hand, "let us take a long walk and it will make you feel young again. Bridget will see after the boys; so come!" "O, I am so tired, Philip," she pleaded. "Tired of what, Lazy?" he asked, playfully. "I don't know, but I tremble so. You won't go far, will you?" "Not if you don't want to," he replied gently, for his eye was not slow to detect the deathly pallor that crept into her face at the slightest exertion. "See here is a nice place, and here is a rustic seat that Dame Nature has been kind enough to fashion upon this old tree just for you'," he whispered, seating her upon the rude settee, as they reached the outskirts of the shadowy grove. "Look, how the ripening grain bows before the gentle breeze! Isn't it beautiful?" It was, indeed, a pleasing sight, and she gazed long and earnestly upon the outspread scene. It was God's providence, in infinite wisdom, permitted them to grow,   VANQUISHED LIE-DREAM.       329 although at his command bread could be miraculously supplied to feed the multitudes. "See where the wind has blown that down; it will go to waste, Philip," she remarked, pointing to the desig- nated spot. "It will not amount to much," was the response. ( I shall not trouble myself about it." "Christ's commands were, 'gather up the fragments that nothing be lost,' and He by a single word could create food to feed five thousand. Men labor to produce it, and -then let it go to waste." "O, you are too particular," he answered, laughingly. "The birds and other things will get that. God has them all to feed." "That is true; I did not think of it. We will not grudge them their bounty," "Never before did my prospects look brighter," re- marked Philip, in an animated tone. "Fortune seems to favor me this year, and I shall call myself a lucky man.', "I'm not much of a believer in luck," interposed Rena. "'It sounds like an epithet belonging rightly to a gam- bling saloon." "Then call it fortunate or what you likej if you prefer a softer name," was the rejoinder; " but it all conveys the same meaning at last. These crops are good, and have been matured with as little expense as if I had been here overseeing it all the time. That Tom is a splendid, go-ahead fellow in such matters.

"Why, Philip, I thought you said that your disappoint- ment this morning would cause you to lose money," she queried. "It looked larger to me then than what it will really be, because I was out of humor," he responded, laugh- ing. "It will be but trifling." "Then you should not make a mountain out of a mole- hill to frighten one so," she remarked, pouting. "I have been worrying all day at having bought my new muslin dress, fearing that, with your other losses, it would tax you too severely." "Then that would be a good way to curtail expenses," was the gay rejoinder. "Whenever I think you are growing too prodigal, I'll just intimate that there are I breakers ahead.' But what is the matter?" he asked, as with increasing pallor she leaned against the tree- for support. "Has the walk tired you so?" "( It is only the headache, and then I'm so easily tired," with the ghost of a smile playing about her lips. "But I think I shall be better when I get rested." "I don't like the idea of these nervous spells; they make me feel uneasy," he continued, thoughtfully. "It makes me think that, after all, a man may plan and pro- ject, but how easily his happiness can be wrecked in a moment. I was just going to tell you what plans I had devised for next year, and what new energies I expected to throw into it, but how little we know what we will do."

"But we can enjoy the present, which is all that really belongs to us, and not look away off into the future in search of something to make us happy." "And I am sure that we do enjoy it," was the rejoin- der, as he again seated himself upon the ground near her, and watched the long shadows extending toward the haunts where the sun made its daily advent. "This increasing debility of yours troubles me considerably, but I suppose we may expect a shadow to cross every bright spot of earth, and the fear of what might happen is the only restraint upon my happiness. But, O Rena, if the reality of that which the fear of sometimes crosses my mind was to happen, what would life, be worth to me? There is not a haunt nor strain of earth that could ever wake a thrill of joy in my heart again." "Don't borrow trouble, Philip," was the gay reply. "I will be better soon, I'm sure. I somehow feel that I have a mission on earth that is not yet accomplished. It may be a very humble one, but I no longer ask a great one; and perhaps the training of our children is the work, and truly a greater or more noble work was never placed in the hands of woman." "They used to worry you, -though," said Philip; " but then you had too many cares, and I don't wonder at it." "I know they did, but myself used to worry me, too," she responded, laughing. "And H see now- that myself was the real cause of all my troubles--selfish, exacting thing that I was."    <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6632-00000167"/> 332     LINDEN HILL.; OR, 7HE "Well, what do you want?" he asked, addressing little Phil, who, finding their retreat, came bounding along the shadowy path, leaving Seltie far away in the back- ground. "O, I just come," was the childish rejoinder. "So I see, smiled Mr. Howard, " but what for?" "Nothing," he responded, innocently. "Then take nothing and go home; we are going," he remarked, as he drew the mother's hand through his arm and walked leisurely toward the house. "I wanted to come, too," whimpered Seltie, while his baby lips quivered on account of the disappointment. "Wanted to come where?" asked Philip. "To you and mamma," was the choking response. 'Well, you have come to us; what more do you want?" "Don't cry, Seltie; you can take a ride on Gipsy after tea," remarked the mother, tenderly. And away he bounded, forgetful of his little disappoint- ment in anticipation of the promised ride.   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       333 CHAPTER    XXVI. BESSIE'S VISIT.

"What do you think? Martha Hogarton has reported it around that Rena is going crazy," whispered Bessie, as her sister left the room to help Bridget in the kitchen. "Martha Hogarton always knows more than any one else," responded Philip, dryly. "I should like to know how she happens to know so much." "O, she says that these truths that Rena talks about so much are only insane fancies; and that in past years she had been broken down by hardships and too much mental labor, and that now her mind is giving way," "If I was inclined to believe that such was true, her saying it would almost set me back," he answered; "but somehow I don't feel just right about it myself; and now that I am almost compelled to go away again, I scarcely know what to do. She says that she does not care to stay now, he continued, in a low tone of voice; " but this sudden transition troubles me, and I don't feel like she ought to be left alone."    <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6632-00000168"/> 334     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "I think it would be perfectly prudent if Madge was with her," the sister answered. "And perhaps her artless ways would keep her from going back into those gloomy moods." "What do you think of this sudden new light?" he asked, as Bessie arose to lay her sleeping babe upon the lounge. She brushed the curls from her bright little face, and smoothing down the folds of her dress, answered: "I think it is simply the joy of a new conversion, and that this ecstatic joy will soon pass away, just as it does with every one else." ' But she seems so posifive about her salvation," pleaded Philip. "People generally say, II hope I will be saved,' or 'I am trying to do the best I can to gain that better country! ' Rena don't talk so; and she seems to have given up all working or trying of any sort. Know- ing, as she says, that she is saved, she seems so rejoicing in the knowledge of it, and accepts the trials of life just as they come, without a murmur." "If she expects to pass along so smoothly all the way and not meet any doubts or difficulties, she will miss it," responded Bessie, earnestly. "I never saw any one who did not at times have their doubts, and I don't think that she will be an exception to the general rule. Even good old Deacon Brown-a man that everybody looks up to as a model Christian-got up last Sunday in meet- ing and told of his darkness and doubts of late, and that sometimes he doubted ever having been converted at all. It made me feel so sorry for him. But then he said that   IANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      335 when he looked back to the time when he was converted, and saw how clear and bright it all was then, he could not doubt being a child of God, and so he still held on to his profession." "But that is not the foundation of Rena's trust, Bessie," answered Philip. "She says the assurance is to be found in God's word, and not in human experiences." "Well, doesn't she suppose that Deacon Brown, and others who have lived lives of faithfulness, would know as much about these things as she does?" asked the little woman, warmly. "It seems like arrogating to oneself an extra amount of wisdom." "Well, I've always been taught to believe just as you do," was the reply. "CTaught to believe that people must do all the good they could and pray often, and hope through this means to reach heaven when they died; but it always appeared like an empty sound to me, and I must say that there is a deal of consistency in her argu- ment, for she takes it all from the Bible." "O, well, I shall not pretend to argue with her," re- sponded Bessie. "Rena is better versed in the Bible than I am, and besides she can out-talk me altogether. But then I think if she lives long--which I am doubtful about--she will find shadows across her path as well as others; but her health is very poor, certainly." "Well, I have never believed any one could know these things either; but the more I see of her the more I am convinced that she is right. I don't know, either, why I never saw how intensely she was suffering through fear during these many years. I used to think that it    <pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6632-00000169"/> 336     LINDEN .HILL; OR, TIE was only put on just to keep me at home; but now, when she tells it all in such a calm, uncomplaining man- ner, I am convinced that she must have passed through infinitely more than she ever expressed, and it makes me hate myself to think I evinced so little concern about it." He spoke in a serious tone, and his thought-revealing eye told that his words were not merely from the lips. "Well, I hope that her reason is not seriously affected, although she has passed through deep waters," remarked Bessie, with a slight feeling of bitterness, for she really thought that Philip had neglected his wife, and she wAs not yet prepared to see anything deeper than the work of man in all the trials through which the weary one had to pass. "But whether it is anything serious or not, these trials have for the time really upset her mind; but I hope it will not last very long. But, as I said before, if she considers herself done with these doubts and uncertain- ties, when her mind gets more settled she'll miss it won- derfully, that's all." "I don't profess to know anything about these things," he answered; " but I do know that her delicate health alarms me, even more than she suspects." "Sit down, mamma, and I'll set the table," rang out Phil's voice from the kitchen. "You are not well enough, and Biddy and I can do it all easily; can't we, Bridget?" "Och! and it's a sight that ye'll be after doing, Master Phil," responded the girl, bobbing her head in true Irish   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      337 style; "and I'd consider meself much better helped with- out ye." "Now, Bridget, didn't I wipe the dishes the other day, and you said they were done well?" continued the boy, somewhat chagrined at the estimate placed upon his services, for Phil flattered himself that he was really capable of doing a great deal, and even intimated that if Bridget was turned off he and Seltie could keep the house in order. But those spasmodic seasons of helping were usually of but short duration, and often very far between. "Don't do that, Seltie," he remarked, jerking vigor- ously at his brother's arm. "This is the place for the cups--there. Now see what you have done?" he con- tinued, as a cup was broken into fragments at his feet. "It was Phil's fault, mamma," sobbed the child, as he wiped the tears from his face upon his sleeve. "Phil jerked my arm, or I would not have dropped it." "If it had not been just ready to fall, that little touch would not send it out of his hand," continued the elder brother; " but I wish he would stay out of my way, any how. When I go to work I don't want to be bothered by a little fellow like him around under my feet." And Phil towered up to his greatest height, although the distance from his head to his feet was not much greater than that of his unpretending brother. "Come, help mamma to fry this chicken, Seltie," whispered the mother. "Let Phil and Bridget do the work if they want to, and we'll take it easy. Here, you can hold the dish."

"Now, can't I help carry the things out of the cellar while Phil gets the chairs?" "Let him have something, Bridget; he won't spill the cake," responded the mother, as they turned away. "And now Phil, you stay here until I go and get the napkins, and we'll have dinner right away." "Yes, go on, mamma, or Aunt Bessie will think that we are slow cooks, I'm afraid," was the rejoinder, as she left the room. "W'ho is going crazy?" she asked, entering the room just in time to catch the last sentence uttered, without dreaming that it was not intended for her ears. "' Why, yourself, of course," answered Bessie, blushing slightly; " didn't you know that you were classed among the insane?" "Me?" ejaculated Rena, while a smile altogether un- like; insanity illumined her happy face. "Well, tell them all, Bessie, that for these many years I have been madly, wildly insane, but that now I am clothed and in my right mind." The quiet happiness of her tone was not like the rav- ings of a maniac, and they felt the force of it. "I often remind myself of the man that was among the tombs," she went on after a moment's silence. "For O! how long I wandered among the dreary habitations of death in the unclothed condition of sin and shamel but the great Physician, whose heart is ever filled with   VA VQ UISHED LIFE-DREA M.       339 compassion, found me and rebuked the rebellious spirit within, and has clothed me with a robe of unchanging righteousness. It is all clear now, but "(' Until I saw the blood, 'Twas hell my soul was fearing, And dark and dreary to my sight, The future was appearing; While conscience told its tale of sin And caused a weight of woe within. "'But when I saw the blood, And looked on Him who shed it, My right to peace was seen at once And I with transport read it; I found myself to God brought nigh, And victory became my cry!' "Isn't that beautiful," she asked, " and so clear. I some- times wonder that every one can't see these things too. I wish that you could see it as I do, Bessie, and find such blessed peace too, for I'm sure you are still carrying a bur- den on your heart." "I have not settled peace," she answered, "and I never expect to be perfect here in this world; but if I am fortunate enough to reach heaven at last, I trust I t shall find it there." "Perfection in these bodies, until they are glorified, we will never have, dear Bessie," she answered; " but perfection in Christ, if Christians, we have now, and it is our privilege to enjoy it. ' Ye are complete in him.' And we should not make the least effort to improve the old natures, but to ' reckon them dead,' and keep them    <pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6632-00000171"/> 340     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE in the place of death, and live in the power of the new life which is born of God." "Well, for my part I never expect to get so holy as that," answered the visitor with a shrug of the shoulders. "I am willing to take a lower place." "And that is pride alone that would prompt you to take it," laughed Mrs. Howard. "Suppose, for example, that some rich individual was to give you a beautiful mansion, with lovely yards and surroundings. You ac- cept the gift, (for it is all a gift, for you pay not a dollar for it,) but you say, I don't deserve this gift, I never did a thing toward earning it, and besides, I have never even been friendly toward the person who has so freely given it to me. And so there is an old smoke-house in one corner of the grounds, and you go in that to live, because, forsooth, you have never earned the gift! That is your position now, Bessie. I am not resting on my individual holiness ,for Christ is my righteousness, sanctification and redemption. It is through His mercy that I possess all things, and not because I have earned them. And if he gives us all these things shall we not accept them?" "Well, if he gives me only the lowest place in heaven, "if it is only the place of a door-keeper, I shall be infin- itely thankful, and feel that it is more than I deserved.', "O, you are still harping on deserts," continued Rena gayly. "What does any of us deserve. What would the father have felt had the prodigal son refused the ring and the shoes, with a seat at his own table, just because he deserved even lower than a servant's place? It is grace-full, free, sovereign grace-that has brought us in,   - IANQCIISHED LIFE-DREAM.     341 and it is only a legal pride that would prevent us partak- ing of the feast-of entering into the full enjoyment of the blessings that have been given us. I know you wish to call it humility, but it is exactly the reverse, for a real, humble person, would receive a gift with thankfulness, without even once questioning his own worthiness or right to receive it." "O, I don't object to the gift," she answered; "but then it seems like a self-righteous spirit to say that we know that we are saved, and that all these things are ours." "But it is far from it, Bessie. Christ died for the un- godly, and I must know that I am such before I can appropriate the merits of his death to myself. ' When we were without strength,' and I must see that I am ut- terly powerless, that He is my only resource. I am a sinner and without strength, and so the word tells me that it was for that class he died, and so I am bound to be included. Then, if He has paid my debt, God will never require a second payment of the same debt-in fact, those sins are 'blotted out' by the blood of the cross, and are to be remembered no more against me forever!" "Do you pretend to say that you do not sin daily?" asked Bessie in a quizzical manner. "Whosoever sayeth that he sinneth not is a liar, and the truth- is not in him," was the immediate answer, as Rena t6ok the napkins from the drawer and laid them upon her arm. "But the very same inspired penman says, that 'whosoever is born of God cannot sin,    <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6632-00000172"/> 342     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE for his seed remaineth in him.' This clearly proves the two natures belonging to the Christian-the old nature, or the life by nature that we all live, termed the 'flesh,' and the new nature, which is God's, and consequently cannot sin. This is what causes the Christian's warfare - the 'flesh lusteth against the spirit.' I don't know where we could go to find this twofold nature in the Christian more clearly set forth, and not as some would understand it, simply a contradiction in God's word. And I cannot wonder that persons who have only the Adam nature should be somewhat confounded with this thought, when so many Christians who have both, under- stand it so imperfectly." '"And faith, and are ye going to talk there all day?" chimed in the Irish girl of all work, as her healthy, glow- ing face appeared at the open door. "And sure Phil's getting tired as well as meself, and the dinner is not im- proved by this standing at all, at all." "Excuse us, Bridget," laughed Mrs. Howard. i"We are all feeling rather intellectual this morning, and in our greed for an intellectual feast we had forgotten all about an ordinary one. We need to vote you our deepest thanks for having brought us back to real life again." "If the baby wakes let me tend it," whispered Seltie, as his eye wandered away to the little slumberer on the lounge, still lost in the mazes of sleep, notwithstanding the earnest conversation that had been carried on above it." "But you must have your dinner, dear," responded Mrs. Howard. "You helped to get it, and then you told me   VAANQUISHED LIP'E-DREAM.     343 you were hungry long ago. Here, Bridget, is a fan for you," she continued, addressing the girl, who stood with arms akimbo awaiting further orders. "Bridget looks a good deal hotter than the stove- redder, I mean," put in Phil, as he took up the chicken- bone which was well-nigh divested of its meat. "I don't know whether she would flash powder quite as quick or not, but sometimes she's pretty fiery." "Come, Phi!, you must not talk so," remarked the mother, just as Bridget entered the room with a pitcher of fresh water, for he took care that she was out of hear- ing when he spoke, fearing that it might at some future time interfere with his powder-flashing arrangements. "Philip must have been experimenting in flashing pow- der," said Bessie, smiling. "The hot stove seems to bring it to remembrance." "Have you been putting powder on the stove again, Phil?" asked Mr. Howard, sternly. "I only just put a little pinch on just to scare Bridget," responded the child, with blushing face;- " but you never told me not to do it before, and I saw you do it one day." Bridget gave a significant shake of the head, as if to intimate that the 'pinch' was a pretty large one, but said nothing. "Well, I tell you now," said the father, emphatically, "and you should have known better any way. I only did it to show you how quickly it would ignite, and the danger there was in meddling with it. Bessie, let me help your plate again," he continued, addressing the visitor;    <pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6632-00000173"/> 344     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE and Phil, glad to have the conversation turned into an- other channel, munched away in silence to the end of his meal. "Now hurry up with the dishes, Biddie," whispered the children, after the dinner was all over, " for mamma says that you may carry the baby and that we may all go off into the grove to play. And I know of such a nice, cool place down by the pond. It is just as shady, and the grass is so nice and green." The girl quickened her pace as she began to clear the things away, and very soon every sign of dinner had dis- appeared, unless it was the hungry stomachs; for Bridget liked these childish sports, and seemed at times to enter into them with real zest and be almost a child herself again. And is it any wonder? Every life, however lowly, needs its recreation; and what is better suited to brighten the gloomy walks of life than the innocent company of children. We pity the impoverished home, even though it may be adorned with all that imagination tells us would make home desirable, that is never awakened by the boisterous strain of childish mirth. There always seems to be lacking a link in the chain of home enjoyment. Happier far would it prove could the sculptured busts which adorn these stately mansions be removed, and in their place substituted the healthy, happy faces of joyous childhood; for the heart can never, without this sacred responsibility-this best of heaven's gifts-learn its capa- bilities for loving, nor the deep endurance that such a love is capable of calling forth.   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       345 "There comes the children and I must hasten home now," smiled Bessie, as the laughing voices were heard coming through the quiet grove. "Birdie and Jennie will think I have deserted them."' "Not until you have taken a cup of tea first," an- swered Rena, as she took the baby from the girl's arms, who with a handful of shavings soon had a roaring fire kindled. "( Now put on the kettle, Bridget, and set the table and let's have tea at once." "But, Rena, it will make me so late," interposed Bessie. "I think I had best go on." "Phil can take you on his pony almost home," was the response; " so you see there is no excuse." It had been a bright, a happy day, and Rena Howard felt its influence upon her soul as the evening shadows closed around her. It was something more to fill her heart with thankfulness, these pleasant interchanges of thought and this true sisterly love. There are so many little auxiliaries to happiness, if we are only disposed to receive them and look on the cheerful side of things; but when these blessings are not received with thanksgiving, they only tend to make us -the more miserable. But we could scarcely single out this day from the other days that glided by in the life of Mrs. Howard, for all seemed serene and joyous as a morn in May. The dark, dismal winter of her life-of horrid fears was over and gone for ever, and she had nothing left her now but to rejoice in the glow of this sweet, unchanging peace! Not that she did not often feel the workings of her carnal nature, that refused to be kept in the place of subjection. As well 22    <pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6632-00000174"/> 346     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE might the farmer pull out all the weeds that encumbered his field and then lie down to loiter away the summer hours, feeling that his work was done, as for the Christian to suppose that, while here below, he is done with the evil of his natural heart. It requires a continual watch- ing and cropping off, as the evil passions of the heart, like some hydra-headed monster, will rise up at some un- guarded point when they have seemingly been completely vanquished. But Rena Howard had learned that the heart, by nature, is but the dwelling-place of these sinful passions, and, consequently, did not doubt the goodness of God in giving her full and free salvation, even when this evil nature rose up in its most uncontrollable form. Her joy did not originate from what she saw in her own heart, but from what she saw in the heart of her Savior God. "Put on a clean apron and collar, Bridget, if you are done your afternoon's work," said Mrs. Howard, as the girl, after much loitering, had arranged everything ac- cording to orders through kitchen and pantry. ", I have a nice little book that I would like to read to you this evening." She soon appeared-her bristly hair brushed moder- ately smooth, and wearing her best white apron and a grotesque collar about her neck that looked as though it might have been fashioned in the time of Queen Bess. But she appeared infinitely pleased with her toilet, and so Rena made no comments on her dress. The book was a thrilling account of Madagascar's martyrs; of the trials and cruel sufferings through which   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      347 those Christians had to pass, and was filled with wild and exciting incidents. Rena explained the more difficult points, dwelling at some length upon God's goodness in even using His own personal intervention in time of danger, and his readiness to forget every failure and for- get every sin of all who trust simply in Himself and look to Him alone for guidance. And thus the evening passed pleasantly away, Bridget readily assenting to all that was said, whether she under- stood it or not. "You see then, Bridget, how only a leaf of God's word proved such an inestimable blessing to a poor, benighted souls" she continued, after she had been reading about a poor heathen who by some -means had come in posses- sion of only one leaf of the New Testament, and which, through God's blessing, became the means of his salva- tion. "How, then, ought we to value God's precious word when we have it in all its fullness, with 'none to molest us nor make us afraid.' " ".That is true, mum," responded the girl, with a serious face. "I often think of that, and I know that I do prize my own precious Bible, which is snugly put away in me trunk." Rena smiled as she wondered m what way she prized the book, not remembering having ever seen her so much as read a word in it; but she went on to say, "It is God's love that is there revealed to us, through Christ, who has borne our sins upon the cross." "Ah! yes, the cross," murmured Bridget, solemnly.    <pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6632-00000175"/> 348     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "It is a swate privilege to look at it only and think of all it's done." "O, the cross is not what we should look at, Brid- get. It is to Him who hung upon it, and that withfaith. The cross was only a symbol of the shame to which He stooped; but when we go to exalting it, we give it a place of honor." "That's so, mum; that's so," she responded, with an assenting nod of the head. But Mrs. Howard felt that the words proceeded only from her lips, and that her heart had not acknowledged the truth of it. But she went on, although the under- taking seemed a hopeless one. "It is through Christ's atoning merits that we can ap- proach nigh unto God, without any human intercessor, for His blood, if we are saved through faith in it, has made 'us kings and priests unto God.' " "That's so; that's so, mum," assented Bridget, again nodding her head, while in her heart she fully believed that there was need of a human priest as an intermediate link between the Savior and the sinner. "There used to be priests under the old Jewish dispen- sation," continued the speaker, i" and their business was to offer up sacrifices, which were only types or shadows of Christ who was to be sacrificed by God himself. And until this sacrifice was really offered, there was no way for man to approach God other than through these priestly sacrifices. But now the veil of the temple has been rent, and we can all approach into the presence of God through the blood of that slain Lamb."   VANQUISHED LIE DREAM.       349 "Och! and the holy St. Peter! and wasn't he a won- derful saint, though?" ejaculated the girl, proving clearly that she had never entered into or listened to a word that had been spoken, "But Bridget, Peter, although he was an apostle, and as such inspired by God, was only a man and subject to like passions as other men. It is- Christ and not Peter that we should revere and honor," answered Mrs. How- ard, earnestly. "God used Peter for making known his thoughts, just as I use my pen for transcribing my thoughts, and that is all. ' Peter knew this, and ever sought to make himself lowly and abased for Christ's sake." "Yes, yes, ye'r honor," ejaculated the girl, and her eye brightened from the effect of a real, positive thought hav- ing entered her mind; " but Peter had the keys of heaven given to him!" Mrs. Howard was rejoiced to see 'the least manifesta- tion of interest in the matter. There is nothing so dis- heartening as a cold, indifferent assent to a matter of great importance, or something we very much wish one to understand, when there is really no interest at heart. It is far more encouraging when we meet with strong opposition than this lukewarm state of existence. "That is partially true, Bridget, and I am glad to hear you speak of it," she responded. "But let us turn to the record and see what it says, ' Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates o hell shall not prevail against it.' Christ is often spoken of as a stone in Scripture, as for instance, ' The stone    <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6632-00000176"/> 35     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE which the builders rejected (meaning the Jews), the same is become the head of the corner.' And again, we read that 'whosoever shall fall upon this stone (it was prophesying of the coming of the Savior) shall be broken, but upon whosoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder.' The Savior was meaning himself, and not Peter, when he said, 'upon this rock I will build my church.' It could be nothing else, because it was the blood of God's Son that purchased the Church. He used similar language when he said, ' I will destroy this tem- ple, and rear it up in three days.' The Jews, and even his disciples, perhaps, thought that it was the Jewish temple, of which they had just been speaking, that He alluded to, and did not know that it was his body, but it was even so. But to continue, 'And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.' You see, Bridget, that it was not the keys of heaven, nor even of the Church, that were given to Peter, but the keys of the kingdom of heaven, which embraces a much wider range. 'The kingdom of heaven,' St. Matthew says, ' is likened unto a man who sowed good seed in his field: but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat.' It was at first com- posed of the good seed, but evil was soon found to be -mixed up with it. Again, it is compared to a grain of mustard seed, which became a great tree, and the fowls of the air (which we believe are generally acknowledged as emissaries of evil lodged in its branches. And as a   VANQUIStHED LIFE-DREAM.      351  third illustration, to a net cast into the sea, gathering up every kind.' So you see that having the keys of this- the kingdom of heaven, and the keys of the Church, or of heaven itself, as you contend, is very different. The apostles were to unlock the storehouse of truth concern- ing this kingdom. God had inspired them for this pur- pose, and, of course, whatever was bound, or ratified, upon earth, by the Spirit of God that ruled and reigned in them, would be equally bound in heaven. That power, as an apostle of Christ, was given to Peter, but it was never handed down by him to others, for there was no apostolic succession. And even before Paul left the scenes of earth to ' depart and be with Christ,' and there be honored with a martyr's crown, he saw that the Church was apostatizing, and knew that after his depart- ure 'grievous wolves would enter, not sparing the flock.' The true Church of God, Bridget, is not the Roman Catholic system, although I do not doubt there being Christians there; but it is composed of every child of God, wherever found, who has been 'born of the Spirit,' bap- tized, not simply with or in water, but by that 'one Spirit, (even the Holy Ghost that was sent down upon the day of Pentecost, when the Church was then and there ush- ered into existence) 'into the One Body,' which is the body of Christ, with Him, the Head in heaven. ' Ye are the body of Christ and members in particular,' the Bible says; and you see, when we look at it in God's light, it breaks up all our restrictions, and we are enabled to see it in a different manner than according to the narrow limits of our own circumscribed views. But    <pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6632-00000177"/> 352     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE as I said before, I doubt not that there are dear chil- dren of God among that system-brethren and sisters with us, who are the children of one common Father- even God. It is not that I would speak harmfully, Brid- get, of that which you have been taught to believe, and I would not have you believe what I say any more than others, unless the word of God emphatically declares it to be truth. We should all read our Bibles more and be guided more by what they say, and not lean so confi- dingly upon what others, however learned and good, may say, or what we have ever been taught to believe." Rena cast a hopeful glance across the table when she had ceased to speak, but there was the same blank ex- pression, the same careless indifference that ever charac- terized her life. The pet creed of her religious views had been touched, but, being resolved to be "true to the faith of the true Church," she had now, as well as ever, closed her ears to all the reasoning that could be ad- duced to prove its fallacy, and was still unflinchingly the same. "And sure, mum, and Phil said that the brindle cow was in the cornfield, just fernenst the barn, this morn- ing," she remarked, abruptly, her thoughts intent upon matters better suited to her taste, for her religious theories she could, without hesitation, leave in the hands of her spiritual guide. "And I forgot to tell ye's of it, sure; but then I thought that Phil would remember it." "You should have told Dick of it," she responded; "but perhaps Phil has done so. Please bring a bowl of fresh water, Bridget," she continued, leaning back wearily *\   VANQUISHED LIFE DREAM.       353 upon the lounge as the girl was turning away. "I have- talked too much, I fear; and it makes my head ache." "And shall I wet this cloth, mum?" she asked, re- turning with the fresh, cool water. "Now, let me put it on your head, and jist lay there till tea is ready," she continued, tucking a blanket about her unshod feet, for Bridget was kind in her own rough way, at least if it did not interfere with her own enjoyment. And thus the evening passed swiftly and quietly away, with the muffled sounds of the children's and Bridget's voices alternately falling upon her ear.    <pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6632-00000178"/> 354     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE CHAPTER      XXVII.

I now feel courage in the world at once To rush and bear it's every joy and grief; To battle with the tempests, and to stand Undaunted 'midst the shipwreck's dreadful crash. -Translation of Goethe. "Come, Phil, and hold this yam  for mamma," ex- claimed Rena Howard, one bright evening in early autumn, as she laid aside her knitting work and took up the unwound skein. "Come, let's hurry up now. Just leave your playthings where they are." "And will papa come home this evening?" asked the child, earnestly, not forgetting that his mother always manifested greater haste in clearing away odds and ends that might be scattered around when expecting her hus- band's return. I expect not," she answered; " but then we need not be careless because he is away." "But I wish he would come, ma. When I'm a man I'll stay at home all the time, I know." "You must expect to have a very attractive home," remarked the mother, smiling. "What is going to be the chief source of its attraction?" Phil seemed to understand fully all that her words im-   IVANQUISHED LIFE DREAM.      355 plied, for a bashful blush overspread his face; but he said nothing for awhile, and his mother went on busily wind- ing her yarn. "Isn't Mrs. Brown an awful ugly woman, mamma?" he asked, at length, his mind perhaps still occupied with thoughts of home attractiveness. "I don't suppose that Mr. Brown considers her such," was the quiet answer. "She looks well enough, I'm sure, when she is dressed up nicely." "Yes, but I would not give a fig for that," continued the boy, in quite a considerate manner. "If I was ever to marry any one I would want her to be pretty in her dirty clothes." "Fie, Phil, all women are homely in their working dress," responded the mother, laughing gayly, while the child, feeling that he had already made a bold stride, hid his face, crimsoned with blushes. "No, they're not," he ejaculated, lifting his head defi- antly; "I know you're not ugly in your dirty dress." "No doubt mamma looks well to you," responded the mother, "for love hides blemishes as well as faults. Willie Brown would, doubtless, tell you that his mother was much handsomer in her untidy dress than your's could possibly be, however elegantly attired; and, con- sequently, if you get such a wife as I hope you may, she will look beautiful to you on working days as well as Sundays, even if others do not consider her handsome." "But I shan't never marry, though," he continued, as he picked up his ball to go and play, for Phil began to think that he had rather gotten a joke on himself. "I was    <pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6632-00000179"/> 356     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE only in fun, anyhow. Oh! there's papa!" he articulated, joyfully, as some one entered the gate and walked slowly toward the house, but seeing his mistake, he presented a somewhat crestfallen appearance, and soon glided quietly away. "You seem quite contented and happy, Mrs. Howard," remarked the village pastor, as he seated himself in her comfortable little parlor. "I hope yourself and family are well." "Quite well, thank you, Mr. Newell," was the quiet rejoinder, " and happy, too, although I often feel that we are not thankful enough for the blessings that are so un- sparingly bestowed upon us." "That is true, that is true," was responded earnestly. "We naturally have unthankful hearts. But one can't wonder at you being happy here," he continued, pleas- antly, after a brief survey of the scene presented through the open window; " and you ought to be infinitely thank- ful, too, for comparatively few are privileged enough to have such delightful scenery forever outspread before them. Nature has faithfully performed her part toward beautifying these lovely hills. If anything is lacking re- quisite for completing the picture, it is through personal neglect." "And there has been plenty of that," she answered, laughing. "Perhaps that is why Nature has been so lavish in her gifts-we are so little disposed to do any thing for ourselves." "Then you must be peculiarly favored ones," was the pleasant rejoinder; " for Dame Nature usually only gives   VAYNQ UISHED LIFE-DREA M.     357 to those who, through patient industry, try to do some- thing for themselves." "I don't know about that," she answered thoughtfully. "I used to think that some were born to walk along the sunny, even walks of life, while for others there was nothing left but the dark, rough ways of care and priva- tion." "And which of those paths was it your fortune or mis- fortune to find?" asked the minister, with a smile upon his handsome face. "Of course, I considered my way a rugged one, and did not look to see the flowers strewn all along it," she re- plied, in anything but a desponding tone. "And I tried hard enough to struggle upward into a smoother path, but it always seemed that fortune refused to lend me even a helping hand." "Perhaps you have only been ungrateful for the favors bestowed upon you," said the visitor; " for there is really a great deal of selfishness in our hearts." "That was just the trouble," was the response. "The outflow of a grateful heart would have sweetened all the bitter disappointments of my life, and flooded my path with sunshine; but. I only lived for self, and wanted to bend everything to forward that one great purpose." "You are quite honest in your confession," was the re- sponse. "And I feel that it is a good thing to rise above self sufficiently to see our excessive weaknesses. It is a duty that we should ever be seeking to perform." Fletcher Newell leaned back in his chair, and remained for a time in thoughtful silence. There was a solemn light    <pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6632-00000180"/> VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.   359   in his dark eye, and as he often bent over the sacred page of inspiration, there was that visible in his counte- nance which told that his heart really prized the precious volume. That he was indeed a child of God perhaps none would dare to gainsay, but the shadows of the Law were still wrapt about his soul, and thus enshrouded he was not calculated to rise to the enjoyment of a perfect peace himself, nor to lead others into the unfettered liberty of a child of God. Rena Howard felt the force of this as she watched him narrowly, for, in her own experi- ence, had she not trodden the same gloomy and tiresome way? "I don't like the word duty in that place, Mr. Newell," she remarked candidly. "To speak of it being our duty to do a thing gives it a legal bearing. If the heart has been duly exercised before God, it ought to be a privilege to walk as he would have us walk, and not something wrapped up in the cold mantle of duty." "I see no inconsistency in the word, sister Howard," he replied. "You surely think that there are duties which every professor ought to perform?" "I most assuredly think, that if we were to do all that his word tells us is in accordance with what the Chris- tian's walk should be, it would be no more than our duty to do it," was the rejoinder. "But if we do this under a sense of duty, instead of being actuated by love and a desire to do His pleasure, which that love will instill into the heart, then it becomes a legal sentiment, and we are verging into the place of a servant instead of a child." "I think your exceptions are so nicely drawn as to be   scarcely perceivable," he answered lightly.   "' The dis-   tinction might do to theorize upon, but when it comes to practice it amounts to the same thing." "I think you are very much mistaken, Mr. Newell," she replied; " there may be but little difference in theory, but much in practice. For instance, if I tell my serv- ant to do anything, it is her duty to obey me. She is hired to do my bidding, and is actuated by no greater claims than the wages she expects to receive. But if I tell my child to do this or that, should a sense of duty (however real that duty might be) alone prompt him to obey me? Is there not a near and sacred tie uniting us, as well as that in view of all that I have done for his sake, which would lend a higher, holier, impetus to the performance of any act? He runs lightly away to do what I may require, not expecting any reward greater than to meet my smile of approbation, while the servant may perform the same duty equally faithfully, but from a very different point of view." "That is all very well, and quite to the point," he an- swered, withe same quiet smile. "But you are doubtless aware that all professors have not been sufficiently exer- cised before God to see it in this light, and must also acknowledge that there are duties for them all to per- form." "Then my dear friend, what good will the perfor- mance of these duties do? The first thing for them to do is to go by faith to God, and there, in His presence, lay the axe of truth to every root springing up in the heart contrary to His will--to be governed entirely by   <pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6632-00000181"/> 360     LINDEN HZL; OR, THE the word of God. The performance of any duty with- out faith to believe that we are really where God would have us, and doing as he would have us, is but the build- ing up of I wood, hay and stubble,' which the fire of his wrath will consume. ' Without faith it is impossible to please God,' and if we have not sufficient faith to believe His word-to know that we are his children by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, we are not prepared for performing any acceptable service. I know full well, Brother New- ell," she continued after a momentary pause, " that such has been my own case in the years gone by, as it is now revealed to me in the light of God's simple truth. Not an iota of acceptable fruit had I been able to bring, and for the very reason that all I did, was through hope of reward/ I would not have acknowledged it then, and in fact I did not then see that it was so. I was really a servant working for wages, and not actuated by any love toward God as a father." "Then do you think that you were not converted be- fore, or that it is but some new light that has been given you of late?" he queried, somewhat puzzled at her en- thusiastic manner. "I can't say," was the reply. "At first, when these truths burst so vividly upon my view, I thought that it was but the joy that ever-transports the new-born soul; but as I have advanced further I feel that I had life be- fore, but no deliverance.

They are placed under the rules of creeds and the opin- ions of other men, instead of walking in the unfettered freedom of the indwelling Spirit's guidance; and no won- der if after they are really delivered they should grieve that Spirit, and, as a natural consequence, become en- shrouded with clouds of darkness and doubt. But I do not pretend to say that I was or was not a Christian then; it is enough that I see my position now, and so I am content to 'forget the things which are behind' and look ahead. And yet the thought will sometimes occur to my mind, 'Could a Christian be so much afraid of death?'" "I see no reason why you should doubt your conver- sion on that account," responded the minister. '"Such fears are not uncommon, even among Christians of great attainments. I have, not long since, been reading of one of Christianity's brightest gems, who thus suffered through fear of death. He made every effort to overcome those fears, but without success, and at length resorted to the plan of having a grave dug, by which he watched all alone through the dreary night, hoping by this means to banish its gloom and thereby lesson its horrors." What an expedient 1" she ejaculated, mentally, but her lips gave no utterance. "I should think that God would have been a more reliable source to have turned to than the grave, in time of trouble." "' This fear," he went on to say, " is a natural element 23    <pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6632-00000182"/> 362     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE of the human heart which it is very difficult to overcome, but a faithful perseverance may at length subdue it." "' In some instances, Mr. Newell, I am led to believe that human power or resolution could never cure it," an- swered Mrs. Howard, candidly. .' In my own case I am sure that the most unremitting perseverance could never have overcome these fears. I labored faithfully to ac- complish this feat, but it only caused the greater strain upon my already excited brain. I honestly believe that if God had not given me peace when He did, a hopeless insanity would have been inevitable!" She pressed her hands upon her forehead as if in pain- ful recollection of the wild thrills that had so often agon- ized her whole being, and a momentary shudder con- vulsed her form as fancy reverted to those dark, dismal hours of mental anguish! But they were all over now, and she had risen above those fears, although with their departure the fondly cherished dream of her life had vanished. "But what a tranquility this peace-God's peace-can bring to the soul!" she murmured, thoughtfully, more as if talking to herself than to another. "How it lifts one above the things of this world and makes him long for the coming of God's Son from heaven!" "It ought to," responded Mr. Newell, gravely, " but does not always do it." "I believe that God's peace will always do so. If we find a peace that does not lift us above these mists of doubt and uncertainty, it is the world's peace and not God's."   VANQISHED LIFE-DREAM.      363 "Ah! but how often do we find positive examples to the contrary," he remarked, as proof of his assertion. "I How often do we find persons who are real Christians, and yet are perplexed and annoyed on every side." "That is simply because they are not willing to take Christ's yoke upon them, Brother Newell. They are not ready, as yoked with Him, to be compelled to walk in the same lowly path that he walked in, and be held in the low estimation that He was held-in. It is one thing to be saved by grace, and quite another thing to walk as one thus saved. We don't like to be ' meek and lowly' as the Savior was, but would rather seek out the 'chief rooms' and occupy an exalted seat. In fact, too many of us want to serve God and yet have fellowship with the world, and He, in the Word, pointedly says that ' whosoever is a friend to the world is an enemy of God.' Don't you see that such is the case?" she asked, earn- estly. "I must confess," he answered, " that there is much inconsistency manifest among many professors. But then I don't think that the world is nearly so bad as you seem to think it. Statistics show that the number of professor s are greatly on the increase. I see no great cause for alarm." "What advantage would be derived from a vast con- course of cowardly, undisciplined men in the day of battle?" asked Mrs. H., animatedly. "Would not a few well-drilled men be of more service than all of them? And isn't it even so with Christians? Their salvation, of course, rests on the finished work of Christ, but their    <pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6632-00000183"/> 364     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE testimony for His truth here depends upon themselves. ' Ye are the light of the world;' and a few earnest Chris- tians who are willing to be abased for Christ's sake will do more toward convincing the unconverted of the real- ities of God's truth than the multitudes who profess and yet walk just as the world walks." "I have often regretted the worldliness of many pro- fessors," he answered, candidly; " but what am I to do about it? I have repeatedly given hints about these things; but it would not do to speak pointedly about it, or I'd soon have no hearers." c"I don't believe there is any good done through preaching down these things while we still walk in fel- lowship with them. How much has it been done, and with how little effect. It is God's Spirit that alone can convince men, and if, as Nazarenes, we are walking in separation from these things, we may be co-workers with God." "But when you speak of separation, what do you mean?" asked Mr. Newell.  "Would you have the Christian always gloomy and morose?" "Mr. Newell, the Christian who is wont to revel in his own tears, or is ever sour and desponding, is one who is at a vast distance from God. It is true that the Chris- tian's joy is not an earthly joy, but it brightens every path of life, and his face should be an index to his heart. But would you shrink from preaching the truth for fear of driving hearers away?" "' Mrs. Howard, my calling is to preach the Word that sinners may be saved," he answered, emphatically. "I   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      365 don't profess to have any authority over any of my flock, and, therefore, when I have preached the Word my mis- sion is done." "Then, if your calling is simply that of an evangelist, you surely are not occupying your proper position," she responded. "Out in the world is the place for the Gos- pel preacher; the assembly of the saints for the pastor or teacher. I can't conceive how a man can be called to occupy two places at one and the same time." "Indeed, my remarks are not so narrow as to be lim- ited to any one class, Mrs. Howard," he responded. "I can address both saint and sinner of my flock at the same time." "But the portion required for them is so different," she answered. s"God appoints some pastors, some teach- ers, etc., for the edification of the body, for the perfect- ing of the saints, but each was to have his proper gift, and these things were not at all confounded." "If God has called me to the place I fill He expects me to look after all and not a part of my flock," he re- marked; " but I have no right to exercise authority over them." "Of course, He does not give you leave to lord it over His heritage. It is Christ's flock, His own blood-bought flock," she continued; " but you, as a co-worker with Himself, should ever be faithful in shielding that flock from danger. For instance, if you see that my walk is low and disorderly as a Christian, and that, as a natural consequence, my feet are being defiled by coming in con- tact with the sins through which I am passing, should \              I '    <pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6632-00000184"/> 366     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE you not apply the pure water of the Word to cleanse my feet, or, in plainer words, to point me to the direct words of God, and show me the moral distance that I have wandered from its precepts?" "I am ready to acknowledge that I ought," replied Mr. Newell; " but I think that you had better go out to preaching, and perhaps you might succeed better in your efforts to revolutionize this wicked world than most of us unfortunate ministers do." "Perhaps I might, seeing, as I do, its need, if I had not two excellent reasons for not doing so," was the re- ply. "And what can they be?" he queried. "Well, the first one is, that 'woman is not to speak in public, but is to learn in silence and subjection." "What! you coming down to that!" he asked, in astonishment. "I thought you were one among that number who thought that women were just as good as men, and had just as much right to express themselves." "And I believe that much yet," was the rejoinder. "I believe that in all respects, save bodily strength and firm- ness of purpose, she is nothing inferior to man. She has, I think, also just as much right to speak in private. The Savior will never condemn those who leave behind the waterpots of earthly things and tell of His love to sin- ners, any more than He did Samaria's repentant daughter. It is in the assembly of the saints as a teacher, or before the world as a public speaker, that God says she is not per- mitted to speak; and who am I, even though it does not flatter my vanity, that I dare to reply against God?"   VANQUISHtED LIFE-DREArM.      367 "That is very true," he answered, smiling. "But what is your other reason for not contributing your mite of in- fluence toward helping to convert this world whose love- liness is so marred by sin?" "Because the preaching of the Gospel is never going to convert the world," she answered, slowly, knowing full well that she was then verging upon forbidden ground. "2Vot be converted! " he reiterated, in utter astonish- ment. "How, then, do you expect the millennium to be ushered in? Christ is to have the heathen for his in- heritance, don't you know?" ' But what does the next verse tell us He is to do with that inheritance?" she asked, solemnly. "He will break them in pieces as a potter's vessel!" "Do you for a moment believe that God will be so unjust as that?" he asked, in a tone that conveyed no little displeasure. "And supposing that I even did not, what would my belief amount to?" was queried. "When God says that such is the case, can my weak opinions change His de- cree? It is enough that He says it is so." "Your views of God's goodness must be very limited," he remarked, naively. "I'm glad that my own are not so contracted." "Mr. Newell, God will then be 'dealing in justice and not in mercy, for the day of mercy will be past-even that mercy which has been so fully, so freely offered for these eighteen hundred years and is still rejected. Justice will now take the place of mercy and enact her stern de- crees! If justice, instead of mercy, were acting now,    <pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6632-00000185"/> 368     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE what dreadful judgments would be visited upon all around us, even as it was in the days of Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, for offering strange fire before the Lord. There's a great deal of 'strange fire' offered now." "I'm sure you talk mysteriously," was the response. "Don't you know that the time of sacrifices and burnt offerings has passed away?" "Of course it has, in a literal sense; nevertheless we are told to offer to God continually the sacrifice of thanks- giving--even the fruit of our lips. And isn't there danger of appearing to offer it when it is nothing but strange fire, having never been kindled by the Spirit of God upon the altar of the heart? Suppose that God were not dealing in mercy now toward men, what dreadful visitations of his wrath would be made manifest." "And so you think God will forget all His promises, and His professed followers here upon the earth will have to partake of the divine wrath that is poured put upon the nations that forget or do not know God?" he re- marked, utterly disgusted with her seeming irreverence and the low standard which she had, according to his view, taken of God's goodness. "I think nothing of the kind, Mr. Newell,"' she re- sponded quickly. "He has said of those who have kept his word and did not deny His name, that He would keep them from the hour of trial that was coming upon the whole earth to try them. Those who are really and truly His will, before that hour of trial, be 'caught up to meet the Lord in the air,' while the false professors will be left to share the fate of a guilty world, to which, in   VANQUISHED L IFE-DREAM.      369 heart, they have ever belonged. The Church being still here, and God's wondrous mercy being still extended, is all that wards off those strokes of justice that have long been pending over a guilty world!" "According to your theories we would have an enviable season of millennial glory,"' - he remarked, in a satirical tone. "If I saw things in the light you seem to see them,. I should never again pray for 'the speedy coming of that day." "The joys ot a millennial reign are for an earthly people," she replied. "But remember that the Christians, or the body of Christians in general, are a heavenly people, and consequently their joy, as well as their place, is in heaven itself. They will doubtless rejoice, even as Christ rejoices when 'the desert shall blossom as the rose,' and, as His own fully acknowledged Bride, reign with Him over the renewed earth; but the Jews, in accordance with His promises of old, will be the centre of all earthly glory!" "I'm sure I cannot understand you," said the minister,. with a gesture of impatience. "Your views would prompt one to let the world go on in sin unhindered. You would not labor for its conversion, nor lend even a helping hand to those who are perishing about us." "Far from me be such a thought," was the rejoinder. "I would go forth into the hedges and highways of this world with the joyful invitation of ' Come! for all things are now ready.' But I would not say, mend your ways and improve the world that is under judgment; turn over a 'new leaf,' and try to be a better man. I would say,    <pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6632-00000186"/> 37     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE tome to Him and be saved; and if you would glorify God on earth, remember that Christ 'suffered without the gate, and that we therefore should go forth unto Him without the camnp' of this world's formal religion as well as its open wickedness, and bear his reproach. For there is a reproach in following the Savior faithfully which many sincere Christians shrink from bearing." "There used to be," he interrupted, "but since the truths of Christianity are being so generally known and acknowledged in Christian lands, it has gradually ceased to be so." "Then if the 'offence of the cross has ceased,' what are we to understand about Christendom?" she re- sponded, seriously. "The preaching of the cross is but foolishness to them that perish; and if it is no longer foolishness, but all receive it according to its high and heavenly import, then surely there is no longer need of preaching it. But we know that it is still an offence, and a great offence, when presented in all of its simplicity and unadorned with wreaths of human reason, so fittingly arranged for covering up the rugged, unvarnished plain- ness of that emblem of man's hatred and God's un- fathomable love! The true Nazarite, as presented in Numbers, was ever to be an object of shame and re- proach." "And no wonder that he should be such," laughed her companion. "Wouldn't we all laugh to see any one so fanatical as to go with unshorn hair and presenting such an unbecoming appearance in general? I Corinthians tells us that it is a shame to go in such a style,"   VANQUISHED L'[iE-DREAM.      37 1 "But the Nazarene was to partake of nothing of the fruit of the vine, from the husk even to the kernel---" "Which is just as the Christian should do, I believe,', he interposed. "But taking it in a literal sense, if it is right to do one of these, is the other not equally bind- ing?" she queried. "The other is utterly absurd," was the rejoinder. "I know that there is a class of persons who hold this as a part of their religious creed, to wear long hair and dress in a certain heathenish style, but I don't think it amounts to anything. They are, nevertheless, sound on some of their doctrines; but this. matter is settled in the quotation referred to in Corinthians." "I think there is as much literal meaning to one part of the Nazarene's requirements as the other," Mrs. How- ard remarked. "The Nazarene of that period was only a type of the true Nazarene of God, even of Christ him- self; and he was in no sense to partake of the fruits of the vine, which is simply an emblem of earthly joy. The Nazarene-of old was to abstain from the fruit of the vine, as a literal thing, and literally to wear his locks unshorn, which, as you have observed, was a shame in the sight of the world. Sampson was a Nazarite from his birth, that is, one who was separated from the world to God, and his strength was in those very things which the world called a shame. And the Christian of to-day is spiritually in the same condition, although he is not called upon to go with unshorn locks nor to clothe himself in ill-fitting or uncouth apparel. This would produce merely an out- ward separation, while God expects a spiritual one. It    <pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6632-00000187"/> 372     LINDEN HJILL; OR, 7 HE is the cross of Christ that produces this separation, when true to Him who hung upon it, and the Christian's strength for running his heavenly race is only found in his abstinence from the wine of earthly joy and his con- formity to the foolishness of that wondrous cross. But alas! like Sampson, we are so prone to sleep in carnal ease upon the lap of some earthly Delilah-some cher- ished treasure, scheme or speculation to which our hearts are wedded, and from which we are doomed to awaken and find our strength departed and ourselves weak and fallible as others!" "What does the woman mean?" muttered the minis- ter, mentally, at the same time looking at his watch and taking down his hat to go. "Surely those reports of in- sanity were not so illy founded, for she talks wildly enough to be peering out through iron bars." "Stay till after tea, Mr. Newell," interposed Mrs. How- ard, noticing his movements. "It is almost time and we will be pleased to have you remain." But Fletcher Newell had other calls to make, and therefore politely declined the invitation. And Rena soon saw him wending his way slowly down thefhill along the road that led to the quiet and romantic village of Linden. "Don't I come often enough to suit you?" asked Mrs. West, a neighbor, only a short time after Mr. New- ell's departure, as she threw aside her hat and parasol, and seated herself in the great arm-chair. "I have read and sewed, sung and played, and last of all took a com- fortable little nap, just to while away the- time, but it   -ANQ UISHED LIFE-DREAM.      373 seems to drag, nevertheless. These days are so long and lonely." "The days do seem long; but if you had a few boys to lumber around, I don't think you would find it very lonely," answered Mrs. Howard, as she took up a torn garment to mend. "Just see what trouble they make." "And would you be willing to be without that trou- ble?" asked the visitor, who was herself childless. "By no means," was the response. "I don't see how people who have no children manage. I'm sure I should always feel like there was something missing if I had none. And then children are so convenient now and then. If you misplace or lose anything, it is so natural to say the children had it. Then, if you want to go some place and are doubtful about the propriety of going, it is so common to say,' O0, the children wanted to come and I thought I would humor them.' Mrs. West, how do people who have no children manage in such cases?" c O, they have to acknowledge their own childishness and go just to please self, I guess --" "Which is really the most honest way of doing," was interposed. "I have heard persons use those very ex- pressions when the children, I am sure, might have pleaded by the week to go, and without success, if the parents had not wanted to go themselves. I don't like to see people try to screen themselves from blame by any such subterfuges." "You have had Mr. Newell for a visitor this afternoon, I see," remarked Mrs. West, indifferently. "He called at our house on his way back to the village." ,    <pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC6632-00000188"/> LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "Oh! yes; we have had quite a visit, too," laughed Rena. "We have made good use of the time -- "I judge so, as he wanted to know if your mind was altogether right," was replied, as Mrs. West arose to go. " He seems inclined to consider you somewhat fan- atical." "Don't go yet; I'm not very insane," was pleaded. But Mrs. West had only come to call, and her various household cares were waiting her return, and so she must hasten back. "Why is it that people will persist in calling these plain truths insane fancies," soliloquized Rena, as again left alone she sat down to think.  "It's God's truth, all laid down in the Bible, without a shadow to darken it, and still they call belief of it fanaticism. But such has ever been the case."    375   CHAPTER XXVIII. DISCUSSIONS. "From lowest place, when virtuous things proeeed, The place is dignified by doer's deed." The sun, which at first had but tipped the lofty spires or burnished the cottage windows, which, reflecting back his rays, presented at a distance the appearance of con- suming fires, had now seemingly risen to a greater height, from whence he could look down upon the lovely scenes below. The inhabitants of Linden were all astir now, all actively engaged in their business or their pleasures, for activity, as elsewhere observed, was a striking character- istic of the place, and whether her inhabitants engaged in some remunerative pursuit, or engaged in croquet or the exhilarating amusement of a base ball game, they were apt to hold on to the chosen amusement with bull-dog tenacity; and generally not until this was by constant use worn threadbare, and other callings were almost placed among the list of recreations, would the infatuation cease. And then the brief settling down was soon inter- rupted by the hatching out of something else, and again were seen numerous devotees pursuing the new-born pleasure phantom. But notwithstanding all of this, as     <pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6632-00000189"/> 376     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE we have before remarked, Linden was a delightful and highly-cultivated little place and a desirable rural retreat away from the city's busy turmoil. It combined many of the advantages of both city and country, as far as in- telligence and refinement of society were concerned, and yet could boast of the pure, untainted air of country life which was capable of lending a glow of health to the ,cheek and elasticity to the step, if rightly used. But upon this particular day there was greater activity mani- fest than usual, as the cannon and bursts of military music reverberating through the surrounding hills would fully attest. Linden had celebrated her national indepen- dence, and now the few colored inhabitants--those images of their Maker tinged with ebony hue-were go- ing to celebrate their Emancipation Proclamation, and it was in honor of this that all the ado was made. And truly and rightly did many a heart in the bosom of Africa's sable sons respond to the rallying shout of free- dom. And is it any wonder?  The galling, cankering chains of slavery had long weighed heavily upon body as well as soul; then is it any wonder that they should re- joice that that curse at least was removed and they were free? Perhaps many of these did not see that there is a darker, deeper curse still holding this world in thraldom, a curse which will require a more terrible chastisement than even the late national war, horrible as that was in all its dreadful forms, before the curse is removed and the earth can rejoice in millennial glory. But such is most assuredly the case, as God's Word declares. Never- theless, it is meet and proper that the world should re-   VANQUISHED LIFE DREAM.         3" joice in this priceless gift of freedom, and render becom- ing honors to the world's benefactors! "Though riches to others be given, Their corn and their vintage abound, Yet, if I have treasures in heaven, Where should my affections be found? Why stoop for the glittering sands. Which they are so eager to share, Forgetting the wealthier lands That form my inheritance there? "Ye palaces, sceptres and crowns, Your pride with disdain I survey; Your pomps are but shadows and sounds That pass in a moment away. The crown which my Savior bestows Yon permanent sun will outshine; My joy everlastingly flows- My God, my Redeemer is mine!" The words were sung through in a clear, cheerful tone of voice as Rena Howard sat beneath the lofty Linden trees busily plying her needle, for the happy thoughts that were continually welling up in her heart must find utterance in word or song. This song was one of her mother's favorites-that mother whose soft, sweet voice had long been hushed, and her gently-beaming eye closed in death! And this consideration alone was sufficient to endear it to her heart, for through all the meandering paths of life the earthly joys or sorrows that encompassed her way could never fully recompense her for the loss of that mother's love! 24    <pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC6632-00000190"/> 378     LINDEN HILL; GR, THE "O mamma, mamma, just listen to the music," cried little Selton, with breathless haste. "Phil and I have been half way down the hill listening to it, and it's so nice; don't you think so?" "It sounds very sweetly," she responded, more in an- swer to their animated looks than questions, " although I must say that I had scarcely noticed it before. As is usual with most things, distance seems to lend enchant- ment," she continued, listening to the strains that burst upon her ear, " for the more rugged accompaniments belonging to military music lose all their harshness as it rises to our own green hill. So you see that we are get- ting the richest of its sweetness without any of its toil." "It makes a fellow feel brave enough to face the rough edges," remarked Phil, as he trundled his hoop across the green lawn. "O, I wish papa was here," cried Seltie, more and more exultant. ," I wish I were a man right now." She smiled faintly at the child's rhapsody, and thought of the wild, extravagant dreams of ambition which even the soul-stirring strains of music were capable of inspir- ing. But although her cheek was unusually pale this morning, and her limbs seemed to falter beneath the weight of her slender form, she felt that, come what might, she could trust her child with all his wayward impulses in the care of Him who had for the time en- trusted him to her own. "I trust you will excuse our intrusion," smiled Mr. Newell, as he came unperceived up the smooth walk, leading a little one by the hand. "The noise and con-   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       379 fusion are rather too much for, Mrs. Newell, and as we have been out riding, we chanced to see that you were here. We just thought we would make you a short call and rest ourselves." "I am sure you are very welcome," responded Mrs. Howard, leading the way into the house, where she speedily removed hats and other things, which were soon put snugly away. "My wife is easily tired out, Mrs. Howard, and con- siders it quite a treat at any time to ride out in the open air," continued the minister, as he lifted a robust child upon his knee, " and I, of course, wish to indulge her as much as possible. But to-day it seemed as if every one was in town excepting yourself, and we felt that we might be privileged to monopolize the enjoyments of the whole of the country." "I get so worn-out at home," Mrs. Newell chimed in, with a really troubled expression, for although a worthy, she was a weak, shrinking woman, but poorly qualified to battle with the cares of life. c"Minnie is a good girl, and takes care of Freddie faithfully, and get's along nicely with the work; but then it seems that so much care falls, upon myself. It's really trying." Rena smiled as she inwardly contrasted the cares and responsibilities of her neighbor with those of herself; but then Mrs. Newell, poor, dear thing, with her shrinking, vine-like nature, could be more troubled about the exact sort of trimmings suited for her child's dress than would really be needful in the management of a farm. "Mrs. Howard, my wife is one of those nervous sort    <pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC6632-00000191"/> 380     LINDElN HILL; OR, THE of persons who can't bear anything," continued the hus- band, tenderly; " altogether unlike yourself. Why, it would kill her to be left alone and have to see after things as you do. It is well for Mr. Howard that he found a woman so well able to perform these duties." "I have learned to believe that a person can do much more than they may at first think they can," she replied, while a twinge of the old Adam nature arose in her heart, for she thought of the manyf burdens that her wearied heart had borne. "I believe now that I could bear any thing that any person could bear and still live on." c" O, how much better to be so constituted," interposed the visitor; " how much I would like to be so." "I have already gone through trials, both bodily and mentally, that, could any one beforehand have revealed them to me just as they came, I should have pronounced them utterly unbearable; but I did bear them, and could bear more if needful, I fully believe. It's not to be known by us how much we can endure when God wills it." "You Inust have strong nerves, Mrs. Howard," re- marked the minister, not realizing that many an indivi- dual with unimpaired nerves has lived a life of shrinking cowardice. "On the contrary, Mr. Newell, my nervous system is greatly impaired by an excess of mental stimulant, but my will has ever been strong. It is the will that is the needed engine for carrying people through trial or suffer- ing; and if this will be lacking, I care not how healthy the nervous system may be-if it can, properly speaking,   VANQUISHED L FE-DREAM.      381 be termed healthy and well-balanced without this will- we naturally shrink from trial. I don't know how physiolo- gists would class the idiotic-whether among the strong- willed or those possessed of nervous deficiencies, as there seems to be a tendency toward both." "I can't understand how Sister Howard can be so nervous and yet bear up so bravely," chimed in Mrs. Newell, as tremblingly she nestled still lower down in an easy chair, for the very thought of trouble made her tremble. "But then I'm so sensitive that I can't bear pain, and; in fact, anything else like other people. But why did you not go and rejoice over the anniversary of a second freedom? With your matter-of-fact nature, surely you could enter into it." "Can't I be thankful for the heaven-sent gift as well here?" she asked. "O, but then you would openly acknowledge your gratitude, and also be offering a tribute of honor to the world's benefactors."' "Then, if mingling with the world I seek to honor its benefactors, I must acknowledge myself to be of it, which God's Word tells me I am not," "What! and would you not honor the day of national independence, and rejoice that such independence has been wrought?" asked Mrs. Newell, in an elevated tone of voice.

"And do they not deserve these honors?" he asked, in the same animated tone. "Indeed they do, and richly deserve it," she responded, earnestly. "It would be a base and ungrateful world that would not rejoice and honor its benefactors. But do you belong to this world, Mr. Newell?" she asked. "Am I not protected by its laws? and in considera- tion of such privileges should I not be loyal to it?" "Is a Frenchman necessarily obliged to be loyal, or, in other words, to love the American institutions when his interests are in France? If he has property here he is to pay tribute to the Caesars of the country, because to such government his tribute is due. If he is protected by its laws he is to have a heart filled with gratitude for that protection, and should in all respects be subject to them; but should his heart necessarily be false to his own coun- try, or is he a citizen here because of his sojourn?" '"Of course he is not; but he need not dishonor our country because his heart is wedded to his native France." "Most assuredly he should not," was the ardent re- sponse, " for it is written, ' thou shalt not speak evil of the rulers of thy people.' But God has expressly de- clared that we 'we are not of this world,' that our citi- zenship is in heaven, and can we in heart be wedded to   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.       383 this world when our possessions are above, however much we may thank God for its free institutions for our own and for the world's sake." "You would make a strange world of this, Mrs. How- ard, according to your theories," he remarked, shrugging his shoulders. "If you were a minister, and were to advocate such a theory, you would be drummed out of respectable society." "Mr. Newell, I must remind you again that this is not my theory, but simply what you will find in God's Word. I claim no honor of these truths for myself, and if not believed, it is not my words but God's that are re- jected. As to being drummed out of society, I should expect that, if my walk corresponded with my teachings. There never was but one perfect man on earth, and He, because of the unvarnished truth and corresponding walk, was cast out, and He told us that if 'they hated me they will hate you also.' 'If ye were of the world, the world woud love its own; but because ye are NOT of the world, but I have CHOSEN you out of the world, there- fore the world hateth you /' "I "Mrs. Howard, I don't believe you are strong enough to study on these deep matters as you do," remarked Mrs. Newell, after a short silence, seeing that her hus- band was not disposed to speak, and feeling- that some- thing ought to be said. "It would kill me to study so much, and sol I never trouble myself about them." "I don't study at all, Mrs. Newell," responded Rena, pleasantly. "These things come to me as gently as the    <pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6632-00000193"/> 384     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE morning dawns. It is past mental exertion that has in- jured my health; these truths are health inspiring." "I'm sure it would hurt me," was responded; "but then I have so little strength for endurance." "But there's nothing to do in this instance," she an- swered; " and even if there were, the Bible says that we 'can do all things through Christ strengthening us.' In former years I walked in my own strength, which surely must have failed had not God, all unknown to myself, had a purpose in sustaining me." "And what do you suppose that purpose was?" asked Mr. Newell, in a quizzical manner, having fully recovered himself. "That being redeemed at such a wondrous cost, 'I should not henceforth live unto myself,' but unto Him who died and rose again." "And how do you propose to do that?" he asked. 6"By simply giving up, my own will, being content to be anything or nothing, according to His pleasure, and in all things seeking nothing more than to be guided by His word." "I don't know how you calculate to be guided by His word, unless it is to live under the creeds and doctrines laid down in the New Testament," he continued, with a twinkle in his eye, as he glanced toward his wife. "And I would ask wherein you have deviated from that so far as doctrinal truths are concerned in the years that are past?" "You see that we have heard about your leaving us,"   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      385 smiled Mrs. Newell, as her husband paused to await her reply. "'I have left none who belong to the Savior," she re- spondled, calmly. "I am a member together with all who have been born of the Spirit, baptized into that One Body, the same that I ever was, only I can't walk where I once did: for ' how can two walk together except they be agreed?" "But what has caused you to disagree with us, Sister Howard?" he queried. You once were agreed and walking peacefully together with us." "Not peacefully, my dear brother," was the quick re- joinder; "or if I walked in peace then, it was a carnal peace, for while in this position I had never really known God's peace." "Then I'm glad to know that you have such settled peace now," he continued. "But I can't see what strange fanaticism has taken possession of you that you should be dissatisfied with our church, for I think there is not a more orderly little church in the whole village than mine." "I don't understand from God's word that you have any church, Mr. Newell," she remarked, emphatically. "There is but one Church, and that is the Church of God-the Body-or, as sometimes termed, the Bride of Christ." "And what denomination do you pretend to say that that is?" "Neither," was the response. "But the Church in- cludes believers from all creeds and sects as well as out    <pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6632-00000194"/> 386     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE of them. The word, you know, says that ' by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jew or Greek, bond or free.' So\ou see there are not many bodies, but one." "I have never for a moment intimated that there were not Christians in other denominations," he responded, while a flush, perhaps of displeasure, suffused his face. It is, the world over, the surest way to excite a man's ire, to touch his religion, be it what it may. Heathen nations will contend for what they consider their religious rights and privileges, and battle-fields have been stained with gore, all through the influence of national religions. Religion seems to be a natural element of the human heart, else why would those who have no higher incen- tive than nature is capable of giving, ever seek it out in some of its varied forms. Perhaps it may afford an ar- gument in favor of those who contend that there are roots in the natural heart capable of growth and expan- sion, and which, if properly trained, might bring forth ' immortal flowers and fruits." Ah! but the fruits of the Spirit of God are peace, joy, love, etc. The individual who is governed by the Spirit of God will never manifest the spirit of the world or resort to carnal weapons in defence of his religion. The more valuable the article the more reprehensible the counterfeit the world over. How dreadful, then, when God's religion, which although it is but the fruits of Christianity, is nevertheless " pure and undefiled"; how shocking, we must say, when it should be used as an ex- cuse for gratifying the lower and more fiendish passions   VANQUISHED LIFE DREAM.       387' of the soul! And this we are bound to admit is the way of all religions not instigated by the Spirit that dwells in those who are really born of the Spirit. "There is a way which seemeth right unto men, but the end thereof is death!" "I believe, however, that our Churchl is nearest," con- tinued Mr. Newell, "nearest in accordance with the teachings of Scripture." "What do you really believe that the Church is?" she asked, looking earnestly into his- face. "I believe a Church to be an organized body of be- lievers, all holding the same doctrines, rules and creeds, with suitable rulers and governors over them. Each member should have a right to vote for or against the admission of any new resolution." "There seems to be a little difference in your definition of a Church and that given in the word of inspiration." "I contend that our creed is laid down in the New Testament," he remarked, significantly. "I am not afraid to have it tested." "Well, then, let us compare these definitions. In the first place, you say that the Church is composed of an organized body of believers. Let us see what the Apostle tells us it is: ' Ye are the Body of Christ (not a body of believers) and members in particular.' And he goes on, in Corinthians, to tell us how these different members are set in the bodv, having different offices, and yet all con- stituted one body, and the members cannot be independ- ent one of another. And," she continued, "the moment you make the Church an organized body of believers-    <pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6632-00000195"/> 388     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE one body here and another body there-you cause schism in the One Body; and you of one creed can and do say, to those of another creed, 'I have no need of thee.' And again, it is said in Timothy: ' And he is the head of the Church, which is His body.' And still again, when speaking of its unity, though showing it out in a little different phase, he says: 'And ye, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God.'" "We all acknowledge that Christ is the head of the Church as much as you do," remarked Mr. Newell, somewhat tartly. "We know that ' He is the true vine,' and that these different branches of the Church belong to Him." "Not branches of the Church," interposed Mrs. How- ard. "'I am the vine and ye (speaking of individual Christians) are the branches.' This abiding in the vine and bringing forth fruit is an individual and not a collect- ive matter." "Well, don't you believe that the Church, whichever one it was, that Christ said he would build upon a rock, was organized?" "It don't matter what I believe, Mr. Newell," she re- sponded. "But let us turn to God's word and see what He says. That is the standard for us to go by. What does it say? Did they stop to organize upon the day of Pentecost-the birth of the Church on earth-when they were all ' with one accord in one place,' and were all, in- dependent of nation or tongue, baptized both internally and externally with the Holy Ghost?"   VANQUISH ED ZIFE-DREAM.      389 "Who were assembled? Wasn't it members of the Church already that were assembled there?" "It was Jewish believers, and, as such, saved persons, as were the Old Testament saints; but they were' not built up by the Holy Ghost into that holy spiritual tem- ple-the Church. Besides, they stood on purely Jewish ground, and the ' middle wall' separating Jew anid Gentile had not yet been abolished. These very disciples were, doubtless, with Jesus when he told themn that he was going to build His Church-a thing of the future, al- though for ever in the counsels of God-and proves that the Church did not exist then. But they often met as Jewish believers in the Messiah and celebrated the Pass- over; and now, when the day of Pentecost was fully come, the Church was born and all obstacles to the full flow of God's grace removed. But, as I said before, do you suppose that there was any thought of human organ- ization to help God's mighty power to control the hearts and ways of men?" "Doubtless not at that time; but I have no doubt but it took place afterward." "Our not doubting a thing will never make it true; but where will we find proof of it?" she asked. "How could elders and deacons have been chosen if there had not been an organized body?" he asked, in a defiant tone. ":I think that is sufficient proof that it was SO." "I once thought so, too," she responded, calmly, " but I have since found out that it was only my belief, for I can't find it in God's word."    <pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6632-00000196"/> 390     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "Stuff! Nonsense!" he articulated, with a disdainful motion of the hand. (I should think that any sane person might see that when deacons were chosen, such was unquestionably the case." "And there is the trouble, Mr. Newell," she went on, without seeming to notice the home-thrust. "There is too much considered unquestionable, and therefore taken for granted without ever being questioned at all. Let us look for one moment at the state of the Church when these deacons were chosen. We read here in the Acts of the Apostles, iv chapter and 32d verse: 'And the multi- tude of them that believed were of one heart and one mind; neither said any that aught of the things which he possessed were his own, but they had all things in com- mon!' Every thing was held in common.   It was not in the licentious sense that certain sects of the present day, who themselves claim to be sanctified in the flesh, pretend. This pretense is heinous in the extreme. As before said, the flesh even of the Christian, or natural body, will never be changed for the better until it is glorified; until ' mortality is swallowed up of life.' And yet the Christian is sanctified in the new life which he lives before God, for he has Christ, and Christ 'is made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemp- ,tion.' A correct knowledge of this fact will clear the mists away from the two conflicting passages where it says, ' Whosoever sayeth that he sinneth not, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;' and again, ' Whosoever is born of God can not sin, because his seed remaineth in him.' The carnal nature is sin itself, and can never until   VANQUISHED LIFE- DREAM.      39r glorified reach that point where it will not sin; but we have the assurance that under this difficulty ' we have an advocate with the Father, even Jesus Christ the righteous.' But this new life which is formed in the soul through faith in Jesus cannot sin. Its nature and its source is God. himself, and as such is incapable of sinning. It may be overshadowed and hidden entirely, even from the posses- sor's view, and in this condition others, of course, cannot see so much as a ray of its heavenly light, but yet it is sinless. But I was about to run away from my subject," she continued, laughing. "It was only worldly posses- siois that were held in common, and the more sacred re- lationshipS of life were by no means ignored. Each sold his possession and brought the price and laid it at the Apostles' feet. But they so fully recognized that it was not the Apostles but the Holy Ghost that ruled and di- vided among them, that, in the case of Ananias and Saphira, they are plainly told that they had not lied unto men but unto God. Let us turn, Mr. NewellU to the sth chapter. I know that you are more familiar with these things than myself, but then we can never know so much but what we can learn more. We see in those days, when the number of the disciples were multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily minis- tration. All possessions were in common and 'distribu- tion was made to every one as he had need.' These widows who were not fully of the Jewish race and had no natural protectors, had been unwittingly overlooked in having their daily wants supplied. Then it was that    <pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC6632-00000197"/> 392     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE the twelve called the multitude together to appoint men over this business. These deacons were only chosen to serve tables-not the Lord's table, for you will see in Corinthians that the Holy Ghost rules there and uses whom He will-but only to serve in the capacity of dis- tributors, and consequently since the Church's declension they could be of little use." "If they were needful then, I can't see why they are not needed as much yet," remarked Mr. Newell, in a listless manner. "s Mr Newell, when a ship puts out to sea, all properly equipped with bands and rudders and all the necessary things that seafaring lives so well understand, besides the pilot's eye, she needs a captain's voice to keep every thing moving on harmoniously. But suppose a tempest rises: the ship is dashed into a thousand pieces and the hopeless wreck is carried by the waves toward the land, while its hapless crew, each clinging to spars and broken masts, are drifting through the foamy surges, what good would the captain's voice do these? or could it even be heard above the wild tumult of the waves?" "Of course not; but I don't see that that has anything to do with the subject in question. If the Church ever needed these helps, as it surely did, it needs them just as much to-day." "And if you will go out upon the vast waste of waters and gather up the broken fragments, and weave them into a ship again, it will need its captain. The Church, which came forth so gloriously on the day of Pentecost, soon began to decline, even before the Apostles had left   VANOQUISSHED LIFE-DREAM.'     393 the scene; and since then a great change has been wrought. All things are not held in common now, even among the schisms that have been made in the One Body that once all 'spake the same things.' Look how unlike the early saints, who laid everything at the Master's feet, the Christian of to-day struggles and wrangles after worldly possessions. What could a deacon do in these days in making distributions, even in one of these so- called branches of the Church?" Mr. Newell wiped his face and remained silent for a time. He had long contemplated making this visit in order to try and reclaim the sheep that he considered was wandering from his fold, but he saw little prospect of a joyful return. "Well, where is the consistency in admonishing the saints to hold fast the ordinances as they were deliv- ered them, if these things were not to descend down to the present day?" he asked, at length. "Most assuredly, they would have been needful now as then, had not the Church left her first love. When her love toward Christ began to wax cold then her affections began to go out after the world, and as the 'feet follow the heart,' so her walk soon got low and she began to treasure up things for herself, and not for Him. As I said before, Paul knew this would be, for he said that after his departure there would arise men who would draw many disciples after them, and that the flock would be scat- tered." "I can't see just what you would be driving at," he  remarked, in a fidgety manner. "But you must not ex- 25    <pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC6632-00000198"/> 394     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE pect all to see alike. You may understand these things one way, and I may understand them differently; now who's right.?" "Neither, I must say, if it is our own understanding that we are trusting. Let us give up all of our precon- ceived opinions and go simply to the Word of God, just as though we had never heard anything about it be- fore. It may and will conflict with some of our indi- vidual views; but if we are willing to be guided by the Word of God alone, we will be willing to let our views slide. Right here is to be found the secret cause of all these growing schisms. We are taught to believe this or that because our fathers believed it, or the minister preaches it, or because, forsooth, it belongs to the creed of the system to which we belong, without ever examin- ing carefully to see if it is in exact accordance with the teachings of the volume of inspiration." "What do you call a schism, Mrs. Howard?" asked the minister, stroking back his moustache uneasily. "It seems to me that the position you take might be more properly termed schism than anything that I know of- really breaking away from the faith which your fathers loved and honored." "That is just the trouble, Mr. Newell. Because my fathers walked thus I am expected to do so, whether it is where God would have me walk or not. But as for the meaning of schism," she continued, "I think that is clearly defined in the first chapter of I Corinthians. The Apostle there addresses them as the ' Church of God at Corinth, with all that in every place call upon the name of   PANQ1iSHED LIFE-DREAM.       395 the Lord pesus Christ, both theirs and ours.' And then, in the tenth verse, he beseeches them, in the-name of the Lord Jesus, that they all speak the same things, and that there be no divisions among them, and that they be per- fectly joined together in the same mind and the same judg- ment." " "But how are you going to make them have the same mind?" he asked, somewhat piqued. ' Must they all come over and be made to believe just as you do?" "No; as I said before, I don't want my belief, as you term it, to have the least weight with any one. It is God's plain Word alone that is to decide this matter. It is to that that I again appeal, and not to what I believe, or what I can say. But," she continued, " the Apostle goes on in this very chapter to tell us about these schisms. He tells them that it had been told him that there were divisions among them--one saying he was of Paul, an- other of Apollos, and another of Cephas, while others were of Christ. This he tells them (in chapter I x , third and fourth verses,) is the fruits of carnality, and reproves them sharply for it. Even the name of Christ, when used to designate a sect or division, was a carnal thing, and as such condemned. It was destroying the unity of the one body, as is shown in the twelfth and following verses of the twelfth chapter of this book, and in so doing the members could not have the same care one for another. "Do you," she asked, "have the same care for one of another denomination that you have for one of your own?" "Well, yes; of course I can't watch after every one    <pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC6632-00000199"/> 396     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE though," he answered, with considerable hesitation. "If I can look after the welfare of my own Church, it looks like that was enough for any one man to do." "But that is not the point in consideration," she re- plied. "Your nearest neighbor might be in need of bodily or spiritual help, but not be of your persuasion; won't you leave him and go to lavish your kindness upon another who holds the same hereditary doctrine as your- self at a much greater distance, and pass your nearer and perhaps more needy neighbor by?" "Of course; that would be but natural," he answered, nervously; " for, as I said before, one can not look after every one, and his own church is expected to help him." "c But that is not the point," answered Mrs. Howard, firmly. "The Apostle says that there should be no schism in the body, and that the members should have the same care one for another." "I can't stop to continue this conversation any longer," he remarked, rising to go. "' Mrs. N. is growing very nervous, and we must get back." "Not now," was the firm rejoinder, as Rena seated the minister's wife again. "You shall not go until after dinner, and after that is over Mrs. Newell may take a comfortable nap while we continue our subject." "I do feel so anxious for you to see these truths," she continued, earnestly. "The position you occupy enables you to wield such an influence."   tVANQUISHED LIFE DREAM.         397 CHAPTER XXIX.

"I believe that you were telling me that I ought to look after the whole world, and not simply after those over whom, I have been made an overseer," laughed Mr. Newell, as he leaned back in the easy chair. "Yes, yes," she   answered; " and I'm  sure if God should call you to travel over all the inhabited earth your mission would be to feed the   /ock of Christ, no matter who nor What he might be, wherever found, and not sim- ply feed Baptists, Methodists, Episcopalians, etc."    <pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC6632-00000200"/> 398     LINDEN .ILL; OR, THE "O, well, that is not done, and you can never compel persons to do so," he answered, while a shade of dis- pleasure crossed his face. "These customs are prevalent, and Iat least have no power to change them." "But you have power to 'come out from among them and be ye separate,'" she replied. "When you see that thtse factions are but dividing up the one body, you can at least have no fellowship with it yourself." "And where would you have me go?" was the signi-= ficant interrogation, "Go forth without the camp of this world's creeds and human opinions to Christ; go to no individual but to Him alone. If traveling in the same outside path you chance to meet even one who is willing to occupy this place of reproach which He had to bear, be thankful for it. If only two or three meet together outside of everything else and simply around the name of Jesus, He has prom- ised to be in their midst. Isn't that enough? Are we wanting some centre besides Christ around which we can come? Do we want to follow some Paul or Apollos, some Calvin, some Luther or Wesley, however worthy those persons may be, instead of Christ?" "This is a mere man of straw that frightens you, Mrs. Howard," he answered, with a toss of the head; " a mere foolish fancy, and that is all." "But it is God's own Word, Mr. Newell," was the earnest response. "Can it be mere folly to acknowledge that?" "I think such notions are mere folly,"' he continued. "And to prove this, let me illustrate it by example. Sup-   VANQUISHED LIFE DREAM.      399 pose a man had a number of sons. He named one John, another Peter, and another Thomas, and so on. But he comes down to one who says, 'I don't want any name; I only want to be called father's boy.' Where would be the consistency in such a requisition?" he asked, with an outhurst of laughter. cc That is only a deduction from human reasoning, -and not a proof from God's Word that this is not right," "Prove it to me from that volume," she answered, laying her hand upon the sacred book, " and I will be convinced." Mr. Newell winced but said nothing, and so she went on. "If the father had said expressly this child shall be called nothing but my child, then surely it would be right for him to be called so, no matter how ridiculous it might appear to others, for the father would have a perfect right to do as he pleased with his own child; but this is a very different thing. We are a heavenly people, and as such God does not need to address us by name, but by His Spirit, thereby revealing His will to us. As individuals here we must necessarily address one another by individ- ual names, for we have no other way of appealing to the understanding; but when we speak to one here it is an earthly matter-a natural communication-and, con- sequently, if these names of creeds are used for distin- guishing people here on earth, it is a thing of earth and not of heaven.

All through the epistles you see that the Apostles- addressed believers as ' the saints of Christ Jesus' at such and such places, using no other earthly distinction between them." "O, well, I see there is no use in arguing this subject further, for we can never get together," he replied, impa- tiently. "But, thank God, this is the faith that my fathers held, and I expect to live and die true to it." "Then, if you are determined," she answered, with a sigh, " it would be folly to pursue the subject further. I have only referred you to God's Word and not mine, and if you reject it, it is Him with whom you will have to do." "And I amn very glad that it is," he answered, coldly. "But it does seem, passing strange that after wise and learned divines have spent their lives in service for God and making that Word their study, a few bigoted persons should rise up-most generally of an inferior grade-and claim to know so much more than them all. Do you claim that this illiterate class, which unfortunately you have been duped into following--and I very much regret it, for you might have been an ornament in the Church had you chosen," he added, somewhat softened- "have more intelligence than all these learned pro- fessors?" "As far as human wisdom is concerned, doubtless many are inferior to these worldly wise ones," she answered; "but we can only say, ' I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes.,   PANQUISHEED LIFE-DREAM.      401 I, for one, make no pretensions to wisdom, for I have learned that the 'wisdom of this world is foolishness,' and therefore do not covet it as I once did." "And don't you consider wisdom a necessary thing?" he asked. "Yes, worldly wisdom for worldly purpose's," she re- plied. "And, like every thing else in this world, it may be used to glorify God. I fully appreciate intelligence. There is nothing that I so much admire as an intelligent, well-balanced mind, and nothing more necessary than to early and earnestly commence this process of thorough mental culture. But I would not confound human wis- dom with God's wisdom. The two must be kept in their respective places." "But are not the two beautifully blended in the case of Saul of Tarsus? He was possessed of a great degree of human knowledge, which, doubtless, united with God's wisdom, enabled him much better to expound the truths of God." "How could it, Mr. Newell, when the wisdom which he had learned at the feet of Gamaliel was perfectly con- tradictory to that he learned at the foot of the cross? He himself says that the 'wisdom of this world is foolish- ness.' He had to unlearn all his preconceived opinions when the true light revealed the lusts that were in his heart, and which, with all his boasted wisdom, he had never found out to be there."

Why did He choose Peter and others who, as the word says, 'were ignorant and unlearned men?'" "Doubtless because it was according to His own pleas- ure; but then you must acknowledge that Paul's mission was a far wider one than that of the other Apostles." "In one especial feature it was, I will acknowledge. To Paul alone, of all the Apostles, was it given to make known the mystery of the Church, which until then had not been revealed to either prophets or apostles. But the wisdom was not learned in the school of Gamaliel. His teachings would have scoffed at the very idea of Jew and Gentile being united in one body. And this, Mr. Newell, this very truth concerning the unity of the one body without schism, which Paul has so clearly brought out, although you would readily give him the highest place on account of his superior worldly wisdom, is the very thing which you are stumbling at! Consistency, remem- ber, is a jewel!" "Then you'd better go on further west, where the min- ister gets up with his linsey-woolsey on and boldly asserts his ignorance, and says that if God wants him 'to be edicated, he'll edicate him.'  A gush of laughter again accompanied the ludicrous expression, but she felt not in the least ruffled by his witticisms. "I have told you before, Mr. Newell, that I believe in mental culture as much as you or any one else," she an- swered. "All that I claim is, that the two kinds of wis- dom should not be confounded. Human wisdom can   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      403 never expound God's truth, because He says that 'the world by wisdom knows not God.' Is not that enough to settle the question, or do we need some human proof? And when the saints are assembled together, which the apostle admonishes them not to forsake, there the Holy Ghost is to be the only leader, and is Christ's servant to divide the truth to every one 'severally as He will--not as man will.' He may choose to use the weakest, most unlettered member of all that assembly to make known some precious truth, for God does not choose as man chooses. Had the selection been given to man, how very unsuited would Peter have appeared to fill the important place to which the Savior called him. But He sees that the sufficiency is all in Himself and not in man. The Holy Ghost has set all these different members in the Body-some apostles and prophets, others teachers, pas- tors, etc.-for the edifying of the saints and for the per- fecting of that Body; and He may use one or he may use another. But if any thing is revealed to one that sitteth by, the first is to hold his peace, for all may pro- phecy one by one." "Ho! ho! I understand you now! You mean Quaker meetings, and to speak when the Spirit moves you," shouted the minister, with another burst of merriment. "No; I am not a Quaker," she answered, " for that would be but a sect; and, as before shown, I see that already clearly forbidden in that ' Word which is for ever established in heaven.' But I hold to that truth which says that we should come as empty vessels only waiting to be filled."    <pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6632-00000203"/> 404     LINDEV -ILL O; iR, THE "Well, you would have a wonderful combination of things," he answered, with a look of visible displeasure upon his face. "Preaching was the understood order of things in the Apostles' day, and Paul preached without every ignorant layman having to comment upon it." "You don't understand my meaning," she replied. "It is when the Christian assembly meets to remember the Lord's death till he come which they are admonished not to forsake; that the Holy Ghost is to divide this truth to each. The preaching of the Gospe 1 is not ex- pected to be there, but outside. There were not many laymen present at Mars Hill, doubtless; and had there been Christian brethren present there or elsewhere, if the Spirit of God directed Paul's speech, as we are sure it did, there was nothing more needed to be said than the plain Gospel truths presented. This was not the place for edifying the saints or administering food to the body. This call was to persuade sinners to turn from darkness unto light, and of course the assembly had nothing to say to one's individual call, if called of God. I have nothing to say against preaching the Word, but rejoice to hear of its proclamation. Paul preached it and admonished Timothy to preach the Word, to be instant in season and out of season. Christ preached the glad tidings to the woman of Samaria at Jacob's well, and all through the Evangelists we find His faithful followers preaching that Word to sinners when and where they could get a list- ener. But this I do say, that the early Christians did naot meet upon the first day of the week for preaching, but Jar the breaking of bread. They were told that as often as   VANQ UISHED LIsE,-DREAM.     40  they partook of this feast of memorial they showed forth the Lord's death ' till He come.' And those Christians were commended for waitingfor God's Son from heaven; it was their daily longing and expectation, and, conse- quently, they met upon this day-the Lord's day-to show forth that death until His expected return. In the xx chapter of the Acts of the Apostles we read that upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came to- gether to break bread, Paul preached to them, but their object in coming together was not to hear Paul preach, but to break bread in remembrance of the death and expected return of the Lord Jesus. It is here, when meeting thus that the Holy Ghost is to divide the truth, using whom He will, as the xiv chapter of I Corinthians clearly shows. One with a psalm, another a doctrine, etc., that all may learn and all be comforted. Although the preaching of the Gospel is as evidently ordered of the Holy Ghost, it is not supposed that the saints are assembled at the preaching, for it is said, ' Go ye out and preach the Gospel to every creature; he that believeth shall be saved,' etc. Paul preached every Sabbath- the Jewish Sabbath, and not the Lord's Day--in the Synagogue, but it was to show the Jews that their zeal for God was not according to knowledge, that they were ignorant of God's righteousness in trying to establish their own. It is to the sinner and not to the saved that this Gospel is sent, although the Christian may listen to it with joyful heart; but it would be unreasonable to sup- pose that this chapter has any reference to interfering with the minister's work by ignorant laymen, as you term them."    <pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC6632-00000204"/> 406     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "I think myself that this breaking of bread every first day of the week is Scriptural," he assented after a short pause, " but I don't see the necessity of its being so rigidly adhered to." "And why not?" she asked. "Because it is a non-essential. There are other things of more vital importance." "How can you call this an unimportant thing, Mr. Newell?" she asked, earnestly. "Is it not a selfish feel- ing that would prompt us to do nothing only what would benefit ourselves? If this had not been in accordance with the wishes of the Lord, would he ever have request- ed it? The wife who does not long for her husband's return, and seek to do the things which he requested as a favor during his absence, is not to be commended. And shall the Bride of Christ deem it an unimportant thing to follow out the dying injunction of her heavenly Bridegroom, while rejoicing in anticipation of his quick return? The heart must be cold indeed which does not desire to remember it often." "O, I have no objections to offer against it," he ans- wered, candidly; "that is, to those who see proper to do so." "But that is not the thing to be considered," she re- plied. "' If ye love me, keep my commandments!' If it is right to commemorate this event at a-', is it right to deviate from the plain teachings of God's Word?" "I don't object to it myself, but I can't convince the world that this is the right thing, so I shall have to leave   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      407 it where it is," was the repetition of the world's compro- mising reply. "Then you acknowledge that this is according to God's record?" "I can't deny the fact," he answered. "And as a Christian you can go along against your convictions of what is right, just because the world does? There is no intermediate ground between right and wrong. Are you not participating in that which you acknowledge to be evil?" "I consider it a small matter," he answered, decided- ly; " it is not a saving ordinance, and, therefore, there is not any use in attaching so much importance to it."' "I can't see it in that light," was the serious rejoinder. "It is true that only persons who know themselves re- deemed by that precious blood are capable of entering into the real meaning of these emblems. But shall I consider the slightest word of Him who could call down legions of angels from the covert of the skies a matter of little importance?" There was a momentary silence, and both seemed intent upon their different thoughts; but at length he rallied, saying, "What is the use of us wasting so much valuable argument? If we are going into a regular de- bate, let's have an audience and speak from the pulpit." "O, but you see this same xiv chapter of Corinthians forbids that," she replied, laughing; and I believe that brings us to the last clause in your definition of a Church, "et your women keep silence m the Churches, for it is *    <pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC6632-00000205"/> 408     LINDEN HiLL;  OR, Y7HE not permitted unto them to speak; for it is a shame for women to speak in the Church.' " "The Corinthian believers," interposed Mr. Newell, "were in a low state, and, therefore, out of deference to womanly delicacy, they were commanded to keep silence." "But it says in all the Churches, or assemblies. It seems that the assembly at Corinth was not the only one in consideration-for ' it is a shame for woman to speak in the Church.'" O O, that is all folly," was the reply. "Did not Anna, the prophetess, minister in the temple continually?" "Certainly," she admitted; " but that was in the Jew- ish temple, before the Christian Church was ushered in, and the ministrations there were of an earthly nature--in sacrifices and offerings--and a very different thing from this." "Well, then, there was Phoebe, after the Christian dis- pensation came in, who was, doubtless, a deaconess, at least ' a succorer of many and of myself also,' Paul says, What do lyou say to that?" E( I say this," she answered, emphatically, "that she might have helped in the' serving of tables '-administer- ing to the individual necessities from the great family storehouse; but that would not license her to teach or preach in the assembly, contrary to the Apostle's com- mands. " "You appear to put but a poor estimate upon the capabilities of your own sex," he remarked. "It seems to me that the position you place woman in is not much   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      409 above that of the ancient heathen, who claimed that women had no souls." "I place woman in no position whatever, Mr. Newell," she responded. "I simply leave her in the very place where God has placed her, knowing that His infinite love would, never give her any position that was not for her good." "Well, I can't see any sense in such a theory as that,'" was the rejoinder. "I would consider it a curse to be a woman if that was to be my position." "Not when the husband is to love his wife even as Christ loved the Church. In the presence of such love- that would suffer every thing for her sake--could obedi- ence be an irksome task? 'The husband is the head of the wife,' and, therefore, is to be the medium through which she is to speak in the Church, and to me it seems beautifully arranged. It is not a thing to be wondered at that those who doubt the inspiration of the Bible should cavil at this seeming restriction placed upon woman, for how could they be expected to see beneath it all a'purpose of infinite love. But for those who pro- fess to believe it all, and who, by faith, are really God's children, and yet are not willing to acknowledge this plain statement of Scripture, is a matter not so easily understood." There was an awkward silence for a few moments, for Mr. Newell gave no answer to these remarks. ,His reason was convinced,-but his will was unshaken, and, as is usual in such cases, "' Convince a man against his will, He's of the same opinion still." 26    <pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC6632-00000206"/> 40 oI    LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "We had just as well discontinue this subject, Mrs. Howard," he at length remarked; '" we will never agree upon these things. I'm satisfied, and it is useless to proceed further. I am ready to admit that there is much reason in many things you say, but I believe that the providence of God has placed me where I am, and, under such circumstances, I have no right to leave it." "I believe, Mr. Newell, that a most remarkable provt- dence of God placed Moses in the courts of the Pharaoh's, but God's grace, when He saw that the position was a false one, enabled him to leave it." "That may be; but you are unyielding and-so am I, and talking will do no good." "If it is your wish to drop this matter, I am willing," she assented. "I don't want you to yield to my word, and neither will I to yours. But if you will show me, from God's Word, wherein I am wrong, I will yield to that, I'm sure." "Where is Freddie?" asked Mrs. Newell, who had just awakened from a protracted nap, and glided noise- lessly into the room. A"Enjoying himself finely with Bridget and the- boys," answered Mrs. Howard, bringing forward an easy chair. "He appears to be exceedingly well entertained with Bridget's comic stories." "I am glad of that," the mother replied; " but how have yourself and Mr. Newell managed with your argu- ment? Have you agreed to disagree?" "We have agreed to shake hands over the fence at   VA"NQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.   4i   1 last," smiled the minister. If we can't believe alike we can be friends anyhow." "You may reach over the fence," laughed Rena, " but I shall not acknowledge that there is any fence there. The sheep of Christ's flock are not put in separate folds."  But you see it separates us," he continued. "Yet'it should not, and the fence is all of human build- ing, for we nowhere read of such divisions in the rich pastures of His love; there is but one Shepherd and one fold." "Mrs. Howard, there always will be these differ- ences," he remarked gravely, " and there is no use in us ever expecting to see them disappear." "I know'that, but it does not lessen our individual responsibility," was the response. "If we can't change the course of the world, is it any reason that we should not mend our own ways when we see they are unscrip- tural.?"  "I do think that you ought to drop the subject en- -tirely," pleaded Mrs. Newell, considerately, for she was at heart a kind, considerate woman, but possessing an ,unusual vine-like nature. "Sister Howard looks really feverish over so much mental excitement, and I know it would kill me to undergo so much." "But thei you are such a weak, delicate little puss," responded the minister tenderly. "One would not ex- pect you to bear so much."

"I think that we had better call in a physician, Rena; this increasing weakness rather alarms me." "It is nothing, Philip," responded the wife, while a faint smile stole over her pale face. "It is only rest I need; I'm tired, tired! When I rest awhile I shall soon be well as ever." "I'm afraid not," he whispered, as he took the thin hand that rested upon the arm of the sofa in his own. "You have been resting now for a long time, and I see no improvement. "But I shall after awhile. Only think how much I have gone through, and my nervous system is so broken down. You need not expect me to get well in such a little while." "But you always say that whenever I speak to you about it," Philip answered, laughing. "And I guess I   VANQ UISHED - LIFE-DREA M.    413 shall have to send old Dr. Dean out here, when you don't think of it. You may expect to see his old brown gig hauling up in this direction any day." "Don't send him, Philip," she pleaded. "I know that rest is all I need. I don't want him to come; indeed I don't." And thus the days and weeks passed by, and Rena Howard's face gradually grew paler and her step more feeble,- but still she refused medical attendance, and term- ed her ailments as nothing but being " tired." And yet she did nothing that ought to tire her, for the simple act of walking across the room a few times was sufficient to produce those feelings of utter exhaustion. "Tut, tut, child!" chided gruff old Doctor Dean, as he held her emaciated hand in his. "This patch-work won't amount to anything. You may take stimulants that will make you feel all right for a time, but it won't last--it won't last. The truth is, your back was not broad enough for the burden you've had to carry. Your mind, too, as well as your body, has been too severely taxed, so that your nervous system has been broken down, and it will take something more than rest to get you up again.

"Don't let her get low-spirited, little one," he said, addressing the plump, black-eyed girl that was standing near. "She must keep up good heart and not be willful and do as she pleases, if she expects to get along. Y'ou must make her mind." "Do you 'spose mamma will mind Madge?" asked little Selton, with a look of the ludicrous about his -face. But the child was excusable for his ignorance of the world's ways. He did not know that the old-fashioned customs of parental authority had fallen into disrepute with the advancement of intelligence and morals, and was rapidly going out of use, and, therefore, thought that "mamma " was priviledged to do as she liked. "Madge could make Will Lee mind a great deal easier than she could mamma," remarked Phil, with a mischiev- ous twinkle in his eye. "He makes Madge think-- " "Phil, do hush," interrupted the blushing girl, at the same time stopping the boy's mouth with her chubby hand. ,c Let me tell it," he cried, struggling to extricate him- self.

"I'll promise not to tell it, if you'll get me a real nice knife that's so." "That boy's a brick," laughed the gruff old doctor, as he leaned back in his chair to enjoy their frolic. "He knows he's got her in close quarters, and is going to use his power. How early they begin to learn shrewdness." "That is very true," replied the mother, while an ex- pression of grieved tenderness hovered about her lips. '; The root of selfishness makes itself visible in actions very early." "O, fiddle! There's nothing wrong about that," re- sponded the straight-forward old fellow. "I like to see a boy learn how to take care of number one; it shows business." "It shows," answered the mother, "that the germ of every evil propensity is enfolded in the heart of the child, and only needs time and circumstances to expand, it." "I don't believe much in such stuff as that," was the brusque rejoinder. "I think it is outside circumstances more than inside propensities that prompt children to go astray. I see nothing in the action or reaction of the nerves, or in the expansion or contraction of the heart, to cause one to go in a wrong direction. Reason teaches it."

It is an injury to you, whether you believe it or not." "Why, Doctor? I don't think I reason at all," she answered gravely. "I used to cavil and reason a great deal, but now I receive things just as they are without reasoning anything at all about them. It was you thas was reasoning now; I simply stated facts." "You must not let her read so much, Mr. Howard," he remarked, turning to Philip, who sat listening to the con- versation with an indifferent indolence, while interests, and profits, and losses were even then perhaps uppermost in his mind. "Her mind will not bear much stimulus; she must quit reading and thinking so much-" "And living, too," chimed in the patient. "If you don't stop the first, you will soon enough quit that; so remember what I tell you, and mind me, too." And gathering up his trinkets he bade a crusty " good- day," and the old, brown sulky was soon rattling away on its mission to others who were in need of his profes- sional attendance. "He's a gruff old fellow," remarked Philip, after the doctor's simple vehicle had gone out of view. "I believe he understands your case, though, and if you will follow his directions they will benefit you."

She was thinking about the doctor's last caution, and was at as much of a loss to know how to understand what he required of her, and how a total cessation of thought would be brought about, as he had been puzzled with some of her " new-fangled " thoughts. "He ought to know best, Rena, and you must go ac- cording to his orders." "But I can't stop thinking, and, besides, the thoughts that my mind now dwell upon can not possibly harm me. I believe my principal ailment has been brought on by thinking--simply the plannings and projectings of an ambitious and visionary mind since early childhood. And since that one sweet life-dream has been vanquished and these plans all thwarted, although God has not taken them away without giving me something infinitely better before they went, and I have failed, it has simply left my mind without the stimulant that so long intoxicated my brain, and, of course, now, when duly sobered down, it leaves me weak and powerless." "I hope to goodness that you will not take the deli- rium tremens," remarked Philip, laughing. "I always had a horror of seeing people frightened with 'snakes in their boots,' and I don't want it to come so near home to me." "I don't see that such an occurrence would be impos- sible," she replied, soberly.

"I shall not argue the point with you," he replied. "Dr. Dean and yourself can settle that matter, if it is ot enough importance to discuss, without my help." "I don't ask you to," she remarked; " but still there is a great similarity between the two, whether Dr. Dean says so or not. Look at the persons whose lives have been characterized by excessive thinking and planning. I do not mean that it requires a superabundance of in- telligence to form an active mind. The half-idiot may have a very active mind-look at Coley Armstrong, for instance. But, of course, the greater the mind the wider the range that thought can take, and then stimulate it with ambitious desires and it is capable of accomplish- ing almost anything. It seems something like machinery to me. Put on plenty of steam and a diminutive engine will puff and blow away and wear itself out just as fast as the big one, but how infinitely much less its force will accomplish. This is evidently the cause of so much in- temperance among statesmen and politicians, and then it is all charged to intemperance." "A fear of delirium tremens makes you have a wonder- ful 'fellow-feeling' for intemperance, I see," interrupted Philip; "but I suppose it is but natural when a per- son comes to that pass."

"Well, then, I won't any more," he replied, breaking out in a fresh place. "I'll be good and stop laughing just as soon as I find a stopping place. "But really, Rena," he continued quite soberly, " you are not follow- ing the doctor's directions very well, I fear. These long harangues are only calculated to call out your mental faculties and make you worse. You must try and do as he tells you; invalids are not usually the most com- petent judges of what is best -for them." "O, I'll try to mind," was the simple rejoinder, as she leaned her head wearily upon his arm. "Life seems too delightful to me now to wish to shorten it, even though all is bright and fair beyond. Oh! how bright and blessed these last years of my life have been!" "I often think of that, too," responded Philip, as he smoothed down the soft tresses that fell in wild disorder about her shoulders. , I often think, when speculations fail and business grows dull and irksome, that I have something better left-even a cozy little home away from it all, where the radiant sunlight of happiness and peace forever shines!

Nothing is real or complete outside of Christ." "I believe it, Rena," he answered, thoughtfully, t" al- though I never did believe it until of late. When Paul Gretchen came to visit us I detested the very sight of him, and only because he told me these things were so. But of late something tells me that there is a reality about it all, and I can't feel the indifference I used to feel." "I know it, Philip," was the simple rejoinder. "My business does not seem to interest me as much as it used to, although my prospects were never brighter," he went on, in a straightforward manner. "It does not, however, seem to satisfy the insatiate thirst of my soul for something, and I don't know what myself." "He that believeth in Me shall never thirst," responded Rena. "I believe it is utterly impossible for a person to believe on Him unless God enables him to do so, and, if such is the case, what can any one do?" was answered. "Why, Philip, if I tell you any thing, you will believe it or not, just in proportion to your confidence in me. If it is something of importance, and through disbelief of my assertion you suffer loss, are not you yourself respon- sible?"

What (can a dead man believe or do?" "That is all true," she answered, "and the unconverted world is in that dreadful state. Look at those who are un- concerned about these things and see how they will tell you that they c are as good as any one,' or that C God is too merciful a Being to damn any one,' not realizing that God is a God of justice as well as mercy. They seem to be, and are, utterly unconscious of the state they oc- cupy-are truly dead to spiritual things. Take the man who is literally dead, and you may place any amount of weight upon his breast and what does he feel? Nothing. But suppose for a moment that actual life returned, and how would he writhe beneath his load? And whenever the sinner is really exercised before God, there is evidence of life. Of course there are often emotional feelings- the motions of human zeal or fleshly piety-which soon wear away after the excitement is over, and these will bring no fruit to perfection. But whenever the Spirit of God pierces the soul, the sinner begins to feel the weight of sin. This must be the beginning of spiritual life. God, by His Spirit, calls to the sinner, but he refuses to awake from this sleep of carnal security, and the devil is ever ready to stifle the voice of divine truth and 'catch away the seed sown.' The hearts of men 'choose dark- ness rather than light,' and thus the world goes on slum- bering, regardless of God's impending wrath.

"And 'faith is the gift of God.' So one can't get that until it is given to him; and if it is never given, who's to blame?" "If 'ye receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater,"' she answered, earnestly. "'And this is the witness that light is come into the world, and men choose darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil.' Here's the key to it all. The heart of man would rather believe the devil's lie than God's truth; and the only ob- stacle that prevents him receiving that faith is his own heart, which is at such bitter enmity against God. You hate Him and will not believe His word." "You are mistaken, Rena," he answered, candidly. "I used to feel that if God was a Being of love, He would never have permitted man to fall in sin when he could have prevented it so easily. I looked at Him as a hard, unfeeling God, and appreciated Him accordingly. And sometimes such thoughts will rise in my heart even now. I believe then, if I could have analyzed my own feelings, that I really hated God. But I do not now. I see now that man has caused all the ruin, and that God, although man has so grossly misrepresented His character, is still ready to forgive." "That is what the word terms 'repentance toward God,' but it does not include 'faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.'" "It can't be that, if repentance is what I always thought it was," he replied. "I always took repentance   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      423 to be a deep sorrow for sin, which I cannot say that I feel. I could not see in the past that I was doing any thing wrong, or was in myself any thing wrong. I was morally blind, and now it is not so much what I have done as what I am, that I see needs to be remedied. What would be the use for me to grieve over my past sins when, if they were all washed away, and my nature unchanged, I would only go right on to do the same again?" "That is so, Philip, and I'm glad you see it thus," re- sponded Rena, while a tear-drop as a crystal thank-offer- ing was visible in her eye. "Such knowledge can come only from above, for this world's wisdom will never re- veal to man his nothingness and moral degradation. And this is 'repentance toward God,' in its true sense; for repentance might truly be termed a 'change of mind.' If you have been at enmity with an individual, you do not repent of the wrong you have done him while your heart is still filled with bitterness toward him. But when you honestly consider the matter and see that you were altogether in fault, your mind will be changed, and you will feel sorry for having wronged a friend. And it is even so when a ray of divine light is once permitted to penetrate the soul; it reveals the sinner's waywardness and rebellion and God's faithfulness and tender mercies, which can do nothing less than-humble the penitent be- fore Himself." "And do you believe that one can do anything toward obtaining that faith by which he is delivered from sin and born of God?" he asked.    <pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC6632-00000213"/> 424     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE '"Not for a moment," she answered, promptly; 4" but he can at least stop fighting against it; and the moment he does that--resisting God no longer-that moment the hand of deliverance is stretched forth and he is saved! Man's own will is all that debars him from salvation. This very point, I fully believe, is where the salvation of the infant dying in infancy is met. Its will has not yet expanded and grown into rebellion against God, and therefore does not reject the love that suffered all things to save sinners. 'Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life.' " "Well, it all seems so mystified to me, anyhow," re- marked Philip, straightening himself upon the sofa pre- paratory to taking his accustomed nap. "And the more I think about it the more jumbled up it seems. I wish I could forget all about it, but I can't." "Why, Philip, if you were standing upon the verge of a precipice, with an avalanche above you ready to de- scend at any moment, would you try to forget it?" asked Rena, earnestly. "And this is just the place the sinner occupies, whether he knows it or not. He is standing blindfolded upon the verge of an endless eternity, not knowing what moment the vast weight of God's wrath against sin may descend upon him, sinking him down, down, and that forever/ O, if they would only believe it!" Philip said nothing, for although these truths seemed so clear to her, he was yet not able to enter into their full depths. He was passing through that twilight scene -something of which every quickened soul has known-   VAN4QUSHED LIFE-DREAM.      425 just before the sunlight of divine truth has fully illumed their understanding. He must wait until his eyes were anointed to behold these things, and till the 'day-star from on high should arise in his heart.' Rena leaned back in her chair and softly chanted a few snatches of some old familiar melodies, and Philip was soon lost in the land of shadows. For sleep was Philip's soothing cordial in times of trouble, and his troubles were never so great but what he could beckon slumber to his aid. She was now weak and nervous, but inexpressibly happy under it all. And yet we may readily suppose that with a will so strong, so unyielding as her own, she had daily conflicts to encounter with the old Adam na- ture. But she was learning not to trust herself, knowing that there was nothing but evil there! Madge smiled at some childish thought, as she bent over her embroidery work, and then " hem'd and haw'd " to conceal the smile when she saw that Mrs. Howard's eye rested upon her. "You must have very entertaining thoughts, Madge," she remarked, laughing. "Why not give the rest of us the benefit of them if they are so very amusing?" A blush suffused the face of the girl as she answered: "O, it's nothing but nonsense. You would not want to hear it." "I expected it was that," answered Rena; " but if it is laughable, let us all have the benefit of a good, hearty laugh." "I   would not tell you for a York-pence," replied 27    <pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC6632-00000214"/> 426     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE Madge, folding up her work and preparing to beat a retreat. "York-pence-yes, I know now," shouted Phil, exult- ingly. "That's the kind of money that Tom Dill is so flush with; easy coined, too; just the sort to suit him. I don't wonder, though, that the poor fellow should in- dulge in that kind of wealth when he has so little of any other kind." "What do you mean, Phil," asked his mother, as Madge shook her finger at him in a defiant manner. O, nothing, only what Tom Dill said to Madge as they went to the picnic. Isn't that so, Madge?" But Madge was up and gone; and as Phil had been pledged to secrecy when initiated as her confidante, he could then tell nothing more to try and tease her.   A4NQ&amp;ISHED LIFE DREAM.       437 CHAPTER XXXI. PAUL GRETCHEN. "The 'peace of God' possessed his soul, His word was both his meat and drink; On Christ he did his troubles roll, And knew He ne'er would let him sink!" "Come to tell us good-bye?" reiterated Mrs. Howard, with astonishment, as she seated herself in an easy chair close by. "O, we don't want you to go away again so soon, Mr. Gretchen. You must not." "It seems to be the mind of the Lord that I should," responded the visitor, as he took the proffered chair and  went on conversing in an easy, graceful manner. "And I desire to have no will of my own in this matter, but to be entirely subject to the will of my Master." " But we will miss you so much," continued Rena, pleadingly. "Your stay has been so very short." Paul Gretchen only smiled one of those gentle, expres- sive smiles, for he was one of those whose lives are wholly given up to God; and however much he might appreciate earthly loves or friendships, through grace he was enabled to pass them by, and go on in his high and  holy calling.    <pb n="428-429" xml:id="VAC6632-00000215"/> 428     LINDEN rILL; OR, T'HE {"Do you go immediately home from this place?" asked Philip, after a momentary silence. "My dear friend, this spot is as much my home as any the world offers," answered the visitor, pleasantly. "I go wherever God sends me to preach His word, looking to Him alone for food and shelter, and He never fails to give it." "But I had supposed that you usually made your stop- ping place among relatives," continued Philip, " and that you were now going there." "No oftener there than to other places," he continued, in an abstracted manner. "I am to know no one after the flesh, however pleasant it may be to be with those allied to us by the ties of nature. I expect to go from here to the places where I have labored in years past." *"Not among those wretched Indians again, Mr. Gret- chen?"Mr. Howard ejaculated, with- amazement. "Surely you are not going there?" "That is where God is leading me," was the quiet answer. "It is a place the flesh does not covet, but there are poor, benighted souls there who are perishing for want of the bread of life. I must go to them." "But is their manner of life such that you can endure to live among them?" was queried. "All that I have ever been among are very filthy." "They are intolerably so," responded Mr. Gretchen. "But I fix me up a shanty of my own and do my own work, so you see I get along quite well. My cabin is not very elegant, but in summer time there is a good cir- culation of air, as you could run your arm out through   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      429 the cracks, and you know that is healthy. In the winter- and those winters are very severe-with some patching up and two stoves I manage to live quite comfortably." "I should think it would be a very lonely life," re- marked Mrs. Howard, thoughtfully. "It is in one sense, but then I realize the presence of Him who has said, ' I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.'" "Are you ever subjected to insult or abuse from these people?" asked Philip, knowing full well the treacherous nature that belongs to this unsettled and, doubtless, much wronged race. "O, sometimes," he answered, smiling. "I have some- times had clods, almost as hard as lead, thrown from the beaten highway at me, but have never been seriously harmed. At other times they have lain in ambush near the dark, deep forest path, that they might waylay and beat me, simply for preaching Christ, but my Father always delivered me, and I know that he always will, if it is not best that I should be delivered into their hands." Philip Howard said nothing, but he could not under- stand the faith that could unflinchingly bear such insults and brave such dangers. He was himself a stranger to fear, but his reliance was upon his own manly strength and courage, while his newly' mde friend was ready to acknowledge his own weakness and lack of tact, and simply trusted himself in the hands of God. "But I cannot deny that this is really a life of trial and privation," continued Mr. Gretchen. "How many, many times have I gone for miles through the dark, deep    <pb n="430-431" xml:id="VAC6632-00000216"/> 430     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE woods to the place where the friendly ones had made arrangements for me to preach to them, and when I reached the place, found that, for some reason of their own, they had moved the place of meeting some miles further away, making it a much more circuitous route to go, and, as far as outward circumstances were con- cerned, the prospect of reaching the hearts of those be- nighted ones was anything but flattering. A logfire, burn- ing in the centre of an Indian hut, with a hole cut in the top for the smoke to escape, were their only conveniences. We had no cushioned pews, nor well-practiced choirs among us. The Indians would be all seated around the fire upon the ground, in Turkish style, while, by the dim light pf the fire, and through an interpreter, I addressed them. I often felt that if there was one spark of divine truth kindled in a heart present, the Spirit of God alone must do the work, for there was nothing outwardly to help it on. And I have had abundant reason to thank and praise Him that He did do the work, using me merely as an instrument in His hand to accomplish it." "Would you stay all night with them then?" was queried, after a short pause, and while the visitor still seemed lost in the quiet contemplation of those scenes through which he had passed. "No, indeed," he responded, arousing himself from his silent reverie; " they were too intolerably filthy for that. I always returned after meeting to my shanty. Often it was nearly morning before I got back, and I would drag my weary limbs along the forest path, feeling nearly too much fatigued to go; and sometimes I would sit down   VA NQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      43  upon a log by the wayside to rest, not knowing what moment an enemy might assail me; and thus I went along, from time to time, and God never for a moment forgot me, however unfaithful I might have been to Him." "And were you enabled to see any good results from your labors?" asked Mrs. Howard, anxiously. "Yes, indeed," he answered, joyfully. "God can work where circumstances are most unpropitious. Be- fore I left, there was quite a number there happily con- verted and walking m communion and fellowship with the Lord. There were a few among them who were really gifted in teaching, and some in preaching the Word, so I felt that I could leave them for a time and go elsewhere." "And do those people see that your wants are all sup- plied?" asked Philip, " or do you have to look else- where for resources " "I never look or rely upon man for anything," he answered promptly. "If I looked to man for either food or raiment, I should expect to have to preach some- thing that would please man, and God's simple, unvar- nished truth will never do that. But then it really takes but little to do man here." "Yes, but if he is even content withfood and raiment, that will be needful and must come from some source." "And it always will," he replied, in the same quiet tone. "If men called me to preach, these needful things might fail if I did not preach that which suited their    <pb n="432-433" xml:id="VAC6632-00000217"/> 432     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE views, but since God has called and sent me forth He will supply all my actual wants." "But, of course, He must have some medium through which to act," she continued, not exactly understanding the force of his remark. "That I leave entirely with Himself," he again replied, "I am working for Him and I know He will supply my needs. It may come through savage or through civilized hands, or I might think I needed things which did not come at all; but He knows what I really need. And now, if I had no shoes upon my feet, I could not say that my needs were-not supplied, for it would, doubtless, be best that I should be thus destitute, for reasons best known to Himself. He is the giver; it is for me to trust Him." "Will you accept this as the gift of a friend?" said Philip, extending a bank note; "it may be found useful in some trying hour." "No! thank you," he replied, shaking his head em- phatically. "Give yourself first to the Lord, and then you can do acceptable work for Him. You can't work until you get into the vineyard; the sinner's highway will bring forth no fruit." "But I simply offer it to yourself, not expecting any reward," remarked Philip, somewhat taken aback at the refusal of his kind offer. "And I fully appreciate your kind intentions, Philip Howard, and thank you sincerely for it," he replied; "but remember that I am not my own; I have been bought with a price. The Savior said that whosoever   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      433 giveth unto one of these giveth unto Me. Can I receive a gift, as from the hands of my Master, from one who disregards the record of .God's love-nay, who is even making God Himself A LIAR in disbelieving it?" "I never thought of that before," remarked Mrs. How- ard; " and yet we read of the Centurion, who was highly applauded by the Jews for his worthiness because he had built them a synagogue, and we don't know that he was a Christian." "He was not, in the sense that the Christian now stands," answered Mr: Gretchen, opening his Bible. "The Holy Ghost did not then dwell in the believer, for Christ was not yet glorified and believers were not yet all baptized into one body. But this Centurion was a believer in Christ nevertheless, for He says,'I have not found so great faith; no, not in Israel." "And you think that God does not accept gifts, how- ever sincerely given, from those who are yet in the world?" asked Philip, somewhat bitterly, for this home- thrust had again stirred up the animosity in his heart, which he ignorantly supposed had ceased to exist there. "God's word will warrant me in believing nothing else," he responded calmly. The example of Cain and Abel, "he continued, hastily turning to the portion of the volume indicated," is very conclusive evidence, if the word contained nothing more upon the subject. Abel, by faith, saw that a slain victim alone could appease the wrath of God, while Cain came to offer the fruits of a sin-cursed earth. He may have worked very hard to cause the earth to produce this fruit, and it may have ap-    <pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC6632-00000218"/> 434     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE peared exceedingly beautiful to the eyes of nature, but it was not what God required. He was presenting the work of his own hands, just as you were going to do now. ' Without faith it is impossible to please Him,' and the heart, by nature, has no faith in God. The heart, if it fully believed the wondrous love which His word re- veals, would not hestate to trust Him fully, and you well know that you would trust your own manly strength, your own skill, in short, anything before you would trust God." "They both remained silent for a short time, and only the loud ticking of the clock upon the mantel shelf broke the silence. His words had been plain and pointed, but Philip Howard's conscience could not deny that the im- plication was strictly true. "If there are natives among your Indians who are suitably gifted to look after the assembly, I don't see why you could not stay lorger," remarked Rena, returning-to her old charge. "There are sinners enough here who need to be told of God's glad tidings, I'm sure." "Because He sends me elsewhere," was the simple response; "and those ignorant sons of the forest are more ready to receive the truth, when once their preju- dices are overcome, than those who are more fully devel- oped mentally. Alas! there is nothing by nature in man that will bear development! There is nothing but evil in his nature, enmity against God; ' for the carnal mind is enmity against God, not subject to His law, neither- indeed can be. so they that are in the flesh cannot please God.' As a natural consequence, the more culture, with-   YANQUISHED LIFE-DR EAM.      435 out God's grace, the more avenues for spreading itself this evil will assume. It may be more genteel and ac- complished, more polished and refined, but the fruit grows upon the same old Adam stock, and we know that except the tree be lopped off and a good tree grafted in, all the fruits must ever partake of the nature of their old parent stem. But I am tresspassing upon my allotted time," he remarked abruptly, looking at his watch. "I have another call to make before train time, which, I see, will have to be very short." "We are sorry to have you go," remarked Philip, " but may we not expect your return soon?" "I have no plans," he answered in the same low, gen- tle tone; " my way is directed by Another. If God re- veals His will concerning me to-day, it is enough without seeking to find out what it will be in time to come." "Good-bye!" he articulated with a smile, as he took Mrs. Howard's hand. "If we never meet in these low grounds again, it will not be long until we meet in the clouds-even all His redeemed ones; and there will be no partings there!" A tear dimmed her eyelas she turned away, a regret at parting with one so much beloved, but his face wore the same serene expression that characterized his daily life. His whole self was too fully yielded up to Christ as a living sacrifice, too wholly bent upon doing His will to permit earthly friendships or any earthly things to impede his steps. "And you," he continued, turning to Philip, with a look of tenderest love, " can you not yield yourself up to    <pb n="436-437" xml:id="VAC6632-00000219"/> 436     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE the Lord? I will not ask you, as I once did, ' Where art thou?' for I think that the Spirit of God has taught you that you are lost. But can't you now, as Adam did when he heard the voice of the Lord God calling him, acknowledge that you are afraid, because unclothed with the garment of salvation. Accept the garment that His grace has prepared and rejoice in a full, a complete deliv- erance." The listener clasped his hand in a warm, loving clasp, but said nothing. "God bless you, my dear, dear friend," he added, with a lingering look of tenderness, and, in another instant, he was gone. Gone again into his self-imposed exile, where not a tie of nature could twine their tendrils around his lonely life! Gone where the soft, sweet voice of mother, wife or sister could never come between himself and the one fixed purpose of his soul, nor draw him away from his high and holy mission! He had gone forth 'bearing precious seed,' perhaps ofttimes weeping over the groan- ing slaves of Satan's Egypt as he longed to show them the way of deliverance; but there is a day soon coming when he will return to Him who sent him forth, rejoicing with the sheaves that his faithfulness has garnered! "How lonely such a life must be," remarked Mr. Howard, as Paul Gretchen's fleet footsteps carried him out of view. "He seems quite joyous over it," was the reply. "There is never a shade of sadness visible upon his face." "A man must have an unusual degree of faith when he can give up every thing in such a manner, and that   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      437 without even knowing where his daily support is to come from." "It seems to me," continued Rena, "thatif one can trust God in the greatest of all matters, he ought to be able to trust Him for such little things as food and rai- ment." "But it is so contrary to nature," he insisted. "I know it, and it is so much easier to imagine that we could do a thing of that kind than to really walk through it with confidence when put to the test. If there is the least show for human help, we are always ready to trust in that instead of trusting in God. I have felt this often and often myself." "And do you think that you have risen completely above it?" asked Philip. "I can trust Him as a Protector," she answered frank- ly; " but faith only comes by degrees-it has to grow. Perhaps I should have to undergo some very deep trials before I could learn to trust Him for every thing, as Paul Gretchen does, even if I ever learned to trust that fully." "It is truly wonderful to see how such a faith will affect the life of an individual. The very expression of Paul Gretchen's face shows that he lives in an atmos- phere far above the jars and discords of this world." "Then if such a radiance can adorn one's face who is simply walking with the Savior down here, what must it be to look upon that spotless One Himself? The Chris- tian's light is all a borrowed light, as was that of Moses when his face shone from being only in the presence of God upon the mount. But I do believe that, as a gen-    <pb n="438-439" xml:id="VAC6632-00000220"/> 438     LINDEN HiLL; OR, 7HE eral thing, take the whole life through, the face is a pretty fair index of the heart. There may be exceptions, and there may be hours of apparent light-heartedness which are extravagant but perfectly unreal, but these will soon relapse into sadness again." "Then what do you think of Deacon Brown, who considers it the very cream of religion to be bathed in tears?" "I think he may be a Christian, but his tears would not indicate that he was a very happy one. There is some reservation in his heart which he is not willing to give up, or he is still under the law in sentiment, and consequently, knows no perfect deliverance. Why, the Christian ought to be the happiest man on earth, for he has God's promise that he shall be supplied with all need- ful temporal blessings, as well as an assurance of infinite blessedness in the world to come. And what do you want?" she asked, addressing Phil, who had been for some time pulling at her sleeve. "Dick True wants to ride Gipsy down- the hill and back again; may we go?" ' I wonder if Phil Howard is not equally implicated in the desire!" responded the mother, laughing. "Go and get you a stick horse, Phil," said Mr. How- ard, seriously. "They can't be hurt by excessive riding, and then you-can have a horse a-piece." "Ugh!" responded Phil, in a disdainful manner, for the possession of a real, live pony had somewhat advanced his ideas in regard to his own developed manhood, and   PANQUISHED LIFE DREAM.      439 the time seemed long distant when he indulged in such childish pastimes. "Ugh! What?" queried the father gravely. "Isn't it good enough for you? When I was your age I ex- pected nothing better, and was proud as a prince in the possession of such." "You surely valued the name of riding then," remarked the child honestly. "I'm sure if I had to ride a stick horse, and did not ride just for the name of it, I'd rather walk. But may we go?" A I don't care," responded Philip, as he turned away that he might not betray his own weakness in laughing at the boy's simple expression, and in another instant the children had all left the room and were exultantly laugh- ing and yelping about the barn. "The aspirations of childhood are not generally far-reaching," he remarked, listening to the commingled voices of the little assembly, as they were arranging their various plans of who should ride second, &amp;c.- Of course, it was understood that Dick was to ride first, as he was the visitor. "But even if they do have their little ' ups and downs,' they seem happy in their childish way." "And might be fully as happy all through life, if they would only accept of everything with the same child- like thankfulness," responded Mrs. Howard. "Man   f often knocks the cup of happiness out of his own hand, simply because its contents don't look bright enough to suit his selfish fancy."    <pb n="440-441" xml:id="VAC6632-00000221"/> "O       LINDEN HILL; OR, THE CHAPTER XXXII.

The long, lazy months of summer had passed away and autumn reigned, decked with a crown of varied hues. The summer flowers had lived out their brief days of loveliness, and were now gone from the yards and mead- ows that were already beginning to wear a brown and uninviting look.

Rena Howard sat in her easy chair upon the little portico, around which the Virgin Bower and Queen of the Prairie' had lately formed an emerald curtain of. surpassing loveliness. But their leaves were crisp and yellow now, and the fragrant honey suckle and climb- ing jassamine leaned in their unclothed, pitiable con- dition against the house-wall, so bare and destitute, just at the season of the year when it would seem they most needed a dress to protect them from the chilly northern blasts. But does it ever get too sultry or too chilly for love and romance? Mrs. Howard's eyes would involun- tarily wander at intervals from the stately old trees, the falling leaves, and the dark, portentous clouds that were beginning to loom up in the western horizon, to rest upon a truant pair who were occupying a rustic seat beneath the trees; but they were utterly unconscious that the heat was not actually great enough to drive them to the shade. The sun was just sinking behind the bank ot dark, Jcold- looking clouds, but before being entirely hidden from their view it sent a ray of golden sunlight over field and woodland, as if loth to part with so much that was beau- tiful even yet in nature. "Poor, little Madge! She is a wild, a wayward girl, and yet she is very kind," soliloquized the invalid, as the girl's jocund laugh rang out clear and musical upon the evening air. "She has really been like a sunbeam to me during these long days of illness." She leaned back wearily, while her nervous fingers   VANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      443 clutched the decaying leaves from the vines that clustered around and above her, and then breaking them into numerous little atoms, tossed them away to the mercy of the evening breeze. She felt so tired, so utterly exhausted, and yet she had done nothing but watch the clouds and trees, or listen to the sheep bleating upon the brown pas- tures and the herd lowing along their homeward track. "All alone?" smiled Philip, as he sauntered leisurely up the walk and seated himself upon the step. "But this won't do," he continued, rising abruptly and going into the house. "You must be better protected from the chilly air than this, for you look like a faded lily, any how." She sniiled as she drew the warm wraps more closely around her wasted form, saying, "Faded lilies always look world-weary to me, and I'm sure I don't look so." "No; but you shiver and look faded. But perhaps you could better be compared to a frightened little bird, that flutters around when it hears the bleak winds of autumn blowing," hM continued, laughing. "But I will soon take you away to some brighter and less merci- less region, and try to bring back the roses to your cheeks once more." "It may bring back a tinge of health," was the cheer- ful response; "Cbut remember that it can never bring back the freshness of youth, nor conceal the furrowed lines of care and silvery hairs that already are so strik- ingly visible."

"You don't possess one charm less, according to my estimate, because the bloom of life's springtime has faded. The fruits of autumn are not less beautiful than the flowers of spring." "Isn't it growing colder?" she asked, with a shudder, as the wind gave the vines amore vigorous shake than it had heretofore indulged in. "Let us go in, Philip. I think we will find it far more comfortable in-doors, if not so romantic as sitting beneath an arch of clinging vines. I wonder if Madge has thought about it being cold?" "I doubt it," replied Philip, as he threw himself upon a settee to while away the evening hour. "They don't know whether it's August or November." "The season is so far advanced that we will not have much time to loiter," she remarked drawing nearer the cheerful fire that had just been kindled upon the hearth. "I shall have to make a few hasty visits, and follow the birds in their southern flight." "And where do you want to go first?" he asked, in a bantering tone. "Shall I drive you out to see Mrs. Dale to-morrow?" "Oh, dear, no! Why she'd bore me to death telling about the wonderful precocity of that paragon of a baby of her's." "And I'm sure you ought to be glad that she appre- ciates her blessings so much," answered Philip. "But I'm at your service; just choose your course, and I'll go according to orders." "Take me down to the little graveyard, Philip, where   VANQUISHED LIFE DREAM.      445 my mother and our baby sleep. I feel that I can readily find companionship down there!" "Why, Rena, I thought you did not believe in hover- ing over those dark, dreary places now," responded the husband, thoughtfully. "You must not get low-spirited if you expect to get well soon." "I shall not go there with the feelings I used to have; don't fear that," was the cheerful reply. "I know full well that 'that they are not there, but risen;' but some- how I feel that to revisit those old haunts would be like finding an old landmark, showing where I was and to what distance God has brought me.' , "Mamma, aren't I your 'diamond in the rough?' " shouted little Selton, interrupting their conversation as he burst wildly into the the room, with cheeks all aglow with health and contact with the sharp autumn winds. "Of course; I value you as such," she answered, quietly. "But why do you ask?" "Because Phil says its all nonsense, and I'm not, and I know I am," was the emphatic rejoinder, for Seltie never wanted stronger proof of anything than to know himself that it was so. "And shan't I go with Phil fish- ing when we go South?" he continued, wishing to settle the entire catalogue of difficulties and get themi off his hands. "Phil says I can't, and that I'm too little to climb orange trees and gather down the oranges, and-" "Won't he allow you to help catch alligators either?" interrupted Philip, seeing that the child was almost out of breath relating his many grievances. Seltie was apt to lose all his heroism when the alliga-    <pb n="446-447" xml:id="VAC6632-00000224"/> "6     LINDEN HILL; GR, THE tor tribe was mentioned, and to draw somewhat closer to his mother, feeling that even at that' moment the dis- tended jaws of that dreaded monster might be ready to gobble him up. He put on a bold front, however, say- ing : "You can't scare me about them now. I don't want them, though, for mamma says they're nasty, ugly things. But I'm going to gather oranges, and Phil can't keep me from it. Now, there goes Phil on Gipsy," he broke off, abruptly, and hastened away as the brother passed the door on his tiny, white horse, its long, flowing mane car- ried out by the strong evening breeze. The shadows were extending far toward the East when Rena Howard, with faltering step, entered the quiet cemetery, leaning upon her husband's arm. It was a silent, solemn spot, and that fragile one looked as though she might soon sleep beside parents and child in that lone retreat, undisturbed by the world's busy turmoil without. But there was no look of sadness upon her face, for, to her, the darkness of death was passed, and passed forever. In a few days she expected to go away from her rural home to avoid the severity of a north- ern winter. Perhaps she might be left to sleep in the everglades of that sunny region, where the birds sing the whole year round and where the perfume of tropical flowers forever floats upon the gentle breeze. Dr. Dean had said, "Take her away from  here; a change is needful, and it will do her more good than medicine." "But she is not reaily well enough to go," responded   VANQUISHED LIEE-DREAM.       447 Mr. Howard, thoughtfully. "She must be too weak for such a journey." "( Then take her on a bed," replied the gruff old fellow. "And mind, don't you go away and leave her again." And so it had been settled that she should go away to the , Sunny South," to pass the winter, and then again return to her northern home. - If she fell asleep there, that sleep was not clothed in the horrid garb of death, it was only a quiet, peaceful slumber. Come life or death, her peace was changeless and eternal, and '( E'en the dews of sorrow Seemed lustred with His love." It was all peace, all joy, and that forever. ,We'll, this looks like the same old familiar place where I used to come so often 'long time ago!'" she murmured, seating herself upon a grassy knoll close by her father's and mother's graves. There was nothing more grand and imposing than two plain white marble slabs to mark their rest! They wished no more. But then their unparaded virtues had reared for them in many a heart a monument, ere they laid down the burden of life to sleep in their narrow homes. On one white stone was inscribed "Justin Selton, aged 8I," and "Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord." Upon the other, "Dollie, wife of Justin Selton, aged 68," and beneath, the words that had so often proved precious to her soul, "I know that nmy Redeemer iveth."  This, in-    <pb n="448-449" xml:id="VAC6632-00000225"/> "8     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE eluding the dates of death, etc., was all, and. this was, or should be, enough, for ("The monumental stone we raise; Is to the Savior's not the sinner's praise." "How often I used to come here at the twilight hour, all alone, to visit my mother's grave," she continued, dreamily. "It was the dearest, and yet the saddest, spot on earth to me, unless I except the sadness of that desolate home up there after she was gone. It seems weak and childish, now I think of it, and yet I could not help it. I have talked to her here as I would talk to you now, and have even knelt beside her grave and asked God to give me a brighter realization of her blessed pres- ence. Don't laugh at my folly, Philip; I know that it only showed my weakness, for I was really looking to the creature instead of the Creator for comfort. But God alone knows what deep anguish I endured in that time. It seemed as though all the light of earth went out when my mother died, and it was enough to darken every thing. Is there any thing belonging to earth so pure, so unselfish as a mother's love?" "And do you think it is superior to the love of hus- band and wife?" "The husband and wife are one, Philip.  It is more like loving yourself to love your wife, and, conse- quently, must comprise more of selfishness than the other. I know that conjugal love is deepest, and that the break- ing of it, when what it should be, would be like ' divid- ing asunder soul and spirit.' And I believe there are-- \,                 .."    VA NQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      449 differences in the depth of mother-love, but when I look back at my own mother's, it seems like something too high, too holy for earth-something that must be akin to heaven." "I wonder what became of that tree we planted here?" remarked the husband, in order to change the wild cur- rent of her thoughts. Her eye was unusually bright, for the retrospective glance over the past had called up all the deeper feelings of her soul, and yet he found that such intens'e excitement was too much for the little strength her frail nature now held in possession. Should the wasted bodily energies be sacrificed to the momentary blaze of a mental excitement? "Oh! it's gone long ago," she replied, moving with her pale hand the long grass from the well remembered spot. "I tried hard to make it live, but, like every thing else belonging to my life in those days, it seemed shad- owed with disappointment and death, and so it withered away in spite of all my efforts. I could not. help feeling that- the death of that tree was an evil omen." i' I thought you did not believe in omens," was the re- ply. You said it was a superstitious notion that ought to belong to a darker age." ' Of course I don't believe in them now, and would not then have acknowledged that I believed in such things, but still I was always ready to take refuge under every shadow that crossed my way. But it is all over now, and I no longer sit in-the shadow of those clouds which my own selfishness helped to gather. I made my own troubles, but I've now given up the trade." ?.    <pb n="450-451" xml:id="VAC6632-00000226"/> 450     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE "And what trade do you propose to follow now-that of making home sunshine?" "I'm afraid I make but little of that," she responded; "but I'm ready to revel in the sunlight others make. But my chief happiness outside the joys which flow from a knowledge of my Savior's love is in being perfectly content with who I am and what I am. This has enabled me to give up the one deep, darling dream of my life, which only fed the fires of ambition, and rendered my life so miserable. I know that my Father's love is too real a thing to deny me anything if it was not for the best; so I accept my lot with thankfulness and rise above my cloudy covert!" "I thought you believed the Christian retained the same nature as before," remarked Mr. Howard. "How then, if you were so completely infatuated with your am- bitious dreams, could you give them up and still have the same nature?" "Would I strive to procure a pebble, when I had found a pearl?" she asked. ("The pebble looked pure enough before I saw anything better, although it alwa)ys kept me wading through deep waters in pursuit of it. It is not that those dreams are rooted out of my heart, but they are eclipsed by brighter ones." There were no words spoken for a few moments, and they sat in meditative silence in this " city of the dead." Philip cut some of the long, smooth hazel switches that grew so profusely around them in many parts of that quiet place, for many slept there who had no friends to watch over their silent slumbers. He carefully removed   YANQUISHED LIFE-DREAM.      451  the fading leaves from their parent stem and laid them at his side. Ah! there was no need of the rod among that lowly company. The last stroke was given ere they were borne in sorrow to that place! "I can never feel like that place belongs to strangers," she at length broke the silence by saying, as she pointed to where the old homestead stood upon the hill. "They may hold deeds and titles of possession, but upon the re- cords of imagination it is mine--still mine! And when I open this book of remembrance, I can find every haunt laid down and clearly described on its pages, and there are no mortgages nor deeds of trust upon it to dispute my perfect right." "I don't see what you would want with the old 'tum- ble-down,' even if you had a perfect title to it," Philip responded, indifferently. "It is not to be compared with our own bright Linden Hill.". And there is no wonder that he felt almost inclined to ridicule her excessive weak- ness, for the walls had grown more dingy and dilapidated through the lapse of time, although to Rena Howard they possessed a beauty beneath the mould and decay which, with the best of spectacles, another could never discern. Therestood the old barn, the Eden of childish happiness, where she had so often romped upon the fresh, green hay, or gathered her bonnet full of eggs from the well-stored loft. But the doors were off their hinges now, and great weeds had grown rankly about the paths, the only things that seemed untouched by decay, and had almost seemed to defy the ravages of an approaching winter. But then there was the old orchard yet, that    <pb n="452-453" xml:id="VAC6632-00000227"/> 452     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE shadowy haunt where she had coined many a golden thought! Ah! but very many of those trees, which had for so many years defied the force of time, had fallen beneath the weight of the winds that swept so ruthlessly among their branches. "There was a hollow tree where the blue birds used to build their nests," she said, pointing to the place. "I used to go there and peep in at their little eggs and after- ward take out the little birds, just to love them a little while, for I was always tender with them. But I shall not easily forget how I was frightened one day when Bessie and I went, as usual, to see our pets. We were both eager to get the birdlings first, and so without wait- ing to look in as usual, I thrust my hand into the nest. But JI drew back with a shudder as my fingers came in contact with something cold! It was a loathsome black- snake, that had devoured the little nestlings, and then had coiled himself up contentedly in the nest. Listen! I hear a bird singing even now among the boughs. It is not one of the birds I used to hear, but doubtless related to them, and so I like it for their sakes." She seemed to have retraced her steps and gone back to the years of childhood, as she reviewed each well- known haunt. Every place was so familiar! She could almost see her mother's footprints about the door and around the old well-curb, and recognize her father's well- remembered step as he hastened out to attend to his evening chores! "They may call it theirs if they like," she murmured, "but never from a real possession can they garner such *    VANQUISHED LrFE-DREAM.      453 harvests as I' in wealth of sacred thought from these fields of imagination!" "( Why, Rena, how strangely you talk," he interrupted. "Did you really desire the possession of that old home- stead?" "Not in reality," she answered, positively. "I have as good a title now as I ever want, for the possession would only fill my mind with the fragments of dreams that have forever perished. They may till arnd garner the products of its well-worn soil, while t will only claim the sweet memories that render it more lovely to me than other scenes, and which they cannot enter into." "You are a strange creature, Rena, and I am begin- ning to think you more wild and romantic than you ever were. What makes you talk so?" "I was not trying to be odd or fanciful," she re- sponded, listlessly. "I have only spoken the sentiments of my heart." "Well, come then, it is growing late," he whispered gently, as she paused in silence for a moment again be- side her baby's grave. "The air is growing very chill;" and he wrapped the shawl more closely about her tremb- ling form, fearing lest another grave might soon be made among those quiet shadows. "Dear little one," she murmured, as she turned again to cast a parting look upon the little mound. "I used to feel like he was lonely here without me, and when the bleak winds blew 1 almost shuddered that they must pass thus mercilessly over his little bed. But I can look above to see them now, and feel that these graves hold nothing    <pb n="454-455" xml:id="VAC6632-00000228"/> 454     LINDEN HILL; OR, THE more sacred, than the cast-off garments which they used to wear!" Philip drew her arm through his own and quietly led her away from the spot. "I may never come here again," she murmured, as he closed the little gate behind them; " but. it will not mat- ter. I can meet them just as soon from those sunny slopes and sunnier skies as here." And turning an angle in the road, the rural cemetery was soon lost to their view. "I suppose that you will want to go and see Bessle next?" was queried, as she leaned back wearily among the carriage cushions. "She will be quite lonely when you go away." "I know it," she responded. "And then when Birdie marries and goes away, she will be more lonely still. And poor, dear Bessie hasn't got the joy of a full assur- ance to brighten her life. She don't know how to extract sweetness from even the thistles of daily care." "Do you think that Madge will really go with us?" he asked, as leaving the village among the shadows they began to ascend their own loved hill. "I doubt it. She still says that she intends to go; that we shall not revel among flowers and sunshine and leave her here to brave the winds and snows of a northern climate. I think, however, that a cozy little cottage, with Will Lee's happy face to brighten it, will be tropical enough without going farther." "Well, he's a noble fellow, and as near whole-souled as this world ever makes! I think he will be a fortune   VA NQ UISHED LIFE-DREAM.     45'5 for her, with his true and upright character.

"Ah! but 'that's what's the matter,"' was the reply "These are too smart by far. Were I to occupy the place the ladies do, I should rather take a man who did not know so much than one who knows too much." "Well, Madge has always been too much for looking at the outside gilding, but hope she will make a good and faithful wife." "And there is Mrs. West waiting for you in the door. yard," he replied, as he reined the horse up in front of their own door. "She has been very kind in visiting you a:so much since you were sick. It has helped to lighten many a weary day. But come, you must go in." THE END. t'     </p>
